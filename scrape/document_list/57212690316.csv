Garbage strewn can cause many things, one of her dues is bins are overflowing due to the full so it can not accommodate the waste dumped from other people. Thus, the author created a new method for waste disposal more systematic. In creating new method requires a technology to supports, then the author makes a prototype for waste volume monitoring. By using the internet of things prototype of waste volume monitoring may give notification to the sanitary agency that waste in the trash bin needs to be disposal. In this study, conducted the design and manufactured of prototype waste volume monitoring using LinkItONE board based by Arduino and an ultrasonic sensor for appliance senses. Once the prototype is completed, evaluation in order to determine whether the prototype will function properly. The result showed that the expected function of a prototype waste volume monitoring can work well. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bins; Function evaluation; Internet of things; Manufacture; Indonesia; Jakarta; Waste disposal",,,,,"Zanella, A., Bui, N., Internet of Things for Smart Cities (2014) IEEE INTERNET of THINGS JOURNAL, 1 (1), pp. 22-32; Harmon, R.R., Enrique, G., Bhide, S., (2015) Internet of Things. 2015 Proceedings of PICMET'15: Management of the Technology Age, pp. 485-494; Hallaj Asghar, M., Mohammadzadeh, N., Negi, A., (2015) Principle Application and Vision in Internet of Things (IoT); Petrolo, R., Loscri, V., Mitton, N., (2014) Towards A Smart City Based on Cloud of Things, p. 61. , (Nord Europe, France: Inria Lille); http://www.thbs.com/downloads/Cloud-Computing-Overview.pdf, Torry Harris.

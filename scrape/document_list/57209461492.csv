The martial art fight and movement is usually the primary appeal and selling point. In the animation media such as movies or games, the animator does not necessarily have to be a practitioner of any martial art system but the animator will certainly going to need materials to study as references. This study aims to create alternative styles and poses of character design inspired by traditional martial art styles that often appear in various pictures, comics, and movies. Other goals are also to provide the animators a comprehensive and easy to use reference, for an easier and more effective level of animation production. Method of research is through the stages of observation and demonstration of the movements in the form of digitized data captured from a practitioner of traditional martial art movements, dissecting every meaning, purposes, and philosophy behind movements of the martial arts style. Finding and understanding the core concept of martial art body mechanic and philosophy behind its movements is crucial before turning it into re-illustration art of design. The result is a distinctive visual style and motion with unique traditional martial art poses. This method is expected to be a guide that makes animator has better understanding in the traditional martial art unique and distinctive body mechanic poses. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Physics; Body mechanics; Character designs; Digitized data; Martial art; Motion study; Animation",,,,,"Aditya, D.K., (2008), Revitalisasi Karakter Komik Superhero Lokal Indonesia Di Tengah-Tengah Dominasi Budaya Komik Global Master Theses Bandung; Latif, N., (2012) Perancangan Komik Fotografi Pramodawardhani, , (Yogyakarta: Pasca Sarjana ISI Yogyakarta); Ahmad, A.P.S., (2012) Perancangan Maskot Jakarta, , (Yogyakarta: Pasca Sarjana ISI Yogyakarta); Klein, C., (2004) Martial Arts and Globalization of US and Asian Film Industries, 2 (3), p. 360. , (USA: Massachusetts Institue of Technology)",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Advance and Scientific Innovation, ICASI 2018","23 April 2018 through 24 April 2018",,148653,17426588,,,,"English","J.

Syahdan No. 9, Kemanggisan, Palmerah, Jakarta, 11480, Indonesia","The novel respiratory illness of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is coming to us at an exponential speed: gradually, and then suddenly. It has spread to 160 countries and until March 31, 2020, infected more than 750,890 cases with 36,405 deaths (CFR 4.85%). Whereas Indonesia, with 1,528 cases and 136 deaths, had a CFR of 7.98%, which is a terrible country concern. In this paper, we propose a disinfection robot named as Nayakalara, which can be controller wireless using Mobile Apps and Bluetooth technology or in autonomous mode using 3 distance sensors. 12V pump is used for spraying the disinfectant with the range maximum about 2.5 meters. This is an alternative solution for spraying disinfectant remotely. We show the framework and analyze the experimental result. © 2021 ICIC International.","Bluetooth; CFR; COVID-19; Disinfection robot; Pump",,,,,"Binus University","This work was supported by BINUS University Grant 2020.",,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), , http://cdc.org, Accessed on 4 June 2020; WHO Data of Coronavirus, , https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data, Accessed on 1 June 2020; https://www.kemkes.go.id/, Ministry of Health Republic of Indonesia, Accessed on 6 July 2020; A Silent Epidemic?

This system can distinguish automatically odd and even the vehicle’s plate which is integrated with CCTV for electronic tickets. The methods are used in the approach for run length smearing algorithm, optical character recognition program, artificial neural networks backpropagation, and convolutional neural network techniques from deep learning with 3 × 3 and 4-layer filters. As a result of this system, the recognition of letters and numbers on the plate is still inaccurate. We display and evaluate approximately 90 percent accuracy of the experimental test.

The main purpose of this research is to predict travel duration from point A to point B and pinpoint route using neural networks, giving options of faster travel. Simply this paper’s purpose is to provide travel duration prediction for less time to travel to a destination. We will harness deep learning algorithms for calculating and predicting travel duration from available information as parameters. We implemented a Global Positioning System (GPS) to provide speed parameters, and a traffic map will then provide information about traffic conditions as the other parameter for travel prediction. Waze Iframe will provide map information for deep learning algorithms to classify traffic conditions. Deep learning algorithms are able to give out sets of predictions from data sets in this research from data training. © 2021 ICIC International.","Deep learning; GPS; Traffic condition; Travel duration; Travel prediction; Waze Iframe",,,,,,,,"Tang, J., Liu, F., Zou, Y., Zhang, W., Wang, Y., An improved fuzzy neural network for traffic speed prediction considering periodic characteristic (2017) IEEE Trans.

In this research, we would like to propose an Intelligent Humanoid Robot with the self-learning capability for accepting and giving responses from people based on Deep Learning and Big Data knowledge base. This kind of robot can be used widely in hotels, universities, and public services. The Humanoid Robot should consider the style of questions and conclude the answer through conversation between robot and user. In our scenario, the robot will detect the user’s face and accept commands from the user to do an action. Findings: The question from the user will be processed using deep learning, and the result will be compared to the knowledge base on the system. We proposed our Deep Learning approach, based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder, Convolution Neural Network (CNN) encoder, with Bidirectional Attention Flow (BiDAF). Conclusions: Our evaluation indicates that using RNN based encoder with BiDAF gives a higher score, than CNN encoder with the BiDAF.

The grand purpose of our research is to develop drones with implementation in smart farming in Indonesia. In the sending process, the drone must be able to detect objects and reach a goal position and go back safely using GNSS. We proposed the usage of course-over-ground information to help drone in doing autonomous navigation. In the experiment that we did, the average of positional deviation of landing position between the actual landing position and the desired landing position in the flight tests of flying from start to goal is 1.1125 meters and for the tests that use the algorithm which uses course-over-ground, the positional deviation has an average of 2.39 meters. Navigation using the course-over-ground algorithm is not more reliable than the navigation algorithm with GNSS and compass at a navigation distance of less than 1 meter. © ICIC International 2020.","Autonomous spraying drone; Drone; GNSS; Navigation systems; ROS; Sprayer pesticide",,,,,"Binus University","Acknowledgment.

A central research topic is how to stimulate learning and improve the quality of questions for learning evaluation by generating relevant questions with objective of learning and cognitive skill levels. This study presents an automated question generating method based on keyphrase to improve learning system in such way that the generated questions comply with both predetermined learning outcomes and Bloom's taxonomy of hierarchical cognitive skill levels. Unlike the prominent methods, this study proposed the learning materials written in local languages transformed into English which make the method applicable to learning material written in various languages given the language translation to English is available. In addition, the expert knowledge about keyphrase patterns in this study is represented in a set of context-free grammar rules making it possible to extend the pattern's rules to capture various keyphrase structures. The study which used 1,432 sentences from learning material written in Bahasa Indonesia can generate about 60,000 questions. From the experimentation, the average of Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score which is computed from the generated questions is 0.9566. This result indicates that the generated questions are well understood by human assessors. From sentiment analysis results, the generated questions achieve 0.73 classified as neutral, and 0.68 classified as objective. The Cohen-Kappa coefficient of 0.34589 means there is a difference between human evaluators in understanding the generated questions. © 2020 ICIC International.

This paper presents a hybrid user-collaborative, rule-based filtering recommendation system for education context. User profiles are represented by learning outcome scores and contextual information. The user-collaborative filtering method is used for predicting the targeted student’s learning outcome of a particular course. The predicted learning outcome combined with a set of decision rules are used for recommending some relevant link of learning materials to the targeted student. The initial contextual information which is assessed during the online program entrance test makes it possible for the proposed recommneder system to give automated recommendations to new students. The proposed method was tested using student learning outcome records from BINUS Online repository data. The results of performance evaluation of both recommender system with contextual information which achieves 458.22 MSE and the recommender system without contextual information which achieves 413.19 MSE are not significantly different. However, unlike the latter recommender system, the former recommender system has an advantage mainly that it can be used to give recommendation to the targeted students since their early program stage. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Collaborative filtering; Contextual information; Multi-criteria; Online learning; Recommendation system",,,,,,,,"Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: A survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions (2005) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 17 (6), pp. 734-749; Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., (2015) Context-Aware Recommender Systems, pp. 191-226. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4899-7637-6_6, Second ed., Recommender systems handbook; Aher, S.B., Lobo, L.M.R.J., Course (2012) Recommender System in E-Learning, 3 (1), pp. 159-164; Anandakumar, K., Rathipriya, K., Bharathi, A., A Survey on methodologies for personalized (2014) E-Learning Recommender Systems, pp. 4738-4743; Benhamdi, S., Babouri, A., Chiky, R., Personalized recommender system for E-learning environment (2017) Education and Information Technologies, 22 (4), pp. 1455-1477; Bozzon, A., Prandi, G., Valenzise, G., Tagliasacchi, M., A music recommendation system based on semantic audio segments similarity (2008) Proceedings of the IASTED International Conference on Internet and Multimedia Systems and Applications and Visual Communications, pp. 182-187; Cami, B.R., Hassanpour, H., Mashayekhi, H., (2017) A content-based movie recommender system based on temporal user preferences, pp. 121-125. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPIS.2017.8311601; Collins, A.D., Tkaczyk, A., Aizawabeel, J., (2018) A Study of Position Bias in Digital Library Recommender Systems, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06565, February; Corbi, A., Burgos, D., Review of current student-monitoring techniques used in ELearning-focused recommender systems and learning analytics.

The dataset used consisted of 93,000 pairs of questions. Data were trained repeatedly with a percentage of dataset 80:20 and classified using six levels in bloom's taxonomy and based on vector embedding. The results of this study prove that the encoder-decoder model with attention produces better and easier questions than other models. Evaluation of the question-producing system by comparing the two activation functions, namely hyperbolic tangential and sigmoid, shows that the sigmoid function can reduce the value of the loss function to 0.001, which means it can minimize the error factor. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Detection of retinopathy can be by analyzing the retinal image, using a deep learning approach, but the problem that is often faced is unbalanced data. In this study, a convolutional neural network architec- ture is proposed for the classification of retinopathy using the MESSIDOR database that has been labeled, by duplicating and augmentation of sample images in classes with low numbers of samples using a data generator to overcome the problem of unbalanced data. The experimental results show that the validation and testing accuracy performance on the model with two output classes are 100%, and 87.50%, while on the model with four output classes are 99.38%, and 76.47%.

The increasing popularity of online learning in recent years has given momentum to automated question generation in education field for facilitating learning process, learning material retrieval, and computer-based testing. This paper report on the development of question generation framework based on key-phrase method for online learning with a constraint that the generated questions should comply with the learning outcomes and skills from Bloom’s Taxonomy. The proposed method was tested using learning materials of Software Engineering course for undergraduate level written in Bahasa Indonesia obtained from Bina Nusantara’s (Binus’s) Online Learning repository. Using one-semester lecture material, this study generated 92,608 essay-type questions from 6-level Bloom’s Taxonomy which were further sampled randomly to obtain 120 question samples for method evaluation. Performance evaluation using average Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) involving five independent reviewers toward samples of these questions achieved 0.921 and 0.6 Cohen’s Kappa. The relevance of Bloom’s Taxonomy level of the generated questions was evaluated by means of classification model with 0.99 accuracy. The results indicate that not only are the generated questions well understood and agreed by the reviewers, they are also relevant to the expected Bloom’s Taxonomy level there for the questions can be delivered to students in the respected course delivery and evaluation. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bloom’s taxonomy; Context-free grammar; Keyphrase extraction; Question generation; Question template",,,,,"049 / LL3 / PG / 2020","This research was supported partially by the Directorate General of Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Indonesian Higher Education, as part of the Research Doctoral Dissertation Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Generating Questions Automatically in Online Learning Using Encoders-Decoders Using Attention” with Contract number: 049 / LL3 / PG / 2020.",,"Adamson, D., Bhartiya, D., Gujral, B., Kedia, R., Singh, A., Rosé, C.P., Automatically generating discussion questions (2013) In AIED, pp. 81-90. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_9; Al-Yahya, M., OntoQue: A question generation engine for educational assesment based on domain ontologies (2011) Proceedings of the 2011 11Th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies, ICALT 2011, pp. 393-395. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ICALT.2011.124, IEEE; Bloom, B.S., (1956) Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals; Chao, Z., Li, L., The combination of context information to enhance simple question answering (2018) Proceedings - 2018 5th international conference on behavioral, economic, and socio-cultural computing, BESC 2018, pp. 109-114; Diab, S., Sartawi, B., Classification of questions and learning outcome statements (LOS) into Bloom’s taxonomy (BT) by similarity measurements towards extracting of learning outcome from learning material (2017) International Journal of Managing Information Technology, 9 (2), pp. 01-12; Divate, M., Salgaonkar, A., Automatic question generation approaches and evaluation techniques (2017) Current Science, p. 113(9); Duan, N., Tang, D., Chen, P., Zhou, M., Question generation for question answering (2017) In EMNLP 2017 - Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Proceedings, pp. 877-885. , https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/d17-1090; Elsahar, H., Gravier, C., Laforest, F.F., Zero-shot question generation from knowledge graphs for unseen predicates and entity types (2018) NAACL-HLT, Abs/1802.0, pp. 218-228. , https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/n18-1020; Emu, I.H., Ahmed, A.U., Islam, M., Al Mamun, S., Uddin, A., An efficient approach for Keyphrase extraction from English document (2017) International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications, 9 (12), pp. 59-66; Gan, W., Yu, X., Automatic understanding and formalization of natural language geometry problems using syntax-semantics models (2018) ICIC International, 14 (1), pp. 83-98; Gleason, N.W., (2018) Higher education in the era of the fourth industrial revolution; Graesser, A.C., Rus, V., Cai, Z., Hu, X., Question answering and generation (2009) Applied Natural Language Processing: Identification, Investigation and Resolution, 1, pp. 1-16; Han, H., Yang, F., Huang, J., Zhou, B., CFXGBoost: Topic phrase extraction based on context features and XGBoost for knowledge base question answering (2018) ICNC-FSKD 2017 - 13Th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery, pp. 2397-2402. , https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2017.8393148, IEEE; Heilman, M., Smith, N.A., Good question!

A sophisticated military robot should be needed by the military/police because it can be deployed to the battlefield or the eradication of terrorism in a remote or autonomous manner. PID controller is known as a reliable and robust control system for servo motors as an actuator of the gun. In this paper, we propose a prototype of a tank-based military robot with object detection and tracking using PID controller for simulation of shooting the enemy target based on the computer vision. The object tracker has been built for detecting upper body of the target using a library in OpenCV and the tank will track until it reaches the best position to shoot the target.

There is much information and knowledge that are discussed among a lecturer and students in forums as a part of the learning process. The motivation of this study is to evaluate the learning process in a discussion forum through a dashboard, namely, the Dashboard of Knowledge (DoK). The DoK is formed using an Information Retrieval Architecture and Entity Relationship Diagram that is designed using four category interfaces. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the learning evaluation through the DoK is measured by a survey. The survey is conducted using three out of four dimensions of multi-criteria of the Web-based E-Learning System (WELS), namely, the Learner Interface, the System Context, and Personalization. The respondents of the survey are the heads of department that are DoK users. The results show that most respondents strongly agree that the DoK is useful for evaluating the learning in a discussion forum. This is exhibited by the survey results that show an average score of 3.53 out of 4.00 and 84.32% satisfaction. These results reveal that the DoK can effectively assist heads of department in monitoring the effectiveness of the learning process in a discussion forum. © 2013 IEEE.","Data warehouses; discussion forums; e-learning","Data warehouses; E-learning; Surveys; Discussion forum; Entity relationship diagrams; Four dimensions; Learning evaluations; Learning management system; Learning process; Personalizations; Web-based e-learning systems; Learning systems",,,,,,,"Garrison, D., Kanuka, H., Blended learning: Uncovering its transformative potential in higher education (2004) Internet Higher Edu., 7 (2), pp. 95-105. , Apr; Tripathi, R., Kurle, D., Jalgaonkar, S., Sarkate, P., Rege, N., Implementation of supplemental E-learning models for blended learning in pharmacology (2017) Nat.

Despite a discussion is opened by submitting a thread as the topic of discussion, however, the discussion may open out to different topics. This paper aims to present a model to find out a topic of discussion through latent semantic approach, named Topics Finding Model (TFM). The model proposes a complete step to reveal the topic of discussion from a thread in a discussion forum, consisting of the pre-processing text document, corpus classification and finding a topic. The model can be applied in various discussion forums and various languages with a few adjustments, such as stop-word removal list and stemming algorithm. The data were obtained from discussion forum in a learning management system. The data consist of 1050 posts divided into three different course subjects: information systems, management, and character building. The reason for using several course subjects is to observe consistency of the model. F-measure was used to measure the effectiveness of the model, and the results showed that the TFM was consistent and effective to reveal the topic of discussion, with a good precision. However, the recall can still be increased in a further study. © 2019, The Author(s).","Discussion forum; Latent semantic; Learning management system; Topics finding model",,,,,,,,"Baeza-Yates, R., Ribeiro-Neto, B., (2011) Modern Information Retrieval: The Concept and Technology behind Search (Second Edition), , Addison-Wesley Professional Harlow; Benedetti, F., Beneventano, D., Bergamaschi, S., Simonini, G., Computing inter-document similarity with context semantic analysis (2018) Information Systems, 80, pp. 136-147; Berger, A., Lafferty, J., Information retrieval as statistical translation (1999) In Proceedings of the 22Nd Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, , https://doi.org/10.1145/312624.312681; Botev, V., Marinov, K., Schäfer, F., Word importance-based similarity of documents metric (WISDM): Fast and scalable document similarity metric for analysis of scientific documents (2017) Proceedings of the 6Th International Workshop on Mining Scientific Publications, 7, pp. 17-23. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3127526.3127530; Cutting, D.R., Karger, D.R., Pedersen, J.O., Tukey, J.W., Scatter/gather: A cluster-based approach to browsing large document collections (2017) ACM SIGIR Forum, 51, pp. 148-159. , &; Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (1999) Proceedings of the fifteenth conference on uncertainty, pp. 1-7; Ezen-Can, A., Boyer, K.E., Kellogg, S., Booth, S., Unsupervised modeling for understanding MOOC discussion forums: A learning analytics approach (2015) In Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, pp. 146-150; Hofmann, T., Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (1999) Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 289-296; Hofmann, T., Unsupervised learning by probabilistic latent semantic analysis (2001) Machine Learning, 42 (1-2), pp. 177-196; Hong, C., Chen, W., Zheng, W., Shan, J., Chen, Y., Zhang, Y., Parallelization and characterization of probabilistic latent semantic analysis (2008) Parallel processing, 2008.

A sophisticated military robot is a robot that is needed by the military/police because it can be deployed to the battlefield or the eradication of terrorism that can be controlled remotely. This system is needed to reduce the remaining casualties from the army, and this combat robot system can also be operated at any time with more numbers than regular soldiers and with minimal operator needs. In this paper, we propose a prototype of a tank-based military robot with object detection and tracking and controlling using Android for simulation of shooting the enemy target. We propose an algorithm for controlling the robot using an HC-05 Bluetooth module.

In sending process, drone must be able to detect object and reach goal position and go back safely using GPS. We proposed a navigation algorithm for drone including the usage of course-over-ground information to help drone in doing autonomous navigation. In the experiment that we did, the average of positional deviation of landing position between the actual landing position and the desired landing position in the flight tests of flying from start to goal is 1.1125 m and for the tests that use the algorithm which uses course-over-ground, the positional deviation has average of 2.39 m.

In education context, automated logo detection and brand name recognition from digital image or video are very crucial as a learning tool to achieve learning outcomes. One technical issue in the logo detection and brand name recognition is its requirement to develop model that achive fast recognition speed and high recognition accuracy. One-stage detector is a breakthrough and innovative object detection framework; however, long duration and computing power required to carry out training and detection processes using the backbone deep architecture are often considered to be the challenge of this framework. The objective of this study is to propose a novel ResNet variant models using ResNet-50 as the basis. The empiric results showed that the model 2 achieved 0.408 mAP, the best average accuracy with training time 1.41 hour. The original Resnet50 model, in contrast, achieved 0.556 mAP average accuracy with 1.91 hour training time. The detection testing of the proposed Model 2 model was 23.47 fps, while the detection testing of Resnet50 model was 29.33 Fps. © 2019 IEEE.","Logo Detection; One Stage Detector; Resnet50","Brand recognition; Deep architectures; Detection framework; Detection process; Fast recognition; Learning outcome; Logo detections; Recognition accuracy; Object detection",,,,,,,"Liao, Y., Lu, X., Zhang, C., Wang, Y., Tang, Z., Mutual enhancement for detection of multiple logos in sports videos (2017) Proc.

In this research, we would like to propose humanoid robot with the self-learning capability based on Indonesian language and small vocabularies for accepting and giving response from people based on Natural Language Processing (NLP). This kind of robot can be used widely in schools, universities and public services. The humanoid robot should consider the style of questions and conclude the answer through conversation under unreliable automatic speech in noisy environment. In our scenario, robot will detect user's face and accept commands from the user to do an action, where the answer from user will be processed to the Google Translator and the result will be compared with vocabularies defined on the system. We describe how this formulation establish a promising framework by empirical results using subjects randomly.

The aim of this paper was to determine the appropriate topics for a discussion forum for learning management systems through enhanced probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) with the corpus classifier algorithm. In preparing the paper, the methods used were PLSA and the classifying process, which classifies the documents to become a corpus based on the similarity word approach. The similarity word is influenced by the term-frequency of the word in the document. The novel concept in this paper is the corpus classifier algorithm. The experiment was conducted using three approaches to discover the topic, and it used 4,868 distinct words from 234 documents. The documents were contained in three threads subject. The post of the discussion forum is the text document. The performance of the result was measured by the f-measure, which was calculated for each thread subject. The corpus classifier algorithm was used in the second approach, and third approach increased the average f-measure values for the second and third thread subjects by approximately 24 and 17%, respectively. © BEIESP.","Corpus classification; Discussion forum; PLSA; Similarity word; Topic findings",,,,,,,,"Chowdhury, A.K., Shanmugan, V., Information Technology: Impacts on Environment and Sustainable (2015) Pertanika J.

According to World Bank data, Indonesia is the country with the largest economic development in Southeast Asia. Unfortunately, the threat of terrorism in Indonesia is very large, therefore it requires a smart system such as military robots. Today's vision-based robot technology has also been used in the development of autonomous military robots. A sophisticated military robot is a robot that is needed by the military/police because it can be deployed to the battlefield or the eradication of terrorism in a remote or autonomous manner. This system is needed to reduce the remaining casualties from the army, and this combat robot system can also be operated at any time with more numbers than regular soldiers and with minimal operator needs. In this paper, we propose a prototype of a tank-based military robot with object detection and tracking and turrets for simulation of shooting the enemy target based on the computer vision. The object tracker will detect an upper body of the target using a library in OpenCV and the tank will track until it reaches the best position to shoot the target. The methods explained, and experimental results were presented. © 2019 IEEE.","computer vision; military robot; object detction; object tracker; turret","Economics; Intelligent robots; Object detection; Tanks (containers); Target tracking; Terrorism; Economic development; Military robots; Object detction; Object detection and tracking; object tracker; Robot technology; Southeast Asia; turret; Computer vision",,,,"Binus University

As a foundation to a broader study on smart LMS, this study focused on analyzing prominent study reports on recommender systems in general and online learning in particular. The SLR method analyzed papers published in the range of 2013-2018. Out of the 109 papers this study analyzed indepth 42 papers. The study findings confirmed that most of RS studies still focused on e-commerce, movies, tourists, and more whose most popular RS methods were collaborative filtering and content base. Some studies in RS for online education were mostly focused on scheduling, recommendations for courses, books, prospective students and others. The results of this study found that there are still much opportunities to develop methods and approaches for RS in online learning. This study findings gives foundation of our future research to develop a model of conscious contextual recommendation system using Machine Learning based on smart LMS for online learning. © 2018 IEEE.","distance learning; machine learning; online learning; Recommender System; smart LMS","Collaborative filtering; Distance education; Education computing; Electronic commerce; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Online systems; Recommender systems; Contextual recommendations; Learning management system; Literature reviews; NAtural language processing; On-line education; Online learning; smart LMS; Systematic literature review (SLR); E-learning",,,,,,,"Mothukuri, U.K., Improvisation of learning experience using Learning Analytics in eLearning, 2017; Za, O.R., (2002) Building a Recommender Agent for e-Learning Systems; Kong, X., Boll, S., Heuten, W., (2013) Towards Recommender Systems Supporting Knowledge Sharing and Transfer in Vocational Education and Training, pp. 25-30; Kumar, A., Open Problems in Recommender Systems Diversity, 2017, pp. 82-87; Salman, Y., Abu-Issa, A., Tumar, I., Hassouneh, Y., A model and prototype of a proactive multi-Type context-Aware recommender system 2017 Intell.

Many methods for face recognition such as holistic learning, the use of local features, shallow learning and deep learning, some methods are susceptible to variations in pose change, illumination, expression and age variation. State of the art of face recognition today is a deep learning technique that delivers high accuracy. In this paper author replicate an face recognition using deep learning architecture called OpenFace Convolutional Neural Network. In this research author make variation on the size of image, color dept and age, and see how that factor impact on accuracy of face recognition in that architecture. As the result from the research, the accuracy of a model depends on the image size, color depth, and age variation, but in OpenFace CNN that recognition still provides fairly good accuracy when reducing the size of image and color depth, as long as the image can still be detected on the landmark facial, so the alignment process can be done on the face image. © 2018 IEEE.","Age variant; Color Depth; Convolutional Neural Network; Face Recognition; Image Size","Color; Convolution; Deep learning; Network architecture; Neural networks; Age variant; Biometric authentication; Color depth; Convolution neural network; Convolutional neural network; Image Size; Learning architectures; Learning techniques; Face recognition",,,,,,,"Turk, M., Pentland, A., Eigenfaces for recognition (1991) J.

The chatbot model used is a cahatbot model across business/service fields. The training data used in this research are the data on customer service talks with its customers in several business fields or services. To compare the models generated from the LSTM algorithm and Simple RNN algorithm, two tests were carried out, the first test is testing the chat output manually which was done directly by humans and the second test are comparing the LSTM algorithm and Simple RNN algorithms using the same training data and test data. From the experimental results, it was found that the chat output generated by the LSTM algorithm relatively can answer most of the tests correctly rather than Simple RNN algorithm. From the experiment, it was also found that the learning process in the LSTM algorithm takes longer than the learning process on the Simple RNN algorithm. © 2018 IEEE.","Bahasa Indonesia; Chatbot; LSTM; RNN","Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Testing; Chatbot; Customer services; Indonesia; Learning process; LSTM; Simple recurrent neural networks; Test data; Training data; Long short-term memory",,,,,,,"Eason, G., Noble, B., Sneddon, I.N., On certain integrals of Lipschitz-Hankel type involving products of Bessel functions (1955) Phil.

Self-diagnostics of teaching can range from personal reflection to formal assessment intended for specific purposes. This paper proposes a novel application of self-diagnostics using fuzzy logic for teaching-learning quality improvement for lecturers, so lecturers recognize the weaknesses and advantages of teaching ability. We use 6 variables as input that consists of openness, clear and understandably, enthusiastic, teaching methods, feedback and commitment for evaluating his performance. The results show that our proposed method is able to evaluate the level of quality of teaching-learning with some suggestions for improvement of the lecturers. Based on the evaluation of exam and quiz after lecturer improves his/her capability in teaching, there is improvement of score 20% for exam and 30% for quiz compared with previous evaluation. © 2019, ICIC International.

To support this concept, we designed an artificial neural network (ANN) using backpropagation, stochastic learning, and steepest gradient descent algorithms to determine teacher engagement based on the Indonesian Teacher Engagement Index (ITEI). The resulting ANN may be used in a data-gathering website for teachers to use for self-evaluation and self-intervention. The optimal architecture for the ANN has 44 input nodes, 26 first hidden layer nodes, 20 second hidden layer nodes, and 7 output nodes, with a learning rate of 0.05 and trained over 5000 iterations. The sample data used for training was gathered by ITEI researchers and the Executive Board of Indonesian Teachers Association (Pengurus Besar Persatuan Guru Republik Indonesia, PB-PGRI) and includes data of teachers from all around Indonesia. The maximum accuracy of this ANN was 97.98%.

Despite its high accuracy, the model was not practical when high computing power was not available. Thus, deep model with not-so-deep structure or less number of model parameters is needed for low capacity computer. Logo and brand recognition task is an important and challenging problem in computer vision with wide potential applications. The inherent challenge to address this task is not only due to the presence of logo in various direction and clutters as well as imbalanced dataset but also because of high computing workload when deep learning models were adopted. This paper presents empirical results of logo recognition method using MiniVGGNet and MiniGoogleNet models combined with augmentation technique to increase variation and number of samples. The results show that the proposed model combined with augmentation technique increased accuracy of model accuracies and fasten training convergence of both models. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Augmentation technique; Logo detection; MiniGoogLeNet; MiniVGGNet","Database systems; Marketing; Augmentation techniques; Brand recognition; Computing workloads; Imbalanced dataset; Logo detections; MiniGoogLeNet; MiniVGGNet; Number of samples; Deep learning",,,,,"Acknowledgment.

Traditionally, it is used by customers inside the store to transport goods to the cashier during shopping and designed not to leave the store. It is an inconvenience and time wasted for customers who want to find the desired product in the store by using the traditional shopping trolley. Our goal is to develop an automatic moving trolley with smart shopping devices to solve the problem. Our smart shopping trolley is based on a two-wheeled mobile robot, developed in our previous research. This paper presents the hardware and software design of a smart trolley system. Our smart trolley used IOIO microcontroller and Android smartphone as sensors and controller. The trolley is modeled as a two-wheeled mobile robot. Android smartphone will control the robot by sending a signal to IOIO microcontroller paired with a robot's actuator and monitor the situation using the smartphone camera. Furthermore, we exploited the smartphone compass for robot navigation. This system is also equipped with the indoor positioning system to detect user position using Navisens which based on gyroscope and accelerometer in the smartphone. Finally, the results of the testing on robot navigation are presented. The result is our smart trolley system based on Navisens framework can move and show its location to the user. © 2019 The Authors.

The authors use tweets from President Candidates of Indonesia (Jokowi and Prabowo), and tweets from relevant hashtags for sentiment analysis gathered from March to July 2018 to predict Indonesian Presidential election result. The authors make an algorithm and method to count important data, top words and train the model and predict the polarity of the sentiment.

For stockbrokers, understanding trends and forecasting supported by software are very important to decision making and reacting to changes in behavioral patterns. This paper proposes an algorithm and model for market forecasting in Indonesian exchange based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and compared with ARIMA model. We use data from Bank Central Asia (BCA) from 2013-2018 obtained from Yahoo finance. In our experiments, we predict and simulate the important prices called Open, High, Low and Closing (OHLC) with various parameters. Based on the experiment, the best accurate prediction in LSTM comes from the short term (1 year) with high epoch in training phase rather than using 3 years or 5 years of training data, and our model has better result compared with popular model such as ARIMA.

This paper proposes an innovative technology and design which enables patient to control electric wheelchair’s movement using voice recognition and joystick. In this paper, we described the design of low-cost and robust wheelchair and then presented the evaluation of the system. Voice recognition module can control the wheelchair to move forward, left, right and stop, and in addition, there is the reverse mode in the joystick module. Next, the speaker dependent module is applied to wheelchair control systems by training the voice recognition module. The controller system is based on Arduino and combined with high current driver motor with gearbox and two batteries for power systems. The accuracy of the detection using speaker independent (SI) pre-programmed commands is 72.5% and user-defined speaker dependent is 85%.

Using the analysis in the forum log post discussion of this research was carried out through several stages. The first stage, the random selection of 5 classes taken by the forum data, the second stage, carried out text mining analysis from the posts of students and lecturers, the third stage, analyzing text validation using lecture notes that have been used as data sets in the form of corpus. This study uses the doc2v algorithm with vectorization. The results of this study found that the percentage of similarities between lecturers' posts, students and lecture notes only reached 49% of the target we expected at least 80%. Because discussion forums are a substitute for face-to-face sessions on face-to-face learning.

We will exploit the drone technology for transporting items efficiently. In sending process, our drone must detect the object target, where the items will be delivered. Therefore, we need object detection module that can detect what is in video stream and where the object is by using GPS as well. To implement the module, we use combination of MobileNet and the Single Shot Detector (SSD) framework for fast and efficient deep learning-based method to object detection.

The objective of this paper is to elaborate how natural language processing (NLP) and pattern matching approach works in question answering system for solving arithmetic word problems. Upon receiving a Indonesian arithmetic word problem, the robot will translate Indonesian speech to English text, resolve conjunction problem, co-references problem, question preprocessing, question analysis, represent the knowledge, and lastly the robot will answer the solution. We employed NLP for English by using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in our research. Based on the experiment results, it can be concluded that: (i) the accuracy of the question answering system for each scheme ranges from 80% to 100% depend on the difficulty to comprehend the word problem, (ii) the response time is rather slow with average processing time is about 1.12 minutes. © 2018 The Authors.

The purpose of this research is to create an application that translates thoughts to text which will be implemented in SMS feature by taking raw EEG from Emotiv EPOC, filtering, and applying machine learning algorithm, which is Support Vector Machine. There are two research steps: Analysis and implementation. In the analysis step, the EEG samples taken from respondents are used for analyzing the most dominant channel. Then, EEG signal extraction uses Emotiv EPOC SDK, filters EEG signal taken from the most dominant channel and applies SVM algorithm for data training.

Task ranking is one of the problems that can be solved by using a machine learning algorithm ranking problem. This work focuses on finding the right approach and corresponding algorithms in the process of ranking to be able to help people in determining which jobs have a higher priority than others. Our approach is to compare several algorithms performed in the process of ranking that are Bipartite Ranking, k-partite Ranking, and Ranking by pairwise comparison. We're used questionnaires and deployment of prototype of Intelligent Personal Assistant Agent to apply the appropriate algorithm in intelligence agent in arranging task priority in daily activity that must be done by the users. After training dataset and evaluate the validation dataset using NDCG, it is found that the collaborative ranking used have a more accurate value / lower variance test evaluation because it uses a large dataset and smaller training dataset. We found that labeling for more than 2 values it is not recommended to use a bipartite ranking if there are many repetitive data, both k-partite ranking and rank by pairwise comparison are able to be used for multi-dimensional data labeling. © 2017 IEEE.","Bipartite Ranking; Intelligence Agent; K-partite Ranking; Ranking by pairwise comparison; Task Ranking","Artificial intelligence; Computer networks; Data handling; Learning systems; Statistical tests; Surveys; Bipartite Ranking; Intelligence agents; K-partite; Ranking by pairwise comparisons; Task Ranking; Learning algorithms",,,,,,,"Hang, L.I., A short introduction to learning to rank The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers, Special Section on Information-Based Induction Sciences and Machine Learning, 94 (10). , October 2011; Yorke-Smith, N., Saadati, S., Myers, K.L., Morley, D.N., The design of a proactive personal agent for task management (2012) International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools, 21 (1), p. 1250004; Geng, X., Luo, L., Multilabel ranking with inconsistent rankers 2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3742-3747; Förnkranz, J., Höllermeier, E., Preference learning: An introduction in johannes förnkranz and eyke höllermeier (ed (2010) Preference Learning Springer, pp. 1-17; Cheng, W., Huhn, J., Hullermeier, E., Decision tree and instance-based learning for label ranking (2009) Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 161-168. , Montreal, Canada; Förnkranz, J., Höllermeier, E., Preference learning and ranking by pairwise comparison in johannes förnkranz and eyke höllermeier (2010) Preference Learning Springer, pp. 65-82; Vembu, S., Gärtner, T., Label ranking algorithms: A survey in johannes förnkranz and eyke höllermeier (2010) Preference Learning Springer, pp. 45-64; Raykar, V.C., Yu, S., Eliminating spammers and ranking annotators for crowdsourced labelling tasks (2008) Artificial Intelligence, 172, pp. 1897-1916. , Elsevier; Agarwal, S., Surrogate regret bounds for bipartite ranking via strongly proper losses (2014) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 15, pp. 1653-1674; Agarwal, S., Roth, D., (2005) Learnability of Bipartite Ranking Functions, , P.

We would like to propose behavior-based humanoid robot with the proposed model and algorithms to be used by robot to teach basic mathematics and give entertainment such as storytelling and singing. This kind of robot can be used in schools. In our scenario, robot will detect and recognizes user's face and accept commands from the user to do an action such as giving tutorial and questions, specifically in teaching basic mathematics, where the answer from user will be processed to the Google Translator and the result will be compared with vocabularies defined on the system. The comparative experiments with samples from students were presented. © 2017 IEEE.","Behavior-based humanoid robot; Humanoid robot; Indonesian language; Mathematics","Anthropomorphic robots; Education computing; Intelligent robots; Mathematical techniques; Robots; Students; Teaching; Basic mathematics; Behavior-based; Comparative experiments; Humanoid robot; Indonesian languages; Intelligent humanoid robots; Model and algorithms; Natural interactions; Educational robots",,,,,,,"Feil-Seifer, D., Matari, M.J., Ethical principles for socially assistive robotics (2011) IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine, 18 (1), pp. 24-31; Jones, L., Robot, J., (2004) Programming: A Practical Guide to Behavior-Based Robotics; Khan, P.H., What is a human?

In this research, we would like to propose Intelligent Coffee Maker Robot with the speech recognition based on Indonesian language using small vocabulary and statistical dialogue systems. This kind of robot can be used in the office, supermarket or restaurant. In our scenario, robots will recognize the user’s face and then accept commands from the user to do an action, specifically in making 3 types of coffee, espresso, double espresso and latte, where the answer from the user will be processed to the Google Translator and the result will be compared with simple vocabulary in Indonesian language. The main problem here is to know the intention of users about how sweetness of the coffee. The intelligent coffee maker robot should conclude the user’s intention through conversation under unreliable automatic speech in noisy environment. In this paper, this spoken dialog problem is treated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We describe how this formulation establishes a promising framework by empirical results. The dialog simulations are presented which demonstrate significant quantitative outcomes. © 2017 ICIC International.","Coffee maker; POMDP; Speech recognition; Statistical dialogue systems; Vocabulary",,,,,,"This work is fully supported by Hosei University-Tokyo as a visiting researcher in 2016.",,"(2012) Service Robots, , http://www.ifr.org/service-robots/, IFR; Pieska, S., Luimula, M., Jauhiainen, J., Spiz, V., Social service robots in wellness and restaurant applications (2013) Journal of Communication and Computer, 10, pp. 116-123; Graf, B., Parlitz, C., Hägele, M., Robotic home assistant Care-O-bot ® 3 product vision and innovation platform (2009) Human-Computer Interaction, Part II, HCII 2009, LNCS 5611, , Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg; (2010) Restaurant Service Robot FURO-R, , http://www.futurerobot.com/contentseng/sub42.htm, Future Robot; Budiharto Meiliana, W., Gunawan, A.A.S., Development of coffee maker service robot using speech and face recognition systems using POMDP (2016) The 1St International Workshop on Pattern Recognition, , Tokyo, Japan; Nakadai, K., Nakajima, H., Hasegawa, Y., Tsujino, H., Sound source separation of moving speakers for robot audition, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics (2009) Speech and Signal Processing, pp. 3685-3688; Williams, J.D., Young, S., Partially observable Markov decision processes for spoken dialog systems (2007) Journal Computer Speech and Language, 21 (2), pp. 393-422; Young, S., Gaši, M., Thomson, B., Williams, J.D., POMDP-based statistical spoken dialog systems: A review (2013) Proc. of the IEEE, 101 (5), pp. 1160-1179; Fox, D., Thrun, S., (2006) Wolfram Burgard, Probabilistic Robotics, , MIT Press; Gorin, A.L., Riccardi, G., Wright, J.H., How may I help you?

The ability to control ourselves not eating emotionally is a crucial aspect for our health. We present a simple and novel approach for detecting physical or emotional hunger using Bayesian belief networks and psychological aspects. A novel approach is proposed where the user asks whether he/she is thirsty, then some action should be done such as drinking and answering some questions, and the result and suggestion are then displayed. Bayesian belief networks use 3 nodes: thirsty, mood and social media to improve the accuracy of hunger prediction. A hunger and discovery scale concept as parameter of the output is used. This Android app is very useful for people to avoid emotional hunger. Based on the experiment, concept of physical and emotional hunger can apply the application able to show the prediction of his/her hunger. © 2017 ICIC International.","Bayesian belief network; Emotional eating; Hunger detection; Intuitive eating",,,,,"Binus University","The authors wish to thank to BINUS University for supporting this research.

HR signs occur because of narrowing of the arteries in the retina, bleeding in the retina of the eye and cotton wool spots. The diagnosis is conventionally performed by an ophthalmologist by performing fundus image analysis to determine the phases of HR disease symptoms. This paper proposes an early detection system of hypertensive retinopathy disease.

Classic research in psychology found that stability of marriage is based on the ability to create and maintain a positive interaction ratio five times more than negative interactions. Based on that, we present Counselove, a mobile application intended to record information of daily positive behaviors (joking, showing affection) of couples who use the application. We propose a method where the apps can determine users' marital satisfaction level and also can help users increasing their marital satisfaction based on the relationship satisfaction questionnaire and the assessment of user's self reported behaviors to their partners using fuzzy logic. The experimental results shown the application is running well on mobile devices based on Android platform. Lastly, we provide result of in depth interview with two users. Further research and development of the Counselove apps are discussed. Copyright © 2017 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Previously, humanoid robot focused on the architecture of body and ethical issues, but later, it is predicted that humanoid robots should consider teaching behaviour, student's interest and speech understanding. They are expected to conclude the answer through conversation under noisy environment. We propose speech recognition systems based on Google translator and basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as stemming and tokenization. We do teach modules for elementary school in order that the robot can interact with students naturally based on psychological aspects. We also discuss about our recent humanoid robot for education in elementary school that has ability to detect user's face and accepts commands in sentences from the user to do any actions such as giving tutorial and answering questions. The average accuracy for correct recognition is 73.3% and correct answer is 63.3%. Our speech recognition system is more promising compared with NAO robot. © 2017 The Authors.

BSS is a problem of separation of several speech signals in a real world from mono or stereo audio record. In this research, we implement BSP system using DUET algorithm which allow to separate any number of sources by using only stereo (two) mixtures. The DUET (Degenerate Unmixing Estimation Technique) algorithm replaces our previous FastICA (Fast Independent Component Analysis) method only success in simulation but failed in the implementation. The main problem of FastICA is that it assumes instantaneous mixing without time delay in the recording process. To deals with audio record in the presence of inevitable time delays, it has to be replaced with DUET algorithm to separate well in real time. Finally, the DUET algorithm is implemented to humanoid robot which is developed using Raspberry Pi and equipped with RaspPi Cam to detect human face. Furthermore, the Cirrus Logic Audio Card is stacked to Raspberry Pi in order to record stereo audio. In our experiments, there are three controlled variables to evaluate algorithm performance, that is: distance, number of sources, and subject's name. Robot will record stereo audio for four seconds after face is detected by system. The recording is then separated by DUET algorithm and produce two source estimations with average computation time 1.8 seconds. With Google API, the recognition accuracy of separated speech is varying between 40%-70%. © 2017 The Authors.

Mango maturity level often makes farmers confused when choosing a mango that has a good maturity. Sometimes, mango farmers still use manual methods to distinguish mango maturity, while the way that human labor is often inaccurate and different in its determination. The difference is due to the different perceptions of each person. From these problems then the need of machine sorting system on agriculture is felt important. Therefore, researchers will conduct research on mango sortation system. Mango has many types such as ""Harum Manis"", ""Apple"", ""Gincu"", etc. In this study type of mango that will be studied is mango ""Gincu"" because has a good color distribution. The goal of the research is to create a system that can sort mango that ripe or unripe. The method that used to do this research is separated into few step: problem identification, algorithm development, implementation and evaluation. The system is made using C language, Computer Vision and ANN (Artificial Neural Network) so the system can detect the color of mango that has been ripe or unripe. The output of this research will be compared to related research. The final output of this research is the system can detect the ripe or unripe mango with 94% accuracy. © 2017 The Authors.

Unfortunately the development of interesting and entertaining adaptive multiplayer game based learning for math and science that consider psychological aspects and game balancing for students on mobile platforms that have game balancing is very limited. This paper proposes an integrated model of adaptive Math and Science game based learning for elementary school students with adjustable level of difficulty based on user's ability and additional option for ""Free"" and ""Adventures"" modes. We propose a method where level of difficulty can be adjusted based on previous score, using fuzzy two inputs in the form of percentage correct and the speed of answer to produce output.

In swarm robot systems, each robot must cooperate with other robots in order to perform a given task. The main obstacle in swarm robot research is the cost of making robots. Building one robot with limited capabilities commonly has to spend substantial amount of money and certainly making robots for intelligent systems research need much more investment. In this paper, we would like to present the development of affordable mobile robot, but also having powerful capabilities and intelligence. The mobile robot is specifically designed and made to be used as a stand-alone or in swarm robot systems. It is essential that the mobile robot has learning ability to adapt the dynamic environments. Furthermore, for swarm robot systems, each mobile robot must be able to communicate with other robots in order to coordinate each other. In our research, we used differential drive model for mobile robot locomotion and then apply the model through Android smartphone based controller. The mobile robot was constructed by using two actuators on the right and left side, and one castor wheel which has no steering system and can move freely. The differences velocity between left and right actuators determines the direction and final position of the mobile robot. The angular velocity of two main actuators is set by Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) parameter in IOIO board microcontroller. In our experiment, we showed that the capability of our robot in performing several movement tasks. We are sure that Android based robotic platforms are ideal candidates for affordable robotics for swarm robot system research. © 2017 The Authors.

Based on our previous work, the accuracy for speech recognition is about 86% and face recognition is about 93% in laboratory experiments. The main problem in here is to know the intention of user about how sweetness of the coffee. The intelligent coffee maker robot should conclude the user intention through conversation under unreliable automatic speech in noisy environment.

However, the Black-Scholes formula is generally used in determining the price of the option does not involve skewness factor and it is difficult to apply in computing process because it produces oscillation for the skewness values close to zero. In this paper, we construct option pricing formula that involve skewness by modified Black-Scholes formula using Shifted Poisson model and transformed it into the form of a Linear Approximation in the complete market to reduce the oscillation. The results are Linear Approximation formula can predict the price of an option with very accurate and successfully reduce the oscillations in the calculation processes. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,,,"Martinkute-Kauliene, R., (2012) Business, Management and Education, 10 (2), pp. 289-301; Miller, L., Bertus, M., (2013) Business Education & Accreditation, 5; Sunaryo, T., (2009) Manajemen Resiko Finansial, , Salemba Empat, Jakarta; Zhu, Z., Hanson, F.B., (2013) Social Science Research Network; Gerber, H., Landry, B., (1997) North American Actuarial Journal, 1; Black, F., Scholes, M., (1973) Journal of Political Economy, 81; Hull, J.C., (2012) Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives, , Pearson Prentice Hall, New Jersey; Gerber, H., Shiu, E., (1996) Insurance: Mathematics and Economics, 18; Boyle, (1997) Financial Economics: With Applicationsin Insurance and Pensions, , Schaumburg: in press; Lin, S., (2009) Introductory Stochastic Analysis for Finance and Insurance, , John Willey & Sons, Inc, Canada; Gerber, H., Shiu, E., (1997) North American Actuarial Journal, p. 1",,,"","EDP Sciences","2013 International Conference on Advances Science and Contemporary Engineering, ICASCE 2013","23 October 2013 through 24 October 2013","Jakarta",,21016275,,,,"English","EPJ Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901411647

The method mostly used for character recognition is the backpropagation network. Backpropagation network has been known for its accuracy because it allows itself to learn and improving itself thus it can achieve higher accuracy. On the other hand, backpropagation was less to be used because of its time length needed to train the network to achieve the best result possible. In this study, backpropagation network algorithm is combined with genetic algorithm to achieve both accuracy and training swiftness for recognizing alphabets. Genetic algorithm is used to define the best initial values for the network's architecture and synapses' weight thus within a shorter period of time, the network could achieve the best accuracy. The optimized backpropagation network has better accuracy and less training time than the standard backpropagation network. The accuracy in recognizing character differ by 10, 77%, with a success rate of 90, 77% for the optimized backpropagation and 80% accuracy for the standard backpropagation network. The training time needed for backpropagation learning phase improved significantly from 03 h, 14 min and 40 sec, a standard backpropagation training time, to 02 h 18 min and 1 sec for the optimized backpropagation network. © 2013 Science Publications.","Backpropagation network; Genetic algorithm; Optical character recognition; Optimized artificial neural network",,,,,,,,"Gregoire, B.O., Neural Networks: Tricks of the Trade (2012) 2nd Edn., Springer London, Limited, ISBN- 10:364235288X, p. 781; Karlik, B., Olgac, A.V., Performance analysis of various activation functions in generalized MLP architectures of neural networks (2010) Int.

Option price determination is affected by risk factor. However in Black-Scholes model option price is determined without arbitrage risk affection so it is impossible to take return. In this study, option price formula is constructed to be more represent the condition of financial market using incomplete market concept where financial asset, that is traded, is affected by arbitrage risk so it is possible for market participants to take return. European call option is defined by Esscher Transform method and option price formula is determined by changing its form to linear approximation. The result from this study is option price formula with linear approximation has some privileges. That is easy to be applied in computation process, more representatives in getting risk indication in the financial market and can predict option price more accurately. Linear approximation formula is applied in the program that can be used by option writer or holder and is equipped with export data feature that can be possible for further research development. © 2014 Science Publications.","European call option; Incomplete market; Linear approximation",,,,,,,,"Model investasi harga saham tipe eropa dengan menggunakan model black-scholes (2009), Unpublished Thesis, University of Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

We assume that this model of humanoid robot is used as a service robot to deliver a cup to customer from starting point to destination point. We have successfully developed and introduced three main modules to recognize faces, to identify multiple moving obstacles and to initiate a maneuver. A group of people who are walking will be tracked as multiple moving obstacles. Predefined maneuver to avoid obstacles is applied to robot because the limitation of view angle from stereo camera to detect multiple obstacles. The contribution of this research is a new method for multiple moving obstacles avoidance strategy with Bayesian approach using stereo vision based on the direction and speed of obstacles. Depth estimation is used to obtain distance calculation between obstacles and the robot. We present the results of the experiment of the humanoid robot called Gatotkoco II which is used our proposed method and evaluate its performance. The proposed moving obstacles avoidance strategy was tested empirically and proved effective for humanoid robot. © 2013 Licensee InTech.","Bayesian approach; Humanoid service robot; Obstacles avoidance; Stereo vision","Bayesian approaches; Destination points; Distance calculation; Humanoid service robot; Indoor environment; Moving obstacles; Multiple moving obstacles; Obstacles avoidance; Bayesian networks; Mobile robots; Stereo vision; Anthropomorphic robots",,,,,,,"Acosta, L., González, E.J., Rodríguez, J.N., Hamilton, A.F., Méndez, J.A., Hernéndez, S., Sigut, S.M., Marichal, G.N., Design and implementation of a service robot for a restaurant (2006) International Journal of Robotics and Automation., 21 (4), pp. 273-281; Qing-Wiau, Y., Can, Y., Zhuang, F., Yan-Zheng, Z., Research of the localization of restaurant service robot (2010) International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems., 7 (3), pp. 227-238; Maier, D., Self-supervised obstacle detection for humanoid navigation using monocular vision and sparse laser data (2011) IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation., pp. 1263-1269; Masako, K., Daisu, K., Autonomous mobile robot navigation using active stereo vision (2000) Intelligent Autonomous Systems 6., pp. 1041-1048. , IOS Press; Purwanto, D., (2001) Visual Feedback Control in Multi-Degrees-of-Freedom Motion System., , PhD thesis at Graduate School of Science and Technology-Keio University, Japan; Etemad, K., Chellappa, R., Discriminant analysis for recognition of human face images (1997) Journal of the Optical Society of America A: Optics and Image Science, and Vision, 14 (8), pp. 1724-1733; Belhumeur, P.N., Kriegman, D.J., What Is the Set of Images of an Object under All Possible Illumination Conditions?

The service robot in this research is programmed to deliver a drinking cup to the recognized customer from a specified starting point. We have developed three main modules: one for face recognition, one to identify obstacles, and one to maneuver. The detection of static obstacles, which is based on information from the landmark, uses an edge-detection method and is used to generate a planned path. The speed, direction and distance of the moving obstacle are measured by using vision and distance sensors in order for the robot to make a maneuver. Algorithms for obstacle avoidance for service robots are proposed and a new geometrical model is introduced for service robots to make a good avoidance maneuver. The main aim of this research is to provide a complete mechanism for obstacle avoidance by a vision-based service robot, whereas popular obstacle avoidance methods such as PVM do not provide such a feature. We present the results of an experiment with a service robot in which our proposed method was implemented, after which we evaluate its performance.","Moving obstacle; Obstacles avoidance; Robot vision; Service robot","Distance sensors; Geometrical models; Indoor environment; Main module; Moving obstacles; Obstacles avoidance; Service robots; Static obstacles; Vision based; Face recognition; Mobile robots; Computer vision",,,,,,,"Acosta, L., González, E.J., Rodríguez, J.N., Hamilton, A.F., Méndez, J.A., Hernéndez, S., Sigut, S.M., Marichal, G.N., Design and Implementation of a Service Robot for A Restaurant (2006) International Journal of Robotics and Automation, 21 (4), pp. 273-281; Qing-Wiau, Y., Can, Y., Zhuang, F., Yan-Zheng, Z., Research of the Localization of Restaurant Service Robot (2010) International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems, 7 (3), pp. 227-238; Borenstein, J., Koren, Y., The Vector Field Histogram - Fast Obstacle Avoidance for Mobile Robots, in proc (1991) IEEE Trans.

We assume that this model of service robot is used to deliver a cup to the recognized customer from the starting point to the destination. The contribution of this research is a new method for multiple moving obstacle avoidance with Bayesian approach using stereo camera. We have developed and introduced 3 main modules to recognize faces, to identify multiple moving obstacles and to maneuver of robot. A group of people who is walking will be tracked as a multiple moving obstacle, and the speed, direction, and distance of the moving obstacles is estimated by a stereo camera in order that the robot can maneuver to avoid the collision. To overcome the inaccuracies of vision sensor, Bayesian approach is used for estimate the absense and direction of obstacles. We present the results of the experiment of the service robot called Srikandi III which uses our proposed method and we also evaluate its performance. Experiments shown that our proposed method working well, and Bayesian approach proved increasing the estimation perform for absence and direction of moving obstacle. © 2011 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Multiple moving obstacles; Obstacle avoidance; Service robot; Stereo vision","Bayesian networks; Cameras; Collision avoidance; Computer vision; Mobile robots; Robots; Stereo vision; Bayesian approaches; Indoor environment; Moving obstacles; Multiple moving obstacles; Service robots; Stereo cameras; Vision sensors; Working well; Stereo image processing",,,,,,,"Acosta, L., González, E.J., Rodríguez, J.N., Hamilton, A.F., Méndez, J.A., Hernéndez, S., Sigut, S.M., Marichal, G.N., Design and Implementation of a Service Robot for A Restaurant (2006) International Journal of robotics and automation, 21 (4), pp. 273-281; Qing-wiau, Y., Can, Y., Zhuang, F., Yan-Zheng, Z., Research of the Localization of Restaurant Service Robot (2010) International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems, 7 (3), pp. 227-238; Chatib, O., Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance for Manipulators and Mobile Robots (1986) The International Journal of Robotics Research, 5 (1), pp. 90-98; Borenstein, J., Koren, Y., The Vector Field Histogram- Fast Obstacle Avoidance for Mobile Robots (1991) IEEE Trans.

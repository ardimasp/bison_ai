And finally this research produces a Framework that presents a technology governance model for updating strategic plans and governance models for technology and frameworks designed to meet the needs of the elderly population and as recommendations for smart home management that aim to measurably improve the welfare of people in Indonesia. The proposed model and strategy recognizes the diversity of the community with existing providers of household tools and developers to optimize resources to achieve the goals and objectives of elderly smart home residents. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Mobile agents; Architectural research; Business modeling; Business platforms; Elderly populations; Governance models; Mobile agent technology; Open services gateway initiatives; Technology planning; Automation",,,,,"Albino, V., Berardi, U., Dangelico, R.M., Smart cities: Definitions, dimensions, performance, and initiatives (2015) Journal of Urban Technology, 22 (1), pp. 3-21; Hollands, R.G., Will the real smart city please stand up?

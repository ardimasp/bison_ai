The formulated glucomannan–beeswax–chitosan edible coating is applied to minimally processed salak, and the characteristics of the edible coating are evaluated. The glucomannan–beeswax–chitosan edible coating not just successfully reduces the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (10%, compared to control, that is, the salak fruit coated with glucomannan only), but also decreases the water vapor transfer rate that penetrates salak fruit (by 27% vs control), and lowers the weight loss of salak fruit (<4%, compared to that of control (10% weight loss)). Peeled salak fruit coated with glucomannan–beeswax–chitosan maintains its quality at room temperature in 3 days, without any indication of mold growth. Based on the results in this study, glucomannan–beeswax–chitosan edible coating is a promising antimicrobial edible polymer coating for minimally processed salak fruit, and possibly for other varieties of fruits. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

With the addition of ZnO nanoparticles of 0.048% w/w in a solution containing 4% gelatin, the fabricated bionanocomposite film decreases the water vapor transfer rate by 27.54%, increases the tensile strength by 61.32%, reduces polymer film elongation by 60%, and inhibits the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli by more than 90%, compared to control (gelatin coating with 0% ZnO NPs). When applied to broiler chicken fillet stored in room temperature for 8 h, the gelatin–ZnO NPs 0.048% w/w bionanocomposite polymeric edible coating has the lowest weight loss rate of 17%, maintains hardness at around 80 N, stabilizes the pH of the coated chicken at 6, without any indication of rancidity or slime, with total microorganisms (4.23 log CFU mL−1) significantly below the limit set by Indonesian National Standard SNI 01–3924:2009 (5 log CFU mL−1).

The membranes were fabricated by phase inversion thin film casting technique, from PEI/acetone/NMP (n-methyl pyrollidone) dope solution, crosslinked with DAE 2.5 % v/v in methanol. The novelty of this study is that DAE has never been utilized to crosslink PEI NF membrane for removal of dye from textile wastewater. In this study, the parameters of composition of polyetherimide dope solution having acetone as non-solvent content are investigated to obtain a potential membrane for clarifying wastewater, which is one of major problems in Indonesia. A model dye was utilized, namely Reactive Red 120 (RR120) as a synthetic wastewater. It is found that the rejection of dye is increased along with the acetone content, and also by the crosslinking duration. The crosslinking between PEI and DAE is analyzed from the physical and chemical aspects, by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. A good performance in nanofiltration of RR120 synthetic dye wastewater is demonstrated with 92-98% dye rejection, which is quite reasonable compared to previous researches. This PEI-DAE NF is therefore promising not just for sustainable waste management, but also for the innovation and development in the ecology and environment of Indonesia. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","acetone; diaminobenzene; membrane; nanofiltration; polyetherimide","Acetone; Chemical analysis; Clarification; Crosslinking; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Membranes; Nanofiltration; Polyetherimides; Scanning electron microscopy; Textiles; Waste management; Water filtration; Chemical aspects; Cross-linking process; diaminobenzene; Reactive red 120; Sustainable waste management; Synthetic dye wastewaters; Synthetic waste water; Textile wastewater; Nanofiltration membranes",,,,"Indonesia Toray Science Foundation, ITSF","The authors would like to acknowledge Indonesia Toray Science Foundation for funding this study.","Sahinkaya, E., Uzal, N., Yetis, U., Dilek, F.B., (2008) Journal of Hazardous Materials, 153 (3), pp. 1142-1148; Alcaina-Miranda, M.I., Barredo-Damas, S., Bes-Pia, A., Iborra-Clar, M.I., Iborra-Clar, A., Mendoza-Roca, J.A., (2009) Desalination, 240 (1-3), pp. 290-297; Aouni, A., Fersi, C., Ali, M.B.S., Dhahbi, M., (2009) Journal of Hazardous Materials, 168 (2-3), pp. 868-874; Akbari, A., Remigy, J.C., Apte, P., (2002) Chem.

Raw milk also provides almost ideal media for various microorganisms to grow rapidly that can harm human digestion, or make damages the milk itself. In attempt to investigate an appropriate processing technology as an alternative of thermal pasteurization, we developed non thermal corona discharge to eliminate total number of various microorganisms in milk. The generated corona discharge used 7 pins to plate surface configuration. With a distance 15 mm between the electrodes, the applied voltage of 6.48 kV by a homemade high voltage AC power supply yields in corona discharge that has temperature lower than 30°C after 8 minutes operation. The time dependent effects of the implementation of this discharge to raw milk were carried out at time interval 2, 4 and 8 minutes.

As an emerging non thermal technology, cold plasma could be used to give a pretreatment to a thermal-sensitive material, such as pretreatment to seeds of bell pepper prior to be planted in soil to understand the effect of this dry process during the germination period. In this experiment, the used argon plasma was generated by flowing argon gas with the rate of 2 L/min through a positively charged of stainless pipe at a distance of 15 mm from aluminum plate electrode. With an applied voltage of 9.8 kV (peak-to-peak) electrical energy from a high voltage AC power supply, argon plasma irradiation was employed to the bell pepper seeds for a predetermined period of time as pretreatment to the seeds during pre-planting. It was found that the temperature of the plasma never exceeded 35°C during the plasma irradiation to assure that no thermal damage occurred to the seeds. It was also confirmed from this study that by giving non thermal plasma treatment for 30 minutes to the seeds may enhance the germination of the bell pepper plants up to 90% in stem length and almost 2.5 times in root length compared to the pepper without treatment. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","agriculture; green bell pepper; Non-thermal plasma; seed germination","Agriculture; Argon; Bells; Cultivation; Electric power systems; Irradiation; Plasma applications; Shotcreting; Argon plasma treatment; Bell peppers; Non-thermal plasma treatment; Non-thermal technology; Nonthermal plasma; Plasma irradiations; Seed germination; Thermal sensitive material; Seed",,,,,,"Lu, P., Cullen, P.J., Ostrikov, K., (2016) Cold Plasma in Food and Agriculture Fundamentals and Applications, pp. 83-116; Weizong, W., Danhua, M., Xin, T., Annemie, B., Gliding arc plasma for CO2 conversion: Better insights by a combined experimental and modelling approach (2017) Chemical Engineering Journal, 330, pp. 11-25; Zhang, S., Rousseau, A., Dufour, T., Promoting lentil germination and stem growth by plasma activated tap water, demineralized water and liquid fertilizer (2017) RSC Advances, 7 (50), pp. 31244-31251; Vlasta, S., Pavel, S., Jakub, K., Jan, P., Milan, S., Monika, S., Jana, J., Mirko, C., Atmospheric pressure plasma treatment of agricultural seeds of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) with effect on reduction of diseases and germination improvement (2017) Plasma Processes and Polymers, 15 (2); Je-Wook, K., Pradeep, P., Chulkyoon, M., Effect of corona discharge plasma jet on surface-borne microorganisms and sprouting of broccoli seeds (2016) Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 97 (1), pp. 128-134; Khanit, M., Non-thermal plasma for germination enhancement of radish seeds (2016) Procedia Computer Science, 86, pp. 132-135; Florian, J., Stephane, S., Christophe, B., Thierry, D., Plasma-activation of tap water using DBD for agronomy applications: Identification and quantification of long lifetime chemical species and production/consumption mechanisms (2018) Water Research, 133, pp. 47-59; Samarah, N.H., Wang, H., Welbaum, G.E., Pepper (Capsicum annuum) seed germination and vigour following nanochitin, chitosan or hydropriming treatments (2016) Seed Science and Technology, 44 (3), pp. 609-615; Waranyoo, K., Phirayot, K., Ponlawat, U., Improved germination and vigour of sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.)

Developing tools and techniques that aim to combat the loss of water quantity becomes a priority action due to it can provide actionable information to the community in its contribution to clean water conservation. In this study, the IoT-based water reduction system has been developed to measure water volume at three household appliances (washing machine, shower, and toilet) by installing flow sensors to those of each pipeline. Each sensor was connected to a microcontroller that sends water volume data and it will be stored in the cloud server. This technology could help users in reducing clean water consumption by: alarming user whenever water volume reaches 75, 85 and 95% of the limit volume for each showering session by installing a buzzer to the shower's pipeline; limiting the water used for the toilet flushing by installing a solenoid valve for the toilets' pipelines; and allowing users to access the information of all water consumption through Android-based mobile application. Through this study, IoT technology has great potential to support clean water reduction strategy due to it could save clean water up to 402 l monthly. Application of IoT technology can be started to be installed in such a small house or apartment in which the user can directly monitor their water consumption. © 2020 WULS - SGGW Press.

Therefore, we are of the opinion that the government must create new investment opportunities outside the stock exchange whose impacts can also be directly used for financing programs. In this study, we conducted an investigation of the interest of urban people to invest in online channels.

A homemade flyback transformer was utilized to power up this gas-phase plasma system and its electrical characteristics were presented in the form of voltage amperage waveforms. UV/Vis analysis was employed to monitor the influence of plasma treatment time on the decreasing of MB concentration as well as to measure the decoloration efficiency. It was found that the decoloration efficiency of MB solution can reach 93% after 120 minutes of plasma treatment to result in transparent water. Furthermore, FTIR analysis was performed to recognize the differences in MB organic functional groups before and after plasma treatment and to confirm the mineralization process that was occurred during plasma irradiation. During plasma irradiation, the interaction between hydroxyl radicals and other various reactive species transforms the organic pollutants into the harmless sediments through complex chemistry reactions.

Various combination of applied current, weld time and electrode force as the selected parameters whichhave three levels each, have been investigated to obtain the optimal condition of a welding process. In this work all experiments were carried out based on Taguchi experimental design of L9 orthogonal array. The values of spot weld tensile strength were decided as the response character to be optimized. Signal to noise ratio analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were also conducted to determine the main significant effect of those parameters and the contribution percentage of each parameter. It has been found that the current welding time plays the most important/significant factor in welding process to control the spot weld performance. The experimental results confirm the validity of robust design by Taguchi method for parameter optimization and possible increasing of efficiency in resistance spot welding processes. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The present study deals with the influence of variation of O2 gas admixing to the Ar plasma discharge to examine the decolorization of methylene blue solution underwater through measurement of absorbance value of the plasma-treated solution by UV/VIS measurement. From the experiments it was found that the best result of methylene blue solution decomposition was obtained from the application of Ar 0.3 lpm with the admixing of O2 gas 0.3 lpm in an underwater plasma system generated at 1.56 kV. Modelling the decomposition process of methylene blue by using Ar+O2 plasma with variation of O2 flow rate, it was found that the system was confirmed to follow the first order kinetics equation.

The plasma itself was generated by an in-house high voltage power supply (HVPS). Instead of gas-phase plasma system, we applied plasma jet system underwater during wastewater treatment without additional any chemicals (chemical-free processing). The method is thought to maximize the energy transfer and increase the efficient interaction between plasma and solution during the process. Our plasma jet system could proceed either by using helium (He), argon (Ar) and air as the medium in an open air atmosphere. Exploring the developed plasma to be applied in organic wastewater treatment, we demonstrated that the plasma jet could be generated underwater and yields in color degradation of methylene blue (MB) wastewater model. When using Ar gas as a medium, the color degradation of MB could be achieved within 90 minutes. Whereas, by using Ar with an admixing of oxygen (O2) gas, the similar result could be accomplished within 60 minutes. Additional O2 gas in the latter might produce more hydroxyl radicals and oxygen-based species which speed up the oxidative reaction with organic pollutants, and hence accelerate the process of color degradation. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","color degradation; non-thermal plasma; organic pollutant; wastewater treatment","Aromatic compounds; Color; Energy transfer; Indicators (chemical); Plasma jets; Pollution; Reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Color degradation; Efficient interaction; High voltage power supply; Hydroxyl radicals; Nonthermal plasma; Organic wastewater treatment; Oxidative reaction; Plasma jet system; Organic pollutants",,,,"0422/K3/KM/2017","The author would like to acknowledge the financial support from Indonesia Ministry of Research Technology and Higher Education through the Research Grant Number: 0422/K3/KM/2017.","Vineta, S., Silvana, Z., Sanja, R., Golomeova, S., Methods for Waste Waters Treatment in Textile Industry (2014) International Scientific Conference, 3, pp. 248-252; Abdelmalek, F., Ghezzar, M.R., Belhadj, M., Addou, A., Brisset, J.L., Bleaching and Degradation of Textile Dyes by Nonthemal Plasma Process at Atmospheric Pressure (2006) Industrial and Engineering Chemical Research, 45 (1), pp. 23-29; Tichonovas, M., Krugly, E., Racys, V., Hippler, R., Kauneliene, V., Stasuilaitiene, I., Martuzevicius, D., Degradation of various textile dyes as wastewater pollutants under dielectric barrier discharge plasma treatment (2013) Chemical Engineering Journal, 229, pp. 9-19; Kasih, T.P., Investigation of the Non-Thermal Plasma-Based Advanced Oxidation Process for Removal of Organic Contaminants in Azo Dyes Solution (2017) Journal of Ecological Engineering, 18 (2), pp. 1-6; Reddy, M.K., Bendi, R., Reddy, L., Challapalli, S., Degradation and mineralization of methylene blue by dielectric barrier dicharge non-rhermal plasma (2013) The Chemical Engineering Journal, 217, pp. 41-47; Ma, Y., Gong, X., He, B., Li, X., Cao, D., Li, J., Xiong, Q., Li, Q.H., (2017) On the Estimation of the Dissolved Hydroxyl Radicals in the Plasma-liquid System Using the Molecular Probe Method; Nehra, V., Kumar, A., Dwivedi, H.K., Atmospheric Non-Thermal Plasma Sources (2008) International Journal of Engineering, 2, pp. 53-68; Foster, J.E., Plasma-based water purification: Challenges and prospects for the future (2017) Physics of Plasma, 24 (5)","Kasih, T.P.; Industrial Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: tkasih@binus.edu","Kasih T.P.","","Institute of Physics Publishing","International Conference on Eco Engineering Development 2017, ICEED 2017","14 November 2017 through 15 November 2017",,133427,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

This happens because the cold plasma using the principle of generated reactive gases that have the ability to modify the surface properties of a material or product without changing the original characteristics of the material. The purpose of this study is to develop a cold plasma system that operates at atmospheric pressure and investigates the effect of cold plasma treatment to change the surface characteristics of the polymer material polyethylene (PE) at various time conditions. We are successfully developing a non-thermal plasma system that can operate at atmospheric pressure and can be run with Helium or Argon gas. The characteristics of plasma will be discussed from the view of its electrical property, plasma discharge regime andoperation temperature. Experiment results on plasma treatment on PE material shows the changes of surface properties of originally hydrophobic material PE becomes hydrophilic by only few seconds of plasma treatment and level of hydrophilicity become greater with increasing duration of plasma treatment. Confirmation of this is shown by the measurement of contact angle of droplets of water on the surface of PE are getting smaller. © 2017 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The plasma itself is generated based on point-to-point geometry under organic solution and can generate hydroxyl radicals, ozone, peroxide and other radicals as the basic species to destruct organic contaminants. Electrical diagnostic in a form of voltage and current waveform was investigated through the variation of time during the formation of plasma channeling. The evolutions of plasma channeling with its physical phenomena were also discussed. The relationship between the electrodes distance towards applied voltage to sustain the plasma were also studied. It was found that the mineralization occurred during plasma treatment to transform the harmful functional group in organic dye solution into harmless species. Simultaneously, the decoloration process by using this submerged plasma treatment system is able to change the orange color of methyl orange solution into clearly transparent water in 30 minutes. The present findings may provide the plasma-based advanced oxidation process as a promising chemical-free and cost competitive AOP process application on specially the waste water treatment in textile industry.","Dye decoloration; Organic waste treatment; Plasma-AOPs; Submerged plasma channels",,,,,,,"Al-Kdasi, A., Idris, A., Saed, K., Guan, C.-T., Treatment of textile wastewater by advance oxidation processes (2004) Global NEST Journal, 6 (3), pp. 222-230; Dojcinovic, B.P., Roglic, G.M., Obradovic, B.M., Kuraica, M.M., Tosti, T.B., Markovic, M.D., Manojlovic, D.D., Decolorization of Reactive Black 5 using a dielectric barrier discharge in the presence of inorganic salts (2012) Journal of the Serbian Chemical Society, 77 (4), pp. 535-548; Gerrity, D., Stanford, B.D., Trenholm, R.A., Snyder, S.A., An evaluation of a pilot-scale nonthermal plasma advanced oxidation process for trace organic compund degradation (2010) Water Research, 44 (2), pp. 1597-1610; Gunnar, R.S., Christopher, L.B., Dai, F., Thomas, M.H., Selma, M.T., Plasma-based water treatment: Conception and application of a new general principle for reactor design (2015) Chemical Engineering Journal, 273, pp. 543-550; Jiang, B., Zheng, J., Liu, Q., Wu, M., Degradation of azo dye using non-thermal plasma advanced oxidation process in a circulatory airtight reactor system (2012) Chemical Engineering Journal, 204-206, pp. 32-39; Kartohardjono, S., Handayani, P.L., Deflin, S., Nuraeni, Y., Bismo, S., Ammonia removal from wastewater through combination of absorption process in the membrane contactor and advance oxydation process in hybride plasma-ozone reactor (2012) Journal of Environmental Science and Engineering, A1, pp. 1101-1107; Nandini, R., Vishalakshi, B., A study of interaction of methyl orange with some polycations (2012) E-Journal of Chemistry, 9 (1), pp. 1-14; Pekárek, S., Non-thermal plasma ozone generation (2003) Acta Polytechnica, 43 (6), pp. 47-51; Ruma Habib, M.A., Hosseini, S.H.R., Sakugawa, T., Akiyama, H., Treatment of wastewater by underwater discharge in gas bubbling water (2015) International Journal of Renewable Energy and Environmental Engineering, 3 (3), pp. 189-194; Shimizu, K., Masamura, N., Blajan, M., Water purification by using microplasma treatment (2013) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 441, pp. 1-7; Tingting, S., Chengcheng, J., Chen, W., Jing, S., Xikui, W., Xiaoming, L., A TiO2 modified abiotic-biotic process for the degradation of the azo dye methyl orange (2015) RSC Advances, 5, pp. 58704-58712; Xin, L., Huimin, Z., Dandan, Q., Yang, Y., Ying, K., Fang, Z., Zucheng, W., Radical-initiated decoloration of methylene blue in a gas-liquid multiphase system via DC corona plasma (2015) Plasma Chemistry and Plasma Processing, 35, pp. 321-327","Kasih, T.P.; Department of Industrial Engineering, Jl.

The results of the study show that the effect of pretreatment time, the important of cerium concentration and the role of the reaction time are significantly affect the graft yield of MMA monomer onto kenaf fiber in a positive trend. This graft polymerization technique was intended to be used to alter hydrophilic feature of natural kenaf fiber in order to increase the compatibility with the polymer matrix material. In order to examine the applicability of the grafted kenaf as the reinforcement of composite material, the grafted kenaf with graft yield of ca. 160% was prepared in a large-scale experiment. The grafted kenaf fiber and PMMA powder were dry-blended so the mixture contains 60 wt% PMMA in total composition and have molded into composite plates by hot-pressing method. The composite plate with using untreated kenaf fiber was also prepared for the comparison. The essential characteristic of the composites such as mechanical properties and water absorbency were evaluated. Confirmation of the improved interfacial adhesion between the fiber and the matrix was also discussed. From these results, it could be concluded that the modification of natural kenaf fiber by graft polymerization method can effectively improve the poor adhesion between PMMA matrix and kenaf fiber and provide better characteristics of the natural fiber based composite material. © Research India Publications.","Graft polymerization; Kenaf composite; Mechanical properties; Natural kenaf fiber",,,,,,,"Alireza, K., Majid, K., Abasali, N.S., Ahmad, S., Studies on chemical properties and morphological characteristics of Iranian cultivated kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.): A potential source of fibrous raw material for paper industry in Iran (2012) Res.

The chemical structure and composition of the films obtained were examined by FT-IR and XPS analyses. It was found that, when raising the concentration of vaporized monomer to a certain level into the plasma, the plasma transitioned from a filamentary to a glow-like discharge, this resulting in a high retention of the monomer structure. Since the optical emission spectroscopy (OES) study of the plasma did not show any new excited species formed at higher concentrations of the monomer, it is clear that the fragmentation degree of the monomer in the plasma phase was quite low. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This system is used to deposit silicon dioxide films from a hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) precursor diluted in an oxygen carrier gas. It is concluded that, in terms of both quality and deposition rate at the same applied power, frequency, and gas composition, Ar plasma is more powerful than He plasma for depositing SiO 2-like films. The maximum feed rate of HMDSO/O2 injected into the Ar plasma torch is limited to 100 mL min-1 to ensure inorganic coatings are deposited. In order to improve the visual quality, without adversely affecting the inorganic features of the film, a small amount of nitrogen (N2) can be added to the Ar as a working gas. When the ratio of Ar to N2 in the flow gas is 30:1, the discharge behavior is transformed from filamentary to glowlike as a result of the quenching effect of admixed N2 on Ar plasma. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

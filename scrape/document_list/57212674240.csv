This study uses quantitative descriptive methods, with multiple linear regression analysis with SPSS. Hypothesis testing uses the F-test with a significance of α = 0.05. Data used annually for the period 2011-2019 are sourced from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) and Bank Indonesia (BI). This study found that simultaneously the US-China trade war significantly affected the growth of the world economy and Indonesia. The end of this study concluded that the US-China trade war had an impact on the economic growth of the US, China, the World and Indonesia. The implication is that the government needs to encourage exports to be greater than imports so that the impact of the trade war will be implemented positively for the Indonesian economy. Therefore, the US-China trade war needs to be stopped so that it does not have an impact on the economic recession in the future. © 2019 by Advance Scientific Research.","Economic Growth; Trade Balance; Trade War",,,,,"Binus University","We Thank Mrs. Enggal (Binus University) for the contribution to data analysis, and also thank Mr. Ariusmar (Binus University) for technical writing and language.","Nazarudin, M., Mulyani, S., Protectionism and trade war threatens the global economy (2019) Director General of the WTO [World Trade Organization) on the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC), , Jakarta; Morrison, W.M., China-U.S: Trade issues (2018) Congressional Research Service, , July 6; Li, C., He, C., Lin, C., Economic impacts of the possible China-US trade war (2018) Emerging Markets Finance and Trade, 54, pp. 1557-1577; Pewrang Dagang Memanas, Berapa Defisit Peradagangan Amerika dengan Tiongkok (2018) D Katadata, , US Cencus.gov co.id, 24/9 13.51 WIB; (2018) Welcome to the United States Vs.

The method in this study uses the adoption of the Knowledge Management System Life Cycle (KMSLC) life cycle. Where the stages used consist of Evaluation of Existing Infrastructure Analysis, Capture Knowledge, Implementing the KM system, Evaluation. The steps taken are system analysis, knowledge mapping in the application, implementation results and evaluation using usability. The questionnaire was conducted on 20 respondents, including 10 students and 10 Pamulang University lecturers. The questionnaire was conducted in 3 categories namely effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction with 10 questions each so that there were 60 questions and 3 linkers namely 4 if they all agreed, 2 if they did not know and 0 did not agree. The results of the SUMI questionnaire against the Library are 90; 75; 75; 87.5; 90; 75. The usability evaluation results are above average, meaning that the usability in the UNPAM Library system is already in the good category. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,"Binus University","The authors thank the Pamulang University and The Bina Nusantara University.","De, H., Making a Website Based Library Information System at State Junior High School 1 Donorojo, Pacitan Regency (2014) Indonesian Journal on Networking and Security, 3, pp. 2354-6654; Fatmawati, E., Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to Analyze Acceptance of Library Information System (2015) Jurnal Iqra, 9; Hamidah, (2013); Roberto, C., Emilio, E., Using Knowledge Management System: A Taxonomy of SME strategis (2017) International Journal of Information Management, 37 (1), pp. 1551-1562; Karto, I., Muhammad Ikhwan, J., Raymodus, K., Harjanto, P., Current Issue on Knowledge Management System for future Research: A Systematic Literature Riview.

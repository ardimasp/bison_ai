This article is valuable to extend the comprehension and knowledge of SME’s entrepreneurship to obtain innovation performance through digital business strategies and these efforts are encouraged by effectuation decision-making logic. This survey targets the manufacturing of small and medium-scale food and beverage SMEs in Indonesia. A total of 52 SME entrepreneurs were selected as the respondent in this research. The data obtained from the collecting of the online questionnaires were analyzed using Moderating Regression Analysis with SPSS for data analysis. The successful entrepreneurial SMEs enhance their innovation performance by improving managerial-operational capability. Effectuation decision-making logic contributes more to strengthening the relationship between managerial capability with innovation performance than operational capability with innovation performance. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Effectuation; Innovation Performance; Managerial Capability; Operational Capability",,,,,,,"Agostini, L., Nosella, A., Filippini, R., Towards an integrated view of the ambidextrous organization: A second-order factor model (2016) Creativity and Innovation Management, 25 (1), pp. 129-141; Agostini, L., Nosella, A., Filippini, R., Does intellectual capital allow improving innovation performance?

Informativeness plays a key role in online shopping decisions. Potential customers usually collect useful information and do a comparison before considering the purchase. Electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) is considered a reliable source of information. Customer reviews and influencer reviews can be considered eWOM. They represent customers’ sharing of experience and evaluation of a product or service with other potential shoppers. There is abundant evidence concerning the influence of eWOM on purchase intention. However, there are few studies on influencer reviews and purchase intention. This study aims to investigate the impact of customer review and influencer review to purchase intention and the mediating role of trust to those relationship. A quantitative experimental study (2 × 1) was conducted. Two hundred respondents from three cities in Greater Jakarta were divided into two groups to self-rate their opinion on customer review, influencer review, trust and purchase intention. Data collected was analysed PLS using SmartPLS. The study results showed that influencer review has a positive impact on purchase intention. On the other hand, customer review failed to show its influence. Trust as a moderating variable was also not validated in this study. © 2020","Business management; Customer review; Digital media; Influencer; Marketing; Purchase intention; Social media; Technology adoption; Trust",,,,,"Binus University","D.D.

The quantitative study was conducted with convenience sampling to 54 respondents (92% return rate). The questionnaire included items to measure the attitude toward generosity, intention to participate in the CRM program and positive emotion. All data were analyzed using SmartPLS. The finding of the study is that there is a significant positive relationship between generosity to positive emotion and a significant positive relationship between positive emotion and intention to participate in the CRM program. However, the direct relationship between attitude and generosity to the intention to participate in the CRM program is not significant. This study has both theoretical and practical implications. The contribution to theoretical is that this study gives empirical evidence of the relationship between generosity and intention. The practical implication is that this study can give insight to the manager on how to use CRM to improve company relationships with customers. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

Customers are viewed as the object of firms' organizational activities to provide benefits for the company. The researcher broadens this view into a bigger perspective, where the customers are now not only becoming the objects, but also the subjects of the organizational activities. The purchase intention must move on to the next level where all actors in organizational activities are taking charge in delivering purchase intention. Human-to-human interaction has become so important in organizational activities that firms must articulate on these factors to complement the existing factors, especially during the Industry 4.0. This research uses a quantitative analysis with 91 respondents aged between 18 to 55 years old with income. The data analysis uses SPSS AMOS. The findings correlate with the newest Consumer Trend Report for 2020 and more that in the future, social interaction between humans takes a great deal in making purchase decisions, known as consumer conformity. Innovations must be done by gaining consumer insights and increasing social roles to the advantages of the firms through social comparison, image related concerns and strategic complements. This research has several limitations.

The influence of information technology (IT) also has impacted the way firms do business, not only improving process efficiency, but also data analyses, decision-making, customer acquisition and retention which lead to the improvement of organization sustainability. However, the implementation of new technology is not easy. Various studies have shown failure in the technology implementation. Based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the quality of the system, which consists of perceived usefulness (POU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU), has been understood to influence customer satisfaction. However, there are still few studies that link system quality and customer loyalty. This study aimed to see the influence of system quality on customer loyalty. Using a descriptive quantitative method, this study was conducted on BPJS Kesehatan (Universal Health Coverage Program in Indonesia) members at 19 public and private hospitals in nine cities in Java, Indonesia. A six-point Likert scale questionnaire was designed and distributed. Four hundred and six samples collected were eligible for analysis using descriptive analysis and structural equation modelling with LISREL. The results show there is a positive relationship between system quality and customer loyalty. This study strengthens the body of evidence which showed the influence of POU and PEOU on customer loyalty. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Customer loyalty; Perceived ease of use; Perceived of usefulness; TAM",,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., Attitude-Behavior Relations: A Theoretical Analysis and Review of Empirical Research (1977) Psychological Bulletin, 84 (5), pp. 888-918. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.84.5.888; Calisir, F., Altin Gumussoy, C., Bayraktaroglu, A.E., Karaali, D., Predicting the intention to use a web-based learning system: Perceived content quality, anxiety, perceived system quality, image, and the technology acceptance model (2014) Human Factors and Ergonomics In Manufacturing, 24 (5), pp. 515-531. , https://doi.org/10.1002/hfm.20548; Calisir, F., Gumussoy, C.A., Bayraktaroglu, A.E., Karaali, D., Predicting the Intention to Use a Web-Based Learning System: Perceived Content Quality, Anxiety, Perceived System Quality, Image, and the Technology Acceptance Model Fethi (2014) Human Factors and Ergonomics In Manufacturing & Service Industries, 24 (5), pp. 515-531. , https://doi.org/10.1002/hfm; Davis, F.D., Bagozzi, R.P., Warshaw, P.R., User Acceptance of Computer Technology: A Comparison of Two Theoretical Models (1989) Management Science, 35 (8), pp. 982-1003. , https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.35.8.982; Hsu, L.-C., Influence of Quality of Information System Success (ISS) on Customer Intention to Continue Use in B2B E-commerce: A Contingency Approach of System Anxiety (2014) Research Journal of Business Management, 8, pp. 353-366. , https://doi.org/10.3923/rjbm.2014.353.366; Kim, J., Jin, B., Swinney, J.L., The role of etail quality, e-satisfaction and e-trust in online loyalty development process development process (2009) Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 16, pp. 239-247. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretconser.2008.11.019; Kim, M., Vogt, C.A., Knutson, B.J., Relationship among Customer Sayisfaction (2015) Delight and Loyalty In the Hospitality Industry, 39 (2), pp. 170-197. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1096348012471376; Lee, D., Moon, J., Jin, Y., Yi, M.Y., Information & Management Antecedents and consequences of mobile phone usability: Linking simplicity and interactivity to satisfaction, trust, and brand loyalty (2015) Information & Management, 52 (3), pp. 295-304. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.im.2014.12.001; Liaw, S.S., Investigating students' perceived satisfaction, behavioral intention, and effectiveness of e-learning: A case study of the Blackboard system (2008) Computers and Education, 51 (2), pp. 864-873. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2007.09.005; Lovelock, C., Wirtz, J., Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy (2011) Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy, , https://doi.org/10.1044/1059-0889(2011/10-0028; Navimipour, N.J., Soltani, Z., (2016) The Impact of Cost, Technoloy Acceptance and Employees' Satisfaction On the Effectiveness of the Electronic Customer Relationship Management System, 55. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2015.10.036; Oliver, R.L., (2015) Satisfaction a Behavioral Perspective On Consumer, , 2nd ed.).

Unlike any other crisis, this crisis catches everyone by surprise; no one has a full understanding of the situation; it impacts everyone worldwide on a large scale; and, it lasts months and changes almost every aspect of people's life. For the organization, major disruption can threaten business continuity. How an organization reacts to crises is critical. Leaders play a key role in crisis management. However, not all types of leadership are the best suit for a crisis. Transformational leadership has been claimed to be effective in turbulent and uncertain environments. However, the effectiveness of transformational leadership in a crisis is still inconsistent. Moreover, there are still limited studies on leadership roles in the crisis. The quality of communication is also important in crisis management. This study aims to fill the gap in the role of transformational leadership in crisis. This study also aims to see the influence of communication to perceived organization effectiveness during crisis and employee engagement and retention. A descriptive quantitative study was conducted in May 2020 with 252 respondents from the various organizations in Indonesia using structured questionnaires as the instruments. SEM – LISREL was used for data analysis. The finding showed that transformational leadership, communication quality, and employee engagement significantly had an impact on perceived organizational effectiveness during the crisis. Transformational leadership and communication quality positively influenced employee engagement. There was also a positive influence on employee engagement to employee retention. This study contributes to the literature on crisis management and transformational leadership. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

In many countries, the recommendation of health authorities forced the education sector to find an alternative of face-to-face session method. The distance learning method may be the best option for students in a forced situation. Even though e-learning is a hot topic, e-learning is still more of a supplement to education in normal conditions. This study wants to see the factors influencing e-learning satisfaction and performance to respondents who are forced to join e-learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive quantitative study using a structured questionnaire as the instrument was conducted to University Students at 4 campuses in Greater Jakarta, Indonesia. They were asked to self-rate the goal orientation, perceived ease of use, service quality, information quality, e-learning satisfaction, and perceived performance. One hundred fifty-three questionnaires were analyzed with SEM LISREL. The finding of the study shows that perceived ease of use (PEOU) and service quality have significant positive impacts on e-learning satisfaction, but not goal orientation and information quality. E-learning satisfaction positively influences to perceived performance. This study contributes to D&M IS Success Model and e-learning body of evidence. This study also contributes to e-learning practice. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Especially in Indonesia's telecommunications industry, there is a change in the use of telecommunications services with a greater need to provide innovative data services. This research aimed to investigate the relationship among transformational leadership, innovative work behavior, performance, and digital literacy (as a moderator of the relationship between innovative work behavior and performance). This illustrates how innovation in technology can serve as a core element to drive the competitiveness of a company, especially in high-tech industries. The role of innovation is becoming increasingly significant and can determine the survival and growth of a company. This study surveyed 230 managerial-level and above employees from three telecommunication companies in Indonesia. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed with LISREL to analyze the data in this quantitative research. The results showed that there was a significant and positive relationship between transformational leadership and innovative work behavior, innovative work behavior was also significantly and positively related to performance, and digital literacy significantly moderated the relationship between innovative work behavior and performance. © IJTech 2019.","Digital literacy; Innovative work behavior; Strategic management; Telecommunication industry; Transformational leadership",,,,,,,"Abstein, A., Heidenreich, S., Spieth, P., Innovative Work Behaviour: The Impact of Comprehensive HR System Perceptions and the Role of Work-life Conflict (2014) Industry and Innovation, 21, pp. 91-116; Ahmed, H.M.S., Hybrid E-learning Acceptance Model: Learner Perceptions (2010) Decision Sciences Journal of Innovative Education, 8 (2), pp. 313-346; (2019) Laporan Survei Penetrasi & Profil Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia, , 2018 (Penetration Survey Report & Indonesian Internet User Behavior Profile 2018); Avolio, B.J., Bass, B.M., Individual Consideration Viewed at Multiple Levels of Analysis: A Multi-level Framework for Examining the Diffusion of Transformational Leadership (1995) The Leadership Quarterly, 6 (2), pp. 199-218; Avolio, B.J., Bass, B.M., (2004) MLQ-Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, , Menlo Park, CA: Mind Garden; Bass, B.M., (1985) Leadership and Performance Beyond Expectations, , New York, NY: Free Press; Berawi, M.A., Stimulating Innovation and Creativity: The Way Forward (2017) International Journal of Technology, 8 (1), pp. 1-4; Chang, J., Bai, X., Juan, J., The Influence of Leadership on Product and Process Innovations in China: The Contingent Role of Knowledge Acquisition Capability (2015) Industrial Marketing Management, 50, pp. 18-29; Chen, J., Leung, W.S., Evans, K.P., Are Employee-friendly Workplaces Conducive to Innovation?

Customers’ decision on online purchase still is influenced by how confident they are in making purchase decision. Influencer endorsement is a hot concept in marketing; however, scholars argue there is only little evident on how influencer endorsement can improve performance. On the other hand, customer reviews are considered as effective in influencing customers’ decision. Where customers buy is also an interesting topic. Studies on B2C e-marketplace are still limited. This study aims to see young customers’ perception about influencer endorsement, customer review and e-tailing channel. A qualitative study was conducted to 55 respondents from Jakarta and Bogor. To further understand their opinions, interview was conducted to 10 of respondents. The finding of the study are young customers believe in customer review rather than influencer endorsement. They prefer to shop in e-marketplace compared to company owned website.

The sudden increase in demand will disrupt the delivery of service, especially in public hospitals, which will influence service satisfaction levels. A preliminary study shows that satisfaction levels of BPJS Kesehatan patients are still low. The most frequent reasons cited for dissatisfaction are fairness issues such as different treatments and different processes and procedures. Studies have found that aside from evaluations of quality, fairness is indeed an important factor that influences satisfaction. Yet there are limited empirical researches on the effect of service fairness on service delivery, especially in the healthcare industry. This study addresses the question of whether there are direct relationships between three variables of fairness and customer satisfaction. In other words, are there different levels of perceived service fairness in private and public hospitals and, if so, does this have an impact on customer satisfaction? Using a descriptive quantitative method, this study was conducted on BPJS Kesehatan members who used 19 public and private hospitals in nine cities in Java, Indonesia. A six-point Likert scale questionnaire was designed and distributed. Four hundred and six samples collected were eligible for analysis using descriptive analysis and structural equation modelling using LISREL. The results show that there is a positive impact of the three variables regarding service fairness on customer satisfaction in public and private hospitals. However, the relationship between distributive fairness and customer satisfaction is not significant in public hospitals. This study strengthens the building evidence that service fairness, in addition to service quality, influences customer satisfaction, specifically in service delivery in the healthcare industry. © BEIESP.","BPJS Kesehatan; Private Hospitals; Public Hospitals; Satisfaction",,,,,,,"Bredenkamp, C., Evans, T., Lagrada, L., Langenbrunner, J., Nachuk, S., Palu, T., Emerging challenges in implementing universal health coverage in Asia (2015) Soc Sci Med, 145, pp. 243-248; Thabrany, H., Raja Grafindo Persada (2016) Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional, 3, pp. 1-295; Dwidienawati, D., Abdinagoro, S.B., Does Generosity Influence Intention to Continue Paying Insurance Premium?

The harsh competition among English course providers and the existence of national plus and international schools have become challenges for the courses to attract students. We use both qualitative and quantitative methods to uncover and respond to the problems faced by this industry. We did interviews with some managers and utilized questionnaires of 61 English courses in DKI Jakarta. Using SMART-PLS (Partial Least Square), we found that the essential entrepreneurial factors of leadership, mindset and entrepreneurial culture as a whole were capable of generating and developing innovations within the English courses, which led to competitive advantages. However, we found an interesting fact that entrepreneurial culture had no direct significant effect on innovations. The novelty of this study is to contribute a new finding that the three elements of strategic entrepreneurship contributed differently to innovation in the context of emerging economies. © 2019 IJSTR.","English courses in DKI jakarta; Entrepreneurial culture; Entrepreneurial leadership; Entrepreneurial mindset; Innovation",,,,,,,"Al Mazrouei, H., Pech, R.J., The expatriate as company leader in the UAE: Cultural adaptation (2015) Journal of Business Strategy, 36 (1), pp. 33-40; Caesar, L.A.Y., Performance excellence by transformational leadership in developing collectivistic culture for Indonesian companies (2016) Pertanika J.

Specifically, IT has made significant and major changes in banking industry, especially on the way people do business with bank. Beside as business enabler, IT now become a major tool for bank to win the competition. With the strategic role of IT in banking industry, there is a risk from security point of view. The new sophisticated and advanced kind of attack drive to higher impact for banks. Beside direct loss caused by successful attack, there is also loss caused by image damage and sanction from regulatory. With many initiatives can be done to improve Information Security condition, banking need to prioritize the initiative that has most significant impact. Management support on information security is cited by many literatures as basic requirement for improving Information Security condition. Security Operation Center also proposed as initiatives to enhance the capability of detection and response to attack. This research tries to empirically find out the impact of Management Support to information security performance and the role of Security Operation Center on mediating both variables. Data are gathered from banks in Indonesia using survey methodology through questionnaire answered by qualified respondents. The sample design used is a probability sample with disproportionate stratified random sampling and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Square. This paper shows that management support has significant impact on improving Information Security condition in banking industry. It also concludes that SOC has complimentary mediation of relationship between management support and information security performance. Practically, result of this research can be foundation for company that wants to focus on factors that significantly impact security performance, while theoretically confirmed previous studies on the role of management support. © BEIESP.","Banking Industry; Information Security Performance; Management Support; Security Operation Center; SEM-PLS",,,,,,,"King, B., (2012) Bank 3.0: Why Banking is No Longer Somewhere You Go but Something You Do, , 1st ed.

The rapid expansion of health insurance coverage has created demand which cannot be met by current healthcare system and will disrupt the delivery service (Bredenkamp et al., 2015). The disruption of service, as a consequence, will influence the satisfaction. Patient satisfaction evaluation is important because it is not only as an important indicator to evaluate the achievement of the program but also it is important to improve treatment outcome. At present there is limited report on patients’ satisfaction to BPJS Kesehatan provider. This study is aiming to find out the satisfaction level of BPJS Kesehatan in Indonesia after 3 years of program implementation. This study using questionnaires as survey instruments. Aiming to BPJS Kesehatan midair that pays monthly payment insurance in six hospitals in five big cities in Indonesia. Three hundred and twenty-eight questionnaires are eligible to be analyzed. Decsriptive analyzed is done to evaluate the satisfaction rate. The result of the study shows that patients are satisfy with the interaction, support and services provided by BPJS Kesehatan patients, which is ninety-four per cent satisfaction. This study result is different with the pervious study which shows lower satisfaction rate. The explanation is that in this study majority of respondents come from private hospitals which known to have better service compares to public hospitals. To confirm the result of the study, further study which involved more balance public and private hospitals and big cities and small cities should be done to compare the satisfaction rate from each type of hospitals and cities. Further study to identify which variable of satisfactions are more influencing is also needed to identify are of improvement of BPJS Kesehatan services. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

The purpose of this research is to test the strategic performance measurement system (SPMS) framework through a quantitative approach and to assess the level of importance of variables in the SPMS framework by examining the effect of variables of organizational culture (OCL) on SPMS mediated by activity-based costing system (ABCS) and flexibility strategy (FLS), the effect of OCL on SPMS, the effect of ABCS on organizational performance (OPF), the effect of FLS on OPF and finally the effect of ABCS on OPF. The novelty of this research is to put the ABCS and FLS as mediating variables instead of independent variables as previous researches. The framework is hypothetic-deductive research. Primary data was collected through questionnaires. A number of 150 samples of the 250 questionnaires disseminated to both coal mine companies and mining contractors were collected and processed using SEM Lisrel version 8.7. The sample population was fairly distributed to coal mine organizations as unit of analysis. The results, using SEM Lisrel, OCL as an exogenous variable is positively related to both ABCS and FLS but does not affect SPMS directly. OCL is fully mediated by both ABCS and FLS. ABCS is positively related to both SPMS and OPF. FLS is positively related to SPMS but does not affect OPF directly.

Routines carried out by organizations may not be able to respond quickly to rapid technological changes, or often experience technical problems that require fast and creative solutions. This study, focused on the innovative work behavior on employee perspective (creative self-efficacy and transformational leadership) and tested the digital literacy role on moderating the relationship between innovative work and employee performance. This study was made based on the survey conducted at various telecommunication companies across Indonesia comprising of 235 participants with managerial level and above. Structural equation modeling (LISREL) was used for data analysis in this quantitative research. The result proved that there was a positive and significant relationship between creative self-efficacy, transformational leadership and innovative work behavior, innovative work behavior was positively related to performance, digital literacy gave significant moderating influences on the relationship between innovative work behavior and performance. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Creative Self-Efficacy; Digital Literacy; Innovative Work Behavior; Strategic Management; Telecommunication Industry; Transformational Leadership",,,,,,,"Avolio, B.J., Bass, B.M., Individual consideration viewed at multiple levels of analysis: A multi-level framework for examining the diffusion of transformational leadership (1995) The Leadership Quarterly, 6 (2), pp. 199-218; Avolio, B.J., Bass, B.M., (2004) MLQ—Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, p. 2004. , Menlo Park, CA: Mind Garden; Bass, B.M., (1985) Leadership and Performance beyond Expectations, , Collier Macmillan; Chang, J., Bai, X., Li, J.J., The influence of leadership on product and process innovations in China: The contingent role of knowledge acquisition capability (2015) Industrial Marketing Management, 50, pp. 18-29; Chen, M.H., Chang, Y.Y., Chang, Y.C., Exploring individual-work context fit in affecting employee creativity in technology-based companies (2015) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 98, pp. 1-12; Chiang, Y.H., Hsu, C.C., Hung, K.P., Core self-evaluation and workplace creativity (2014) Journal of Business Research, 67 (7), pp. 1405-1413; Choi, S.B., Kim, K., Ullah, S.E., Kang, S.W., How transformational leadership facilitates innovative behavior of Korean workers: Examining mediating and moderating processes (2016) Personnel Review, 45 (3), pp. 459-479; Craig, J.T., (2015) Antecedents of Individual Innovative Behavior: Examining Transformational Leadership, Creative Climate, Role Ambiguity, Risk Propensity, and Psychological Empowerment, , Alliant International University; de Jong, J., Den Hartog, D., Measuring innovative work behaviour (2010) Creativity and Innovation Management, 19 (1), pp. 23-36; Dörner, N., (2012) Innovative Work Behavior: The Roles of Employee Expectations and Effects on Job Performance, , [Doctoral Thesis, University of St. Gallen 120 ps.

The most mentioned reason for continued membership is helping others. Therefore, the preliminary study concludes that there might be a role of generosity influencing intention. This study aims to develop a conceptual model linking generosity to intention. The method used for critical review is PRISMA systematic review. The result of the critical review is used as the based for concept development. More than three hundred publications published after 2007 in Science Direct were screened with key words ""generosity"" and ""charity"". Finally, thirty journals were included in this review. The finding is that the most discussed topics are terminology (3 journals), motivation (16 journals), consequences (5 journals), and attributes of generosity (5 journals). Based on the review results, two possible relationships between generosity and intention are proposed. The first is that generosity, mediated by positive emotion, will influence intention. The second is that generosity has a direct influence on intention.

The growing presence of social media allows the opportunity for the branding and marketing of the non-profit organization with limited resources but demand high impact. Museum industry in Indonesia needs to preserve and communicate their culture to the public with limited financial and human resources. Social media was proven to solve this problem. The data was collected from a sample of 63 respondents using a questionnaire. The data were analyzed using descriptive analysis. The results were most of the social media users are in the productive age who have the minimum an undergraduate education, and most of them live in Java. They are not visiting the museum frequently, and their visiting purposes are to learn or study about Indonesia culture triggered by their school, relaxing, personal desires, and visit by accident. They know information about the museum from the search engine, offline, and social media. Most of the museum in Indonesia give bad experience to their visitor, and only some offer a positive experience. The limited social media users in Indonesia, who already aware of museum presence in social media, utilize it to get information about the museum (profile, exhibition, collection, and news), socializing with other social media members, and showing their existence in society. They suggest that museum management should update their social media frequently. This study examines the characteristics of Facebook Fan Page Museum user (age group, gender, residence location, and education level) and their behavior in using Facebook Fan Page Museum. Since there is no research in this field in Indonesia, the findings can be used by museum managers for managing their social media in marketing and education for the community. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Edutainment Marketing; Indonesia Museum; Museum Social Media; Online Visitor Behavior; Online Visitor Expectation",,,,,,,"Hassan, A.I., Crotti, R., El Hassan, G., Haddad, C., Jain, C., Le Quesne, K., Misrah, T., Segal, H., The Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2015 (2015) World Economic Forum; Isacsson, U., Facebook as an Edutainment Medium to Engage Students in Sustainability and Tourism (2011) J.

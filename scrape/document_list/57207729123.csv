This technology can be applied and used by the user to simplify everyday tasks. One task that user do in everyday life is doing presentation. In most lecturing and presentation sessions, many presentations will be involved by either the students, or lecturer and other people. One method that will be used to help the user is by implementing gyroscope sensors that available on most modern smartphone. This allows the user to navigate and point at any object on presentation slide without doing it manually or help from other tools such as laser pointer. The purpose of this research is to develop a smartphone app based on android to help user, primarily on presentations by using gyroscope sensor. © 2018 IEEE.","Android; Presentations; Sensors","Gyroscopes; Pattern recognition; Sensors; Smartphones; Android; Android smartphone; Gyroscope sensors; Laser pointer; Presentation slides; Presentations; Android (operating system)",,,,,"Phillipi, J.C., Th, W., Smartphones in nursing education (2011) US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health, , Aug; (2018), http://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share, Retrieved April 13, 2018, from statcounter.com; Brubacher, J.S., (1987) Modern Philosophy of Education, , New Delhi: Mc.

The results of this study provide a timely understanding of fish consumption behavior that will help developing countries create more effective and efficient fish consumption promotion campaigns. The complexity of the problem of fish menu adoption is mapped and a strategy for campaign programs is proposed. The consumer expression “it’s complicated” conveys multiple meanings, as discovered by the ethnographic study in this paper. The various barriers that appear at each stage of the consumer’s daily journey constitute a tier-based, hierarchical set of layered barriers. Hence, trying to solve this problem with a simple and superficial marketing communication strategy will not result in a significant increase in fish consumption. Some of the fish consumption adoption barriers found during the study are not completely new and some repeat the results of previous studies. This study also presents the discovery of certain variables that have not been previously discussed. We provide a tier-based adoption barrier model of in-home fish consumption to explain why fish consumption is not growing significantly in developing countries, despite the notable budget spent on marketing communication activities. © 2019, BIOFLUX SRL.

Customers perceived e-money as more troublesome compared to credit payment. They have different benchmarks about practicality. Therefore in any customer education, this relative advantage should highlight the practicality from a customer angle, not producer angle. Factors that significantly inhibit customers' use of e-money are the difficulty of balance checking and the impractical or ineffective procedure of credit recharging. Social influences are important to speed up the process of adoption, and this needs to be facilitated by many parties, not just natural viral communication.

Design/methodology/approach: This study begins with an ethnographic study to ascertain the determinant factors that motivate or hinder an individual from performing regular MCU. The study involved stakeholders in various health services providers, including patients and medical professionals. The quantitative part of this study focuses on “preventive” segment of consumers. A survey was conducted covering 303 respondents, consisting of two sub-segments of people labelled “healthy lifestyle” and “unhealthy lifestyle”. Findings: Consumer behaviour with regards to needs for MCU must be categorised not based on demographics, but their health status – preventive or curative. The “preventive” group was found to have differences in triggers and barriers between the healthy vs unhealthy lifestyle subgroups. For the “healthy lifestyle” subgroup, the determining factors for a regular MCU are the perceived benefit of action, social deviance, and cost perception. For the “unhealthy lifestyle” subgroup, the determining factors for a regular MCU are the social deviance, disease heritage, belief in traditional medicine, no urgency and cost perception. Research limitations/implications: The qualitative study part indicated the differences between two segments: preventive vs curative. The quantitative study part is only conducted in the preventive segment and not covering the curative segment. It would be interesting to see the differences between these two segments. Practical implications: Implication of study: to create contextual marketing communication in each stakeholders/segments – to reach the marketing objectives. Different segment has different issues to handle and need a different marketing communication programme. Originality/value: Previous studies have focused on analysing the differences in groups based on their demographics, which does not illustrate a homogenous need for an MCU. This study contributes by addressing that researchers must differentiate between “preventive” and “curative” groups. Additionally, the study of triggers and barriers has interestingly found that the determinant factors for healthy and unhealthy lifestyle are not the same. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Barriers; Consumer intention; Consumer segmentation; Ethnography; Medical checkup; Triggers",,,,,,,"Carpenter, C.J., A meta-analysis of the effectiveness of health belief model variables in predicting behavior (2010) Health Communication, 25 (8), pp. 661-669; Chandoko, C., Perceived behavioral control merupakan faktor dominan yang mempengaruhi minat menggunakan layanan medical check up (2013) Jurnal Aplikasi Manajemen, 11 (1), pp. 131-138; Creswell, J.W., (2013) Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches, , 4th ed., SAGE Publication, London; De la Cruz-Sánchez, E., Aguirre-Gómez, L., Health related lifestyle and preventive medical care of rural Spanish women compared to their urban counterparts (2014) Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health, 16 (4), pp. 712-718; DeVellis, R.F., (2017) Scale Development: Theory and Applications, , 4th ed., SAGE Publication; Eke, C.O., Eke, N.O., Joe-Ikechebelu, N.N., Okoye, S.C., Perception and practice of periodic medical checkup by traders in South East Nigeria (2012) Afrimedic Journal, 3 (2), pp. 24-29; Hair, F.J., Black, B., Babin, B., Anderson, R.E., Tatham, R.L., (2006) Multivariate Dana Analysis, , 6th ed., Pearson; Huang, H.-T., Kuo, Y.-M., Wang, S.-R., Wang, C.-F., Tsai, C.-H., Structural factors affecting health examination behavioral intention (2016) International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 13 (4), pp. 395-409; Janz, N.K., Becker, M.H., The health belief model: a decade later (1984) Health Education Behavior Journal, 11 (1), pp. 1-47; Kozinets, R.V., The field behind the screen: using netnography for marketing research in online communities (2002) Journal of Marketing Research, 39 (1), pp. 61-72; Lamb, C.W., Fair, J.F., McDaniel, C., (2003) Marketing, , Peking University Press, Beijing; Lee, Y.-S., Chiu, Y.-L., Liao, H.-L., Chen, J.-T., Lee, F.-C., Factors influencing the intention to utilize out-of-pocket health checkup services: a sample of citizens from 12 townships of Taichung County in Taiwan (2010) Journal of the Chinese Medical Association, 73 (5), pp. 252-259; Loewenthal, K.M., (2004) An Introduction to Psychological Tests and Scales, , 2nd ed., Psychology Press, Hove; McMorrow, S., Kenney, G.M., Goin, D., Determinants of receipt of recommended preventive services: implications for the Affordable Care Act (2014) American Journal of Public Health, 104 (14), pp. 2392-2399; Nakanishi, N., Tatara, K., Fujiwara, H., Do preventive health services reduce eventual demand for medical care?

Drawing on repurchase and continuance research, this study identifies four focal constructs: site commitment, satisfaction, social influences, and medium involvement, and clarifies the mediator versus moderator role of site commitment. Design/methodology/approach: Actual visitors to five B2B and B2C non-transactional web sites provide data participated in an online survey. The tests use the combined sample and then verify results for the individual sites. The test for mediation relies on structural path analysis; the test for moderation uses moderated regression analysis. Findings: The four focal constructs influence web site revisitation, though in most settings, only site commitment has a direct effect. Findings support the mediator role of site commitment, though some sites exhibit only partial mediation. Results are consistent across B2C and B2B contexts. The relative impact of social influences and medium involvement is less certain, and their impact varies across individual sites. Research limitations/implications: Because this study uses non-probability sampling to gather respondents, they may not represent all types of visitors to the sites. The non-transactional sites are primarily information sites, which restricts the findings. Research that considers other types of non-transactional sites, such as entertainment or global sites, could offer further insights, especially with regard to the impact of cultural differences. Originality/value: This research clarifies the role of site commitment by testing for mediation and moderation within the one study. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Commitment; Continuance; Mediation;

Study level/applicability: Postgraduate programs, Master in Strategic Marketing and Master in Business Administration. Case overview: One of the signs of an increase in religion awareness of Indonesian society is a high demand on Musholla in public area. While other shopping malls just provide a normal standard room for prayer, Senayan City has become a pioneer in introducing an excellent facility of a prayer room. In services marketing, one of the substantial matters to consider is physical evidence, or in other words service setting or servicescape. Musholla is one of the intangible aspects, which depicts services in shopping malls in Indonesia. There are three variables that distinguish visitors' types, such as time spent, liturgical compliance level and concerns for cleanliness/hygiene. Expected learning outcomes: The objective of this case study is to give deeper comprehension about services marketing to students in a practical way. This case study illustrates that a company is capable of creating a strong brand by acknowledging consumer needs and providing extra benefits. Besides, students are also required to analyze diverse consumer needs as each segment has its own needs. The use of ethnography as an approach shows that such a contemporary method can capture dynamic behaviours and deeper insight on consumer needs.

Design/methodology/approach The study, conducted a netnography which uses three qualitative research methods: online interviews; diary analysis; and observation of web site usage and behaviour. Seven respondents were obtained for the depth interviews, and 12 respondents participated in the diary study. The length of interviews was approximately 1.5 hours/respondent; whereas the three-consecutive days of diary entries consist of three-four pages per day/respondent. Observation was undertaken by the lead researcher as an active member of several user groups. Findings The emic perspective illuminated here shows that web site connectedness consists of three major themes: relatability; dependency; and sense of community. The paper defines these constructs, and suggests that to transform the relationship from “just friends” to “soul mates” web site owners should focus on improving one or all of the connectedness components. Surprisingly, frequency of visit did not determine the depth of the relationship between web sites and their visitors, as is the common assumption in the literature. Originality/value This research study illuminates a new way to understand the emotional connection between consumers and web sites, and uncovers the three most important factors that lead toward three varying levels of emotional connectedness (just friends, good acquaintances and soul mates). The paper also suggests ways in which emotional connectedness can be enhanced. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Consumer psychology; Internet; Worldwide web",,,,,,,"Aggarwal, P., The effects of brand relationship norms on consumer attitudes and behavior (2004) Journal of Consumer Research, 31 (3), pp. 87-101; Almquist, E., Roberts, K.J., A mindshare manifesto (2000) Mercer Management Journal, 12, pp. 9-20; Arnould, E., Price, L.L., River magic: extraordinary experience and the extended services encounter (1993) Journal of Consumer Research, 20 (1), pp. 24-95; Arnould, E.J., Wallendorf, M., Market-oriented ethnography: interpretation building and marketing strategy formulation (1994) Journal of Marketing Research, 31, pp. 484-504; Belk, R.W., Miller, D., Studies in the new consumer behaviour (1995) Acknowledging Consumption, pp. 58-95. , Routledge London; Belsky, J., The determinants of parenting: a process model (1984) Child development, 51 (1), pp. 83-96; Beyers, W., Goossens, L., Vansant, I., Moors, E., A structural model of autonomy in middle and late adolescence: connectedness, separation, detachment, and agency (2003) Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 32 (5), p. 351; Bornstein, R.F., The dependent personality: developmental, social, and clinical perspectives (1992) Psychological Bulletin, 112, pp. 3-23; Demers, E., Lev, B., A rude awakening: internet shakeout in 2000 (2001) Review of Accounting Studies, 6, pp. 331-359; Dholakia, R.R., Zhao, M., Dholakia, N., Fortin, D., Interactivity and revisits to web sites: a theoretical framework (2001) American Marketing Association.

Cloud computing offers several potential benefits that many e- governments over the world are trying to obtain by adopting cloud solutions into their architecture and public services. This paper focuses on designing GEA using TOGAF ADM based on the G-cloud model. The conceptual relationship between cloud computing in government agencies and information architecture is provided to provide a better picture in the implementation of GEA. A mapping model for G-cloud implementation is presented, as well as services provided by the G-Vendor cloud to describe the objectives and potential requirements for conceptualization processes. The proposed framework is expected to increase the success rate of e-government implementation in Indonesia, which has declined significantly over the last 8 years. However, that does not rule out the possibility of being implemented in other countries so that e-government can provide the promised benefits to their citizens. © 2019 IJSTR.","E-government; Enterprise architecture; Government cloud (g-cloud); Government enterprise architecture; Indonesia; TOGAF",,,,,,,"Setiawan, A., Yulianto, E., E-Government Interoperability and Integration Architecture Modeling Using TOGAF Framework Based On Service Oriented Architecture (2018) The Asian Journal of Technology Management, 11 (1), pp. 26-45; Saha, P., (2010) Enterprise architecture as platform for connected government: Understanding the impact of enterprise architecture on connected government, , National University of Singapore Institute of Systems Science; Budiardjo, E.K., Firmansyah, G., Hasibuan, Z.A., Weighted Components of i-Government Enterprise Architecture (2017) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 801 (1), p. 12025; Saiya, A.A., Arman, A.A., Indonesian Enterprise Architecture Framework: A Platform for Integrated and Connected Government (2018) 2018 International Conference on ICT for Smart Society (ICISS), pp. 1-6; (2016) United Nations E-Government Survey 2016: E-Government in Support of Sustainable Development, , United Nations; Firmansyah, G., Hasibuan, Z.A., Sucahyo, Y.G., Indonesia e-Government components: A principal component analysis approach (2014) 2014 International Conference on Information Technology Systems and Innovation (ICITSI), pp. 148-152; (2003) Presidential Directive No. 3/2003 about National Policy and Strategy for e-Government Development, , Indonesian Republic Cabinet Secretariat.

Integrating predictive analytics with automatic decision making, a bank can better understand the preference of its customers, identify customers with high spending potential, promote the right products to the right customers / cross selling, and improve customer experience, and drive revenue. One of Indonesia’s commercial bank is having an issue with cross selling activity of loan product, and seeks a big data analytics solution to help them. This paper aims to design paper aims to create a design of big data analytics application architecture, suitable business rule and model for cross selling analysis in the Bank. By leveraging Cloudera Hadoop, Aster Analytics as big data analytics engine, TeraData RDMS as their target storage for analytics result, and tableau for data visualization, also Talend data integrator for ETL engine we can perform cross selling analytics for several Bank loan products with a promising result, also design business rule and algorithm used for performing the analytics by using Propensity model using Random Forest and special tagging using SAX using bank specific threshold, and additional filter. Random forest algorithm is showing a good result measured by ROC / AUC. © 2019 IJSTR.","Bank; Big data analytics; Cross selling; Indonesia; Loan product",,,,,,"The authors wish to thank A, B, C.

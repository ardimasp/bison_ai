It is useful in the development of solving method of problems that are abstract and difficult to test and represent through common algebraic operations. Thus, an open source-based computer program was developed to evaluate and prove a mathematical group structure. Several groups that are able to be tested and proved are aperiodic group, periodic group, mixed group, factor group, and normal subgroups. The developed program results showed that the evaluation of several types of the groups mentioned above performed well and perfect with a relatively shorter time than the manual test. In this program, the Java programming language was used since it can run well on several different operating system platforms. Besides, it is also able to be published free, so that programmers or other researchers can develop the application program further by adding more useful features. © 2013 Ngarap Im.

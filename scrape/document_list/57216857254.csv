The research method used is Mixed Method, and the direct interview is used for data collecting method. Furthermore, The analysis methods that are used in this research are Cause and Effect Diagram Method as an analysis tool to identify the factors that cause delays, especially on the service industry. Critical Path Method (CPM) is used to identify which activities are included in Critical Path, which can shorten its duration by using Crashing Project with POM-QM as an analysis tool. The research resulted there are four factors that cause delays which are System, Skill, Supplier, Surrounding. The project can be completed within eighty-one days. The project can also be completed within seventy-eight days within the consideration of additional hours for an hour per day, and acceleration cost added. From the results of this study, the company will able to find out the causes of delays in the service industry that have an impact on project delays. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Turnaround time; Acceleration time; Analysis method; Cause-and-Effect diagram; Causes of delays; Critical path method; Data collecting; Project delays; research methods; Service industry",,,,,"Render, B., Stair, R.M., Hanna, M.E., Hale, T.S., (2017) Quantitative Analysis for Management 13e; Agyei, W., Project planning and scheduling using PERT and CPM techniques with linear programming: Case study (2015) International Journal of Scientific & Technology Research, 4, pp. 222-227; Nafkha, R., Wiliński, A., The critical path method in estimating project duration (2016) Information Systems in Management, 5, pp. 78-87; Zareei, S., Project scheduling for constructing biogas plant using critical path method (2018) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 81, pp. 756-759; Heizer, J., Render, B., Munson, C., (2017) Operations Management: Sustainability and Supply Chain Management 12e; Jacobs, F.R., Chase, R.B., (2018) Operations and Supply Management 15th Edition; Al Ghaithi, A.K., Kattiparuthi, R.A., Koya, A.M., Delay analysis in EPC projects using Ishikawa diagram (2017) International Journal of Advanced Engineering Management and Science, 3 (7), pp. 750-755; Górny, A., Identification of occupational accident causes by use the Ishikawa diagram and Pareto principles (2017) Economics & Management, 1, pp. 384-388; Doshi, J.A., Kamdar, J.D., Jani, S.Y., Chaudhary, S.J., Root Cause Analysis using Ishikawa diagram for reducing radiator rejection (2012) International Journal of Engineering Research and Applications, 2, pp. 684-689; Radziwill, N., Creating Ishikawa (Fishbone) Diagrams with R (2017) Software Quality Professional, 20, pp. 47-48; Reid, R.D., Sanders, N.R., (2013) Operations Management: An Integrated Approach 5th Edition; Kemenaker, (2004) Decree of the Minister of Manpower and Transmigration of the Republic of Indonesia Number KEP","Hamali, S.; Management Department, Jl.

Accordingly, employees of the IT industry that are symbolic of the ‘new India’ are seen as the aspirational new middle class, ‘different’ from the traditional working class. This article critically examines these claims. Firstly, it is argued that the development of the IT industry should be situated in the context of the larger development of capitalism in India. Secondly, through an analysis of narratives from interviews with workers during a period of industrial restructuring due to geopolitical concerns and technological change, the article attempts to understand workers’ perceptions of industrial dynamics as well as possibilities of collective resistance against the logic of capital. © 2020, Unified Theory of Information Research Group.

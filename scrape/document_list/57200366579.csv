Meatball quality including microbial growth, pH, aw, and sensory attributes was evaluated after immersed into nanocomposite solution for 1 min and drained. The combination of chitosan and ZnO NPs exhibited a synergistic effect in suppressing gram-negative bacterial growth. Chitosan-ZnO NPs 0.05% could prolong the shelf life of meatball beyond 24 hrs indicated by aerobic microbes of 4.30 log CFU/g which was lower than the threshold for consumption (5 log CFU/g). Coating solution also significantly influenced the pH of meatballs up to 24 hrs of storage allowing lower sensory acceptability. Moreover, the low organoleptic score for taste and overall acceptability attributes were found as a consequence of the addition of ZnO NPs. Finally, the results of the present study suggested that chitosan-based coating containing ZnO NPs could be used as an alternative to maintaining meatball quality, particularly in microbial decay context. © 2020, Rynnye Lyan Resources.

The aim of the present study was to test the effect of 4-week functional food ingredient feeding, alone or in combination, on the gut microbiota composition in diabetic rats. Methods: Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were treated for 4 weeks with (1) native taro starch, (2) modified taro-starch, (3) beet juice, (4) psicose, (5) the probiotic L. plantarum IS-10506, (6) native starch combined with beet juice, (7) native starch to which beet juice was adsorbed, (8) modified starch combined with beet juice or (9) modified starch to which beet juice was adsorbed, to modulate the composition of the gut microbiota. This composition was evaluated by sequencing the PCR amplified V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Results: The next-generation sequencing showed beneficial effects particularly of taro-starch feeding. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) related to health (e.g. correlating with low BMI, OTUs producing butyrate) were increased in relative abundance, while OTUs generally correlated with disease (e.g. Proteobacteria) were decreased by feeding taro-starch. Conclusion: The results of study show that a 4-week intervention with functional food ingredients, particularly taro-derived starch, leads to a more healthy gut microbiota in rats that were induced to be diabetic by induction with STZ. © 2020 The Author(s).","Diabetes model; Functional food; Gut microbiota; Obesity; Prebiotic; Taro-starch","food ingredient; probiotic agent; RNA 16S; starch; taro starch; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bacterium; beet juice; body mass; Christensenellaceae; Clostridium; controlled study; high throughput sequencing; Holdemania; intestine flora; Klebsiella; Lactobacillus plantarum; male; nonhuman; Oscillibacter; Peptostreptococcaceae; Phascolarctobacterium; plant juice; polymerase chain reaction; population abundance; Prevotellaceae; rat; Ruminococcaceae; Ruminococcus; Shigella; species composition; Sprague Dawley rat; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus",,"starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9",,,,,"Wild, S., Roglic, G., Green, A., Sicree, R., King, H., Global prevalence of diabetes: Estimates for the year 2000 and projections for 2030 (2004) Diabetes Care, 27 (5), pp. 1047-1053; (2015), https://news.un.org/en/story/2015/07/505352-un-projects-world-population-reach-85-billion-2030-driven-growth-developing, UN-News, Accessed 29 Mar 2020; Lynch, S.V., Pedersen, O., The human intestinal microbiome in health and disease (2016) N Engl J Med, 375 (24), pp. 2369-2379. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2sXhvVSnsQ%3D%3D; Shapiro, H., Suez, J., Elinav, E., Personalized microbiome-based approaches to metabolic syndrome management and prevention (2017) J Diabetes, 9 (3), pp. 226-236; Karlsson, F.H., Tremaroli, V., Nookaew, I., Bergstrom, G., Behre, C.J., Fagerberg, B., Gut metagenome in European women with normal, impaired and diabetic glucose control (2013) Nature, 498 (7452), pp. 99-103. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXotlGls7k%3D; Qin, J., Li, Y., Cai, Z., Li, S., Zhu, J., Zhang, F., A metagenome-wide association study of gut microbiota in type 2 diabetes (2012) Nature, 490 (7418), pp. 55-60. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38XhsVaqt7fJ; Onwueme, I.C., (1978) The Tropical Tuber Crops - Yams, Cassava, Sweet Potato and Cocoyams, , Wiley Chichester; Asha, D.A., Genetic diversity analysis in taro using molecular markers - An overview (2012) J Root Crops, 38 (1), pp. 15-25; Solossa, A.H., Sastrahidayat, I.R., Hakim, L., Home gardens of the local community surrounding Lake Ayamaru, West Papua province, and its consequences for tourism development and lake conservation (2017) J Biodiv Environ Sci, 3 (3), pp. 1-11; Iskandar, J., Iskandar, B.S., Various plants of traditional rituals: Ethnobotanical research among the Baduy community (2017) Biosaintifika J Biol Biol Educ, 9 (1), pp. 114-125; Kreike, C.M., Van Eck, H.J., Lebot, V., Genetic diversity of taro, Colocasia esculenta (L.)

Five different concentrations of carrageenan (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10%) were preliminary assessed by using hedonic test to determine three of the most preferred samples which were sausage formulated with carrageenan 2, 6 and 8%. The results showed that different concentration of carrageenan altered texture attributes and overall liking of wood-ear mushroom sausage, with 2% carrageenan formulation as the most accepted sample.

In this work, a novel nanocomposite coating was developed as a possible method for maintaining the quality attributes of the samples. Chitosan and ZnO nanoparticles (ZnONP) were selected to inhibit microbial growth on fresh-cut papaya. The aims of this work were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and effect of nanocomposite coating made of chitosan combined with ZnONP on microbial growth of fresh-cut papaya stored for 12 days at 10°C. The preliminary work was conducted to select the best formulation exhibiting the greatest bacterial inhibition effect which was chitosan combined with 0.027% ZnONP (by weight of nanocomposite solution). The results revealed that the average diameter of ZnO was 611.30 nm with polydispersion index of 0.011 confirmed by particle size analyzer (PSA). All components were completely contained in nanocomposite analyzed by Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) for its microstructure and presence of ZnONP in the film. Selected nanocomposite application on fresh-cut papaya could suppress microbial growth significantly in comparison with uncoated papaya during storage time. Our study suggests that nanocomposite treatment provides a desirable method to maintain and improve fresh-cut papaya postharvest life. © 2019 The Authors.

The ultraturrax and high-pressure homogenizer were used to prepare 1.34±0.25 - 5.79±1.61 nm of nanoemulsion size which confirmed by particle size analyzer. The morphology observed by SEM that exhibited the oil globules were covered by chitosan. They were aggregated and rough droplets. Interactions among the materials were observed using FTIR which led to the presence of a new peak at 1736 cm-1. The coated strawberry by high-pressure homogenizer-emulsion showed the best result suppressing microbial (2.41±0.01) and mould-yeast (2.78±0.10) growth at the end of storage compared to control which were 3.37±0.02 and 3.69±0.14 for microbial and mould-yeast count respectively. © 2019 The Authors.","Chitosan; Edible coating; Microbial; Nanoemulsion; Nutmeg seed oil; Strawberry","chitosan; emulsifying agent; nutmeg oil; antimicrobial activity; Article; cinnamon; controlled study; food coating; food quality; food storage; food texture; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; microbial adhesion; microbial growth; mold; morphology; nanoemulsion; nonhuman; particle size; physical chemistry; plate count; scanning electron microscopy; strawberry; yeast",,"chitosan, 9012-76-4; nutmeg oil, 8008-45-5","Malvern, United Kingdom; Gea, Italy; Thermo","015/KM/ PKM/2018","We thank the Ministry of Research, Technology Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia which provide the funding of this research through the grant of Student Creativity Program - Research 2018 (015/KM/ PKM/2018).",,"Aitboulahsen, M., Zantar, S., Laglaoui, A., Chairi, H., Arakrak, A., Bakkali, M., Zerrouk, M.H., Gelatin-based edible coating combined with Mentha pulegium essential oil as bioactive packaging for strawberries (2018) Journal of Food Quality, 5, pp. 1-7. , https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/8408915; Aulakh, J., Regmi, A., Post-harvest food losses estimation - Development of consistent methodology (2013) In Selected Poster Prepared for Presentation at the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association’s AAEA and CAES Joint Annual Meeting, , 4 - 6 August 2013.

During the distribution and storage, mango is potentially susceptible to both physical and biological deterioration. In this study, a coating method is applied to reduce quality loss of mango. Mango was coated by conventional carrageenan coating in combination with ZnO nanoparticles (0, 0.5, and 1% by weight of carrageenan) as filler. The results revealed that the elongation parameter of the carrageenan/ZnO nanoparticles (CZ) nanocomposite film are not significantly increase compared to that of carrageenan film, while the tensile strength increased and water vapor transmission rate decreased significantly. The incorporation of ZnO nanoparticles transformed the ordinary carrageenan coating to have antimicrobial properties against Escherichia coli as well. Finally, these qualities exhibited by the CZ 1 coatings could maintain the shelf life of fresh whole fruit of mango. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carrageenan; Coating; Mango; Nanocomposite; ZnO nanoparticles",,,,,,"We thank the financial support provided by Agro-Nanotechnology 2014/2015 consorcium project between Indonesian Agency for Agricultural Postharvest Research and Development cooperated with Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia .

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (ZnO-NP) and stearic acid on characteristics of cassava starch (CS)-based bionanocomposite edible films. The experiment had 3x2 factorial experiment design (ZnO-NP: 0, 1, 2% and stearic acid: 0, 30% by weight of CS). Glycerol and tween 80 were used as the plasticizer and emulsifier respectively. The results showed the incorporation of ZnO-NP increased the thickness, color difference (ΔE), tensile strength and decrease elongation, water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) and crystalline percentage. While the addition of stearic acid increased the thickness, ΔE and decreased tensile strength, elongation, WVTR, crystalline percentage compared to the cassava starch-based film. ZnO-NP was not observed clearly by using SEM and successfully trapped and coated by starch and stearic acid matrix. XRD showed an increase with the addition of 2% ZnO-NP in the polymers in the both cassava starch and cassava starch + stearic acid films. The C-H and C=O stretching was more intense for film with the addition of stearic acid compared to films without stearic acid by using FTIR. The improvement in mechanical and physical properties were achieved at CS + 2% ZnO-NP and CS + 2% ZnO -NP + 30% stearic acid respectively. © 2018 Universiti Putra Malaysia.","Bionanocomposite; Cassava starch; Edible film; Stearic acid; ZnO nanoparticles",,,,,"Ministry of Agriculture - Saskatchewan","This research was financially supported by the Indonesian Agency for Agricultural Research and Development, Ministry of Agriculture, through the Consortium Agro-Nanotechnology, Indonesia 2014-2015.",,"Abdou, E.S., Sorour, M.A., Preparation and characterization of starch/carrageenan edible films (2014) International Food Research Journal, 21 (1), pp. 189-193; Amini, A.M., Younes Zahedi Razavi, S.M.A., The influence of different plasticisers and fatty acids on functional properties of basil seed gum edible film (2015) International Journal of Food Science and Technology, 50 (5), pp. 1137-1143; Ariaii, P., Tavakolipour, H., Rezaei, M., Elhami Rad, A.H., Properties and antimicrobial activity of edible methylcellulose based film incorporated with Pimpinella affinis oil (2014) European Journal of Experimental Biology, 4 (1), pp. 670-676; Arora, A., Padua, G.W., Review: Nanocomposites in food packaging (2010) Journal of Food Science, 75, pp. 43-48; Asante-Pok, A., (2013) Analysis of incentives and disincentives for cassava in Nigeria, Technical notes series, , Rome: MAFAP, FAO; (1993) Standard test method for water vapor transmission rate through plastic film and sheeting using a modulated infrared sensor: D1249-90, , ASTM Annual book of American Standard Testing Methods.

Development of a bioindicator film is one of the alternative methods to detect sausage deterioration. The objectives of this paper were to develop a bioindicator edible films (BEF) from tapioca starch (TS), agar, and red cabbage juice (RC), and to evaluate its performance on sausage deterioration detection. The experiment had a 3x3 randomized factorial experimental design (agar: 3, 5, 7% by weight of TS; RC: 10, 15, 20% v/v based on 100% of suspension). Glycerol was used as the plasticizer. The results showed that the addition of agar into the film solution increased the thickness, elongation, and tensile strength, and decreased water vapour transmission rate (WVTR). While the addition of RC increased the thickness, but decreased elongation, tensile strength, and WVTR. BEF consisting of 2% tapioca starch, 7% (w/w) agar and 10 % (v/v) RC was chosen to apply on sausage.

In this study, generation of a new edible coating was chosen as an alternative method for preserving the quality attributes of fresh-cut mango. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of nanocomposite edible coating from cassava starch (SC), stearic acid (SA) and/or ZnO nanoparticles (NP-ZnO) on the quality of fresh-cut mango cv. Arumanis, stored for 12 days at 8°C. The formulations of 20 g/L SC, 6 g/L SA, and variable NP-ZnO (0, 1, 2% w/w of SC) were utilized to coat the fresh-cut mango. The result revealed that the treatment of nanocomposite edible coating was able to maintain the quality of fresh-cut mango during the storage periods. The SC, SA, and 2% NP-ZnO formulation was the most effective in reducing weight loss and microbial counts. Our study suggests that the application of nanocomposite edible coating provides a desirable method to maintain storage quality and to improve fresh-cut mango postharvest life. © 2019, Galati University Press.

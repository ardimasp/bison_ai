One of the most important factors of the bridge is the abutment. Abutment is a structure, built at the edge of the bridge. Abutment is designed to hold the weight of the bridge and over the bridge. The structure of abutment usually planted in to the river. One of methods to minimize the scour impact is considering the shape and design of abutment. This research aims to find out the effect of abutment model or shape variation (semi-circular end abutment, wing wall abutment and spill through abutment) toward the change of velocity using Flow-3D for numerical modeling, the physical test to validation the flow condition and analyze the characteristic sediment transport pattern using Hjulstörm curve. The result of research state that the spill through abutment is the most effective model to keep the stability of flow velocity around the abutment. Correlation between Froude Number (Fr) with Relative Longitudinal Distance Ratio is discussed in this paper. Then, Hjulstörm curve shows that with bed material diameter (d 50) of 0,54 mm, sediment transport in the entire abutment model located at erosion zone. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Abutment; Flow-3D; Hjulstrm curve; sediment transport; velocity","Failure (mechanical); Flow velocity; Scour; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Velocity; Bridge failures; Change of velocities; Flow velocity characteristics; FLOW-3D; Hjulstrm curve; Longitudinal distance; Sediment transport pattern; Shape variations; Abutments (bridge)",,,,"12/KM/PNT/2019, 039/VR

Yogyakarta has problems in water availability. The demand for water in Yogyakarta Province is gradually increasing with higher consumption for human consumption, industry, and agriculture and livestock production. Also, more inhabitants and farmers are utilizing groundwater for domestic purpose and irrigation due to long drought, respectively. This problem will be increasing as higher population leads to higher water consumption and food production. Therefore, this study aim to understand the current situation and long-term projections of water sources, and demands in 2017-2030 by using water balance concept. After that, the assessment of alternative scenarios to overcome water availability problem was performed using managed aquifer recharge concept and efficient irrigation. The result shows that within the period 2017-2030, water storage is negative in 3 (three) regencies. This means that water deficit had occurred in these regencies where water demand rate is higher than recharge rate of groundwater. Also, it might shows that most of storm water goes to surface runoff and/or most of groundwater abstraction for water demand becomes waste water production. According to the Scenario-1, recharging the aquifer with storm water, converting 45% of surface runoff to groundwater can reduce water deficit in only 2 regencies. Scenario-2 shows that converting 65%, can overcome all 3 regencies from water deficit. Combining aquifer recharge by storm water and effective irrigation can solve water deficit problem in all regencies by only converting 40% of surface runoff to groundwater. The study shows that both approaches of managed aquifer recharge and effective irrigation are applicable in Yogyakarta. In small scale, these applications can be low cost, but at larger scale, can require higher investment cost. Therefore a site-specific knowledge on the project field is very important. Large scale application will need more stakeholders and regulators involvement, and also social awareness and acceptance. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The purpose of assessing the leaching of nitrate in this study is to understand the transformation and transport process of N-source in topsoil that leads to nitrate contamination of groundwater. In order to calculate N-budget in the soil, the model was utilized to predict the nitrogen leaching. In this res earch, the N-budget model was modified to evaluate influence of precipitation and application pattern of fertilizer and manure compost. The result shows that at the time before the addition of manure compost and fertilizer, about 75% of fertilizer leach from topsoil. Every month, the average remaining nitrate in soil from fertilizer and manure compost are 22% and 50%, respectively. The accumulation of this monthly manure compost nitrate, which stored in soil, should be carefully monitored. It could become the potential source of nitrate leaching to groundwater in the future. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Fertilizer; N-Budget Model; Nitrate Available for Leaching","Budget control; Composting; Farms; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Leaching; Manures; Nitrates; Orchards; Soils; Field research; Groundwater nitrates; Nitrate contamination; Nitrate leaching; Nitrogen leaching; Potential sources; Small scale; Transport process; Fertilizers",,,,,,"Korsaeth, A., Eltun, R., Nitrogen mass balances in conventional, integrated and ecological cropping systems and the relationship between balance calculations and nitrogen runoff in an 8-year field experiment in Norway (2000) Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment, 79 (2-3), pp. 199-214; Sieling, K., Kage, H., N balance as an indicator of N leaching in an oil seed rape - Winter wheat - Winter barley rotation (2006) Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment, 115 (1-4), pp. 261-269; Ruijter, F.J., Boumans, L.J.M., Smit, A.L., Berg, M.V.D., Nitrate in upper groundwater on farms under tillage as affected by fertilizer use, soil type and groundwater table (2007) Nutrient Cycle Agroecosystem, 77 (2), pp. 155-167; Ju, X.T., Kou, C.L., Zhang, F.S., Christie, P., Nitrogen balance and groundwater nitrate contamination: Comparison among three intensive cropping systems on the North China Plain (2006) Environmental Pollution, 143 (1), pp. 117-125; Elmi, A.A., Madramootoo, C., Egeh, M., Liu, A., Hamel, C., Environmental and Agronomic Implications of Water Table and Nitrogen Fertilization Management (2002) Journal of Environmental Quality, 31 (6), pp. 1858-1867; Salo, T., Turtola, E., Nitrogen balance as an indicator of nitrogen leaching in Finland (2006) Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment, 113 (1-4), pp. 98-107; Ota, T., Use of Long-term soil monitoring Database for management of arable land in Japan (2010) Technical Bulletin of Food & Fertilizer Technology Center, , http://www.agnet.org/library/tb/179/; Akinnifesi, F.K., Mhango, J., Sileshi, G., Chilanga, T., Early growth and survival of three miombo woodland indigenous fruit tree species under fertilizer, manure and dry-season irrigation in southern Malawi (2008) Forest Ecology and Management, 255 (3-4), pp. 546-557; Agbede, T.M., Ojeniyi, S.O., Tillage and poultry manure effects on soil fertility and sorghum yield in southwestern Nigeria (2009) Soil and Tillage Research, 104 (1), pp. 74-81; Araújo, A.S.F., Santos, V.B., Monteiro, R.T.R., Responses of soil microbial biomass and activity for practices of organic and conventional farming systems in Piauí state, Brazil (2008) European Journal of Soil Biology, 44 (2), pp. 225-230; Wick, K., Heumesser, C., Schmid, E., Groundwater nitrate contamination: Factors and indicators (2012) Journal of Environmental Management, 111, pp. 178-186; Setyandito, O., Syafalni, S., Wijayanti, Y., Intan, C.D., Satriyo, S., Groundwater Quality Assessment and Recharge Well Design of Cengkareng Area, West Jakarta (2015) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 10, pp. 18337-18348. , ISSN 0973 - 4562; Birkinshaw, S.J., Ewen, J., Nitrogen transformation component for SHETRAN catchment nitrate transport modelling (2000) Journal of Hydrology, 230 (1-2), pp. 1-17; McLay, C.D.A., Dragten, R., Sparling, G., Selvarajah, N., Predicting groundwater nitrate concentrations in a region of mixed agricultural land use: A comparison of three approaches (2001) Environmental Pollution, 115 (2), pp. 191-204; Kleinman, P., Saporito, L.S., McGrath, J.M., Bryant, R.B., Phosphorus and Nitrogen Leaching before and after Tillage and Urea Application (2015) Journal of Environmental Quality, 44 (2), pp. 560-571; Garnier, P., Mary, B., Francois, L., Evaluation of a nitrogen Transport and Transformation Model in Bare Soil (2001) European Journal of Soil Science, 52 (2), pp. 253-268; Onsoy, Y.S., Harter, T., Ginn, T.R., Horwath, W.R., Spatial Variability and Transport of Nitrate in a Deep Alluvial Vadose Zone (2005) Vadose Zone Journal, 4 (1), pp. 41-54; Almasri, M.N., Kaluarachchi, J.J., Modeling nitrate contamination of groundwater in agricultural watersheds (2007) Journal of Hydrology, pp. 211-229; Wijayanti, Y., Nakamura, T., Nishida, K., Haramoto, E., Sakamoto, Y., Groundwater nitrate contamination in small agriculture area: Assessing the source and process using isotopes and ions (2012) Journal of Japan Society of Civil Engineering, 69, pp. I217-I222. , Ser.B1 (Hydraulic Engineering); Wijayanti, Y., Nakamura, T., Nishida, K., Haramoto, E., Sakamoto, Y., Seasonal differences and source estimation of groundwater nitrate contamination (2013) Journal of Water and Environment Technology, 11 (3), pp. 163-174; Yamanashi Prefecture Environment Conservation Agriculture Council Report, , www.maff.go.jp/kanto/seisan/nousan/daizu/other/kyourei_renraku.jtd, JA (Japan Agriculture), 201; www.jma.go.jp, JMA (Japan Meteorological Agency), data of Kofu Sta.

A reliable and complete datasets of urban storm inundation area in Indonesia should become its basis to give clear description of inundation area for formulating the best solution. In this study, Statistics Indonesia data in thirty three provinces were assessed during 2000 until 2012 providing data series of urban flood area, flood frequency and land cover changes. Drainage system condition in big cities should be well understood to ensure its infrastructure condition and performance. If inundation occurred, it can be concluded that there is drainage system problem. Inundation data is also important for drainage system design process in the future. The study result is provided estimation of urban storm inundation area based on calculation of Statistics Indonesia data. Moreover, this study is preceded by analyzing and reviewing the capacity of existing drainage channel, using case study of Mataram, West Nusa Tenggara. Rainfall data was obtained from three rainfall stations surround Mataram City. The storm water quantity was calculated using three different approaches as follows: 1) Rational Method; 2) Summation of existing inundation and surface run off discharge; 3) Discharge calculation from existing channel dimensions. After that, the result of these approaches was compared. The storm water quantity gap was concluded as quantity of inundation. The result shows that 36% of drainage channel in Brenyok Kanan River sub system could not accommodate the storm water runoff in this area, which causing inundation. The redesign of drainage channel using design discharge from Rational Method approach should be performed. Within area with the lowest level topography, a construction of detention or storage pond is essential to prevent inundation in this area. Furthermore, the benefits and drawbacks of the statistics database are discussed. Recommendations include utilizing more refined urban land use typologies that can better represent physical alteration of hydrological pathways. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Drainage Channel Capacity; Inundation; Statistics data Indonesia; Storm Water Quantity","Digital storage; Floods; Land use; Rain; Runoff; Storms; Systems analysis; Channel dimension; Discharge calculation; Drainage channels; Indonesia; Inundation; Land-cover change; Storm water runoff; Stormwaters; Drainage",,,,,,"Dewan, A.M., Yamaguchi, Y., Effect of Land Cover Changes on Flooding: Example from Greater Dhaka of Bangladesh (2008) International Journal of Geornformafrcs, 4; Merz, B., Hall, J., Disse, M., Schumann, A., Fluvial Flood Risk Management in A Changing World (2010) Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, 10 (3), pp. 509-527; Baldassare, B., Matteo, B., Giovanna, G., A Semiprobabilistic Approach for the Design of A Flood Control Reservoir (2010) Advances in Water Resources, 62, pp. 37-46; Ball, T., Hendry, S., Werritty, A., Spray, C.J., (2009) Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009, , (Sweet and Maxwell Statues Annotated); Basnayaka Amila, P., Sarukkalige, R., Werellagama, I., Numerical Modeling of Flood Vulnerability in Urban Catchments for Flood Forecastin (2011) International Journal of Environmental Science and Development, 2, pp. 383-388; Chen, A.S., Hsu, M.H., Chen, T.S., Chang, T.J., An Integrated Inundation Model for Highly Developed Urban Areas (2005) Water Science and Technology, 51, pp. 221-229; Yiping, G., Zhengji, Z., Analytical Probabilistic Flood Routing for Urban Stormwater Management Purposes (2008) Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, 35 (5), p. 487; Joong Gwang, L., Heaney James, P., Estimation of Urban Imperviousness and its Impacts on Storm Water Systems (2003) Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management, 129 (5), pp. 419-426; Akm Saiful, I., Sujit Kumar, B., Anisul, H., Flood Inundation Map of Bangladesh Using Modis Surface Reflectance Data (2009) Journal of Flood Risk Management, 3 (3), pp. 210-222; Zhang, J., Hori, T., Tatano, H., Norio, O., Chao, Z., Takuya, M., GIS and Flood Inundation Model-based Flood Risk Assessment in Urbanized Floodplain.

Overflow of Ciliwung River is one of rivers that causing floods in Jakarta. Katulampa Post/Weir is an early warning system of flooding occurrence in Ciliwung River before entering the city. The discharge at Katulampa weir measured by using manual or conventional system. This paper presented study result of frequency analysis of maximum dischargeat Katulampa Weir. The outcome will be utilized as the basis in the prediction of design-flood discharge for flood management plan. Flood often occurs in Ciliwung River which detected at Katulampa Weir. This study is preceded by analyzing the discharge and precipitation data using approach hydrology and statistics. Based on the calculated discharge by using rational method, correlation between the discharge at Katulampa Weir and upstream rainfall of Ciliwung River showed linear trendline. The study showed that Gumbel distribution is the best method in calculating design-flood discharge. Based on ratios among Katulampa Weir and Panus Bridge post Depok, Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) on Katulampa Weir has large error percentage compare to Panus bridge post Depok. Hence, conventional water level recording system in the Katulampa Weir is not effective to minimize the error in data recording. Design-flood discharge of 1078,62 m3/s; 1177,61 m3/s; and 1276,61 m3/s was obtained using maximum discharge analysis with 25, 50 and 100 years return periods and 10% risk level.

Land use change from open space area into settlements and business area has increased surface runoff that causing flooding. Also, activities in these areas had caused groundwater pollution and groundwater level declined. Groundwater recharge well is one of many methods to increase groundwater level by utilizing storm water infiltration. Thus, storm water that causing inundation could be converted to recharge the groundwater. This research was performed quality and quantity analysis to study existing groundwater condition. The hydrochemistry of groundwater in all sampling locations shows high NH4 ranging from 2.3 mg/L to 19.02 mg/L indicate groundwater contamination suspected originated from domestic/non domestic waste or septic tank leakage. Also, one of five sampling locations shows Na and EC value which exceeds the permissible limit that might due to salt intrusion. Regarding groundwaterlevel for Cengkareng area, the result shows that there is a significant groundwater level decline at ’deeper confined aquifer (>140)’ wells from 2005 to 2013. The groundwater level trend line shows that the groundwater level will continue to decrease in the future. There is no groundwater decline at ‘above confined aquifer (40-140 m)’ wells, but groundwater level is very low at around -58 m AMSL. This could be the result of intensive groundwater withdrawal that has been occurring years ago until now. Hence, groundwater recharge in this area is critical, in order to restore groundwater storage. Therefore, the artificial recharge of storm water, will work on reducing the groundwater pollutant and increasing the water level. Finally, the design of infiltration wells was completed using Sunjoto Formula and rainfall data of Cengkareng, with soil permeability of 14x10-6 m/s. © Research India Publications.","Cengkareng; Groundwater level; Hydrochemical characteristics; Recharge well",,,,,,,"Djaja, R., Rais, J., Zabidin, H., Wedyanto, K., (2004) Land Subsidence of Jakarta Metropolitan Area, , https://www.fig.net/pub/jakarta/papers/ts_06/ts_06_4_djaja_etal.pdf, Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia.

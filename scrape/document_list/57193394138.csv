This research used a sample of multinational companies listed in the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX) from the period of 2010 to 2012. The data analysis was based on the company's financial statements generated from the IDX. Transfer pricing aggressiveness was measured by TPRICE index, which consists of items that represent occurrences of non-arm's length transactions. Six determinants of transfer pricing aggressiveness were tested in this study, including firm size, profitability, leverage, intangible assets, multi-nationality and tax haven utilisation. To test the model, multiple regression analysis was applied. Based on the results, the authors discovered that firm size and leverage are positively associated with transfer pricing aggressiveness, while intangible assets and multi-nationality are negatively associated. This study also shows that profitability and tax haven utilisation are not related to transfer pricing aggressiveness. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Arm's length principle; Indonesia; Tax avoidance; Transfer pricing",,,,,,"Bebchuk, L., Cohen, A., Ferrell, A., What matters in corporate governance (2009) Review of Financial Studies, 22 (2), pp. 783-827; Bernard, A.B., Jensen, J.B., Schott, P.K., Transfer pricing by US-based multinational firms (2006) NBER Working Paper Series 12493, , http://www.nber.org/papers/w12493; Brown, L., Caylor, C., Corporate governance and firm valuation (2006) Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, 25 (4), pp. 409-434; Conover, T.L., Nichols, N.B., A further examination of income shifting through transfer pricing considering firm size and/or distress (2000) The International Journal of Accounting, 35 (2), pp. 189-211; (2009) Dormant Accounts, , http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/about/pdf/gba10.pdf, Department for Business Enterprise & Regulatory Reform; Desai, M., Dharmapala, D., Corporate tax avoidance and high powered incentives (2006) Journal of Financial Economics, 79, pp. 145-179; Desai, M., Dyck, A., Zingales, L., Theft and taxes (2007) Journal of Financial Economics, 84 (3), pp. 591-623; Dharmapala, D., What problems and opportunities are created by tax havens (2008) Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation, 24 (4), pp. 661-679; Duhigg, C., Kocieniewski, D., How Apple sidesteps billions in taxes (2012) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/business/apples-tax-strategy-aims-at-low-tax-states-and-nations.html?_r=0; Dyreng, S., Hanlon, M., Maydew, E., Long-run corporate tax avoidance (2008) The Accounting Review, 83 (1), pp. 61-82; (2011) Tracking Global Trend: How Six Key Developments Are Shaping the Business World, , http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Tracking_global_trends/$FILE/Tracking%20global%20trends.pdf; Gravelle, J., Tax havens: International tax avoidance and evasion.

The applications are not only as a hub between drivers to passengers but also as a hub for food and goods delivery services. Nowadays, motorbike taxi app-based is much closed to Jakarta citizen's daily activities. Based on those conditions, a number of motorbike taxi drivers in Jakarta can support a safe driving behavior among citizen. The promotion is part of a Government program in reducing traffic accidents. This study examines the association between workload (WL), emotional intelligence (EI), and fatigue (F) to certain driving behavior (ADB). The objective of the study tried to find out whether the current driving behavior of drivers relevant to support Government programs in reducing traffic accidents. A set of questionnaires with a Likert scale 1-5 was used as a research instrument. A sample of 201 app-based motorbike taxi drivers was involved. The participants answered a survey that includes an adapted version of a Driving behavior questionnaire (DBQ), the Prosocial and aggressive driving inventory (PADI), and a Driving activity load index (DALI). The result showed that drivers' driving behavior categorized into aggressive, with the level of workload, fatigue, and emotional intelligence are respectively low, moderate, and moderate to high. Utilizing Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), it was found that aggressive driving behavior could be predicted through EI. The fatigue (F) proved as mediating associations between WL and ADB, and between EI and ADB. Based on the result, the potential of the app-based motorbike taxi community to become a pioneer in safe driving behavior is quite good. They can help government in promoting safe driving behavior to the citizen. © 2020 IEEE.","Aggressive driving behavior; App-based motorbike driver; Emotional intelligence; Fatigue; Workload","Accidents; Emotional intelligence; Information management; Least squares approximations; Surveys; Aggressive driving; Aggressive driving behaviors; Driving behavior questionnaire; Government projects; Partial least square (PLS); Reducing traffic accidents; Research instruments; Structural equation modeling; Taxicabs",,,,,"Ady, W., Astuti, W., Manan, A., The relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty: Evidence on online transportation services in Indonesia (2019) Ijasre, 5, pp. 214-222; (2018) Land Transportation Statistics 2018, , https://www.bps.go.id/publication/2019/11/27/7fdd3379108b4a60e046f4c8/statistik-transportasi-darat-2018.html, Retrieved from; Fountas, G., Pantangi, S.S., Hulme, K.F., Anastasopoulos, P.C., The effects of driver fatigue, gender, and distracted driving on perceived and observed aggressive driving behavior: A correlated grouped random parameters bivariate probit approach (2019) Analytic Methods in Accident Research, 22, pp. 1-15; Haerani, S., Sudirman, I., Hakim, W., Adji, A.S., Parmitasari, R.A., Amin, N., Aunalal, Z.I., Mediation effect of driving behavior on personality influence toward driving outcomes in Indonesia (2017) International Journal of Human Rights in Heal; Sucha, M., Chernocova, D., Driver personality as a valid predictor of risky driving (2016) Transportation Research Procedia, 14, pp. 4286-4295; Hafizhudin, Z., Indrawati, E.S., The relationship between social identity and aggressive behavior of rx-king community in semarang (hubungan antara identitas sosial dengan perilaku mengemudi agresif pada komunitas motor rx-king di semarang) (2016) Jurnal Empati, 5, pp. 683-686; Rosydah, B.M., Kurniasih, D., San, R., The effect of individual characteristics and environment to the aggressive behavior of public transportation driver in surabaya (efek karakteristik individu dan pengaruh lingkungan terhadap perilaku aggressive driving pada pengemudi angkutan umum di kota surabaya) (2017) Seminar Mater PPNS, 2, pp. 15-18; Harris, B.P., Houston, M.J., Vazquez, J.A., Smither, J.A., Harms, A., The prosocial and aggressive driving inventory (padi): A self-report measure of safe and unsafe driving behaviors (2014) Accident Analysis & Prevention, 72, pp. 1-8; Harvey, C., Stanton, N.A., (2013) Usability Evaluation for In-Vehicle Systems, , U.

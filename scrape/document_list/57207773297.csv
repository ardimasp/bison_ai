This research aims to analyse the performance of an admixture to make concrete mix to be waterproofed. In this research, a Xypex C-1000 was used. It was claimed to have the ability to improve the compressive strength of concrete structures and to reduce the permeability of concrete structures. From this research, it was found that there was a reduction in compressive strength for the concrete samples at 28 days compared to the compressive strength of the concrete aged 7 days. The reduction was significant for the concrete samples with Xypex C-1000. However, for the concrete samples aged 7 days with Xypex C-1000, it was found that there was a reduction in permeability of concrete structures, but only at certain dosage. For the concrete samples aged 28 days, the permeability of the samples were all below the allowable limit. In conclusion, based on these preliminary results, it can be seen that the Xypex C-1000 is effective in reducing the permeability of the concrete structures, but it is important further study the effect that the Xypex C-1000 has on the compressive strength of concrete structures. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

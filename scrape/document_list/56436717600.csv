Although more and more studies on small businesses occur, but the key factors for companies to survive in a certain period of time – during the last three and a half years in this study, still need to be explored. Especially in Indonesia, small businesses as part of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are able to contribute 60.34% of national Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This research method belongs to the type of explanatory research. Determination of the first level sample uses purposive sampling, namely small businesses engaged in food and beverages, at least 3.5 years old. Based on the analysis it was concluded that the Service Innovation and Product variables had a positive effect on Operational Improvement, Service Innovation and Products had a positive effect on Survival SMEs, Operational Improvement had a positive effect on Survival, Financial Performance had a positive effect on Operational Improvement and Financial Performance had effect on Survival. © 2020 by the authors","MSMEs; Operational Improvement; Service Innovation and Products; Survival",,,,,,"Amit, R., Zott, C., Creating value through business model innovation (2012) MIT Sloan Management Review, 53 (3), pp. 41-49; Amit, R., Schoemaker, P.J., Strategic assets and organizational rent (1993) Strategic Management Journal, 14 (1), pp. 33-46; Baayen, R.H., Davidson, D.J., Bates, D.M., Mixed-effects modeling with crossed random effects for subjects and items (2008) Journal of Memory and Language, 59 (4), pp. 390-412; Barbosa, E., (2016) Determinants of Small Business Survival: The Case of Very Small Enterprises of the Traditional Manufacturing Sectors in Brazil, , SSRN 2802706; Barney, J.B., Mackey, A., Text and metatext in the resource‐based view (2016) Human Resource Management Journal, 26 (4), pp. 369-378; Barton, S.L., Matthews, C.H., Small firm financing: Implications from a strategic management perspective (1989) Journal of Small Business Management, 27 (1), p. 1; Borrego, M., Douglas, E.P., Amelink, C.T., Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed research methods in engineering education (2009) Journal of Engineering Education, 98 (1), pp. 53-66; Brophy, D.J., Shulman, J.M., A finance perspective on entrepreneurship research (1992) Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 16 (3), pp. 61-72; Chesbrough, H., Business model innovation: It's not just about technology anymore (2007) Strategy & Leadership, 35 (6), pp. 12-17; Chesbrough, H., (2010) Open Services Innovation: Rethinking Your Business to Grow and Compete in A New Era, , John Wiley & Sons; Chesbrough, H., Rosenbloom, R.S., The role of the business model in capturing value from innovation: Evidence from Xerox Corporation's technology spin‐off companies (2002) Industrial and Corporate Change, 11 (3), pp. 529-555; Christensen, C.M., McDonald, R., Altman, E.J., Palmer, J.E., Disruptive innovation: An intellectual history and directions for future research (2018) Journal of Management Studies, 55 (7), pp. 1043-1078; de Jesus Pacheco, D.A., Carla, S., Jung, C.F., Ribeiro, J.L.D., Navas, H.V.G., Cruz-Machado, V.A., Eco-innovation determinants in manufacturing SMEs: Systematic review and research directions (2017) Journal of Cleaner Production, 142, pp. 2277-2287; Droege, H., Hildebrand, D., Heras Forcada, M.A., Innovation in services: Present findings, and future pathways (2009) Journal of Service Management, 20 (2), pp. 131-155; Hillary, R., (2017) Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and the Environment: Business Imperatives, , Ed Routledge; Julien, P.A., (2018) The State of the Art in Small Business and Entrepreneurship, , Routledge; Kindström, D., Kowalkowski, C., Service innovation in product-centric firms: A multidimensional business model perspective (2014) Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing, 29 (2), pp. 96-111; Markides, C., Disruptive innovation: In need of better theory (2006) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 23 (1), pp. 19-25; Mjongwana, A., Kamala, P.N., Non-financial performance measurement by small and medium sized enterprises operating in the hotel industry in the city of Cape Town (2018) African Journal of Hospitality, Tourism and Leisure; Muller, P., Devnani, S., Julius, J., Gagliardi, D., Marzocchi, C., (2016) Annual Report on European SMEs 2015/2016–SME Recovery Continues, , Contract number: EASME/COSME/2015/012.

Unfortunately, many of these small businesses cannot survive for long. In Indonesia alone, a three and a half year survival rate is set by the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) (KUKM) for someone to be called an entrepreneur. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of financial performance and service and product innovation on the survival of small businesses mediated by TAM. The method of this research is a quantitative approach using SEM Lisrel. The sample of this research is food and beverage SMEs in Jabotabek by selecting purposive samples obtained from 200 respondents. The results of this study are based on the results of the analysis and discussion found that the variable Financial Performance proved to have a positive effect on Business Survival.

A field experiment was conducted in Jakarta to 240 respondents. The data was collected using 2×2×2 between subject factorial designs. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's Post Hoc test were employed to analyze the significant different between research variables. For parent brands: celebrity endorser credibility does not increase brand awareness, brand association but it increases perceived quality of brand with high credibility. Meanwhile, celebrity endorser credibility increases awareness but it does not increase brand association and perceived quality of brand with low credibility. For sub-brands: celebrity endorser credibility of sub-brand of highly credible brand only increases brand awareness of the sub-brand but it does not increase brand awareness, brand association and perceived quality of both sub-brands with high and low credibility. The role of celebrity endorser has important role in increasing awareness of brands with low credibility, so that celebrity endorser can be considered as effective marketing tools for new brand in the market.

A questionnaire-based survey was employed to collect data from 204 SME owners/managers. The results suggest that complexity, trialability, and observability are among the technological factors that have a significant influence on ICT adoption. Research advantage and compatibility do not influence ICT adoption. Meanwhile, organizational factors such as owner/manager knowledge and innovativeness significantly influence ICT adoption among SMEs. Environmental factors such as competitive pressure, institutional intervention (excepting market turbulence) contribute significantly to the adoption. Moreover, data analysis reveals that ICT adoption has a positive influence toward SMEs' marketing capabilities. Finally marketing capabilities significantly influence a firm's business performance. The findings contain valuable insights that could educate owners/managers of SMEs about the potential gains they will get by adopting the cost-effective capabilities of Internet adoption for their businesses. This study also provides justification and recommendations for government and lawmakers to foster the growth of SMEs in Indonesia by building more IT-related infrastructure and developing necessary skills to enhance SME business performance.","Business performance; Fashion industry; ICT; Indonesia; Marketing capabilities; Small to medium-sized enterprises",,,,,,"Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., Understanding attitudes and predicting social behavior (1980), Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes., 20, pp. 179-211; Al-Qirim, N., The adoption of e-commerce communications and applications technology in small businesses in New Zealand (2007) Electronic Commerce Research and Applications., 6 (4), pp. 462-473; Amit, R., Schoemaker, P.J.H., Strategic assets and organizational rent (1993) Strategic Management Journal., 14 (1), pp. 33-46; Antuahene-Gima, K., Haiyang, L., Marketing influence tactics in new product development: a study of high technology firms in China (2000) Journal of Product innovation Management, 17 (6), pp. 451-470; Ashrafi, R., Murtaza, M., Use and impact of ICT on SMEs in Oman (2008) The Electronic Journal Information Systems Evaluation., 11 (3), pp. 125-138; Bassellier, G., Benbasat, I., Reich, B., The influence of business managers' IT competence on championing IT (2003) Information Systems Research., 14 (4), pp. 317-336; Barney, J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management., 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Beckinsale, M., Ram, M., Delivering ICT to ethnic minority businesses: an actionresearch approach (2006) Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy., 24 (6), pp. 847-867; Statistik Industrikecil: Small-Scale manufacturing Industry Statistics (2010), Jakarta: Biro PusatStatistik; Brady, M., Saren, M., Tzokas, N., Integrating information technology into marketing practice - the IT reality of contemporary marketing practice (2002) Journal of Marketing Management., 18, pp. 55-77; Brodie, R.J., Winklhofer, H., Coviello, N.E., Johnston, W.J., Is e- marketing coming of age?

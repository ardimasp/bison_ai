This insurance market is often characterized by incomplete information on both market sides, which could result moral hazard behavior. The intermediaries’ system attempts to cope this situation and provide efficient information gather from the consumers. At the end, it resulted the insurance portfolio need suitable with their current risk profile. Additionally this system provides the policy contract design and claim settlement flow. The workforces operate the system also require special skills and expert in many different areas, mainly as insurance math and contract law. This requires a scalable provisioning and “de-provisioning” of human workforces, which we argue that the implementation of Human Cloud service could leverage to better position. According to US Census Bureau (2009) Millennials generations are having the highest percentage 25.47% worldwide. Recent research conduct by APJII in 2012 shows that the Millennials Generation occupied 58.4% Internet users in Indonesia. This figure believes would be more significant in recent future years resulted potential workforces. Understanding their perceived values would be important in order to maximize their potential as future workforces. Extended version of TAM is use for this study which enriches by the Perceived Millennials generation values, which we argue could lead to better understanding to this generation cohort. This extended version of TAM is call as Perceived Millennials Technology Acceptance Model (PerMiTAM). © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Extended TAM; Human cloud; Insurance; Insurance intermediaries systems; PERMITAM","Commerce; Contracts; Risk management; Extended TAM; Financial products; Incomplete information; Insurance companies; Insurance intermediaries; PERMITAM; Potential workforce; Technology acceptance model; Insurance",,,,,"Eckardt, M., (2007) Insurance Intermediation—An Economic Analysis of the Information Services Market, , Springer, Witten, Germany; Eckardt, M., Räthke-Döppner, S., (2008) The Quality of Insurance Intermediary Services—Empirical Evidence For, , Germany; “Smartsheet,” ed; “Predictalot,” ed; (2012) The Profile of Indonesia’s Internet Users, , Indonesia Internet Service Provider Association, Jakarta; Masnick, G., Defining Generations (2012) Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, , http://housingperspectives.blogspot.com/2012/11/defining-generations.html, Available; Davis, F.D., (1986) A Technology Acceptance Model for Empirically Testing New End-User Information Systems: Theory and Results, , Doctoral Dissertation, Sloan School of Management; Park, S.Y., An analysis of the technology acceptance model in understanding university stu-dents’ behavioral intention to use e-learning (2009) Educ.

The research was carried out through several experiments in order to solve integral process with computer through the five types of functions i.e. polynomial functions, exponential functions, trigonometric functions, the combined functions of exponential polynomials, and also the combined functions of trigonometric polynomials. As the point of approximation accuracy relative mistakes is used for the relative error value, and to bookmark the time complexity of the algorithm is used. The test results in the non-parametric statistics Jackknife at a=0.05 level of significance shows that the fifth integral function under study gives the following results: Romberg method has an average relative error, which is smaller than the Adaptive Simpson's method, so it can be concluded that the method of Romberg has a better approximation accuracy compared with the Adaptive Simpson's method in integral approximation. Adaptive Simpson's method has an average processing time, which is smaller than the Romberg method. Thus, it can be concluded that Adaptive Simpson's method requires a shorter processing time than the Romberg method in approximate integral. © 2015 TARU Publications.","adaptive Simpson method; approximation; Method of Romberg; processing time integral","Approximation algorithms; Computational complexity; Error statistics; Exponential functions; Functions; Polynomials; approximation; Exponential polynomials; Method of Romberg; Non-parametric statistics; Processing time; Simpson; Trigonometric functions; Trigonometric polynomial; Integral equations",,,,,"Hamming, R.W., (1971) Introduction to Applied Nurmerical Analysis, , Tokyo: McGraw-Hill, Co; Turner Peter, R., Buchaman, J.L., (1992) Numerical Method and Analysis, , Singapore: McGraw-Hill, Co; Champion, E.R., (1993) Numerical Methods for Engineering Apllications, , New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc; Chapra, S.C., Raymond, P.C., (1991) Numerical Method for Engineers, , New York: McGraw-Hill, Co; Cheney, W., David, K., (1980) Numerical Mathematics and Computing, , Monterey, California: Brooks/Cole Publishing Company; Conte, S.D., de Boor, C., (1980) Elementary Numerical Analysis, , International Student Edition, Tokyo: McGraw-Hill, Co; Nyhoff, L., Leestma, S., (1988) Data Structures and Program Design in Pascal, , New York: Macmillan Publishing Company; Shammas, N.C., (1996) Mathematical Algorithms in Visual Basic, , New York: McGraw-Hill, Co","Polla, G.; BINUS UniversityIndonesia",,,"Taru Publications",,,,,09720502,,,,"English","J.

Since its introduction in year 1990, AC has gained wide popularity for its application in the business world; nevertheless, its application still rare to be found in the vocational schools (known as polytechnics) in Indonesia. In general, the Indonesian polytechnics have lack of AC mechanism in improving their collaboration model with the firms. The article examines the important role of knowledge management (KM) model to improve the AC mechanism inside the state-owned polytechnics. The state-owned polytechnics have mission to support local and national economic corridors, and strengthening the foundation of firms.

Syahdan No. 9, Palmerah, Jakarta 11480, Indonesia","There are many issues in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, and astronomy which can be solved through differential equation formulations. In general, the completion of differential equations can be done analytically or by numerical methods. If the completion is done analytically, usually it is done through calculus theories, and may require a longer time to solve. Anticipating the difficulties posed by differential equations analysis, numerical method is being used instead. This numerical completion provides solution in the form of approach and being carried out by visiting the initial value which then needs to be advanced gradually, step by step. Utilizing computers in solving differential equations would also help develop the application of numerical methods. Therefore, this study is expected to be able to improve the existing methods. This research will compare the accuracy of different methods, the Runge-Kutta Fehlberg and Adams-Moulton methods, in completing differential equations, which is limited to ordinary differential equations of first order and second order. It is found that there is general difference between the two method with Runge-Kutta Fehlberg method being the one-step method with an uncertain step size, while the Adams-Moulton method being the double steps method. Comparison of accuracy is obtained through comparing the value of differential equations results numerically with differential equations result obtained from MatLab version 5.3. A number of experiments on the completion of linear ordinary differential equations of first order and second order are done through computerization to compare the accuracy between the Runge-Kutta Fehlberg and Adams-Moulton methods. In addition, accuracy is being pointed out through relative error. From the research results with the non-parametric statistical test it can be seen that the Jackknife for linear ordinary differential equations of first order and second order, the Runge-Kutta Fehlberg method has an average relative error greater than the Adams-Moulton method. It can be concluded that the Adams-Moulton method has more rigorous accuracy than the Range-Kutta Fehlberg method in solving linear ordinary differential equations of first order and second order. © 2013 Gerardus Polla.","Adams-Moulton Method; Differential equation; Runge-Kutta Fehlberg Method",,,,,,"Herwindiati, D.E., Metode Jackknine dan Metode Bootstrap: Perbedaan dan Aplikasi (1998) Jurnal Komputer dan Elektronika, 1 (1), p. 54; Atkinson, K.E., An Introduction to Numerical Analysis (1978), 2nd ed., Toronto: John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Chapra, S.C., Canale, R.P., Metode Numerik Untuk Teknik (1991), Jakarta: Universitas Indonesia; Chapra, S.C., Canale, R.P., Numerical Methods for Engineers (1989), 2nd ed., Singapore: McGraw-Hill, Co","Polla, G.; Faculty of Sciences and Technology, Jl.

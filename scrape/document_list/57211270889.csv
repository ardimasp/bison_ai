By relying on CPU processing power, current processing power is depending on the frequency and parallelism of the current CPU device. This means this method will lead to increased power consumption. Current research has shown that by utilize the power of GPU processing power to help CPU to do data processing can compete with parallel CPU processing design but in a more energy-efficient way. The usage of GPU to help CPU on doing general-purpose processing has stimulated the appearance of GPU databases. GPU databases have gained its popularity due to its capabilities to process huge amount of data in seconds. In this paper we have explored the open issues on GPU database and introduce a machine learning model to enhance the GPU memory usage on the system by eliminating unnecessary data processing on GPU as on certain queries, CPU processing still outperforms the GPU processing speed. To achieve this, we develop and implement the proposed approach machine learning algorithm using python 3 languages and OmniSci 4.7 for the database system. The applications are running on Ubuntu Linux environment as the GPU environment and Docker as the CPU environment and the results we find that KNN algorithm performs well for this setup with 0.93 F1-Score value. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Until now the problem of congestion has not been resolved properly because the number of vehicles is always increase and the number of roads is inadequate, drivers are not getting complete and updated information about the traffic around them, other than that the parties are also less responsive in handling congestion. Therefore, this study was made to analyze and determine which road segments need special attention, help traffic management, make it easier for users to find out the latest traffic information, and make relevant parties able to take quick response actions. This paper is using social media data, social network such as Facebook is able to provide a real-time data. this data can be processed to gain a powerful insight. However, processing social media data have challenge due to the raw text format, therefore the text processing needs to be done in order to make the data readable. In Jakarta, there is an official account which post a traffic condition in Jakarta. In this paper we are getting the post data from this account, do text processing on it and make a reports and dashboard to provide any user insight regarding the traffic data in Jakarta. © 2019 IEEE.","congestion; dashboard; real time; report; social media; text processing","Data handling; Road vehicles; Social networking (online); Text processing; congestion; dashboard; Real time; report; Social media; Traffic congestion",,,,,,"McIntee, J., How to beat the burn-out (1984) Health Soc.

DPC practically implemented new tax return processing system to replace the old system, however the performance of the new system was not on a par with the old one, at the beginning. Then, DPC made several improvements to increase new system's performance. This study aims to measure the improvements made by DPC by using Six Sigma approach. The approach is functioned to assess data processing performance through DMAIC concept: i.e. define, measure, analyse, improve, and control. With the DMAIC concept, improvement exposes better result, the average value of six sigma significantly escalated by 0.97 to 2.56. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data handling; Process engineering; Process monitoring; Risk management; Systems engineering; Taxation; Work simplification; Average values; Indonesia; Performance measurements; Processing performance; Processing systems; Six sigma approaches; System's performance; Tax returns; Six sigma",,,,,,"Kaushik, P., Khanduja, D., (2009) Total Qual.

In order to reduce the production total cost, e-procurement is introduced. E-procurement means of reducing cost is by shortening cycle time and create a simpler procurement process. The aim of this research is to develop a vendor management and e-procurement system using the Android platform. The developed system is hoped to be able to even shorten the cycle time, ease vendor selection and provide a more flexible and convenience procurement process. Through data measurement and documentation review, the developed system was tested against these three parameters for their validity. In the end, this research summarizes the test result and conclude based on the test result that those parameters are achieved in the developed vendor management and e-procurement system. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Cathodic; Economic; Feasibility; Solar; Technical","Cost reduction; Economics; Engineering research; Industry 4.0; Supply chain management; Android platforms; Cathodic; Data measurements; E-procurement systems; Feasibility; Procurement process; Solar; Technical; Android (operating system)",,,,,"Chaffey, D., (2009) E-Business and E-Commerce Management: Strategy, Implementation and Practice, , 4 (London, England: Pearson Education Limited); Russel, R.S., Taylor, B.W., (2014) Operations and Supply Chain Management, , 8 (Wiley International Edition); Fitzsimmons, J.A., Fitzsimmons, M.J., (2011) Service Management: Operations, Strategy, Information Technology, , ed S.

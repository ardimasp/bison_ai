Conventional analytical approaches struggle with high-dimensional data, leading to high likelihoods of both false-positive and false-negative inferences. Herein, we describe a novel Bayesian pathway analysis approach, the algorithm for learning pathway structure (ALPS), which addresses key limitations in existing approaches to complex data analysis. ALPS uses prior information about pathways in concert with empirical data to identify and quantify complex interactions within networks of factors that mediate an association between an exposure and an outcome. We illustrate ALPS through application to a complex gene-drug interaction analysis in the Predictors of Breast Cancer Recurrence (ProBe CaRe) Study, a Danish cohort study of premenopausal breast cancer patients (2002-2011), for which conventional analyses severely limit the quality of inference. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Hence, researchers have begun to put significant efforts into studying the direct and indirect benefits of wearable devices for health and wellbeing. This paper summarizes recent studies on the use of consumer wearable devices to improve physical activity, mental health, and health consciousness. Methods: A thorough literature search was performed from several reputable data-bases, such as PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, arXiv, and bioRxiv mainly using “wearable device research” as a keyword, no earlier than 2018. As a result, 25 of the most recent and relevant papers included in this review cover several topics, such as previous literature reviews (9 papers), wearable device accuracy (3 papers), self-reported data collection tools (3 papers), and wearable device intervention (10 papers). Results: All the chosen studies are discussed based on the wearable device used, complementary data, study design, and data processing method. All these previous studies indicate that wearable devices are used either to validate their benefits for general wellbeing or for more serious medical contexts, such as cardiovascular dis-orders and post-stroke treatment. Conclusions: Despite their huge potential for adoption in clinical settings, wearable device accuracy and validity remain the key challenge to be met. Some lessons learned and future projections, such as combining traditional study design with statistical and machine learning methods, are highlighted in this paper to provide a useful over-view for other researchers carrying out similar research. © 2020 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.","Exercise; Fitness Tracker; Medical Informatics; Mental Health; Wearable Electronic Device",,,,,"Kementerian Riset Teknologi Dan Pendidikan Tinggi Republik Indonesia","This study is funded by Directorate of Research and Community Service, Directorate General of Research and Development, Indonesian Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education as a part of 2019 Applied Excellent Research in Higher Education Grant.",,"(2019) IDC Reports Strong Growth in the Worldwide Wearables Market, Led by Holiday Shipments of Smart-Watches, Wrist Bands, and Ear-Worn Devices, , https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS44901819, Framingham (MA): IDC Corporate; [cited at 2020 Apr 15].

That is, given these advances, many such studies now consider evaluating an extremely large number of genetic markers (p) genotyped on a small number of subjects (n). Given the dimension of the data, a joint analysis of the markers is often fraught with many challenges, while a marginal analysis is not sufficient. To overcome these obstacles, herein, we propose a Bayesian two-phase methodology that can be used to jointly relate genetic markers to binary traits while controlling for confounding. The first phase of our approach makes use of a marginal scan to identify a reduced set of candidate markers that are then evaluated jointly via a hierarchical model in the second phase. Final marker selection is accomplished through identifying a sparse estimator via a novel and computationally efficient maximum a posteriori estimation technique. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach through extensive numerical studies, and consider a genome-wide application involving colorectal cancer. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The conventional dose of adjuvant tamoxifen overwhelms estrogen in this competition, reducing breast cancer recurrence risk by nearly half. Phase I metabolism generates active tamoxifen metabolites, and phase II metabolism deactivates them. No earlier pharmacogenetic study has comprehensively evaluated the metabolism and transport pathways, and no earlier study has included a large population of premenopausal women. Methods: We completed a cohort study of 5,959 Danish nonmetastatic premenopausal breast cancer patients, in whom 938 recurrences occurred, and a case-control study of 541 recurrent cases in a cohort of Danish predominantly postmenopausal breast cancer patients, all followed for 10 years. We collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor blocks and genotyped 32 variants in 15 genes involved in tamoxifen metabolism or transport. We estimated conventional associations for each variant and used prior information about the tamoxifen metabolic path to evaluate the importance of metabolic and transporter pathways. Results: No individual variant was notably associated with risk of recurrence in either study population. Both studies showed weak evidence of the importance of phase I metabolism in the clinical response to adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. Conclusions: Consistent with prior knowledge, our results support the role of phase I metabolic capacity in clinical response to tamoxifen. Nonetheless, no individual variant substantially explained the modest phase I effect on tamoxifen response. Impact: These results are consistent with guidelines recommending against genotype-guided prescribing of tamoxifen, and for the first time provide evidence supporting these guidelines in premenopausal women. © 2020 American Association for Cancer Research.",,"breast cancer resistance protein; cytochrome P450 1A1; cytochrome P450 2B6; cytochrome P450 2C19; cytochrome P450 2C9; cytochrome P450 2D6; cytochrome P450 3A; cytochrome P450 3A5; estrogen receptor alpha; formaldehyde; glucuronosyltransferase 2B7; glucuronosyltransferase 2B710; glucuronosyltransferase 2B715; multidrug resistance associated protein 2; multidrug resistance protein 1; progesterone receptor; sulfotransferase 1A1; tamoxifen; unclassified drug; adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer recurrence; case control study; clinical effectiveness; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; drug metabolism; drug transport; female; genetic analysis; genetic association; genetic variability; human; human tissue; major clinical study; metabolic regulation; middle aged; paraffin embedding; pharmacogenetics; population; postmenopause; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor",,"cytochrome P450 2B6, 330207-11-9; cytochrome P450 3A, 329322-82-9; cytochrome P450 3A5, 336874-97-6; formaldehyde, 50-00-0; multidrug resistance associated protein 2, 256503-65-8; tamoxifen, 10540-29-1",,"National Cancer Institute, NCI: R01CA118708

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of this hospital-wide opioid education and subsequent institution of postoperative opioid guidelines on opioid-prescribing practices after ambulatory surgery.Methods:This retrospective study was performed at 1 academic orthopaedic hospital. In November 2016, a 1-hour mandatory opioid education program was completed by all hospital prescribers. Postoperative opioid guidelines were then developed and were disseminated in February 2017. All postoperative narcotic prescriptions after ambulatory procedures performed by 3 separate services (hand, sports, and foot and ankle services) were evaluated over 4 months prior to and after the mandatory opioid education and subsequent release of service-specific guidelines.Results:Overall, there was a significant decrease in pills and total oral morphine equivalents prescribed after dissemination of guidelines compared with the pre-intervention cohort procedures (p < 0.001) performed by the sports and hand services. With regard to the sports medicine service, the mean difference in pills prescribed was 6.47 pills (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.4 to 7.5 pills) for knee arthroscopy, 5.6 pills (95% CI, 2.5 to 8.7 pills) for shoulder arthroscopy, and 16.3 pills (95% CI, 13.6 to 19.1 pills) for hip arthroscopy. With regard to the hand service, the mean difference in pills prescribed was 13.0 pills (95% CI, 10.2 to 15.8 pills) for level-1 procedures, 12.4 pills (95% CI, 9.9 to 15.0 pills) for carpal tunnel release, and 21.7 pills (95% CI, 18.0 to 25.3 pills) for distal radial fractures. The decrease in pills prescribed in the post-intervention cohort amounts to almost 30,000 fewer opioid pills prescribed per year after these 6 procedures alone. There was no significant change (p > 0.05) in either the number of pills or the oral morphine equivalents prescribed after any of the 3 procedures performed by the foot and ankle service (ankle arthroscopy, bunion surgery, and Achilles tendon repair).Conclusions:We developed a prescriber education program and followed up with consensus-based guidelines for postoperative opioid prescriptions. These interventions caused a significant decrease in excessive opioid-prescribing practices after ambulatory orthopaedic surgery at our hospital. We urge initiatives by national orthopaedic organizations to develop and promote education programs and procedure and disease-specific opioid-prescribing guidelines. © 2019 By the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Incorporated.",,"morphine; narcotic analgesic agent; achilles tendon; ambulatory surgery; ankle arthroscopy; Article; bunionectomy; clinical article; cohort analysis; consensus; follow up; health care organization; health education; health service; hip arthroscopy; human; knee arthroscopy; postoperative care; practice guideline; prescription; priority journal; radius fracture; retrospective study; shoulder arthroscopy; sports medicine; tendon reconstruction; clinical practice; evaluation study; inappropriate prescribing; medical education; postoperative pain; practice guideline; prescription drug misuse; prevention and control; procedures; program development; program evaluation; United States; Ambulatory Surgical Procedures; Analgesics, Opioid; Consensus; Education, Medical, Continuing; Humans; Inappropriate Prescribing; Pain, Postoperative; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Prescription Drug Misuse; Program Development; Program Evaluation; Retrospective Studies; United States",,"morphine, 52-26-6, 57-27-2; Analgesics, Opioid",,,,,"Baker, D.W., History of the Joint Commission's pain standards: Lessons for today's prescription opioid epidemic (2017) JAMA., 317 (11), pp. 1117-1118. , Mar 21; Volkow, N.D., McLellan, A.T., Opioid abuse in chronic pain-misconceptions and mitigation strategies (2016) N Engl J Med., 374 (13), pp. 1253-1263. , Mar 31; (2018) Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER)., , https://wonder.cdc.gov, Accessed 2018 Oct 19; Morris, B.J., Mir, H.R., The opioid epidemic: Impact on orthopaedic surgery (2015) J Am Acad Orthop Surg., 23 (5), pp. 267-271. , May; Kumar, K., Gulotta, L.V., Dines, J.S., Allen, A.A., Cheng, J., Fields, K.G., YaDeau, J.T., Wu, C.L., Unused opioid pills after outpatient shoulder surgeries given current perioperative prescribing habits (2017) Am J Sports Med., 45 (3), pp. 636-641. , Mar Epub 2017 Feb 9; Dowell, D., Haegerich, T.M., Chou, R., CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain-United States, 2016 (2016) JAMA., 315 (15), pp. 1624-1645. , Apr 19; Kim, N., Matzon, J.L., Abboudi, J., Jones, C., Kirkpatrick, W., Leinberry, C.F., Liss, F.E., Ilyas, A.M., A prospective evaluation of opioid utilization after upper-extremity surgical procedures: Identifying consumption patterns and determining prescribing guidelines (2016) J Bone Joint Surg Am., 98 (20), p. e89. , Oct 19; Grant, D.R., Schoenleber, S.J., McCarthy, A.M., Neiss, G.I., Yorgova, P.K., Rogers, K.J., Gabos, P.G., Shah, S.A., Are we prescribing our patients too much pain medication?

Many people think that they have already met the suggested guidelines. However, most of them were wrong when they quantify their activity level using a personal activity tracker device. This problem indicates the need for personal physical activity tracker or wearable device to maintain the fitness level. However, as wide-range wearable devices available today, it is difficult to find the most suitable one regarding the price and quality. This paper proposes a study to explore the association between the quality and the price of the devices. The quality is evaluated by comparing the accuracy of the heart rate sensor and step counter of several wearable devices with the ground truth measurements. The test result is then analyzed using a series of statistical methods including, a paired t-test, Pearson's correlation test, and Bland-Altman plot. Both t-test and correlation coefficient is used to plot the association between quality and price. © 2019 The Authors.

It is also an important task which aimed to reduce the confounding by ancestry on the relationship of genotypes and disease risk in assocation studies. Several methods have been developed to generate the best ancestry estimated scores even though some of them are still facing inefficient computation time. In this paper, a combination method between KMeans clustering and PCA is proposed estimate ancestry estimation from SNP genotyping data. This method was compared with baseline model, called fastSTRUCTURE, in term of the quality of clustering and computation time. Public data from 1000 Genome project is used to train and evaluate the proposed model and the baseline model. The proposed model can successfully generate clusters with better accuracy than fastSTRUCTURE (91.02% over 90.39%). More importantly, it can boost the computation time until 100 times faster than fastSTRUCTURE (from 490 seconds to 4.86 seconds). © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

These are known as polygenic models and are useful in evaluating risk of disease in patients. These models, however, often do not include important non-genetic factors that are important to the prediction of the disease. In this paper, we explore the prediction of colorectal cancer in Indonesia from non-genetic factors using common machine learning algorithms: XGBoost and Elastic Net. The result of this study identified 8 features with strong importance from both XGBoost and Elastic Net. We recommend including these features as covariates in future genetic association studies of colorectal cancer in Indonesia. Ultimately these models may be implemented as tools to screen patients for colorectal cancer risk. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

These models can help select optimal rice varieties for expected field conditions. Development of a system to help scientist track and make decisions using this data is challenging. It involves incorporation of complex data structures - genomic, phenotypic, and remote sensing - with computationally intensive statistical modeling. In this article, the authors present a web portal designed to help researchers to manage and analyze their datasets, apply machine learning to detect how factors taken together influence crop production, and summarize the results to help scientists make decisions based on the learned models. The authors developed the system to be easily accessed by the entire team including rice scientist, genetics, and farmers.

To build on these advances, and to aid in reducing the prevalence of smoking and its consequent health harms, the next frontier is to identify genetic predictors of successful smoking cessation and also of the efficacy of smoking cessation treatments (""pharmacogenomics""). More broadly, additional biomarkers that can be quantified from biosamples also promise to aid ""Precision Medicine"" and the personalization of treatment, both pharmacological and behavioral. Aims and Methods: To motivate ongoing and future efforts, here we review several compelling genetic and biomarker findings related to smoking cessation and treatment. Results: These Key results involve genetic variants in the nicotinic receptor subunit gene CHRNA5, variants in the nicotine metabolism gene CYP2A6, and the nicotine metabolite ratio. We also summarize reports of epigenetic changes related to smoking behavior. Conclusions: The results to date demonstrate the value and utility of data generated from biosamples in clinical treatment trial settings. This article cross-references a companion paper in this issue that provides practical guidance on how to incorporate biosample collection into a planned clinical trial and discusses avenues for harmonizing data and fostering consortium-based, collaborative research on the pharmacogenomics of smoking cessation. Implications: Evidence is emerging that certain genotypes and biomarkers are associated with smoking cessation success and efficacy of smoking cessation treatments. We review key findings that open potential avenues for personalizing smoking cessation treatment according to an individual's genetic or metabolic profile. These results provide important incentive for smoking cessation researchers to collect biosamples and perform genotyping in research studies and clinical trials. © The Author(s) 2018.

The identification of genomic biomarkers that affect treatment response to smoking cessation treatment, both pharmacological and behavioral, or susceptibility to medication-related adverse reactions, holds real promise to improve treatment efficacy and to tailor the treatment approach to the individual. However, a clear challenge in identifying reliable biomarkers is in obtaining adequate sample sizes. Consortium-based approaches will likely be necessary to yield real successes. Thus, meta-analyses of data from individual smoking cessation trials will become crucial and will be facilitated by standardized trial designs, assessments, and outcomes and harmonizable measures. To foster increased collection of high-quality genetics data in clinical trials, we discuss (1) genetically informed trial design, (2) biological samples (collection requirements, storage, and analysis with a focus on genomic data) and genetics consortia, (3) participant consent and data sharing requirements for Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, and (4) information on phenotype characterization and meta-analysis. This work aligns with the objectives of the Precision Medicine Initiative and offers guidance for integrating treatment research and genetics/genomics within the nicotine and tobacco research community. It is intended to promote the collection and genotyping of biosamples in existing subject samples as well as the integration of genetic research elements into future study designs. This article crossreferences a companion paper in this issue that reviews current evidence on genetic and epigenetic markers in cessation trials. Implications: This article outlines a framework for the consistent integration of biological data/ samples into smoking cessation pharmacotherapy trials, aligned with the objectives of the recently unveiled Precision Medicine Initiative. Our goal is to encourage and provide support for treatment researchers to consider biosample collection and genotyping their existing samples as well as integrating genetic analyses into their study design in order to realize precision medicine in treatment of nicotine dependence. © The Author(s) 2018.

Traditional statistical approaches are identifying simple biomarkers in large samples, but clinical use cases are still being established. High-throughput clinical, imaging, and ‘omic’ technologies are generating data from SUD studies and may lead to more sophisticated and clinically useful models. However, analytic strategies suited for high-dimensional data are not regularly used. We review strategies for identifying biomarkers and biosignatures from high-dimensional data types. Focusing on penalized regression and Bayesian approaches, we address how to leverage evidence from existing studies and knowledge bases, using nicotine metabolism as an example. We posit that big data and machine learning approaches will considerably advance SUD biomarker discovery. However, translation to clinical practice, will require integrated scientific efforts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","artificial intelligence; biomarker; genomics; machine learning; nicotine metabolism; substance use disorders","amfebutamone; nicotine; varenicline; biological marker; Bayes theorem; Bayesian learning; comorbidity; drug dependence; genome-wide association study; human; learning algorithm; nicotine replacement therapy; practice guideline; prediction; prospective study; retrospective study; Review; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; smoking cessation; drug dependence; machine learning; medical research; metabolism; statistical model; Biomarkers; Biomedical Research; Humans; Machine Learning; Models, Statistical; Substance-Related Disorders",,"amfebutamone, 31677-93-7, 34911-55-2; nicotine, 54-11-5; varenicline, 249296-44-4, 375815-87-5; Biomarkers",,"R43DA041211

The process of evaluating genetic markers one by one (i.e. a marginal analysis) may not identify important polygenic and environmental effects. Further, confounding due to growing conditions/factors and genetic similarities among plant varieties may influence conclusions. When developing new plant varieties to optimize yield or thrive in future adverse conditions (e.g. flood, drought), scientists seek a complete understanding of how the factors influence desirable traits. Motivated by a study design that measures rice yield across different seasons, fields, and plant varieties in Indonesia, we develop a regression method that identifies significant genomic factors, while simultaneously controlling for field factors and genetic similarities in the plant varieties. Our approach develops a Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimator under a generalized double Pareto shrinkage prior. Through a hierarchical representation of the proposed model, a novel and computationally efficient expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is developed for variable selection and estimation. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation and is used to analyze rice yields from a pilot study conducted by the Indonesian Center for Rice Research. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Bayesian hierarchical models; EM algorithm; genomic studies; MAP estimator; rice science; shrinkage prior","drought; expectation; genetic similarity; human; Indonesia; nonhuman; pilot study; plant yield; probability; rice; scientist; season; simulation; study design; varietas; algorithm; Bayes theorem; biological model; genetics; genomics; multifactorial inheritance; Oryza; procedures; Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Genomics; Models, Genetic; Multifactorial Inheritance; Oryza",,,,"R01 AI121351

Population-specific variation in metabolic genes contributes to challenges in developing and optimizing pharmacogenetic interventions. We applied a custom genome-wide genotyping array for addiction research (Smokescreen), to three laboratory-based studies of nicotine metabolism with oral or venous administration of labeled nicotine and cotinine, to model nicotine metabolism in multiple populations. The trans-3'-hydroxycotinine/cotinine ratio, the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), was the nicotine metabolism measure analyzed. Methods: Three hundred twelve individuals of self-identified European, African, and Asian American ancestry were genotyped and included in ancestry-specific genome-wide association scans (GWAS) and a meta-GWAS analysis of the NMR. We modeled natural-log transformed NMR with covariates: principal components of genetic ancestry, age, sex, body mass index, and smoking status. Results: African and Asian American NMRs were statistically significantly (P values = 5E-5) lower than European American NMRs. Meta-GWAS analysis identified 36 genome-wide significant variants over a 43 kilobase pair region at CYP2A6 with minimum P = 2.46E-18 at rs12459249, proximal to CYP2A6. Additional minima were located in intron 4 (rs56113850, P = 6.61E-18) and in the CYP2A6-CYP2A7 intergenic region (rs34226463, P = 1.45E-12). Most (34/36) genome-wide significant variants suggested reduced CYP2A6 activity; functional mechanisms were identified and tested in knowledge-bases. Conditional analysis resulted in intergenic variants of possible interest (P values < 5E-5). Conclusions: This meta-GWAS of the NMR identifies CYP2A6 variants, replicates the topranked single nucleotide polymorphism from a recent Finnish meta-GWAS of the NMR, identifies functional mechanisms, and provides pan-continental population biomarkers for nicotine metabolism. © The Author 2016.

Tobacco dependence is associated with increased risk of disease and premature death. While tobacco control efforts and therapeutic interventions have made good progress in reducing smoking prevalence, challenges remain in optimizing their effectiveness based on patient characteristics, including genetic variation. In order to maximize collaborative efforts to advance addiction research, we have developed a genotyping array called Smokescreen. This custom array builds upon previous work in the analyses of human genetic variation, the genetics of addiction, drug metabolism, and response to therapy, with an emphasis on smoking and nicotine addiction. Results: The Smokescreen genotyping array includes 646,247 markers in 23 categories. The array design covers genomewide common variation (65.67, 82.37, and 90.72 % in African (YRI), East Asian (ASN), and European (EUR) respectively); most of the variation with a minor allele frequency ≥ 0.01 in 1014 addiction genes (85.16, 89.51, and 90.49 % for YRI, ASN, and EUR respectively); and nearly all variation from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 1, NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project and HapMap databases in the regions related to smoking behavior and nicotine metabolism: CHRNA5-CHRNA3- CHRNB4 and CYP2A6-CYP2B6. Of the 636 pilot DNA samples derived from blood or cell line biospecimens that were genotyped on the array, 622 (97.80 %) passed quality control. In passing samples, 90.08 % of markers passed quality control. The genotype reproducibility in 25 replicate pairs was 99.94 %. For 137 samples that overlapped with HapMap2 release 24, the genotype concordance was 99.76 %. In a genome-wide association analysis of the nicotine metabolite ratio in 315 individuals participating in nicotine metabolism laboratory studies, we identified genome-wide significant variants in the CYP2A6 region (min p = 9.10E-15). Conclusions: We developed a comprehensive genotyping array for addiction research and demonstrated its analytic validity and utility through pilot genotyping of HapMap and study samples. This array allows researchers to perform genome-wide, candidate gene, and pathway-based association analyses of addiction, tobacco-use, treatment response, comorbidities, and associated diseases in a standardized, high-throughput platform. © 2016 Baurley et al.","Addiction; Bioinformatics; Biomarkers; Genomewide association study; Nicotine dependence; Nicotine metabolism; Pharmacogenomics; Smoking cessation","cytochrome P450 2A6; cytochrome P450 2B6; genetic marker; nicotine; addiction research; African; analytical parameters; Article; bioinformatics; CHRNA3 gene; CHRNA5 gene; CHRNB4 gene; comorbidity; controlled study; CYP2A6 gene; CYP2B6 gene; DNA determination; drug metabolism; East Asian; ethnic difference; European; exome; gene; gene frequency; gene mapping; gene ontology; genetic database; genetic marker; genetic variation; genotype; genotyping technique; high throughput sequencing; human; medical research; minor allele frequency; nicotine metabolite ratio; quality control; reproducibility; Smokescreen genotyping array; smoking; smoking cessation; tobacco dependence; tobacco use; treatment response; validation process; Asian continental ancestry group; Black person; Caucasian; chromosomal mapping; DNA microarray; exon; genetics; genome-wide association study; genotype; metabolism; procedures; single nucleotide polymorphism; African Continental Ancestry Group; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Chromosome Mapping; European Continental Ancestry Group; Exons; Genetic Markers; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Nicotine; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Smoking; Tobacco Use Disorder",,"cytochrome P450 2B6, 330207-11-9; nicotine, 54-11-5; Genetic Markers; Nicotine",,,,,"http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/media-guide/science-drug-abuse-addiction-basics, Accessed 20 Nov 2015; (2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5, , 5th ed.

The study was designed and sponsored by a tobacco company and implemented by contract research organizations in 2002-2003. Multiple analyses of smoking behavior, demographics, and biomarkers were performed. Study data and banked biospecimens were transferred from the sponsor to the Virginia Tobacco and Health Research Repository in 2010, and then to SRI International in 2012, for independent analysis and dissemination. Methods: We analyzed biomarker distributions overall, and by biospecimen availability, for comparison with existing studies, and to evaluate generalizability to the entire sample. We calculated genome-wide statistical power for a priori hypotheses. We performed clinical chemistries, nucleic acid extractions and genotyping, and report correlation and quality control metrics. Results: Vital signs, clinical chemistries, and laboratory measures of tobacco specific and non-specific toxicants are available from 3585 current cigarette smokers, and 1077 non-users. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, red blood cells, plasma and 24-h urine biospecimens are available from 3073 participants (2355 smokers and 719 non-users). In multivariate analysis, participants with banked biospecimens were significantly more likely to self-identify as White, to be older, to have increased total nicotine equivalents per cigarette, decreased serum cotinine, and increased forced vital capacity, compared to participants without. Effect sizes were small (Cohen's d-values∈0.11). Power for a priori hypotheses was 57 % in non-Hispanic Black (N∈=∈340), and 96 % in non-Hispanic White (N∈=∈1840), smokers. All DNA samples had genotype completion rates 97.5 %; 68 % of RNA samples yielded RIN scores 6.0. Conclusions: Total Exposure Study clinical and laboratory assessments and biospecimens comprise a unique resource for cigarette smoke health effects research. The Total Exposure Study Analysis Consortium seeks to perform molecular studies in multiple domains and will share data and analytic results in public repositories and the peer-reviewed literature. Data and banked biospecimens are available for independent or collaborative research. © 2015 Bergen et al.",,"biological marker; cotinine; nicotine; smoke; adult; adverse effects; Black person; blood; Caucasian; chemical analysis; clinical trial; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; Hispanic; human; male; multicenter study; procedures; risk factor; smoke; smoking; statistics and numerical data; tobacco dependence; United States; Virginia; Adult; African Continental Ancestry Group; Biomarkers; Chemistry Techniques, Analytical; Cotinine; Cross-Sectional Studies; European Continental Ancestry Group; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Male; Nicotine; Risk Factors; Smoke; Smoking; Tobacco Use Disorder; United States; Virginia",,"cotinine, 486-56-6; nicotine, 54-11-5; Biomarkers; Cotinine; Nicotine; Smoke",,"National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA: R21DA033813",,,"(2002) Amended Final Research Protocol A Multi-center Study to Determine the Exposure of Adult U S.

We searched for drug metabolizing enzyme and transporter (DMET) gene variation associated with the NMR and prospective abstinence in 2,946 participants of laboratory studies of nicotine metabolism and of clinical trials of smoking cessation therapies. Stage I was a meta-analysis of the association of 507 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 173 DMET genes with the NMR in 449 participants of two laboratory studies. Nominally significant associations were identified in ten genes after adjustment for intragenic SNPs; CYP2A6 and two CYP2A6 SNPs attained experiment-wide significance adjusted for correlated SNPs (CYP2A6 P<inf>ACT</inf>=4.1E-7, rs4803381 P<inf>ACT</inf>=4.5E-5, rs1137115, P<inf>ACT</inf>=1.2E-3). Stage II was mega-regression analyses of 10 DMET SNPs with pretreatment NMR and prospective abstinence in up to 2,497 participants from eight trials. rs4803381 and rs1137115 SNPs were associated with pretreatment NMR at genome-wide significance. In post-hoc analyses of CYP2A6 SNPs, we observed nominally significant association with: abstinence in one pharmacotherapy arm; cigarette consumption among all trial participants; and lung cancer in four case:control studies. CYP2A6 minor alleles were associated with reduced NMR, CPD, and lung cancer risk. We confirmed the major role that CYP2A6 plays in nicotine metabolism, and made novel findings with respect to genome-wide significance and associations with CPD, abstinence and lung cancer risk. Additional multivariate analyses with patient variables and genetic modeling will improve prediction of nicotine metabolism, disease risk and smoking cessation treatment prognosis. © 2015 Bergen et al.",,"cytochrome P450 2A6; cytochrome P450 2D6; drug metabolizing enzyme; drug metabolizing enzyme and transporter; nicotine; peptide transporter 1; solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B1; unclassified drug; cytochrome P450 2A6; nicotine; adult; Article; cancer risk; CBR1 gene; CHST13 gene; CHST8 gene; CYP2A6 gene; CYP2D6 gene; CYP4F3 gene; DMET gene; female; gene; genetic association; genetic variability; human; lung cancer; male; metabolic parameters; metabolism; nicotine metabolism; nicotine metabolite ratio; normal human; post hoc analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; SLC15A1 gene; SLCO1B1 gene; smoking; smoking cessation; SPG7 gene; XDH gene; allele; genetic association study; genetic variation; genetics; metabolism; middle aged; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adult; Alleles; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6; Female; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Variation; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nicotine; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Smoking; Smoking Cessation",,"nicotine, 54-11-5; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6; Nicotine",,"National Cancer Institute, NCI: 00301145

Studies across global diverse populations could offer additional insight given varying types and levels of exposures. Methods: We performed an international case-control study in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (133 cases, 301 controls), Vietnam (75 cases, 158 controls), the Philippines (102 cases, 152 controls), and Honduras (120 cases, 143 controls). Mothers were recruited from hospitals and their exposures were collected from interviewer-administered questionnaires. We used logistic regression modeling to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Family history of clefts was strongly associated with increased risk (maternal: OR = 4.7; 95% CI, 3.0-7.2; paternal: OR = 10.5; 95% CI, 5.9-18.8; siblings: OR = 5.3; 95% CI, 1.4-19.9). Advanced maternal age (5 year OR = 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.3), pregestational hypertension (OR = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3-5.1), and gestational seizures (OR = 2.9; 95% CI, 1.1-7.4) were statistically significant risk factors. Lower maternal (secondary school OR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.2; primary school OR = 2.4, 95% CI, 1.6-2.8) and paternal education (OR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.5; and OR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.9, respectively) and paternal tobacco smoking (OR = 1.5, 95% CI, 1.1-1.9) were associated with an increased risk. No other significant associations between maternal and paternal factors were found; some environmental factors including rural residency, indoor cooking with wood, chemicals and water source appeared to be associated with an increased risk in adjusted models. Conclusion: Our study represents one of the first international studies investigating risk factors for clefts among multiethnic underserved populations.

The goal of a parallel program is to enable the execution of larger problems and to reduce the execution time compared to sequential programs. Among parallel computing frameworks, MapReduce is a framework that enables parallel processing of data on collections of commodity computing nodes without the need to handle the complexities of implementing a parallel program. This paper presents implementations of the parallel Jacobi and Conjugate Gradient methods using MapReduce. A performance analysis shows that MapReduce can speed up the Jacobi method over sequential processing for dense matrices with dimension ≥ 14,000. © 2014 Muhamad Fitra Kacamarga, Bens Pardamean and James Baurley.","Conjugate gradient; Iterative method; Jacobi method; Mapreduce; Parallel computing",,,,,,,,"Legarra, A., Methods based on SNP estimation (BLUP_SNP and BayesCPi etc.) (2012), http://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=uga_2_normal_lasso_bayesc.pdf, [Online].

Cataloging and linking genetic variation in Asian rice to important traits, such as quality and yield, is needed in developing superior varieties of rice. We develop a bioinformatics workflow for quality control and data analysis of genetic and trait data for a diversity panel of 467 rice varieties found in Indonesia. The bioinformatics workflow operates using a back-end relational database for data storage and retrieval. Quality control and data analysis procedures are implemented and automated using the whole genome data analysis toolset, PLINK, and the [R] statistical computing language. The 467 rice varieties were genotyped using a custom array (717,312 genotypes total) and phenotyped for 12 traits in four locations in Indonesia across multiple seasons. We applied our bioinformatics workflow to these data and present prototype genome-wide association results for a continuous trait - days to flowering. Two genetic variants, located on chromosome 4 and 12 of the rice genome, showed evidence for association in these data. We conclude by outlining extensions to the workflow and plans for more sophisticated statistical analyses. © 2014 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","agriculture genetics; bioinformatics; data analysis; genome-wide association study; statistical genetics; workflow","Communication systems; Data reduction; Food supply; Genes; Information technology; Quality control; Days to flowering; Genetic variation; Genome-wide association; Genome-wide association studies; Relational Database; Statistical computing; Statistical genetics; workflow; Bioinformatics",,,,,,,"International rice genome sequencing project: The map-based sequence of the rice genome (2005) Nature, 436 (7052), pp. 793-800; Zhao, K., Tung, C.W., Eizenga, G.C., Wright, M.H., Ali, M.L., Price, A.H., Norton, G.J., McCouch, S., Genome-wide association mapping reveals a rich genetic architecture of complex traits in oryza sativa (2011) Nat.

We performed a targeted genome-wide study of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exons using the Illumina Human Exome+ array with custom fine mapping of 16 cleft susceptibility regions in three underserved populations: Congolese (87 case-mother, 210 control-mother pairs), Vietnamese (131 case-parent trios), and Filipinos (42 casemother, 99 control-mother pairs). All cases were children with cleft lip with or without cleft palate. Families were recruited from local hospitals and parental exposures were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaires. We used logistic regression models for case-control analyses, familybased association tests for trios, and fixed-effect meta-analyses to determine individual SNP effects corrected for multiple testing. Of the 16 known susceptibility regions tested, SNPs in four regions reached statistical significance in one or more of these populations: 1q32.2 (IRF6), 10q25.3 (VAX1), and 17q22 (NOG). Due to different linkage disequilibrium patterns, significant SNPs in these regions differed between the Vietnamese and Filipino populations from the index SNP selected from previous GWAS studies. Among Africans, there were no significant associations identified for any of the susceptibility regions. rs10787738 near VAX1 (P=4.98 E-3) and rs7987165 (P=6.1E-6) were significant in the meta-analysis of all three populations combined. These results confirm several known susceptibility regions and identify novel risk alleles in understudied populations. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","CL(P); GREM1; GWAS; IRF6; NOG; VAX1","adult; Article;

The high-throughput DNA genotyping and sequencing technologies used in these studies produce large amounts of complex data. Agriculture geneticists are faced with numerous computational obstacles with storing, processing, and analyzing genetic and trait data. We introduce a web application for large-scale agriculture genetic diversity and association studies that aims to simplify and automate many of the data management and analysis tasks common across studies. We present a case study where our software is configured and populated with genome-wide data of over 750,000 genetic markers from the commercially available BovineHD array (Illumina Inc.). Our software is scalable to multiple species and applicable to a wide range of genotyping and sequencing technologies and study designs. © 2013 SERSC.","Agriculture genetics; Agriculture information system; Animal breeding; Bioinformatics; Genetic association study; Genetic diversity; Genome-wide; Plant breeding; Statistical genetics",,,,,,,,"(2009) How to Feed the World In 2050, , FTO, Technical Report; Bobby, R., Bazzelle, R., Clark, W., Kantartzi, S.K., Meksem, K., Akond, M., Kassem, M.A., Genetic Analysis of Yield Components in the PI 438489B by 'Hamilton' Recombinant Inbred Line (RIL) Population of Soybean (2012) Journal of Agricultural Science, 4. , [Glycine max (L.)

Bayesian approaches can model multiple variables together and offer advantages over conventional model building strategies, including using existing biological evidence as modeling priors and acknowledging that many models may fit the data well. With many candidate variables, Bayesian approaches to variable selection rely on algorithms to approximate the posterior distribution of models, such as Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Unfortunately, MCMC is difficult to parallelize and requires many iterations to adequately sample the posterior. We introduce a scalable algorithm called PEAK that improves the efficiency of MCMC by dividing a large set of variables into related groups using a rooted graph that resembles a mountain peak. Our algorithm takes advantage of parallel computing and existing biological databases when available.Results: By using graphs to manage a model space with more than 500,000 candidate variables, we were able to improve MCMC efficiency and uncover the true simulated causal variables, including a gene-gene interaction. We applied PEAK to a case-control study of childhood asthma with 2,521 genetic variants. We used an informative graph for oxidative stress derived from Gene Ontology and identified several variants in ERBB4, OXR1, and BCL2 with strong evidence for associations with childhood asthma.Conclusions: We introduced an extremely flexible analysis framework capable of efficiently performing Bayesian variable selection on many candidate variables. The PEAK algorithm can be provided with an informative graph, which can be advantageous when considering gene-gene interactions, or a symmetric graph, which simply divides the model space into manageable regions. The PEAK framework is compatible with various model forms, allowing for the algorithm to be configured for different study designs and applications, such as pathway or rare-variant analyses, by simple modifications to the model likelihood and proposal functions. © 2013 Baurley and Conti; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Bayesian variable selection; Complex relationships; Conventional modeling; Gene-gene interaction; Markov chain Monte Carlo(MCMC); Posterior distributions; Scalable algorithms; Simple modifications; Algorithms; Association reactions; Bayesian networks; Genes; Knowledge based systems; Parallel architectures; Computer simulation; algorithm; article; asthma; Bayes theorem; biological model; biology; case control study; child; genetic association; genetics; human; knowledge base; methodology; Monte Carlo method; probability; single nucleotide polymorphism; Algorithms; Asthma; Bayes Theorem; Case-Control Studies; Child; Computational Biology; Genetic Association Studies; Humans; Knowledge Bases; Markov Chains; Models, Genetic; Monte Carlo Method; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",,,,,,,"Manolio, T.A., Collins, F.S., Cox, N.J., Goldstein, D.B., Hindorff, L.A., Hunter, D.J., McCarthy, M.I., Visscher, P.M., Finding the missing heritability of complex diseases (2009) Nature, 461 (7265), pp. 747-753. , 10.1038/nature08494, 2831613, 19812666; Thomas, D.C., Baurley, J.W., Brown, E.E., Figueiredo, J.C., Goldstein, A., Hazra, A., Wilson, R.T., Rothman, N., Approaches to complex pathways in molecular epidemiology: summary of a special conference of the American Association for Cancer Research (2008) Cancer Research, pp. 10028-10030. , Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089-9011 USA. dthomas@usc.edu, for Cancer Research AA; O'Hara, R., A review of Bayesian variable selection methods: what, how and which (2009) Bayesian Anal, 4 (1), pp. 85-118; Thomas, D.C., Conti, D.V., Baurley, J., Nijhout, F., Reed, M., Ulrich, C.M., Use of pathway information in molecular epidemiology (2009) Human Genomics, 4, pp. 21-42. , 10.1186/1479-7364-4-1-21, 2999471,2999471, 21072972; Baurley, J.W., Conti, D.V., Gauderman, W.J., Thomas, D.C., Discovery of complex pathways from observational data (2010) Stat Med, 29 (19), pp. 1998-2011. , 10.1002/sim.3962, 2922970, 20683892; Quintana, M.A., Berstein, J.L., Thomas, D.C., Conti, D.V., Incorporating model uncertainty in detecting rare variants: the Bayesian risk index (2011) Genet Epidemiol, 35 (7), pp. 638-649. , 10.1002/gepi.20613, 22009789; Raftery, A., Bayesian model selection in social research (1995) Sociol Methodol, 25, pp. 111-163; Hastings, W., Monte Carlo sampling methods using Markov chains and their applications (1970) Biometrika, 57, p. 97; (2013) R: A language and environment for statistical computing, , http://www.R-project.org/, Vienna, Austria: R Foundation for Statistical Computing, ISBN 3-900051-07-0, R Core Team; Gilliland, F.D., McConnell, R., Peters, J., Gong, H., A theoretical basis for investigating ambient air pollution and children's respiratory health (1999) Environ Health Perspect, 107 (SUPPL 3), pp. 403-407. , 10.1289/ehp.99107s3403, 1566227, 10346989; Li, N., Hao, M., Phalen, R.F., Hinds, W.C., Nel, A.E., Particulate air pollutants and asthma.

Over 60 observational studies primarily in non-Hispanic White populations have been conducted on selected genetic variants in specific genes, MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, CBS, TCNII, RFC, GCPII, SHMT, TYMS, and MTHFD1, including five meta-analyses on MTHFR 677C>T (rs1801133) and MTHFR 1298C>T (rs1801131); two meta-analyses on MTR-2756A>C (rs1805087); and one for MTRR 66A>G (rs1801394). Methods and results: This systematic review synthesizes these data, highlighting the consistent inverse association between MTHFR 677TT genotype and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and its null association with adenoma risk. Results for other variants varied across individual studies; in our meta-analyses we observed some evidence for SHMT 1420C>T (rs1979277) ((odds ratio) OR = 0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.73-1.00 for TT v. CC) and TYMS 5' 28 bp repeat (rs34743033) and CRC risk (OR = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.75-0.94 for 2R/3R v. 3R/3R and OR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.69-0.98 for 2R/2R v. 3R/3R). Conclusion: To gain further insight into the role of folate variants in colorectal neoplasia will require incorporating measures of the metabolites, including B-vitamin cofactors, homocysteine and S-adenosylmethionine, and innovative statistical methods to better approximate the folate one-carbon metabolism pathway. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Previously, this data intensive research required computing and personnel resources accessible only to large institutions. Cloud computing allows researchers to analyze their data without a local computing infrastructure. We evaluated the feasibility of cloud computing for association analysis of genome-wide data. Our approach utilized the MapReduce model which divides the analysis into independent units and distributes the work to a computing cloud. We evaluated our approach by modeling the relationships between genetic variants and disease in a simulated genome-wide association study. We generated several data sets of 100,000 subjects and various number of genetic variants, and demonstrated that our analysis approach is scalable and provides an attractive alternative to establishing and maintaining a local computing cluster. © 2012 Springer-Verlag GmbH.",,"Analysis approach; Association analysis; Computational challenges; Computing clusters; Computing infrastructures; Data intensive; Data sets; Genetic data; Genetic variants; Genome-wide association; Genotyping; Map-reduce; Personnel resources; Cloud computing; Cluster computing; Computer applications; Research; Genes",,,,,,,"Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, , http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/; Amazon Elastic Mapreduce, , http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/; Amazon Elastic Mapreduce Pricing, , http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/pricing/; Amazon Simple Storage Service, , http://aws.amazon.com/s3/; Amazon Web Services, , http://aws.amazon.com; http://hadoop.apache.org/; Illumina Snp Genotyping, , http://www.illumina.com/applications/detail/ snp_genotyping_and_cnv_analysis/ whole_genome_genotyping_and_copy_number_variation_analysis.ilmn; Dean, J., (2004) Mapreduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters, , http://www.eecs.umich.edu/?klefevre/eecs584/Handouts/mapreduce.pdf, Usenix SDI; Mell, P., (2009) The Nist Definition of Cloud Computing, , http://www.mendeley.com/research/nist-definition-cloud-computing-v15/, National Institute of Standards and Technology; Purcell, S., Neale, B., Todd-Brown, K., Thomas, L., Ferreira, M.A.R., Bender, D., Maller, J., Sham, P.C., Plink: A tool set for whole-genome association and population-based linkage analyses (2007) Am.

Objectives: We aimed to identify additional asthma risk loci by performing an extensive replication study of the results from the EVE Consortium meta-analysis. Methods: We selected 3186 single nucleotide polymorphisms for replication based on the P values from the EVE Consortium meta-analysis. These single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in ethnically diverse replication samples from 9 different studies, totaling 7202 cases, 6426 controls, and 507 case-parent trios. Association analyses were conducted within each participating study, and the resulting test statistics were combined in a meta-analysis. Results: Two novel associations were replicated in European Americans: rs1061477 in the KLK3 gene on chromosome 19 (combined odds ratio = 1.18; 95% CI, 1.10-1.25) and rs9570077 (combined odds ratio =1.20; 95% CI, 1.12-1.29) on chromosome 13q21. We could not replicate any additional associations in the African Americans or Latinos. Conclusions: This extended replication study identified 2 additional asthma risk loci in populations of European descent. The absence of additional loci for African Americans and Latinos highlights the difficulty in replicating associations in admixed populations. © 2012 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","Asthma; genetic risk factors; KLK3; meta-analysis","African American; article; asthma; controlled study; European American; gene locus; genetic risk; genotype; Hispanic; human; major clinical study; meta analysis (topic); priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; asthma; Caucasian; chromosome 19; genetic association; genetic predisposition; genetics; immunology; multicenter study; nucleotide sequence; risk factor; United States; kallikrein; kallikrein related peptidase 3, human; kallikrein-related peptidase 3, human; prostate specific antigen; African Americans; Asthma; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19; DNA Mutational Analysis; European Continental Ancestry Group; Genetic Loci; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Kallikreins; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Risk Factors; United States",,"kallikrein, 8006-48-2, 9001-01-8; Kallikreins, 3.4.21.-; Prostate-Specific Antigen, 3.4.21.77; kallikrein-related peptidase 3, human, 3.4.21.-",,"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK: R01DK064695

We performed a meta-analysis of North American genome-wide association studies of asthma in 5,416 individuals with asthma (cases) including individuals of European American, African American or African Caribbean, and Latino ancestry, with replication in an additional 12,649 individuals from the same ethnic groups. We identified five susceptibility loci. Four were at previously reported loci on 17q21, near IL1RL1, TSLP and IL33, but we report for the first time, to our knowledge, that these loci are associated with asthma risk in three ethnic groups. In addition, we identified a new asthma susceptibility locus at PYHIN1, with the association being specific to individuals of African descent (P = 3.9 × 10-9). These results suggest that some asthma susceptibility loci are robust to differences in ancestry when sufficiently large samples sizes are investigated, and that ancestry-specific associations also contribute to the complex genetic architecture of asthma. © 2011 Nature America, Inc.

We sought to determine whether TSLP SNPs are associated with asthma in a sex-specific fashion. Methods: We conducted regular and sex-stratified analyses of association between SNPs in TSLP and asthma in families of children with asthma in Costa Rica. Significant findings were replicated in whites and African-American participants in the Childhood Asthma Management Program, in African-Americans in the Genomic Research on Asthma in the African Diaspora study, in whites and Hispanics in the Childrens Health Study, and in whites in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). Main Results: Two SNPs in TSLP (rs1837253 and rs2289276) were significantly associated with a reduced risk of asthma in combined analyses of all cohorts (P values of 2×105 and 1×105, respectively). In a sex-stratified analysis, the T allele of rs1837253 was significantly associated with a reduced risk of asthma in males only (P=3×106). Alternately, the T allele of rs2289276 was significantly associated with a reduced risk of asthma in females only (P=2×104). Findings for rs2289276 were consistent in all cohorts except the FHS. Conclusions: TSLP variants are associated with asthma in a sex-specific fashion. © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.","Asthma; Genetic association; Sex-specific; Thymic stromal lymphopoietin; TSLP","thymic stromal lymphopoietin; adolescent; adult; African American; aged; article; asthma; Caucasian; child; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; correlation analysis; Costa Rica; female; gene frequency; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic susceptibility; genotype; Hispanic; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; risk reduction; school child; sex difference; single nucleotide polymorphism; African Continental Ancestry Group; Asthma; Child; Cohort Studies; Costa Rica; Cytokines; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Sex Characteristics",,"Cytokines; thymic stromal lymphopoietin",,"National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS: P30ES007048, P01ES011627

Although standard frequentist methods still have a role in hypothesis generation and testing for discovery of novel main effects and interactions, Bayesian methods are particularly well suited to modeling the relationships in an integrated ""systems biology"" manner. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the principles of Bayesian analysis and their advantages in this context and describe various approaches to applying them for both model building and discovery in a genome-wide setting. In particular, we highlight the ability of Bayesian methods to construct complex probability models via a hierarchical structure and to account for uncertainty in model specification by averaging over large spaces of alternative models. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",,"Bayes theorem; biological model; book; general aspects of disease; genetic association; genetics; human; single nucleotide polymorphism; Bayes Theorem; Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Models, Genetic; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",,,,,,,"Baurley, J.W., Conti, D.V., Gauderman, W.J., Thomas, D.C., Discovery of complex pathways from observational data (2010) Stat.

We introduce a pathway modeling framework that discovers plausible pathways from observational data, and allows estimation of both the net effect of the pathway and the types of interactions occurring among genetic or environmental risk factors. Each discovered pathway structure links combinations of observed variables through intermediate latent nodes to a final node, the outcome. Biologic knowledge can be readily applied in this framework as a prior on pathway structure to give preference to more biologically plausible models, thereby providing more precise estimation of Bayes factors for pathways of greatest interest by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Data were simulated for binary inputs of which only a subset was involved in different pathway topologies. Our algorithm was then used to recover the pathway from the simulated data. The posterior distributions of inputs, pairwise and higher-order interactions, and topologies were obtained by MCMC methods. The evidence in favor of a particular pathway or interaction was summarized using Bayes factors. Our method can correctly identify the risk factors and interactions involved in the simulated pathway. We apply our framework to an asthma case-control data set with polymorphisms in 12 genes.

This was the focus of Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 Group 10 contributions, which introduced a variety of new methods for the detection of G x E interactions in both case-control and family-based data using both cross-sectional and longitudinal study designs. Many of these contributions detected significant G x E interactions. Although these interactions have not yet been confirmed, the results suggest the importance of testing for interactions. Issues of sample size, quantifying the environmental exposure, longitudinal data analysis, family-based analysis, selection of the most powerful analysis method, population stratification, and computational expense with respect to testing G x E interactions are discussed. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Case-control; Cross-sectional; Family-based; Framingham Heart Study; GAW; GWAS; Longitudinal; Rheumatoid arthritis","case control study; conference paper; environmental exposure; family assessment; gene interaction; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic analysis; genetic association; genotype environment interaction; human; ischemic heart disease; longitudinal study; population genetics; rheumatoid arthritis; sample size; single nucleotide polymorphism; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Cardiovascular Diseases; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environment; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Molecular Epidemiology; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",,,,"National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS: R01GM031575",,,"Arya, R., Hare, E., Del Rincon, I., Jenkinson, C.P., Duggirala, R., Almasy, L., Escalante, A., Effects of covariates and interactions on a genome-wide association analysis of rheumatoid arthritis (2009) BMC Proc, 3, pp. S84; Browning, B.L., Browning, S.R., Efficient multilocus association testing for whole genome association studies using localized haplotype clustering (2007) Genet Epidemiol, 31, pp. 365-375; Chiu, Y.F., Kao, H.Y., Chen, Y.S., Hsu, F.C., Yang, H.C., Assessment of gene-covariate interactions by incorporating covariates into association mapping (2009) BMC Proc, 3, pp. S85; Devine, O.J., Smith, J.M., Estimating sample size for epidemiologic studies: The impact of ignoring exposure measurement uncertainty (1998) Stat Med, 17, pp. 1375-1389; Gu, C.C., Yang, W., Kraja, A.T., De Las Fuentes, L., Dávila-Román, V.G., Genetic association analysis of coronary heart disease by profiling gene x environment interaction based on latent components in longitudinal endophenotypes (2009) BMC Proc, 3, pp. S86; Joubert, B.R., Diao, G., Lin, D., North, K.E., Franceschini, N., Longitudinal age-dependent effect on systolic blood pressure (2009) BMC Proc, 3, pp. S87; Khoury, M.J., Flanders, W.D., Nontraditional epidemiologic approaches in the analysis of gene-environment interaction: Case-control studies with no controls!

A genome-wide association (GWA) study of asthma with 359 cases from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) and 846 genetically matched controls from the Illumina ICONdb public resource was performed. The strongest region of association seen was on chromosome 5q12 in PDE4D. The phosphodiesterase 4D, cAMP-specific (phosphodiesterase E3 dunce homolog, Drosophila) gene (PDE4D) is a regulator of airway smooth-muscle contractility, and PDE4 inhibitors have been developed as medications for asthma. Allelic p values for top SNPs in this region were 4.3 × 10-07 for rs1588265 and 9.7 × 10-07 for rs1544791. Replications were investigated in ten independent populations with different ethnicities, study designs, and definitions of asthma. In seven white and Hispanic replication populations, two PDE4D SNPs had significant results with p values less than 0.05, and five had results in the same direction as the original population but had p values greater than 0.05. Combined p values for 18,891 white and Hispanic individuals (4,342 cases) in our replication populations were 4.1 × 10-04 for rs1588265 and 9.2 × 10-04 for rs1544791. In three black replication populations, which had different linkage disequilibrium patterns than the other populations, original findings were not replicated. Further study of PDE4D variants might lead to improved understanding of the role of PDE4D in asthma pathophysiology and the efficacy of PDE4 inhibitor medications. © 2009 The American Society of Human Genetics.",,"antiasthmatic agent; bronchodilating agent; cyclic AMP; glucocorticoid; phosphodiesterase III; phosphodiesterase IV inhibitor; adolescent; adult; airway; allele; article; asthma; child; chromosome 5q; control group; controlled study; Drosophila; drug efficacy; ethnicity; female; gene; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene replication; genetic analysis; genetic association; genetic identification; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; Hispanic; human; major clinical study; male; pathophysiology; phosphodiesterase IV d gene; priority journal; school child; single nucleotide polymorphism; smooth muscle contractility; treatment duration; Adolescent; Adult; Asthma; Child; Cohort Studies; Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetics, Population; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Linkage Disequilibrium; Middle Aged; Young Adult",,"cyclic AMP, 60-92-4; Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4, 3.1.4.17",,"National Human Genome Research Institute, NHGRI

Marginal effects of polymorphisms in the selected genes, and occasionally pairwise gene-gene or gene-environment interactions,are often presented, but a unified approach to modelling the entire pathway has been lacking. In this review, a variety of approaches to this problem is considered, focusing on hypothesis-driven rather than purely exploratory methods. Empirical modelling strategies are based on hierarchical models that allow prior knowledge about the structure of the pathway and the various reactions to be included as 'prior covariates'. By contrast, mechanistic models aim to describe the reactions through a system of differential equations with rate parameters that can vary between individuals, based on their genotypes. Some ways of combining the two approaches are suggested and Bayesian model averaging methods for dealing with uncertainty about the true model form in either framework is discussed. Biomarker measurements can be incorporated into such analyses, and two-phase sampling designs stratified on some combination of disease, genes and exposures can be an efficient way of obtaining data that would be too expensive or difficult to obtain on a full candidate gene sample.

Specific aims were to (1) create the infrastructure necessary to develop and sustain clinical trials research in rehabilitation, (2) generate evidence to evaluate the efficacy of resistance exercise-based physical interventions designed to improve muscle performance and movement skills, and (3) provide education and training opportunities for present and future clinician-researchers and for the rehabilitation community at-large in its support of evidence-based practice. We present the network's infrastructure, development, and several examples that highlight the benefits of a clinical research network. We suggest that the network structure is ideal for building research capacity and fostering multisite, multiinvestigator clinical research projects designed to generate evidence for the efficacy of rehabilitation interventions.

Rather than simply selecting a subset of most significant marker-disease associations at some cutoff chosen to maximize the cost efficiency of a multistage design, we propose a prior model for the true noncentrality parameters of these associations composed of a large mass at zero and a continuous distribution of nonzero values. The prior probability of nonzero values and their prior means can be functions of various covariates characterizing each marker, such as their location relative to genes or evolutionary conserved regions, or prior linkage or association data. We propose to take the top ranked posterior expectations of the noncentrality parameters for confirmation in later stages of a genomewide scan. The statistical performance of this approach is compared with the traditional p-value ranking by simulation studies. We show that the ranking by posterior expectations performs better at selecting the true positive association than a simple ranking of p-values if at least some of the prior covariates have predictive value. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Bayesian methods; Genomewide association scans; Hierarchical models; Multistage designs; Single nucleotide polymorphisms","article; Bayes theorem; cost effectiveness analysis; disease association; disease marker; genetic association; genetic linkage; genome; probability; regression analysis; simulation; statistical analysis; statistical significance; Bayes Theorem; Computer Simulation; Genetic Diseases, Inborn; Genetic Markers; Genome; Humans; Models, Statistical; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Statistics as Topic",,"Genetic Markers",,"National Cancer Institute, NCI: R01CA052862",,,"Altshuler, D., Brooks, L.D., Chakravarti, A., Collins, F.S., Daly, M.J., Donnelly, P., A haplotype map of the human genome (2005) Nature, 437, pp. 1299-1320; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) J Roy Statist Soc, Ser B, 57, pp. 289-300; Bierut, L.J., Madden, P.A., Breslau, N., Johnson, E.O., Hatsukami, D., Pomerleau, O.F., Swan, G.E., and others, Novel genes identified in a high-density genome wide association study for nicotine dependence (2007) Hum Mol Genet, 16, pp. 24-35; Botstein, D., Risch, N., Discovering genotypes underlying human phenotypes: Past successes for mendelian disease, future approaches for complex disease (2003) Nat Genet, 33 (SUPPL.), pp. 228-237; Conti, D.V., Witte, J.S., Hierarchical modeling of linkage disequilibrum: Genetic structure and spatial relations (2003) Am J Hum Genet, 72, pp. 351-363; Duerr, R.H., Taylor, K.D., Brant, S.R., Rioux, J.D., Silverberg, M.S., Daly, M.J., Steinhart, A.H., Griffiths, A., A genome-wide association study identifies IL23R as an inflammatory bowel disease gene (2006) Science, 314, pp. 1461-1463; Ellis, N.A., Kirchhoff, T., Mitra, N., Ye, T.-Z., Chuai, S., Huang, H., Nafa, K., Gordon, D., Localization of breast cancer susceptibility loci by genome-wide SNP linkage disequilibrium mapping (2006) Genetic Epidemiol, 30, pp. 48-61; Fraser-Bell, S., Donofrio, J., Wu, J., Klein, R., Azen, S.P., Varma, R., Sociodemographic factors and age-related macular degeneration in Latinos: The Los Angeles Latino Eye Study (2005) Am J Ophthalmol, 139, pp. 30-38; Gudmundsson, J., Sulem, P., Manolescu, A., Amundadottir, L.T., Gudbjartsson, D., Helgason, A., Rafhar, T., Baker, A., Genome-wide association study identifies a second prostate cancer susceptibility variant at 8q24 (2007) Nat Genet, , in press; Maniatis, N., Morton, N.E., Gibson, J., Xu, C.F., Hosking, L.K., Collins, A., The optimal measure of linkage disequilibrium reduces error in association mapping of affection status (2005) Hum Mol Genet, 14, pp. 145-153; Maraganore DM, de Andrade M, Lesnick TG, Strain KJ, Fairer MJ, Rocca W, Pant PVK, Frazer KA, Cox DR, Bellinger DG. 2005.

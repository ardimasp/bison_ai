Smart education is a learning concept that is developed by intelligent technology development. Therefore smart education must be able to provide an update of learning methods. Smart education must make it easier for users to interact and collaborate to make, organize, and share knowledge from anywhere and at any time accessible. In this paper, we conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) research method to find out the features that exist in MOOCs in the era of intelligent education. This paper presents a comprehensive view of the development of MOOC features in the era of smart education in higher education. Our contribution is comprehensive information about MOOC features in the era of intelligent education in higher education, to improve the quality of learning, and possible use in practice. © 2019 IEEE.","MOOC; smart education; systematic literature review; the era of smart education","E-learning; Comprehensive information; Intelligent educations; Intelligent technology; Massive open online course; MOOC; Quality of learning; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Learning systems",,,,,"Akhrif, O., El Idrissi, Y.E.B., Hmina, N., Smart university: Soc-based study (2018) Proc. 3rd Int.

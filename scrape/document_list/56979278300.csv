In this paper, we show the review of Decision Tree implementation for learning user preferences data expressed in pairwise comparisons. Decision Tree can be considered as one of the suitable methods for this problem due to its white-box approach, so that we can evaluate the result and re-use the model for further analysis, such as giving a recommendation. We used 10-fold cross-validation and hold-out technique to evaluate the performance of four different decision tree algorithms. The result shows that some decision tree algorithms like J48 outperform the others for learning pairwise preferences on a specific training split point. This paper has demonstrated, through use cases and experiments of pairwise preference problem, the effectiveness of decision tree method, and of its novel use of learning ordinal data. © 2020 IEEE.","decision tree; machine learning; ordinal data; pairwise comparisons; symbolic approach; user preferences","Decision trees; Learning systems; Trees (mathematics); 10-fold cross-validation; Comparative analysis; Decision tree method; Decision-tree algorithm; Machine learning methods; Ordinal data; Pair-wise comparison; Split points; Learning algorithms",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

The case of Bina Nusantara University’s library is used in this study. In this kind of library, near field communication (NFC) tags are placed in the book for getting book information, borrowing or returning and theft prevention, so the application. Stocktaking is an important process to be performed periodically to monitor and maintain the quality of collections and to make these collections easily accessible for library users. However, stocktaking in libraries takes too much effort and needs to be more efficient. Design/methodology/approach: The design of the mobile application using entity relationship diagram (ERD) includes a diagram and flowchart. An evaluation is done by comparing the stocktaking effort of the latest semester and the previous semester. In the latest semester, the stocktaking is done by a hybrid of the proposed mobile application and a legacy desktop application, whereas the stocktaking of the previous semester is done only using the legacy desktop application. Findings: Evaluation of the usage of this mobile stocktaking application is 43 per cent more efficient compared to an older desktop application.

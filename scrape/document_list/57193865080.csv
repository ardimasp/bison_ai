The purpose of presentation is to demonstrate or introduce presenters' idea to the attendees. Within the given time and specific place, presenters must transfer their knowledge and leave great impression for their audience. Generally, presenters use several handy tools such as mouse, presenter, and webcam to help them to navigate their slides. Nevertheless, some of these tools have several constraints and limitations such as not portable and does not support multimedia. In this research, we develop an application that assist presenters to control their presentation materials by using Microsoft KINECT. In this research, we manipulate colour image, image depth, and the skeleton of the presenters captured by the KINECT. Then, we show the post-process image results into the projector screen. The KINECT has more useful than other tools because it supports video and audio recording. Moreover, it also able to capture presenters' movement that can be used as an input to interact and manipulate the content (i.e. by touching the projection wall). Not only this application provides an alternative in controlling presentation activity, but it also makes the presentation more efficient and attractive. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Colour image; Handy tools; Image depth; It supports; Microsoft kinect; Post process; Physics",,,,,"Nejem, K.M., Muhanna, W., The Effect of Using Smart Board on Mathematics Achievement and Retention of Seventh Grade Students Int.

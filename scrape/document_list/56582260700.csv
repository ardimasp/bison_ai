This research explained the knowledge management model focus on how to manage tacit and explicit knowledge of medical personnel in hospital at Indonesia, because the main problem is how the senior medical personnel transfer the knowledge to explicit form or vice versa. The research used descriptive statistic to analysis from thirty-Three hospitals knowledge mode or conversion from tacit-explicit or explicit-Tacit.

Beside the impairment of social interaction and communication symptom, Diagnostic of statistical manual of mental disorders fifth edition (DSM – 5) by American Psychiatric Association APA explained other symptoms such as: restricted, repetitive pat-terns of behavior, interests, or activities. Technology proved to be a very effective method in providing students with special needs opportunities to engage in basic drill and practices or communication activities. Therefore, this article discusses about the research element and research trends on Computer Human Interaction (CHI) research on children with ASD. 117 articles found and 38 articles are selected for reviewed in order to find the research element and term used in CHI Research for children with ASD. 15 of the articles are using qualitative method and 14 are using mix method between qualitative and quantitative. Most of the research participants are the children with ASD. The most favorite development methodology type is the participatory design.

One of the communication ways between the government and citizen are the annual tax reporting services. e-Filing are the personal tax report application in Indonesia that provided by the Directorate General of Taxes under the Ministry of Finance, Republic of Indonesia. This system plays an important role in the government's efforts to reduce the queue in the reporting tax. This research aimed to find the correlations between trust and the usage of e-Filing application. Collected data are 61 respondents where 39 respondents experienced in using the e-Filing will be analyzed using the method of Partial Least Square – Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM). The evaluation results of the measurement model found that the usage of the application is weakly unaffected by 26% of public trust in the government. © IAEME Publication","E-Filing; Government; PLS-SEM; Trust; Usage",,,,,,,"Alsaghier, H., Ford, M., Nguyen, A., Hexel, R., Conceptualising citizen’s trust in E government: Application of Q methodology (2009) Electron.

Then analyze business processes and problems, as well as the user requirements using difference table analysis. From the analysis, the consultant identified the problems that exist. After getting the requirement, conducted stages of planning new business processes or Blueprint. The Blueprint contains the system running now (as-is) and the design of the system that will be applied (to-be) which will be used in the realization stage to perform configuration, customization, data migration and testing interfaces. The next stage is the final preparation, where consultants will conduct final testing, create a user manual and conduct user training.

The benefits of this research for educators are expected to give feedback for them on the use of social media Facebook as a media for learning activities. The use of social media Facebook as a learning media will increase the motivation of non-regular students in learning activities. The main objective of this research is to analyze the impacts of the use of social media Facebook as a learning media for learning motivation of non-regular students. Method of data collection is use questionnaires given to 126 respondents to the category of non-regular students and the analysis of data using a single regression model. In this research, the authors tested a model and the results shows that the model receives H1 and reject H0. From the test results it can be concluded that the factor of use of social media Facebook as a learning media can increase learning motivation.","Facebook; Motivation; Social media","Motivation; Regression analysis; Students; Surveys; Analysis of data; Case study approach; Data collection; Facebook; Learning Activity; Learning motivation; Regression model; Social media; Social networking (online)",,,,,,"Horton, W., (2012) E-Learning by Design, , USA: Pfeiffer; Malik, M., Parveen, N., Intrinsic Motivation of the High and Low Academic Achievers (2015) American Journal of Educational Research, 3 (11), pp. 1481-1483; Sugiyono, P.D., (2013) Metode Penelitian Bisnis (Pendekatan Kuantitatif, Kualitatif, Dan R&D), , Bandung: ALFABETA; Angus Stevenson, C.A.L., (2015) New Oxford American Dictionary, , http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/simulation, 12 January Online; Centeno, M.A., An Introduction to Simulation Modeling (1996) Proceedings of The 1996 Winter Simulation Conference, pp. 15-21; Sarwono, J., (2012) Metode Riset Skripsi Pendekatan Kuantitatif Menggunakan Prosedur SPSS, , Jakarta: PT Elex Media Komputindo; Lam, L., An Innovative Research on the usage of Facebook in the Higher Education context of Hong Kong (2012) The Electronic Journal of E-Learning, 10 (4), pp. 377-386",,"Castillo O.Douglas C.Ao S.I.Feng D.D.Korsunsky A.M.","","Newswood Limited","2017 International MultiConference of Engineers and Computer Scientists, IMECS 2017","15 March 2017 through 17 March 2017",,133365,20780958,9789881404732,,,"English","Lect.

Business process simulation applications has two major subsystems, namely wholesale and retail sales. The business activities that will be developed in the business process simulation system are the incoming inquiries, sales orders, delivery and billing. In addition there is also a part of the procurement cycle such as purchase orders. With this software, the students will be able directly interact with the simulation systems and business process practice has been applied to the industry. In this application there are some additional features that support simulation analysis, such as wholesale analysis and billing list generation process. And there are also features related reporting process such as purchase order reports, reports of wholesale and retail sales orders, profits and loss, cash flow, balance sheet and capital reports. We hope through research and development of this system, the students will get an overview of the actual business process-related business processes of sales, distribution, and business workflow in the company. By creating a business process simulation applications, we hope this application can help students to learn the business processes of sales and distribution processes more effectively.","Business process; Information systems; Learning activities; Simulation; Systems design","Computer software; File organization; Information systems; Purchasing; Students; Systems analysis; Business activities; Business Process; Business process simulation; Learning Activity; Research and development; Sales and distribution; Simulation; Simulation analysis; Sales",,,,,,"Achimugu, P., Oluwagbemi, O., Oluwaranti, A., An evaluation of the impact of ICT diffusion in Nigeria’s higher educational institutions (2010) Journal of Information Technology Impact; Serrano, A., Hengst, M., Modeling the integration of BP and IT using business process simulation (2005) Journal or Enterprise Information Management, 18 (6), pp. 740-759; Popovic, A., Jaklic, J., Problematika simuliranja poslovnih procesov (2004) Proceedings of DSI 2004 - Management in Informatika, pp. 166-172. , Portoroz; Barber, K.D., Dewhurst, F.W., Burns, R.L.D., Rogers, J.B.B., Business-process modelling and simulation for manufacturing management: A practical way forward (2003) Business Process Management Journal, 9 (4), pp. 527-542; Damij, N., Damij, T., A Multi-disciplinary Guide to Theory, Modeling, and Methodology (2014) Progress in IS, , Berlin Heidelberg: Springer; Patig, S., Stolz, M., A pattern-based approach for the verification of business process descriptions (2013) Information and Software Technology, 55 (1), pp. 58-87. , Special section: Best papers from the 2nd International Symposium on Search Based Software Engineering, 2010; Savén, R., Olhager, J., Integration of product, process and functional orientations: Principles and a case study (2003) Collaborative Systems for Production Management, 129, pp. 375-389. , In: Jagdev H, Wortmann J, Pels H, editors. of IFIP—The International Federation for Information Processing.

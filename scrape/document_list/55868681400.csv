Since there is limited research in Indonesia to explain this issue, many hoteliers will need to take advantage of new research with this trend of growing numbers of female travellers in Indonesia. The objective of this study was to briefly examine the satisfaction of female business travellers in Indonesia related to desired hotel attributes. This research used a quantitative analysis and structured questionnaires which were distributed to 150 respondents who were female business travellers. The method of collecting the data was by spreading online questionnaires through Google forms. To analyze the data, SPSS statistics software was used to run multiple linear regression tests. The results of the research indicate that the facility safety and security and room quality are the key significant factors for female business traveller's satisfaction with hotel attributes considered. It can be said that Indonesians female business travellers prefer valuing their satisfaction of hotel attributes depending on facilities provided by the hotel industry. So, using this research the hotel industry can perhaps gain female business traveller satisfaction based on the attributes provided by focusing on the provision of a facility which has safety and security, clean rooms and things such as fast internet connections, and entertaining TV cable channels. © 2019 AJHTL Authors.","Facility; Female business traveller; Hotel industry; Indonesia; Satisfaction",,,,,,"Albayrak, T., Caber, M., Prioritisation of the Hotel Attributes According to Their Influence on Satisfaction: A Comparison of Two Techniques (2015) Tourism Management, 46, pp. 43-50; Alegre, J., Garau, J., Tourist Satisfaction and Dissatisfaction (2010) Annals of Tourism Research, 37 (1), pp. 52-73; Amin, M., Yahya, Z., Ismayatim, W.F.A., Nasharuddin, S.Z., Kassim, E., Service Quality Dimension and Customer Satisfaction: An Empirical Study in the Malaysian Hotel Industry (2013) Services Marketing Quarterly, 34 (2), pp. 15-125; Anton, J., Customer Relationship Management: Making Hard Decisions With Soft Numbers (1997) Journal of Leisure Research, 29 (3), p. 355; Artaya, I.P., Arimbawa, I.G., Croostab's Method of Use to Test the Linearity Hotel Facilities Variable (2018) Workers and Credibility Competency Level Customer Satisfaction With Service in Denpasar Hotel Inna Grand Bali Beach, , https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324983866; (2014), https://languages.oup.com/; (2019) Keadaan Angkatan Kerja di Indonesia, , BPS, Indonesia; Baker, S., Huyton, J., Bradley, P., (2000) Principles of Hotel Front Office Operation, , 2nd edn.

One of the popular aspects of tourism for tourists is eco-tourism. Unfortunately, most eco-tourism destinations in Indonesia are in obscure or rural areas that are lacking in telecommunication signals as the area. Given the rapid uptake of smartphone technology and associated applications there is a need to evaluate the current and emerging state of the art and what this means for the tourism domain. Therefore, the nature of this study is to know what eco-tourists in Indonesia need from an offline application in the rural areas due to the lack of web access. This study uses quantitative and qualitative research methods. A questionnaire comprising 150 questions was distributed among eco-tourists in Jakarta. Content analysis was conducted among different websites and applications related to tourism in Indonesia. Providing a good experience with useful apps is helpful to motivate tourists to revisit the destination. This platform can be used by practitioners and researchers as a guideline to design usable mobile applications for eco-tourists and other niche segments of tourism. © 2017. ASERS Publishing.

Although the number of tourists visiting Indonesia is increasing, the fact about educational tourism and its effect on residents’ perception has not been explored. The objective of this study is to understand the implication of educational tourism in relation to local residents. A qualitative approach was conducted with some local residents. The study revealed those local residents’ both negative and positive aspects of educational tourism.

A qualitative approach through face-to-face interviews conducted to know the viewpoints of local people from Yogyakarta. The findings propose new insights into the different impacts of tourism and community development practices. These findings show the positive and negative aspects of tourism on the local community. This study concludes that although the host population perceives different point of views with tourism development, overall the Yogyakarta residents are happy about the economic benefits it brings to their community.

Therefore, this study is undertaken to fill the gap by profiling the tourists and associating them with different tourism activities. A self-administrated questionnaire was distributed to tourists in Jakarta International airport and some tourist areas around Jakarta. Statistical analysis such as factor analysis, multiple linear regressions and descriptive analysis were employed in order to analyze the data. Results indicated the push factors behind choosing Indonesia for vacation and also different participated activities among tourists from different geographical origins. The findings of this study should be considered by tourism marketers and stakeholders while developing marketing strategies.

Objective: This study aims to identify factors affecting visitor’s satisfaction towards shopping facilities at international airport in Jakarta. Data was collected using survey technique, where questionnaire was distributed to 200 visitors at Terminal 2, Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. Results: The result of multiple linear regression analysis shows that physical environment of shopping facilities and personal factors of visitors have significant relationships and effect toward visitor’s satisfaction at the airport shopping facilities. The result also shows that café is the most visited outlet at the respective airport. Conclusion: The study indicates that physical environment contributes more than personal factors on satisfying visitors at airport shopping facilities. Nevertheless, both aspects should be of airport management’s concern. Airport management can consider doing refurbishment to the shops as well as forming effective marketing strategies to convey positive message to the visitors about airport shopping. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

The purpose of this paper was also to assess if there were gender differences in host communities towards educational tourism impacts. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was performed; the results demonstrated that there was a significant difference in gender on educational tourism impacts (p <.05). The findings suggest that further qualitative studies should be done in order to value social and cultural factors concerning host communities, gender differences and tourism industry in Malaysia.

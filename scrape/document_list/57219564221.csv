While buying furniture requires more consideration and is time-consuming, they tend to search for every information that they need on internet first, before taking further action of going to the physical store. Through the field research and interviews, it can be proven that customers in average need two or more trips before finally deciding to purchase. The proposed application is designed to help user find their way to the shop with a sufficient product knowledge and also reducing their consideration time to a faster purchase conversion. Augmented Reality will be used on the mobile application to let user see the color compatibility to the room and allow approximate size measuring. This is done by using a specific target size as a comparison to real life object size. Small size usability testing was conducted to several user, and the final result received great feedback as it was easily understood, self-explanatory and aided user to make decision faster. Eventually, the aim is that when the furniture arrives, customer will feel satisfied as a conclusion of their furniture purchase journey. © 2020 IEEE.","Augmented reality; Furniture shop; User experience","Augmented reality; Information management; Color compatibility; Customer experience; Mobile applications; Mobile augmented reality; Physical stores; Product knowledge; Usability testing; Younger generations; Sales",,,,,"The authors would like to recognize tremendous support towards the improvement of this research shown by BINUS University s RTTO department.","Morgan, I., Rao, J., Making routine customer experiences fun (2003) MITSloan Management Review; Lissitsa, S., Kol, O., Generation x vs generation y-a decade of online shopping (2016) Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services; Angus, A., Westbrook, G., Top 10 global consumer trends (2019) Euromonitor International: London, UK; Faulds, D., Mangold, W., Raju, P., (2017) The Mobile Shopping Revolution: Redefining the Consumer Decision Process, , Kelley School of Business, Indiana University; Nunkesser, R., Beyond web/native/hybrid: A new taxonomy for mobile app development (2018) 2018 IEEE/ACM 5th International Conference on Mobile Software Engineering and Systems; Pouryousef, S., Rezaiee, M., Chizari, A., Let me join two worlds! analyzing the integration of web and native technologies in hybrid mobile apps (2018) 2018 17th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications/12th IEEE International Conference on Big Data Science and Engineering, IEEE; Scholz, J., Smith, A., Augmented reality: Designing immersive experiences that maximize consumer engagement (2016) Business Horizons, 59 (2), pp. 149-161; Chylinski, M., Heller, J., Hilken, T., Keeling, D., Augmented reality marketing: A technology-enabled approach to situated customer experience (2020) Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy; Brengman, M., Willems, K., Kerrebroeck, H.V., Can't touch this: The impact of augmented reality versus touch and non-touch interfaces on perceived ownership (2019) Virtual Reality, 23 (3), pp. 269-280; Yussof, M.F., Salleh, S.M., Ahmad, A.L., Augmented reality: A systematic literature review and prospects for future research in marketing and advertising communication (2019) Intelligent and Interactive Computing, pp. 459-473. , Springer, Singapore; Chen, E.Y., Enrichr: Interactive and collaborative html5 gene list enrichment analysis tool (2013) BMC Bioinformatics, 14 (1), p. 128; Eisenman, B., (2015) Learning React Native: Building Native Mobile Apps with JavaScript, , O'Reilly Media, Inc; Scholz, J., Smith, A., Augmented reality: Designing immersive experiences that maximize consumer engagement (2016) Business Horizons, 59 (2), pp. 149-161; Bach, B., The hologram in my hand: How effective is interactive exploration of 3D visualizations in immersive tangible augmented reality?

To get a description of the structural behavior starting from the structure in linear elastic, the first yielding of the structural elements until the structure collapse due to earthquake load, it can be done with non-linear static analysis namely pushover analysis. In this study, the geometry of mid-rise reinforced concrete structure consists of four storey buildings. The dimensions of the column structure 400x400 mm and beam structure 250x500 mm, where the dimensions of the beams and columns are the same from the 1st floor to the 4th floor. To find out the behavior that affects the ductility value in mid-rise reinforced concrete structures, a variation material used in this study are the spacing of stirrup, ratio of longitudinal reinforcement, ratio of compressive and tensile longitudinal reinforcement, and compressive strength of concrete. Structural geometry modeling, structural loads, and modeling of material variations used the program SAP 2000. From the output of this program, an analysis of the value of curvature ductility and displacement ductility was performed. The result of this study are the higher the value of compressive strength of concrete and the ratio of longitudinal reinforcement in beam structure will increase the value of ductility. The smaller the value of the spacing of stirrup and the ratio of longitudinal reinforcement in column structure will increase the value of ductility. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Curvature Ductility; Displacement Ductility; Pushover","Compressive strength; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Ductility; Earthquakes; Floors; Prestressed beams and girders; Static analysis; Structural analysis; Compressive strength of concrete; Curvature ductility; Displacement ductility; Longitudinal reinforcement; Non-linear static analysis; Pushover; Strength and stiffness; Structural behaviors; Reinforced concrete",,,,,"Arslan, M.H., Estimation of curvature and displacement ductility in reinforced concrete buildings (2012) KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering, 16 (5), pp. 759-770; (2012) Seismic Evaluation and Retrofit Rehabilitation of Existing Buildings, , American Society of Civil Engineers 41-13; Bengar, H.A., Abdollahtabar, M., Shayanfar, J., Predicting the ductility of RC beams using nonlinear regression and ANN (2016) Iranian Journal of Science and Technology, Transactions of Civil Engineering, 40 (4), pp. 297-310; Bruneau, M., Building damage from the Marmara, Turkey earthquake of August 17, 1999 (2002) Journal of Seismology, 6 (3), pp. 357-377; (2005) Improvement of Nonlinear Static Seismic Analysis Procedures, , Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 440; (2013) Persyaratan Beton Struktural Untuk Bangunan Gedung, , Badan Standardisasi Nasional; Karantoni, F.V., Bouckovalas, G., Description and analysis of building damage due to Pyrgos, Greece earthquake (1997) Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering, 16 (2), pp. 141-150; Mondal, A., Ghosh, S., Reddy, G.R., Performance-based evaluation of the response reduction factor for ductile RC frames (2013) Engineering Structures, 56, pp. 1808-1819; (2012) Tata Cara Perencanaan Ketahanan Gempa Untuk Struktur Bangunan Gedung Dan Non Gedung, , Badan Standardisasi Nasional; (2013) Beban Minimum Untuk Perancangan Bangunan Gedung Dan Struktur Lain, , Badan Standardisasi Nasional; Whittaker, A., Hart, G., Rojahn, C., Seismic response modification factors (1999) Journal of Structural Engineering, 125 (4), pp. 438-444; Zhou, J., He, F., Liu, T., Curvature ductility of columns and structural displacement ductility in RC frame structures subjected to ground motions (2014) Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering, 63, pp. 174-183","Hidayat, I.; Civil Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: irpan@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

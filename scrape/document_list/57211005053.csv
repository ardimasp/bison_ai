During 16 years of service in fulfilling the citizens' need of transportation, Transjakarta is considered to have a fairly good performance, remarked with the addition of 13 corridors until renovation of the bus fleets. In the era of Jakarta Smart City, Transjakarta is now available at citizens' service. The connected transport application (X), which was renowned as the official partner for Jakarta Smart City, is a route-finding application which can be downloaded freely in the citizen smartphone. It has some features which facilitates the users in gaining the information about Transjakarta, such as locating the station nearby, navigating bus position, and looking at bus schedule. X itself, is already implemented in the transportation system of four big cities in Europe (Berlin, London, Prague, and Vilnius). To investigate whether the existence of this application really affects Transjakarta passengers, we have performed a survey-based research by visiting the largest and the busiest Transjakarta station at Harmoni, in the capital. The Transjakarta passengers are interviewed to get an information about how effective X in providing information about Transjakarta. As the result of this research, the respondents are divided into three groups: those who know X and using it, those who know X, but don't use it, and those who don't know about X at all. © 2020 IEEE.","Connected transport; Indonesia; Mobile application; Passengers; Transjakarta","Information management; Smart city; Bus fleets; Indonesia; Mobile applications; Public transportation; Route findings; Survey-based research; Transport applications; Transportation system; Buses",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

The methods may vary for each university, but most of the modern universities today use a Learning Management Systems (LMS). The LMS application is widely used by the lecturers and students of Bina Nusantara University called BINUMAYA. The system was originally created as a website application, but now its mobile version is also available and is widely used by amongst the students and the lecturers. However, the existing student version of the mobile application have two separate applications, that function almost identically with the official BINUMAYA system. We are interested in finding out the students' perceptions about the two applications. Therefore, we ran a user survey on BINUS students that were randomly selected by convenience sampling. Respondents were asked several questions related to performance, trustworthiness and preferability using the applications. The data collected was analysed using the two mean difference tests for each variable. Our findings showed that the students have a few reasons on why they prefer to choose one application compared to the other and, why they only trust the information presented by the official mobile LMS. © 2020 IEEE.","E-Learning; Learning Management System; Mobile LMS; Student Preference","Information management; Students; Learning management system; Mean difference test; Mobile applications; Mobile Learning; User surveys; Learning systems",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

This study analyzes the correlation between the use of KM systems and the performance of hospital services, using independent-samples T-tests and ANOVA tests from SPSS and R Commander programs to prove the hypothesis of the two variables, namely the use of KM systems (capabilities) and hospital services performance. The results of this research have succeeded in proving that there are significant differences between medical personnel who rarely use the KM system and who often use it, with those who often have a greater level of service performance. Thus, it can be concluded that the KM system used by hospital has a positive effect seen in the performance of medical personnel. © 2019 IEEE.","hospital; KM System; services performance","Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Personnel; Hospital service; Independent samples t tests; Km systems; Knowledge management system; Level of Service; Medical personnel; Pilot projects; services performance; Hospitals",,,,"Binus University","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research supported by the Grant from PDUPT and Bina Nusantara University (BINUS).","Gusman, I., (2013) Pointers Ketua DPD RI Dalam Seminar Asosiasi Rumah Sakit Daerah, , http://www.irmangusman.com/sambutanketua-dpd-ri-dalam-seminar-asosiasi-rumah-sakit-daerah/, September 3 Retrieved Februari 14 2019; Wibisono, S., (2013) Kasus Malpraktek di Indonesia, , http://www.tempo.co/read/news/2013/03/25/058469172/Terjadi-182-Kasus-Malpraktek-di-Balikpapan, Maret 25 Retrieved Januari 23 2019; Gold, A.H., Malhotra, A., Segars, A.H., Knowledge management: An organizational capabilities perspective (2001) Journal of Management Information Systems, 18 (1), pp. 185-214. , Summer; Faust, B., Schweiz, N., (2015) Implementation of Tacit Knowledge Preservation and Transfer Methods, , http://www.fraserhealth.ca/media/Implementation-of-Tacit-Knowledge-Presevation-and-Transfer-Methods.pdf, Retrieved Mei 12; Bennet, A., Bennet, D., (2004) Organizational Survival in the New World: The Intelligent Complex Adaptive System, , Boston: Elsevier; (2010) Knowledge Management and Information.

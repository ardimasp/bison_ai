The objective of this research is to seek the possibility of replacement current monitor using eye ergonomic and human factor analysis. The research are backed up with three theories of Fitts's Law, Horopter Theory, and Westheimer's Saccadic Eye Movement Model. Fitts Law used to illustrate the general powers and faults of humans and machines. Horopter used to match another distinctive of our visual ergonomic: the placement of surfaces of monitors. Saccadic eye movements used to describe the express movements of eyes with monitor shape. The survey was conducted to operators seeking possibility to use curved monitor to replace the flat monitor. The researcher used simulator for Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) and its training movies and asking the participant doing the experiment then filling up questionnaires. Participants will be selected from the panel DCS operator doing their job in oil, gas and petrochemical manufacturing plants. The questionnaires are analysed by Rasch Model Analysis, to seek the benefit of curved monitor than flat monitor. Rasch analysis to find internal test reliability and conclusion out the each item analysis on visual ergonomic and human factor interaction. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The views that arise are views that come from various backgrounds of shareholder members and property stakeholders who are in the circle of residential property supply chain, including property owners and everyone who becomes working and in touch with the property business itself. The data obtained from qualitative and quantitative research give a lot of understanding and input to see the role of CSR and the relation of the performance of property company organization in Indonesia which is generally incorporated in Real Estate Indonesia membership (REI). Property firms provide data representing owners and supply chain properties with careful observation of the company’s CSR activities. The fundamental findings found by the researcher is the existence of adequate understanding level of CSR, and still the scarcity of CSR program organizing in the property company that researched causing CSR in the property industry has not got big impact when compared with CSR done in other industries such as mine, oil and gas. In the future, the contribution of CSR is expected to be greater and more effective and have an impact in building the property especially the housing that can be reached by the wider community including informal sector along with the financing scheme which is not convoluted and can fulfill the backlog of public housing which is getting bigger from year to year. © 2019 IJSTR.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Housing; Informal sector; Organizational performance; Property; Shareholder; Stakeholder; Supply chain",,,,,,,"Pérez, A., Del Rodríguez Bosque, I., Salazar, J., Husted, B.W., Biehl, M., (2012) Measuring CSR Image: Three Studies to Develop and to Validate a Reliable Measurement Tool., , Journal citation; Salazar, J., Husted, B.W., Biehl, M., (2012) Thoughts on the Evaluation of Corporate Social Performance Through Projects., , Journal citation; Drucker, P.F., (2001) Management Challenges for the 21st Century, , Harper Business, New York, USA.

As the leader, whoever should be accountable is not only on the horizontal level and at the vertical level as well. Phenomenological studies and literature about the practice of leadership are faced with a number of theories about leadership and then synthesized into more whole leadership rather than just to brand a leadership itself. Based on the assumption a leader is merely a sociological problem that needs to be completed with a spiritual dimension, while in its historical development of leadership, it is never excluded from the spiritual dimension. This article concludes that self-giving as a spiritual dimension in leadership will give more benefit to develop the life system as well as the purpose of leadership itself rather than the apparent leadership, which actually hurts or even manipulate the members for the sake of egoistic the leader and their inner circle. Therefore, it is very important for education to teach self-giving as a spiritual dimension to all students of the World, especially in Asia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Sports; Historical development; Education",,,,,,"Freeman, G.T., Spirituality and servant leadership.

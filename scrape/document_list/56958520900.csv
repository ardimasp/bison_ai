Without exception, the development of chatbot for the hotel receptionist tasks also demands a massive training dataset. Unfortunately, laborious effort and hefty time are needed to manually collect a dataset with that size. Therefore, an information system is needed to assist the dataset collection. In regards to solve the problem, this research contributes in developing the information system that enables a massive data collection for training a hotel receptionist chatbot in a reasonable time. In detail, the contribution of this research are twofold: (1) developing a realiable crowdsourcing information system design to collect and store the dataset for training hotel receptionist chatbot; and (2) developing a user experience that can stimulate the crowdworkers to provide more data. © 2020 IEEE.","Chatbot; Crowdsourcing; Data collection; Hotel receptionist chatbot","Crowdsourcing; Deep learning; Hotels; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Metadata; User experience; Chatbot; Massive data; Peak performance; Training dataset; Data acquisition",,,,,,"Adiwardana, D., (2020) Towards A Human-like Open-domain Chatbot; Zhou, L., Gao, J., Li, D., Shum, H.-Y., The design and implementation of xiaoice, an empathetic social chatbot (2020) Comput.

In the process, the utilization of ICT in language teaching has not comprehensively embraced for the level of digital literacies and the different context of universities. This research aims to explore the level of digital literacies at the universities and distinct context of General English (GE) teaching in two private universities in Jakarta. In this frame, the research describes the category of ICT implemented and the relevant aspects of the lecturers in both universities to teach General English. In supporting this, a triangular method of data collection is applied in the research. Technically, a questionnaire consisting of closed and open questions was distributed to lecturers from both universities. The data is analyzed qualitatively based on percentages indicator. The result revealed that the respondents have a good level of digital literacy. However, they lacked some knowledge and skills in managing the classes in an online platform. As a result, the research contributes to providing training to support them in coping with the need for teaching GE with accepted digital literacy. © 2019 ACM.","Digital; ELT; ICT; Lecturers; Literacy","Artificial intelligence; Data collection; Digital; Digital literacies; Higher education; Jakarta; Lecturers; Literacy; Online platforms; Teaching",,,,"Binus University","Thank you to the Bina Nusantara University for the supported grant.","Toro, U., Joshi, M., Ict in higher education: Review of literature from the period 2004-2011 (2012) International Journal of Innovation, Management and Technology, 3 (1), pp. 20-23; Shelomovska, O., Sorokina, L., Romaniukha, M., Bohomaz, K., Nakaznyi, M., (2016) ICT-Competence of University Teachers in Professional Development and Scientific Activity; Habib, H., Ghulam, B., Role of ict in higher education (2017) International Journal of Creative Research Thoughts (IJCRT), 5 (4); Jamwal, A., Shekhar, C., Alam, S., Religious commitment and paranormal beliefs across gender and educational stream (2016) The International Journal of Indian Psychology, 3 (3), p. 129; Adeoye, Y.M., Oluwole, A.F., Blessing, L.A., Appraising the role of information communication technology (ict) as a change agent for higher education in Nigeria (2013) International Journal of Educational Administration and Policy Studies, 5 (8), pp. 177-183; Agrawal, A.K., Mittal, G.K., The role of ict in higher education for the 21st century: Ict as a change agent for education (2018) Multidisciplinary Higher Education, Research, Dynamics & Concepts: Opportunities & Challenges for Sustainable Development, 1 (1), pp. 76-83; Kern, R., (2000) Literacy and Language Teaching, , Oxford University Press; Hafner, C.A., Chik, A., Jones, R., (2015) Digital Literacies and Language Learning; Heitin, L., (2016) What Is Digital Literacy, , https://www.edweek.org, Education Week.

Using Neuro research method, the study collects and analyse data using a literature review. The researchers explain the implementation of technology in education and how the educational system in Indonesia support the needs. The study reveals that technology and online learning is required and relevant for teaching in Indonesian context because it is the characteristics of the students in the generation. However, there are some challenges including the skills of teachers in technology and in pedagogy, the management of technology that answered the needs of students, and the system that encounters a problem because it is government-centred (central policy in the curriculum). Regarding online learning, there is no specific regulation for the implementation of online learning in secondary education. The recommendation is related to the system and legal support of the government to develop the online learning implementation in secondary school. © 2019 IEEE.","curriculum; online learning; secondary education; technology","Curricula; Engineering education; Students; Educational systems; Industrial revolutions; Literature reviews; Management of technology; Online learning; research methods; Secondary schools; Technology in educations; E-learning",,,,"Binus University","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research is supported by Binus University Grant.","Kaur, M., Blended learning-its challenges and future (2013) Procedia-Soc.

In this line, GoJek is one of the most famous Online Transportation Companies (OTC). As this backdrop, early research reported that single female used the Online Transportation System frequently. In the other angle, passenger's safety, especially for female passenger, has become issues. In this scope, several new findings reported the victim of female passengers. From that lesson, National Police advises the OTC to perform the physiological test for the driver due to security concern. Therefore, the research explored the relationship between the risk factor of the online transportation system for female passenger. In this study, SPSS is used to find the correlation bivariate function and to explain how extent the correlation of risk factor with the passenger background is. In this frame, the research involved 408 respondents of female customer online transportation passenger. Ultimately, fourteen significant correlations are obtained between respondent background and risk factor.

The research emphasized on UKBI-Uji Kemahiran Berbahasa Indonesia (Test of Indonesian Language Proficiency). In this context, testing of foreign language tests such as Bahasa Indonesia increasingly plays a prominent role in Indonesia because every foreign worker is required to qualify certification of Indonesian language proficiency at the standardized level. The requirement complies with Regulation of the President of the Republic of Indonesia No. 20, 2018. This study aims to propose the development of Indonesian language proficiency test for foreign speakers. The initiative of development contributes to foreign learners' improvement beneficially. In this vein, it measures the ability of test-takers and then hones the language skills according to the description of the test results of the skills. This qualitative research involved 28 foreign students at BINUS University. This research revealed that the program accommodated students' learning development plan effectively, especially the skills of Indonesian language. In addition, this test will assist the stakeholders such as the Indonesian government, foreign learners, teaching associations of BIPA (Indonesian for Foreign Speaker) and activists, and BIPA teachers in long term eventually. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Ability testing; Websites; Development plans; Experimental development; Foreign language; Foreign students; Indonesian languages; Qualitative research; Tools for testing; Web based; Students",,,,"Binus University","This research was supported by Bina Nusantara University.","Bayrak, T., Akcam, B., Exploring Benefits of a Web-based Testing and Training Tool (2015) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 195, pp. 1032-1041; Mustakerov, I., Borissova, D., A conceptual approach for the development of the educational Web-based e-testing system (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 38, pp. 14060-14064; Stephens, D., Bull, J., Wade, W., Computer-assisted Assessment: Suggested guidelines for an institutional strategy (1998) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 23 (3), pp. 283-294; Ricca, F., Tonella, P., Analysis and testing of web applications (2001) Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Software Engineering IEEE Computer Society, pp. 25-34; Arora, A., Sinha, M., Web application testing: A review of techniques, tools, and state of art (2012) International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, 3, pp. 1-6; Donley, B., Offutt, J., (2009) Software Engineering, , (George Mason University) Web Application Testing Challenges; Di Lucca, G.A., Fasolino, A.R., Testing Web-based applications: The state of the art and future trends (2006) Information and Software Technology, 48 (12), pp. 1172-1186; Romero, C., Ventura, S., De Bra, P., Using mobile and web-based computerized tests to evaluate university students (2009) Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 17 (4), pp. 435-447; Reips, U.D., Web-based methods (2006) Handbook of Multimethod Measurement in Psychology, pp. 73-85","Oktriono, K.; Language Center, Jl.

One of the challenges derives from either productive or receptive skills. In accordance with productive skill, this study aims to determine the forms of error in the speaking practice of international students in Bina Nusantara (BINUS) University in 2017-2018 through Online UKBIPA application. In this scope, UKBIPA represents the proficiency test of Indonesian language for international students in BINUS University. The research method is qualitative based-research with content analysis techniques. The data of this study contains the utterance of the practical speaking of international BIPA students transcribed in complete sentences. Based on the analysis of 175 sentences in the form of BIPA students' speech, the results obtained 72 phonological errors (40%), 43 lexical errors (25%), 22 semantic errors (13%), and 38 grammatical errors (22%) in student speech. The results of this study benefits for the development of BIPA materials, especially for speaking skill; the development of BIPA speaking method; development of evaluation tools and speaking tests of BIPA; and refinement of the Online UKBIPA Binus test application. The study concludes that the major error in speaking practice of BIPA appeared in phonological errors.

Presumably, a demand emerges in assessing students’ achievement by using technology. In language teaching learning, it is undeniable that the technology is also applied in assessing students’ language skills including writing. In assessing writing, in a common type, the process is carried out manually or typed in a word document. Based on the results, this research aims to explain the development of an integrated multimedia website for assessing writing and the potential of using the website for writing test. Questionnaires were distributed to 28 students joining English Professional Course at BINUS Online Learning to evaluate the promptness of the website for the test and the students’ sense of the website functionality. The result denoted that the website contribution is well-equipped to use as a tool and to test the writing skill. Moreover, the users were comfortable to exert it for undertaking the writing test. Equally important, the developments on the website require continuous improvement, especially for the variation of the questions including to add video and audio integration eventually. © 2018 ACM.","ESL; Integrated-multimedia; Technology; Website; Writing test","E-learning; Surveys; Teaching; Websites; Continuous improvements; High technology; Integrated-multimedia; Language teachings; Online learning; Teaching-learning; Word documents; Writing skills; Students",,,,"Binus University","The study is supported by BINUS University Grant.","Yunus, M., The use of information and communication technology (ict) in teaching esl writing skills (2013) English Language Teaching, 6 (7). , http://edtech2.boisestate.edu/williamstewart287/512/module5/assets/TheUseOfICTInTeachingWritingYunusetal2013.pdf, 2013.

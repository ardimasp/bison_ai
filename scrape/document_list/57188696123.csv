This study aims to obtain scientific data about the nutritional value of fresh and boiled eel meat. The analysis included proximate and cholesterol content. Analysis performed on eel meat included proximate analysis (AOAC), and cholesterol level analysis (Liebermann-Buchard Color Reaction). The experimental design applied in this study was an independent T-Test analysis to compare the mean of the two groups unrelated to 5% significant level. The parameters measured were Proximate Composition (Moisture, Ash, Fat, Protein, Carbohydrate), and Cholesterol level. The results showed that boiling process of eel meat significantly affected the decrease in protein, fat, carbohydrate, and cholesterol levels. Decreased levels of fat due to the influence of heat during the boiling process followed by a decrease in cholesterol. Cholesterol levels of fresh eel meat was 68,96 ? 0,40 mg/100 g decreased to 65,06 ? 0,36 mg/100 g after boiling. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbohydrates; Cholesterol; Environmental technology; Functional food; Meats; Nutrition; Proteins; Boiling process; Cholesterol content; Cholesterol levels; Nutritional value; Proximate analysis; Proximate compositions; Scientific data; T-test analysis; Thermal processing (foods)",,,,,"We cordially thank to Bina Nusantara University for the support in facilitating and funding this research through the research grant 2018 managed by RTTO (Research and Technology Transfer Office).","Aberoumand, A., Proximate composition of less known some processed and fresh fish species for determination of the nutritive values in Iran (2012) J. of Agricultural Technology, 8, pp. 917-922; Affandi, R., Strategi pemanfaatan sumberdaya ikan sidat Anguilla spp. di Indonesia [in Bahasa] (2005) J.

The purpose of this study was to assess and evaluate the effect of Pluchea indica Less leaf extract and chlorine to the hematological profile of broilers. The experimental design applied in this study was completely randomized design (CRD) with 5 treatments and 4 replications. The treatments were as follows T0: Basal feed without adding Pluchea indica Less leaf extract and chlorine; T1: Basal feed + 2% Pluchea indica Less leaf extract + 30 ppm chlorine; T2: Basal feed + 4% Pluchea indica Less leaf extract + 20 ppm chlorine; T3: Basal feed + 6% Pluchea indica Less leaf extract + 10 ppm chlorine; T4: Basal feed + 8% Pluchea indica Less leaf extract + 0 ppm chlorine. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) at the level of 95%, when the result was significant, means were separated by Duncan’s multiple range tests. The values were considered significant if P<0.05. The parameters measured were: number of erythrocytes, hematocrit, hemoglobin levels, number of leukocyte, and difference in leukocytes (lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils) in broilers. Increased level of Pluchea indica Less leaf extract along with decreased level of chlorine showed significant result (P<0.05) to leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, hemoglobin. On the other hand, the results for eosinophils, erythrocytes, and hematocrit were not significant (P>0.05). In conclusion, Pluchea indica Less leaf extract at the level of 8% was able to replace chlorine and also able to increase the number of leukocytes, hemoglobin levels, percentage of lymphocytes, and monocytes in broilers. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2015.","Blood profiles; Broilers; Chlorine; Pluchea indica less leaf extract",,,,,,,"Aengwanich, W., Pornchai, S., Yupin, P., Thevin, V., Parwadee, P., Suporn, K., Suchint, S., Effects of ascorbic acid on cell mediated, humoral immune response and pathophysiology of white blood cell in broilers under heat stress (2003) Songklanakarin J.

In general, research leads to a combination of pre-processing and training models. Therefore, this study aims to classify low-resolution face images using a combination of pre-processing and deep learning. In addition, this study also aims to compare evaluation results based on differences in epoch values. In this research will use the Trunk Branch Ensemble - Convolutional Neural Network (TBE-CNN) as one of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture combined with the pre-processing method which is super resolution to get better accuracy compared to the state-of -art. Then the model is trained with different epoch values, that is 40 and 100, to comparing the best classification. This study was evaluated by YTD Dataset. Based on the test results, this proposed method has achieved better results compared to the previous method, which gives an increase of 1%. After that, training results from different epoch values used produce different accuracy at the training model but have no effect on validation and testing model. The training using epoch = 100 has an accuracy increase of 3% compared to training using epoch = 40 and the loss ratio obtained at the training is decreased by 20% compared to training at epoch = 40. Furthermore, optimization parameters used and reducing computing time when training models and validation will be future research. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

The e-voucher is used as a flight ticket payment instead of cash payment to buy a ticket. The e-voucher consists of some attributes such as destination, flown date, and flight class. Particularly, a marketing manager needs to review the utilization of e-voucher when a ticket has been approved in every year. The proposed solution is to redeploy existing OLTP database into data warehouse. The data warehouse already developed using nine-step Kimball’s methodology. All data will be analyzed using OLAP to present a report in a visual form such as dashboard. Furthermore, airlines company can produce an analysis report using business intelligence. © IAEME Publication","Business Intelligence; Data Warehouse; ETL; Pentaho System; Reporting",,,,,,"Al-Debei, M.M., Data warehouse as a backbone for business intelligence: Issues and challenges (2011) European Journal of Economics, Finance and Administrative Sciences, 33; Watson, H.J., BI-based Organizations (2010) Business Intelligence Journal, 15 (2); Xiao, B., Cheng, G., (2015) The Research Of Teradata Data Warehouse Technology, , IEEE; Parra, V.M., Mohammad, A., Syed, A., Halgamuge, M.N., Pentaho and Jaspersoft: A comparative study of business intelligence open source tools processing big data to evaluate performances (2016) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 7 (10); Chung, P.-T., Chung, S.H., (2013) On Data Integration and Data Mining for Developing Business Intelligence, , IEEE; Tarnaveanu, D., Pentaho Business Analytics: A business intelligence open source alternative (2012) Database Systems Journal, 3 (3). , III,. 2012,. 3; Tutunea, M.F., Rus, R.V., Business intelligence solutions for SME's (2012) International Conference Emerging Markets Queries in Finance and Business, , Romania; Data warehousing as a healthcare business solution (1998) Healthcare Financial Management: Journal of The Healthcare Financial Management Association, 52 (2), pp. 56-59. , S.

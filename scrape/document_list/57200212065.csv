The evaluated exertion in the UCP method gets from the increase between the UCP esteem and the Effort Value (ER). The expense of ER is the extent of structure of working hours required for each utilization. Determination of ER values only uses data software development projects with simple linear regression analysis. However, most researchers refer to the proposed ER value without questioning or reviewing the ER value. This study evaluates the ER values for software development projects in the business field, namely the Health Surveillance Application. In conducting this research, we need several data on software development projects in the Health Surveillance field from this data. We can find the ER value by analyzing correlation and linear equations. The final results of this study get the benefit of ER 8.0. This price is lower than the quantity suggested by past scientists. Decreasing the ER value can reduce the estimated amount of the effort, then the decrease in estimated business value will reduce the resources needed for software development. May be due to a development project as a component or framework that facilitates project developmen, this is possible for several reasons, including more advanced software engineering technology, rapid growth. © 2019 IEEE.","health surveillance application; Size of software; software metrics; use case point","Application programs; Computer aided software engineering; Health; Monitoring; Regression analysis; Business value; Development project; Health surveillances; Simple linear regression analysis; Software development projects; Software metrics; Use case points; Working hours; Software design",,,,,,"https://www.maxmanroe.com/ini-penyebab-kegagalan-startupmenurut-dua-tokoh-startup-indonesia.html; Group, S., (2011) Reports of Chaos, , http:/standishgroup.com/news, Accessed on 1 June 2013; Tokey, Steve, Steve, (2010) Software Return: Maximizing Your Software Investment Return, , Prentice-Hall; Galorath, D., Evans, M.W., (2008) Sizing Software, Estimate, and Risk Management, , Auerbach, in; Endy, M., (2011) Estimated Project of Software, , http:/software.endy.muhardin.com/estimate-probesoftware/, Retrieved March 7, 2013; Ochodek, M., Nawrocki, J., Kwarciak, K., (2011) Simplifying Estimation Effort Based on Use Case Points, , Sciencedirect; Karner, G., (1993) Resource Estimation for Objectory Projects, , Objective System SF AB; Clemmons, R.K., (2006) Use Case Point Project Estimation, , Technical Services Diversified, Inc; https://mx.123dok.com/document/7q01eggzsoftware-projects-effort-estimation-using-use-case-points-method-in-the-context-of-project-management-bodyof-knowledge, Retrieved from; http://elearning.upnjatim.ac.id/courses/REKAYASAPERANGKATLUNAKPAGI/document/slidekuliah/Software_Process_Model_1.ppt?cidReq=REKAYASAPERANGKATLUNAKPAGI, Accessed on July 12, 2013; Robiola, G., Ricardo, O., (2008) Using Case to Early Estimate Effort with Simpler Metrics, , Springer publishing house London Limited; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_Case_Points#Unadjusted_Use_Case_Weight_(UUCW)_2",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","4th International Conference on Informatics and Computing, ICIC 2019","23 October 2019 through 24 October 2019",,157590,,9781728122076,,,"English","Proc.

The admissibility of digital evidence depends on sever-al factors, including improper handling, virus infection, deliberate tampering, or faultyhardware that might compromise its integrity. The integrity of digital evidence is highlydependent on use of a cryptographic hash function to provide a seal on the evidence. Inthis paper, we analyze the causes of evidence inadmissibility to the courts, specifically dur-ing a chain of custody in which the evidence is passed from one investigator to another,and therefore is at risk of compromise. We introduce a confidence level of admissibility toidentify the percentage of trust accorded to evidence. When the level of integrity is intact,then the confidence level of admissibility is 100%. For evidence under investigation, theconfidence level is reduced as the changes have been made to the documents. We proposea framework for establishing the confidence level of evidence admissibility. Based on thisframework, we construct a model that enables the calculation of the confidence level ofadmissibility, from which we can produce a history log for document traceability. © 2019, ICIC International.

Although formal study on weather forecasting has been started since 19th century, research attention to weather forecasting tasks increased significantly after weather big data are widely available. This paper proposed merged-Long Short-term Memory for forecasting ground visibility at the airpot using timeseries of predictor variable combined with another variable as moderating variable. The proposed models were tested using weather timeseries data at Hang Nadim Airport, Batam. The experiment results showedthe best average accuracy for forecasting visibility using merged Long Short-term Memory model and temperature and dew point as a moderating variable was (88.6%); whilst, using basic Long Short-term Memory without moderating variablewasonly (83.8%) respectively (increased by 4.8%).

The emerging deep learning techniques in the last decade coupled and the wide availability of massive weather observation data have motivated many researches to explore hidden hierarchical pattern in the large volume of weather dataset for weather forecasting. The purposes of this research are to build a robust and adaptive statistical model for forecasting univariate weather variable in Indonesian airport area and to explore the effect of intermediate weather variable related to accuracy prediction using single layer Long Short Memory Model (LSTM) model and multi layers LSTM model. The proposed forecasting model is an extension of LSTM model by adding intermediate variable signal into LSTM memory block. The premise is that two highly related patterns in input dataset will rectify the input patterns so make it easier for the model to learn and recognize the pattern from the training dataset. In an effort to achieve a robust model for learning and recognizing weather pattern, this research will also explore various architectures such as single layer LSTM and Multiple Layer LSTM (4 layers LSTM). The dataset is weather variable data collected by Weather Underground at Hang Nadim Indonesia airport. This research used visibility as predicted data and temperature, pressure, humidity, dew point as intermediates data. The best model of LSTM in this experiment is multiple layers LSTM and the best intermediate data is pressure variable. Using the pressure variable this model has gained the validation accuracy 0.8060 and RMSE 0.0775. © 2018 The Authors.

One of the important weather data in aviation is visibility. Visibility is an important factor in all phases of flight, especially when the aircraft is maneuvering on or close to the ground, i.e., during taxi-out, takeoff and initial climb, approach and landing and taxi-in. The aim of these study is to analyze intermediate variables and do the comparison of visibility forecasting by using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Model. This paper proposes ARIMA model and LSTM model for forecasting visibility at Hang Nadim Airport, Batam Indonesia using one variable weather data as predictor such as visibility and combine with another variable weather data as moderating variables such as temperature, dew point and humidity. The models were tested using weather time series data at Hang Nadim Airport, Batam Indonesia. This research compares the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) resulted by LTSM model with the RMSE resulted by ARIMA model. The results of this experiment show that LSTM model with/or without intermediate variable has better performance than ARIMA Model. © 2018 Afan Galih Salman, Yaya Heryadi, Edi Abdurahman and Wayan Suparta.","Autoregressive integrated moving average; Long Short-Term Memory; Root mean square error; Visibility; Weather forecasting",,,,,"Binus University","This research is supported by Doctoral of Computer Science, Bina Nusantara University.","Afshin, S., Fahmi, H., Alizadeh, A., Kaveh, F., Long term rainfall forecasting by integrated artificial neural network-fuzzy logic-wavelet model in Karoon basin (2011) Scientific Res.

The same utilizes augmented reality (AR) technology and a cloud marker recognition system and allows creations of unique marker for each player without the need to do an update every time. Aetherpet is a virtual pet game designed to become a prototype in implementing augmented reality technology in mobile gaming. This application is developed for the Android platform and Vuforia library. The marker image generated from the application is converted into features; that can be detected on a grayscale marker image. The prototype result shows that augmented reality is possible to be implemented. There are only small restrictions on the implementation such as incompatibility of some features and requirement for a reliable server to handle the game information processing. © 2015 The Authors.

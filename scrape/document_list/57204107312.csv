The alignment of the implementation of information technology systems to the needs and goals of the organization will be able to be answered by taking into account the integration in the development, so that the gap of these two things can be minimized. As a company engaged in IT consulting, project management system is one form of application systems that support core business objective of the company: to produce high-quality software. Nevertheless, the project management system should be able to work together with other supporting information systems, so that the flow of information within the company can run effectively. To achieve these objectives, required the analysis and design of an integrated system, which can be achieved through a service-oriented architecture based system. which includes the stages of requirements and analysis, design and development, and the last is the IT operations. The final result expected is the design of the service-oriented architecture based project management system which built through top-down approach that focuses on improving the effectiveness of business process. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Application programs; Computer architecture; Information services; Project management; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Application architecture; Application systems; Business objectives; Design and Development; High-quality software; Information technology systems; Project management system; Top down approaches; Information management",,,,,"Hurwitz, J., Bloor, R., Baroudi, C., Kaufman, M., (2007) Service Oriented Architecture for Dummies, , (United States: Wiley Publishing); Schwalbe, K., (2015) Information Technology Project Management, 8. , (United States: Course Technology); Kerzner, H., (2013) Project Management: A System Approach to Planning, Scheduling, and Controlling, 11. , (United States: John Wiley amp; Sons, Inc.); Burke, R., (2003) Project Management: Planning and Control Techniques, 4. , (United Kingdom: John Wiley amp; Sons, Ltd); Rosen, M., Lublinsky, B., Smith, K.T., Balcer, M.J., (2008) Applied SOA: Service-Oriented Architecture and Design Strategies, , (Indianapolis: Wiley Publishing, Inc.); Rosen, M., Use Context Diagrams to Bridge from Value Streams to Processes and Services (2013) A BPTrends Column, , Oct; Kaplinsky, R., Morris, M., (2001) A Handbook for Value Chain Research; (2008) Reference Architecture for Service Oriented Architecture, , OASIS",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","International Conference on Computation in Science and Engineering, ICCSE 2017","10 July 2017 through 12 July 2017",,140021,17426588,,,,"English","J.

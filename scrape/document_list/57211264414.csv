More and more jobs, increasingly complex work environment, the demands of the times, accuracy and speed of work require auditors inevitably must adopt technology. This research began with our success as academics in the audit family. Related to Indonesia, a large country and has several hundred public accounting firms and thousands of auditors, but computerized use of audits using software is still very little. The public accounting firm still uses a manual system, using normally typed paperwork. We want to find out what can boost the use of software among auditors. Our results are useful for auditors in Indonesia. From the results of statistical tests we found that auditors use compilation software by individual auditors themselves rather than organizations and individuals © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

This research uses a technology acceptance model approach that is expanded with the influence of organizational, social and individual factors. Object of this study is external auditors who work in public accounting firm in Jakarta Special Capital Region. In this research we use system usage as dependent variable, while perceived usefulness as intervening variable 1, and perceived ease of use as intervening variable 2. We use organizational factor, social factor and individual factor as independent variables. The results show that both intervening variables have impact on dependent variables, while organizational factor has no impact on both intervening variables, social factor only affect the intervening variable 1 and individual factor affect both intervening variables. © 2019 IEEE.","assisted; auditor; computer; factor; perception; technique","Acceptance tests; Computers; Information management; Sensory perception; assisted; auditor; factor; Independent variables; Organizational factors; Perceived ease of use; technique; Technology acceptance model; Economic and social effects",,,,,"Davis, F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance (1989) MIS Q., 13 (3), pp. 319-339; Kim, H.J., Mannino, M., Nieschwietz, R.J., Information technology acceptance in the internal audit profession: Impact of technology features and complexity (2009) Int.

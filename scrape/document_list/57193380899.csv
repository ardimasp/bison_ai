Knowledge Management enables organizations to collect, store, distribute, and reuse the knowledge that a company's assets have. Likewise in the area of education, knowledge management has now evolved to be easier to deploy. Many colleges have tried to figure out how to use social computing to collaborate with educators and students in knowledge management. The most frequent problem of knowledge management is the willingness of the user to use or distribute it. The collaboration and communication aspects of social computing or web 2.0 is the basic successful use of knowledge management. The purpose of this study is to define and analyze how social computing can be utilized in knowledge management and implemented by the organization so that the purpose of knowledge management can be achieved. This research used TAM to measure the technology acceptance to 60 respondents, as the result all variables are correlated and has influence to the actual use. © 2020 IEEE.","Knowledge management; Social computing; Web 2.0","Social networking (online); Students; Actual use; Indonesia; Internal development; Jakarta; Technology acceptance; Web 2.0; Knowledge management",,,,,,"Shanmugam, M., Sun, S., Amidi, A., Khani, F., Khani, F., The applications of social commerce constructs (2016) Int.

To imagine the severances of it, 10.000 KM of highway can be built with that much amount of fund. Several responses has been done by Indonesian government to fight corruption from both prevention and persecution. This work focuses on the development of a web application aimed to provide insight to corruption case per province in Indonesia. The web application was developed using Machine Learning, specifically Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Web crawling and web scraping techniques are used to gather news content from 7 major news portal in Indonesia. Accuracy is measured by comparing correct prediction by ANN to its true value. Upon finding corruption news, data is saved and further analysis is done to establish the number of corruption news per region. Finally, the output is visualized using Google Map API. The purpose of this work is to provide regional depiction of corruption case to give further insight to be used by decision makers. Upon using this web application, objectivity of program development is expected to increase. The final output of the web application is a map of corruption case in Indonesia per region.

It analyses KMS using factor analysis to determine the factors influencing user awareness of KM Portal. Research is done through questionnaire on 275 respondents to collect data on KM Portal. The study showed that three factors influenced user awareness for KM Portal, 1) quality of KM Portal content and features; 2) admin and company participation; 3) user participation. All factors produced a model that can be used for the calculation of user awareness of KM Portal. It also showed that in terms of data processing, the current state of KM Portal is barely sufficient. Thereby suggesting that the company can increase user awareness of KM Portal by improving the three factors mentioned. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Evaluation; Factor analysis; Knowledge; Knowledge management system; User awareness",,,,,,,"Chung-Hung, T., Hwang-Yeh, C., Assessing knowledge management system success: An empirical study in Taiwan's high-tech industry (2007) Journal of America Academy of Business, 10 (2), pp. 257-263; Eftekharzadeh, R., Knowledge management implementation in developing countries: An experimental study (2008) Review of Business, 28 (3), pp. 44-58; Fong, P.S.W., Choi, S.K.Y., The processes of knowledge management in professional service firms in the construction industry: A critical assessment of both theory and practice (2009) Journal of Knowledge Management, 13 (2), pp. 110-126; Juan-Gabriel, C., Cepeda-Carrión, G., How to implement a knowledge management program in hospital-in-the-home units (2010) Leadership in Health Services, 23 (1), pp. 46-56; Keiser, B.E., Building communities through knowledge management (2013) Online Searcher, 37 (5), pp. 16-21; Keiser, B.E., Knowledge management at GE and CCH (2013) Online Searcher, 37 (4), pp. 20-22; Maier, R., (2007) Knowledge Management System: Information and Communication Technologies for Knowledge Management, , (3rd Ed.)

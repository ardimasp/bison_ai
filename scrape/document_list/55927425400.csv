However, the effective implementation of AHP for decision making in industries still becomes a question. This research aims at developing a systematic literature review using the real cases implementing AHP, both in manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries, from 2000 to 2020. To obtain research results, we select seventy-eight cases and utilize AHP combined with other methods. The results of this study show that twenty-two scientific works of literature combine AHP with other methods. GIS method and Expert choice software are the most frequently implemented methods combined with AHP. The finding of this study is expected to be a reference and recommendation for researchers or practitioners in using AHP in various industries. © 2020 EManuscript Technologies.

Quantity Discount Pricing Integrated Newsvendor Model (this term will further be called as Extended Newsvendor) was examined then having its performance compared with subjective method which has already been used by the companies. The comparison was done to discover which method is able to reduce the potential shortage of supplies, total cost of each unit, age of inventory, and order frequency. Extended Newsvendor method was chosen to be examined in the first place due to its assumption which was deemed suitable with the actual condition that is encountered by the companies, where the demand happens stochastically, and quantity discount pricing policy is applied. The calculation that utilizes 5 years of the company historical data, this research find that the Extended Newsvendor method is generally able to improve the performance of the order quantity medium-sized companies but is unable to improve the performance of the order quantity of small-sized companies. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Age of inventory; Newsvendor; Order frequency; Quantity discount",,,,,,"The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest during the process of the research and writing of this manuscript.

They provide warning signs and also give feedback to help the government take required measures to improve its performance. In the public sector, it is difficult to measure the output as services provided do not have a price which would indicate their value to the community. Outputs, such as education services, are provided free or at a subsidized price. One of the public sectors in Indonesia which is very important to be measured for its productivity is public schooling. This study is one of the first efforts in looking at the feasibility of constructing productivity measures for Indonesian public schools. The method and model used in measuring Public School productivity is modified. Data used are secondary data available from several government sources. The study has been positive and has produced some interesting and meaningful results. Public school productivity in Indonesia has improved overall since 2011 and the improvement is getting better still, since 2014. But these improvements are not enough and are still lagging behind several ASEAN countries. The policies and programs need to be analyzed and evaluated in such a way that there is improvement in the overall education productivity and education quality. It is important that measures will be improved by involving stakeholders in the productivity measurement study. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Goods and services; Government policies; Inputs; Productivity measures outputs; Public sector outputs; Resources",,,,,,,"Andrews, D., Criscuolo, C., Gal, P.N., (2016) The Best Versus the Rest: The Global Productivity Slowdown, Divergence across Firms and the Role of Public Policy (OECD Productivity Working Papers, 2016-05), , Paris, France: OECD Publishing; Atkinson, A.B., The Atkinson review: Final report (2005) Measurement of Government Output and Productivity for the National Accounts, , Basingstoke, England: Palgrave Macmillan; (2017) Report on Government Services 2017, , https://bsllibrary.org.au/general/report-government-services-rogs-2017-productivity-commission-79753/, Canberra, Australia: AGPC.

This study aims to determine the effect of interactivity between operators and their customers as well as the influence of interactivity on the service quality of mobile operators. The sub-variables used for the interactivity (as independent variables) include control activities, interactivity responsibilities and non-verbal interactivities information. Quality of service is treated as a dependent variable. Sampling was conducted using the non-probability purposive sampling technique. Regression analysis showed that the quality of service is strongly influenced by the interactivity responsibilities sub-variable. On the other hand, the non-verbal interactivities information sub-variable had the least influence. The results indicate interactivity responsibility is considered to be the variable providing most influence on service quality, while the least influencing variable is the nonverbal information interactivity variable. The determination factor is 52.8%, meaning that interactivity is just 52.8% of the required variables for influencing the quality of services, while the rest, which is 47.2%, is another variable that is not covered in the model. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Control activities;

When changes happen, employees need to adapt to the work environment and this can influence many aspects of employees’ working life. The performance of employees will influence the performance of an organisation and one of the factors that influences employee performance is employee motivation. The changes can be through communication and culture differences. Television broadcasting service companies must focus on their human resource because they employ a large number of workers. There are 19 major television companies in Indonesia. The broadcasting industry is one of the pioneers of private television stations in Indonesia. Media Citra Nusantara owns RCTI, Global TV and iNews TV. The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of organisational communication and organisational culture on employee motivation and its impact on employee performance in the broadcasting industry. The method of data collection used in this study is the questionnaire. Questionnaires were distributed to 300 employees. The data analysis method used in this study is path analysis.

They are symbiotically associated with bacteria of the genera Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus, respectively. Mainly, media development of EPNs as biological control agents is directed towards cost reduction, and it is possible for a variety of protein sources to be metabolised by the bacteria for optimal conditions for nematode reproduction. The aim of this research is to examine the LC50 with leaf disc assays at concentrations of 0.01, 0.10, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 ppm using TUREK® (Bt var aizawai), BITE® (Bt var aizawai) and THURICIDE® (Bt var kurstaki) on larvae of P. xylostella (n=180). The results from the field trial clearly indicated that the biocontrol agent B. thuringiensis (Bt) is superior to the chemical insecticide. B. thuringiensis is accepted as safe, readily mass produced, highly susceptible and easily formulated and applied as biological control agents for sustainable agriculture. Recent scientific progress has been helpful in providing better understanding of the biological and technical parameters that influence the process, thus enabling transfer of knowledge and application to industry. As a consequence, costs for nematode-based products can be significantly reduced. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Biological control; Economic sustainable development; Entomopathogenic nematodes; Mass production; Symbiotic bacteria",,,,,"Oktatási és Kulturális Minisztérium: MP3EI","This contribution is dedicated to the Ralf-Udo Ehlers laboratory team who created a friendly and productive environment that contributed to the success of this research.

It also aimed to examine the relationship between EO and student inclination toward entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional survey was conducted targeting students at Indonesian universities. Using a pilot sample of 65 students, the authors developed their hypotheses. Thereafter, based on a sample of 381 students, the hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. Findings - The findings revealed that EO in the Indonesian context was a three- factor instrument consisting of the three dimensions: risk-taking, innovativeness and proactiveness. Moreover, the findings showed there is a positive relationship between EO and Entrepreneurial Intention (EI) among business students at Indonesian universities. Practical implications - Given the imperative need for universities to monitor and improve the entrepreneurial spirit among business students, this study can help business students to understand better regarding the business attitude they need to maintain, which can help them to improve proactive personality and formulate effective business strategies in the future. Originality/value - This paper came to be one of the first studies that attempted to assess the EO among business student in Indonesia using AMOS-SEM. Additionally, this study pioneered through drawing a factorial picture for EO in the Indonesian context.","Business studentsr; Entrepreneurial intention; Entrepreneurial orientation; Structural equation modeling",,,,,,,"Amrullah, A., (2012) Mayoritas Lulusan Perguruan Tinggi tak Tertarik Jadi Wirausahawan, Kok Bisa?, , http://www.republika.co.id/berita/nasional/umum/12/03/03/m0aira-mayoritas-lulusan-perguruan-tinggi-tak-tertarik-jadi-wirausahawan-kok-bisa, Accessed 13 May 2015; (2015) Jumlah pengangguran terbuka Indonesia 7,24 juta, , http://nasional.kontan.co.id/news/jumlah-pengangguran-terbuka-indonesia-724-juta, Accessed 13 May 2015; (2015) Jumlah Pengusaha Indonesia Hanya 1,65 Persen, , http://www.republika.co.id/berita/nasional/umum/15/03/12/nl3i58-jumlah-pengusaha-indonesia-hanya-165-persen, Accessed 13 May 2015; (2013) Sekjen Kemenakertrans Muchtar LuthfiMembuka Forum Inkubator Bisnis Asia Pasific di Bandung, , http://bbppk-lembang.com/view_news_detail-152-sekjen-kemenakertrans-muchtar-luthfi-membuka-forum-inkubator-bisnis-asia-pasific-di-bandung.aspx, Accessed 25 May 2015; Astuti, D.A.W., (2009) Pengaruh Konteks Keluarga, Kerja, Pendidikan, Hambatan Dalam Memulai Bisnis, Dukungan Sosial, Nilai-Nilai Individualisme dan Kolektivisme Pada Intensi Berwirausaha, , working paper, Management Department, Universitas Sebelas Maret, 19 October; Begley, T.M., Boyd, D.P., Psychological Characteristics Associated with Performance in Entrepreneurial Firms and Smaller Businesses (1987) Journal of Business Venturing, 2 (1), pp. 79-93; Bentler, P., Comparative fit indexes in structural models (1990) Psychological Bulletin, 107 (2), pp. 238-246; Bentler, P., (2005) EQS 6 Structural Equations Program Manual, , Multivariate Software, Encino, CA; Bentler, P.M., Bonett, D.G., Significance tests and goodness of fit in the analysis of covariance structures (1980) Psychological Bulletin, 88 (3), pp. 588-606; Bolton, D.L., Lane, M.D., Individual entrepreneurial orientation: development of a measurement instrument (2012) Education + Training, 54 (2-3), pp. 219-233; Brislin, R.W., Translation and content analysis of oral and written materials (1980) Triandis: Handbook of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 2. , J.

This shows the low use of SFA by the SF. This paper is aimed to evaluate SFA implementation by using Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use Technology (UTAUT) model approach.

The research was conducted on three main materials required in producing spring and sponge mattresses. Using Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model to analyze historical demand on main materials, it is proven that with EOQ model the company can save by more than 45% from procuring and inventory costs of those materials. The research continues to forecast the sales demand to get the annual requirement of materials needed in 2014 and calculate the EOQ model again. The results show that, comparing with traditional practice done by company, EOQ model can reduce costs up to 118 million rupiah per year. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

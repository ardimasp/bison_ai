Runners track their activities to know their progress and help them achieve their goals. One of the alternatives to monitor is through a fitness application which has also become a platform for runners to connect with their friends. As a running shoes manufacturer, XYZ Company wanted to help runners monitor their time, distance, pace, and calories burned while running. In addition, the company also wanted to support the running communities to grow bigger. This thesis project aimed at developing an Android-based application that provides feedback on users' activities while they are running, as well as features that lets them connect with their friends. Moreover, users are also able to schedule a run, compute their heart rate, and run with their friends. The application was developed using Java and utilized Google Maps API and Firebase. An application unit testing as well as unit acceptance testing both to users and client were performed to ensure that the application functions properly. The testing showed a satisfactory result and several recommendations for future development were also proposed. To conclude, the application was able to deliver all the client's requirement and achieve the aim of this thesis project. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt. Ltd.

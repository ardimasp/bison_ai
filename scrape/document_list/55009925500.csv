The disasters which have actually happened in West Papua require considerable attention and consideration of the Indonesian Government, despite since they have handled as much as they can to provide solutions and make people feel secure and pleasant. The purpose of this study is to calculate the location-based social vulnerability in West Papua involves the components of Information, Technology, and Communication, Food Access, Natural Disaster, Social Protection Statement, Access to Financial Services, Description of the source of household income, Number of event floods, number of earthquake disasters, COVID-19 death cases, and Number of incidents of protest which are obtained from the National Socio-Economic Survey (SUSENAS) official statistics with the main focus of research on the millennial generation. After employ clustering of variables around latent variables with connectivity value of 3.9400794, Dunn 0.9373, and Silhouette 0.6333. Each factor provide a sign indicating a positive or negative effect on social vulnerability and finally a location cluster will be formed based on the index obtained. © 2013 IEEE.","Latent cluster; millennial; natural hazard; non-natural hazard; social hazard; vulnerability","Disasters; Location based services; Surveys; Earthquake disaster; Financial service; Household income; Latent variable; Natural disasters; Official Statistics; Social vulnerability; Socio-economics; Hazards",,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST: MOST-107-2221-E-324-018-MY2

Since fashion is the most favorite item category in Indonesia, there are lots of fashion e-commerce grown in the country. One of the unsatisfactory conditions that are occurred in fashion e-commerce in Indonesia is user drop off. By using funnel analysis, the product detail page of fashion e-commerce founded as the page with the most user drop off. To tackle this problem, several experiments were prepared. With A/B testing, the experiments that possibly improved the conversion rate were identified.

COVID-19 was since being the headlines of the news offline and online. This trigger either positive or negative responses from the readers, which in turn affect at least the depth of understanding and furthermore the effectiveness of any enforced intervention taken with the purpose to control the transmission of the COVID-19. In order to assess how likely the COVID-19-containing news being forwarded to reach more readers and how the pertinent news bridge further virtual interaction, we crawled data from Twitter as the major online microblogging platform to analyze how likely COVID-19-containing tweets were echoed and what typical tweet about COVID-19 that gained attentions. This is critical to evaluate how people virtually responded against the tweets. Our analyzed data is visualized using Matplotlib by Python and Graph Prism8 accordingly. We figured out that timing and number of followers are not determinative for the tweets being retweeted. Instead, provoking headline add likelihood for the tweets to be moving forward. Also appeared in our analysis that the top two media (Detik and Kompas) shared the same proportion on their tweet type fractions on where information dominated the fraction of their tweets. © 2020 IEEE.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Retweet; Tweet; Twitter","Electronic assessment; Information management; Coronaviruses; Indonesia; Micro-blogging platforms; Offline; Virtual interactions; Social networking (online)",,,,,,,"Adhikari, S.P., Meng, S., Wu, Y., Mao, Y., Ye, R., Wang, Q., (2020) Epidemiology, Causes, Clinical Manifestation and Diagnosis, Prevention and Control of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) during the Early Outbreak Period: A Scoping Review, pp. 1-12; (2020) Novel Coronavirus-Japan (Ex China), , https://www.who.int/csr/don/17-january-2020-novel-coronavirusjapan-ex-china/en/, Accessed 9 April 2020; (2020) COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic, , https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/, Worldometer.

However, many young adults suffer poor sleep due to work or academic demands. Even more, sleep is associated with stress which is many young adults experienced it. To solve this problem, many epidemiologic studies suggest that exercise may improve sleep quality. On the other hand, several studies show that daily activity has no association with sleep quality. In this study, we tried to find more evidence of whether the daily activity has an association with sleep quality or not. We used a commercially available wearable device to capture the subject's heart rate, step count and deep sleep duration for 7 months. Then we used linear regression, XGBoost, and Long Short-Term Memory to find an association between these variables. The results show that there was no association between these variables. © 2020 IEEE.","Heart rate; Physical activity; Sleep quality; Step count; Wearable device","Information management; Wearable technology; Daily activity; Epidemiologic-study; Heart rates; Mental health; Sleep quality; Wearable devices; Young adults; Sleep research",,,,,,,"Watson, N.F., Recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult: A joint consensus statement of the American academy of sleep medicine and sleep research society (2015) Sleep; Engle-Friedman, M., The effect of sleep loss on next day effort (2003) J.

The limited carrying capacity of land in the supply of nutrients must be balanced with the addition of nutrients through fertilization. Ideally, the application of fertilization is site specific, but it is unfortunate that the cost constraints cause location-specific fertilization doses cannot be obtained immediately. The purpose of this study is to develop an Android-based fertilizer application to simulate the availability and loss of nutrients in the care or cultivation of oil palm. The Hydrometer method was used to carry out soil structure analysis. Data on the amount of nutrients stored and released from fertilizer applications was modeled with the help of the stock and flow diagram method. The stock and flow diagram method was used to determine the effect of the amount of fertilizer introduced on nutrients stored in the main crop and the large amount of fertilizer that was evaporated, runoff, and deviated. Furthermore, this method was able to predict the amount of nutrition during fertilization (1 semester). The results of this study are in the form of an Android-based application which is compiled based on the calculation scheme obtained from the Stock and Flow Diagram. © 2020 IEEE.","Fertilizer loss; Precision agriculture; Soil","Android (operating system); Fertilizers; Flowcharting; Information management; Palm oil; Runoff; Calculation scheme; Cost constraints; Fertilizer applications; Growth and development; Large amounts; Nutrient elements; Site-specific; Soil-structure analysis; Nutrients",,,,,,,"Suwarno, D.P.P., Technosol tanah masa depan (review) (2018) AGROISTA Jurnal Agroteknologi, 2 (1), pp. 93-107. , https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.34083.71208; Saragih, D.P.P., Ma'As, A., Notohadisuwarno, S., Various soil types, organic fertilizers and doses with growth and yields of stevia rebaudiana bertoni m (2019) Jurnal Ilmu Pertanian, 3 (1). , https://doi.org/10.22146/ipas.33176; Pahan, I., (2011) Panduan Lengkap Kelapasawit Manajemen Agribisnis Dari Hulur Hingga Hilir, , Bogor: Penebar Swadaya; Arsyad, A.R., Junedi, H., Yulfita, F., Pemupukan kelapa sawit berdasarkan potensi produksi untuk meningkatkan hasil tandan buah segar (tbs) pada lahan marginal kumpeh (2012) Jurnal Penelitian Universitas Jambi Seri Sains, 14 (1), pp. 29-36; Haryanti, A., Norsamsi, P.S.F., Sholiha, N.F., Studi pemanfaatan limbah padat kelapa sawit (2014) Konversi, 3 (2), pp. 20-29; De Datta, S.K., Advances in soil fertility research and nitrogen fertilizer management for lowland rice (1987) Efficiency of Nitrogen Fertilizer for Rice, pp. 27-41. , Manila: International Rice Research Institute; Bimantio, P.M., Effect of grain size and activation time of zeolite to adsorption and desorption of nh4oh and kcl as model of fertilizer-zeolite mix (2017) Jurnal Konversi, 6 (2), pp. 20-27; Bimantio, P.M., Saragih, D.P.P., Benefisiasi prarancangan proses pengolahan pupuk granul slow release Dari urea dan zeolit (2018) PROSIDING SEMINAR INSTIPER TAHUN 2018 Perkembangan Penelitian INSTIPER Dalam Menanggapi Era Teknologi Maju Bidang Perkebunan i, pp. 103-115. , A.

Over time, the case fell in line with the increasing number of patients recovering. In addition, different views between elements of government make people surrender and believe in the power of nature's creator. Under these conditions, the researchers were interested in learning more. The study was conducted using a descriptive analysis of a number of parties regarding economic and social activities. The results show that there are three important components: First, trust builds the creator and reduces to the government component, communication that a number of parties do not work consistently when responding to COVID-19, and enforcement of unclear rules. In a nutshell. The citizens, grouped into two groups, agree that a pandemic is dangerous and urge them to follow values in the form of existing rules. Also,The pandemic communication competes in a short time and therefore cannot be carried out interactively.The government’s assertiveness of forcing residents to be at home becomes difficult as compensation can be granted for lost opportunities to seek family income Lastly, due to the preparation of the strategy that precedes the arrival of a pandemic, it cannot be face wisely. © 2020 Lifescience Global","Attitude; Citizens; COVID-19; Indonesia; Pandemic",,,,,"Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia, KPM

Hence, researchers have begun to put significant efforts into studying the direct and indirect benefits of wearable devices for health and wellbeing. This paper summarizes recent studies on the use of consumer wearable devices to improve physical activity, mental health, and health consciousness. Methods: A thorough literature search was performed from several reputable data-bases, such as PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, arXiv, and bioRxiv mainly using “wearable device research” as a keyword, no earlier than 2018. As a result, 25 of the most recent and relevant papers included in this review cover several topics, such as previous literature reviews (9 papers), wearable device accuracy (3 papers), self-reported data collection tools (3 papers), and wearable device intervention (10 papers). Results: All the chosen studies are discussed based on the wearable device used, complementary data, study design, and data processing method. All these previous studies indicate that wearable devices are used either to validate their benefits for general wellbeing or for more serious medical contexts, such as cardiovascular dis-orders and post-stroke treatment. Conclusions: Despite their huge potential for adoption in clinical settings, wearable device accuracy and validity remain the key challenge to be met.

One of the most important coffeepre-processing, coffee bean roasting, is under developed in Indonesia. Indonesia coffee farmers prefer to use the traditional cauldron to roast their coffee beans. Roasting coffee beans using traditional cauldron is inefficient and resulting unequal roasted level for the coffee beans. In this study, we proposed atemperature control system based on fuzzy logic for coffee roaster machine. The system controls the temperature in accordance with the demanded roasting level. A thermal camera is attached inside the roasting chamber to monitor the heaton the roasted coffee beans.

Because this fish is known to have higher albumin fraction (64.61%) of protein and other economic values, domestication, and cultivation of this fish has been done in many Asian countries such as Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, and India. Environmental factors such as temperature, water pH, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, and turbidity are important parameters must be considered inbreeding and growing this type of fish. The aim of this paper is to propose an IoT solution to automatically monitor these environmental factors. It is designed with affordable and open-source electrical components to provide a cost-efficient solution for farmers. Five sensors are used to measure each parameter. A web application prototype is also presented as a companion application for the users to get useful information from the IoT device. It is developed using a Pythonframework. By accessing this web application, the users can immediately detect any abnormal conditions of the pond. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cultivation; Dissolved oxygen; Fish; Lakes; Abnormal conditions; Asian countries; Economic values; Electrical components; Environmental factors; Freshwater bodies; Total dissolved solids; WEB application; Internet of things",,,,,,,"Haniffa, M.A.K., Jeya Sheela, P.A., Kavitha, K., Jais, A.M.M., Salutary value of haruan, the striped snakehead Channa striatus - A review (2014) Asian Pac.

That is, given these advances, many such studies now consider evaluating an extremely large number of genetic markers (p) genotyped on a small number of subjects (n). Given the dimension of the data, a joint analysis of the markers is often fraught with many challenges, while a marginal analysis is not sufficient. To overcome these obstacles, herein, we propose a Bayesian two-phase methodology that can be used to jointly relate genetic markers to binary traits while controlling for confounding. The first phase of our approach makes use of a marginal scan to identify a reduced set of candidate markers that are then evaluated jointly via a hierarchical model in the second phase. Final marker selection is accomplished through identifying a sparse estimator via a novel and computationally efficient maximum a posteriori estimation technique. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach through extensive numerical studies, and consider a genome-wide application involving colorectal cancer. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

With current computational power and algorithm, it is possi-ble to process big data, especially biomedical data, to find a complicated pattern with reasonable computation time. Computational approach for phosphorylation site prediction is more time-efficient and need fewer resources compared to traditional. However, the accuracy of current computational methods for phosphorylation site prediction still needs to be improved. This paper aims to create a computational method for phosphorylation site prediction with better classification performance compared to previous studies. The data used in this research to train the XGBoost models are extracted features from 2 different databases from the previous studies. The test result show that our model gave the highest accuracy on 4 out of 6 datasets. To extend our research, the XGBoost model was retrained which focused on 100 most important features from previous experiment. However, the result does not imply that it has a better result compared to our first models. As the result showing that our models gave better accuracy compared to the previous studies in most of the datasets, we can conclude that XGBoost model is better in predicting phosphorylation sites compared to other methods. © 2020 the author(s).","Gradient tree boosting; Phosphorylation; Post-translational modification; Prediction; Protein sequence; Proteomics; XGBoost",,,,,"Binus University","This research is a collaboration between the Department of Computer Science, University of Lampung, and Bioinformatics and Data Science Research Center (BDSRC), Bina Nusantara University.

The nature of dietary patterns of specific Indonesia population on the risk of colorectal cancer might differ from previously published data with the global population. Therefore, we conducted a study where the dietary pattern in colorectal cancer patient cohorts was compared to age- and population-matched control. We documented 89 colorectal cancer cases and among 173 individuals from the South Sulawesi population. A series of logistic regression and Fisher’s exact tests were utilized to test associations of dietary intakes and colorectal cancer risk as well as colorectal cancer staging. Our data demonstrate that vegetable (p-value = 8.70 × 10−26, OR = 0.49) and fruit (p-value = 7.59x10−5, OR = 0.70) intakes are associated with the reduced risk of colorectal cancer incidence. Conversely, acidic food, reheated food, meat, spicy food, and alcohol are associated with the increment case of cancer. Moreover, meat intake (p-value &lt; 0.01) shows a significant association with cancer staging progression. Common dietary pattern is a determinant aspect to the colorectal cancer incidence as well as its staging progression. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,"Mundade, R., Imperiale, T.F., Prabhu, L., Loehrer, P.J., Lu, T., Genetic pathways, prevention, and treatment of sporadic colorectal cancer (2014) Oncoscience, 1 (6), pp. 400-406;

In this paper, we use support vector regression (SVR) with different kernels such as polynomial, sigmoid and RBF. At the same time, we employ genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and hybrid particle swarm optimization. SVR-GA are population-based algorithms that allow for optimization of problems with the search space that is very broad and complex. This property too allows genetic algorithms to jump out of the local area optimum. In contrast with SVR-PSO and SVR-HPSO they do not have the genetic operation. In PSO only use internal velocity and have the memory which is essential to the algorithm. In this paper we compare SVR-PSO, SVR-HPSO and SVR-GA by comparing the input from the correlation and ARIMA in rainfall data. It was found that the input using correlation provides better accuracy than ARIMA. © 2020, ICIC International.

The third-party collected the data from twelve vascular centres in Indonesia during 2012-2017. Patient demographics and computed tomography data were evaluated with Osirix MD Software. During five years, we had 148 EVAR cases done using Endurant stent graft (Medtronic). In this paper, we perform Bayesian modelling and selection of feature selection by Boruta. Before performing the models, we will determine the selection of dependent variables start with the Age, Class, and Sex. It will get what is important to be dependent and independent. The difference between Bayesian and the classical method is the introduction of prior information in the form of probability distributions. In addition, to determine the parameters using the Bayesian method obtained from the probability statement. Parameter estimation in Bayesian is no longer a point estimate but, on the contrary, is a statistical distribution. In other words, Bayesian states that a parameter is a variable that has a distribution. Bayesian has become a popular method in modern statistical analysis. Bayesian is applied to a broad spectrum in the scientific and research fields. Bayesian data analysis involves learning from data that uses probability models for many observations and some information to be studied. In other words, analysing statistical models are by combining prior knowledge about the model or parameters of the model. In a nutshell, the simulation results obtained modelling with Bayesian-ZIP-MCMC R2 87.52 and Bayesian-Boruta R2 88.28%. © 2020 the author(s).","Bayesian; Boruta; Feature selection; MCMC; Orta",,,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST","This paper is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.

We performed two different simulation-based on level species and genus with Poisson and negative binomial to subject-specific interpretations. Methods: In this work, we use variational approximation to estimate parameter in multivariate latent generalized linear model. Otherwise, overdispersed a count outcome exhibiting many zeros, above the amount expected under-sampling from a Poisson distribution. Results: Through simulation studies, species counts follows negative binomial, and genus counts follow Poisson distribution and the performance of this methods evaluate by Akaike information criterion (AIC), Akaike information criterion corrected (AICc), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Conclusion: While these two sets of latent class parameters might be meaningful in certain species counts and genus counts. © 2019 Camel Publishing House.

Its purpose was to determine the correlation between independent variables consisting of Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Attitude toward Using (AU) with dependent variable Behavioral Intention to Use (BIU). Data collection techniques were carried out by distributing questionnaires through group discussion forums. Respondents consisted of medical workers and health cadres both in Jakarta and Yogyakarta. Data were analyzed using correlation test and t-test. The results of the correlation test state that the correlation between PEU and AU is 0.30, which shows a weak correlation. Meanwhile, the correlation of PU and AU is 0.56, PEU and BIU is 0.41, and PU and BIU is 0.47, which are considered as moderate correlations. Finally, a strong correlation exists between AU and BIU. T-test results show that the effect of PU on AU is statistically significant with CI = 95%. Likewise, the effects of PEU on AU, AU towards BIU, PU towards BIU, and PEU towards BIU are significant (p < 0.05). © Kassel University Press GmbH.","Cancer early detection; Mobile learning; TAM",,,,,,,,"Dyanti, G.A.R., Suariyani, N.L.P., Faktor-Faktor Keterlambatan Penderita Kanker Payudara Dalam Melakukan Pemeriksaan Awal Ke Pelayanan Kesehatan (2016) Jurnal Kesehatan Masyarakat, 11 (2), pp. 96-104. , https://doi.org/10.15294/kemas.v11i2.3742; Muljo, H.H., Perbangsa, A.S., Pardamean, B., Assessment of Online Learning Application for Health Education (2019) International Journal of Online and Biomedical Engineering, 15 (12), pp. 69-80. , https://doi.org/10.3991/ijoe.v15i12.11157; Setiati, E., (2009) Waspadai Empat Kanker Ganas Pembunuh Wanita, Kanker Rahim, Kanker Indung Telur, Kanker Leher Rahim, Kanker Payudara, , https://doi.org/10.18860/sains.v0i0.1862, Yokyakarta: Andi; Fernández, M.E., DeBor, M., Candreia, J.D.M., Dissemination of a breast and cervical cancer early detection program through a network of community-based organizations (2010) Health Promotion Practice, 11 (5), pp. 654-664. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839908325064; Ngoc Nguyen, T.-U., Tanjasiri, S.P., Kagawa-Singer, M., Tran, J.H., Foo, M.A., Community Health Navigators for Breast-and Cervical-Cancer Screening Among Cambodian and Laotian Women: Intervention Strategies and Relationship-Building Processes (2008) Health Promotion Practice, 9 (4), pp. 356-367. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839906290251; Muljo, H.H., Pardamean, B., Perbangsa, A.S., The implementation of online learning for early detection of cervical cancer (2017) Journal of Computer Science, 13 (11), pp. 600-607. , https://doi.org/10.3844/jcssp.2017.600.607; Davis, F.D., Perceived Usefullness, Perceived Ease of Use, and User Acceptance of Information Technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3). , https://doi.org/10.2307/249008; Quinn, C., (2000) MLearning, , Mobile, Wireless, In-Your-Pocket Learning.

COVID-19 was first reported in Indonesia on March 03, 2020 then rapidly spread to all 34 provinces by April 09, 2020. Since then, COVID-19 is declared a state of national disaster and health emergency. This research analyzes the difference of CO, HCHO, NO2, and SO2 density in Jakarta, West Java, Central Java, and South Sulawesi before and during the pandemic. Also, this study assesses the effect of large scale restrictions on the economic growth during COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. In a nutshell, the results on Wilcoxon and Fisher test by significance level α=5% as well as odds ratio showed that there are significant differences of CO density in all regions with highest odds ratio in East Java (OR=9.07), significant differences of HCHO density in DKI Jakarta, East Java, and South Sulawesi. There are significant differences of NO2 density before and during public activities limitation in DKI Jakarta, West Java, East Java, and South Sulawesi. However, the results show that there are no significant differences of SO2 density in all regions. In addition, this research shows that there are significant differences of retail, grocery and pharmacy, and residental mobility before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. This research also shows that during the COVID-19 pandemic there are severe economic losses, industry, companies, and real disruptions are severe for all levels of life due to large scale restrictions. © 2020 GJESM.","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19); Economy; Environment; Indonesia; Odds ratio; Wilcoxon","carbon monoxide; COVID-19; economic growth; economic impact; environmental impact; epidemic; formaldehyde; nitrogen dioxide; respiratory disease; sulfur dioxide; viral disease; Indonesia; Coronavirus",,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST: 106-2218-E-324-002, 107-2221-E-324-018-MY2

For automation, an intelligent system needs to be developed. However, an intelligent system needs to be trained in a large dataset before it can be used reliably. In this paper, we present a transfer learning scheme to develop an intelligent system for smart building management system. Specifically, the intelligent system is able to count human inside a room, which can be utilized to adaptively adjust energy usage in a room. The transfer learning scheme employs a deep learning model that is pretrained on ImageNet dataset. To enable the human counting capability, the model is trained on a dataset specifically collected for human counting case. © 2019, The Author(s).","Building management system; Deep learning; Human counting;

Recommendation system plays a major role to formulate and produce a series of recommendation based on users' behavior. Surprisingly, user-generated scoring or known as ratings are the main raw materials to learn the pattern of favorable contents of each user. As a part of collaborative filtering strategy, rating is considerable to be included in formulating recommended contents. In this research, the basic formulation to recommend books is discovered. The recommendation system has been tested on one random-picked user behavior and successfully has generated five recommended books by analyzing prior activities. The embedding model produced the recommended books with 59% of accuracy.

The Academic Information System provides valuable raw data. However, unprocessed information alone is insufficient for the diagnosis of problem areas within an education institution. Due to the complex nature of educational management, there is a need for an application that can identify critical patterns and trends within an educational institution's current activities. The data warehouse in the study serves the center for data collection and integration. Gathered data can then be accessed for queries and analysis, generating insights crucial for improving an institution. The purpose of this study was to build a data warehouse model that can display useful information for education management support. The data warehouse design methodology was based on the nine-step methodology proposed by Kimball. The method of data collection included questionnaires, interviews, formal observations, and literature review. Visual Basic.Net 2008, SQL Server 2005 and Crystal Reports were used as tools to design the model. © 2018 IEEE.","data warehouse; education management; model; nine-step methodology","Data warehouses; Information use; Models; Pattern recognition; Surveys; Data collection; Education institutions; Education management; Educational institutions; Educational management; Literature reviews; nine-step methodology; Warehouse design; Data acquisition",,,,,,,"Pardamean, B., Muljo, H.H., Suparyanto, T., Masli, E., Prabowo, H., Donovan, J.D., Team based learning as an instructional strategy: A comparative study (2017) New Educ.

The development of online learning in supporting the success of health education programs for early detection of cervical cancer is the right solution to improve health workers knowledge. To measure user acceptance of the online learning applications, the study used Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) approach. Data collected from questionnaires then analyzed by calculating the frequency (proportion) of the total value, the interpretation of a score by looking for index% and interval. The final result of the calculation shows that all respondents agreed and strongly agreed with all four factors measured. The conclusions are the users believe that the use of learning online applications can reduce the task effort, improve job performance, give positive idea to use the technology, and consciously and expressed desire to run the online learning process in the future. © 2019 iJOE.","Cervical cancer; Early detection; Online learning; Technology Acceptance Model",,,,,,"This study was funded by a Competitive Grant of the Directorate of Research and Community Services of the Republic of Indonesia’s Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education.",,"Organization, W.H., ""Human papillomavirus and related cancers,"" (2010), Barcelona, Spain: WHO/ICO Information Centre on HPV and Cervical Cancer; Dwipoyono, B., Kebijakan pengendalian penyakit kanker (serviks) di Indonesia (2009) Indonesian Journal of Cancer, 3 (3), pp. 109-116; El Hajj, M.S., Hamid, Y., Breast cancer health promotion in Qatar: A survey of community pharmacists' interests and needs (2011) International Journal of Clinical Pharmacy, 35 (3), pp. 376-385. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11096-010-9449-y; Wootton, R., Bahaadinbeigy, K., Hailey, D., Estimating travel reduction associated with the use of telemedicine by patients and healthcare professionals: Proposal for quantitative synthesis in a systematic review (2011) BMC Health Services Research, 11, pp. 185-185. , https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-11-185; Means, B., Toyama, Y., Murphy, R., Bakia, M., Jones, K., (2009) Evaluation of Evidence-Based Practices in Online Learning: A Meta-Analysis and Review of Online Learning Studies, , Washington D.C: U.S Department of Education; Kaninnen, E., (2009) Learning Styles and E-Learning, Learning styles in virtual learning environments, , Tampere: Tampere University of Technology; Fry, K., E-learning markets and providers: some issues and prospects (2001) Education + Training, 43 (4-5), pp. 233-239. , https://doi.org/10.1108/eum0000000005484; Kirtman, L., Online versus in-class courses: An examination of differences in learning outcomes (2009) Teacher Education, 18 (2), pp. 103-116; You, J.W., Kang, M., The role of academic emotions in the relationship between perceived academic control and self-regulated learning in online learning (2014) Computers &Education, 77, pp. 125-133. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2014.04.018; Zimeras, S., Gortzis, L.G., Interactive tele-radiological segmentation systems for treatment and diagnosis (2012) International Journal of Telemedicine and Applications, 2012, pp. 1-15. , https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/713739; Chorbev, I., Sotirovska, M., Mihajlov, D., Virtual communities for diabetes chronic disease healthcare (2011) International Journal of Telemedicine and Applications, 2011, pp. 1-7. , https://doi.org/10.1155/2011/721654; Sorensen, C., Classrooms without walls: A comparison of instructor performance in online courses differing in class size (2014) MERLOT Journal of Online Learning and Teaching, 10 (4), pp. 569-576; Smith, S.B., Smith, S.J., Boone, R., Increasing access to teacher preparation: The effectiveness of traditional instructional methods in an online learning environment (2000) Journal of Special Education Technology, 15 (2), pp. 37-46. , https://doi.org/10.1177/016264340001500204; Gordon, M., Hodson, J., Kitchen, J., Lessons learned: Effectiveness of courses developed for aboriginal teacher candidates delivered at a distance (2014) International Journal of ELearning & Distance Education, 29 (2), pp. 1-24; Shonfeld, M., Ronen, L., Online learning for students from diverse backgrounds: Learning disability students, excellent students and average students (2015) The IAFOR Journal of Education, 3 (2), pp. 13-29. , https://doi.org/10.22492/ije.3.2.01; Fonolahi, A.V., Khan, M.G.M., Jokhan, A., Are students studying in the online mode faring as well as students studying in the face-to-face mode?

Protein phosphorylation is used to regulate various enzyme and receptor activations which include signal pathways. There have been many significant studies conducted to predict phosphorylation sites using various machine learning methods. Recently, several researchers claimed deep learning based methods as the best methods for phosphorylation sited prediction. However, the performance of these methods were backed up with the massive training data used in the researches. In this paper, we study the performance of simple deep neural network on the limited data generally used prior to deep learning employment.

Many people think that they have already met the suggested guidelines. However, most of them were wrong when they quantify their activity level using a personal activity tracker device. This problem indicates the need for personal physical activity tracker or wearable device to maintain the fitness level. However, as wide-range wearable devices available today, it is difficult to find the most suitable one regarding the price and quality. This paper proposes a study to explore the association between the quality and the price of the devices. The quality is evaluated by comparing the accuracy of the heart rate sensor and step counter of several wearable devices with the ground truth measurements. The test result is then analyzed using a series of statistical methods including, a paired t-test, Pearson's correlation test, and Bland-Altman plot. Both t-test and correlation coefficient is used to plot the association between quality and price. © 2019 The Authors.

In recent years, machine learning has gained significant attentions as a way to build a classifier from labeled data which also can be implemented to build a gender classifier. In this study we develop gender classifier using two different datasets with different languages, English and Bahasa Indonesia. Each data from both datasets is represented by 20 acoustic features. Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) is used to build the classification model using all these features and trained only on English dataset. This model is evaluated in both dataset to get the performance matrices consist of accuracy, AUROC, precision and recall. Ultimately, using this model we also identify and compare important features from both dataset to see the different characteristics of English and Bahasa Indonesia speeches. © 2019 The Authors.

It is also an important task which aimed to reduce the confounding by ancestry on the relationship of genotypes and disease risk in assocation studies. Several methods have been developed to generate the best ancestry estimated scores even though some of them are still facing inefficient computation time. In this paper, a combination method between KMeans clustering and PCA is proposed estimate ancestry estimation from SNP genotyping data. This method was compared with baseline model, called fastSTRUCTURE, in term of the quality of clustering and computation time. Public data from 1000 Genome project is used to train and evaluate the proposed model and the baseline model. The proposed model can successfully generate clusters with better accuracy than fastSTRUCTURE (91.02% over 90.39%). More importantly, it can boost the computation time until 100 times faster than fastSTRUCTURE (from 490 seconds to 4.86 seconds). © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, Air pollution is the presence of one or several contaminants in the outside atmospheric air such as dust, foam, gas, fog, smoke or steam in large quantities with various properties and time intervals of the contaminants in the air resulting in disturbances to the lives of humans, plants or animals. One of the parameters measured in determining air quality is PM2.5. However, PM2.5 has a higher probability of being able to enter the lower respiratory tract because small particle diameters can potentially pass through the lower respiratory tract. In this paper, we will get two different insight. First, the probability of status change using Markov chain and second, forecasting by using VAR-NN-PSO. More details we classify by three classifications no risk (1-30), medium risk (30-48), and moderate (&gt;49) in Pingtung and Chaozhou. This data is starting from January 2014 to May 2019 and it can be modeled with the Markov chain. At the same time, we perform Hybrid VAR-NN-PSO to forecast PM2.5 in Pingtung and Chaozhou. In this optimization, the search for best solutions is carried out by a population consisting of several particles. Based on the results of the discussion, opportunities for the transition from monthly status change are obtained continuous stochastic time with a stationary probability distribution. Regarding the VAR-NN-PSO, we obtained the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) 3.57% for PM2.5 data in Pingtung and 4.87% for PM2.5 data in Chaozhou, respectively. This model can be predicted to forecasting 180 days ahead. Besides, the population in PSO has generated randomly with the smallest value and the high value the accuracy. © 2019 CSIRO.

Scilicet, the Eurasian Plate, the Indo-Australian Plate, and the Pacific Plate. Therefore, Indonesia is part of the infamous volcanic zone called the”Ring of Fire” and one of the areas prone to natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, and landslides. This study aims to capture the spatial pattern and identify the causes of social vulnerability in the districts/cities in Indonesia using the biclustering method. The data is extracted from the Indonesian National Socio-Economic Survey (SUSENAS) by BPS-Statistics in 2014. The biclustering result indicates that each district/city has its own social vulnerability characteristics and shows that the vulnerable aspects of each district/city are different. The adjacent observations tend to have social vulenrability characteristics. The results of this study can be used as a reference for national disaster mitigation policy in Indonesia. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

These are known as polygenic models and are useful in evaluating risk of disease in patients. These models, however, often do not include important non-genetic factors that are important to the prediction of the disease. In this paper, we explore the prediction of colorectal cancer in Indonesia from non-genetic factors using common machine learning algorithms: XGBoost and Elastic Net. The result of this study identified 8 features with strong importance from both XGBoost and Elastic Net. We recommend including these features as covariates in future genetic association studies of colorectal cancer in Indonesia. Ultimately these models may be implemented as tools to screen patients for colorectal cancer risk. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The weather can accelerate and multiply the existence of various plant pests and diseases, accelerate the growth and development of grass among plants, and encourage the emergence of infection and significant damage to plants. The elements of climate that affect the growth of plants are one of them is rainfall. In this paper, we performed the simulation using the non-parametric penalized spline (PSPLINE) method and studied the effect on rice production in Lampung. It can be concluded that the increasing fluctuation, frequency, and intensity of climate anomalies in the last decade caused by the ENSO phenomenon have an impact on changes in distribution patterns, intensity, and period of the wet season so that the start of the rainy season and the dry season becomes too late. As a result, there is a seasonal shift from normal average conditions that can ultimately have severe implications for food crops. In a nutshell penalized spline gives high accuracy with R 2 = 96.227% and MAPE = 1.62%. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Also, Climate is one of the factors influencing the determination of cropping pattern in a region. Analysis of climatic characteristics in the determination of cropping pattern not only based on oldeman climatic classification. At the same time, the study of groundwater availability for plants and climogram of climatic elements is needed in determining planting schedule which is suitable for planting and determination of irrigation water supply, either the right amount of time. This study aims to identify and build spatial of the oldeman climate classification. It also determines the cropping pattern for seasonal crops based on the calculation of water balance and climogram (rainfall and air temperature) in each type of climate oldeman district of Cirebon and surrounding areas. Data used monthly rainfall data period 1981-2010 from BMKG Jatiwangi station and air temperature data, plant coefficient and the base map of Cirebon region. The analysis method includes classification of Oldeman climate type, spatial data processing, water balance calculation by Thorntwaite &amp; Matter method and making climogram (rainfall and temperature) with: k = p 0 + p 1 /FC; p 0 = 1.000412351; p 1 = -1.073807306 and determination of planting pattern of each type of oldeman. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

However, the implementation of these processes still faces obstacles, ranging from submitting legislation program until publication is still done manually and in hardcopy form. From the list of approved legislation, only a few people can access it. This is due to the lack of publication and limited access to the public. The study intends to develop a system model that manages the legislation process, from proposing legislation, harmonization, and publication.

Agriculture is also very strategic for national development because it absorbs 32 % of the labor market, the largest compared to the trade sector which is only 23 %, services as much as 16%, industry by 13% and construction around 5%. However, agriculture cannot be perceived as a sufficient livelihood for some farmers, which is indicated by a decline in the number of farmers by 1.1 % per year. Knowledge and information will be one of the important solution to the problem if it can be collected, accessed and implemented by farmers, so they can increase productivity, and sell high-value commodities. Agricultural Knowledge and Information System is a necessary instrument for that purpose because it is an efficient model of managing resources which will drive low cost model of operation and can be accessed anytime and anywhere. This study proposes an agricultural knowledge and innovation system model by conducting a literature review and questionnaire distribution to collected data, then followed by conducting system analysis and design with Object Oriented Analysis Design (OOAD) method. Furthermore, the study using use case diagram and class diagram in Unified Modeling Language (UML) notations.

One of its latest development is wearable device technology. Nowadays, the growth of this technology market is very positive. But unfortunately the growth of this technology is not followed by the availability of supporting applications that provide maximum benefits for users by utilizing personal health and activity data. This paper is intended to provide a report of our initial research in developing a health assistant solution that utilizes wearable device generated data. The whole research process is executed using Design Thinking approach that put the users as the main consideration. This initial research is started by designing a field research that can potentially gathered users' data generated from wearable device. A series of statistical and machine learning techniques are presented to analyze time series data to create a model. Finally, to implement the model, a mobile application prototype is also proposed.

Therefore, Chili becomes an ingredient in cooking that cannot be separated from Indonesian people. In certain months there is too much demand from the public and inversely proportional to the stock of chili. So, appreciate the chili prices to rise. In the heart of statistics, several methods can be used as forecasting as well as data series from univariate, bivariate and multivariate cases. The reason for choosing the method is following the analysis needs and available data. One of the popular methods in the multivariate case is Generalized Spacetime Autoregressive (GSTAR) the advantage of this method is that it can capture the characteristics of location-based data as well as time. For this reason, in this paper, we used chili prices data in 4 major cities in Java Province, Indonesia. Such as Jakarta, Bandung, Semarang, and Yogyakarta. As a result, GSTAR (21) I (1with inverse weighted be the best models because it fulfilled white noise and normal multivariate assumption with the lowest RMSE and MAPE. © 2018 IEEE.","forecasting; GSTAR; multivariate; space time","Forecasting; Information management; White noise; Auto-regressive; Data series; GSTAR; Indonesians; Location based; Major cities; multivariate; Space time; Costs",,,,,"This research funded by Bioinformatics and Data Science Research Center Bina Nusantara University, Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP), Actuarial Science Bandung Institute of Technology, Department of Statistics Padjadjaran University, and Department of Mathematics Kalimantan Institute of Technology",,"Caraka, R.E., Sugiyarto, W., Inflation rate modelling in Indonesia (2016) Etikonomi, 15 (2), pp. 111-124; Prahutama, A., Utami, T.W., Caraka, R.E., Zumrohtuliyosi, D., Pemodelan inflasi berdasarkan harga-harga pangan menggunakan spline multivariabel (2014) Media Stat, 7 (2), pp. 89-94; Suparti, Caraka, R., Warsito, B., Yasin, H., The shift invariant discrete wavelet transform (sidwt) with inflation time series Application (2016) J.

These models can help select optimal rice varieties for expected field conditions. Development of a system to help scientist track and make decisions using this data is challenging. It involves incorporation of complex data structures - genomic, phenotypic, and remote sensing - with computationally intensive statistical modeling. In this article, the authors present a web portal designed to help researchers to manage and analyze their datasets, apply machine learning to detect how factors taken together influence crop production, and summarize the results to help scientists make decisions based on the learned models. The authors developed the system to be easily accessed by the entire team including rice scientist, genetics, and farmers. As such, they developed a system on a server architecture comprised of a SQLite database, a web interface developed in Python, the Celery job scheduler, and statistical computing in R.

One of these factors that can support the decision making for museum is visitors experiences during their visits. To gauge these collective experiences, visitor studies are conducted regularly by museums. Several visitor study approaches have been introduced, ranging from a simple field observation to sophisticated sensory devices. We proposed a new approach to monitor the behavior of museum visitors through the implementation of a computer vision software called Eyeface. The software was used to capture visitor data, including demographic information and engagement level data. These data can be used by museum to make a decision in rearranging its exhibition that can improve visitors engagement level. Additionally, the demographic data can be a basis information for museum to create particular events or promotions targeting some specific group of visitors. This approach was tested in three different museums; one was located in Edinburgh, UK while two were in Jakarta, Indonesia. © 2017 IEEE.","computer vision; decision support; engagement; museum; visitor study","Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Decision making; Decision support systems; Exhibitions; Internet of things; Population statistics; Decision supports; Demographic data; Demographic information; Edinburgh , UK; engagement; Engagement levels; Field observations; Visitor studies; Museums",,,,"Tree Research and Education Endowment Fund","This project was fully funded by Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP).",,"Bitgood, S., (2013) Attention and Value: Keys to Understanding Museum Visitors, , Routledge; Sandifer, C., Technological novelty and open-endedness: Two characteristics of interactive exhibits that contribute to the holding of visitor attention in a science museum (2003) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 40 (2), pp. 121-137; Hornecker, E., X201c;i don x2019;t understand it either, but it is cool x201d;-visitor interactions with a multi-touch table in a museum (2008) 2008 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Horizontal Interactive Human Computer Systems, pp. 113-120. , Oct; Hornecker, E., Interactions around a contextually embedded system (2010) Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction, TEI '10, pp. 169-176. , , (New York, NY, USA)ACM; Goulding, C., The museum environment and the visitor experience (2000) European Journal of Marketing, 34 (3-4), pp. 261-278; Sheng, C.-W., Chen, M.-C., A study of experience expectations of museum visitors (2012) Tourism Management, 33 (1), pp. 53-60; Falk, J.H., Dierking, L.D., (2013) Museum Experience Revisited, , Routledge; Bechtel, R.B., (1967) Method and Apparatus for Performing A Hodometer Floor Use Study, , Oct. 10.

Traditional statistical approaches are identifying simple biomarkers in large samples, but clinical use cases are still being established. High-throughput clinical, imaging, and ‘omic’ technologies are generating data from SUD studies and may lead to more sophisticated and clinically useful models. However, analytic strategies suited for high-dimensional data are not regularly used. We review strategies for identifying biomarkers and biosignatures from high-dimensional data types. Focusing on penalized regression and Bayesian approaches, we address how to leverage evidence from existing studies and knowledge bases, using nicotine metabolism as an example. We posit that big data and machine learning approaches will considerably advance SUD biomarker discovery.

Supply Chain Management (SCM) system can overcome these problems, but the existing SCM is not yet in accordance with business processes for the salt industry. This research intended to create a model of web-based supply chain management (e-SCM) for Salt Industry. The data were gathered through interviews, questionnaires, and literature review. The analysis and design of the system used the Object Oriented Analysis & Design (OOAD) method which refers to Unified Process and using Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation. The analysis method is applied while the business is being operated and is based on the needs of the industry. The result of this research was an e-SCM system model that is intended to support operational activities for salt industry. © 2017 IEEE.","model; salt industry; supply chain management system; web-based","Information management; Models; Surveys; Unified Modeling Language; Websites; Analysis method; Business Process; Literature reviews; Object-oriented analysis; Operational activity; Salt industry; Supply chain management system; Web based; Supply chain management",,,,,,,"Setywati, E., Integrating and strengthening of national salt industry policy through value chain management upgrading (2015) Journal of African & Asian Local Government Studies, 4 (1), pp. 54-71; Lalit, M.S.N., Kumar, A., Barriers and their relative importance to the adoption of green supply chain management in indian context (2014) International Journal of Engineering Research & Technology, 3 (1), pp. 2260-2269; Muysinaliyev, A., Aktamov, S., Supply chain management concepts: Literature review (2014) IOSR Journal of Business and Management (IOSRJBM), 15 (6), pp. 60-66; Chopra, S., Meindl, P., (2016) Supply Chain Management: Strategy, Planning, and Operation, , Pearson Education; León-Peña, J., E-business and the supply chain management (2008) Business Intelligence Journal, 1 (1), pp. 77-89; Otchere, A.F., Annan, J., Quansah, E., Assessing the challenges and implementation of supply chain integration in the cocoa industry: A factor of cocoa farmers in Ashanti region of Ghana (2013) International Journal of Business and Social Science, 4 (5), pp. 112-123; Hilman, M., (2012) Supply Chain Management Berbasis Layanan: Desain Dan Implementasi Prototipe Sistem, , Universitas Indonesia; Pefkaros, K., Using object-oriented analysis and design over traditional structured analysis and design (2008) International Journal of Business Research, 8 (2), pp. 219-227; Satzinger, J.W., Jackson, R.B., Burd, S.D., (2016) Systems Analysis and Design in A Changing World, , Cengage",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2nd International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2017","15 November 2017 through 17 November 2017",,134470,,9781538629307,,,"English","Proc.

The development of health knowledge can be disseminated by utilizing mobile application based learning technology as media. Many things have been done by the government through special programs, among others, carried out breast cancer awareness campaign through breast self-screening program. The positive impact of this effort has led to mobile applications for learning about early detection of cancer in Indonesia. The development of mobile learning is a continuation of previous online learning to help the process of early detection of cervical cancer. Data collection methods used observation, interview, and questionnaire techniques, while instructional designs use the ADDIE (Analysis Design Development Implementation Evaluations) model and methods for developing object-oriented programming systems using Unified Modeling Language (UML).

To date, modern moving object detection methods require complex background modeling and thresholds tuning to confront illumination changes. This paper proposes an adaptive approach based on non-overlapping block texture representation. It aims to design a computationally light and efficient solution to improve the robustness of detection.

Arthropod Sampling was done by hand collecting, pitfall and bait traps, and Berlese extractor. The measured components of climatic factors comprise light intensity, air temperature, RH, and CO2 level, while the edaphic comprise soil temperature, SOC, N, P, soil moisture, and pH. Data were analyzed for richness, diversity, evenness, and dissimilarity indices measurement. We also conducted statistical analysis through Pearson correlation. All Arthropod samples were classified into six classes, 30 orders, and 209 morphospecies. The dark zones of wild caves with low human disturbance have lower richness, diversity, and evenness than the dark zones of show caves. Species richness of Arthropods in Show Caves is not always lower than wild caves, but the populations of common cavernicolous Arthropods (Rhaphidophora sp., Trachyjulus tjampeanus, Charon sp. and Sarax javensis) in show caves are almost smaller than wild caves. The Arthropod communities of wild caves with low disturbance have high dissimilarity with show cave communities. Highly disturbed show caves possess higher air temperature, light intensity, CO2, soil temperature and pH compared to wild caves particularly in the dark zone, while soil moisture, SOC, N, and P are lower. Light intensity, soil temperature, and SOC show the highest coefficient of correlation values with the indicators of Arthropods community. In conclusion, the recent study indicates that there are differences in the community structure of Arthropods and climatic-edaphic conditions within wild caves and show caves. Light intensity, soil temperature, and SOC give the strongest influences on Arthropod communities' structure. © EM International.","Cave management; Climatic; Conservation; Edaphic","arthropod; cave; community structure; conservation status; disturbance; environmental factor; karst; soil temperature; species diversity; species evenness; species richness; Indonesia; Arthropoda",,,,,"We thank to colleagues in Biospeleology Studdien Gruppen (BSG UNY) and Indonesian Speleological Society (ISS) for their helps in field work, to colleagues in Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense, Indonesia Research Institute (LIPI) for help in identification.

However, there are numerous difficulties in maintaining a reliable KM system. One of the challenges is to manage knowledge materials in video format. A video file contains complex data that lead to the difficulties in managing them. Without an intelligent system, managing videos for KM requires a laborious effort. In this paper, an intelligent framework for KM system, embedded with deep learning model, is proposed. The use of the deep learning model alleviates the heavy burden of video materials management in KM system.

Abundance, distribution of organisms and patterns of biodiversity are great interests for many ecologists. One of interesting ecosystems to be studied is a cave. A cave has a typical environment character with a vulnerable ecosystem. Many caves in Indonesia, particularly in Gunungsewu karst area have been developed into tourist objects (show caves) and managed imprudently. Such cave management has potential to harm the environment and leads to ecosystem destruction. Arthropods are the most abundance fauna in cave that play critical roles in maintaining cave ecosystems equilibrium. In the heart of statistical ecology, we need to analyze the differences on Arthropods community and abiotic (climatic-edaphic) parameters among show caves and wild caves. Statistical techniques are needed for the extraction of such information. GLLVM is one method that is able to explain spatial-based information and is particularly suitable for ecology. In this paper, we use negative binomial models to see the differences on spatial patterns of predator and decomposer Arthropods, also characteristic of edaphic and climatic in each cave. © 2018 The Authors.

The process of evaluating genetic markers one by one (i.e. a marginal analysis) may not identify important polygenic and environmental effects. Further, confounding due to growing conditions/factors and genetic similarities among plant varieties may influence conclusions. When developing new plant varieties to optimize yield or thrive in future adverse conditions (e.g. flood, drought), scientists seek a complete understanding of how the factors influence desirable traits. Motivated by a study design that measures rice yield across different seasons, fields, and plant varieties in Indonesia, we develop a regression method that identifies significant genomic factors, while simultaneously controlling for field factors and genetic similarities in the plant varieties. Our approach develops a Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimator under a generalized double Pareto shrinkage prior. Through a hierarchical representation of the proposed model, a novel and computationally efficient expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is developed for variable selection and estimation. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation and is used to analyze rice yields from a pilot study conducted by the Indonesian Center for Rice Research. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Bayesian hierarchical models; EM algorithm; genomic studies; MAP estimator; rice science; shrinkage prior","drought; expectation; genetic similarity; human; Indonesia; nonhuman; pilot study; plant yield; probability; rice; scientist; season; simulation; study design; varietas; algorithm; Bayes theorem; biological model; genetics; genomics; multifactorial inheritance; Oryza; procedures; Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Genomics; Models, Genetic; Multifactorial Inheritance; Oryza",,,,"R01 AI121351

Studies show that TBL can provide opportunities in developing teamwork capabilities and enhancing active learning, which are effects that could remedy the weaknesses of implementing blended learning. A blended teaching portfolio was developed for an International Human Resource Management course that consisted of a course overview, graduate competency, a syllabus, course material resources, a teaching scenario, a reading assurance test, midterm/final exams, student assignments, assessment of learning outcomes, and a course quality improvement sheet. Each item was constructed based on the characteristics of the course. The portfolio was considered a valuable tool for lecturers to manage a blended-learning course that can help students in achieving higher scores and in motivating them to read course materials prior to class sessions.","E-learning; Face to Face; In Person; Learning Management System; Online Learning; Readiness Assurance Process; Syllabus; Team Based Learning",,,,,,,,"Alebaikan, R., Troudi, S., Blended learning in Saudi universities: Challenges and perspectives (2010) ALT-J.

Usually, consumer will do a strategy to coping the confusion, that strategy is known as Confusion Reduction Strategy. The conventional ways usually taken by the consumer to reduce the confusion are, such as: Asking for product recommendation to close relatives, seeking for an additional product information on the internet and so on. However, suggestions and recommendations from conventional sources obtained by the consumer, sometimes are not always accurate (not objective) and time consuming (inefficient). Therefore, this research proposes a Decision Support System (DSS) application to cope with the confusion. In this study, the comparison results between conventional methods (such as: Asking advice to close relatives or seeking for an additional information on the internet) with the proposed method (the DSS) were presented. In addition, another implication of this study is to get the factors that causing consumer confusion in case of smartphone purchases. This research used mixed-method approach, implemented through interview and survey. Research samples were 136 potential smartphone buyers which are converted to 27 smartphone buyers; brand image is the main source of consumer confusion (mean 3.98, std. dev 0.86), followed by proliferation of brands, services and models of smartphone products (mean 3.89, std. dev 0.82). Respondents often use Word of Mouth (WoM) communication as main source of information to reduce the confusion, results of 16 from 27 transactions were contributed from WoM. DSS application contributed only 2 of 27 smartphone transactions. Further research for the development of mobile based DSS application as an alternative conventional CRS needs to be conducted, because of the potential success of static desktop based DSS application in reducing potential consumer confusion especially for value oriented buyers. © 2014 Science Publication.","Confusion Reduction Strategy; Consumer Confusion; Decision Support System; Fuzzy Logic; Simple Additive Weighting",,,,,,,,"Afshari, A., Mojahed, M., Yusuff, R.M., Simple additive weighting approach to personnel selection problem (2010) Int.

The goal of a parallel program is to enable the execution of larger problems and to reduce the execution time compared to sequential programs. Among parallel computing frameworks, MapReduce is a framework that enables parallel processing of data on collections of commodity computing nodes without the need to handle the complexities of implementing a parallel program. This paper presents implementations of the parallel Jacobi and Conjugate Gradient methods using MapReduce. A performance analysis shows that MapReduce can speed up the Jacobi method over sequential processing for dense matrices with dimension ≥ 14,000. © 2014 Muhamad Fitra Kacamarga, Bens Pardamean and James Baurley.","Conjugate gradient; Iterative method; Jacobi method; Mapreduce; Parallel computing",,,,,,,,"Legarra, A., Methods based on SNP estimation (BLUP_SNP and BayesCPi etc.) (2012), http://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=uga_2_normal_lasso_bayesc.pdf, [Online].

It enables job seekers to look for an employment, to advance their careers, or to market themselves. As for the employers, they can post vacant positions to be filled with suitable employees. A certain job portal received numerous complaints regarding its features that were unable to fulfill the users' needs. These complaints led to the decrease of the number of users. A study was conducted to determine factors that influenced users' interest by referring to the 7C framework. Questionnaires were distributed to numerous job seekers and employers. The data were analyzed using multiple linear regression technique. Chi-square analysis was also performed to further analyze which elements of the 7C framework were essential for the users. The results showed that only four out of seven elements from the framework affected the users' choice towards job portal, namely the context, the content, the community, and the commerce.

Most endeavors have been inefficient, rendering an objective of determining the initial steps that could be taken to improve these efforts by assessing a student population's computer skill levels and performances in an IT course. Demographic factors were also taken into account while formulating these recommendations. Basic computer skill levels were measured through the administration of the Technical Survival Skill Test (TSST) questionnaire, developed by the University of Toronto. Academic performances were evaluated through several assignments designed by the IT course instructors. The main result of this study indicated that computer skill levels did have a direct correlation with a student's academic performance level. The database was further parsed based on demographical factors, resulting in a set of recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of e-learning. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.","Learning management system; LMS; Technical survival skill test; TSST",,,,,,,,"Anderson, T., Toward a Theory of Online Learning (2004) Theory and Practice of Online Learning, pp. 33-60. , In T.

It is believed that an online learning system can significantly improve the quality of education since it transcends time and space, a desirable trait in today's fast-paced and Internet-laden world. Nowadays, the 3D interface system used as a medium of online learning has further improved the 2D interface system. However, what kind of 3D interface system should be designed to increase students' interaction and engagement with the system? This paper details a 3D interface design that can meet the demands of interactivity and engagement for the system. By applying the Qualitative-Interactive approach, data were collected through literature study and interviews with several experienced practitioners in the field of online learning. Based on the results of data analysis, it was concluded that there were two key features that should be included in the 3D interface design, namely avatar and environment. The presence of both features is expected to increase students' interactivity and engagement within an online learning system. A prototype design was created to depict a more concrete picture on the benefits and the ease of 3D interface system usage, equipped with both avatar and environment features. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

This new approach required students' active construction of knowledge as both an individual and team. Students were asked to begin their studies through the viewing of digital models in videos through an online learning portal. Camtasia Studio was utilized in creating video contains class material and experiments along with the teacher's audio explanation. The TBL approach was implemented as the instructional strategy during in-class sessions. A portion of the classroom time was spent ensuring that students master the class material and a vast majority of class time was used for team assignments that focused on problem-based learning and simulating complex questions that the student would face as the course developed. The utilization of digital models and TBL improved the students' ability to learn independently and to present their ideas coherently, transforming them into more engaged, independent learners, not just in science learning but also in their overall academic experience. © 2014 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","digital model; science teaching; TBL; Team-Based Learning","Communication systems; Students; Teaching; Complex questions; Digital model; Instructional strategy; Problem based learning; Science learning; Science teaching; TBL; Team-based learning; Information technology",,,,,,,"Hasil, P.K.D.P., Pembelajaran IPA dan Matematika di Sekolah Dasar, 2. , http://jurnal.fkip.uns.ac.id/index.php/pgsdkebumen/.../208, Puput Eriska W. 3, Dedi, PN 4, Uswatun Khasanah 5 PGSD FKIP Universitas Sebelas Maret.

Cataloging and linking genetic variation in Asian rice to important traits, such as quality and yield, is needed in developing superior varieties of rice. We develop a bioinformatics workflow for quality control and data analysis of genetic and trait data for a diversity panel of 467 rice varieties found in Indonesia. The bioinformatics workflow operates using a back-end relational database for data storage and retrieval. Quality control and data analysis procedures are implemented and automated using the whole genome data analysis toolset, PLINK, and the [R] statistical computing language. The 467 rice varieties were genotyped using a custom array (717,312 genotypes total) and phenotyped for 12 traits in four locations in Indonesia across multiple seasons. We applied our bioinformatics workflow to these data and present prototype genome-wide association results for a continuous trait - days to flowering. Two genetic variants, located on chromosome 4 and 12 of the rice genome, showed evidence for association in these data. We conclude by outlining extensions to the workflow and plans for more sophisticated statistical analyses. © 2014 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","agriculture genetics; bioinformatics; data analysis; genome-wide association study; statistical genetics; workflow","Communication systems; Data reduction; Food supply; Genes; Information technology; Quality control; Days to flowering; Genetic variation; Genome-wide association; Genome-wide association studies; Relational Database; Statistical computing; Statistical genetics; workflow; Bioinformatics",,,,,,,"International rice genome sequencing project: The map-based sequence of the rice genome (2005) Nature, 436 (7052), pp. 793-800; Zhao, K., Tung, C.W., Eizenga, G.C., Wright, M.H., Ali, M.L., Price, A.H., Norton, G.J., McCouch, S., Genome-wide association mapping reveals a rich genetic architecture of complex traits in oryza sativa (2011) Nat.

Agriculture geneticists are faced with numerous computational obstacles with storing, processing, and analyzing genetic and trait data. We introduce a web application for large-scale agriculture genetic diversity and association studies that aims to simplify and automate many of the data management and analysis tasks common across studies. We present a case study where our software is configured and populated with genome-wide data of over 750,000 genetic markers from the commercially available BovineHD array (Illumina Inc.).

Data were collected through interviews with the company's human resources department and occupational health provider. As for the model, literature and online research were conducted to collect health standards and information system standards on existing DisMan systems. These standards were then compared to the consumer electronics manufacturer's DisMan. The model was designed by utilizing class, use-case, as well as sequence diagrams. The result was an information system model with a registry system that can specifically support DisMan in a consumer electronics manufacturer. The registry system included a medical alert management system and a self-monitoring system. The latter system was supported by the former system, which can assist the DisMan's staff in monitoring the employees' scrupulousness regarding their health care plan as well as notifying the employees on lifestyle management. © 2013 Science Publication.","Alert management system; Disease management; Information system model; Medical care plan; Self-monitoring",,,,,,,,"Aiko, H., Domestic Violence (1995) Japanese Women: New Feminist Perspectives On the Past, Present and Future, pp. 265-267. , Fujimura-Fanselow, K. and A.

One of the initial problems with SIS implementation was that it depended on the availability of computers and internet access. With slow internet connections, authentication process could be time consuming, especially if a website implements various external scripts to improve visual quality. Due to these reasons, as well as the fact that BlackBerry is one of the most popular smartphones in Indonesia, the developers decided to design a simpler but more powerful system that would resolve Blackberry Mobile SIS problems. The mobile SIS was designed, implemented and evaluated to provide a perfect solution for problems related to ease-of-access. The Mobile SIS facilitates students and parents in obtaining academic information anytime, anywhere and without the need for repeated authentication, via BlackBerry mobile connection. Mobile SIS also offers faster loading time relative to traditional website access. Using the push technology service, SIS could now provide students and parents in getting the latest information every time new information gets disseminated. © 2013 Science Publications.","Mobile phone; Push technology; School information system",,,,,,,,"Davenport, T.H., Prusak, L., (2000) Working Knowledge: How Organizations Manage What They Know. 2nd Edn., p. 199. , Harvard Business Press, Boston, USA., ISBN-10: 1578513014; Guthery, S.B., Cronin, M.J., (2002) Mobile Application Development with SMS and the SIM Toolkit. 1st Edn., p. 305. , McGraw-Hill, New York, ISBN- 10: 0071375406; Heikkinen, K., Eerola, J., Jappinen, P., Porras, J., (2007) Personalized view of personal information, , University of Technology, Lappeenranta; Juhlin, D., (2010) Mobile application analytics: Specification for an online analytics tool, , MSc, Thesis Lulea University of Technology; Jun, G., Tarasewich, P., (2006) Guidelines for handheld mobile device interface design, , Northeastern University; Laird, T., (2002) Character at Work, , University Park, Pennsylvania, PA; Ludford, P.J., Frankowski, D., Reily, K., Wilms, K., Terveen, L., (2006) Because I carry my cell phone anyway: Functional location-based reminder applications, pp. 889-898. , Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, Apr. 22-27, ACM Press, Montreal, Canada, DOI: 10.1145/1124772.1124903; Payne, S.J., Understanding calendar use (1993) Hum.

In this study, the experimental group used the blended-learning method while the control group used the conventional learning method. Blended learning is defined as a combination between e-learning with LMS and conventional learning. T-test and Pearson's correlation analyses were performed. T-test method was used in order to determine the significant difference of scores between the experimental and the control groups. The result demonstrated that students in the experimental group performed significantly better than those in the control group. The pre-test scores in algebra, calculus, and discrete mathematics showed no significant differences across the board, demonstrating the homogeneity among both groups' participants. Furthermore, the study also utilized the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to measure user acceptance of the system. It was found that TAM can be considered as a valid instrument to assess the user acceptance of a system which in this study was the application of graph theory in LMS environment on a subject course at higher education level. © 2005 - 2013 JATIT & LLS.

Individuals who have had their first stroke with permanent damage could become an economic burden to their family and a social burden to the society due to their unproductive nature. Stroke could be prevented and its risk factors have been identified. Through a stroke prevention information system, the user could be made more aware of stroke risks and symptoms. An expert system would be able to direct and motivate users to keep themselves healthy therefore preventing first and recurrent strokes. The expert system is built using an inference engine that provides stroke risk level based on information provided by the user. Information collected are self measured blood pressure, cigarettes consumed, amount of physical activity and body mass index. Users are presented with suggested preventive tasks to reduce their stroke risk. © 2013 Science Publications.",,,,,,,,,"(2012) About Stroke, , ASA, American Heart Association; Biswas, M.M., Sen, S., Simmons, J., Etiology and risk factors of ischemic stroke in Indian- American patients from a hospital-based registry in New Jersey (2009) USA.

Mandatory drug testing at schools was a strong deterrent against school violence and illegal drug possession on school ground. This system can help teachers, students and parents to be aware of the danger of drug that impacts all students. Furthermore, this new online portal design can assist the counseling department to organize the repository much better than before which was used a manual system. There were some methods used to design this system that implemented through people, technology and process. The methods that were used to collect all supporting data involved surveys, observations, and interviews. Phases in the software development life cycle were followed during the online portal creation. The study showed that this drug testing online portal really helped all parties that were part of this system especially the counselors who have access to the historical data that can provide student progress. This progress report can be communicated to the parents in a timely manner. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Counseling department; Drug testing; Health division; On-line portal",,,,,,,,"Parsai, M.B., Castro, F.G., Marsiglia, F.F., Harthun, M.L., Valdez, H., Using community based participatory research to createa culturally grounded intervention for parents and youth to prevent risky behaviors (2010) Society for Prevention Research, 12 (1), pp. 34-47; Herrera, C., Grossman, J.B., Kauh, T.J., McMaken, J., Mentoring in schools: An impact study of big brothers big sisters school-based mentoring (2011) Journal Child Development, 82, pp. 346-361; Shillingford, M.A., Lambie, G.W., Williamsburg, M., Contribution of professional school counselors' values and leadership practices to their programmatic service delivery (2010) American School Counselor Association, 13 (4); Gerada, C., Gilvarry, E., Random drug testing in schools in british (2005) Journal of General Practice, 55, pp. 499-501; Ludtke, D., An Investigation of Random Drug Testing as a Preventative Measure to Inhibit Drug Use in College Students, , http://digitalcommons.olivet.edu/edd_diss/252011; Deshmukh, N., Petróczi, N., Barker, J., Székely, A.D., Hussain, I., Naughton, D.P., Potentially harmful advantage to athletes: Aputative connection between UGT2B17 gene deletion polymorphism and renal disorders with prolonged use of anabolic androgenic steroids (2010) Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy, 5 (7); Whitten, J., Bentley, L., Dittman, K., (2007) Systems Analysis and Designs Method, , Seventh Edition.

Previously, this data intensive research required computing and personnel resources accessible only to large institutions. Cloud computing allows researchers to analyze their data without a local computing infrastructure. We evaluated the feasibility of cloud computing for association analysis of genome-wide data. Our approach utilized the MapReduce model which divides the analysis into independent units and distributes the work to a computing cloud. We evaluated our approach by modeling the relationships between genetic variants and disease in a simulated genome-wide association study. We generated several data sets of 100,000 subjects and various number of genetic variants, and demonstrated that our analysis approach is scalable and provides an attractive alternative to establishing and maintaining a local computing cluster. © 2012 Springer-Verlag GmbH.",,"Analysis approach; Association analysis; Computational challenges; Computing clusters; Computing infrastructures; Data intensive; Data sets; Genetic data; Genetic variants; Genome-wide association; Genotyping; Map-reduce; Personnel resources; Cloud computing; Cluster computing; Computer applications; Research; Genes",,,,,,,"Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, , http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/; Amazon Elastic Mapreduce, , http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/; Amazon Elastic Mapreduce Pricing, , http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/pricing/; Amazon Simple Storage Service, , http://aws.amazon.com/s3/; Amazon Web Services, , http://aws.amazon.com; http://hadoop.apache.org/; Illumina Snp Genotyping, , http://www.illumina.com/applications/detail/ snp_genotyping_and_cnv_analysis/ whole_genome_genotyping_and_copy_number_variation_analysis.ilmn; Dean, J., (2004) Mapreduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters, , http://www.eecs.umich.edu/?klefevre/eecs584/Handouts/mapreduce.pdf, Usenix SDI; Mell, P., (2009) The Nist Definition of Cloud Computing, , http://www.mendeley.com/research/nist-definition-cloud-computing-v15/, National Institute of Standards and Technology; Purcell, S., Neale, B., Todd-Brown, K., Thomas, L., Ferreira, M.A.R., Bender, D., Maller, J., Sham, P.C., Plink: A tool set for whole-genome association and population-based linkage analyses (2007) Am.

The quantitative analysis was focused on measuring students' critical thinking skills achievement from their first through third years of dental education at the University of Southern California. This non-experimental evaluation was based on a volunteer sample of ninety-eight dental students who completed a demographics/academic questionnaire and a psychometric assessment known as the Health Sciences Reasoning Test (HSRT). The HSRT produced the overall critical thinking skills score. Additionally, the HSRT generated five subscale scores: analysis, inference, evaluation, deductive reasoning, and inductive reasoning. The results of this study concluded that the students showed no continuous and significant incremental improvement in their overall critical thinking skills score achievement during their PBL-based dental education. Except for the inductive reasoning score, this result was very consistent with the four subscale scores. Moreover, after performing the statistical adjustment on total score and subscale scores, no significant statistical differences were found among the three student groups. However, the results of this study found some aspects of critical thinking achievements that differed by categories of gender, race, English as first language, and education level.","Critical thinking skills; Dental education; Problem-based learning; Psychometrics","achievement; adult; aptitude test; article; cross-sectional study; curriculum; dental education; dental student; education; educational status; female; human; language; male; methodology; problem based learning; psychometry; questionnaire; race; sex difference; thinking; United States; Achievement; Adult; Aptitude Tests; California; Continental Population Groups; Cross-Sectional Studies; Curriculum; Education, Dental; Educational Measurement; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Language; Male; Problem-Based Learning; Psychometrics; Questionnaires; Sex Factors; Students, Dental; Thinking; Young Adult",,,,,,,"Fincham, A.G., Shuler, C.F., The changing face of dental education: The impact of PBL (2001) J Dent Educ, 65 (5), pp. 406-421; Newman, M., Ambrose, K., Corner, T., Evans, J., Morris-Vincent, P., Quinn, S., Evaluating Educational Impact: The Approach Followed by the Project on the Effectiveness of Problem-Based Learning (PEPBL), , Paper presented at the 2003 Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Council, Chicago, IL; Kenny, N.P., Beagan, B.L., The patient as text: A challenge for problem-based learning (2004) Medical Education, 38 (10), pp. 1071-1079. , DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2929.2004.01956.x; Gijbels, D., Dochy, F., Van Den Bossche, P., Segers, M., Effects of problem-based learning: A meta-analysis from the angle of assessment (2005) Rev Educational Res, 75 (1), p. 30; www.usc.edu/hsc/dental/about/history.htm, University of Southern California School of Dentistry.

They are also both conversational technologies and constructivist learning tools. Their interactive, collaborative, user-friendly, and instant archival features have transformed blogs into effective tools for enhancing case-based teaching methods in the asynchronous nature of the online environment. This study investigated the student populace's acceptance of the blog technology through the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework. UTAUT integrates eight theories from social psychology and sociology in order to examine the effects of major factors on behavioral intention and actual use of blog to learn e-business course materials and topic discussions. The results showed that both social influence and performance expectancy had a significant relationship with behavioral intention, whereas effort expectancy did not. In this study, behavioral intention did not have a significant relationship with actual usage level of blogs as a learning tool.","Blog; e-learning; Technology acceptance; UTAUT",,,,,,,,"Hsu, J., Innovative Technologies for Education and Learning: Education and Knowledge-Oriented Applications of Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts, and More (2008) International Journal of Web-Based Learning and Teaching Technologies, 3 (3), pp. 62-81; Lu, H.-P., Hsiao, K.-L., Understanding Intention to continuously Share Information on Weblogs (2007) Internet Research, 17 (4), pp. 345-361. , DOI: 10.1108/10662240710828030; Chen, C., Wu, J., Yang, S.C., Accelerating the Use of Weblogs as an Alternative Method to Deliver Case-Based Learning (2008) International Journal On E-Learning, 7 (2), pp. 331-349; Ayub, A.F.M., Tarmizi, R.A., Jafaar, W., Marzuki, W., Ali, W., Zah, W., Luan, W.S., Factors Influencing Students Use a Learning Management System Portal: Perspective from Higher Education Students (2010) International Journal of Education and Information Technologies, 2 (4), pp. 101-108; Ellison, N.B., Wu, Y., Blogging in the Classroom: A Preliminary Exploration of Student Attitudes and Impact on Comprehension (2008) Journal of Educational Multimedia and Hypermedia, 17 (1), pp. 99-122; Wang, S.-K., Hsu, H.-Y., Reflection from Using Blogs to Expand In-class Discussion (2008) Tech Trend, 52 (3), pp. 81-85; El-Bakry, H.M., Mastorakis, N., Activation of Informal Learning with E-Learning Technology (2009) Proceedings of the 8th WSEAS International Conference On Education and Educational Technology (EDU'09), p. 2009. , University of Genova, Genova, Italy; Vlahovic, N., Pozgaj, Z., Vuksic, V.B., Managing Online Learning Resources Using Web 2.0 Tools a Croatian Experience (2011) International Journal of Education and Information Technologies, 1 (5), pp. 59-68; Tasir, Z., Al-Dheleai, Y.M.H., Harun, J., Shukor, N.A., Students Perception towards the Use of Social Networking as an e-Learning Platform (2011) Proceedings of the 10th WSEAS International Conference On Education and Educational Technology (EDU'11), p. 2011. , Penang, Malaysia; Fred, D.D., Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, and User Acceptance of Information Technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3), pp. 319-340; Venkatesh, V., Morris, M.G., Davis, G.B., Davis, F.D., User Acceptance of Information Technology: Toward A Unified View (2003) MIS Quarterly, 27 (3), pp. 425-478; Thompson, R.L., Higgins, C.A., Howell, J.M., Personal Computing: Toward a Conceptual Model of Utilization (1991) MIS Quarterly, 15 (1), pp. 124-143; Moore, G.C., Benbasat, I., Development of an Instrument to Measure the Perceptions of Adopting an Information Technology Innovation (1991) Information Systems Research, 2 (3), pp. 192-222; Compeau, D.R., Higgins, C.A., Computer Self Efficacy: Development of a Measure and Initial Test (1995) MIS Quarterly, 19 (2), pp. 189-211; Devellis, R.F., (1991) Scale Development: Theory & Applications, , Newbury Park, CA: SAGE Publications; Levine, R., Locke, C., Searls, D., Weinberger, D., (2000) The Cluetrain Mainfesto: The End of Business As Usual, , Cambridge, MA: Perseus; Ferris, S.P., Wilder, H., Uses and Potentials of Wikis in the Classroom (2006) Innovate, 1 (5); Seitzinger, J., (2006) Be Constructive: Blogs, Podcasts, and Wikis As Constructivist Learning Tools, p. 2006. , Learning Solutions, July; Abazi-Bexheti, L., Kadriu, A., Ahmedi, L., (2010) Measurement and Assessment of Learning Management System Usage In Proceedings of the 6th WSEAS/IASME International Conference On Educational Technologies (EDUTE'10), p. 2010. , Kantaoui, Sousse, Tunisia; Dasgupda, S., Haddad, M., Weiss, P., dan Bermudez, E., User Acceptance of Case Tools in System Analysis and Design: An Empirical Study (2007) Journal of Informatics Education Research, 9 (1), pp. 51-78; Sedana, I.G.N., Wijaya St., W., UTAUT Model for Understanding Learning Management System (2010) Internetworking Internet Journal, 2 (2), pp. 27-32; Stoel, L., Lee, K.H., Modeling the Effect of Experience on Student Acceptance of Web-based Courseware (2003) Internet Research, 13, pp. 364-375; Coulter, P., Draper, L., Blogging It into Them: Weblogs in Information Literacy Instruction (2006) Journal of Library Administration, 45 (1), pp. 101-115; Nardi, B.A., Schiano, D.J., Gumbrecht, M., Swartz, L., (2004) Why We Blog.

There are five processes to evaluate the performance: 1) resize the images' resolution from 1280 x 960 to 640 x 480; 2) convert the images from JPEG2000 to JPEG format; 3) convert the images into grayscales; 4) run the images with both Libor Masek's and VeriEye software; 5) measure the performance of the two software using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plot and the operational time framework. The ROC plots show that VeriEye software performs better than Libor Masek's. There is significant difference in the processing time between the two software.","Bath images; Biometric; Iris recognition; Libor Masek; VeriEye",,,,,,,,"Jain, A.K., Ross, A., Prabhakar, S., An Introduction to Biometric Recognition (2004) IEEE Transaction on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 14 (1), pp. 4-20; (2011) U.

Prospective cohort study. Four HMO (Southern California Kaiser‐Permanente) hospitals. 3,697 patients 65 years of age or older admitted to any inpatient service from July 1 through September 30, 1990. Screening measures for standardized targeting criteria, administered 24–48 hours after admission. Overall, 35.1% of patients screened met at least one inclusionary criterion, which is considerably higher than other published reports. The most commonly met criteria were incontinence, impairment in performing activities of daily living, malnutrition, and immobility. The percentage of patients meeting at least one criterion and meeting each criterion varied considerably among hospitals. The vast majority of patients (83%) who were judged appropriate for assessment met at least three criteria. The yield of standardized criteria differs when applied to patients in different health care systems and to patients at different hospitals within a health care system, which may reflect differences in the populations being served and the practice styles of physicians and the delivery system. Because no single criterion identified more than approximately half of patients who were judged appropriate for assessment, it is likely that a battery of criteria will be necessary to identify these patients. © 1992 The American Geriatrics Society",,"aged; article; daily life activity; geriatric patient; geriatrics; health care system; health maintenance organization; hospitalization; human; immobilization; incontinence; intellectual impairment; major clinical study; malnutrition; mortality; nursing home; priority journal; prospective study; United States",,,,,,,"Epstein, AM, Hall, JA, Besdine, R, The emergence of geriatric assessment units: The “new technology of geriatrics” (1987) Ann Intern Med, 106, pp. 299-303; (1987) Geriatric assessment methods for clinical decision making, 6 (13); Rubenstein, LZ, Siu, AL, Wieland, D, Comprehensive geriatric assessment: Toward understanding its efficacy (1989) Aging: Clin Exp Res, 1, pp. 87-98; Winograd, CH, Gerety, MB, Brown, E, Targeting the hospitalized elderly for geriatric consultation (1988) J Am Geriatr Soc, 36, pp. 1113-1119; Winograd, CH, Gerety, MB, Chung, M, Targeting criteria to identify the frail hospitalized elderly: Correlation with outcomes (1991) J Am Geriatr Soc, 39, pp. 778-784; Hogan, DB, Fox, RA, A prospective controlled trial of a geriatric consultation team in an acute‐care hospital (1990) Age Ageing, 19, pp. 107-113; Rubenstein, LZ, Josephson, KR, Wieland, GD, Differential prognosis and utilization patterns among clinical subgroups of hospitalized geriatric patients (1986) Health Serv Res, 20 (6), pp. 881-895; Fox, PD, Tailor made elder care (1991), pp. 25-29. , HMO Magazine Jan./Feb; Calkins, E, Care of the elderly in HMOs (1990) HMO Pract, 4, pp. 1-2; Zendle, LJ, Reuben, DB, Borok, GM, Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment for high‐risk, hospitalized patients in a health maintenance organization (submitted for publication); Winograd, CH, Targeting strategies: An overview of criteria and outcomes (1991) Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, 39 S, pp. 25S-35S; Rubenstein, LZ, Goodwin, M, Hadley, Targeting criteria for geriatric evaluation and management research (1991) Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, 39 S, pp. 37S-41S; Winograd, CH, (1991), The final report: An analysis of an acute geriatric evaluation service., ;HSR&D IIR #84–062","Reuben, D.B.; correspondence and request for reprints to David B.

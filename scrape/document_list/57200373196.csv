Hydroponics has become a reality for greenhouse growers in virtually all climates. Large hydroponic installations exist throughout the world for growing flowers, vegetables and some short period fruit like tomato and cucumber. In soilless culture, we must maintain stable pH and conductivity level of nutrient solution to make plant grow well, large variation of pH of certain time will poisoned plant. This paper describes development complete automation hydroponic system, from maintaining stable nutrient composition (conductivity and pH), grow light, and monitor plant environment such as CO2, temperature and humidity. The heart of our automation is ARM Cortex-M4 from ST Microelectronic running ARM mbed OS, the official Real Time Operating System (RTOS) for ARM Cortex-M microcontroller. Using RTOS gives us flexibility to have multithreaded process. Results show that system capable to control desired concentration level with variation of less than 3%, pH sensor show good accuracy 5.83% from pH value 3.23-10. Growing light intensity measurement show result 105 μmol/m2/s therefore we need turn on the light at least 17 hours/day to fulfil plant light requirement. RTOS give good performance with latency and jitter less than 15 us, system overall show good performance and accuracy for automating hydroponic plant in vegetative phase of growth. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","ARM Cortex-M; growing light; Hydroponic; mbed OS; nutrient solution; RTOS","Computer operating systems; Microcontrollers; Microelectronics; Nutrients; pH; pH sensors; Arm cortices; Hydroponic; Light-intensity measurement; Nutrient solution; Nutrient-rich solutions; Real time operating system; RTOS; Temperature and humidities; ARM processors",,,,,"Ahmad, R., Ahad, K., Iqbal, R., Muhammad, A., Acute Poisoning Due to Commercial Pesticides in Multan (2002) Pakistan Journal of Medcal Sciences, 18, pp. 227-231; Roberto, K., (2003) How-To Hydroponic, , 4 (Futuregarden); Sahare, V., Jain, P., Automated Hydroponic System using Psoc4 Prottyping Kit to Deliver Nutrients Solution Directly to Roots of Plants on Time Basis (2015) International Journal of Advanced Research in Electrical, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, 4, pp. 8765-8770; Mishra, R.I., Jain, P., Design and Implementation of Automatic Hydroponics System using ARM Processor (2015) International Journal of Advanced Research in Electrical, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, 4 (8), pp. 6935-6940; Umamaheswari, S., Preethi, A., Pravin, E., Dhanusha, R., Integrating Scheduled Hydroponic System IEEE International Conference on Advances in Computer Applications (ICACA), , (Coimbatore, India, 2016); Torres, A., Lopez, R.F., (2012) Measuring Daily Light Integral in A Greenhouse, , (Purdue); Olle, M., Viršile, A., The effect of light-emitting diode lighting on greenhouse plant growth and quality (2013) Agricultural and Food Science, 22, pp. 223-234; Massa, G.D., Kim, H.-H., Wheeler, R.M., Mitchell, C.A., Plant Productivity in Response to LED Ligthing (2008) HortScience, 43, pp. 1951-1956; Philips, (2014) Philips Ligth Recipes in Horticulture, , (Philips); (2017) Open Agriculture Initative (OpenAg), , https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/open-agriculture-openag/overview/, MIT Media Lab, [Online]; Li, Q., Yao, C., (2003) Real-Time Concepts for Embedded Systems, , R.-T.

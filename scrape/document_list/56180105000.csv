The main function of the application is to search restaurant information. Other functions are also available in this application such as add restaurant, add promotion, add photo, add food review, and other features including social networking features. The restaurant and promotion searching application will be developed under Android platform. Upon completion of this paper, heuristic evaluation and usability testing have been conducted. The result of both testing shows that the application is highly usable. Even though there are some usability problems discovered, the problems can be eliminated immediately by implementing the recommendations from the expert evaluators and the users as the testers of the application. Further improvement made to the application will ensure that the application can really be beneficial for the users of the application. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.","Digital dashboard management; DSS; Model; Simulation; System dynamic",,,,,,"Erry, (2012) Jumlah Smartphone di Indonesia Meningkat 460 Persen; Einhorn, B., (2012) Indonesians Still Love Their BlackBerrys; Vere, K., (2012) Tracking Growth: The ITunes App Store Vs Google Play; (2012) Apple Adds 'Food & Drink' Section to App Store; Dancy, J., (2012) Dine and Dish: Are Social Media and Food the Perfect Pairing; Alana, K., (2012) Instagram & Co.: The Mobile Era of Food Photography; Cogert, M., Mobile Website or Mobile App: Advantages and Disadvantages of Both; What Is An App Store?; (2012) Apple Adds 'Food & Drink' Section to App Store; Brandau, M., (2012) Study: Restaurant Strategies Differ for Smartphone, Tablet Apps; Virrantaus, K., Markkula, J., Garmash, A., Terziyan, Y., Developing GIS-supported location- based services (2001) Proc. of WGIS'2001, pp. 423-432; Steiniger, S., Neun, M., Edwardes, A., Foundations of Location Based Services; Boyd, D.M., Ellison, N.B., Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship, 13, p. 1; (2013) Facebook Statistics by Countries; Hadiwiyana, O., (2012) Beberapa Data Internet, Social Media, Mobile di Indonesia; Zheng, Y., Location-based social networks: Users (2011) Computing with Spatial Trajectories, , Eds.

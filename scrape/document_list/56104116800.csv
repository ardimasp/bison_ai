The aim of this paper is to reduce child abduction in general or maternity hospital, which is important in Indonesia because of many cases of child abduction, appeared in those hospitals. The method of child tracking and monitoring of this paper is using Mobile Ad-Hoc Network with DSDV routing to substitute GPS tracking which was limited especially inside a building. The system using Triangulation Estimation method to determine approximation of child or patient position in certain area. The simulation demonstration showed that it gives good performance to track child or patient but compromised when number of nodes in certain area is increased. © 2014 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","DSDV; MANET; Tracking System; Triangular estimation","DSDV; Estimation methods; GPS tracking; Indonesia; MANET; Tracking system; Hospitals; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,,,"(2012) MNCTV, , http://news.mnctv.com/index.php?option=comcontent&task=view&id=17619, Available, [Last accessed: 15 August 2013]; http://nasional.kompas.com/read/2012/01/06/10354265/Waspadalah.Penculik.Anak.Masih.Terus, Kompas, 6 January 2012.

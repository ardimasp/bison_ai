With the advancement of mass digital payment, IFMIS must also be able to include this practice to maintain the efficiency of state finance operation. In line with demands for efficiency and transparency, shared service centers are also increasingly becoming a common practice in government. Therefore, in an effort to get the full benefits of IFMIS investment in Indonesia, this paper designs one of business architectures for shared service-mass payment management of the Indonesia state finance based on the TOGAF-ADM framework. With this design, it is recommended that various mass payments such as payments for payrolls, government credit cards, official travel costs, common expenses and social assistances can be done more efficiently and transparently and consolidated in a shared service center. Hence, millions of mass payments which are previously carried out individually by thousands of working units across Indonesia could be simplified into smaller number of consolidated payments executed by a shared service center. It is also transforming millions of manual operation processes into much more efficient digital operation processes, maximizing the benefit of collaboration between state owned information systems with the availability of private information systems which are becoming very advanced. This proposed end-state business architectures obviously enhance the efficiency and transparency of state financial operation. This is the contribution of this paper, in addition to contributing to architectural enterprises of digital government in state financial sector which are very complex and still progress unevenly in many countries. © 2020 Little Lion Scientific.

Thus, controlling Aedes mosquito through the effective dengue control strategy had become the focus of government in controlling the spread of dengue virus. The aim of this paper is to prioritize the dengue control activities focuses on epidemic mitigation strategy. This strategy emphasizes on preventing the outbreak by implementing the high-impact activities at the beginning of outbreak period. The prioritized Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference (FTOPSIS) model was developed based on the four dengue control activities namely fogging and larvaciding, premise inspection, public education and vector surveillance. Finding from the analysis shows that fogging and larvaciding, and premise inspection were the two appropriate controlling activities for epidemic mitigation strategy. As a conclusion, the FTOPSIS model provide a beneficial guidance to the health authorities in Malaysia on the most to the least importance factors should be given priority for the dengue control under epidemic mitigation strategy. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

Technology-based solution was also being developed to prevent medication errors. Handwritten prescriptions that were difficult to read were replaced by computer-based prescription orders. In addition, anomaly detection machine learning algorithm was also used to automatically detect prescription dosage errors. SVM was a machine learning method that can solve both linear and nonlinear problems with good performance classification accuracy rate. However, SVM performance depended on the parameter selection, such as kernel, C, and γ. Multiple Grid Search Particle Swarm Optimization (MGSPSO) was proposed to get optimal SVM parameter. The comparative experiment on medication error detection showed that the MGSPSO provided higher accuracy rate, compared to other methods applied to this problem. In this experiment, MGSPSO could increase Grid Search and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) accuracy rate about 3%. MGSPSO also could decrease Grid Search recognition time. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

A good medical personnel schedule can overcome a lot of troubles for operational staff, management and the medical personnel. This problem can be solved using single objectives optimization and multi objectives optimization. In previous research, the scheduling optimization problem was solved single-objectively using Native Binary Particle Swarming Optimization (NBPSO). In this research, the researcher attempted to solve the problem multi-objectively using Non-Dominated Sorting Native Binary Particle Swarming Optimization (NSNBPSO). In this research, a constraint handling method was proposed called deallocation method which produced schedules that met the requirement of all constraints. In the performance comparison, researcher compared the performance of the proposed NSNBPSO and the previous NBPSO. The metrics used for the comparison were Coverage Rate, Hypervolume and Processing Time.NSNBPSO successfully produced 10 Solutions which provided more options to the stakeholder. However, NSNBPSO produced infeasible solutions and violated constraints in this research. Therefore, deallocation method was proposed and implemented to help NSNBPSO producing feasible solutions. The performance result showed that NSNBPSO with deallocation method had 35% more average hypervolume value than NBPSO, 50% of solutions from NSNBPSO dominated solution from NBPSO in coverage rate evaluation. However, it needed 85% more processing timeandcan still be considered acceptable. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Task scheduling is one of the technologies that have been applied to solve those objectivities. However, task scheduling is one of the well-known NP-hard problems, and it is difficult to find the optimum solution. To solve this problem, previous studies have utilized a meta-heuristic method to find the best solution based on the solution spaces. This study aims to compare four meta-heuristic such as the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Clonal Selection Algorithm (CSA), and Bat Algorithm (BA) to solve the multi-objective task scheduling to achieve the optimum solution. This study converts three objectivities into single objectivity optimization with each objectivity act as variable assigned with the weight that presents its priority and has implemented those meta-heuristics. The simulation result from sixteen datasets that have been grouped into three for a small dataset, medium dataset, and large dataset. In small and medium dataset BA able to outperforms others while in large dataset PSO shows better performance. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Therefore determining the time frame beforehand will make easier to predict the trend of stock movements within a certain time period. Stock prediction analysis method which was quite popular among traders until now was to used candlesticks. Candlestick patterns were often used by stock prediction analysis in several centuries ago. The form of candlestick could infer the direction of prices. CNN, RNN and LTSM were currently widely used for forecasting in stock prediction movement. The most suitable method for image datasets was CNN. In this paper, we presented CNN and candlestick approach to recognize an image to identify the strength of a trend pattern in the prediction movement of stock. Based on our experiment, CNN with candlestick approach can produce up to 99.3% accuracy overall. Therefore, this method can produce good accuracy. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

This paper is going to focus on the integration of ISO 20001 as SMS standard, ITIL v3 as the framework, and ISO 27001 as ISMS standard. We are going to discuss how the ITIL V3 can be combined with ISO 20001 and ISO 27001 by scientifically matching the similarities of process, procedure, and resources. This paper contributes to providing a guideline for an IT organization that is going to implement SMS and ISMS standard and framework.

They can use deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM). However, a weakness of LSTM is that it tends to overfit to the training data and have unstable results. To overcome this weakness, this paper proposes using Averaged Stochastic Gradient Descent and Weight-Dropping on an LSTM network (AWD-LSTM). The proposed model regularizes the network by weight-dropping with DropConnect and optimizes the training process using a Non-Monotically Triggered Averaged Stochastic Gradient Descent (NT-ASGD). Additionally, this paper tested with integrating historical data with textual data which was shown to be valuable by other studies. This paper evaluated six variants of the model with different regulizers, optimizers, and data.

It is like a summary to reflect the quality of all element inside a movie. People prefer to use rating as reference to decide before deciding to watch a movie or not. It is important to predict movie rating before it is released to maintain the objectivity of the movie rating. Many existing researches failed to address this problem because they used the post-release elements such as social media comments to predict movie rating. The other problem is the predicted rating is not intended for general people. Several researches used collaborative filtering, however the rating found was intended for specific people. To address limitations from previous researches, this study used historical values of the movie as features. Historical values could be generated from pre-released elements from the movie, it was created from relation between movie which based on movie similar attributes such as actor, director, genres, content rating, and production companies. By using historical values, objective prediction can be made even before the movie released. The proposed method was intended to make more accurate and general prediction for movie rating. In this study, usage of historical features and convolutional neural network (CNN) as model showed promising result. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

In Indonesia, one of the requirements to graduate from high school is to pass national mathematics examination. Many schools provided question bank to facilitate students in practicing mathematics. Unfortunately, the mathematics problems in question bank are not classified well, since the one who input the mathematics problem is not always a mathematics teacher. Hence, the problems should be labeled manually so administrator is able to know which topic and subtopic that problem had. It made students difficult to find the precise problem of math based on topic or subtopic. This research presents the classification of mathematic problem written with LaTeX based on topic and subtopic by using rule-based natural language processing, modified Term-Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Naive Bayes as a text mining algorithm. 780 mathematics problems are used in this research consisting of 18 topics and 52 subtopics from senior high school curriculum. The accuracy of this text mining is 91%. With this research question bank will be classified automatically that simplify administrator to input the mathematics problem into database and make it easier to students to find mathematics problem based on topic and subtopic. © 2020 ICIC International.

Previous study has suggested that improvement on neighborhoods and smart intensification of a TS could produce faster and fitted solution. In order to enhance the TS, this paper introduces an improvement to the neighborhoods and explores on the neighborhoods exploitations of TS to solve the NRP. The methodology consists of two phases: Initialization and neighborhood. The semi-random initialization is employed for finding a good initial solution during the initialization phase which avoids the violation of hard constraints, while the neighborhood phase is established for further improving the solution quality with a special representation and innovative neighborhood generations within TS algorithm. The aim is to move sample points towards a high-quality solution while avoiding local optima by utilising a calculated force value. It is observed that the enhancement strategy could improve the solution quality of the constructed roster. It is concluded that the TS with enhancements approach is able to assign effective and efficient shift duties for the NRP especially when related with real-world working regulations and nurses preferences. © 2020 R.

Many existing researches about movie rating prediction failed to address this problem because they usedthe post-release elements such as social media comments to predict movie rating. Our previous study addressed this problem by using historical features and other features that obtained before movie is released. In this study we used the features that we found in our previous. This study focused on optimizing the one-dimension CNN that we used on our previous study. Several studies were conducted to proposed technique to optimize DNN. We combined several optimization techniques such as regularization, activation function, optimizer, loss function and batch normalization to optimized CNN. The implementation of several techniques such as ReLU, dropout, Adam, L2 weight regularizer and batch normalization proved to give performance boost in our CNN model. After hyperparameter tuning is completed, our CNN model proved to give promising result by having the best performance compared to other machine learning models such as SVR and ANN. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Technically, most encryption processes are ranging from hundreds of milliseconds. If there is a lot of encrypting process, then the performance will be getting bottleneck and the transaction's speed is being slowed down. In this paper, a promising scheme by adding GZIP compression on the former RSA encryption method to increase speed is proposed; thus every transaction is going to require less times, therefore the number of failed transactions or requests will be reduced. Hence, this way makes the transaction easier for customers to do. The result of little experimental test shows that using XOR to stream cipher-text to replace the absent of padding into specific bytes shows a lot of performance increase resulting other factors such as availability also affected without sacrificing the security level. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Risk management; Systems engineering; Application Servers; Experimental test; RSA encryption; Security level; Stream Ciphers; Cryptography",,,,,,"Rachmawati, D., Budiman, M.A., Lubis, R.S., (2018) IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 434, pp. 1-6; Baheti, A., Singh, L., Khan, A.U., (2014) IEEE-Fourth International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies, pp. 664-668; Ahmed, M., Sazzad, T.M.S., Mollah, M.E., (2012) Int J Comput Sci Issues, 9, pp. 583-586; Klein, M., (2012) The TSEC/KW-26 (1st Ed.)

In this paper, Multi-Objective is used to solve problems with mathematical models and is applied to overcome nurse scheduling problems. Health is one of the essential things in human life. There are some departments in the hospital which serve the patients in the hospital, and one of them is the nursing department. The nurses in this department serve the patients every time, but they have limited time as the working hour must not be more than schedule 8 hours. So, there will be a problem in this aspect, especially the working for each nurse because the nurses must be stand by to serve the patients every time. The scheduled operation will be complicated, so we propose a solution by Genetic Algorithm method. The scheduling making by applying Genetic Algorithm method will give more optimal and faster output comparing with a current or manual process. © BEIESP.","Genetic algorithm; Multi-objective; Nurse; Nurse scheduling; Optimizing; Scheduling problem",,,,,,,"McCartney, G., Popham, F., McMaster, R., Cumbers, A., Defining health and health inequalities (2019) Public Health, 172, pp. 22-30; Yeung, T., Local health department adoption of electronic health records and health information exchanges and its impact on population health (2019) International Journal of Medical Informatics, 128, pp. 1-6; Bard, J.F., Purnomo, H.W., Cyclic preference scheduling of nurses using a lagrangian-based heuristic (2007) Journal of Scheduling, 10, pp. 5-23; Tsai, C.C., Li, S.H.A., A two-stage modeling with genetic algorithms for the nurse scheduling problem (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36, pp. 9506-9512; Warner, M., Scheduling Nursing Personnel According to Nursing Preference: A mathematical programming approach (1976) Operations Research, 24, pp. 842-856; Banet, D., Heuristic scheduling for clinical physicians (2009) Thinkir: The University of Louisville's Institutional Repository; Knjazew, D., A competent genetic algorithm for solving permutation and scheduling problems (2002) Genetic Algorithms and Evolutionary Computation, 6. , Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, ISBN: 0792374606; Dodaro, C., Maratea, M., (2017) Nurse Scheduling via Answer Set Programming”, , Springer International Publishing AG; Chen, T., Li, J., Jin, P., Cai, G., Reusable rocket engine preventive maintenance scheduling using genetic algorithm (2013) Reliability Engineering & System Safety, 114, pp. 52-60; Baker, K.R., (1974) Introduction to Sequencing and Scheduling, , New York; Singh, J., Auluck, N., (2017) Controlled Duplication Scheduling of Real-Time Precedence Tasks on Heterogeneous Multiprocessors, pp. 3-21. , Spriger International Publishing; Agyei, W., Obeng-Denteh, W., Andaam, E., Modeling Nurse Scheduling Problem Using 0-1 Goal Programming: A Case Study Of Tafo Government Hospital, Kumasi-Ghana (2015) INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH, 4 (3). , MARCH; Mubarak, S., (2015) Construction Project Scheduling and Control”, , New Jersey: Sons Inc; Cheng, M.Y., Prayogo, D., (2014) Symbiotic Organisms Search: A New Metaheuristic Optimization Algorithm, , Elsevier; Branke, J., Deb, K., Miettinen, K., Slowinski, R., (2014) Multiobjective Optimization, , Germany: Springer; Haupthaupt, R., (2004) Pratical Genetik Algorithms, , New Yersy: John Wiley and Sons,Inc; Hiassat, A., Diabat, A., Rahwanc, I., (2017) A Genetic Algorithm Approach for Location-Inventory-Routing Problem with Perishable Products, , Elsevier; Gencheng, M., “Genetik Algorithm for Scheduling of Laboratory personnel (1997) Clinical Chemistry, pp. 118-123; Pinedo, M.L., (2012) Scheduling: Theory, Algorithms, and Systems, , USA: Springer-Verlag New York","Wibowo, A.; Computer Science Department, Indonesia; email: a.wibowo2003@gmail.com",,,"Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication",,,,,22773878,,,,"English","Int.

KPCA and α-regression quantile were used to handle the issue of linearity and outliers, respectively. While, AGA was performed to obtain regression coefficients of the nonlinear optimization of α-regression quantile.

In the scheduling, a mathematical model is developed to represent personnel arrangement in a hospital. Afterward, we need algorithm to solve the mathematical model in which they can be exact or metaheuristic algorithm. Exact algorithm can provide a global optimum in the solution, however finding optimal solution for complex and vast number of constraints is time consuming since physician scheduling is NP-Hard problem. on the other hand, metaheuristic approach provides solution to the scheduling problems in much less time compared to exact algorithm. Therefore, metaheuristic approach is considered more appropriate to solve physician scheduling problem. In this paper, we conduct a preliminary review of the latest population bases approaches in hospital related scheduling, especially Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based algorithms, to understand strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and recommend the most suitable one applicable to solve physician scheduling problem. Future work will be suggested for further improvements on the algorithm. © 2018 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Healthcare; Medical Resources; Metaheuristic; Operation Research; Physicians; Scheduling","Artificial intelligence; Computational complexity; Genetic algorithms; Health care; Hospitals; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Pattern recognition; Problem solving; Medical Resources; Meta heuristic algorithm; Meta-heuristic approach; Metaheuristic; Operation research; Optimal solutions; Physicians; Scheduling problem; Scheduling",,,,,,"Erhard, M., Schoenfelder, J., Fügener, A., Brunner, J.O., State of the art in physician scheduling (2018) European Journal of Operational Research, 265 (1), pp. 1-18; Gunawan, A., Lau, H.C., Master physician scheduling problem (2013) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 64 (3), pp. 410-425; Alharbi, A., Alqahtani, K., (2016) A Genetic Algorithm Solution for the Doctor Scheduling Problem, 1, pp. 91-97; Lo, C.-C., Lin, Lin, T.-H., A particle swarm optimization approach for physician scheduling in a hospital emergency department (2011) Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation; Kennedy, J., Eberhart, R.C., A discrete binary version of the particle swarm algorithm (1997) IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

Therefore, we cannot utilize a prediction technique to forecast the water level directly. To overcome this difficulty, we used Ordinary Linear Regression (OLR) and mean substitution to handle the imperfect data and to make the data meaningful. ARIMA and SARIMA are well known techniques and widely used in time series forecasting. Unfortunately, they produce a linear regression model that may improper model for water level forecasting. Instead, Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous Model (NARX) are alternative techniques to address the issue of linearity in regression. Nevertheless, they also have difficulties to determine the optimal network and regression coefficients/weights due to the randomness of their initial weights. Under this circumstance, we proposed Multiple BPNN and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to overcome the limitation of ARIMA/SARIMA, standalone BPNN and NARX. Our experiment showed that our proposed technique is superior compared to ARIMA, SARIMA, BPNN and NARX. © International Association of Engineers.","Genetic algorithm; Missing data; Neural network; Water level","Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Linear regression; Neural networks; Water levels; Autoregressive exogenous models; Back-propagation neural networks; Linear regression models; Missing data; Multiple neural networks; Regression coefficient; Time series forecasting; Water level forecasting; Water resources",,,,,,"Ekhwah, M.T., Juahir, H., Mokhtar, M., Gazim, M.B., Abdullah, S.M.S., Jaafar, O., ""Predicting for Discharge characteristics in Langat River, Malaysia using Neural Network Application Model"" (2009) Research Journal of Earth Sciences, 191, pp. 15-21; Gasim, M.B., Adam, J.H., Toriman, M.E., Rahim, S.A., Juahir, H., ""Coastal Flood Phenomenon in Terengganu, Malaysia: Special Reference to Dungun"" (2007) Research Journal of Environmental Sciences, 1, pp. 102-109; (2002) Laporan Banjir 2000/2001, , Unit Hidrologi Jabatan Pengairan dan Saliran Negeri Terengganu; (2009) Flood Forecasting and Warning System Report, , Unit Hidrologi Jabatan Pengairan dan Saliran Malaysia; Zhang, G.P., ""Time Series Forecasting Using Hybrid ARIMA and ANN Model"" (2002) Neurocomputing, 50, pp. 159-175; Suguna, N., Thanuskodi, K.G., ""Predicting Missing Attribute Values using K-means Clustering"" (2011) J.

Several variants of QAP have been proposed by researchers in the past in order to reflect the real situations of QAP. One of the real problems of QAP is related with facilities which are required to be assigned to certain locations due to its function. In solving this problem, a fixed assignment has to be made thus allowing for the complexity of the problem to be reduced. Hence, this study introduces Quadratic Assignment Problem with Fixed Assignment (QAPFA) with the objective to minimize the assignment cost between the facility and location. This assignment takes into account the flow and distance between facility and location. QAPFA represents the real-world situation of the problem especially in dealing with specific requirement of some facilities to specific locations. Dataset of QAPFA is introduced and is solved using branch and bound approach. As for validation, the results of QAPFA are compared with QAP in terms of objective function and running time. The computational results show that the solution quality of QAPFA is lower when compared with the QAP, while the running time for QAPFA is lower than the QAP. Since the complexity of the problem is reduced by fixing the assignment, thus there is possibility that QAPFA has lower quality than QAP due to the fixed assignment. Nevertheless, in terms of running time QAPFA is better than QAP. It can be concluded that this problem reflect the real problem and practical to be used. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Branch and bound method; Combinatorial optimization; Location; Branch-and-bound approaches; Computational results; Objective functions; Quadratic assignment problems; Real situation; Real world situations; Solution quality; Specific location; Problem solving",,,,,,"Benjaafar, S., (2002) Management Science, 48 (5), p. 679; Duman, E., Or, I., (2007) Computers & Operations Research, 34 (1), p. 163; Rabak, C.S., Sichman, J.S., (2003) Advanced Engineering Informatics, 17 (2), p. 95; Steinberg, L., (1961) Siam Review, 3 (1), pp. 37-50; Geoffrion, A., Graves, G.W., (1976) Operations Research, 24 (4), p. 595; Malucelli, F., (1993) Bulletin-European Association for Theoretical Computer Science, p. 533; Grötschel, M., (1992) ICIAM, p. 119; Jünger, M., Martin, A., Reinelt, G., Weismantel, R., (1994) Mathematical Programming, 63 (1-3), p. 257. , 3; Heffley, D.R., (1977) Optimal Strategies in Sports, p. 169; Koopmans, T., Beckmann, M., (1957) Econometrica, 25 (1), p. 53; Steinberg, L., (1961) Siam Review, 3 (1), p. 37; Burkard, R.E., Rissner, R., (2011) Journal of Combinatorial Optimization, 22 (4), p. 845; Pierskalla, W.F., (1967) Technical Memorandum No. 93, Operations Research Department, CASE Institute of Technology, September, , http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/william.pierskalla/Chronological_Bank/Research_and_Publication_Chro.html#Mathematical; Mittelmann, H.D., Salvagnin, D., (2015) Mathematical Programming Computation, 7 (2), pp. 219-234; Domschke, W., Forst, P., Voß, S., (1992) New Directions for Operations Research in Manufacturing, p. 389; Drwal, M., (2014) Optimization Letters, 8 (3), p. 1183; Burkard, R.E., Çela, E., Klinz, B., (1994) Quadratic Assignment and Related Problems, 16, p. 117. , ed P.M.

Recently, researchers have used nonlinear programming models, soft-computing approaches, and hybrid of them to estimate the surface roughness of abrasive waterjet (AWJ) machining. Some researchers have performed a second order polynomial regression (SOPR) as a basis in developing a nonlinear programming in AWJ machining. Nevertheless, the SOPR was developed without considering the existence of multicollinearity which can lead to inappropriate prediction. Besides, it also needs a specific nonlinear regression model in advance. It will be difficult to specify an appropriate nonlinear model of SOPR since it does not usually involve all combination variables in its model. Instead, kernel principal component regression (KPCR) will be employed to overcome the weaknesses of the SOPR. After development and model selection in the KPCR models, the best KPCR is used as an objective function in a nonlinear programming model of AWJ with a certain set of constraints. Single genetic algorithm (GA) and its variants can be conducted to solve the nonlinear programming problem. However, they can yield different decision values due to randomness of their initial population which implies that the best decision values may not converge in a certain optimum solution. Under this circumstance, multiple adaptive probabilities genetic algorithm (MAPGA) combined with a penalty method to solve the optimization problem is proposed. Hybrid of KPCR and MAPGA gives more stable solution compared to hybrid of KPCR with single genetic algorithm and original adaptive probabilities genetic algorithm. Our proposed technique also provides an optimum solution in reasonable time. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Abrasive waterjet; Adaptive genetic algorithm; Machining process; Multicollinearity; Nonlinear; Penalty method; Polynomial regression; Principal component; Probability; Regression; Robust; Second order","Abrasives; Constrained optimization; Genetic algorithms; Jets; Machining; Nonlinear programming; Principal component analysis; Probability; Regression analysis; Soft computing; Structures (built objects); Surface roughness; Abrasive water-jet; Adaptive genetic algorithms; Machining Process; Multicollinearity; Nonlinear; Penalty methods; Polynomial regression; Principal Components; Regression; Robust; Second orders; Optimization",,,,"Binus University","The author would like to express a sincere gratitude to the anymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions to improve the quality of this manuscript.

This technique has been widely used to devise initial solutions for issues concerning vehicle routing. Basically, the waste collection cycle involves the following steps: i) each vehicle starts from a depot, ii) visits a number of customers to collect waste, iii) unloads waste at the disposal site, and lastly, iv) returns to the depot. Moreover, the sample data set used in this paper consisted of six areas, where each area involved up to 103 customers. In this paper, the NG technique was employed to construct an initial route for each area. The solution proposed from the technique was compared with the present vehicle routes implemented by a waste collection company within the city. The comparison results portrayed that NG offered better vehicle routes with a 11.07% reduction of the total distance traveled, in comparison to the present vehicle routes. © 2017 Author(s).",,,,,,"Universiti Utara Malaysia, UUM

Therefore, an effective decision on a landfill site selection in order to identify the most suitable area as a new landfill is very important. Since 25 years ago, the integration of geographic information systems (GIS) and multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) has drawn significant interest among researchers. This integrated technique is commonly used for land use planning and selecting a new landfill site is one of the plan. This paper proposes a framework of landfill site selection with a consideration of resource requirement. This framework is developed by using the integration of GIS and MCDA to identify an appropriate location for landfill siting. A list of selection criteria obtained from the literature considered in selecting the best landfill site is also presented. The results of this study could later be used to help the waste management team in developing an efficient solid waste management system. © 2016 Author(s).",,,,,,"Universiti Utara Malaysia, UUM

In essence, the nature of the course timetabling problem is to assign a lecturer-course entity to existing teaching venue and timeslot in an academic institution. In this article, the authors propose a Genetic Algorithm-Neighborhood Search (GANS) to construct a feasible timetable for courses offered by a department in the faculty of a local university in Malaysia. The framework of the solution is as follow: The feasible timetable is first constructed by Genetic Algorithm, which includes are pair operator which attempts to repair infeasible timetables. Upon feasibility, the second phase exploits the initial feasible solution using three neighborhood structures to search for an improved solution and global optimum. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the various neighborhood structures in exploiting the feasible solutions to yield the global optimum. © 2016 Chong-Keat Teoh, Habibollah Haron, Antoni Wibowo and Mohd.

Even though data mining has been successful in becoming a major component of various business processes and applications, the benefits and real-world expectations are very important to consider. It is also surprising to note that very little is known to date about the usefulness of applying knowledge discovery in transport related research. From the literature, the frameworks for carrying out knowledge discovery and data mining have been revised over the years to meet the business requirements. The Domain Driven Data Mining (DDDM) is one of the KDD frameworks often used for this purpose. In this study, we apply DDDM-KDD for formulating effective tire maintenance strategy within the context of a Malaysian's logistics company. We also discussed the weaknesses of the results from DDDM-KDD and emphasize the important of using the next generation of KDD framework Actionable Knowledge Discovery (AKD) for an effective decision.

First, to theoretically examine the profit sharing (mudarabah) contract that produces an optimal distribution of return in the presence of social learning (shuratic process) within the environment of asymmetric information. Second, to empirically investigate the optimal condition of profit sharing ratio (PSR) and social learning for profit sharing (mudarabah) contract in Islamic banking. Design/methodology/approach - Data from one of the biggest and earliest Islamic banks in Malaysia were taken as a proxy of Islamic bank. The data are collected from the period of 2009 to 2013 and it will be used for the simulation process by utilizing the genetic algorithm technique. Findings - The empirical results discovered that Islamic bank had utilized social learning in their daily activities especially in the asset side. The results also showed the trend of social learning has a positive relationship with the trend of Islamic bank‟s net profit. Additionally, the results also indicated that the Islamic bank‟s net profit has a positive relationship with its PSR from the profit sharing (mudarabah) financing and securities investment. Originality/value -This study is the first of its kind that investigates the implementation of the social learning process in Islamic banking operation. We also utilized the latest technique from Artificial Intelligent (AI) system, i.e. a genetic algorithm (GA) to attain an optimal value for PSR and social learning process. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.

Biogeography-based optimization (BBO), a relatively new optimization technique based on the biogeography concept, uses the idea of migration strategy of species to derive algorithm for solving optimization problems. It has been shown that BBO provides performance on a par with other optimization methods. A classical BBO algorithm employs the mutation operator as its diversification strategy. However, this process will often ruin the quality of solutions in QAP. In this paper, we propose a hybrid technique to overcome the weakness of classical BBO algorithm to solve QAP, by replacing the mutation operator with a tabu search procedure. Our experiments using the benchmark instances from QAPLIB show that the proposed hybrid method is able to find good solutions for them within reasonable computational times. Out of 61 benchmark instances tested, the proposed method is able to obtain the best known solutions for 57 of them. © 2016 Wee Loon Lim et al.",,"Algorithms; Benchmarking; Combinatorial optimization; Ecology; Heuristic algorithms; Problem solving; Tabu search; Algorithm for solving; Biogeography-based optimization algorithms; Biogeographybased optimizations (BBO); Combinatorial optimization problems; Diversification strategies; Optimization problems; Optimization techniques; Quadratic assignment problems; Optimization; algorithm; animal; artificial intelligence; biological model; computer simulation; human; migration; Algorithms; Animals; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Simulation; Human Migration; Humans; Models, Biological",,,,,,"Sahni, S., Gonzalez, T., P-complete approximation problems (1976) Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery, 23 (3), pp. 555-565; Loiola, E.M., De Abreu, N.M.M., Boaventura-Netto, P.O., Hahn, P., Querido, T., A survey for the quadratic assignment problem (2007) European Journal OfOperational Research, 176 (2), pp. 657-690; Wang, J.-C., A multistart simulated annealing algorithm for the quadratic assignment problem (2012) Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Conference on Innovations in Bio-Inspired Computing and Applications (IBICA12), pp. 19-23. , Kaohsiung, Taiwan, September; Tosun, U., On the performance of parallel hybrid algorithms for the solution of the quadratic assignment problem (2015) Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 39, pp. 267-278; Czapiński, M., An effective parallel multistart tabu search for quadratic assignment problem on CUDA platform (2013) Journal of Parallel AndDistributed Computing, 73 (11), pp. 1461-1468; Misevicius, A., An implementation of the iterated tabu search algorithmfor the quadratic assignment problem (2012) OR Spectrum, 34 (3), pp. 665-690; Tosun, U., Dokeroglu, T., Cosar, A., A robust island parallel genetic algorithm for the quadratic assignment problem (2013) International Journal of Production Research, 51 (14), pp. 4117-4133; Tosun, U., A new recombination operator for the genetic algorithm solution of the quadratic assignment problem (2014) Procedia Computer Science, 32, pp. 29-36; Lstibůrek, M., Stejskal, J., Misevicius, A., Korecký, J., El-Kassaby, Y.A., Expansion of the minimum-inbreeding seed orchard design to operational scale (2015) Tree Genetics and Genomes, 11 (1), pp. 1-8; Ramkumar, A.S., Ponnambalam, S.G., Jawahar, N., A population-based hybrid ant system for quadratic assignment formulations in facility layout design (2009) International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 44 (5-6), pp. 548-558; Burkard, R.E., Cela, E., Pardalos, P.M., Pitsoulis, L., The quadratic assignment problem (1998) Handbook of Combinatorial Optimization, pp. 241-338. , P.

In profit sharing (mudarabah) contract, the realized profit is influenced by information. In this study, we provide suggestion in mitigating the principal-agent problem and increasing the returns of the contracting parties through the shuratic process (mutual consultation). Hence, the objective of this study is to empirically examine the optimal condition of profit sharing ratio (PSR) and shuratic process for profit sharing contract based on a simulation technique for Islamic banking in Malaysia. The results showed that the trend of shuratic process has a positive relationship with the trend of Islamic bank’s net profit. Additionally, the results also indicated that the Islamic bank’s net profit has a positive relationship to the Islamic bank’s profit sharing ratio (PSR) for profit sharing (mudarabah) financing and securities investment activities. On the other hand, there is a negative relationship between the Islamic bank’s PSR from return on financial and securities investment activities and the entrepreneur’s PSR. The results also revealed that there is a positive relationship between the PSR for investment saving accounts and the Islamic bank’s net profit.

The curriculum-based course timetabling problem confronts the problem of a multi-dimensional search space and matrices of high conflict-density, thus impeding the task to search for an improved solution. In this paper, the authors propose an arbitrary heuristic room matching algorithm which attempts to improve the initial seed of the curriculum-based course timetabling problem.

The nature of the problem concerns with the assignment of lecturers-courses to available teaching space in an academic institution. The Curriculum-Based University Course Timetabling Problem (CB-UCTP) has a high conflict-density and searching for an improved solution is not trivial. In this study, the authors propose a heuristic room matching algorithm which improves the seed of the CB-UCTP. The objective is to provide a reasonable search point to carry out any improvement phase and the results obtained indicate that the matching algorithm is able to provide very promising results as the fitness score of the solution is significantly enhanced in a very short period of time. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2015.","Curriculum-based course timetabling problem; Initial seed; Room matching algorithm; University course timetabling problem",,,,,,,"Abdullah, S., Turabieh, H., On the use of multi neighbourhood structures within a Tabubased memetic approach to university timetabling problems (2012) Inform.

Since different uncontrollable and unpredictable parameters are affecting selection, choosing the best supplier is a complicated process. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a method for measuring efficiency and inefficiencies of Decision Making Units (DMUs). DEA has been employed by many researchers for supplier selection and widely used in SSP with inputs for supplier evaluation. However, the DEA still has some disadvantages when it is solely used for SSP. Hence, in this paper, a combination of DEA and Neural Network (NN), DEA-NN, is proposed for SSP. We also develop a model for SSP based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) to improve the stability of DEA-NN. The proposed method was evaluated using small and large data sets. The experimental results showed that, the proposed method solve the problems connected to the previous methods. The results also showed that stability of proposed method is significantly better than DEA-NN method. In addition, CCR-SVR model overcome shortcomings such as instability and improves computational time and accuracy for predicting efficiency of new small and large DMUs. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

The consequences of obesity on numerous aspects of life are thoroughly explored in the existing literature. For instance, evidence shows that obesity is linked to incidences of diseases such as heart disease, type-2 diabetes, and some cancers, as well as psychosocial problems. To respond to the increasing trends in the UK, in 2008 the government set a target to reverse the prevalence of obesity (POB) back to 2000 levels by 2020. This paper will outline the application of system dynamics (SD) optimization to simulate the effect of changes in the eating behavior of British children (aged 2 to 15 years) on weight and obesity. This study also will identify how long it will take to achieve the government's target. This paper proposed a simulation model called Intervention Childhood Obesity Dynamics (ICOD) by focusing the interrelations between various strands of knowledge in one complex human weight regulation system. The model offers distinct insights into the dynamics by capturing the complex interdependencies from the causal loop and feedback structure, with the intention to better understand how eating behaviors influence children's weight, body mass index (BMI), and POB measurement. This study proposed a set of equations that are revised from the original (baseline) equations. The new functions are constructed using a RAMP function of linear decrement in portion size and number of meal variables from 2013 until 2020 in order to achieve the 2020 desired target. Findings from the optimization analysis revealed that the 2020 target won't be achieved until 2026 at the earliest, six years late.

The increasing of water level is influenced by some factors which called the predictor variables such as month, rainfall, temperature, relative humidity and surface wind. The data for this analysis including the predictors and water level as response were collected from Water Resources Management and Hydrology Division Department of Irrigation and Drainage Malaysia and Malaysian Meteorological Department. However, we noticed there are missing values in the collected data. The selection of suitable predictor variables useful for developing prediction model since the analysis data uses many variables. The suitable predictor variables are selected using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Cross Validation to obtain an appropriate predictive water level of Galas River Kuala Krai. We take into account the K-fold cross-validation for determining of the dominant variables and best model. However, we need to perform pre-processing data of the datasets since the original data contain missing values. We perform two types of pre-processing data using mean (type I pre-processing data) and Ordinary Linear Regression (type II pre-processing data) to overcome the existing of the missing values. Our experimental result shows that the Gaussian kernel is the suitable kernel function with type I pre-processing data for the predicting water level in Galas River.","Cross validation; Galas River; Kelantan; Missing value; Nonlinear regression; Support vector regression; Variables selection; Water level","Autocorrelation; Data handling; Forecasting; Information management; Regression analysis; Rivers; Water levels; Cross validation; Kelantan; Missing values; Non-linear regression; Support vector regression (SVR); Variables selections; Water resources",,,,,,"Davison, A.C., Hinkley, D.V., (1997) Bootstrap Methods and their Application, Cambridge Series in Statistical and Probabilistic Mathematics, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Smola, A.J., Scholkopf, B., A tutorial on support vector regression (2003) NeuroCOLT2 Technical Report Series; Mevik, B.H., Cederkvist, H.R., Mean squared error of prediction (MSEP) estimates for principle component regression (PCR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) (2004) Journal of Chemometrics, 18 (9), pp. 422-429; Cranganu, C., Breaban, M., Using support vector regression to estimate sonic log distributions: A case study from the anadarko Basin (2013) Oklahoma, Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, 103, pp. 1-13; Wu, C.H., Tzeng, G.H., Lin, R.H., A novel hybrid genetic algorithm for kernel function and parameter optimization in support vector regression (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36, pp. 4725-4735; Sivapragasam, C., Liong, S.Y., Pasha, M.F.K., Rainfall and runoff forecasting with SSA-SVM approach (2001) Journal of Hydroinformatics, 3 (3), pp. 141-152; Alexander, D., (1993) Natural Disasters, , UCL Press, London; Ying, E., Application of support vector regression algorithm in colleges recruiting students prediction (2012) International Conference on Computer Science and Electronics Engineering; http://www.codeforge.com/read/7180/svmSim.m_html; French, J.G., Holt, K.W., Floods (1989) The Public Health Consequences of Disasters, US Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, pp. 69-78. , M.B.

Conditions of bearings commonly are reflected by vibration signals data. In multiple bearing condition diagnosis, it will involve many types of vibration signals data; thus, consequently, it will involve many features extraction to obtain precise condition diagnosis. However, large number of features extraction will increase the complexity of the diagnosis system. Therefore, in this paper, we presented a diagnosis method which is hybridization of adaptive genetic algorithms (AGAs), back propagation neural networks (BPNNs), and grey relational analysis (GRA) to diagnose the condition of multiple bearings system. AGAs are used in the diagnosis algorithm to determine the best initial weights of BPNNs in order to improve the diagnosis accuracy. In addition, GRA is applied to determine and select the dominant features from the vibration signal data which will provide good diagnosis of multiple bearings system in less features extraction. The experiments results show that AGAs-BPNNs with GRA approaches can increase the accuracy of diagnosis in shorter processing time, compared with the AGAs-BPNNs without the GRA. © 2014 Lili A.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are one of the most popular methods for classification in condition diagnosis of bearing systems. Regarding to ANNs performance, ANNs parameters have important role especially connectivity weights. In several running of learning processes with the same structure of ANNs, we can obtain different accuracy significantly since initial weights are selected randomly. Therefore, finding the best weights in learning process is an important task for obtaining good performance of ANNs. Previous researchers have proposed some methods to get the best weights such as simple average and majority voting. However, these methods have some limitations in providing the best weights especially in condition diagnosis of bearing systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid technique of multiple classifier-ANNs (mANNs) and adaptive probabilities in genetic algorithms (APGAs) to obtain the best weights of ANNs in order to increase the classification performance of ANNs in condition diagnosis of bearing systems. The mANNs are used to provide several best initial weights which are optimized by APGAs. The set optimized weights from APGAs, afterward, are used as the best weights for condition diagnosis. Our experiment shows mANNs-APGAs give better results than of the simple average and majority voting in condition diagnosis of bearing systems. This experiment also shows the distinction of maximum and minimum accuracy in mANNs-APGAs is lower than the two existing methods. © 2014, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

It is essential to detect bearing faults early to avoid unexpected breakdown of plant due to undetected faulty bearings. Many meta-heuristics techniques for condition diagnosis of single bearing systems have been developed. The techniques, however, are not effectively applicable for multiple bearing systems. In this paper, a new hybrid technique of genetic algorithms (GAs) with adaptive operator probabilities (AGAs) and back propagation neural networks (BPNNs), called AGAs–BPNNs, is proposed specifically for condition diagnosis of multiple bearing systems. In this technique, AGAs are integrated with BPNNs to attain better initial weights for the BPNNs and hence reduce their learning time. We tested the proposed technique on a two bearing systems, and used ten extracted features from the system’s vibration signals data as input and sixteen bearing condition classes as target output. The experimental results show that the AGAs–BPNNs technique obtains much higher classification accuracy in shorter CPU time and number of iterations compared with the standard BPNNs, and the hybrid of standard GAs and BPNNs. © 2014, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Adaptive operator probabilities; Back propagation neural networks; Condition diagnosis; Genetic algorithms; Multiple bearings","Algorithms; Backpropagation algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Maintenance; Neural networks; Probability; Adaptive operators; Back propagation neural networks; Bearing conditions; Classification accuracy; Genetic algorithm (GAs); Manufacturing industries; Multiple bearings; Number of iterations; Backpropagation",,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE",,"Harris, T.A., Kotzalas, M.N., (2007) Rolling bearing analysis: essential concepts of bearing technology, , Taylor and Francis Group, London:; Harnoy, A., (2003) Bearing design in machinery: engineering tribology and lubrication, , Marcel Dekker Inc., New York:; Rodriguez, P.V.J., Arkkio, A., Detection of stator winding fault in induction motor using fuzzy logic (2008) Appl Soft Comput, 8, pp. 1112-1120; Min, X., Fanrang, K., Fei, H., An approach for bearing fault diagnosis based on PCA and multiple classifier fusion.

Every year, floods affecting biodiversity on this region and also causing property loss of this residential area. The residents in Kelantan always suffered from floods since the water overflows to the areas adjoining to the rivers, lakes or dams. Months, average monthly rainfall, temperature, relative humidity and surface wind were used as predictors while the water level of Galas River was used as response. The selection of suitable predictor variables becomes an important issue for developing prediction model since the analysis data uses many variables from meteorological and hydrogical departments. In this study, we conduct K-fold Cross- Validation (CV) to select the important variables for the water level predictions. A suitable prediction model is needed to forecast the water level in Galas River by adopting the Ordinary Linear Regression (OLR) and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). However, we need to perform pre-processing data of the datasets since the original data contain missing data. We perform two types of pre-processing data which are using mean of the corresponding months (type I pre-processing data) and OLR (type II preprocessing data) of missing data. Based on the experiment, PLSR is more suitable model rather than OLR for predicting the water level in Galas River and the use of the type I pre-processing data gives higher accuracy than the type II pre-processing data.","Cross-validation (cv); Galas river; Ordinary linear regression (olr); Partial least squares regression (plsr); Water level",,,,,,,"Alexander, D.E., Natural Disasters (1993) Springer Science and Business, p. 632. , 1st Edn, New York, ISBN-10: 0412047411; Bennett, K.P., Embrechts, M.J., An optimization Perspective on Kernel Partial Least Squares Regression (2003) Advances In Learning Theory: Methods, Models and Applications, pp. 227-250. , Suykens, J.A.K.

However, the criteria are naturally conflicted even with flexibilities and/or constraints appeared in the logistic networks. This paper is concerned with three-level logistic networks with potential suppliers, distributed centers (DCs), and deterministic demands from available consumers. The networks also benefit from potential direct shipments from suppliers to consumers as long as suppliers and DCs facilities might face limited capacity in their own seasonal supplying and warehousing processes. The goal is (re)configure the networks in order to minimize response time to consumers, transportation cost and facility cost. Therefore, the networks are formulated as multiple criteria decision making problems, which have more than one configuration through the time and cost optimizing at the same time. Due to the flexibility and the constraints, the decision maker(s) needs a set of compromise solutions for the networks that represent optimal configurations based on the objectives without considering prior knowledge. To this end, the problems are formulated into four individual logistic network models varying with the flexibility option and/or the capacitated facilities. To find the compromise solutions, Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, NSGA-II is customized and then utilized to deal with an illustrative case study. The results are analyzed through the two performance measures, hypervolume and the number of optimal solutions obtained so far. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Flexible logistic network model; Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective optimization; Pareto solutions","Capacitated facilities; Deterministic demand; Logistic networks; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Multiple criteria decision-making problems; Pareto solution; Performance measure; Transportation cost; Decision making; Evolutionary algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Costs",,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank Universiti Tekno-logi Malaysia and Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for supporting and funding this research through the Fundamental Reserach Grant Scheme (FRGS) - Vot 78502.","Aslam, T., Ng, A.H.C., Multi-objective optimization for supply chain management: A literature review and new development (2010) 8th International Conference on Supply Chain Management and Information Systems: Logistics Systems and Engineering, , Hong Kong; Bader, J.M., (2009) Hypervolume-based Search for Multiobjective Optimization: Theory and Methods, , Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich; Baker, K., Adaptive selection methods for genetic algorithms (1987) 2th International Conference on Genetic Algorithms, pp. 100-111. , J.

The purpose of using ball bearing is to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads. Diagnosis of bearing vibration data is an important process to identify either the bearing is normal or defect. In this paper, we consider a single bearing system that consists of one normal or defect Fan End (FE) bearing in which an accelerometer is attached to both normal and defect FE bearing to capture the vibration data. These vibration data are grouped into several samples data. Five parameters are extracted from each sample to be used as the input in neural network model and class of target output is either normal or defect. Those five parameters are standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, absolute mean and root mean square. Our objectives are to find the dominant parameters and the best model for fault diagnosis of single bearing system. It is important to find the dominant parameters since the selection of dominant parameter can reduce the pre-processing data phase. According to our observation that the dominant parameter is either of standard deviation, absolute mean or root mean square and the best BPNN model is the model with one input neuron and one neuron in hidden layer. © February 2013 IJENS.","Back propagation neural network; Bearing system; Dominant parameters; Fault diagnosis",,,,,,,"Harnoy, A., Bearing Design in Machinery: Engineering Tribology and Lubrication (2003) Marcel Dekker Inc, pp. 224-226; Rodriguez, P.V.J., Arkkio, A., Detection of Stator Winding Fault in Introduction Motor Using Fuzzy Logic (2008) Applied Soft Computing 8, pp. 1112-1120; Wulandhari, L.A., Wibowo, A., Desa, M.I., Hybrid Neural Network-Genetic Algorithm for Fault Diagnosis of Bearing System (2011) Proceeding of Industrial Engineering and Service Science, pp. 1-6; Wang, H., Chen, P., Fault Diagnosis for A Rolling Bearing Used in A Reciprocating Machine by Adaptive Filtering Technique and Fuzzy Neural Network (2009) WSEAS TRANSACTION on SYSTEMS Issue, 7, pp. 1-6; Lei, Y., He, Z., Zi, Y., Application of An Intelligent Classification Method to Mechanical Fault Diagnosis (2009) Expert Systems with Applications 36, pp. 9941-9948; Huang, Y.C., Huang, C.M., Sun, H.C., Liao, L.S., Fault Diagnosis Using Hybrid Artificial Intelligent Methods (2010) 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications, pp. 41-44; Li, W., Shi, T., Liao, G., Yang, S., Feature Extraction and Classification of Gear Faults Using Principal Component Analysis (2003) Journal of Quality in Maintenance Engineering Vol. 9 No., 2, pp. 132-143; Patan, K., Artificial Neural Networks for the Modelling and Fault Diagnosis of Technical Process (2008) Springer, pp. 256-258; Hassoun, M.H., Fundamentals of Artificial Neural Networks, Asoke K.

However, most these algorithms rely on such a central (re) division that affects the algorithms' efficiency. This paper first proposes a local MOEA that searches on a particular region of objective space with its novel evolutionary selections. It effectively searches for Pareto Fronts (PFs) inside the given polar-based region, while nearby the region is also explored, intelligently. The algorithm is deliberately designed to adjust its search direction to outside the region - but nearby - in the case of a region with no Pareto Front. With this contribution, a novel island model is proposed to run multiple forms of the local MOEA to improve a conventional MOEA (e.g. NSGA-II or MOEA/D) running along - in another island. To dividing the search, a new division technique is designed to give particular regions of objective space to the local MOEAs, frequently and effectively. Meanwhile, the islands benefit from a sophisticated immigration strategy without any central (re) collection, (re) division and (re) distribution acts. Results of three experiments have confirmed that the proposed island model mostly outperforms to the clustering MOEAs with similar division technique and similar island models on DTLZs. The model is also used and evaluated on a real-world combinational problem, flexible logistic network design problem. The model definitely outperforms to a similar island model with conventional MOEA (NSGA-II) used in each island. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

With this technique, many parallel and distributed multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (dMOEAs) on different island models have been proposed to search for optimal solutions, efficiently and effectively. These algorithms often use local MOEAs on their islands in which each local search is considered to find a part of optimal solutions. The islands (and the local MOEAs), however, need to communicate to each other to preclude the possibility of converging to local optimal solutions. The existing dMOEAs rely on the central and iterative process of subdividing a large-scale population into multiple subpopulations; and it negatively affects the dMOEAs performance. In this paper, a new version of dMOEA with new local MOEAs and migration strategy is proposed. The respective objective space is first subdivided into the predefined number of polar-based regions assigned to the local MOEAs to be explored and exploited. In addition, the central and iterative process is eliminated using a new proposed migration strategy. The algorithms are tested on the standard bi-objective optimization test cases of ZDTs, and the result shows that these new dMOEAs outperform the existing distributed and parallel MOEAs in most cases. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Bi-objective optimization problems; Distributed multi-objective evolutionary algorithms; Island models; Migration strategy","Iterative methods; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal systems; Bi-objective optimization; Evolutionary search; Island model; Local optimal solution; Migration strategy; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs); Optimal solutions; Evolutionary algorithms",,,,"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia","Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to Dr. Farahnaz Kaze-mipour from UTM, the anonymous associate editor.

In this machining, we need to minimize and to obtain as low as possible the surface roughness by determining the optimum values of the three parameters. In previous works, some researchers used a response surface methodology (RSM) and a soft-computing approach, which was based on ordinary linear regression and genetic algorithms (GAs), to estimate the minimum surface roughness and its corresponding values of the parameters. However, the construction of the ordinary regression models was conducted without considering the existence of multicollinearity which can lead to inappropriate prediction. Beside that it is known the relation between the surface roughness and the three parameters is nonlinear, which implies that a linear regression model can be inappropriate model to approximate it. In this paper, we present a technique developed using hybridization of kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) based nonlinear regression and GAs to estimate the optimum values of the three parameters such that the estimated surface roughness is as low as possible. We use KPCA based regression to construct a nonlinear regression and to avoid the effect of multicollinearity in its prediction model. We show that the proposed technique gives more accurate prediction model than the ordinary linear regression's approach. Comparing with the experiment data and RSM, our technique reduces the minimum surface roughness by about 45.3% and 54.2%, respectively. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In terms of water levels, DID have introduced three categories of critical level stages namely normal, alert and danger levels. One of the rivers detected by DID that had reached danger level is Sungai Dungun located at Dungun district, Terengganu. The aim of this study is to find suitable prediction model of water level with input variables monthly rainfall, rate of evaporation, temperature and relative humidity taken from the same catchment at Dungun River using Neural Networks based Nonlinear Time Series Regression methods which are Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) and nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (NARX) networks. The variables selection criteria procedures are also developed to select a significant explanatory variable. In addition, the process of pre-processing data such as treatment of missing data has been made on the original data collected by DID and MMD. The methods are compared to obtain the best model for prediction water level in Dungun River. Based on the experiments, the NARX model with five predictor variables is the best model compared to BPNN. In addition, treatment of missing data using mean and OLR approach produced comparable results for this case study. © 2012 Science Publications.","BPNN; Dungun river; Missing data; NARX; Terengganu; Time series regression; Water level",,,,,,,"Arbain, S., Wibowo, A., Time series methods for water level forecasting of Dungun river in Terengganu Malaysia (2012) Int.

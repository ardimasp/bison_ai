Therefore, a landless planting method is needed to supply the food for society. Hydroponics is one of the solutions for gardening methods using water as a nutrition media. Traditionally, hydroponic farming conducted manually by monitoring the nutrition such as acidity or basicity (pH), the value of total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), and nutrient temperature. In this research, we propose a system that measures pH, TDS, and nutrient temperature values in the nutrient film technique (NFT) technique using a couple of sensors. We use lettuce as an object of experiment and apply the KNN (k-Nearest Neighbor) algorithm to predict the classification of nutrient conditions. The result of prediction is used to provide a command to the microcontroller to turn on or off the nutrition controller actuators simultaneously at a time. The experiment result shows that the proposed KNN algorithm achieves 93.3% accuracy when k=5. © 2019 IEEE.","Hydroponic; k-nearest neighbor; pH; TDS","Alkalinity; Controllers; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Man machine systems; Motion compensation; Nutrients; Nutrition; pH; Text processing; Crowded urban areas; Electrical conductivity; Hydroponic; K-nearest neighbors; Nutrient conditions; Nutrient film techniques; Temperature values; Total dissolved solids; Nearest neighbor search",,,,,"Roser, M., Hannah, R., Ortiz-Ospina, E., World population growth (2019) Our World in Data, , https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth, [Online]; Ritxchie, H., Roser, M., Urbanization (2018) Our World in Data, , https://ourworldindata.org/urbanization, [Online]; Roberto, K., (2000) How-To Hydroponics, , Third.

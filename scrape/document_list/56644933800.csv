Land use change from open space area into settlements and business area has increased surface runoff that causing flooding. Also, activities in these areas had caused groundwater pollution and groundwater level declined. Groundwater recharge well is one of many methods to increase groundwater level by utilizing storm water infiltration. Thus, storm water that causing inundation could be converted to recharge the groundwater. This research was performed quality and quantity analysis to study existing groundwater condition. The hydrochemistry of groundwater in all sampling locations shows high NH4 ranging from 2.3 mg/L to 19.02 mg/L indicate groundwater contamination suspected originated from domestic/non domestic waste or septic tank leakage. Also, one of five sampling locations shows Na and EC value which exceeds the permissible limit that might due to salt intrusion. Regarding groundwaterlevel for Cengkareng area, the result shows that there is a significant groundwater level decline at ’deeper confined aquifer (>140)’ wells from 2005 to 2013. The groundwater level trend line shows that the groundwater level will continue to decrease in the future. There is no groundwater decline at ‘above confined aquifer (40-140 m)’ wells, but groundwater level is very low at around -58 m AMSL. This could be the result of intensive groundwater withdrawal that has been occurring years ago until now. Hence, groundwater recharge in this area is critical, in order to restore groundwater storage. Therefore, the artificial recharge of storm water, will work on reducing the groundwater pollutant and increasing the water level. Finally, the design of infiltration wells was completed using Sunjoto Formula and rainfall data of Cengkareng, with soil permeability of 14x10-6 m/s. © Research India Publications.","Cengkareng; Groundwater level; Hydrochemical characteristics; Recharge well",,,,,,"Djaja, R., Rais, J., Zabidin, H., Wedyanto, K., (2004) Land Subsidence of Jakarta Metropolitan Area, , https://www.fig.net/pub/jakarta/papers/ts_06/ts_06_4_djaja_etal.pdf, Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia.

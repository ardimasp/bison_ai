The concept of e-Learning is a transformation of conventional learning into digital form. The concept of e-Learning is now widely known and can be accepted in the community as evidenced by the many applications in the world of education and business. The aim to be achieved in this study is to implement e-Learning to PT MRK Diagnostics and find out whether or not there are inhibiting factors in implementing e-Learning to PT MRK Diagnostics. The method used to obtain recommendations after using e-Learning uses the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) method to find out the impression of using e-Learning that affects employee performance. Edmodo e-Learning has positive impression values in the Attractiveness (1,950), Perspicuity (2,100), Efficiency (1,775), Dependability (1,575), Stimulation (1,125), and Novelty (0.875) groups. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

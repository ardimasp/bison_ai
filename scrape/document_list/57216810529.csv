A lot of studies have been done to understand the effects of knowledge creation on performance. Although there are a lot of empirical research related with knowledge creation, but the review on the research direction of knowledge creation is still limited. This paper gives insight on knowledge creation and performance, analyzes the empirical research, and provide future direction. The method used for this research is literature review by collecting and analyzing empirical Scopus articles from 2014 until 2020 by using two keywords: 'knowledge creation' AND performance also SECI AND performance. Result shows that research in knowledge creation has been done in various countries and industries, with the term knowledge creation process and SECI indicators widely used to represent knowledge creation. More research is still needed to show how knowledge creation affects performance. © 2020 IEEE.","Knowledge creation; Knowledge creation process; Literature review; Performance","Competitive strategy; Empirical research; Empirical studies; Knowledge creations; Literature reviews; Information management",,,,,"Sin, A.B., Zailani, S., Iranmanesh, M., Ramayah, T., Structural equation modelling on knowledge creation in six sigma dmaic project and its impact on organizational performance (2015) Intern.

The research framework of this research consists of several factors and indicators, namely efficiency (4 indicators), Reliability (4 indicators), security (3 indicators), Convenience (3 indicators), Ease of use (4 indicators). This study uses an online survey with google form for users of self-service technology services in 5 major cities in Indonesia. Dissemination of the survey for three months, and the obtained were 100 respondents valid. This research conducts testing using Smarpls v3.0. The results of this study found two factors that influence perceived usefulness, namely: efficiency and reliability, and found three factors that did not have an impact, namely Security factors, Convenience Factors, Perceived Ease of use, and Service Trust do not have an impact on perceived usefulness. This result is a very interesting finding because during the period pandemic COVID-19. These factors are no longer the top priority in the use of SST services and do not affect who intention to use a technology service. Thus, it can be concluded that whose intention at a certain level of the problem will prioritize the reliability and efficiency of the system for service. This factor can be the focus of the company in developing systems that adopt Self-service technology. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

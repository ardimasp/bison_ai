Water utilization in hydroponics system is more efficient compared to cultivation system using soil media. The water that has been mixed with the mineral nutrients required by the plant is continuously flowed into the roots of the plant. Another advantage of this method is very suitable to be applied in limited land such as urban home environment. Most urban activities are mostly done outside the home, like activities for work, school, shopping and others. Thus, it is seen that the observation of the hydroponics system becomes not easy to do. An example is the observation of the flow of water is the most important factor in the hydroponics system to ensure the plants get adequate supply of nutrients. Water level, water temperature, and water pH are some other factors that exist in hydroponic systems that need to be observed periodically to determine the appropriate action. This problem can be solved by developing smart monitoring based on Internet of Things technology on hydroponics system so that the observation can be done from a distance and can be reported directly through telegram instant messaging.

But if the user goes into the room or building, then the human tracking application cannot get the user's position as the GPS signal cannot get through the wall. By using RFID, human tracking application can perform tracking in a certain closed area by providing room's or building's information that is entered. The IP camera as part of the system will send the images as visualization inside the room. In this research, human tracking system is built on a specific area that has lots of room or building such as a theme park or sports club. System is designed using an RFID reader, RFID tags, IP Camera, the database server and Android smartphones. The research was done inside Syahdan Campus, Bina Nusantara University - Jakarta.

The location that is in the closed area and consists of lots of room to play therein will have many challenges when it is developed by using the Global Positioning System (GPS). In the developed system is also necessary to know the location of the children monitored in real time. The use of Radio Frequency ID (RFID) is expected to answer the needs mentioned above. The system developed consists of RFID readers that is installed at the entrance or exit, RFID tags that is carried by the child, a database server that is used to upload data from RFID readers and also an application that is installed on a smart phone that is used to upload the registration data to the database server and download data from the database server to be displayed on the smartphone. Application that is developed to build this system is also equipped with other features such as user info and add friend. User info is used to determine the time of the last tapping did by the child. Add Friend is used to add a child that is to be monitored into the system. In this application, the number of children that can be monitored is limited to 5 children. With accuracy up to 100% at the time of tapping and mapping, systems and applications are developed is reliable to answer the needs. © 2017 ACM.","Android smart phone; RFID; System monitoring","Android (operating system); Broadband networks; Database systems; Global positioning system; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Signal encoding; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Android smart phones; Android smartphone; Data-base servers; Monitoring system; Radio Frequency ID (RFID); RFID readers; RFID sensors; System monitoring; Monitoring",,,,,,"Miskelly, F., Electronic tracking of patients with dementia and wandering using mobile phone technology (2005) Age and Ageing, 34 (5), pp. 497-518; Nicholson, R.J., Brown, T.G., Caracciolo, A., Jr., Scribner, J.R., Tracking system (1991) Software US 5014206 A, , May 7; Elgethun, K., Yost, M.G., Fitzpatrick, C.T.E., Nyerges, T.L., Fenske, R.A., Comparison of global positioning system (GPS) tracking and parent-report diaries to characterize children's time-location patterns (2006) Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology, 17, pp. 196-206. , June; Van Der Spek, S., Van Schaick, J., De Bois, P., De Haan, R., Sensing human activity: GPS tracking (2009) Sensors, 9 (4), pp. 3033-3055. , April; Zhang, D., Xia, F., Yang, Z., Yao, L., Zhao, W., Localization techonolgy for indoor human tracking (2010) 5th International Conference on Future Information Technology (Future Tech), pp. 1-6. , Busan; Werb, J., Lanzl, C., Designing a positioning system for finding things and people indoors (1998) IEEE Spectrum, 35 (9), pp. 71-78. , September; Gu, Y., Lo, A., Niemegeers, I., A survey of indoor positioning systems for wireless personal networks (2009) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 11 (1), pp. 13-32. , March; Ran, L., Helal, S., Moore, S., Drishti: An integrated indoor/Outdoor blind navigation system and service (2004) The Second IEEE Annual Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications, pp. 23-30; Zaruba, G.V., Huber, M., Kamangar, F.A., Chlamtac, I., Indoor location tracking using RSSI readings from a single wi-fi access point (2007) Journal Wireless Networks, 13 (2), pp. 221-235. , April; Renaudin, V., Yalak, O., Tomé, P., Merminod, B., Indoor navigation of emergency agents (2007) European Journal of Navigation, 5 (3), pp. 1-10. , July; Jin, G.-Y., Lu, X.-Y., Park, M.-S., An indoor localization mechanism using active RFID tag (2006) IEEE International Conference on Sensor Networks, Ubiquitous, and Trustworthy Computing, , Taichung; Tsuboi, T., Shiraishi, T., Komuro, N., Indoor human positioning tracking technique to support high-quality life (2009) International Joint Conference, pp. 5745-5749. , Japan; Gupta, A.K., Katiyar, S., Kumar, N., Railway track finding system with RFID application (2013) International Journal of Computer Aplication, 836 (7), pp. 24-30. , December; Gerdisen, Y., Solid, V., Wahyudi, O., Hutabarat, D.P., Hedwig, R., Human tracking in a certain closed area based on global positioning system (GPS) (2014) Internetworking Indonesia Journal, 6 B (1), pp. 3-6",,,"","Association for Computing Machinery","5th International Conference on Communications and Broadband Networking, ICCBN 2017","20 February 2017 through 22 February 2017",,128004,,9781450348614,,,"English","ACM Int.

In this paper, the research was continued by combining radio-frequency identification (RFID) and GPS in order to get better human tracking in both indoor and outdoor area. For indoor tracking, an RFID tag was carried by a user and continually read whenever he/she accessed a room while GPS was used mainly when the user was staying outdoor. GPS would be automatically activated whenever the user leaved the room 3 meters away. The accuracy of this tracking was 100% and the GPS could allocate the user every 3.27 meters. Thus this application is suitable to track the human position for both indoor and outdoor. © 2016 IEEE.","ADB; GPS; human tracking; raspberry pi; RFID","Radio frequency identification (RFID); Human Tracking; Indoor tracking; RF-ID tags; Global positioning system",,,,,,"Gerdisen, Y., Solid, V., Wahyudi, O., Hutabarat, D.P., Hedwig, R., Human tracking in a certain closed area based on global positioning system (GPS) (2014) Internetworking Indonesia Journal, 6 (1 B), pp. 3-6; Zhang, D., Xia, F., Yang, Z., Yao, L., Zhao, W., Localization technologies for indoor human tracking (2010) 5th International Conference on Future Information Technology, pp. 1-6. , Busan; Tesoriero, R., Tebar, R., Gallud, J.A., Lozano, M.D., Penichet, V.M.R., Improving location awareness in indoor spaces using RFID technology (2010) Expert Systems with Applications, 37 (1), pp. 894-898. , January; Guillemette, M.G., Fontaine, I., Caron, C., Hybrid RFID-GPS real-time location system for human resources: Development, impacts and perspectives (2008) 41st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, p. 406. , Waikoloa; Pejic, A., Pletl, S., Pejic, B., An expert system for tourists using google maps API (2009) 7th International Symposium on Intelligent Systems and Informatics, Subotica, pp. 317-322; Höflinger, F., Zhang, R., Hoppe, J., Bannoura, A., Reindl, L.M., Wendeberg, J., Bührer, M., Schindelhauer, C., Acoustic self-calibrating system for indoor smartphone tracking (ASSIST) (2012) International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN), Sydney, pp. 1-9; Richardson, M., Wallace, S., (2013) Getting Started with Raspberry Pi, , First Edition ed., B.

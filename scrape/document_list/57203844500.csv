Since fashion is the most favorite item category in Indonesia, there are lots of fashion e-commerce grown in the country. One of the unsatisfactory conditions that are occurred in fashion e-commerce in Indonesia is user drop off. By using funnel analysis, the product detail page of fashion e-commerce founded as the page with the most user drop off. To tackle this problem, several experiments were prepared. With A/B testing, the experiments that possibly improved the conversion rate were identified. This research discovered experimental version of the User Interface (UI) of the product detail page by manipulating button colors, layout, and delivering comprehensible information to users. © 2020 IEEE.","A/B testing; Conversion rate; E-commerce; Funnel analysis; User drop off","Drops; Electronic commerce; Information management; A/b testing; Conversion rates; Indonesia; Item category; Physical stores; Product and services; User interfaces",,,,,,"(2019) Most Purchased Products on 11. 11 Shopping Event Amongst Respondents in Indonesia As of November 2018 by Category, , Statista.com, Statista. com; Maulia, E., (2019) Indonesia Seeks Lead in Global Modest-fashion Industry; Muller, J., (2019) Most Popular E-commerce Sites for Fashion in Indonesia As of 3rd Quarter 2019, by Monthy Web Visits, , Statista.com2; Rahutomo, R., Perbangsa, A.S., Soeparno, H., Pardamean, B., Embedding model design for producing book recommendation (2019) Proc. 2019 Int.

COVID-19 was since being the headlines of the news offline and online. This trigger either positive or negative responses from the readers, which in turn affect at least the depth of understanding and furthermore the effectiveness of any enforced intervention taken with the purpose to control the transmission of the COVID-19. In order to assess how likely the COVID-19-containing news being forwarded to reach more readers and how the pertinent news bridge further virtual interaction, we crawled data from Twitter as the major online microblogging platform to analyze how likely COVID-19-containing tweets were echoed and what typical tweet about COVID-19 that gained attentions. This is critical to evaluate how people virtually responded against the tweets. Our analyzed data is visualized using Matplotlib by Python and Graph Prism8 accordingly. We figured out that timing and number of followers are not determinative for the tweets being retweeted. Instead, provoking headline add likelihood for the tweets to be moving forward. Also appeared in our analysis that the top two media (Detik and Kompas) shared the same proportion on their tweet type fractions on where information dominated the fraction of their tweets. © 2020 IEEE.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Retweet; Tweet; Twitter","Electronic assessment; Information management; Coronaviruses; Indonesia; Micro-blogging platforms; Offline; Virtual interactions; Social networking (online)",,,,,,"Adhikari, S.P., Meng, S., Wu, Y., Mao, Y., Ye, R., Wang, Q., (2020) Epidemiology, Causes, Clinical Manifestation and Diagnosis, Prevention and Control of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) during the Early Outbreak Period: A Scoping Review, pp. 1-12; (2020) Novel Coronavirus-Japan (Ex China), , https://www.who.int/csr/don/17-january-2020-novel-coronavirusjapan-ex-china/en/, Accessed 9 April 2020; (2020) COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic, , https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/, Worldometer.

One of the possible solutions for this is to adaptively adjust appliances utilization according to activity level in the building. Thus, an intelligent activity estimation system needs to be developed. However, massive annotated dataset is necessary to train the system. Therefore, we propose a system that enables rapid data annotation to collect the massive dataset. With the proposed system, an image can be annotated within 4.8 seconds in average. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Activity levels; Data annotation; Energy usage; Estimation systems; Intelligent energies",,,,,,"Minoli, D., Sohraby, K., Occhiogrosso, B., (2017) IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 4 (1), pp. 269-283; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1097-1105; Szegedy, C., Liu, W., Jia, Y., Sermanet, P., Reed, S., Anguelov, D., Erhan, D., Rabinovich, A., (2015) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1-9; He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Sun, J., (2016) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 770-778; Huang, G., Liu, Z., Van Der Maaten, L., Weinberger, K.Q., (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 4700-4708; Hu, J., Shen, L., Sun, G., (2018) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 7132-7141; Redmon, J., Divvala, S., Girshick, R., Farhadi, A., (2016) 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 779-788; Ren, S., He, K., Girshick, R., Sun, J., (2017) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 39 (6), pp. 1137-1149; Lin, T.Y., Dollár, P., Girshick, R., He, K., Hariharan, B., Belongie, S., (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2117-2125; Lin, T.Y., Goyal, P., Girshick, R., He, K., Dollár, P., (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 2980-2988; Kovashka, A., Russakovsky, O., Fei-Fei, L., Grauman, K., (2016) Foundations and Trends in Computer Graphics and Vision, 10 (3), pp. 177-243; Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L., (2009) 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (Ieee), pp. 248-255; Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Bernstein, M., (2015) International Journal of Computer Vision, 115 (3), pp. 211-252; Sun, C., Rampalli, N., Yang, F., Doan, A., (2014) Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 7 (13), pp. 1529-1540; Cenggoro, T.W., Tanzil, F., Aslamiah, A.H., Karuppiah, E.K., Pardamean, B., (2018) IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 195, p. 012063; Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L., (2014) European Conference on Computer Vision (Springer), pp. 740-755",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

For automation, an intelligent system needs to be developed. However, an intelligent system needs to be trained in a large dataset before it can be used reliably. In this paper, we present a transfer learning scheme to develop an intelligent system for smart building management system. Specifically, the intelligent system is able to count human inside a room, which can be utilized to adaptively adjust energy usage in a room. The transfer learning scheme employs a deep learning model that is pretrained on ImageNet dataset. To enable the human counting capability, the model is trained on a dataset specifically collected for human counting case. © 2019, The Author(s).","Building management system; Deep learning; Human counting;

Recommendation system plays a major role to formulate and produce a series of recommendation based on users' behavior. Surprisingly, user-generated scoring or known as ratings are the main raw materials to learn the pattern of favorable contents of each user. As a part of collaborative filtering strategy, rating is considerable to be included in formulating recommended contents. In this research, the basic formulation to recommend books is discovered. The recommendation system has been tested on one random-picked user behavior and successfully has generated five recommended books by analyzing prior activities. The embedding model produced the recommended books with 59% of accuracy. This research is done to provide an insightful experience for developing content recommendation system in Binus University's corporate learning system. © 2019 IEEE.","collaborative filtering; rating; recommendation system; recommended literatures","Behavioral research; Collaborative filtering; Embeddings; Information management; Learning systems; Rating; Basic formulation; Content recommendations; Internet services; Model design; recommended literatures; User behaviors; User-generated; Recommender systems",,,,,,"Ricci, F., Shapira, B., Rokach, L., Recommender systems: Introduction and challenges (2015) Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 7-8. , Second Edition; Davidson, J., The YouTube video recommendation system (2010) Proc.

The existence of bridge structural health monitoring system is necessary for bridge maintenance due to its ability to process data and provide the information of structural health level. This research is performed to design a deep neural network model for classifying structural integrity with high accuracy. The model requires input data in the form of F-statistic, which is derived from structural vibration data. In the current approach, the vibration data are obtained from numerical analysis by means of the finite element methods. As much as 17.493 vibration cases are generated for five levels of structural integrity, namely, healthy conditions and conditions of 1%, 5%, 10%, 20% damage level. The neural network model consists of one input layer of 20 neurons, six hidden layers with 12 neurons per layer, and one output layer of 5 neurons. The model is trained by using Adam optimizer. The results show that the model is able to accurately classify the structural damage at 83.3% accuracy, and the majority of the false predictions occur in differentiating the healthy structural condition from those of 1% damage. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Artificial Neural Network; Classification Accuracy; Deep Learning; Structural Health Monitoring; Vibration-based",,,,,"Binus University","This research was finished under support from BINUS – NVIDIA Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Center in BINUS University Anggrek Campus, Jakarta, Indonesia.

The Academic Information System provides valuable raw data. However, unprocessed information alone is insufficient for the diagnosis of problem areas within an education institution. Due to the complex nature of educational management, there is a need for an application that can identify critical patterns and trends within an educational institution's current activities. The data warehouse in the study serves the center for data collection and integration. Gathered data can then be accessed for queries and analysis, generating insights crucial for improving an institution. The purpose of this study was to build a data warehouse model that can display useful information for education management support. The data warehouse design methodology was based on the nine-step methodology proposed by Kimball. The method of data collection included questionnaires, interviews, formal observations, and literature review. Visual Basic.Net 2008, SQL Server 2005 and Crystal Reports were used as tools to design the model. © 2018 IEEE.","data warehouse; education management; model; nine-step methodology","Data warehouses; Information use; Models; Pattern recognition; Surveys; Data collection; Education institutions; Education management; Educational institutions; Educational management; Literature reviews; nine-step methodology; Warehouse design; Data acquisition",,,,,,"Pardamean, B., Muljo, H.H., Suparyanto, T., Masli, E., Prabowo, H., Donovan, J.D., Team based learning as an instructional strategy: A comparative study (2017) New Educ.

For instance, one of the cases in PA, automated plant counting, is able to accelerate the process of plantation monitoring. Despite many previous researches have developed information system for PA, there is no system which can be used for plant counting automation. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce an information system design that is crafted for automated plant counting.

In recent years, machine learning has gained significant attentions as a way to build a classifier from labeled data which also can be implemented to build a gender classifier. In this study we develop gender classifier using two different datasets with different languages, English and Bahasa Indonesia. Each data from both datasets is represented by 20 acoustic features. Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) is used to build the classification model using all these features and trained only on English dataset. This model is evaluated in both dataset to get the performance matrices consist of accuracy, AUROC, precision and recall. Ultimately, using this model we also identify and compare important features from both dataset to see the different characteristics of English and Bahasa Indonesia speeches. © 2019 The Authors.

Despite of the rapid advancement in medical image analysis with the rise of deep learning, development of breast cancer detection system is limited due to relatively small size of the publicly available mammogram dataset. In this paper, we discover an effective configuration for transfer learning from Chest X-Ray pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network to overcome the small-size mammogram dataset problem. We found that the best configuration achieve 90.38% validation accuracy for modified. © 2018 The Authors.

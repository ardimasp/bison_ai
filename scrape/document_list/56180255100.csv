However, the Black-Scholes formula is generally used in determining the price of the option does not involve skewness factor and it is difficult to apply in computing process because it produces oscillation for the skewness values close to zero. In this paper, we construct option pricing formula that involve skewness by modified Black-Scholes formula using Shifted Poisson model and transformed it into the form of a Linear Approximation in the complete market to reduce the oscillation. The results are Linear Approximation formula can predict the price of an option with very accurate and successfully reduce the oscillations in the calculation processes. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,"Martinkute-Kauliene, R., (2012) Business, Management and Education, 10 (2), pp. 289-301; Miller, L., Bertus, M., (2013) Business Education & Accreditation, 5; Sunaryo, T., (2009) Manajemen Resiko Finansial, , Salemba Empat, Jakarta; Zhu, Z., Hanson, F.B., (2013) Social Science Research Network; Gerber, H., Landry, B., (1997) North American Actuarial Journal, 1; Black, F., Scholes, M., (1973) Journal of Political Economy, 81; Hull, J.C., (2012) Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives, , Pearson Prentice Hall, New Jersey; Gerber, H., Shiu, E., (1996) Insurance: Mathematics and Economics, 18; Boyle, (1997) Financial Economics: With Applicationsin Insurance and Pensions, , Schaumburg: in press; Lin, S., (2009) Introductory Stochastic Analysis for Finance and Insurance, , John Willey & Sons, Inc, Canada; Gerber, H., Shiu, E., (1997) North American Actuarial Journal, p. 1",,,"","EDP Sciences","2013 International Conference on Advances Science and Contemporary Engineering, ICASCE 2013","23 October 2013 through 24 October 2013","Jakarta",,21016275,,,,"English","EPJ Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901411647

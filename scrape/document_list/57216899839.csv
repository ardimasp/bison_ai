With the increasing access to Internet usage in society, public access to P2P lending applications will also be more open. It is proven by the significant increase of transactions in P2P lending applications in current years. Previous research has focused more on the phenomenon of P2P lending growth and its relation to the existing financial ecosystem, namely banking, and research that focuses more on MSMEs as P2P lending application users. Therefore, we see the need for research to find out what factors influence the intention to use P2P lending applications, including knowing the positive impact of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, trust, user innovation, and government support for attitude towards using the P2P lending applications, and the positive impact of attitude towards use for behavioral intention to use P2P lending applications. The study was conducted by taking a sample of 150 people who had never applied a P2P lending application and were domiciled in Greater Jakarta. The data analysis method used for hypothesis testing was Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results show that trust and user innovativeness factors have a positive effect on attitude towards using P2P lending applications and attitude towards use has a positive effect on behavioral intention to use P2P lending applications. Meanwhile, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and government support do not have a positive impact on attitude towards utilizing P2P lending applications. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

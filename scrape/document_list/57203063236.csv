People can study whenever and wherever based on their availability and interest. The growth of e-learning in higher education has developed rapidly to accommodate the issue. This paper aimed to find out the key success factors of e-learning in higher education. Systematic Literature Review was conducted to reach the finding. 54 journal articles were examined to gain the result. The examined journal articles were published between 2006 up to 2016. The result showed that there were 17 key critical success factors of e-learning in higher education. The most critical factor was the IT infrastructure or the learning management system (LMS) followed by e-learning tools and e-learning models. The result also revealed that there was a paradigm shifting in learning process from traditional way. It was suggested the future focus of this research area to emphasize the implementation of LMS in e-learning so that e-learning in higher education can be implemented well. © 2017 IEEE.","CSFs; e-learning; higher education; SLR","Enterprise resource planning; Information management; Critical success factor; CSFs; E-learning models; Higher education; IT infrastructures; Key success factors; Learning management system; Systematic literature review; E-learning",,,,,"Barak, M., Watted, A., Haick, H., Computers & Education Motivation to learn in massive open online courses: Examining aspects of language and social engagement (2016) Computers & Education, 94, pp. 49-60. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2015.11.010; Arkoful, V., Abaidoo, N., (2014) The Role of E-learning, the Advantages and Disadvantages of Its Adoption in Higher Education, 2 (12), pp. 397-410; Anderson-Meger, J., (2011) Critical Thinking and E-Learning in Social Work Education, 1 (2), pp. 17-27; Ahmad, Z., Alabaddi, A., Rahahleh, A.H., Al-Omoush, M.M., (2016) Blended E-Learning Constraints from the Viewpoint of Faculty Members, 11 (7), pp. 180-190. , http://doi.org/10.5539/ijbm.v11n7p180; Alazmi, M., Zairi, M., (2017) Total Quality Management & Business Excellence, 3363. , http://doi.org/10.1080/1478336032000051386, January; Alhomod, S., Alsadhan, A.O., Shafi, M.M., (2014) The 3C' S Model: A Framework for Development of E-Learning Courses, 7 (1), pp. 87-93. , http://doi.org/10.5539/cis.v7n1p87; Alowayr, A., Badii, A., (2014) Review of M Onitoring Tools for E-learning Platforms, 6 (3), pp. 79-86. , http://doi.org/10.5121/ijcsit.2014.6306; Alsabawya, A.Y., Cater-Steel, A., Soar, J., IT infrastructure services as a requirement for e-learning system success (2013) Computers & Education, , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.035; Al-Samarraie, H., Teo, T., Abbas, M., Computers & Education Can structured representation enhance students' thinking skills for better understanding of E-learning content?

But not all of them are a healthy company that has a good financial condition. One of the methods to assess bank's financial performance is by using financial ratio analysis. To analyze all BPR financial condition using financial ratio analysis will require so many time and effort. That's why Business Intelligence is needed to provide a fast and reliable information for top management in Bank Andara to help them make decisions regarding their potential customer's financial condition. This paper will result in a design of a business intelligence application that will adhere to required financial ratios needed by management user to analyze BPR's financial condition and resulting in a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that will help them to make decisions. © 2018 IEEE.","bank's performance; business intelligence; financial ratio; rural bank","Competitive intelligence; Decision making; Information analysis; Information management; Bank performance; bank's performance; Business intelligence applications; Financial performance; Financial ratio analysis; Financial ratios; Potential customers; Top management; Finance",,,,,"Jasa Keuangan, O., (2017) Bank Perkreditan Rakyat, , http://www.ojk.go.id/id/kanal/perbankan/Pages/Bank, Otoritas Jasa Keuangan; Jasa Keuangan, O., (2017) Daftar Alamat Kantor Pusat BPR, , https://www.ojk.go.id/id/kanal/perbankan/data-danstatistik/Pages/Daftar-Alamat-Kantor-Pusat-BPR.aspx, Otoritas Jasa Keuangan; Palepu, K.G., Healy, P.M., Peek, E., (2013) Business Analysis and Valuation: IFRS Edition, , Cengage learning; Ubiparipović, B., Durković, E., Application of business intelligence in the banking industry (2011) Management Information System, 6 (4), pp. 23-30; Kimball, R., Ross, M., Thornthwaite, W., Mundy, J., Becker, B., (2008) The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit, , John Wiley Sons; Vercellis, C., (2011) Business Intelligence: Data Mining and Optimization for Decision Making, , Milano: John Wiley Sons; Kumbirai, M., Webb, R., A financial ratio analysis of commercial bank performance in South Africa (2010) African Review of Economics and Finance, 2 (1), pp. 30-53; Tugas, F.C., A comparative analysis of the financial ratios of listed firms belonging to the education subsector in the Philippines for the Years 2009-2011 (2012) International Journal of Business and Social Science, 3 (21), pp. 173-190; Harrison, W.T., Horngren, C.T., Thomas, C.W., (2012) Financial Accounting, , Pearson Higher Education AU; López-Espinosa, G., Moreno, A., De Gracia, F.P., Banks net interest margin in the 2000s: A macro-Accounting international perspective (2011) Journal of International Money and Finance, 30 (6), pp. 1214-1233; (2017) Investopedia Capital Adequacy Ratio, , http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitaladequacyratio.asp, Investopedia; Accounting Tools Debt to Equity Ratio, , http://www.accountingtools.com/debt-Toequity-ratio, Accounting Tools; Shingjergji, A., Hyseni, M., The determinants of the capital adequacy ratio in the albanian banking system during 2007-2014 (2015) International Journal of Economics, Commerce and Management, 3 (1), pp. 1-10; (2017) Understanding Banking Ratios, , http://www.activemediaguide.com/busedu_banking.htm, US Business Reporter; (2017) Kamus Bank Sentral Republik Indonesia, , http://www.bi.go.id/id/Kamus.aspx, Bank Indonesia Bank Indonesia; Michael, R., Pizzica, A.J., (2015) Financial Ratios for Executives, Apress; Den Van End, J.W., A macroprudential approach to address liquidity risk with the loan-To-deposit ratio (2016) The European Journal of Finance, 22 (3), pp. 237-253; Saaty, T.L., Vargas, L.G., (2012) Models, Methods, Concepts & Applications of the Analytic Hierarchy Process, 175. , Springer Science & Business Media; Understanding Bank Ratios, , http://www.activemediaguide.com/busedu_banking.htm, Activemedia-Guide, [Online].

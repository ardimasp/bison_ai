The use of Six Sigma method with DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) is expected to increase sigma level. Pareto diagram, Ishikawa diagram, and why-why analysis were utilized as tools to analyze the cause of defects on products. Three major packaging defects were identified, namely horizontal leak, folded, and vertical leaks, which were caused by machine A, machine B, machine C, respectively. Based on the results of the analysis, the main problem was caused by inappropriate condition of the machine part such as dirty sealer, hollow on nozzle, and worn stator pump. By focusing on improvements of the problem, sigma level increased from 4.58 to 4.79. Therefore, periodic maintenance activities are important to do so that all machines may perform in its best conditions and comply with internal and regulatory quality standards. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","DMAIC; Leaking; Quality; Six Sigma; Sweetened Condensed Milk Sachets","Defects; Image quality; Process monitoring; Six sigma; Work simplification; Condensed milk; Corrective actions; Define , measure , analyze , improve , and controls; DMAIC; Leaking; Packaging defects; Periodic maintenance; Six sigma methods; Process engineering",,,,,"Rapaka, M.P., Six sigma methods and formulas for successful quality management (2017) Int.

It actually could be potentially developed as a health-promoting food in the form of rosella jam. As the market for rosella jam in Indonesia is not established yet, and in the advent on the development of renewable energies in the 21st century, it is a fascinating idea to design a rosella jam factory employing solar energy as one of the renewable energies in the future that might lead the sustainable food business in Indonesia. The rosella jam factory is designed to produce 40000 bottles of rosella jam (weight: 250 g) per month, sold for Rp. 25000, rendering income of Rp. 1 billion per month. It needs a one-off capital cost of Rp. 2.56 billion for production equipments and machines (not including solar panels), with monthly manufacturing cost of 624 million (included 20 kW electricity) that will reach break-even point (BEP) at 13th month. Solar panels (mainly consists of 840 solar panels, 200 Wp working for 4 hours) worth of 2.64 billion is recommended to be installed on the 19th month to avoid negative cumulative net present value (CNPV). © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","BEP; CNPV; renewable energy; rosella; solar energy; solar panel","Chemical contamination; Manufacture; Solar cell arrays; Solar energy; CNPV; Health improvements; Manufacturing cost; Preliminary design; Production equipments; Renewable energies; rosella; Solar panels; Solar concentrators",,,,,"Muresan, C., Gbadamosi, A., Muste, S., Scrob, S., Rat, A., Study Concerning the Quality of Jam Products Based on Banana and Ginger (2014) J. of Agroalimentary Processes and Technologies, 20, pp. 408-411; Broomfield, R.W., (1996) The Manufacture of Preserves, Flavourings and Dried Fruits, p. 165; Margono, T., (1993) Buku Panduan Teknologi Pangan, , http://www.ristek.go.id, Accesed at 11 January 2018; Fachruddin, L., (1998) Memilih Dan Memanfaatkan Bahan Tambahan Makanan; Handarini, K., Potensi Ekstrak Bunga Rosella (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.

To enhance the model performance, the efforts implemented include optimizing the training process by applying sliding-windows methods and setting appropriate parameters. After obtaining the best settings, the proposed model was then compared with two other variants of the LSTM model, namely Vanilla LSTM and Stack LSTM. The model performance evaluation was done by finding Mean Square Error (MSE) and root mean square error values from training and testing process. The results show that there were increased performances from using sliding-windows method to optimize the training process and the appropriate parameter setting. Bidirectional LSTM model, along with the treatments implemented, gave the best performance compared to the two other models.

Several methods have been used to detect vulnerabilities in web applications such as black-box testing, dynamic analysis, and static analysis. In this article, we propose a framework for detecting web application vulnerabilities by combining all three methods. The strengths of one method are used to overcome the weaknesses of another method. This framework is believed to provide better results than if each method was used separately. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"This research was supported by Universitas Stikubank Semarang.

These works are implemented at the computers network layers. The stegblock will convert the transactions data which sent among network into other data's form, it means the data such as ID Number, Account Number, Passwords and others are converted with other data called cover. Finally, the system sends the cover without the real data, it just represented data and able to read by the receiver.

The complexity of the software can increase the possibility of defects. Defective software can cause high losses. Fixing defective software requires a high cost because it can spend up 50% of the project schedule. Most software developers don't document their work properly so that making it difficult to analyse software development history data. Software metrics which use in cross-project software defects prediction have many features. Software metrics usually consist of various measurement techniques, so there are possibilities for their features to be similar. It is possible that these features are similar or irrelevant so that they can cause a decrease in the performance of classifiers. In this study, several feature selection techniques were proposed to select the relevant features. The classification algorithm used is Naive Bayes. Based on the analysis using ANOVA, the SBS and SBFS models can significantly improve the performance of the Naïve Bayes model. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bayesian networks; Defects; Feature extraction; Sodium compounds; Classification algorithm; Development history; Measurement techniques; Performance of classifier; Relevant features; Selection techniques; Software defect prediction; Software developer; Software design",,,,,,"Adak, M.F., Software defect detection by using data mining based fuzzy logic (2018) 2018 Sixth Int.

The driving behavior influences by demographic aspects, fatigue, work condition, and others. To correct a behavior tendency, it is important to enhance the understanding of the influence of the demographic aspect to some factors related to the behavior tendency. This study was intended to measure the effect of age, driving experience, and time on task per trip to the workload (WL), fatigue (F), recovery needs (KP), and emotional intelligent (EI) as factors that influence driving behavior (DD). A set of questions as a research instrument was composed based on various literature. The instrument distributed to inter-city bus drivers from several bus companies. A total of 201 responds to questionnaires were obtained, but only 167 data processed further. The reliability of this instrument is quite good as indicated by the alpha Cronbach of 0.733 and the significant internal consistency result. The Kruskal Wallis test result showed that there were no differences among the above variables based on age groups (<35 y, 35-45 y, and> 45y). However, emotional intelligence differed between driving experience groups (<5 y, 5-10 y,> 10 y) and between time on task per trip (<3 hr, 3-5 hr,> 5 hr). The fatigue level also expressed differently of times on task per trip. Based on the result, it suggested to include emotional intelligence assessment in a corrected tendency behavior. The result also emphasized on time on task as a primary factor in fatigue mitigation to minimize risk accident. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","bus drivers; driving behavior; emotional intelligence; fatigue; workload","Accidents; Bus drivers; Buses; Fatigue of materials; Population statistics; Surveys; Behavior tendencies; Driving behavior; Driving experiences; Fatigue mitigation; Internal consistency; Kruskal-Wallis tests; Research instruments; workload; Emotional intelligence",,,,"Binus University","This study is supported by Indonesia Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education as part of PenelitianUnggulanPerguruanTinggi Research Grant to Binus University with contract number :","Da Silva, F.P., Santos, J., Meireles, A., Road Accident: Driver Behavior, Learning and Driving Task (2004) Procedia Soc.

In vitro shoots were irradiated with several gamma-ray doses. Rodent tuber plantlets were irradiated with the doses of 20 Gy. The plantlets were subcultured up to 5 times then produced MV1 to MV5. Plantlets MV4 and MV5 were acclimatized and transplanted at the greenhouse. The purpose of this study was to analyze the morphological characteristics in the fourth mutant vegetative propagation (MV4) and the fifth mutant vegetative propagation (MV5) of rodent tuber from the combination of gamma-ray irradiation and somaclonal variation. Subcultures were performed to regenerate from MV1 to MV5 with optimal MS (Murashige & Skoog) medium. Subcultures were done at eight weeks. The morphological measurement in MV4 with the average number of shoots, number of leaves and plant height, i.e. 5.21, 14.41 and 5.52 cm, respectively. The highest average number of shoots, number of leaves and plant height was generated in MV5, i.e. 5.23, 16.54 and 5.18 cm, respectively. Pre-acclimatization were successfully produced in the greenhouse of about 30% (MV4) and 39.5% (MV5). Post acclimatization was obtained 100% in control, MV4, and MV5 at the greenhouse. MV5 had better morphological characteristics.

The rodent tuber mutant plant extract and DMSO were formulated into nanoemulsion with a fixed concentration of 0.1% of the weight of the formula, the emulsifier was used tween 80 with a concentration of 0.1% and glycerol with a concentration of 0%, 2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, 10% of the weight of the formula while the solvent used is distilled water with a final volume 10 mL of the weight of the formula. This study aimed to determine the physical and chemical characteristics of nanoemulsion prepared at various concentrations and volume ratios of rodent tuber mutant plant extract and surfactant. The analysis of the component of the nanoemulsions was conducted using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The alkane group found in the nanoemulsion sample, such as eicosane (5.96%). It can be concluded that the best extract and surfactant concentrations are using glycerol at 0%. The droplet sizes of 0% glycerol concentration had 111.6 nm and a polydispersity index of 0.541 compared with other concentrations. Nanoemulsion at 0% of glycerol showed a low zeta potential value of -19.36 mV. The destabilization of nanoemulsion after 24 h was dominated with creaming appeared, as shown in negative zeta potential. This shows that the formulation is not stable enough for a certain period of time even though it has a nanoparticle size. The development of nanoemulsion optimalization is a prospective approach to solve the stabilization problem. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Biotechnology; Emulsification; Extraction; Gamma rays; Gas chromatography; Glycerol; Mass spectrometry; Paraffins; Surface active agents; Tubes (components); Zeta potential; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometries (GC-MS); Glycerol concentration; Negative zeta potentials; Physical and chemical analysis; Physical and chemical characteristics; Polydispersity indices; Stabilization problems; Surfactant concentrations; Plant extracts",,,,,,"Ahmad, N., Ramsch, R., Linàs, M., Solans, C., Hashim, R., Tajuddin, H.A., (2014) Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces, 115, pp. 267-274; Ali, H., Dixit, S., Ali, D., Alqahtani, S.M., Alkahtani, S., Alarifi, S., (2015) Drug Design, Development & Therapy, 9, pp. 2793-2800; Ashraf, A., Sarfraz, R.A., Rashid, M.A., Mahmood, A., Shahid, M., Noor, N., (2014) Pharmaceutical Biology, 54 (10), pp. 1971-1981; Chiewchan, N.C., Phungamngeoen, Sriwattana, Y., (2006) J.

However, in the transportation sector, safety is still a serious problem and requires attention. Road accidents in Indonesia with a high fatality mostly involve intercity buses. Most of the accidents are reportedly caused by human error, typically caused by a fatigued driver. To understand the factors that influence general fatigue (F), three variables-subjective workload (WL), need for recovery (NR), and emotional intelligence (EI)-are discussed by considering time on task and time of day as factors. To assess the perceptions of 298 intercity bus drivers, this research was conducted using a questionnaire. There are statistically significant differences in the NR (p = 0.001) and EI level (p = 0.001) among the time on task group (less than three hours, three to five hours, and longer than five hours) but not for the WL. Meanwhile, for the time of day group (driving in the morning, afternoon, and at night) there are no significant differences of WL (p = 0.161), NR (p = 0.795), and EI level (p = 0.271). A Tukey post hoc test revealed that the NR and is statistically significantly higher for a duration longer than three hours (p = 0.025 and p = 0.000). Binomial logistic regression was run to understand the influence of WL, NR, and EI on subjective fatigue level, categorized into fatigue (1) and alert (0). The Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed that the model fit the data well, p = 0.673. The variables NR (p = 0.08) and EI (p = 0.020) statistically significantly predict general fatigue subjectively. Based on these results, EI and NR are suggested as factors that should be analyzed further concerning the issue of fatigue-related accidents. Both factors should also be considered in company's fatigue management system. © 2020 Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia.","Emotional intelligence; Fatigue; Intercity bus drivers; Need for recovery; Workload",,,,,"Binus University: 12/AKM/PNT/2019, 225/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019, 039/VR","This study is supported by the Indonesia Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education as part of the Penelitian Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University with contract number: 225/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019; 12/AKM/PNT/2019;039/VR.RTT/IV/2019 dated 27 March 2019.","Agresti, A., (2002) Categorical Data, , New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons; Bartlett, J.E., Kotrlik, J.Y., Higgins, C.C., Organizational Research: Determining Appropriate Sample Size in Survey Research (2001) Information Technology, Learning, and Performance Journal, 19 (1), pp. 43-50; Chen, C., Zhang, J., Exploring Background Risk Factors for Fatigue Crashes Involving Truck Drivers on Regional Roadway Networks: A Case Control Study in Jiangxi and Shaanxi, China (2016) Springer Plus, 5 (582), pp. 1-12; Craig, A., Tran, Y., Wijesuriya, N., Nguyen, H., Regional Brain Wave Activity Changes Associated with Fatigue (2012) Psychophysiology, 49 (4), pp. 547-582; da Costa, D.G., Malkhamah, S., Suparma, L.B., Use of the Safety Factor and Margin of Safety in Motorcyclist Accident Risk Management (2018) International Journal of Technology, 9 (4), pp. 737-750; Dawson, D., Reynolds, A.C., van Dongen, H.P., Thomas, M.J., Determining the Likelihood that Fatigue was Present in a Road Accident: A Theoretical Review and Suggested Accident Taxonomy (2018) Sleep Medicine Reviews, 42, pp. 202-210; de Vries, J., Michielsen, H.J., van Heck, G.L., Assessment of Fatigue among Working People: A Comparison of Six Questionnaires (2003) Occupational Environment Medicine, 60, pp. 10-15; Di Milia, L., Smolensky, M., Costa, G., Howarth, H., Ohayon, M., Philip, P., Demographic Factors, Fatigue, and Driving Accidents: An Examination of the Published Literature (2011) Accident Analysis and Prevention, 43 (2), pp. 516-532; Ferguson, S.A., Paech, G., Sargent, C., Darwent, D., Kennaway, D., Roach, G., The Influence of Circadian Time and Sleep Dose on Subjective Fatigue Ratings (2012) Accident Analysis and Prevention, 45S, pp. 50-54; Friswell, R., Williamson, A., Comparison of the Fatigue Experiences of Short Haul Night and Long Distance Heavy Vehicle Drivers (2013) Safety Science, 57, pp. 203-213; Gastaldi, M., Rossi, R., Gecchele, G., Effects of Driver Task-related Fatigue on Driving Performance (2011) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 111, pp. 955-964; Gilar-Corb, R., Pozo-Rico, T., Sánchez, B., Castejón, J.-L., Can Emotional Intelligence be improved?.

They reveal that Indonesia's ""Digital Islands"" are the largest internet user-base in the Southeast Asian region (150 million internet users in 2018), generate the largest internet economy ($27 billion in the year 2018) and operate the fastest-growing internet economy in Southeast Asia. However, the use of E-commerce itself in the sector of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia is still only between 9-15 %. The objective of this review is to establish a theoretical model that links digital business adoption, organizational innovation, frugal innovation type, and firm performance. A systematic literature review (SLR) is the method used for the critical review. The critical result of the review is used as the basis for the development of the concept. More than 864,000 publications released between 2014 and 2019 were screened using the keywords: digital business adoption, e-business adoption, e-commerce adoption, type of innovation, frugal innovation, organisational innovation, and firm performance. Eventually, for this study, 23 journals were included. Based on the analysis, the conceptual model has four possible connections: (1) The positive relationship between digital business adoption and SME achievements; (2) the good relationship between the adoption of digital businesses and organisational innovation; (3) the positive direct impacts of organizational innovations on company performance; and (4) a positive relationship exists between digital business adoption and frugal innovation type and organizational innovation. This study contributes a conceptual framework that digital business adoption, frugal innovation type, and organisational innovation might have important roles in the performance of SMEs. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Digitl business; Organisational performance; SMEs",,,,,,,"Abebe, M., Electronic Commerce Adoption, Entrepreneurial Orientation And Small-And Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME) performance (2014) Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, 21 (1), pp. 100-116. , https://doi.org/10.1108/JSBED-10-2013-0145; (2019) Pasar IdEA 2019 Hadir Untuk Pertama Kalinya Di Indonesia, , https://www.idea.or.id/berita/detail/pasar-idea-2019-hadir-untuk-pertama-kalinya-di-indonesia; Ballot, G., Fakhfakh, F., Galia, F., Salter, A., The fateful triangle: Complementarities in performance between product, process and organizational innovation in France and the UK ?

Improvement of motivation and enjoyment could be influenced by player personality. As there is a variety of personalities, gamification application developers should consider including various gameplay to adapt with each personality type. There is a need for adaptive gamification framework. This paper intends to propose an adaptive gamification framework with proper player classification and effectiveness evaluation method. This paper focuses on introducing gamification framework by combining adaptive gameplay, dynamic difficulty adjustment, Big Five personality model, player performance, and evaluation method to measure player motivation and enjoyment to see the effectiveness of gamification applications such as IMMS and eGameFlow.

Speech as input to Google is known as the Ok Google feature. However, many search engine users never pay attention to search engine definitions. So, websites are only limited to projects without further management, and that is what happens to the current website. Therefore, in this study, an assessment of usability is conducted on Google especially in the Ok Google feature using Nielsen Model. The research method used in this research is the quantitative research approach, a method which includes approach and kind of research, population and sample, instrument, data collection technique, and data analyze. Data collection techniques include learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors and satisfaction assessment and Likert scale ranges from 1 to 4. It can be signed into categories of sites with usability values, namely “very difficult to understand,” “difficult to understand”, “easy to understand” and “very easy to understand”. The construct validity is with Orthogonal Iterations with Index reliability of 0.91. The results of this study are the usability testing of Ok Google tends to be significance (α) of 5% with data of 124 is 1.66, feedback statement in the questionnaire is considered valid, then the questionnaire results show α = 0.91 which means the measurement of usability on Ok Google Feature is an excellent level. The average usability value obtained by Ok Google in Indonesia is included in the category of usability “easy to understand”. In addition, it was found that Ok Google has the highest memorability level and the lowest error. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Speech recognition; Usability; Website",,,,,,,"Qustoniah, A., Perancangan Sistem Pengenalan Pola Suara Menggunakan Metode Piecewise Dynamic Time Warping (2012) Widya Tek, 20 (1), pp. 11-17; Ronando, E., Irawan, M.I., Pengenalan Ucapan Kata Sebagai Pengendali Metode Linear Predictive Coding—Neuro Fuzzy (2012) J.

So far, Indonesia's maritime economic potential has not been optimally developed, especially in Natuna. The area of Natuna Sea is 99.25%, so it is very potential to develop marine tourism. Natuna is also included in the planning of the Global Maritime Fulcrum and is given the authority to manage tourism. Natuna Geopark has also been inaugurated by UNESCO in 2019. The presence of a geopark in Natuna will have an impact on the movement of foreign tourists. Thus, it is necessary to prepare human resources for tour guides to welcome foreign tourists. This study describes the design of Natuna Tourism application with an emphasis on mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) to introduce Natuna tourism in Indonesian, English and Mandarin. Through this application, students can learn independently. This application also features pictures and sounds with a quiz that helps learners to memorize vocabulary. Before designing this application, researchers first conducted interviews with the Natuna tourism service and religious high schools. From the interviews, the application was designed using the Mnemonic method. Researchers hope that with applications on smartphones that can be used offline, the Natuna tourism agency will develop and can contribute to improving the maritime economyfishermen, fish processing technology and illegal fishing. Whereas the obstacle in the field of goods distribution is the Sea Toll Program which is of little help due to the trip schedules of ships which are only twice a month. The fishermen's catch has become no longer fresh and cannot be sold at high prices. There should be special treatment for Natuna by developing a model of economic integration of Maritime and tourism. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

To allocate land use properly, the zoning method has been widely used, especially in densely populated cities, namely a kind of sustainable urban form with considers the mix of use/diversity of land use to minimize travel distance. This study proposes a method for calculating how much a city meets the sustainable urban forms based on compact city criteria, i.e. compatibility, dependency, and compactness. After the survey filling in compatibility and dependency scores for each land use, and compactness was calculated for each sub-district. Fuzzy C-Means clustering was used to cluster the result to classify other areas. In addition, this method can be used by planners to check whether their plans meet the concept of sustainable development or not. © 2019 IEEE.","city plan; compactness; compatibility; dependency; sustainable urban form","Land use; Sustainable development; City planners; Compact city; Filling in; Fuzzy C means clustering; Self-learning; Travel distance; Urban sustainability; Zoning method; Planning",,,,,,"Curwell, S., Deakin, M., Symes, M., (2005) Sustainable Urban Development, 1. , United Kingdom Routledge; Steiner, F., (2008) The Living Landscape-An Ecological Approach to Landscape Planning-Second Edition, , Washington DC ISLAND PRESS; Handayanto, R., Tripathi, N.K., Kim, S.M., Herlawati, H., Land use growth simulation and optimization for achieving a sustainable urban form (2018) TELKOMNIKA Telecommunication Comput.

This paper describes the process to predict the oscillation condition in power system as an alarm to the operator before the oscillation could cause power system outage. Using PMU, the phasor sifting data of power system could be observed and treated to achieve the quantitative measures. To process the phasor measurement data, Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is utilized to extract specific parameters such as instantaneous power of individual correspondent frequency. These parameters are fed to an artificial neural network (ANN) to distinguish between a stable and an oscillating condition. The ANN is trained with simulated data that represents the stable and oscillating conditions which might be taking place in power system. To increase the prediction precision, the majority vote algorithm is used for all results from the ANN. The speed of the prediction process is compared with the time of an actual event which causes an outage in the power system, in order to determine the effectiveness of the process model. These suggest that the model might be used, since the computation time of prediction model is faster than the time of the power system outage. © 2019 ICIC International.

LC-MS consists of Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometer analytical instruments. This device extensively used in Metabolomics, because it provides more comprehensive information about the metabolites. It also shows the breadth of the diversity of chemical compounds in metabolites that make difficult and time-consuming to identification of metabolite's structures. This is an obstacle in efficient and accurate identification. So, many open source softwares developed to simplify and speed up the analysis and interpretation of LC-MS result. There are popular open source softwares. We compiling mini review of this open source softwares. The conclusion is open source softwares quite helpful in terms of data analysis and interpretation of compounds contained, but no one has provided a single interpretation, still need experts for reliable interpretation. © 2019 IEEE.","Chromatography; Frequently Used Software; LC-MS; LC-MS Software; Preprocessing data LC-MS","Biomolecules; Chromatography; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometers; Metabolites; Open systems; Analytical instrument; Comprehensive information; LC-MS; Lc-ms analysis; Metabolomics; Preprocessing data LC-MS; Speed up; Open source software",,,,,,"Bla enovic, I., Kind, T., Ji, J., Fiehn, O., Software tools and approaches for compound identification of lc-ms/ms data in metabolomics (2018) Metabolites, 8 (2); Beirnaert, C., Using Expert Driven Machine Learning to Enhance Dynamic Metabolomics Data Analysis (2019) Metabolites, 9 (3), p. 54; Lamichhane, S., Sen, P., Dickens, A.M., Hyötyläinen, T., Ore ic, M., An Overview of Metabolomics Data Analysis: Current Tools and Future Perspectives (2018) Compr.

The model that will be evaluated is software complexity prediction model based on requirement. This model allows measuring software complexity before actual design and implementation. The experiment used three datasets namely training dataset, validation data set, and test dataset. For performance evaluation using Mean squared error. Mean squared error is very good at giving a description of how consistent the model is built. By minimizing the value of mean squared error, it means minimizing model variants. Models that have small variants are able to give relatively more consistent results for all input data compared to models with large variants. This research proposes the application of the Bayesian regularization algorithm for evaluating the performance of software complexity prediction model based on requirement. With this research it is expected to know how much the performance of the model that has been built. © BEIESP.","Algorithm; Complexity; Prediction; Software",,,,,,,"Liu, X., (1999) Object-Oriented Software Metrics; Na, K., Simpson, J.T., Li, X., Singh, T., Kim, K., (2007) Software Development Risk and Project Performance Measurement: Evidence in Korea, 80, pp. 596-605; Boehm, B., Abts, C., Brown, A., (2000) Cost Estimation with COCOMO II; Keshavarz, G., Modiri, N., Pedram, M., Metric for Early Measurement of Software Complexity (2011) Interfaces (Providence); Arthi, B., Selvarani, A.G., Sathya, A., (2016) Software Complexity Measure from Software Requirements Document and Cost Driver Factors, 24, pp. 6-12; Jakhar, A., Rajnish, K., Measurement Of Complexity And Comprehension Of A Program Through A Cognitive Approach (2015) Int.

The spelling check method aims to verify and correct misspelled words through a series of suggested words that are closer to the wrong word. Currently, Spell checkers for English language are well established. This article analyses several studies conducted in various types of languages other than English. Like Africa, Arabia, China, Indonesia, India, Japan, Malaysia and Thailand. We use the systematic literature Review approach to paper published 2008 - 2018. there are 23 papers to represent each language and view methods used. The result show that each language has a different Spelling Check Method. The Damerau-Levenshtein algorithm method is most often used for spelling checkers. © 2019 IEEE.","algorithm method; spelling checker; systematic literature review","Algorithm methods; Document quality; English languages; Indonesia; Spell-checking; Spelling checker; Spelling checks; Systematic literature review; Information management",,,,,,"Knierim, P., Schwind, V., Feit, A.M., Nieuwenhuizen, F., Henze, N., Physical keyboards in virtual reality: Analysis of typing performance and effects of avatar hands (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Confer-ence on Human Factors in Computing Systems-CHI '18; Fleischer, A.B., Increasing incidence within PubMed of the use of the misspelling pruritis (sic) instead of pruritus for itch (2016) Acta Dermato-Venereologica, 96 (6), pp. 826-827; Furugori, T., Improving spelling checkers for Japanese users of english (1990) IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, 33 (3), pp. 138-142; Wint, Z.Z., Ducros, T., Aritsugi, M., Spell corrector to social media datasets in message filtering systems (2018) 2017 12th International Conference on Digital Information Management, ICDIM 2017, 2018, pp. 209-215. , Janua Icdim; Octaviano, M., Borra, A., A spell checker for a low-resourced and morphologically rich language (2017) IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON, 2017, pp. 1853-1856. , Decem; Low, S.W., Investment performance analysis of managerial expertise: Evidence from Malaysian-based international equity unit trust funds (2013) Jurnal Pengurusan, 38, pp. 41-51. , July 2014; Grobbelaar L, A., Kinyua, J.D.M., A spell checker and corrector for the native South African language, South Sotho (2009) Proceedings of the 2009 Annual Conference of the Southern African Computer Lecturers' Association On-SACLA '09, pp. 50-59. , http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1562741.1562747; Naroua, H., Salifou, L., On the computerization of african languages (2016) American Journal of Applied Sciences, 13 (11), pp. 1228-1234; Madi, N., Al-Khalifa, H.S., A proposed Arabic grammatical error detection tool based on deep learning (2018) Procedia Computer Science, 142, pp. 352-355; Al-Jefri, M.M., Mahmoud, S.A., Context-sensitive Arabic spell checker using context words and n-gram language models (2015) Proceedings-2013 Taibah University International Conference on Advances in Information Technology for the Holy Quran and Its Sciences, NOORIC 2013, pp. 258-263; Mohammed, N., Abdellah, Y., The vocabulary and the morphology in spell checker (2018) Procedia Computer Science, 127, pp. 76-81; Dhanju, K.S., Lehal, G.S., Saini, T.S., Kaur, A., Design and implementation of shahmukhi spell checker (2015) Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 8 (27); Setiadi, I., Damerau-levenshtein algorithm and bayes theorem for spell checker optimization (2013) Sekolah Teknik Elektro Dan Informatika Institut Teknologi Bandung, , December; Chiu, H.-W., Wu, J.-C., Chang, J.S., (2013) Chinese Spelling Checker Based on Statistical Machine Translation, pp. 49-53. , October; Yeh, W.-Y., Chen, J.-F., Su, M.-C., Chinese spelling checker based on an inverted index list with a rescoring mechanism spelling checker based on an inverted index list with a rescoring mechanism (2015) ACM Trans.

This study aims to get the level of emotion towards the Asian Para Games event in Indonesia.This research begins by collecting data contained on Twitter using language filters and hashtags. Each data taken will be preprocessing, where the process was done by removing punctuation, hash tags and conversion of several emojis to text. By using the polyglotlibrary, determining an emotion from each term can be done more easily because the library can recognize various languages, including Indonesian. This experiment achieves55.41% accuracy. With so many non-standard word, abbreviation and unknown emojis,this research can still be developed by making several word changes into standard words,as well as converting all emojis or emoticons to the appropriate expression. © 2019, ICIC International.

Ovarium cancer consists of benign and malignant type. Based on the data set obtained, this research try to classify the data set with support vector machine algorithm. The principle of SVM is how to identify a hyperplanes with maximal margin. Hyperplanes is a border line between the data. Here, we will used two kernel function in SVM, linear and polynomial kernel function. Next We will compare both of them algorithm to reach the hyperplanes with maximal margin. The hyperplanes then used to predict the class of data testing given. Finally, comparation result will be obtained from confussion matrix and accuration calculation for each kernel function while used to classify the ovarium cancer data set. Accuration result with Linear kernel function is 68.98% for first schema and 66.67% for second schema. Then accuration result with Polynomial Kernel Function is 83.79% for both of schema. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Diseases; Geometry; Polynomials; Support vector machines; Cancer classification; Cancer disease; Data testing; Kernel function; Linear kernel functions; Maximal margin; Polynomial kernels; Support vector machine algorithm; Classification (of information)",,,,,,"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarium-cancer, access at january 2017; Usman, K., Kaship, R., Brain Tumor Classification from Multi Modality MRI UsingWavelets and Machine Learning (2017) Pattern Analytics Application, 20 (3), p. 871; Samosir, R.S., Filtering and Wavelet Transform Algorithm for Old Document Image Restoration (2017) Computer, Mathematics and Engineering Application, 8 (3), pp. 177-181; Megha, P.A., Ram Mohana Reddy, G., An intelligent Content-Based Image Retrieval system for Clinical Decision Support in Brain Tumor Diagnosis (2013) International Journal Multimed Information Retrieval, 2 (3), pp. 175-188; Taranjit, K., Barjinder, S.S., Savita, G., A Novel Feature Selection Method for Brain Tumor MR Image Classification Based onThe Fisher Criterion and Parameter-Free Bat Optimization (2018) Neural Computing & Application, 29 (8), pp. 193-206; Chaddad, A., Automated Feature Extraction in Brain Tumor by Magnetic Resonance Image Using Gaussian Mixture Models (2015) J.

It is also what programmers spend much time on. Therefore, many tools to ease the user interface development are available. Many of them are part of integrated development environment (IDE) of programming languages. Some of them are more generic and available for a few user interface toolkits or programming languages. However, these tools usually assume their users are targeting specific platform: desktop, web, or mobile application. While generic tools are sometimes generous enough, they usually cannot make it totally independent of underlying toolkit or programming languages. Modeling tools exist, but it means learning something new. This is one of the backgrounds for what we propose in this paper. An application user interface model based on spreadsheet: software packages that have been around for almost four decades. We emphasize multiplatform output: design once and output in several platforms (we provide two: desktop and web; adaptable to more). We do not assume a specific toolkit or programming language, but we still care about styles. Our experiments prove this method is usable and results in quicker user interface prototyping—even for professional programmers—with development time comparison ranging from 26.7% (best) to 80%. © BEIESP.","Code generation; Programming language; Spreadsheet; User interface; User interface modeling",,,,,,"Dr. Ford Lumban Gaol is currently Associate Professor Informatics Engineering and Information System, Bina Nusantara University.

Our result illustrates that the support vector machine has a 0.92 (92%) accuracy value and a 0.927 (92.7%) precision value. The support vector machine has the highest result, when compared with other classification algorithms. Our novel method uses a static analysis to extract the function call based sensitive function list correctly and not just as a keyword. The source codes that read as a bag of words or read with neuro linguistic programming are prone to a false positive detection. This is because the source code language has different structures compared with the regular language. The source code uses a static analysis to extract its abstract syntax tree structures. © ICIC International 2019.","Classification; Function call; Static analysis; Web shell backdoor",,,,,,,"Christianini, N., Shawe-Taylor, J., (2000) An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-Based Learning Methods, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Hagen, B., Behrens, S., (2013) Web Shell Detection Using Neopi; Canali, D., Balzarotti, D., Francillon, A., The role of web hosting providers in detecting compromised websites (2013) Proc. of the 22Nd International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 177-188; Chess, B., West, J., (2007) Secure Programming with Static Analysis, Pearson Education; Cooper, K., Torczon, L., (2011) Engineering a Compiler, , Elsevier; (2011) Php Shell Detector: Web Shell Detection Tool; (2013) R-Fx Network, Linux Malware Detect; Grune, D., van Reeuwijk, K., Bal, H.E., Jacobs, C.J.H., Langendoen, K., (2012) Modern Compiler Design, , Springer Science & Business Media; Hagan, M.T., Demuth, H.B., Beale, M.H., (1996) Neural Network Design, , Pws Pub., Boston; Kim, J., Yoo, D.-H., Jang, H., Jeong, K., Webshark 1.0: A benchmark collection for malicious web shell detection (2015) Journal of Information Processing Systems, 11 (2), pp. 229-238; Xu, M., Chen, X., Hu, Y., Design of software to search ASP web shell (2012) Procedia Engineering, 29, pp. 123-127; (2018) Web Server Survey, 2018. , January; Rish, I., An empirical study of the naive Bayes classifier (2001) IJCAI 2001 Workshop on Empirical Methods in Artificial Intelligence, 3, pp. 41-46; Safavian, S.R., Landgrebe, D., A survey of decision tree classifier methodology (1991) IEEE Trans.

However, the research on the phenomenon of applying social media marketing to museums has been investigated by international researchers, but has never been done by researchers in Indonesia. This study has a focus on testing whether the Museum Facebook Fan Page User Experience is a mediator or moderator variable between user motivations and user expectations of intention to use Facebook Museum Fan page and whether the online community involvement moderates the relation between the Facebook Fan Page usage intention to the visit museum intention. The research design is the quantitative approach. Data was collected using a questionnaire distributed to followers of the museum Facebook Fan Page in Indonesia. The researchers was randomly select the museum Facebook Fan Page and online cultural community Facebook groups in Indonesia. The sample size was 270 respondents. The data analysis is the Structural Equation Modeling analysis method using AMOS Ver. 22. In this study, eight hypotheses are accepted and one hypothesis is rejected. The r2 of the Facebook Fan Page usage intention is 0.446, it means that the variable can be explained by user expectations, user motivations, and Facebook Fan Page User Experience. The r2 of the visit museum intention is 0.350, it means that the variable can be explained by the Facebook Fan Page User Experience and online community involvement. The contribution of this research is to contribute the Facebook Adoption model that accommodates the Facebook Fan Page usage experience and the online community involvement for marketing and cultural education in the Museum industry in Indonesia. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Facebook Fan Page User Experience; Online Community Involvement; The Facebook Fan Page Usage Intention; The Visit Museum Intention; User Expectations; User Motivations",,,,,,,"(2016) Slideshare: Global Digital Statistics for 2016, , http://www.digitalbuzzblog.com/slideshareglobal-digital-statistics-report-for-2016, [Accessed: 07-Jun-2016]; Utama, I.G.B.R., Mengelola Warisan Budaya Sebagai Produk Pariwisata (2015) Researchgate, , http://www.yayasankertagama.org/article/article3.pdf, [Accessed: 13-Mar-2017]; UNESCO, (2008) Towards Sustainable Strategies for Creative Tourism; (2017) Tentang Pemajuan Kebudayaan. 2017; Wulandari, A.A.A., Fajarwati, A.A.S., Latif, F., The Relationship of Exhibition Space Design and the Success of Delivering Messages to Museum Visitors in Jakarta (2017) Humaniora, 8 (3), p. 219. , Oct; Sulistiyana, R.T., Hamid, D., Azizah, D.F., Pengaruh Fasilitas Wisata dan Harga Terhadap Kepuasan Konsumen (Studi pada Museum Satwa) (2015) J.

Using data of phasor sifting in power system available through Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) implementation, power system oscillations could be observed directly. However, to predict the condition of power system, the recorded phasor data need to be processed to obtain the quantitative measures. In this paper, important parameters are extracted by applying Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) to phasor signal taken from PMU. The stable and oscillation condition are determined by the parameters that show the increasing power of each frequency over period of time. Validation is conducted by using simulation data that represents characteristic of PMU data. © 2019 Buyung Sofiarto Munir et al.","Hilbert-Huang Transform; Instantaneous power; Phasor measurement unit; Power system oscillation; Stable signal",,,,,,,"Phadke, A.G., Synchronized phasor measurements in power systems (1993) IEEE Computer Applications in Power, 6 (2), pp. 10-15; Deb, G., Chakraborty, K., Gauss-Seidel Method based Voltage Security Analysis of Distribution System (2018) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE), 8 (1), pp. 43-51; Zhang, Q., Vittal, V., Heydt, G.T., Logic, N., Sturgill, S., The integrated calibration of synchronized phasor measurement data in power transmission systems (2011) IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, 26 (4), pp. 2573-2581; Munir, B.S., Trisetyarso, A., Field Data Accuracy Analysis of Phasor Measurement Unit Application (2016) In 2016 8th International Conference on Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ICITEE), pp. 8-11. , Yogyakarta, Indonesia; Zhou, M., Centeno, V., Thorp, J.S., Phadke, A.G., Calibrating instrument transformers with phasor measurements (2012) Electric Power Components and Systems, 40 (14), pp. 1605-1620; Patel, V.S., Bhil, S.K., Kazi, F.S., Wagh, S.R., Energy-sorted Prony analysis for identification of dominant low frequency oscillations.

With gamification, a lot of people help people learn something natural, and gamification is usually inspired by everyday life, for example, the game The Sims, which combines daily life with a game in sports is one of the best examples of gamification implementation. Using gamification in a game makes learning more enjoyable than learning with truth, and without realizing it they have done learning. In this paper we proposed a gamification architecture for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) which include logic game such as brain, think, body, move, sport and logic. Moreover, there are five methods proposed for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) such as object game, content, and player, design, and framework, deploy and play, and finish structure. © 2018 IEEE.","ADHD games;

The popularity of the game has raised the attention of many researchers from various research domains. But there are some problems in game design. One of these problems is a game adaptation that can be defined freely as the game's ability to adapt to various factors such as: gamer's skills, emotion playing, layer formats, and hardware platforms. The purpose of this paper is to propose a case-based reasoning (CBR)-based game architecture for designing adaptive text-based computer games that will be used as a delivery of high performance computing (HPC) learning. © 2018 IEEE.","Adaptive; case-based reasoning (CBR); Design; Game; High Performance Computing (HPC)","Case based reasoning; Design; Pattern recognition; Adaptive; Casebased reasonings (CBR); Game; Game architecture; Hardware platform; High performance computing; High performance computing (HPC); Research domains; Computer games",,,,,,"Prasad, S.K., Chtchelkanova, A., Dehne, F., Gouda, M., Gupta, A., Jaja, J., Kant, K., Wu, J., (2012) NSF/IEEE-TCPP Curriculum Initiative on Parallel and Distributed Computing-Core Topics for Undergraduates, 55p. , www.cs.gsu.edu/-tcpp/curriculum/index.php, Version I,.

This comparison aims to find the most appropriate similarity coefficient for some cases. Many results found that Sorensen-dice coefficient and Jaccard coefficient is close or even identical. But Jaccard coefficient can not handle properly for sets with real-value or weighted sets or any pair of vectors. So, Jaccard coefficient redefined as Generalized Jaccard Coefficient. This paper shows the correlation between Sorensen-dice coefficient with Generalized Jaccard Coefficient using Spearman's correlation as predecessors research did and using ANOVA to ensure the results. This research find that the comparison between them is less similar from predecessors research. © 2018 IEEE.","comparison; Generalized Jaccard Similarity; rodent tuber; similarity coefficient; Sorensen-Dice Similarity","Software engineering; comparison; Generalized Jaccard Similarity; rodent tuber; Similarity coefficients; Sorensen-Dice Similarity; Pattern recognition",,,,,,"Sianipar, N.F., Ariandana, Maarisit, W., Detection of gamma-irradiated mutant of rodent tuber (typhonium flagelliforme lodd) (2015) Vitro Culture by RAPD Molecular Marker, 14, pp. 285-294; Laurent, D., Sianipar, N.F., Chelen, L., Wantho, A., Analysis of genetic diversity of Indonesia rodent tuber (typhonium flagelliforme lodd.)

Depending on the experiences and languages, developing a web application could be a simple or complex task. It is complex because the programmer should use more than one languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, language at the server side, and others). To reduce the number of languages, programmers may use domain-specific languages. The more specific the language, the simpler the development could be. However, some researches show that language specificity itself could be another challenge. Therefore, to make web application development simpler and at the same time make the domain-specific language useful, more research is needed. We propose the usage of spreadsheet – software packages that have been around for about four decades. We emphasize simple modeling technique, combined with column/row based syntax, saved as comma-separated values (CSV) file format, which can be interpreted as a fully functional web application. Experiments prove this method is usable and results in simpler web application development with significantly less development time (43%) and lines of code (30%) compared with standard web technologies.

They provide warning signs and also give feedback to help the government take required measures to improve its performance. In the public sector, it is difficult to measure the output as services provided do not have a price which would indicate their value to the community. Outputs, such as education services, are provided free or at a subsidized price. One of the public sectors in Indonesia which is very important to be measured for its productivity is public schooling. This study is one of the first efforts in looking at the feasibility of constructing productivity measures for Indonesian public schools. The method and model used in measuring Public School productivity is modified. Data used are secondary data available from several government sources. The study has been positive and has produced some interesting and meaningful results. Public school productivity in Indonesia has improved overall since 2011 and the improvement is getting better still, since 2014. But these improvements are not enough and are still lagging behind several ASEAN countries. The policies and programs need to be analyzed and evaluated in such a way that there is improvement in the overall education productivity and education quality. It is important that measures will be improved by involving stakeholders in the productivity measurement study. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Goods and services; Government policies; Inputs; Productivity measures outputs; Public sector outputs; Resources",,,,,,,"Andrews, D., Criscuolo, C., Gal, P.N., (2016) The Best Versus the Rest: The Global Productivity Slowdown, Divergence across Firms and the Role of Public Policy (OECD Productivity Working Papers, 2016-05), , Paris, France: OECD Publishing; Atkinson, A.B., The Atkinson review: Final report (2005) Measurement of Government Output and Productivity for the National Accounts, , Basingstoke, England: Palgrave Macmillan; (2017) Report on Government Services 2017, , https://bsllibrary.org.au/general/report-government-services-rogs-2017-productivity-commission-79753/, Canberra, Australia: AGPC.

However, to maintain credibility, trust from the public on service and learning capabilities as well as recognition extensively are needed. To measure capability in service and learning can be displayed by the technology used during all activities at the university. In this study, an analysis was conducted on the influence of ICT and Public Recognition on University Credibility by using Multiple Linear Regression test. The data used are questionnaire with 13 items representing three variables, namely Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Public Recognition, and University Credibility. Each instrument that is distributed and obtained was used to test the validity and reliability of the items. The results show that 61% of ICT and Public Recognition are proved to influence the credibility of the university.

New horizons emerged with the implementation of the BI concept using “Cloud Computing”. The leading IT companies compete to develop BI cloud-based services (cloud BI). This study aimed to determine the factors influencing manager decision to adopt cloud BI in Indonesia’s financial service sector, using the diffusion of innovation (DOI) model and technology organization environment (TOE) framework. The research also obtains prediction of the cloud BI marketing trend in Indonesia. The survey conducted with 30 participants at the senior management level in Indonesia’s financial services sector. The findings reveal, the adoption rate of cloud BI in Indonesia financial service sector still very low. Only 3.4% of firms have implemented cloud BI, while 10% not considering the cloud BI adoption. The results of this research can be used by vendors to develop cloud BI tools that fit into the customer’s need. It is also very useful for marketers to know the characteristics and demographics of cloud BI users. For regulators, this research illustrates how and what drives regulators to make policies that can encourage companies to use the latest technology. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cloud BI; Cloud business intelligence; DOI framework; TOE framework","Commerce; Database systems; Information analysis; Marketing; Surveys; Business intelligent; Cloud business; Diffusion of innovations; DOI framework; Financial services sector; Senior management; Technology-organization-environment frameworks; TOE framework; Finance",,,,,,"Olszak, C.M., Toward better understanding and use of business intelligence in organizations (2016) Inf.

Specifically review the effects of facilitation methods and teacher involvement in student participation in online discussion forums. In the trial attended by 94 teachers, 193 classes and 5104 students, to compare the level of student participation in the online discussion forums held in all study programs in the Faculty of Law, Faculty of Law, University of Pamulang The participation of the students as the dependent variable in the two methods facilitated the discussion, the discussion was facilitated by the students as an experimental class and the discussions were facilitated by the teachers as a kind of control. Teacher participation as a covariate. In general, the results show that the amount of student participation in student issues initiated by the students is superior to the discussion topics initiated by the teachers, once the level of teacher participation is adjusted. The discussion topic made by the students encourages students to participate more than the topic of discussion made by the teachers, because the students are more interested in the topics that interest them. This study has the effect of facilitating participation in online learning discussion forums at the level of student participation. The results also show that the freedom granted to students to make the topic of discussion is not influenced by the size or participation of the teacher. © 2019 The Authors.","E-learning; Effectiveness of learning; Facilitation methods","Information systems; Information use; Learning systems; Online systems; Social networking (online); Students; Dependent variables; Discussion forum; Effectiveness of learning; Electronic learning systems; Facilitation methods; Online discussion forums; Online learning; Student participation; E-learning",,,,,,"Jacobson, D., Chapman, R., Ye, C., Os, J.V., A project-based approach to executive education (2017) Journal of Innovative Educations; Allen, E., Seaman, J., (2009) Learning on Demand, , Babson; Ferre, C., Glynn, H., Wiest, Lynda, R., Effective online instruction in higher education (2012) Quarterly Review of Distance Education, 13 (1), pp. 11-14; Romero, C., Lopez, M.I., Luna, J.M., Ventura, S., (2013) Predicting Students Final Performance from Participation in On-Online Discussion Forum, , Elsevier; Wisneski, J.E., Ozogul, G., Bichelmeyer, B.A., (2015) Does Teaching Presence Transfer between MBA Teaching Environments?

The use of the flipped classroom has been running in this department for four semesters, where in one semester, each class gets a subject that is taught by a flipped classroom method. Questionnaires were distributed online among students from level one to three in October 2018 and 249 respondents were obtained. The data obtained were analyzed using descriptive statistics in order to study the perception of the students about the application of the flipped classroom, both in general and from the four aspects of the engagement: behavioral, emotional, cognitive and agentic engagement. The results obtained show that most of the respondents (61%) agreed with the use of flipped classroom because the class became more fun. In terms of engagement, behavioral engagement has the highest mean value of 3.12 while agent engagement has the lowest mean value of 2.42. It means that students have shown an attitude to follow the flipped classroom method but have not actively participated. The rest where students disagreed with flipped classroom is due to lecturers assumed unprepared and/or students have difficulty learning by themselves. © IAEME Publication.","Aspects; Engagement; Evaluation; Flipped Learning; Perception",,,,,,,"Chicca, J., Shellenbarger, T., Connecting with generation Z: Approaches in nursing education (2018) Teach.

In most university, management must be able to collect all hundreds of proposals and reports; not to mention they must be able to accommodate the process of reviewing every single proposal. They also need to monitor all research output in final report and make sure that all of the outputs are correctly achieved from proposed target. In addition to the problems stated, previous activities are done manually, leaving a lot of opportunity to improve and automate the process. All of the addressable opportunity for improvement are explained and explored, thus a model of the web application is created. This paper presents the design of web application used to solve persistent problem in research management, specifically in Binus University. The design methodology is divided into two phases: requirement engineering phase, and system design. Upon finishing the requirement engineering phase, system model is depicted using Unified Modeling Language, specifically: Activity Diagram, Use Case Diagram, and Conceptual Class Diagram. © 2018 IEEE.","higher education; research management system; unified modeling language","Information management; Systems analysis; Telecommunication services; Unified Modeling Language; Design Methodology; Design of web applications; Higher education; Requirement engineering; Research activities; Research management; Research management systems; Research outputs; Design",,,,,,"Braddock, R., Neave, G., Research management in higher education: Overview and conclusion of a debate (2002) Higher Education Policy, 15 (3), pp. 313-330; Shon, H.S., Han, S.H., Kim, K.A., Cha, E.J., Ryu, K.H., Proposal reviewer recommendation system based on big data for a national research management institute (2017) Journal of Information Science, 43 (2), pp. 147-158; Lu, R., (2016) University Teaching and Research and Scientific Research Performance Quantitative Statistics System; Morgan, A., Duffield, N., Walkley Hall, L., Research data management support: Sharing our experiences (2017) Journal of the Australian Library and Information Association, 66 (3), pp. 299-305; Liu, Y., Yao, Y., Zhang, X., Liu, B., Ding, C., Design of research management system based on workflow and rapid development platform technology (2015) Estimation, Detection and Information Fusion (ICEDIF), 2015 International Conference on, pp. 329-334. , IEEE, January; Morales, M.P.E., Abulon, E.L.R., Ermita, R.C., David, A.P., Organizing and systematizing knowledge management through an automated university-based research Portal (2017) Asia Pacific Journal of Multidisciplinary Research, 5, p. 3; Pressman, R.S., Software engineering-A practitioners approach (2015) Mc Graw-Hill International Edition, 2010; Matthias, R., Tools & Techniques Expert Opinion, Online, , http://www.idemployee.id.tue.nl/g.w.m.rauterberg/lecturenotes/UFTexp.ertopinion.pdf; Rumbaugh, J., Booch, G., Jacobson, I., (2017) The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual, , Addison Wesley; Dumas, M., Ter Hofstede, A.H., UML activity diagrams as a workflow specification language (2001) International Conference on the Unified Modeling Language, pp. 76-90. , Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, October; Jena, A.K., Swain, S.K., Mohapatra, D.P., A novel approach for test case generation from UML activity diagram (2014) Issues and Challenges in Intelligent Computing Techniques (ICICT), 2014 International Conference on, pp. 621-629. , IEEE, February; Ikram, M.T., Butt, N.A., Hussain, A., Nadeem, A., Testing from uml design using activity diagram: A comparison of techniques (2015) International Journal of Computer Applications, 131, p. 5; Seidl, M., Scholz, M., Huemer, C., Kappel, G., The use case diagram (2015) UML@ Classroom, pp. 23-47. , Springer, Cham",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2018","3 September 2018 through 5 September 2018",,142373,,9781538658215,,,"English","Proc.

The development of cross-border tourism is in line with Jokowi-Jusuf Kalla‘s nine priorities. However, the obstacle in tourism is human resources who fluently speak foreign languages in marketing and communicating with foreign tourists, especially in the border area. Since Natuna is far and difficult to reach, no Natuna‘s university educates their human resources to speak a foreign language and because Natuna is also lack of foreign teacher. Therefore, it needs a breakthrough in foreign language learning through mobile learning applications. As smartphones are commonly used in society, the solution of foreign language learning through smartphone application became an innovation in education and training. The research method was Focus Group Discussion (FGD) between officials of Natuna‘s Regional Planning, Research, and Development Agency. The FGD was done by showing the design of interactive mobile applications for foreign language learning, especially English and Mandarin. The design of this application has been demonstrated in the FGD activities and has received a positive response. The conclusion of this research is Mobile Learning application is a foreign language learning solution to support tourism activities in Natuna. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Cross-border tourism; M-learning application; Natuna","E-learning; Regional planning; Smartphones; Teaching; Cross-border; Foreign language learning; Human resources development; Innovation in educations; Interactive mobile applications; M-Learning; Natuna; Smart-phone applications; Computer aided instruction",,,,,,"Kabupaten, P.D., Kondisi Geografis Kabupaten Natuna, , https://natunakab.go.id/kondisi-geografis-kabupaten-natuna/, Natuna.

Jakarta is one of the big cities and is the capital of Indonesia. This study aims to provide solutions to congestion problems in the capital city by maximizing the intelligent transportation system, convenient and safe for passengers. This research finds the fact that people's need for Trans Jakarta is relatively high but in fact it is not directly proportional to the public interest towards the use of Trans Jakarta buses. This study finds issues related to the needs and expectations of the community using Trans Jakarta facilities. Not only convenience and security and cheap price offered but also the ease and speed in transacting. This research provides ideas related to the facilities provided by Trans Jakarta as one of public transportation owned by the government. Combining smart phones with the use of internet-based technology (IOT). This research proposed an integrated system (integration platform). The solution with IOT-based technology enhancements makes it easy to present all information about bus availability, bus scheduling, booking places and easy online payment. This study uses a comparative study related to the needs of passengers in using Trans Jakarta. This study found the need of passengers for the existence of an integrated system that presents all information and ease of public transportation access in the city of Jakarta. © 2018 IEEE.","integration platform; integration system; Internet of Thing; online payment","Buses; Developing countries; Electronic commerce; Integrated control; Intelligent systems; Smartphones; Traffic congestion; Integration platform; Integration systems; Intelligent transportation systems; Internet based technology; On-line payment; Public transportation; Public transportation systems; Technology enhancements; Internet of things",,,,,,"Nusraningrum, D., Isibhi, F., The influence of kiss and ride and park and ride in decreasing the private transportation by using the public transportation (2013) Transjakarta ' Nusraningrum & Isibhi, 3 (6), pp. 58-74; Gayah, V.V., Wood, J.S., (2016) Estimating Uncertainty of Bus Arrival Times and Passenger Occupancies Estimating Uncertainty of Bus Arrival Times and Passenger Occupancies; Nkurunziza, A., Zuidgeest, M., Brussel, M., Van Maarseveen, M., Modeling commuter preferences for the proposed bus rapid transit in dar-es-salaam (2012) J.

One of the benchmarks used is to measure the level of maturity of IT Governance. COBIT 5 becomes the main reference that is often used for these needs. But to do the assessment takes a long time because of the many processes assessed. This becomes an obstacle for a very dynamic company, the business has changed but the new assessment is completed. The authors propose a new approach using a priority model that adopts a enterprise strategy and incorporates it with a follow-up of previous IT Governance audit results. Tests have been conducted one of the state-owned enterprises in Indonesia engaged in the financial sector and has a dynamic business. The results showed that the assessment can effectively improve the quality of corporate IT objectives with the acceleration of the assessment process up to 20%. © 2018 IEEE.","COBIT 5; Effective assessment; Enterprise IT Goals; IT Governance; IT on State Own Company; Prioritisation Approach","COBIT 5; Effective assessment; Enterprise IT; IT governance; On state; Prioritisation Approach",,,,,,"Steuperaert, D., Improving the quality of the COBIT 5 goals cascade as an it process prioritisation mechanism (2016) International Journal of IT/Business Alignment and Governance, 7 (2), pp. 49-69; Pasquini, A., Galie, E., COBIT 5 and the process capability model.

With large population, TransJakarta is one choice for citizens of Jakarta because TransJakarta can accomodate many passenger at once. But the problem is sometime there is uncertainty number of passenger at each stop point or shuttle bus. This cause the number of vehicles is not match with the number of passenger. Finally there will be passenger accumulation, must time wasted and unpleasant condition where passenger push each other. TransJakarta need a decision support system to optimize fleet number operated every time based on passenger number and bus capacity. Because there is uncertainty problem according to passenger number of TransJakarta in real time then fuzzy logic will be fit for this problem. But before develop the decision support system using fuzzy logic, it will be better to build the fuzzy architecture first. This architecture can be used as consideration while develop the system. Its mean that the aim of this research is to make a fuzzy architecture which support the problem. The Data Collection method used is observation. Rules implication method used is MIN method and MAX method for rules composition. While Mamdani is used for the fuzzy inferences system. © 2017 IEEE.","architecture; fuzzy logic; passenger; transjakarta; uncertainty","Architecture; Artificial intelligence; Computer architecture; Computer circuits; Fleet operations; Fuzzy logic; Data collection method; Number of vehicles; passenger; Passenger numbers; Public transportation; transjakarta; uncertainty; Uncertainty problems; Decision support systems",,,,,,"(2015) Statistik Transportasi DKI Jakarta, , Badan Pusat Statistik, Katalog BPS., Badan Pusat Statistik., DKI Jakarta; PT.

As that software productivity growth, several problems has been appeared in software project management especially that correlated to complexity. One of complexity factors is requirement. A unit of requirement used as an option to the design phase of product development. The requirement is also a main option in verification process. So the the requirement complexity in this research is used as parameter to predict the software complexity. Because of the data pattern to connect between the requirement and the complexity is complex. So that this paper attempt to make a connectivity model between requirement complexity and prediction complexity of software using artificial neural network method with Levenberg Marquadt and Bayesian Regulation algorithm. So it can be seen comparison of experimental results by using the two algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.","artificial neural network; complexity; prediction; requirement; software","Computer software; Forecasting; Neural networks; Product design; Productivity; Project management; Software engineering; Artificial neural network methods; Bayesian regulation; complexity; requirement; Software complexity; Software productivity; Software project management; Verification process; Complex networks",,,,,,"Liu, X., (1999) Object-oriented Software Metrics; Na, K., Simpson, J.T., Li, X., Singh, T., Kim, K., Software development risk and project performance measurement (2007) Evidence in Korea, 80, pp. 596-605; Boehm, B., Abts, C., Brown, A., (2000) Cost Estimation with COCOMO II, Ed: Upper Saddle ...; Keshavarz, G., Modiri, N., Pedram, M., Metric for early measurement of software complexity (2011) Interfaces; West, A., Nasa study on flight software complexity (2009) Final Report.

The first two offer more flexibilities but greatly differ in complexities. General-purpose language is probably overkill for a simple data entry application. In order to be useful, domain-specific language should be as close as possible to the problem domain and still open to research. This paper presents Perkedel, a domain-specific programming language designed for data entry. It is inspired by spreadsheet concept and offers user interface definitions that resemble a paper-based data entry form. Spreadsheet is one of the most popular programming systems that has been around us for almost four decades and we argue that easy user interface definition is important. This results in writing source code for a data entry application that looks nothing like ordinary source code. This speeds up the development time, too. One of our respondents spent only five minutes to a develop a simple data entry application, compared to the fastest development time of 32 minutes using a generalpurpose language, for similar application. That way, we hope that Perkedel may add a little perk to data entry developer's life using this data entry language. © 2017 IEEE.","data entry; domain-specific programming language; programming language; spreadsheet","Ada (programming language); Artificial intelligence; Computer programming languages; Data acquisition; Problem oriented languages; Spreadsheets; Development time; Domain specific languages; Domain specific programming languages; General purpose languages; General-purpose programming language; Problem domain; Programming system; Source codes; User interfaces",,,,,,"Soewito, N.B., Gaol, F.L., Abbas, B.S., Multi-platform application user interface design (2017) The International Conference on Advanced Management and Information Technology Service; Van Deursen, A., Klint, P., Domain-specific language design reqires feature description (2002) Journal of Computing and Information Technology, 10 (1), pp. 1-7; Van Deursen, A., Klint, P., Visser, J., (2000) Domain-Specific Language: An Annotated Bibliography, Sigplan Notices, 35 (6), pp. 26-36; Ayalew, Y., Clermont, M., Mittermeir, R.T., Detecting Errors in Spreadsheets, , arXiv preprint arXiv: 0805.1740, 2008; Abraham, R., Burnett, M., Erwig, M., Spreadsheets programming (2008) Wiley Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Engineering; Power, D.J., A brif history of spreadsheets (2004) DSSResources.Com; Nardi, B.A., Miller, J.R., (1990) The Spreadsheets Interface: A Basic for End User Programming, , Hewlett-Packard Laboratories; Sebesta, R.W., (2012) Concepts of Programming Language, , 10 th ed, Pearson Education Inc; Spinellis, D., Notable design patterns for domain specific language (2001) Journal of Systems and Software, 56 (1), pp. 91-99; Mernik, M., Heering, J., Sloane, A.M., When and how to develop domain specific language (2005) ACM Comuting Surveys (CSUR), 37 (4), pp. 316-344",,,"IEEE Indonesia","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2017 IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Computational Intelligence, CyberneticsCOM 2017","20 November 2017 through 22 November 2017",,135216,,9781538607831,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Software size is used to estimate schedule, effort, cost and other resource in software development process. Therefore, the best method to measure software size is to derive software attributes from requirement artifacts to get early estimation. UML sequence diagram chose as source to extract software function, since this diagram provide high level granularity of function. Functional size is measured by using COSMIC method, while structural size is calculated based on control structure on sequence diagram. To automate the measurement process, XML structure of sequence diagram is analyzed to fit existing functional and structural equation. A well-known case study of rice cooker is used to depict the proposed method in this research.

The resemblance value of those documents will be compared based on the percentage of its word resemblance. The similarity value will help to detect plagiarism in documents. Methods used in this application are winnowing algorithm and web-based k-gram. We evaluate the accuracy of the system by comparing the system result with the human result. The differences between the systems and the respondents are 7% with k-gram 25 and 4% with k-gram 20. Moreover, processing time of our application are also discussed. © 2017 IEEE.","k-gram method; plagiarism detection; rabin karp; winnowing algorithm","Artificial intelligence; Websites; Plagiarism detection; Processing time; rabin karp; Web based; Web-based softwares; Intellectual property",,,,,,"Berners-Lee, T., Dimitroyannis, D., Mallinckrodt, A.J., McKay, S., World wide web (1994) Comput.

This research is aimed at exploring the effect of consumer confusion towards purchase intention moderated by omni-channel integration. Inspired by the new concept of omni-channel, this study developed a model of consumer confusion to increase purchase intention. Data was collected from a survey of 442 consumers, and SmartPLS was used as a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) tool to analyse data. As a hypothetical development about omni-channel integration as a part of the e-quality service, this study developed three hypotheses. The results of this study showed that e-WOM has a significant impact on (1) consumer confusion, (2) purchase intention mediated by consumer confusion, and (3) purchase intention mediated by consumer confusion and moderated by quality of omni-channel integration quality. The findings of this study differed from those of previous research. The various opinions and information obtained by consumers through e-WOM increased their confusion, and thus made it difficult for them to make purchasing decisions.

The respondents were 672 teachers of elementary, junior high, high school and vocational school. The number of items planned was 165 items with the initial reliability of 0.98. The ITEI scale uses Likert Scale (1 to 4) which was converted from ordinal scale to Equal Interval Scale. RASCH MODEL analysis was done by selecting based on Outfit Mean Square (MNSQ) between 0.5-1.5 as a good item, and measuring Point Measure Correlation (Pt Mean Corr) with the criterion of 0.4-0.85. Moderate Outfit Z-Standard (ZSTD) was ignored because the sample was >500. Conclusions: ITEI is valid with 30 items and reliability of 0.97, and less engage teachers significantly at α <0.05. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Condensed matter physics; Engineering; Industrial engineering; Materials science; Equal intervals; High school; Likert scale; Mean square; Measuring points; Ordinal scale; Rasch modeling; Vocational schools; Teaching",,,,,,"Rutter, R.A., Jacobson, J.D., Facilitating Teacher Engagement (1986) Educ.

Our novel method successfully restructured the PHP parser and reduced grammar artifact objects that must be visited in a taint analysis process by up to 52% grammar variation. Taint analysis is an analysis that detects any injection vulnerability pattern in source code. The analysis identifies the information flow of untrustworthy input that affects the sensitive sink or part of the system. The static taint analysis was run on an abstract syntax tree and traversed all nodes. A static taint analysis uses a parser to traverse abstract syntax trees of the source code. A web PHP parser has 140 grammar combinations in an abstract syntax tree, which has to be traversed to recognize the tainted flow pattern. Additionally, there are many variations of syntax and coding styles for tainted flow patterns. Therefore, the amount of combinations will consume many computation resources. © 2018 The Authors.

The research focuses on conception, design, implementation and evaluation of the learning object management hypermedia API. The hypermedia API was designed based on learning object models, hypermedia concepts, and related studies. Learning object model can be represented and manipulated as a hypermedia resource. It contains page resources with text and links to multimedia elements. The hypermedia API was designed using UML and represented in HTML5 because of its rich affordance. The implementation and evaluation phase were conducted by testing the API using three different client's software to prove the concept of hypermedia as the engine of application state for managing learning objects. The results show that the hypermedia API for learning object management is accessible, consistent, and discoverable by heterogonous client applications. © 2018 The Authors.

The growing presence of social media allows the opportunity for the branding and marketing of the non-profit organization with limited resources but demand high impact. Museum industry in Indonesia needs to preserve and communicate their culture to the public with limited financial and human resources. Social media was proven to solve this problem. The data was collected from a sample of 63 respondents using a questionnaire. The data were analyzed using descriptive analysis. The results were most of the social media users are in the productive age who have the minimum an undergraduate education, and most of them live in Java. They are not visiting the museum frequently, and their visiting purposes are to learn or study about Indonesia culture triggered by their school, relaxing, personal desires, and visit by accident. They know information about the museum from the search engine, offline, and social media. Most of the museum in Indonesia give bad experience to their visitor, and only some offer a positive experience. The limited social media users in Indonesia, who already aware of museum presence in social media, utilize it to get information about the museum (profile, exhibition, collection, and news), socializing with other social media members, and showing their existence in society. They suggest that museum management should update their social media frequently. This study examines the characteristics of Facebook Fan Page Museum user (age group, gender, residence location, and education level) and their behavior in using Facebook Fan Page Museum. Since there is no research in this field in Indonesia, the findings can be used by museum managers for managing their social media in marketing and education for the community. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Edutainment Marketing; Indonesia Museum; Museum Social Media; Online Visitor Behavior; Online Visitor Expectation",,,,,,,"Hassan, A.I., Crotti, R., El Hassan, G., Haddad, C., Jain, C., Le Quesne, K., Misrah, T., Segal, H., The Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2015 (2015) World Economic Forum; Isacsson, U., Facebook as an Edutainment Medium to Engage Students in Sustainability and Tourism (2011) J.

Task ranking is one of the problems that can be solved by using a machine learning algorithm ranking problem. This work focuses on finding the right approach and corresponding algorithms in the process of ranking to be able to help people in determining which jobs have a higher priority than others. Our approach is to compare several algorithms performed in the process of ranking that are Bipartite Ranking, k-partite Ranking, and Ranking by pairwise comparison. We're used questionnaires and deployment of prototype of Intelligent Personal Assistant Agent to apply the appropriate algorithm in intelligence agent in arranging task priority in daily activity that must be done by the users. After training dataset and evaluate the validation dataset using NDCG, it is found that the collaborative ranking used have a more accurate value / lower variance test evaluation because it uses a large dataset and smaller training dataset. We found that labeling for more than 2 values it is not recommended to use a bipartite ranking if there are many repetitive data, both k-partite ranking and rank by pairwise comparison are able to be used for multi-dimensional data labeling. © 2017 IEEE.","Bipartite Ranking; Intelligence Agent; K-partite Ranking; Ranking by pairwise comparison; Task Ranking","Artificial intelligence; Computer networks; Data handling; Learning systems; Statistical tests; Surveys; Bipartite Ranking; Intelligence agents; K-partite; Ranking by pairwise comparisons; Task Ranking; Learning algorithms",,,,,,"Hang, L.I., A short introduction to learning to rank The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers, Special Section on Information-Based Induction Sciences and Machine Learning, 94 (10). , October 2011; Yorke-Smith, N., Saadati, S., Myers, K.L., Morley, D.N., The design of a proactive personal agent for task management (2012) International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools, 21 (1), p. 1250004; Geng, X., Luo, L., Multilabel ranking with inconsistent rankers 2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3742-3747; Förnkranz, J., Höllermeier, E., Preference learning: An introduction in johannes förnkranz and eyke höllermeier (ed (2010) Preference Learning Springer, pp. 1-17; Cheng, W., Huhn, J., Hullermeier, E., Decision tree and instance-based learning for label ranking (2009) Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 161-168. , Montreal, Canada; Förnkranz, J., Höllermeier, E., Preference learning and ranking by pairwise comparison in johannes förnkranz and eyke höllermeier (2010) Preference Learning Springer, pp. 65-82; Vembu, S., Gärtner, T., Label ranking algorithms: A survey in johannes förnkranz and eyke höllermeier (2010) Preference Learning Springer, pp. 45-64; Raykar, V.C., Yu, S., Eliminating spammers and ranking annotators for crowdsourced labelling tasks (2008) Artificial Intelligence, 172, pp. 1897-1916. , Elsevier; Agarwal, S., Surrogate regret bounds for bipartite ranking via strongly proper losses (2014) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 15, pp. 1653-1674; Agarwal, S., Roth, D., (2005) Learnability of Bipartite Ranking Functions, , P.

This research was aimed to an obtain effective method of micropropagation on Rodent Tuber plant with high rate multiplication factors. The source of explants used the mother plant originating from Medan (Indonesia). MS medium supplemented with the combination of 0.5 mg/L of BAP and various concentrations of NAA was used. Explants were successfully induced in medium containing 0.5 mg/L of BAP and 0.5 mg/L of NAA. Growing media for plant multiplication were ½ MS and MSO. In the treatment media, BAP was given in five different concentrations, i.e. 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mg/L. The result showed that, ½ MS medium added with 1.5 mg/L of BAP was effective in inducing the production of 4.20 ± 1.03 plantlets. In vitro root induction of Rodent Tuber was achieved in MSO medium supplemented with 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mg/L of NAA. MSO medium supplemented with 1.5 mg/L of NAA could induce the formation of 43.20 ± 21.21 new roots. Viability percentages of Rodent Tuber from Medan acclimatization was 100%.

Less availability dataset for research, non-stationary distribution of the data, highly imbalanced class distributions, and continuous streams of transactions become the main driven of using CHAID and k-NN classification method. Empiric result using actual debit card transaction using ATM services shows that Accuracy of CHAID model is 0.8 and F = 0.7; and k-NN model (for k=3) is 0.7 and F = 0.6 These results are comparable to previous studies using Hidden Markov Models. © 2016 IEEE.","CHAID; debit card fraud recognition; k-NN","Classification (of information); Crime; Hidden Markov models; Markov processes; CHAID; Classification models; Debit cards; Fraudulent transactions; Imbalanced class; K-nearest neighbors; K-NN classifications; Transaction records; Nearest neighbor search",,,,,,"Case, P., Sisat, S.N., (2014) Secured Automatic Teller Machine (ATM).

Bina Nusantara (BINUS) University has implemented Knowledge Management System (KMS) since 2002. This study examined the speed performance of content creation in four modules of BINUS University KMS: Documents, Video, Material, and Binuspedia. The examined to get mean value of speed performance was conducted in 3 location campuses of BINUS University: Anggrek Campus, Syahdan Campus and Alam Sutera Campus, each was done with five repetition. The speed performance was analyzed using Two-way ANOVA with interaction approach. According to the experiment results, F calculated for module is greater than F table, F calculated for campus is less than F table and F calculated for interaction is less than F table. Thus, the conclusions are: (1) there are differences in the average value of speed performance for each module, (2) there is no difference in the average value of speed performance for each campus, and (3) there is no interaction between campuses and modules on the speed performance. © 2016 IEEE.","BINUS University; Knowledge Management System; Speed Performance; Two Way ANOVA with Interaction","Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Bins; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Average values; BINUS University; Content creation; F tables; Knowledge management system; Mean values; Speed performance; Two-way ANOVA; Speed",,,,,,"Gourova, E., Toteva, K., Design of knowledge management systems (2015) Proc. 20th Eur.

Previous studies were tested that the omni-channel integration quality can improve customer satisfaction. As a novelty, we introduced omni-channel integration as a moderating variable that influence consumer confusion to the intention of purchase. This paper constituted a hypothetical development about the proposed omni-channel integration as a part of the e-quality service. This proposed research aimed to explore the effect of consumer confusion towards purchase intention moderated by omni-channel integration. In addition, this study discussed about the antecedent of consumer confusion to the intention of purchase, namely e-WOM. Three hypotheses were modeled in this research proposal. The future results of this research were expected to be a significant contribution towards business, science, and society. © 2016 IEEE.","consumer confusion; electronic word of mouth; omni-channel integration quality; purchase intention","Customer satisfaction; Information management; Integration; Purchasing; consumer confusion; Development plans; Electronic word of mouths; Purchase intention; Quality services; Research proposals; Sales",,,,,,"(2015) B2C E-commerce Sales in Indonesia from 2011 to 2016, , http//www.statista.com/statistics/280925/b2c-ecommerce-sales-in-indonesia/, Statista; (2015) Profil Pengguna Internet Indonesia 2014, , APJII,rfsti Jakarta: Puskakom UI; Nielsen, (2014) E-commerce: Evolution or Revolution in the Fast-moving Consumer Goods World; (2015) Mobile Commercce Growing Fast in Asia Pacific with Half of Smartphone Uses Now Shopping in Their Device, , Mastercard; (2015) State of Mobile Commerce: Apps and Cross-device Lead Mobile Business, , Criteo; Stelzer, J., New insights into the ever-evolving consumer (2014) IBM Commerce Blog, , https//www.ibm.com/blogs/commerce/2014/11/new-insights-everevolving-consumer/, November 5; (2014) Online Shopper Study IDEA Roundtable, , Google; (2014) Customer Desires Vs .

Trust is very important in e-commerce. The nature of online shopping has a greater uncertainty than offline shopping. Seeing as there is an uncertainty that can produce risks, a prospective buyer's trust is needed. A lot of people's unwillingness to shop online is caused by their lack of trust toward e-commerce. E-commerce is said to be one of the ways for SME to compete with bigger companies. However, building trust requires immense time and cost. SME with limited resources may experience difficulties in building trust just with their own resources. Base on literature research that needs to be validated in next research, we found that trust can be built through trust transfer from the reputable and well-known trust-mark issuer, and third party protection such as escrow account service and credit card issuer. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Commerce; Account services; Literature researches; Online shopping; Primary objective; Prospective buyers; Small medium enterprise; Third parties; Trust transfer; Electronic commerce",,,,,,"(2014), Google (Jakarta) Online Shopper Study : IDEA Roundtable; (2013) Trust Marks Report 2013 : ""can i Trust the Trust Mark?"", , The European Consumer Centres'Network; (2015) Profil Pengguna Internet Indonesia 2014, , Asosiasi Penyelenggara Jasa Internet Indonesia and Puskakom UI (Jakarta: Pertama); Li, X., Rong, G., Thatcher, J.B., DO we trust the technology?

Psychiatrists use client-centered therapy to recognize five symptoms of schizophrenia. They comprise: delusions, hallucinations, negative symptoms, grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior, and disorganized thinking and speech. Patients experiencing their acute psychotic episode must be quarantined to prevent their unsocial behavior. An early detection of the schizophrenia symptoms is necessary to avoid acute psychotic episodes. An expert system to aid in diagnosing early schizophrenia symptoms is presented in the paper. The system represents psychiatrist knowledge in the form of rules, facts and events and uses them to assess whether a patient suffers from schizophrenia. The knowledge-base is displayed in the form of questions to the patient. The expert system uses forward chaining while gathering the answers from patient. All answers are transformed into facts and processed using Boolean reasoning to generate the diagnosis. The diagnosis states whether the patient has schizophrenia, and if so, it indicates also the type of schizophrenia. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Boolean reasoning; Expert system; Schizophrenia; Symptoms","Database systems; Diagnosis; Expert systems; Knowledge based systems; Boolean reasoning; Knowledge base; Motor behavior; Schizophrenia; Symptoms; Diseases",,,,,,"(2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5, , 5th edn.).

The most widely used car-following model is the Gazis-Herman-Rothery model, which contains two coefficients: m and l. The coefficients should be determined in calibration tests where the involved vehicles are tracked for their positions, velocities, and accelerations. The existing calibration methods are costly. This study proposes a calibration method using computer vision. Two computer vision algorithms are evaluated, namely, multilayer and Eigen background subtraction. The vehicle movement is tracked on a perspective plane and then is projected to an orthogonal plane. From the verification tests, we determine that the multilayer algorithm has 96.6% accuracy for the vehicle position and 88.9% for the velocity. The Eigen algorithm has 92.9% accuracy for the vehicle position and 84.3% for the velocity. The estimated model coefficients is 0.4 for m and 1.2 for l. These values are within the range of the most reliable coefficients according to many literatures. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.","Car-following model; Computer vision; Micro-simulation; Vehicle tracking","Calibration; Database systems; Multilayers; Tracking (position); Traffic control; Vehicles; Background subtraction; Car following models; Car-following modeling; Computer vision algorithms; Gazis-Herman-Rothery models; Microsimulation; Multilayer algorithms; Vehicle interactions; Computer vision",,,,,,"(2013), http://www.bps.go.id/linkTabelStatis/view/id/1413; Morichi, S., Long-term strategy for transport system in Asian megacities (2005) J.

Usually, consumer will do a strategy to coping the confusion, that strategy is known as Confusion Reduction Strategy. The conventional ways usually taken by the consumer to reduce the confusion are, such as: Asking for product recommendation to close relatives, seeking for an additional product information on the internet and so on. However, suggestions and recommendations from conventional sources obtained by the consumer, sometimes are not always accurate (not objective) and time consuming (inefficient). Therefore, this research proposes a Decision Support System (DSS) application to cope with the confusion. In this study, the comparison results between conventional methods (such as: Asking advice to close relatives or seeking for an additional information on the internet) with the proposed method (the DSS) were presented. In addition, another implication of this study is to get the factors that causing consumer confusion in case of smartphone purchases. This research used mixed-method approach, implemented through interview and survey. Research samples were 136 potential smartphone buyers which are converted to 27 smartphone buyers; brand image is the main source of consumer confusion (mean 3.98, std. dev 0.86), followed by proliferation of brands, services and models of smartphone products (mean 3.89, std. dev 0.82). Respondents often use Word of Mouth (WoM) communication as main source of information to reduce the confusion, results of 16 from 27 transactions were contributed from WoM. DSS application contributed only 2 of 27 smartphone transactions. Further research for the development of mobile based DSS application as an alternative conventional CRS needs to be conducted, because of the potential success of static desktop based DSS application in reducing potential consumer confusion especially for value oriented buyers. © 2014 Science Publication.","Confusion Reduction Strategy; Consumer Confusion; Decision Support System; Fuzzy Logic; Simple Additive Weighting",,,,,,,"Afshari, A., Mojahed, M., Yusuff, R.M., Simple additive weighting approach to personnel selection problem (2010) Int.

Building an efficient mass transportation system is clearly necessary. However, implementing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have also been demonstrated effective in various advanced countries. Recently, the floating vehicle technique (FVT), an ITS implementation, has become cost effective to provide real-time traffic information with proliferation of the smartphones. Although many publications have discussed various issues related to the technique, none of them elaborates the discrepancy of a single floating car data (FCD) and the associated fleet data. This work addresses the issue based on an analysis of Sugiyama et al's experimental data. The results indicate that there is an optimum averaging time interval such that the estimated velocity by the FVT reasonably representing the traffic velocity. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,,"Morichi, S., (2005) Journal of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies, 6, p. 1; Nelson, J.D., Blundell, S., Pettitt, P., Thompson, S., (2001) Transport Review, 21, p. 51; Toshitaka, M., (2007) Japan ITS Handbook 2006-2007, , Highway industry development organization; Chen, K., Miles, J.C., (1999) ITS Handbook 2000: Recommendations from the World Road Association (PIARC), , Artech House; Sanwal, K.K., Walrand, J., (1995) California PATH Working Paper UCB-ITS-PWP-95-11, , Tech. rep., University of California, Berkeley; Cathey, F., Dailey, D., Transit vehicles as traffic probe sensors (2001) Proceedings IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems, pp. 579-584; Dai, X., Ferman, M., Roesser, R., A simulation evaluation of a real-time traffic information system using probe vehicles (2003) Intelligent Transportation Systems, 2003, Proceedings. 2003 IEEE, 1; Fabritiis, C.D., Ragona, R., Valenti, G., Traffic estimation and prediction based on real time floating car data (2008) 11th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems; Uno, N., Kurauchi, F., Tamura, H., Iida, Y., (2009) Intelligent Transportation Systems, 13 (2); Liu, K., Yamamoto, T., Morikawa, T., (2009) Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems, 13, p. 16; Herrera, J.C., Work, D.B., Herring, R., Ban, X., Jacobson, Q., Bayen, A.M., (2010) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 18, p. 568; Campolo, C., Iera, A., Molinaro, A., Paratore, S.Y., Ruggeri, G., SMaRTCaR: An integrated smartphone-based platform to support traffic management applications (2012) First International Workshop on Vehicular Traffic Management for Smart Cities (VTM); Jenelius, E., Koutsopoulos, H.N., (2013) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 53, p. 64; Rahmani, M., Koutsopoulos, H.N., (2013) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 30, p. 41; Sugiyama, Y., Fukui, M., Kikuchi, M., Hasebe, K., Nakayama, A., Nishinari, K., Ichi Tadaki, S., Yukawa, S., (2008) New Journal of Physics, 10, p. 033001; De Boor, C., (2001) A Practical Guide to Splines, , Springer Verlag; De Lillo, F., Cecconi, F., Lacorata, G., Vulpiani, A., (2008) EPL, 84; De Luca, L.T., (2009) Propulsion Physics, , (EDP Sciences, Les Ulis","Gunawan, F.E.; Bina Nusantara University, 11480 Jakarta, Indonesia; email: fgunawan@binus.edu",,"","EDP Sciences","2013 International Conference on Advances Science and Contemporary Engineering, ICASCE 2013","23 October 2013 through 24 October 2013","Jakarta",,21016275,,,,"English","EPJ Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901428304

Individuals who have had their first stroke with permanent damage could become an economic burden to their family and a social burden to the society due to their unproductive nature. Stroke could be prevented and its risk factors have been identified. Through a stroke prevention information system, the user could be made more aware of stroke risks and symptoms. An expert system would be able to direct and motivate users to keep themselves healthy therefore preventing first and recurrent strokes. The expert system is built using an inference engine that provides stroke risk level based on information provided by the user. Information collected are self measured blood pressure, cigarettes consumed, amount of physical activity and body mass index. Users are presented with suggested preventive tasks to reduce their stroke risk. © 2013 Science Publications.",,,,,,,,"(2012) About Stroke, , ASA, American Heart Association; Biswas, M.M., Sen, S., Simmons, J., Etiology and risk factors of ischemic stroke in Indian- American patients from a hospital-based registry in New Jersey (2009) USA.

System effectiveness is defined as the combined measure of availability and reliability at each task-arrival time, when transient human operator behavior was considered in conjunction with the machine state. Because factors such as fatigue, stress, and learning affect the human operator over time, all probability measures for successful human performance are considered to be time-dependent. Performance evaluation models for a generic military system are developed. The modeling techniques can also be used for large-scale, man-machine systems that consist of modern computers and processors. © 1990 IEEE",,"Human Engineering; Military Engineering; Probability--Random Processes; Human-Machine Systems; Poisson Process; Stochastic Effectiveness Models; Task-Arrival Time; Systems Science and Cybernetics",,,,"Agricultural Research Development Agency, ARDA

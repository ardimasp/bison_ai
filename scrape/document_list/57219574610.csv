It has been research yet the notion about digital literacy review which showed the big picture using data from all countries. This research aims to study the status of international digital literacy research that is indexed by Scopus using scientometric mapping. The study has carried out scientometric methods and analyzed research data using the analyze search results service from Scopus and the VOSviewer application. The research data of 2, 749 documents published from 1997 to 2019 were obtained from the Scopus database. The results showed an increasing trend in the number of digital literacy publications at the international level each year. Most countries, affiliation, and authors in digital literacy research were the United States, Monash University, and Marsh, J. The most intensive subject areas and sources of publications in digital literacy research are computer science and the ACM international conference proceeding series. There were two collaborative researchers' patterns in digital literacy research. This research proposes a convergence axis classification consisting of digital literacy research to characterize the body of knowledge generated from two decades of research: Learning, Information communication, Technology, Human, and Education, abbreviated as LITHE themes. © 2020 IEEE.","Digital literacy; Scientometric; Scopus; Vosviewer","Information management; Mapping; Body of knowledge; Digital literacies; Digital resources; Industrial revolutions; Information communication; Research data; Scientometrics; Scopus database; Classification (of information)",,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC

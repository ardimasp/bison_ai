As an emerging non thermal technology, cold plasma could be used to give a pretreatment to a thermal-sensitive material, such as pretreatment to seeds of bell pepper prior to be planted in soil to understand the effect of this dry process during the germination period. In this experiment, the used argon plasma was generated by flowing argon gas with the rate of 2 L/min through a positively charged of stainless pipe at a distance of 15 mm from aluminum plate electrode. With an applied voltage of 9.8 kV (peak-to-peak) electrical energy from a high voltage AC power supply, argon plasma irradiation was employed to the bell pepper seeds for a predetermined period of time as pretreatment to the seeds during pre-planting. It was found that the temperature of the plasma never exceeded 35°C during the plasma irradiation to assure that no thermal damage occurred to the seeds. It was also confirmed from this study that by giving non thermal plasma treatment for 30 minutes to the seeds may enhance the germination of the bell pepper plants up to 90% in stem length and almost 2.5 times in root length compared to the pepper without treatment. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","agriculture; green bell pepper; Non-thermal plasma; seed germination","Agriculture; Argon; Bells; Cultivation; Electric power systems; Irradiation; Plasma applications; Shotcreting; Argon plasma treatment; Bell peppers; Non-thermal plasma treatment; Non-thermal technology; Nonthermal plasma; Plasma irradiations; Seed germination; Thermal sensitive material; Seed",,,,,"Lu, P., Cullen, P.J., Ostrikov, K., (2016) Cold Plasma in Food and Agriculture Fundamentals and Applications, pp. 83-116; Weizong, W., Danhua, M., Xin, T., Annemie, B., Gliding arc plasma for CO2 conversion: Better insights by a combined experimental and modelling approach (2017) Chemical Engineering Journal, 330, pp. 11-25; Zhang, S., Rousseau, A., Dufour, T., Promoting lentil germination and stem growth by plasma activated tap water, demineralized water and liquid fertilizer (2017) RSC Advances, 7 (50), pp. 31244-31251; Vlasta, S., Pavel, S., Jakub, K., Jan, P., Milan, S., Monika, S., Jana, J., Mirko, C., Atmospheric pressure plasma treatment of agricultural seeds of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) with effect on reduction of diseases and germination improvement (2017) Plasma Processes and Polymers, 15 (2); Je-Wook, K., Pradeep, P., Chulkyoon, M., Effect of corona discharge plasma jet on surface-borne microorganisms and sprouting of broccoli seeds (2016) Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 97 (1), pp. 128-134; Khanit, M., Non-thermal plasma for germination enhancement of radish seeds (2016) Procedia Computer Science, 86, pp. 132-135; Florian, J., Stephane, S., Christophe, B., Thierry, D., Plasma-activation of tap water using DBD for agronomy applications: Identification and quantification of long lifetime chemical species and production/consumption mechanisms (2018) Water Research, 133, pp. 47-59; Samarah, N.H., Wang, H., Welbaum, G.E., Pepper (Capsicum annuum) seed germination and vigour following nanochitin, chitosan or hydropriming treatments (2016) Seed Science and Technology, 44 (3), pp. 609-615; Waranyoo, K., Phirayot, K., Ponlawat, U., Improved germination and vigour of sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.)

The load from containers quite high and will stay for a long period. Without soil improvement, the estimated consolidation settlement is 1.418 m, which will take place in a very long time. Soil improvement has carried out by accelerating consolidation, by installing vertical jute fiber-drain, and loading the soil by a preload of sand to elevation of +8.50 m. To investigate the effectiveness of the installed vertical jute fiber-drain, geotechnical instruments also installed, which are settlement plate, standpipe piezometers, pneumatic piezometers, magnetic extensometers, and inclinometers. Vertical jute fiber-drain is a Prefabricated Vertical Drain (PVD) made of natural jute fiber and coconut coir designed to accelerate consolidation of soft clayey soil. It has high tensile strength to withstand installation stresses and excellent water discharge capacity. The cross section of natural fiber PVD measures 80-120 mm in width and 8-12 mm in thickness and have a tensile strength of above 7 kN. The present drain differs from the others drain is that its manufactured in existing jute mills machinery, the manufacturing process entails low energy consumption, and has capability of varying the width, thickness and weight per linear meter to suit different soft clayey soil conditions. An important feature of the jute burlap is its swelling nature that allows it to function as filter without clogging and it's biodegradable, hence environmentally friendly. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

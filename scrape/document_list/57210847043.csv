This article is valuable to extend the comprehension and knowledge of SME’s entrepreneurship to obtain innovation performance through digital business strategies and these efforts are encouraged by effectuation decision-making logic. This survey targets the manufacturing of small and medium-scale food and beverage SMEs in Indonesia. A total of 52 SME entrepreneurs were selected as the respondent in this research. The data obtained from the collecting of the online questionnaires were analyzed using Moderating Regression Analysis with SPSS for data analysis. The successful entrepreneurial SMEs enhance their innovation performance by improving managerial-operational capability. Effectuation decision-making logic contributes more to strengthening the relationship between managerial capability with innovation performance than operational capability with innovation performance. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Effectuation; Innovation Performance; Managerial Capability; Operational Capability",,,,,,,"Agostini, L., Nosella, A., Filippini, R., Towards an integrated view of the ambidextrous organization: A second-order factor model (2016) Creativity and Innovation Management, 25 (1), pp. 129-141; Agostini, L., Nosella, A., Filippini, R., Does intellectual capital allow improving innovation performance?

How- ever, there are still limited survey papers that provide the indicators, methods, and the examples of the Smart City cases. This research aims to provide a systematic and com- prehensive survey using a systematic literature review method, on indicators, methods, and the examples of the Smart City cases. This literature review contributes to the foun- dation of the research in the area of Smart City. The method used in this paper is a sys- tematic and comprehensive literature review proposed by Ridley and Okoli & Schabram. The results show that Smart Environment is the most paramount indicator used in the literature. Moreover, some characteristics generally appear in the studies such as: Small scale implementation, the readiness of the laws & regulations as well as the technology. © 2020 ICIC International.

Several cases had been reported due to the usage of a fake transcript. One modus of using fake transcript is to enter a higher level of education and job promotion. The new technology found called Blockchain believes in solving the problem. Characteristics of Blockchain Technology such as secured, immutable, distributed, transparent seem to be matched with transcript document requirement. Therefore, the research tries to create a process model of the university teaching and learning process. Several studies have been done; however, no detailed process shown especially for teaching and learning activities. The research question is, how are teaching, and learning activities can be supported by Blockchain Technology? Qualitative method used in this research, focus group discussion with 9 reputable universities discussed the academic operation process and the result show that it is possible to adopt Blockchain Technology into the teaching and learning process to avoid forgery of university transcript documents. © 2020 IEEE.","Blockchain technology; Blockchain technology-based; Teaching and learning process; Transcript","Blockchain; Information management; Teaching; Innovative solutions; Learning Activity; Level of educations; Operation process; Qualitative method; Research questions; Teaching and learning; University teaching; Learning systems",,,,"12/AKM/PNT/2019","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This study is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Implementasi Blockchain Platform Untuk Menciptakan “Good Governance” pada Perguruan Tinggi” or “The Implementation of Blockchain Platform to Create“Good Governance” in Higher Education” with contract number: 12/AKM/PNT/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","Ari, S., (2015) Perguruan Tinggi Harus Waspadai Transkrip Nilai Palsu-Tribun Jogja, , https://jogja.tribunnews.com/2015/01/09/perguruan-tinggi-haruswaspadai-transkrip-nilai-palsu, jogja.

Educators and institutions are unsure which digital content is the most appropriate to improve a student’s skills. For this study, an experimental design method using a control-group pretest-posttest was conducted to compare learning outcomes through the implementation of digital content in blended learning for computer programming. The instrument used was a programming case. The factor and level tested included various digital content types, and the desired response was an increment in learning outcomes. This study concludes that there is a significant increment in the average scores of groups that are using Ebooks in blended learning—not video as many educators may think. Results of this study include a recommendation for educators and institutions in applying and determining which digital content is the most appropriate to improve students’ programming skills in blended learning. © Common Ground Research Networks, Budi Yulianto, Harjanto Prabowo, Raymond Kosala, Ford Lumban Gaol, All Rights Reserved.

The fact, many companies have failed to implement ERP which is proven to be not go live on time, so that the implementation value is to be very expensive. For this reason, it is important to consider other methods that can reduce failures in implementing ERP that are reviewed from the perspective of readiness assessment. Based on previous research, there are some challenging on the ERP readiness assessment. We also found that some areas on the ERP readiness that still not explore more serious such as ERP and agile method. Therefore, based on the challenging and open are on the ERP readiness, we will explore more development the framework of ERP readiness assessment using agile parameters to help the industry. The purpose of this research is to identify gaps and propose improvements which are the weaknesses in order to improve performance of the organization. The result of this research is developing the framework using an agile parameter for determination of the ERP readiness assessment with a case study in the textile industry in Indonesia. Hopefully, this research has contribution as a measurement tool for assessing the organizational readiness in order to increase agility in the industry. This research methodology uses the combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods using the NVivo software as a result of FGD data processing and using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity (TOPSIS) for validation and verification tests. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Nowadays, many companies are turning to freelancing rather than hiring full-time employees. In addition, the workers have also switched to working as freelancers. New problems also arise in the crowdwork system. Trust is one of the main issues that arise in the crowdwork system. It happens because the job providers and workers do not meet each other on the crowdwork portal. This research aims to examine the components that affect trust in a crowdwork system. The benefit is that stakeholders can be aware of how to increase trust in the crowdwork system. The method used in this research is systematic literature review, by analyzing Scopus based journals related to trust in the crowdwork system. This research produces 11 components and 38 indicators. There are three components that needs concern to stakeholders who want to take advantage of crowdwork systems and focus on trust. These components are reciprocal voting, monetary reward, and cognitive effort. The platform should enable stakeholders to have reciprocal voting, less cognitive effort, as well as clean and clear monetary reward procedure. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

There is much information and knowledge that are discussed among a lecturer and students in forums as a part of the learning process. The motivation of this study is to evaluate the learning process in a discussion forum through a dashboard, namely, the Dashboard of Knowledge (DoK). The DoK is formed using an Information Retrieval Architecture and Entity Relationship Diagram that is designed using four category interfaces. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the learning evaluation through the DoK is measured by a survey. The survey is conducted using three out of four dimensions of multi-criteria of the Web-based E-Learning System (WELS), namely, the Learner Interface, the System Context, and Personalization. The respondents of the survey are the heads of department that are DoK users. The results show that most respondents strongly agree that the DoK is useful for evaluating the learning in a discussion forum. This is exhibited by the survey results that show an average score of 3.53 out of 4.00 and 84.32% satisfaction. These results reveal that the DoK can effectively assist heads of department in monitoring the effectiveness of the learning process in a discussion forum. © 2013 IEEE.","Data warehouses; discussion forums; e-learning","Data warehouses; E-learning; Surveys; Discussion forum; Entity relationship diagrams; Four dimensions; Learning evaluations; Learning management system; Learning process; Personalizations; Web-based e-learning systems; Learning systems",,,,,,"Garrison, D., Kanuka, H., Blended learning: Uncovering its transformative potential in higher education (2004) Internet Higher Edu., 7 (2), pp. 95-105. , Apr; Tripathi, R., Kurle, D., Jalgaonkar, S., Sarkate, P., Rege, N., Implementation of supplemental E-learning models for blended learning in pharmacology (2017) Nat.

Despite a discussion is opened by submitting a thread as the topic of discussion, however, the discussion may open out to different topics. This paper aims to present a model to find out a topic of discussion through latent semantic approach, named Topics Finding Model (TFM). The model proposes a complete step to reveal the topic of discussion from a thread in a discussion forum, consisting of the pre-processing text document, corpus classification and finding a topic. The model can be applied in various discussion forums and various languages with a few adjustments, such as stop-word removal list and stemming algorithm. The data were obtained from discussion forum in a learning management system. The data consist of 1050 posts divided into three different course subjects: information systems, management, and character building. The reason for using several course subjects is to observe consistency of the model. F-measure was used to measure the effectiveness of the model, and the results showed that the TFM was consistent and effective to reveal the topic of discussion, with a good precision. However, the recall can still be increased in a further study. © 2019, The Author(s).","Discussion forum; Latent semantic; Learning management system; Topics finding model",,,,,,,"Baeza-Yates, R., Ribeiro-Neto, B., (2011) Modern Information Retrieval: The Concept and Technology behind Search (Second Edition), , Addison-Wesley Professional Harlow; Benedetti, F., Beneventano, D., Bergamaschi, S., Simonini, G., Computing inter-document similarity with context semantic analysis (2018) Information Systems, 80, pp. 136-147; Berger, A., Lafferty, J., Information retrieval as statistical translation (1999) In Proceedings of the 22Nd Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, , https://doi.org/10.1145/312624.312681; Botev, V., Marinov, K., Schäfer, F., Word importance-based similarity of documents metric (WISDM): Fast and scalable document similarity metric for analysis of scientific documents (2017) Proceedings of the 6Th International Workshop on Mining Scientific Publications, 7, pp. 17-23. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3127526.3127530; Cutting, D.R., Karger, D.R., Pedersen, J.O., Tukey, J.W., Scatter/gather: A cluster-based approach to browsing large document collections (2017) ACM SIGIR Forum, 51, pp. 148-159. , &; Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (1999) Proceedings of the fifteenth conference on uncertainty, pp. 1-7; Ezen-Can, A., Boyer, K.E., Kellogg, S., Booth, S., Unsupervised modeling for understanding MOOC discussion forums: A learning analytics approach (2015) In Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, pp. 146-150; Hofmann, T., Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (1999) Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 289-296; Hofmann, T., Unsupervised learning by probabilistic latent semantic analysis (2001) Machine Learning, 42 (1-2), pp. 177-196; Hong, C., Chen, W., Zheng, W., Shan, J., Chen, Y., Zhang, Y., Parallelization and characterization of probabilistic latent semantic analysis (2008) Parallel processing, 2008.

It takes a place that can channel the hidden knowledge into new knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to find out the mapping of community learning in informal education to support learning communities. Some of the previous studies of Learning Community were able to create smart, skilled, independent and competitiveness communities with learning programs at formal education. The internet community and media make a distance not an obstacle for people who exchange ideas. The power of bonding makes people help each other like families who have the same responsibilities. Community-based learning becomes an alternative in the future, where conventional learning will gradually be abandoned. Learning Community in the context of informal education is an alternative for busy individuals and it is difficult to find time to share knowledge. The method used is by survey method by defining the scope in detail, and determining the research question; do a search that involves selecting literary sources based on keywords, and determine inclusion and exclusion criteria to sort the types of references for further exploration. Community-based learning has unique things related to the learning process that is not possessed by formal education, among others, the interaction between community members, collaboration in sharing knowledge, quick feedback in solving problems, and self-reflection that often expresses opinions. unthinkable, the creation of actualization, problem-solving and learning by doing as well as learning community learning can also be done with experience-based learning. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Surveys; Community learning; Experience-based learning; Explicit knowledge; Inclusion and exclusions; Informal educations; Internet communities; Learning community; Research questions; E-learning",,,,,,"Zavratnik, V., Kos, A., Stojmenova Duh, E., Smart villages: Comprehensive review of initiatives and practices (2018) Sustainability, 10 (7), p. 2559; Haron, H., Aziz, N.H.N., Harun, A., A conceptual model participatory engagement within e-learning community (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 116, pp. 242-250; Mundschenk, N.A., Fuchs, W.W., Professional learning communities: An effective mechanism for the successful implementation and sustainability of response to intervention (2016) SRATE Journal, 25 (2), pp. 55-64; Iverson, J.O., McPhee, R.D., Knowledge management in communities of practice: Being true to the communicative character of knowledge (2002) Management Communication Quarterly, 16 (2), pp. 259-266; Crowe, K., D'Andrade, A., Engaging community members in providing support for the dying and the bereaved: Activities in social work community practice (2018) Families in Society, 99 (4), pp. 338-346; Keeble, L., Loader, B., Community informatics (2001) Community Informatics.

Despite its importance, many healthcare challenges exist, as a result of increased costs that are not associated with the quality of healthcare. Consequently, the primary purpose of this investigation is to examine the role of information technology (IT) in mediating the effect of medical resources on clinical performance. Medical resources were measured using human resource and medical technology dimensions. The research capability is referred to as IT and knowledge management capabilities. An empirical survey was conducted at 34 accredited hospitals located in the Special Capital Region of Jakarta. A multivariate statistical analysis, applying structural equation modeling – partial least squares, revealed that the role of IT capabilities were statistically significant in mediating the effect of medical human resources on clinical performance. No significant direct effect of medical resources on clinical performance was observed.

In addition, a decrease in sales prices due to competition causes the level of profitability to fall. This condition is thought to be related to problems in collaboration strategies and market attractiveness. So based on this background, this study aims to examine the effect of market attractiveness and collaboration strategies on the business performance of the digital OOH media industry in Indonesia. The type of research used in this study is verification. The unit of analysis and unit of observation in this study is the management of the company's business units which are included in the digital OOH media industry in Indonesia. The research data collected is in the time horizon that is cross-sectional / one shoot. This study uses a multivariate statistics analysis method using PLS. The study population amounted to 183, the sample was taken as many as 118 using simple random sampling which was distributed to 3 major cities namely Jakarta, Surabaya, and Bandung, based on a list of members of the population in each city as a sampling frame. The results of the study show that market attractiveness and collaboration strategies influence business performance. Collaboration strategies have a greater influence than market attractiveness in ac hieving business performance. The results of this study have implications for the management of digital OOH media industry companies that improving business performance rests on a collaboration strategy that is supported by adaptation to market attractiveness. © IJSTR 2019.","Business performance; Collaboration strategy; Digital out of home (OOH) media; Market attractiveness",,,,,,,"Best, R.J., (2009) Market-Based Management Strategies for Growing., , Customer Value and Profitability Fifth Edition.

The focus of this study was HEI in Indonesia, that was the HEI’s National Quality Assurance Standard as a case. To define the component, this study applied a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to clarifying the composition of the EA framework. There were two EA frameworks that had been commonly used in HEI to further analyze the study, which were TOGAF and Zachman. The same process was done to define the HEI governance component. To seek the update education situation in 4.0 era, the exploration search was not just from HEI quality assurance and HEI value chain, but it came also from the future university. As a result, the EA component has seven groups and eight groups of components for HEI. Component between EA and HEI map was used to seek the relationship between components. HEI can use the map as a guideline when deciding to implement EA in their organization. Another result is that there are 16 components that are not directly discussed as Indonesia’s National Quality Assurance Standard. © 2019 ICIC International.","EA framework; Enterprise arhiteture; Higher eduation institution; Institution governanes; Systemati literature review",,,,,,,"de Vries, M., van Rensburg, A.C.J., Evaluating and refining the “enterprise arhiteture as strategy” approah and artefats (2009) The South African Journal of Industrial Engineering, 20 (1), pp. 31-44; (2018) University of the Future Bringing Education 4.0: Bringing Education to Life; Jairak, K., Praneetpolgrang, P., Applying IT governane balaned soreard and importane-performane analysis for providing IT governane strategy in university (2013) Information Management & Computer Security, 21 (4), pp. 228-249; Llamosa-Villalba, R., Carreño, L.T., Paez, Q.A.M., Delgado, Q.D.J., Barajas, A.B., Sney-Der, E.G., (2015) Enterprise Arhiteture of Olombian Higher Eduation, IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE); (2015) Social CRM in Higher Education: Model, Process, Channel Preference, and Critical Success Factors, , Ph.D. Thesis, University of Indonesia; Oderinde, D.O., (2012) Understanding Enterprise Architecture in Four UK Universities, , Ph.D. Thesis, University of Bolton; Tjong, Y., Adi, S., Kosala, R., Prabowo, H., A systemati mapping study on enterprise arhiteture mining (2018) International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Technology, pp. 403-411; Bokor, J., (2012) University of the Future: A Thousand Year Old Industry on the Usp of Profound Hange, , Ernst and Young; Zandi, F., Tavana, M., A fuzzy group multi-riteria enterprise arhiteture framework seletion model (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39 (1), pp. 1165-1173",,,,"ICIC International",,,,,21852766,,,,"English","ICIC Express Lett Part B Appl.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073316162

In the context of Information Overload, an additional load of information does not always increase benefits to users. In the previous study, a KMS MR framework was designed to address Information Overload. Following that, this research follows through earlier research by experimenting with a case study. The case study involved students working on quizzes that were allowed to open the Internet, open books, and KMS applications with a 30-minute time limit. In this baseline, the research question ushers on the impact of the implementation of the KMS MR framework in the case study and whether to improve the information quality perceived by students. The research method is based on experimental, questionnaires and statistics for processing data and decision making. In addition, this study intends to evince the reliability of the KMS MR framework in overcoming the Information Overload issue. At the end of the study, the results indicated the gap of 1.50 points as the differences in the value of information quality between the two groups of KMS MR and KMS. Per this outcome, the KMS MR framework is capable of improving the information quality and shifting the culmination point of Information Overload. © 2019 ISSN.","Case study; Information overload (IO); KMS MR; Knowledge management system (KMS); MapRe-duce",,,,,,,"Eppler, M.

The internal readiness factors of Small-and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) have a significant influence on the intention of adopting e-business in SMEs. Further, external readiness factors of Small-and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) also have a significant influence on the intention of adopting e-business in SMEs. The population of the study was SMEs producing textile products, handicrafts, and Moslem clothing in Cipadu Jaya, Larangan, Tangerang. The method of sampling was simple random sampling with 183 SMEs as samples. The study employed Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with WarpPLS Software 6.0 for data analysis. The findings indicate that the adoption of e-commerce within SMEs was affected by Relative advantage, Compatibility, Cost, Firm size, Organizational readiness, Information intensity and product characteristics, Industry pressure, Government pressure, Consumer readiness, Support from technology vendors, CEO innovativeness, and CEOs involvement. © 2019 IEEE.","adoption of e-business; global competitiveness; SMEs empowerment; strategy","Electronic commerce; Employment; Information management; eBusiness; Global competitiveness; Organizational readiness; Product characteristics; Small and medium-sized enterprise; SMEs empowerment; strategy; Structural equation modeling; Competition",,,,,,"Ayandibu, A.O., Houghton, J., The role of small and medium scale enterprise in local economic development (led) (2017) J.

Productivity is a demand for improving organizational performance. ERP systems are a way to increase productivity. Therefore, ERP implementation is important to ensure that ERP runs well. Critical factors in ERP implementation must get serious attention to project management. Even so, the reality of ERP implementation is slowly, even tends to experience failure, resulting in highly expensive. The previous research that carried out ERP implementation showed that the failure reached 40%, and the achievement of the benefits of ERP implementation in Indonesia is still not optimal. It can be said that ERP implementation is a complexity project. For this reason, it is necessary to consider other implementation methods that can overcome the problem in implementing ERP. An agile method is a proactive and reactive alternative to handle the problem in implementing of ERP. The development of an agile ERP model is one way to achieve success in ERP implementation. This research methodology is a survey approach to the study of literature. This research will propose an agile ERP model which will be used as an effective guide for achieving the success of ERP implementation. © 2019 IEEE.","agile ERP model; agile method; ERP implementation","Information management;

Two online transportation service companies that are still operating and competing are GO-JEK and GRAB. The purpose of this study is understanding the condition of e-marketing, service quality and repurchase intention of Grab and GoJek as online transportation and to determine the effect of e-marketing and service quality on repurchase intentions. The method of collecting data uses a questionnaire distributed to 100 residents of South Jakarta. The data analysis method used in this study is multiple regression analysis using the SPSS application. The sampling technique is probability sampling techniques - simple random sampling. The statistics center of DKI Jakarta Province on January 30, 2017 noted that residents of South Jakarta who had used online transportation services were 2,185,711. Then determining the size and number of samples using Slovin technique sampling with 10% margin error, so that the number of samples to be examined is as much as 99,995 rounded up to 100 samples. Partially, the variable quality of service dominates its influence on repurchase intention variables with t arithmetic 5.201, while t count e-marketing variable is 1.436. T count e-marketing is smaller than t table 1.984. So, it can be concluded that service quality has a significant effect on repurchase intention while e-marketing does not have a significant effect on repurchase intention. © 2019 IEEE.","e-Marketing; repurchase intention; service quality","Commerce; Information management; Marketing; Regression analysis; Data analysis methods; E-marketing; Multiple regression analysis; Probability sampling; Repurchase intention; Service Quality; Simple random sampling; Transportation services; Quality of service",,,,,,"(2017) Traffic Scorecard, , http://inrix.com/scorecard/; Kahraman, C., Yazici, I., Karasan, A., Digital marketing and consumer engagement: Concepts, methodologies, tools, and applications (2018) Hershey: IGI Global; Prasetyo, H.D., Purbawati, D., Pengaruh e-service quality dan e-security seals terhadap e-satisfaction melalui keputusan pembelian konsumen e-commerce (studi kasus pada konsumen lazada Indonesia) (2016) Jurnal Administrasi Bisnis, 5, pp. 127-134; Argote, L., Ingram, P., Knowledge transfer: A basis for competitive advantage in firms (2000) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 82 (1), pp. 150-169; Hutter, K., Hautz, J., Dennhardt, S., Fuller, J., The impact of user interactions in social media on brand awareness and purchase intention: The case of mini on facebook (2013) Journal Product & Brand Management, pp. 342-351; Yoo, C.W., Kim, Y.J., Sanders, G.L., The impact of interactivity of electronic word of mouth systems and e-quality on decision support: In the context of e-marketplace (2015) Information and Management, pp. 1-32; Royle, J., Laing, A., The digital marketing skills gap: Developing a digital marketer model for the communication industries (2014) International Journal of Information Management, pp. 65-73; Al-Weshah, G., E-marketing practices from jordanian tourism agencies perspectives: A qualitative evidence (2018) International Journal of Online Marketing, pp. 21-36; Saghier, N.E., Nathan, D., Service quality dimensions and customers satisfactions of banks in Egypt (2013) Proceedings of 20th International Business Research Conference, pp. 1-13; Pena, M.M., Melleiro, M.M., Batalha, E.M., The use of the quality model of parasuraman, zeithaml and berry in health services (2013) Revista da Escola de Enfermagem da USP, pp. 1227-1232; Al-Tit, A.A., The effect of service and food quality on customer satisfaction and hence customer retention (2015) Asian Social Science, 11, pp. 129-139; Prasetya, F.N., So, I.G., Pengaruh e-marketing dan ecrm terhadap e-loyalty website usaha komunikasi pemasaran (2014) Jurnal Binus Business Review, pp. 8-17; Soebagyo, T., Subagio, H., Analisa pengaruh store image terhadap purchase intention di toserba ramai ngawi (2014) Jurnal Manajemen Pemasaran, 1, pp. 1-9; Ireland, R.D., Hitt, M.A., Sirmon, D.G., A model of strategic entrepreneurship: The construct and its dimensions (2003) Journal of Management, 29 (6), pp. 963-989; Rekettye, G., Rekettye, G., Jr., Global trends and their influence on future business performance (2013) International Journal of Business Performance Management, 14 (1), pp. 95-110",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","4th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2019","19 August 2019 through 20 August 2019",,152147,,9781728133331,,,"English","Proc.

Specifically, IT has made significant and major changes in banking industry, especially on the way people do business with bank. Beside as business enabler, IT now become a major tool for bank to win the competition. With the strategic role of IT in banking industry, there is a risk from security point of view. The new sophisticated and advanced kind of attack drive to higher impact for banks. Beside direct loss caused by successful attack, there is also loss caused by image damage and sanction from regulatory. With many initiatives can be done to improve Information Security condition, banking need to prioritize the initiative that has most significant impact. Management support on information security is cited by many literatures as basic requirement for improving Information Security condition. Security Operation Center also proposed as initiatives to enhance the capability of detection and response to attack. This research tries to empirically find out the impact of Management Support to information security performance and the role of Security Operation Center on mediating both variables. Data are gathered from banks in Indonesia using survey methodology through questionnaire answered by qualified respondents. The sample design used is a probability sample with disproportionate stratified random sampling and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Square. This paper shows that management support has significant impact on improving Information Security condition in banking industry. It also concludes that SOC has complimentary mediation of relationship between management support and information security performance. Practically, result of this research can be foundation for company that wants to focus on factors that significantly impact security performance, while theoretically confirmed previous studies on the role of management support. © BEIESP.","Banking Industry; Information Security Performance; Management Support; Security Operation Center; SEM-PLS",,,,,,,"King, B., (2012) Bank 3.0: Why Banking is No Longer Somewhere You Go but Something You Do, , 1st ed.

However, no studies have tested the effects of the adoption of information technology on the performance of surveyors in performing their duties at the Indonesian Commission for Accreditation of Hospitals (KARS). The purpose of research is to test empirically the external factors that influence the adoption of applications for increased surveyors’ works performance as an assessor of hospitals in Indonesia. External factors studied were: (1) the support of top management, (2) self-efficacy, (3) the quality of the system, and (4) training. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is the best way to evaluate the factors that influence the decision of the assessor and the hospital professionals on the acceptance of a system. Through the distribution of questionnaires were processed using SmartPLS, proving that the four external factors studied had a significant influence on the acceptance of information technology. Based on observations also prove that through the use of Information System of Indonesian Commission for Accreditation of Hospitals or SIKARS application, assessor performance is more effective and efficient. So that, through the data and information provided on the application can support all stakeholders in decision-making.

The aim of this paper was to determine the appropriate topics for a discussion forum for learning management systems through enhanced probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) with the corpus classifier algorithm. In preparing the paper, the methods used were PLSA and the classifying process, which classifies the documents to become a corpus based on the similarity word approach. The similarity word is influenced by the term-frequency of the word in the document. The novel concept in this paper is the corpus classifier algorithm. The experiment was conducted using three approaches to discover the topic, and it used 4,868 distinct words from 234 documents. The documents were contained in three threads subject. The post of the discussion forum is the text document. The performance of the result was measured by the f-measure, which was calculated for each thread subject. The corpus classifier algorithm was used in the second approach, and third approach increased the average f-measure values for the second and third thread subjects by approximately 24 and 17%, respectively. © BEIESP.","Corpus classification; Discussion forum; PLSA; Similarity word; Topic findings",,,,,,,"Chowdhury, A.K., Shanmugan, V., Information Technology: Impacts on Environment and Sustainable (2015) Pertanika J.

It is noted that smoothness and appropriateness of IT operation services influence rework of dissemination of information. This research included 65 online stores in West Kalimantan as the sample. Questionnaires with groups of domains of IT processes and Likert scales were used to collect the data. Managers marketing the products through online stores became the respondents. The research aimed to cognize impacts of maturity levels of IT governance on needs of IT operation services. Results indicate that values of maturity levels that are less than 2.51 are dominated by PO Domain (PO1, PO2, PO3, PO4, PO8, and PO9), AI Domain (AI4 and AI5), DS Domain (DS4 and DS5), and ME Domain (ME4). The lowest value (2.421) is at PO3 (determining IT directions). Meanwhile, the highest one (2.975) is at DS6 (identifying and allocating costs). These values of maturity levels become important indicators of perspectives on IT operation services to map structures, processes, and relationships. Management of IT resources through interrelationships of applications, information, infrastructure, and human resources is inevitably necessary. © 2018 IEEE.","IT Governance; IT Operation Services; Maturity Levels;

Therefore, this article discusses about the research element and research trends on Computer Human Interaction (CHI) research on children with ASD. 117 articles found and 38 articles are selected for reviewed in order to find the research element and term used in CHI Research for children with ASD. 15 of the articles are using qualitative method and 14 are using mix method between qualitative and quantitative. Most of the research participants are the children with ASD. The most favorite development methodology type is the participatory design. Most of the technology are using Software rather than Hardware. © IAEME Publication.","Autism; Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); Computer Human Interaction (CHI); Learning Intervention; Systematic Literature Review (SLR)",,,,,,,"(2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, American Psychiatric Association; Khowaja, K., Salim, S.S., Al-Thani, D., Components to design serious games for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to learn vocabulary (2018) 2018 IEEE 5th International Conference on Engineering Technologies and Applied Sciences (ICETAS), pp. 1-7; (2018) Data & Statistics on Autism Spectrum Disorder, , https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html, Online.

Safety, health, happiness and independence will be difficult for them to get even the elderly will be further away from the surrounding environment. Based on population projection 2017 data there are 23.66 million elderly people in Indonesia and predicted in 2020 there are 27.08 million people elderly. Smart homes that are currently widely studied have not focused on elderly; most smart homes only provide a sense of security and convenience for adult residents. And this will be a problem that until now has not solved the improvement of human life through technology to get happiness, care and health especially for the elderly. In many cases of the elderly, it is easier to send them to live in a nursing home and that keeps them separated from their families for the rest of their lives. That's what makes them less happiness. Orange Technology is a collection of technological elements to improve human life by getting happiness, Care and health. This study reviewed the journals of scientific databases such as IEEE explore, ACM digital library and Proquest published from 2002 to 2017. From the search results obtained 54 papers that will answer the scientific questions of this research. The result of this research is a framework of smart house that has Sensor, Monitoring, Wireless, Scalability, Low cost, GPS and ease of installation and maintenance as components of smart house of orange technology for elderly. © 2018 IEEE.","Components of orange technology; Orange Technology; Smart house for elderly and disabled; smart technology","Automation; Costs; Digital libraries; Health; Houses; Intelligent buildings; Pattern recognition; Population statistics; Elderly people; Home environment; Nursing homes; Orange technologies; Scientific database; Sense of security; Smart technology; Surrounding environment; Citrus fruits",,,,,,"Abascal, J., Bonail, B., Marco, A., Casas, R., Sevillano, J.L., AmbienNet: An intelligent environment to support people with disabilities and elderly people (2008) Proc. 10th Int.

Social media is an Information and Communication Technology product which is a trend of future communication styles, and communication is all about an activity to share the news. The news shared on social media are not always incredible resources, or on the other hand, we can say that most of them are a hoax. According to this condition, research would like to explore what kind of method approach to detect hoax news. This research uses a survey approach to papers published during 2016-2018. By doing this work, we can know the kind of algorithms used for a similar research topic. The most popular approach according to this work is the Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the most used social media platform is Twitter. © 2018 IEEE.","classification; hoax news; social media; Support Vector Machine; twitter","Classification (of information); Pattern recognition; Support vector machines; Surveys; Communication styles; hoax news; Information and Communication Technologies; Research topics; Social media; Social media platforms; twitter; Social networking (online)",,,,,,"Papadopoulos, S., Bontcheva, K., Jaho, E., Lupu, M., Castillo, C., Overview of the special issue on trust and veracity of information in social media (2016) ACM Trans.

Self-diagnostics of teaching can range from personal reflection to formal assessment intended for specific purposes. This paper proposes a novel application of self-diagnostics using fuzzy logic for teaching-learning quality improvement for lecturers, so lecturers recognize the weaknesses and advantages of teaching ability. We use 6 variables as input that consists of openness, clear and understandably, enthusiastic, teaching methods, feedback and commitment for evaluating his performance. The results show that our proposed method is able to evaluate the level of quality of teaching-learning with some suggestions for improvement of the lecturers. Based on the evaluation of exam and quiz after lecturer improves his/her capability in teaching, there is improvement of score 20% for exam and 30% for quiz compared with previous evaluation. © 2019, ICIC International.

In this corridor, the growth of digital content in the system seems to have a positive impact on the organization. However, this continued growth is not always beneficial for the organization over time. In this context, the con- dition is renowned as Information Overload (IO) in the system. The research question in the study is to determine the KMS framework to overcome the information overload issue. As this backdrop, the paper provides the KMS framework guidance to overcome IO issues based on the MapReduce approach. In this respect, this study aims to be a useful reference framework for organizations that address IO problems. The method in this study refers to literature studies which collect various references related to KMS and MapReduce algorithm. It directs to the use of in-depth observation to build the frame- work. Ultimately, this study concludes that the production of KMS MapReduce framework has been completed and set prepared for the implementation in a real case.

The internal threat is predominantly the result of poor employee behavior towards organization’s information security policy. If users do not comply with information security policy, security solutions lose their efficacy. The information security policy serves as a tool to provide direction on how to manage and secure all organizational operations including critical assets, infrastructure, people, and process in organizations. A major challenge for organizations is encouraging employees to comply with information security policy. The objective of this paper is to develop a model for investigating the critical factors that influence employee compliance with information security policy based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Some researchers have extended TAM to include additional factors that influence behavior. In order to develop the model, we conducted a literature review and a discussion with the information security experts from the Government and Higher Education Institutions. The factors that affect employee compliance with organization’s information security policy have been identified. Through this study, we find that the TAM can be used to develop a model for investigating employee compliance with Information Security Policy by extended it with organizational and national cultures. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Employee security behavior; Information security policy; National culture; Organizational culture; Technology acceptance model","Personnel; Security of data; Security systems; Conceptual frameworks; Confidential information; Government institutions; Higher education institutions; Information security policies; National cultures; Organizational cultures; Technology acceptance model; National security",,,,,,"Nugraha, Y., (2015) Ian Brown, , An adaptive wideband delphi method to study state cyber-defence requirements, IEEE, Ashwin Sasongko Sastrosubroto; (2014) Indonesia Government Computer Security Incident Response Team, , security incident report; (2014) Best Practices in Email, , Osterman Research, Inc, Web and Social Media Security; Li, H., Zhang, J., Sarathy, R., (2009) Understanding Compliance with Internet Use Policy from the Perspective of Rational Choice Theory, , Decision Support Systems, Elsevier; van Kessel, P., (2008) Moving beyond compliance—ernt and Young Global Information Security Survey; Al-Omari, A., El-Gayar, O., Deokar, A., Security policy compliance: User acceptance perspective.

In this point, the transaction raises several new and crucial challenges. At a closer look, the concerns appeared due to no data integration, verification, and validation from parties both inside or outside of the university. In this respect, the data is not centralized or integrated. As this backdrop, this causes repeated data confirmation, and no one can authenticate the data validity when distributed to other parties. In this point of entry, the diploma certification forgery has become one of the significant issues in education in Indonesia. As a framework that enables the data integration, Blockchain contains verified data on every single of a transaction, so the data is trustworthy. With this in mind, this paper aims to discuss the best blockchain model for the university level. This study is qualitative-based research. As a result, McRhys model is introduced as a potential and implementable blockchain model in university in Indonesia. © 2019 IADIS Press.

For stockbrokers, understanding trends and forecasting supported by software are very important to decision making and reacting to changes in behavioral patterns. This paper proposes an algorithm and model for market forecasting in Indonesian exchange based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and compared with ARIMA model. We use data from Bank Central Asia (BCA) from 2013-2018 obtained from Yahoo finance. In our experiments, we predict and simulate the important prices called Open, High, Low and Closing (OHLC) with various parameters. Based on the experiment, the best accurate prediction in LSTM comes from the short term (1 year) with high epoch in training phase rather than using 3 years or 5 years of training data, and our model has better result compared with popular model such as ARIMA. These results should be very useful to be used in stock exchange office. © 2018, ICIC International.

Based on this fact, many organizations take an opportunity to utilize social media as an additional channel to engage with their stakeholders. Social learning is one of the implementations of social media technology in higher education institution to collaborate with teaching and learning strategies. Many higher education institutions decide to involve social learning concept into their teaching and learning process because of the shifting generation of student, which most students today use social media to interact with each other. Based on this phenomenon, this study tried to compare the different impacts between e-learning as in condition and social learning system into learning outcome. In this study, authors divided two groups to test the linkages under different situations (social learning and e-learning systems) using sampling groups to draw the impact of these systems. This study is addressed to identify the influence of different channel learning media and to assess the influence into several output variables, which are participation, performance, and engagement.

Systematic Literature Review (SLR) used as a method in this study and there were five databases that taken as references, such as IEEE, Science direct, AIS electronic, ACM and Google Scholar. The researchers were found 26 references Studies Included in Quantitative Synthesis and 9 variables (Easy to use, Usefulness, Transaction fees, Risk perception, Behaviour intention of use, Attitude toward, Cognitive style, Subjective Norm, Effectiveness). Based on the result of data analysis and discussion, there were two conclusions in this study, the first, the researchers found nine factors that expected tobe used as a reference if Indonesia banking industry wants to adopt blockchain technology for payment system; and second, the researchers had to propose payment system model by using blockchain technology in Indonesia banking industry. © 2018 IEEE.","adoption; affecting; banking industry; blockchain; payment systems; Systematic Literature Review (SLR)","Binary alloys; Information management; Potassium alloys; Risk perception; Uranium alloys; adoption; affecting; Banking industry; Payment systems; Systematic literature review (SLR); Blockchain",,,,,,"Yoo, S., Blockchain based financial case analysis and its implications (2017) Asia Pacific Journal of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, 11 (3), pp. 312-321; Schaupp, L.C., Festa, M., Cryptocurrency adoption and the road to regulation (2018) Association for Computing Machinery, , ACM ISBN 978-1-4503.

Therefore, ERP system is important strategy for organization's survival. One of the critical issues that affect a successful ERP implementation is the implementation method. In previous research, it showed that many organizations had faced complexity when they were implementing ERP in order to meet their requirements. In other cases, the ERP systems are unable to provide solution which is a simplicity of the necessary business processes. The ERP implementation complexity is one of the factors that lead the failures. Thus, here, we intend to propose an agile approach to reduce complexity and eventually our intention is to improve ERP implementing to become more successful. In this study, we are employing a systematic literature review (SLR) approach to identify the principles factors of the agile methods for ERP implementation. In result of employing this SLR method, we found that agile values and principles are correlated in ERP implementation complexity. © 2018 IEEE.","agile methods; complexity; ERP implementation; systematic literature review","Agile manufacturing systems; Information management; Agile approaches; Agile methods; Business environments; Business Process; complexity; ERP implementation; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Enterprise resource planning",,,,,,"Alleman, G.B., Agile project management methods for ERP: How to apply agile processes to complex COTS projects and live to tell about it (2002) Conference on Extreme Programming and Agile Methods, , Springer; Amid, A., Moalagh, M., Ravasan, A.Z., (2012) Identification and classification of ERP critical failure factors in Iranian industries; Ali, M., Miller, L., Erp system implementation in large enterprises-A systematic literature review (2017) Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 30, p. 4; Baig, J.J.A., Shah, A., Sajjad, F., Evaluation of agile methods for quality assurance and quality control in ERP implementation (2017) Intelligent Computing and Information Systems (ICICIS), 2017 Eighth International Conference on, pp. 252-257. , IEEE; Bansal, V., Negi, T., A metric for ERP complexity (2008) International Conference on Business Information Systems, pp. 369-379. , Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg; Baramichai, M., Zimmers, E.W., Jr., Marangos, C.A., Agile supply chain transformation matrix: An integrated tool for creating an agile enterprise.

The alignment is done to support IT achievement of organizational business goals. The purpose of this study is to determine the factors that influence to the achievement of alignment between business-IT in the organization. To search for IT-business alignment factors, a review literature was conducted and produced eighteen selected papers. From the literature review conducted on eighteen selected papers, there were twenty factors identified as alignment factors. Furthermore, these factors are categorized into two perspectives of alignment factors that are business perspective and IT perspective. Once classified then there are only 5 alignment business-IT factors: Business Process, Methodology, Modeling, Technology that support the application, and Network Collaboration. © 2017 IEEE.","Alignment Factors; Business-IT; EA; Systemic Literature Review","Information management; Business perspective; Business Process; Business-IT; Enterprise Architecture; IT-business alignments; Literature reviews; Network collaboration; Systematic literature review; Network architecture",,,,,,"Lovelock, J., Atwal, R., Blackmore, D., Bianca, G., Hahn, W., Hardcastle, J., IT spending forecast, 2Q15 update: Why is global IT spending shrinking?

This brings a successfully decreasing in the amount of baggage mishandling. SITA 2017 reported that during 10 years until 2016 there is increasing of airline passengers, but decreasing in the amount of mishandled baggage. Many people believe that this great achievement was caused by IT implementation in baggage handling system in airport, including the massive use of RFID for baggage identification tool. Indonesia as one of the countries with the largest population had a significant increasing amount of air passengers and their baggage, that is 15% from 2015 to 2016. Until now this huge number of air baggage is stil manually handled, so Indonesia is facing a serious problem of handling the huge amount of baggage that keep growing.

Community colleges and schools seek to complement the traditional teaching system with e-learning systems. However, we found there are differences in individual learning styles in terms of speed and learning styles. Serving or teaching students with one mechanism of the same teaching method will ignore individual rights while reducing the meaning of education broadly from the humanity dimension. Such situations will affect the target of increasing competence, the growth of knowledge and the value expected for some individuals to fail. The electronic learning model then undergoes a shift away from a mere system, now evolving into a personalized learning model, where learning processes are oriented toward the students' abilities. Under these conditions, models and other techniques are needed to help personalized adaptive learning as they need it. The purpose of this study was to identify the general criteria of personalized electronic learning model to meet the needs, interests and objectives of the learner in a more personal sense in a broader sense. This research was conducted through literature study on papers published in the last five years (2012-2017).

For public sector, ITG implementation is difficult because it is complex than ITG in the private sector. It is therefore necessary to have ITG mechanisms that align public sector needs especially in creating public value. The literature in ITG implementation in the public sector still does not discuss the ITG mechanisms implementation that align with IT strategy to create public value. Using Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we find key practices in ITG mechanisms that align with IT strategy in the public sector. These key practices are the basis of the conceptual model of the relationship between IT G mechanisms, strategic IT alignment, and effective public value. © 2017 IEEE.","IT Governance Mechanisms; Public Value; Strategic IT Alignment","Conceptual model; Information technology governance; IT alignment; IT governance; IT strategies; Private sectors; Public values; Systematic literature review (SLR); Information management",,,,,,"Ross, J.W., Sebastian, I.M., Beath, C., Scantlebury, S., Mocker, M., Fonstad, N., (2016) Designing Digital Organizations; Weil, P., Ross, J.W., (2004) IT Governance: How Top Performers Manage IT Decision Rights for Superior Results; Peterson, R., Crafting information technology governance (2004) Inf.

One of the difficulties is to transform algorithm in mind into syntactical solution (sourcecode). This study proposes an application to help students in transform their algorithm (logic) into sourcecode. The proposed application can be used to write down students' algorithm (logic) as block of pseudocode and then transform it into selected programming language sourcecode. Students can learn and modify the sourcecode and then try to execute it (learning by doing).

To prevent high non-passing rate, instructor needs to know which learner has the potential to pass the course or not. Learner who will fail the course also need advices immediately from instructor or system to overcome it. Learning Analytics (LA) is needed to collect and analyze learners' activity logs on MOOC and predict their passing potential. The prototype application is developed by using Rational Unified Process (RUP) software development method. Implementation of LA in MOOC is feasible and suggested to analyze learners' success factors by consuming learners' activity logs and visualizing it in scatter diagram and node-link diagram. Instructor can provide advices to learners based on success factors generated by LA. © 2018 Budi Yulianto, Harjanto Prabowo, Raymond Kosala and Manik Hapsara.","Learner success factor; Learning analytics; MOOC",,,,,"Binus University

However, there are numerous difficulties in maintaining a reliable KM system. One of the challenges is to manage knowledge materials in video format. A video file contains complex data that lead to the difficulties in managing them. Without an intelligent system, managing videos for KM requires a laborious effort. In this paper, an intelligent framework for KM system, embedded with deep learning model, is proposed. The use of the deep learning model alleviates the heavy burden of video materials management in KM system.

This condition reveals that there has been no synchronization and interoperability of producing information for the need of processing the academic data. The problem of the research proposal was formulated to (a) produce a new research model regarding influences of IT innovation adoption and IT governance on IT service management in improving information performance of schools; (b) create a hypothetical testing design to cognize influences of every variable in this research. The research aim was to analyze the magnitude of relationships and influences of IT service management based upon supports and deliveries of information services becoming dominant factors improving information performance of schools. The research was designed with an explanatory survey of analyzed units of organizations. Furthermore, the research applied a mixed (quantitative and qualitative) method and concurrent triangulation strategy. Computed quantitative data were obtained from a sample of 55 schools determined through a simple random sampling technique. Strengthening the quantitative analysis, qualitative measurement was conducted through in-depth interviews and FGDs (Focus Group Discussions) with 5 informants in the sample. © 2017 IEEE.","Information Performance;

MOOC (Massive Open Online Course), a web-based LMS providing online courses, is a new popular learning media expected to facilitate better teaching-learning process for improving learning outcomes. Unfortunately, most of the current MOOCs are intended only for non-vocational (non-practical) learning and have set aside research on MOOC for computer programming courses. This study employed systematic literature review (SLR) method to summarize and review available functionalities as the core in designing a proposed MOOC architecture model. The proposed model covers application layers (user, system, and data layers) and adopts the theories of cognitive, constructive, and social situated learning. The proposed model is expected to provide guidance for institutions to develop their own MOOC and utilize it in blended learning processes to improve the outcome in computer programming courses. © 2016 IEEE.","architecture model; blended learning; learning outcome; massive open online course; MOOC; programming","Computer architecture; Computer programming; Curricula; Education; Information management; Mathematical programming; Teaching; Architecture modeling; Blended learning; Learning outcome; Massive open online course; MOOC; E-learning",,,,,,"Ibrahim, R., Jaafar, A., Using educational games in learning introductory programming: A pilot study on students' perceptions (2010) 2010 Int.

From many perspectives particularly for educational, it is interesting to examine how social media can contribute to the learning process. This channel can support an interactive process that occurs when a group of learners collaborates with other to combine their knowledge into new insights. This research focuses on identifying social learning factors framework that enable higher education to be sustainable and be more adaptive. It also depicts conceptual social learning ontology according to Zachman Framework for enhancing collaboration and increasing responsiveness by leveraging social media channel in higher education. The objective of this study is to support classification scheme for descriptive representations of the social learning model. That is not only doing the design artifacts, but it depicts all supportive components to the organizational perspective. This set of view appears to be universal of the subject or object being described, including what (data), how (function), where (network), who (people), when (time), and why (motivation). The primary method of this study is systematic literature review process to define social learning factors that can be mapped into Zachman Framework. The result of this research is conceptual of ontology model for social learning that can be implemented for higher education. © 2016 IEEE.","Ontology; Social learning; Web 2.0; Zachman Framework","Information management; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Classification scheme; Interactive process; Learning process; Organizational perspectives; Social learning; Systematic literature review; Web 2.0; Zachman framework; Ontology",,,,,,"Elkaseh, A.M., Wong, K.W., Fung, C.C., Perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of social media for e-learning in libyan higher education: A structural equation modeling analysis (2015) Int.

The study of Knowledge Management System (KMS) issues are based on Systematic Literature Review (SLR). It aims to analyze the state of the art, identify current popular issues on KMS, and offer directions for future research agenda. The methodology used in this paper is based on the systematic literature review to collect, synthesize and analyze numerous papers on a variety of topics that are closely related to knowledge management system issues that published in the last two decades. Based on fifty-four papers reviewed from six electronic databases, the result of this paper obtained fourteen current issues on knowledge management system. Moreover, the top three popular issues consist of the development of capabilities and features of KMS, Big Data issues on KMS, and adoption to new technology issue for KMS respectively. The conclusion of this study emphasized the big data phenomenon as the most contemporary topic for the future research area besides the growing of required KMS capabilities and features development. © 2017 The Authors.

This study goal is to design a tool to support novice programmers' early learning of programming before they step into coding, compiling, running, and debugging in WIDE. Software development method used in this study is Rational Unified Process (RUP). Conclusion of this study is block-code tool can help novice programmers to learn programming language in early phase, and motivate them better. © 2017 The Authors.

Studies show that TBL can provide opportunities in developing teamwork capabilities and enhancing active learning, which are effects that could remedy the weaknesses of implementing blended learning. A blended teaching portfolio was developed for an International Human Resource Management course that consisted of a course overview, graduate competency, a syllabus, course material resources, a teaching scenario, a reading assurance test, midterm/final exams, student assignments, assessment of learning outcomes, and a course quality improvement sheet. Each item was constructed based on the characteristics of the course. The portfolio was considered a valuable tool for lecturers to manage a blended-learning course that can help students in achieving higher scores and in motivating them to read course materials prior to class sessions.","E-learning; Face to Face; In Person; Learning Management System; Online Learning; Readiness Assurance Process; Syllabus; Team Based Learning",,,,,,,"Alebaikan, R., Troudi, S., Blended learning in Saudi universities: Challenges and perspectives (2010) ALT-J.

The tremendous exposure of social media today has changed a new communication channel for all business process. Although it is for better support or worse, social media is very powerful because many organizations begin to initiate strategies and allocate resources to engage effectively with social media platform. Higher education as organizational learning is expected to concern with this situation because the orientation of education today exposed to students centered learning mechanism to provide them with a holistic learning experience. Social media was realized as an innovative and effective tool to provide innovative ways of involving and motivating students in the learning process. Therefore, there is a need to investigate how students perceive and use social media in providing a pedagogically virtual learning environment that could enhance their learning experience. To achieve the goals of infusing social media into traditional pedagogical approach, the research investigates the preferences channel of social media for collaborative learning in the context of higher education as educational platform. A descriptive survey method used in this evaluation to show the trend in higher education. The result clearly describes social media preferences in the community of higher education so that learners can be actively engaged with learning process and flexible environments for global communication sharing. © 2016 IEEE.","Higher education; preferences; social learning; Social media","Computer aided instruction; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Students; Surveys; Collaborative learning; Descriptive survey method; Higher education; Organizational learning; preferences; Social learning; Social media; Virtual learning environments; Education",,,,,,"Chitiba, C.A., Lifelong learning challenges and opportunities for traditional universities (2012) Procedia-Soc.

Higher education as a place to educate and share knowledge has to realize these phenomena. With social media, organization supports the knowledge sharing process within organization. Then it changes learning mechanism from e-learning into social learning environment. According to this fact, this research will combine the concepts of knowledge management and social learning as a model framework's component by identifying the significant factors and its relationship with social media. A systematic and relevant literature review from journals and textbooks was conducted to support the development of component framework model. As the result, we propose an integrated model of knowledge management with social learning for higher education. © 2016 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.","E-learning; Higher education; Knowledge management;

The lemma and sub lemma of Indonesian Language have been grown and absorb from foreign languages or Indonesian traditional languages. Our approach provides the easy way of stemming Indonesian language through flexibility affix classification. Therefore, the affix additional can be applied in easy way. We experiment with 1,704 text documents with 255,182 tokens and the stemmed words is 3,648 words. In this experiment, we compare our approach performance to the confix-stripping approach performance.

Citizens' participation believed to bring value to various system development projects. However, the existing research has shown that introducing user participation (in this case is citizen participation) to public e-service development can be challenging. The study literature review aims to investigate factors that influence citizens' willingness and ability to participate in public e-service development according to three user participation theories: User-centered Design, Participatory Design and User Innovation.

In fact, it is not easy to successfully implement this strategy because it requires a huge investment and is influenced by complexity algorithms, training, and testing. The frauds bring fatal impact, such as destruction of the banking reputation, banking loss, and state financial loss. One target of the fraud perpetrators in banking is online banking transactions. Security has become a major issue in the online banking transaction. Furthermore, the research of fraud is switching to big data and turns out that online banking data are stored in the database operational and big data. This study aims to find out what kind of algorithms fraud detection for online banking transactions using a systematic literature review to the 25 relevant papers.","Algorithm; Big data; Fraud; Fraud detection system; Online banking transaction",,,,,,,"Khande, R., (2014) Attacks and Preventive Measures to Minimize Risk, ICICES, 2014 (978). , Online Banking in India; Maruatona, O.O., Vamplew, P., Dazeley, R., Prudent fraud detection in internet banking (2012) Third Cybercrime Trust.

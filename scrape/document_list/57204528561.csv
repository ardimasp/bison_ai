Analysis of the process was done to determine business processes run on the main division. Analysis applied 7 first steps method defined by Tiwana in doing KMS application prototype. Data were obtained by observation, interviews with the division head, and distributing questioners that concerned with organizational culture, components of KM analysis, and prototype design evaluation. It can be concluded that the design of KMS prototype produces five modules such as, Document Library, Blog, Discussion Forum, Knowledge Base, and Helpdesk. The result of prototype evaluation indicates the value gains 37.14, it shows effective value that is above average, therefore, the design of the prototype KMS application has been able to meet for 74.29% of the purpose and benefits of the prototype. The prototype of KMS application needs a continuous improvement coordinated by the company's managers. © 2016 IEEE.","kknowledge management; KM development; KM prototype; Knowledge Management sSystem","Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Continuous improvements; KM development; KM prototype; Knowledge management system; Knowledge sharing cultures; Organizational cultures; Prototype designs; S-systems; Software prototyping",,,,,"Coughlan, P., Suri, J.F., Canales, K., Prototypes as (design).

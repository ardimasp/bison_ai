The study proposes a model that shows the effect of skincare marketing strategies through social media for male millennials generations. A quantitative approach is used to collect the data to support the model using online surveys. The data samples are collected from 203 male respondents using non-probability sampling techniques with convenience sampling method. The results are analysed with PLS-SEM methodologies by Smart- PLS, considered to be applied when the research is exploratory. The research result shows that social media marketing had a significant impact on brand image and brand trust. Moreover, brand trust and brand image had significant impacts on purchase intention. With brand image and brand trust 56.1 percent explained the purchase intention, 53.6 percent social media marketing explained the brand image, and 65.4 percent of the social media marketing explained the brand trust as well. © 2020 by the authors;

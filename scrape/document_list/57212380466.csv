This research examines gamification in Shoppee, one of the biggest e-commerce sites in Indonesia. Based on survey data, this study examines the effect of gamification on different generations (generation X versus Millennials). The study uses a quantitative approach using SEM (Structure Equation Model) with Smart PLS to analyze the data. The result shows that there is a significantly different effect on both generations. Generation X show that perceived usefulness and recognition are an essential aspect of gamification. While for millennials, they show that playfulness and social influence are important factors. © 2020 IEEE.","E-commerce; Gamification; Generation","Electronic commerce; Information management; Different effects; E-commerce sites; Game elements; Perceived usefulness; Quantitative approach; Social influence; Structure equation models; Survey data; Gamification",,,,,"Koivisto, J., Hamari, J., The rise of motivational information systems: A review of gamification research (2019) Int.

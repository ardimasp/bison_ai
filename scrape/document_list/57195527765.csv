It is not only detrimental to the state, but also harm the perpetrators of theft of electricity and the surrounding communities. The purpose of this study is to create New Service Development (NSD) to provide a new electricity source for street vendors' activity based on their preferences. The methods applied in NSD is Conjoint Analysis, Cluster Analysis, Quality Function Deployment (QFD), Service Blueprint, Process Flow Diagrams and Quality Control Plan. The results of this study are the attributes and their importance in the new electricity's service based on street vendors' preferences as customers, customer segmentation, service design for new service, designing technical response, designing operational procedures, the quality control plan of any existing operational procedures. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cluster analysis; Crime; Electric utilities; Quality function deployment; Statistical methods; Customer segmentation; Electricity distribution; Electricity source; New service development; Operational procedures; Process flow diagrams; Quality function deployments (QFD); Service blueprint; Quality control",,,,,"Achilleas, B., Kostas, K., Exploring the Fuzzy Front-end of the New Service Development Process - A Conceptual Framework (2014) Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 148, pp. 348-353; Claret, Anna, Guerrero, Luis, Aguirre, Enaitz, Rincón, Carmen, Consumer preferences for sea fish using conjoint analysis: Exploratory study of the importance of country of origin, obtaining method, storage conditions and purchasing price (2012) Food Quality and Preference, 26, pp. 259-266; Jack, C., Lemuria, C., Social Media and Humanitarian Logistics: The Impact of Task-technology Fit on New Service Development (2015) Procedia Engineering, 107, pp. 412-416; Fitzsimmons, J.A., Fitzsimmons, M.J., (2006) Service Management Operation, Strategy, Information Technology, , (New York: McGraw-Hill); Spiros, G., Kalliopi, C., Achilleas, B., Helen, P., Unfolding the recipes for conflict resolution during the new service development effort (2016) Journal of Business Research, 69, pp. 4042-4055; Dieter, H., Saed, I., Van Husen Christian, Carsten, D., A New Approach for the Development of Services for Industrial Product-Service Systems (2016) Procedia CIRP, 47, pp. 353-357; Kim, K.J., Meiren, T., (2010) New Service Development Process, pp. 253-267. , Kim K.

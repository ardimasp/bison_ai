The data used is the data of student learning transactions in 2016 and 2017 as many as 16000. There are 4 assessment indicators of distance learning student learning outcomes, namely Forum discussion (FOD), Personal assignment (PAS), TAS and Quiz (QIZ). The technique is then discussed in terms of prediction accuracy, using machine learning with the Naïve Bayes algorithm with the Rapid Miner application. The results state that student activity in the FOD discussion forum is the biggest indicator that influences student learning outcomes. With performance vector result accuracy of 84.03%. With an active group discussion forum with diverse backgrounds and student characteristics, most of which are workers showing activities, the discussion forum provides knowledge sharing between students and lecturers in the learning process to be both very good and important. © 2019 IEEE.","distance learning; Machine learning; Naïve bayes; online learning; recommender system","Distance education; Engineering education; Forecasting; Machine learning; Assessment indicator; Group discussions; Knowledge-sharing; Learning achievement; Performance vectors; Prediction accuracy; Student characteristics; Student learning outcomes; Students",,,,,"Kaewkiriya, T., Utakrit, N., Tiantong, M., The design of a rule base for an e-learning recommendation system base on multiple intelligences (2015) Int.

We applied 2 methods, one for classifying the conversation type and the other for calculating the online grooming percentage. We used neural network to classify the conversation into several classes. As for calculating the percentage, we used analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to find grooming score based on priority score for each class. This research focused more on online conversation that consists of two people and used English as the main language. The results can be used to determine whether the conversation is considered as groom or not. © 2019 ICIC International.","Analytic hierarchy process; Neural network; Online child grooming; Online conversation; Priority score",,,,,,,"Randhawa, T., Jacobs, S., (2013) Child Grooming: ‘Offending All the Way through from the Start’ – Exploring the Call from Law Reform, , Australia: Child Wise; Saaty, T.L., Decision making with the analytic hierarchy process (2008) Int.

There are two basic objectives for the use, which are first to facilitate and deepen the basic knowledge of polynom spline art principles by understanding the correct use of the polynom spline art formula. The second mastery of this theme is the need to produce a graphical system, which is based on the polynom spline art formula. The use of polynom spline art is a large number in the field of construction of object graphs. This Research takes into account the node K of the B-spline blending function. The method used is based on the polynom spline-art theory. The results to be achieved, namely the model of making objects based on polynom spline Art. In this research using programming language to describe and achieve the goal, that is graph by using simple openGL and make in general and can recordthe structure of good data. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Graphical system; OpenGL; Polynom spline art","Application programming interfaces (API); Blending; Electronic commerce; Graph theory; Blending function; Construction technique; Design modeling; Graphical system; Object graphs; OpenGL; Polynom spline art; Smooth curves; Interpolation",,,,,"Appreciation to the Ministry of Research Technology and Higher Education of Republic of Indonesia, which has provided support to the author through 2018 Research Grants.","Newman, W.M., Sproull, R.F., (1981) Principles of Interactive Computer Graphics, , Kogakusha, McGraw-Hill; David, F., Rogers, Adams, J.A., (1998) Mathematical Elements for Computer Graphics, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Pavlidis, T., (1997) Algorithms for Graphics and Image; Giloi, W.K., (1999) Interactive Computer Graphics, , Prentice Hall, Inc.

This task is intended to analyze the presence of a support relation between two sentences. To be able to identify relations between two sentences or arguments, one is obliged to understand the nuance brought by both sentences. Our models are modification of siamese network architectures, in which we replace the feature extractor into Long Short Term Memory and implement cosine distance as the energy function. Our models take a pair of sentences as their input and try to identify whether there is a support relation between those two sentences or not.The primary motivation of this research is to prove that a high degree of similarity between two sentences correlates to sentences supporting each other. This work will focus more on the modification of siamese network and the implementation of attention mechanism. Due to the difference in dataset setting, we cannot arbitrarily compare our results with the prior research results. Therefore, this work will not highlight the comparison between deep learning and traditional machine learning algorithm per se, but it will be more of an exploratory research. Our models are able to outperform the baseline score of accuracy with a margin of 17.33% (67.33%). By surpassing the baseline performance, we believe that our work can be a stepping stone for deep learning implementation in argumentation mining field. © 2017 The Authors.

Here, we will study the effect of Bragg scattering mechanism to the potential velocity. Assume that the water is incompressible and irrolational, and also satisfying linear equation as governing equation. We apply the multiple scale expansion to solve the boundary value problem analytically. Reflection coefficient as a solution shows that Bragg resonance gives the signflcant effect to the potential velocity. We found that a larger amplitude disturbance leads to larger reflected wave amplitude. This result explains that the sinusoidal beds can reduce the amplitude of incident wave.

In this paper, we study the relevance of sinusoidal beds as shoreline protection through the Bragg scattering mechanism. As well known, a relatively small amplitude of sinusoidal beds can reduce the amplitude of incident waves effectivelly, due to Bragg resonance. Bragg resonance will occur if the wavelength of the monochromatic wave is twice the wavelength of sinusoidal beds. We apply the multiple scale asymptotic expansion method to the linear Shallow initial value problem for sinusoidal beds. the effect of Bragg resonance pass through sinusoidal beds has been studied for surface displacement of water waves. We found that a larger amplitude disturbance leads to larger reflected wave amplitude. This result explains that the long shore sandbar indeed can reduce the amplitude of incident wave. Actually, wave's propagation not only derives from surface displacement, but also from potential velocity. At the end, we show that the sinusoidal beds can reduce the potential velocity of incident wave. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Bragg Resonance; potential velocity; sinusoidal beds","Artificial intelligence; Crack propagation; Initial value problems; Resonance; Surface measurement; Velocity; Wave transmission; Amplitude disturbances; Asymptotic expansion method; Bottom undulation; Bragg resonance; Monochromatic wave; Shoreline protection; sinusoidal beds; Surface displacement; Water waves",,,,,,"Pudjaprasetya, S.R., Chendra, H.D., An Optimal Dimension of Submerged Parallel Bars as a Wave Reflector Bull.

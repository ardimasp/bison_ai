However, this test is a dry test and does not assess the performance of aggregates when they are wet. In tropical countries, including Indonesia, moisture on aggregates is an important issue as it might introduce problems to the pavement layers during and after the construction process. This research aims to investigate the capability of the LA Abrasion test to assess the moisture susceptibility of aggregates by altering the test procedure. In this research, the LA Abrasion test procedure was modified to test wet aggregates and the results were compared to the original LA Abrasion test. There are three different types of aggregates were tested herein, namely igneous, sedimentary, and coral aggregates. Additionally, the various percentage of clay was also added to cover the aggregates. From the preliminary results, it was found that the LA Abrasion test can be modified to detect the moisture susceptibility of aggregates. Different aggregates have different water absorption levels, and hence, affect the final result (percentage of material loss). Adding clay to the aggregates also affected the results. © 2017 Author(s).",,,,,,,"Nataadmadja, A.D., Setyandito, O., Basrian, F.M., Kurniawardhani, M.G., The study of the usage of coral and limestone aggregates as asphaltic layer on coastal structures (2017) MATEC Web of Conferences; Smith, M.R., Collis, L., Aggregates: Sand, gravel and crushed rock aggregates for construction purposes (2001) The Geological Society; Hosking, J.R., (1970) Synthetic Aggregates of High Resistance to Polishing Part 1 - Gritty Aggregates; Hartley, A., (1974) J.

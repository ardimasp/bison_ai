Nowadays, schools are relying on Management Information System (MIS) to handle operations. In this paper we propose to design SMIS architecture capable of serve multiple schools by using Representational State Transfer (REST) as architectural style. Case study, REST constraint and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) design pattern is being used to design the architecture. From the design process, multitenant architecture is chosen. Kubernetes is chosen as deployment orchestration to make architecture scalable. Then we examine and evaluate engineering trade-off and risks in architectures design decision by using Architecture Trade-off Analysis Method (ATAM). The evaluation is based on scenarios and each scenario related to several software quality attributes. At the end, the architecture implementation is improved overtime based on the evaluation result. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Each of them is unique in every school and cannot be generalized although using the same curriculum. School personnel such as headmaster, teacher, and staff also not only assigned to one school location and can have multiple roles in each school location. With that complexity, a single query is not fast enough to generate a scoring report. This paper proposed the system business intelligence which can analyze the progress of student learning. This paper used nine steps to design a data warehouse as a tool business intelligence. The On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP) is used to analyze the data and visualize them using dashboard. By using data warehouse, each school can answer business question relation to scoring and visualize them in a dashboard to make a decision. © 2019 IEEE.","Business Intelligence; Data Warehouse; Report; Scoring; Socrates System School","Curricula; Data warehouses; Education management; On-line analytical processing; School location; Student learning; Information analysis",,,,,"Tarnaveanu, D., Pentaho business analytics: A business intelligence open source alternative (2012) ERP and E-Business Application Deployment in Open Source Distributed Cloud Systems; He, Y., Lee, R., Huai, Y., Shao, Z., Jain, N., Zhang, X., Xu, Z., Rcfile: A fast and space-efficient data placement structure in mapreduce-based warehouse systems (2011) Data Engineering (ICDE), 27th International Conference on, pp. 1199-1208; Tuncer, O., Van Den Berg, J., (2010) Implementing BI concepts with Pentaho, an evaluation, , Delft University of Technology.

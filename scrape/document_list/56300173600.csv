The study examines various literatures in NFC technology and implementation, including standard bodies' white papers, case studies on pilot projects around the world, patents, recent articles, journals and supplementary books. Comparing to other alternatives of mobile payment, the proximity mobile payment using NFC technology clearly has an advantage. Not only it is fast, secure, and intuitive, the implementation of NFC opens up a new world of opportunities to be used for other value-adding purposes aside from proximity mobile payment services. The benefits and potential growth in Indonesia supports business cause for investing in this breakthrough payment service. Proposed mechanism is also in place.","Business model; Mobile payment; Near field communications","Knowledge management; Mobile telecommunication systems; Business modeling; Mobile payment; Near field communications; Nfc technologies; Payment services; Potential growth; Provide guidances; Standard bodies; Global system for mobile communications",,,,,"Pertumbuhan Selular (2008), http://tikometer.or.id/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=38&Itemid=46, Pusat Teknologi Informasi dan Komunikasi Badan Pengkajian dan Penerapan Teknologi, [Online], [Retrieved February 22. 2008, 2009 Aug 24]; Peraturan Bank Indonesia No.11/12/PBI/2009-Uang Elektronik (Electronic Money) (2009), http://www.bi.go.id/web/id/Peraturan/Sistem+Pembayaran/pbi_111209.htm, Bank Indonesia [Online], [Retrieved 2009 Dec 26]; Perkembangan Sistem Pembayaran di Indonesia (2008), http://www.bi.go.id/web/id/Sistem+Pembayaran/Sistem+Pembayaran+di+Indonesia/Perkembangan/, Bank Indonesia [Online], [Retrieved 2009 Dec 23]; Ortiz, C.E., An Introduction to Near-Field Communication and the Contactless Communication API (2008), http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/javame/nfc/, Sun Developer Network [Online], [Retrieved 2009 Oct 30]; Balaban, D., NFC Payment: Can Operators and Banks Work Together?

In this research, we would like to propose an Intelligent Humanoid Robot with the self-learning capability for accepting and giving responses from people based on Deep Learning and Big Data knowledge base. This kind of robot can be used widely in hotels, universities, and public services. The Humanoid Robot should consider the style of questions and conclude the answer through conversation between robot and user. In our scenario, the robot will detect the user’s face and accept commands from the user to do an action. Findings: The question from the user will be processed using deep learning, and the result will be compared to the knowledge base on the system. We proposed our Deep Learning approach, based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder, Convolution Neural Network (CNN) encoder, with Bidirectional Attention Flow (BiDAF). Conclusions: Our evaluation indicates that using RNN based encoder with BiDAF gives a higher score, than CNN encoder with the BiDAF. Based on our experiment, our model get 82.43% F1 score and the RNN based encoder will give a higher EM/F1 score than using the CNN encoder. © 2020, The Author(s).","Big data; Deep learning; Humanoid Robot; NLP",,,,,"Binus University: 12/AKM/PNT/2019

According to World Bank data, Indonesia is the country with the largest economic development in Southeast Asia. Unfortunately, the threat of terrorism in Indonesia is very large, therefore it requires a smart system such as military robots. Today's vision-based robot technology has also been used in the development of autonomous military robots. A sophisticated military robot is a robot that is needed by the military/police because it can be deployed to the battlefield or the eradication of terrorism in a remote or autonomous manner. This system is needed to reduce the remaining casualties from the army, and this combat robot system can also be operated at any time with more numbers than regular soldiers and with minimal operator needs. In this paper, we propose a prototype of a tank-based military robot with object detection and tracking and turrets for simulation of shooting the enemy target based on the computer vision. The object tracker will detect an upper body of the target using a library in OpenCV and the tank will track until it reaches the best position to shoot the target. The methods explained, and experimental results were presented. © 2019 IEEE.","computer vision; military robot; object detction; object tracker; turret","Economics; Intelligent robots; Object detection; Tanks (containers); Target tracking; Terrorism; Economic development; Military robots; Object detction; Object detection and tracking; object tracker; Robot technology; Southeast Asia; turret; Computer vision",,,,"Binus University

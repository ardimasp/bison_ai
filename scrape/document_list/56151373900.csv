The new algorithm used emphasizes dictionary learning process in which it can reduce the noise at 0.05% low which almost equal to ordinary K-SVD algorithm. Moreover, EKSVD was able to reduce the time process for denoising for 40% faster than the ordinary K-SVD algorithm. © 2013 IIJ.","Dictionary learning; Enhanced K-SVD algorithm; Image denoising; K-SVD algorithm; Optimum",,,,,,"Aharon, M., (2006) Overcomplete Dictionaries for Sparse Representation of Signals, , Ph.D. dissertation, Dept. of Computer Science, Israel Institute of Technology; Elad, M., Aharon, M., Image Denoising via Sparse, and Redundant Representations Over Learned Dictionaries (2006) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 15 (12), pp. 3736-3745. , Dec; Elad, M., Aharon, M., Image Denoising via Learned Dictionaries, and Sparse Representation (2006) IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision, and Pattern Recognition, 1, pp. 895-900; Aharon, M., Elad, M., Bruckstein, A.M., On the Uniqueness of Overcomplete Dictionaries,, and a Practical Way to Retrieve them (2006) Linear Algebra, and Its Applications, 416 (1), pp. 48-67. , July; Aharon, M., Elad, M., Bruckstein, A.M., K-SVD, and its Non-Negative Variant for Dictionary Design (2005) Proc.

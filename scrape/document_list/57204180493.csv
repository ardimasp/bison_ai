The research on developing a Chinese grammar checking website is aimed at helping Mandarin learners in mastering Mandarin grammar. This website can be a ""learning companion"" of basic-level Mandarin learners outside the classroom. This technology is still very new, so this research should be carried out immediately by researchers in Indonesia to master this technology. The method used in this research is a quantitative approach. The collection of grammar patterns that will appear on the chineseteak.net will be selected from several Chinese textbooks. Then the pattern will become Mandarin grammar patterns and will be entered the website auto-correct grammar. This website is designed using PHP and MySQL as the database. From the results of the questionnaire, we can find out that there are 7 points of Mandarin grammar that are still difficult for early learners. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Natural language processing systems; Websites; Grammar checkers; Indonesia; Learning companions; NAtural language processing; Quantitative approach; Engineering education",,,,"Binus University: 033/VR, BNS2019-184, RTT/IV/2019","This research is a part of BINUS University research grant (Proposal Number: BNS2019-184; Contract Number: 033/VR.RTT/IV/2019), which got financial support from research transfer and technology office, Jakarta.

Two things presented in this paper are how the policy of the New Southbound Policy affects the education of Indonesia's young generation, and how is the collaboration of colleges and Industries in Vocational Training. This study uses library method and interviews with 260 students who follow the program lectures and internship for four years in Taiwan. They are spread across the industry of contact lens, plywood, electronics, software, steel mills, chemical plants, hotels, and resorts. Also, interviews are conducted to the foundation that bridges this program. This research concludes that colleges, industry, and students feel the significant benefits of collaborative programs between industry and academia. The college educates students who master Chinese in accordance with their field of work. While the industry becomes a place of the language practice and hard skills related to the competence of each department. Students get the benefit from overseas study opportunities and foreign language proficiency and income. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Education ties; Higher education; New southbound policy; Vocational training","Chemical plants; Distance education; Electronics industry; Collaborative programs; Foreign language; Higher education; Human development index; Indonesia; Library methods; Vocational training; Students",,,,,,"Sudarsana, I.K., Peningkatan Mutu Pendidikan Luar Sekolah Dalam Upaya Pembangunan Sumber Daya Manusia (2016) Jurnal Penjaminan Mutu, pp. 1-14. , ejournal.ihdn.ac.id; Schweke, W., (2004) Smart Money: Education and Economic Development, , Economic Policy Institute; (2017) New Southbound Policy Promotion Plan, , https://english.ey.gov.tw/News_Hot_Topic.aspx?n=D61190201622DA50&sms=B5449820D7077391, Executive Yuan; (2017) The Global Human Capital Report, , https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-human-capital-report-2017; (2017) Pendidikan Indonesia Sudah Merata Namun Kualitas Tidak Meningkat, , https://news.detik.com/australia-plus-abc/d3735729/pendidikan-indonesia-sudah-merata-namun-kualitas-tidak-meningkat; AnneLee, S., The silicon valley-hsinchu connection: technical communities and industrial upgrading (2001) Berkeley Planning Journal, 15 (1), pp. 3-31. , https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt0v02k7kd/qt0v02k7kd.pdf; Powell, J.J.W., Bernhard, N., Graf, L., The emergent european model in skill formation: Comparing higher education and vocational training in the bologna and copenhagen processes (2012) Sociology of Education, 85 (3), pp. 240-258; Meyer, J.W., World society, institutional theories and the actor (2010) Annual Review of Sociology, 36, pp. 1-20; Yuan, E., (2018) New Southbound Policy: Forging Win-Win Relationships, , https://english.ey.gov.tw/nsp/cp.aspx?n=FBD7C9498452B308; Wu, J.M., (2017) Taiwan Seeks to Build Soft Power with Retooled Southbound Policy, , https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-policysouthbound/taiwan-seeks-to-build-soft-power-with-retooledsouthbound-policy-idUSKBN1CI0P1, October, 13; Psacharopoulos, G., Patrinos, H.A., Returns to investment in education: A further update (2004) Education Economics, 12 (2), pp. 111-134; Alam, G.M., The role of science and technology education at network age population for sustainable development of Bangladesh through human resource advancement (2009) Scientific Research and Essay, 4 (11), pp. 1260-1270. , http://www.academicjournals.org/SRE; Today, T., (2017) New Southbound Policy Pays Handsome Trade, Education Dividends, , http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=2,6,10,15,18&post=110410, January, 17; (2017) 2017 World Population Date Sheet with A Special Focus on Youth, , http://www.prb.org/pdf17/2017_World_Population.pdf; Statistik, B.P., (2013) Indonesia Population Projection 2010-2035, , https://www.bappenas.go.id/files/5413/9148/4109/Proyeksi_Penduduk_Indonesia_2010-2035.pdf, Jakarta; (2018) Population of Cities in Taiwan, , http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/taiwan-population/cities/, Review; Indeks Pembangunan Manusia (Indonesia Human Development Index) Menurut Provinsi, , Badan Pusat Statistik; https://www.bps.go.id/linkTableDinamis/view/id/1211, 2010-2016 (Metode Baru); (2015) Meluasnya Ketimpangan Di Indonesia, , http://www.worldbank.org/in/news/feature/2015/12/08/indonesia-rising-divide, December 8; Ying, Y., Mursitama, T.N., Anggreani, S.L., Creating comprehensive Chinese training model for Taiwanese industry: An anticipation of Taiwan 'southbound policy. friendly city 4 ‘from research to implementation for better sustainability’ (2018) IOP Conf.

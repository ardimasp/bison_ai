Moreover, the implementation of a chatbot program in the industry helps the company to reduce their operational costs in engaging with their customers and employees. There are still quite a number of problems existed in order to build a human-like chatbot program. Understanding a natural conversation and replying back to the conversation the interlocutors, keeping the conversation flowing naturally is a cumbersome task for a computer. This research aims to design an emotionally realistic chatbot system to enhance the believability of the chatbot using Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) and Information State. The results show that there is a statistically significant improvement to the chatbot believability in the system that has emotions variables induced compare to the one without emotions. Moreover, 63,33% of the respondents perceived Aero and Iris as two different individuals. The future work of this research is to deploy and have an exploration of the chatbot system to other cases. © 2019 The Authors.

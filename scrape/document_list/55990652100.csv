One of the features of CRM are customer satisfaction level analyses. It is a verbal communication means of sending or receiving information. There are several intonations spoken during verbal communication that reflect the emotional state. Therefore, it can be used to get information regarding the level of customer satisfaction. Sound is one type of digital data that can be processed for an emotional state of classification. In this research, the authors decided to develop a mobile application that is integrated with machine learning to record a sound and classify it into a particular emotional state. This application is believed to be able to improve the user experience and simplify the installation to improve communication engagement. © 2019 IEEE.","component; formatting; style; styling","Android (operating system); Information management; Mobile computing; Public relations; Sales; Application development; component; Customer relationship management; formatting; Mobile applications; style; styling; Verbal communications; Customer satisfaction",,,,,"A Face Recognition System Based on Convolution Neural Network Using Multiple Distance Face, Soft Computing; A Simulation Model for the Waterfall Software Development Life Cycle, International Journal of Engineering & Technology, 25; Chennai, S., (2016) Salesforce, , https://www.salesforcetraining.education/importance-featuressalesforce-make-mandatory-learn/, July 26 Retrieved from www. salesforcetraining. education:; (2013) International Conference on Cognitive Infocommunications, 403-406, , Classification of Emotional Speech Units in Call Centre Interactions Budapest, IEEE; (2011) International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 5692-5695. , Iterative feature normalization for emotional speech detection Prague, Czech RepublicIEEE; (2015) Python in Science Conference, pp. 18-24. , librosa: Audio and Music Signal Analysis in Python; Speech Emotion Recognition Approaches in Human Computer Interaction, Telecommunication Systems, 523, pp. 1467-1478; Speech Emotion Recognition Using Support Vector Machine, International Journal of Smart Home, pp. 6101-6107; Priyotno, A., (2019), https://inet.detik.com/consumer/d-4446865/samsung-masih-rajaponsel-di-Indonesia-ini-daftar-5-besarnya, Feb 27 detik com.

Though there are numerous introduced algorithms to increase the spatial resolution for textual images, analysis on SR methods using deep learning is still insufficient. In this paper, we focus on evaluating the performance of various deep SR methods which have already confirmed to perform well in natural images super-resolution. Three evaluation metrics are used to analyze the performance of each method, such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structure similarity index (SSIM), and optical character recognition accuracy (OCRAcc). Experimental results show that deeper networks perform better than shallow networks for super-resolution problem. In overall, deep recursive convolutional network (DRCN) and deep laplacian pyramid network (LapSRN) alternately achieve the best performance. Then, very deep super-resolution network (VDSR) obtains the 3rd rank following both methods. © 2018 The Authors.

Due to the hardware limitation, image acquisition might get distracted by small field-of-view. Photo enhancement using internet photo collections has gained good performance in the past few years. However, it depends on the quality of 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we perform an automatic personal photo enhancement using the photo collection without any 3D reconstruction step. 2D global descriptor is used using NetVLAD deep architecture.

We obtain our dataset which is taken by using a web crawling method from www.cnnindonesia.com. First of all, the document will first undergo some Text Preprocessing method in the form of Lemmatization and Stopwords Removal. The reason we are doing the Text Preprocessing step before anything else is to minimize the noise in the document. Next, we apply Feature Selection onto the document to further separate important words and less important words inside the document. After applying Feature Selection, the document will be classified by the classifier. We are comparing the TF-IDF and SVD algorithm for feature selection, while also comparing the Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Multivariate Bernoulli Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine for the Classifiers. Based on the test results, the combination of TF-IDF and Multinomial Naïve Bayes Classifier gives the highest result compared to the other algorithms, which precision is 0.9841519 and its recall is 0.9840000.

NMF has so many variations. The NMF versions that will be used in this research are NMF, LNMF and nsNMF. NMF in this study will be used as a feature extraction and as for the classification technique, Neural Network method will be used. One of the variables in NMF that affect the quality of features is the value of r (number of base image). Objects used in this research were taken from the mammogram MIAS database. These objects will then be divided into 2 classes, Benign and Malignant. This research will explore what the r value is and which is the best variation of NMF to be used in this case. The results showed nsNMF with the value r = 20 is the best NMF to use in this case.The accuracy value reached 75%. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Bilinear space; Face expression recognition; NMF",,,,,,"MIAS Database, , http://peipa.essex.ac.uk/info/mias.html; Swiniarski, R., Luu, T., Swiniarska, A., Tanto, H., Datamining and online recognition of mammographic imagesbased on haar wavelets, principal component analysisand rough sets methods (2001) International SPIE SymposiumMedical Imaging, pp. 17-23; Kim, K., Face recognition using principle component analysis (1996) International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 586-591; Sandhu, P.S., Face recognition using eigen face coefficientsand principal component analysis (2009) International Journal of Electrical and Electronics Engineering; Li, S.Z., Hou, X.W., Zhang, H.J., Learning spatially localized, parts-based representation (2001) Int.

DT-CWT can be used as extracted feature of image. DT-CWT can reduce the dimension of highly dimensional data such as large image. This paper use DT-CWT as feature extraction to obtain feature. This paper use Neural Network for recognition and using extracted feature as input and discuss about finding the effective number of node in Neural Network. Through this research, it can be concluded that one hidden layer give better accuracy compared to two hidden layers. A few number of nodes give same result of large number of nodes. The number of each hidden layer not influence the accuracy, but with few numbers of nodes has better time process. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Dtcwt; Face recognition; Neural network",,,,,,"Faundez-Zanuy, M., (2009) Biometric Security Technology, Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence, pp. 262-264; Kingsbury, N.G., The dual-tree complex wavelet transform: A new technique for shift invariance and directional filters (1998) IEEE Digital Signal Processing Workshop, DSP, 98 (86). , Bryce Canyon; Raja, K.B., Ramesha, K., Dual transform based feature extraction for face recognition (2011) IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, 8 (5). , No 2; Sun, Y., Du, M., Robust face recognition for illumination removal using DT-CWT and EMD (2008) 11th IEEE International Conference on Communication Systems 2008, pp. 357-361; Rajesh, R.S., Jaya Priya, K., Dual tree complex wavelet transform based face recognition with single view (2011) Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (CICN), pp. 601-605; Kingsbury, N.G., Complex wavelets for shift invariance analysis and filtering of signals (2001) Journal of Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis, 10 (3), pp. 234-253","Information Technology, Jl.

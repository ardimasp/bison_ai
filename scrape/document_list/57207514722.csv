Interface engineering is typically employed to prolong the material lifecycle by hindering crack propagation across the layers of nanolaminates. Various studies have been performed to understand the role of interfaces during plastic deformation in such nanolaminates. Nevertheless, detailed studies with direct observation capability on the mechanisms of deformation leading to failure are still scarce, especially in bending mode (which is the more realistic loading condition of structural materials in service). Therefore, in this study, in situ beam bending tests (inside a Scanning Electron Microscope) were performed on accumulative roll bonded (ARB) pre-notched Cu/Nb clamped beams. A large extent of notch widening (which was used as a measure for the extent of the capacity of the materials for interfacial sliding/shearing) during cross-layer fracture was observed for Cu/Nb (16 nm) ARB beams (i.e., with 16 nm individual layer thickness in both Cu and Nb layers) which were fabricated along the transverse direction (TD) of the ARB process. This may be attributed to an increase in layer strength (due to the small sizes) and interface-based localized plastic mechanisms (sliding/shearing, rotation, etc.). Upon comparison with our previous work (Cu/Nb ARB samples with large individual layer thickness, or fabricated along different directions in the ARB process), the extent of the interfacial sliding was found to be significantly large, indicating possible size effects and/or different/additional mechanisms of localized shearing/plasticity on the interfaces. These mechanisms can be further exploited for the design and development of a novel class of metallic flexible materials or conductor technologies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Fracture mechanism; In situ beam bending; interface plasticity; Multilayers; Nanolaminates; Semi-coherent interface","Bending tests; Copper metallography; Fracture; Life cycle; Scanning electron microscopy; Accumulative roll-bonded; Design and Development; Direct observations; Flexible materials; Interface engineering; Interfacial sliding; Loading condition; Plastic mechanism; Bending (deformation)",,,,"RGNRF1904","ASB and RS contributed equally to this work.

Parallel plate far field electrospinning (also known as the gap electrospinning) is generally used to produce uniaxially aligned fibers between the two parallel collector plates. In the first step, a disc containing PVA/H2 O solution/bath (matrix material) was placed in between the two parallel plate collectors. Next, a layer of uniaxially aligned sub-micron PAN fibers (filler material) produced by pp-FFES was directly collected/embedded in the PVA/H2 O solution by bringing the fibers in contact with the matrix. Next, the disc containing the matrix solution was rotated at 45◦ angular offset and then the next layer of the uniaxial fibers was collected/stacked on top of the previous layer with now 45◦ rotation between the two layers. This process was continued progressively by stacking the layers of uniaxially aligned arrays of fibers at 45◦ angular offsets, until a periodic pattern was achieved. In total, 13 such layers were laid within the matrix solution to make a helicoidal geometry with three pitches. The results demonstrate that embedding the helicoidal PAN fibers within the PVA enables efficient load transfer during high rate loading such as impact. The fabricated PVA strong polymer thin films with helicoidally arranged PAN fiber reinforcement (PVA SPTF-HA) show specific tensile strength 5 MPa · cm3· g−1 and can sustain specific impact energy (8 ± 0.9) mJ · cm3· g−1, which is superior to that of the pure PVA thin film (PVA TF) and PVA SPTF with randomly oriented PAN fiber reinforcement (PVA SPTF-RO). The novel fabrication methodology enables the further capability to produce even further smaller fibers (sub-micron down to even nanometer scales) and by the virtue of its layer-by-layer processing (in the manner of an additive manufacturing methodology) allowing further modulation of interfacial and inter-fiber adherence with the matrix materials. These parameters allow greater control and tunability of impact performances of the synthetic materials for various applications from army combat wear to sports and biomedical/wearable applications. © 2020 by the authors.

Nanoscale metal-metal multilayered materials provide a model material system platform to understand plasticity and fracture based on dislocation interactions with microstructural features. Recently, there is a growing trend to understand the fracture of multilayered materials to see the interactions between the crack and multilayered interface through novel experimentation techniques. In this review, we will introduce the rationale, the current microfracture methods to test and analyze the multilayer fracture behavior and the challenges faced in performing them. Four examples of in situ fracture techniques are highlighted in this work through tensile testing of film on a substrate: microfracture clamped beam bending technique across the multilayers and delamination along the multilayered interface. © 2019 Materials Research Society.","fracture; layered; nanoscale","Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Fracture testing; Metals; Multilayers; Nanotechnology; Plasticity; Tensile testing; Dislocation interaction; Engineering systems; Fracture behavior; layered; Microstructural features; Model material systems; Multilayered materials; Nano scale; Nanostructured materials",,,,"IDG31400102","This work is also funded by the SUTD-MIT International Design Center (IDC), Singapore, under contract IDG31400102.",,"Misra, A., Demkowicz, M., Zhang, X., Hoagland, R., The radiation damage tolerance of ultra-high strength nanolayered composites (2007) JOM, 59, p. 62; Zhang, X., Fu, E., Li, N., Misra, A., Wang, Y.-Q., Shao, L., Wang, H., Design of radiation tolerant nanostructured metallic multilayers (2012) J.

Recent literature has shown promise for fracture being delayed or even stopped at these interfaces. However, no studies have investigated the influence of their constituents on the subsequent mechanisms of fracture leading to failure. We performed in situ microfracture bending tests of the notched clamped beams made from physical vapor deposited Cu/Nb and Al/Nb multilayers. A catastrophic, linear elastic, brittle fracture was observed for the Cu/Nb beams, whereas a more delayed fracture with a gradual crack propagation was observed for the Al/Nb beams. These observations reveal differences in mechanisms because of the FCC element, interface/boundary blocking of dislocation motion, and effect of grain boundaries in the multilayers. Through this study, FCC/BCC metallic multilayers can be designed with enhanced fracture resistance and mechanical strength. © 2019 Materials Research Society.","fracture; layered; nanoscale","Bending tests; Fracture; Grain boundaries; Delayed fracture; Dislocation motion; Face-centered cubic; layered; Metallic multilayers; Multilayer interface; Nano scale; Physical vapor deposited; Multilayers",,,,,,,"Misra, A., Hoagland, R.G., (2011) Dekker Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, pp. 1-10. , 3rd ed.

However, it expands by 300% on lithiation, leading to fracture. Nanostructuring of silicon is expected to be a promising method to improve the mechanical strength of the silicon electrodes. In the present work, a unique battery test cell was designed and fabricated to study the in situ stress evolution in the silicon nanowire (SiNW) electrode during electrochemical lithiation using synchrotron X-ray microdiffraction. The stress in the SiNWs at pristine state and during lithiation was evaluated using energy scans. The average stress in the pristine nanowires was found to be ∼40 MPa tensile, which changed to ∼325 MPa compressive on lithiation. Further, the deviatoric stress state in the SiNWs during lithiation was evaluated using Laue diffraction and the lithiated nanowires were found to be in triaxial stress state with high shear stresses. The technique and the findings provide new and more in-depth understanding of the stress evolution in the SiNWs during electrochemical lithiation. © 2019 Materials Research Society.","nanostructure; strength; X-ray diffraction (XRD)","Electrochemical electrodes; Lithium-ion batteries; Nanostructures; Nanowires; Shear stress; Silicon; Silicon compounds; X ray diffraction; Deviatoric stress state; Electrochemical lithiation; In-depth understanding; In-situ synchrotrons; Silicon nanowires; strength; Synchrotron x rays; Tri-axial stress state; Nitrogen compounds",,,,"University of California Berkeley, UC Berkeley

Cracks initiate and propagate as a result of high residual stresses in silicon cells and cause power losses. In this study, the stresses in the longitudinal cross-section of a PV laminate during the soldering and lamination processes are simulated and studied. A parametric study of the effect of interconnect thickness and yield strength is also performed and the results show that a peak maximum stress is reached at a certain interconnect to cell thickness ratio. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Recent reports show significant effect of encapsulation polymer material on cell cracks leading to the idea of tailoring encapsulation materials for more reliable PV modules. This paper investigates the effect of encapsulation modulus on the cell residual stress using Synchrotron scanning X-ray microdiffraction (µSXRD), which has been proven to be an effective technique to probe the stress in silicon solar cells, especially once they are encapsulated. The post lamination residual stress in the encapsulated multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells was reported for the first time using µSXRD in this manuscript and provide quantitative evaluation of the effect of encapsulation modulus on the cell residual stress. Further, simple approximate finite element (FE) model was also developed to evaluate the effect of the encapsulation polymer on the cell stress. The FE simulations predict the trend of the stress variation with encapsulation polymer modulus very well. Dynamic mechanical analysis and rheological testing of the encapsulation polymers was also performed to correlate the polymer behaviour with the experimental and simulated stresses. Both experimental and simulation results show a similar trend of significant cell stress variation with encapsulation polymer modulus. In the case of external loading, the temperature of load application is observed to be very significant as it dictates the elastic state of the encapsulant, leading to critical conclusion that the encapsulant needs to be selected based on elastic behaviour over the temperature history of the encapsulant during module fabrication and operation. The results and discussion presented are expected to be very useful for development of more reliable PV modules. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,"Cracks; Crystalline materials; Photovoltaic cells; Polymer solar cells; Polymers; Residual stresses; Solar cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; X ray diffraction; X rays; Effect of encapsulation; Multi-crystalline silicon; Multi-crystalline silicon solar cells; Photovoltaic modules; Quantitative evaluation; Rheological testing; Temperature history; X ray microdiffraction; Silicon solar cells",,,,"Economic Development Board - Singapore, EDB

The stress induced in the cells during the photovoltaic module integration (soldering and encapsulation) processes is significant as they may be high enough to cause cell fracture or propagate the pre-existing micro cracks. In a well-controlled cell soldering and encapsulation process in the industry, this stress may not cause significant cell cracking, but the stressed regions can still act as crack localization sites under the external operational loads. With the advent of thin silicon wafers to reduce material costs and increase productivity, the cells may become even more fragile and susceptible to fractures during the module fabrication processes. In this scenario, the PV industry is looking for methods and materials to reduce cell stresses. In this work we simulate the effect of the encapsulation polymers on cell stress and show that the encapsulant elastic modulus and thickness significantly affect cell stress, during the module fabrication and operation as well. The results suggest that the choice of the encapsulant can help to reduce the cell stress and improve the module reliability. The results further show that the effect of the encapsulant is much more significant for thinner cells, and that the effect of the front encapsulant is more significant compared to that of the back encapsulant. A physical model of constrained local curvature of the cell in the PV module is also proposed to explain the effects of the encapsulant modulus on the cell stress. © 2019 International Solar Energy Society","Encapsulant; Encapsulation polymer; Encapsulation residual stress simulation; Photovoltaic module; Residual stress; Silicon cell stress","Cracks; Fracture; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Polymer solar cells; Polymers; Residual stresses; Silicon wafers; Solar power generation; Soldering; Encapsulants; Encapsulation process; Methods and materials; Performance degradation; Photovoltaic modules; Residual stress simulations; Silicon cells; Solar photovoltaics; Silicon solar cells; curvature; elastic modulus; encapsulation; fracture; fuel cell; microcrack; photovoltaic system; polymer; residual stress; silicon; simulation; solar power; thermochemistry",,,,"Economic Development Board - Singapore, EDB

These materials can withstand very high strains in the elastic regime without any inelastic relaxation due to plasticity or fracture compared to its bulk counterparts. This extended elastic regime opens up new possibilities for tuning the physical and chemical properties of materials as well as bringing novel functionalities, such as high performance coating materials with online strain monitoring capability. Our resistivity measurements during ex situ uniaxial micropillar compression in this article suggests basic feasibility of a Cu–Nb multilayered nanocomposite with 20 nm layer thickness having a novel functionality for online strain monitoring capability, in addition to its more known application as a high performance coating materials due to its extraordinary strength and deformability. A linear trend of resistivity with respect to true strain for strains in excess of 3.5% was observed and suggests a significant regime for use for strain sensor/detection/monitoring capability. © IMechE 2017.","dislocation density; Nanolayer; nanopillar; resistivity; strain sensing","Coatings; Electric conductivity; Mechanical properties; Nanocomposites; Nanopillars; Plating; Strength of materials; Dislocation densities; High performance coatings; Micro-pillar compressions; Nano layers; NanoPillar; Performance requirements; Physical and chemical properties; Strain sensing; Strain",,,,"IDG31400102","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors gratefully acknowledge receipt of funding and support from SUTD-MIT International Design Centre (IDC), Singapore for the project under IDC Grant ‘(IDG31400102) – Designing Nanomaterials Through Atomic Engineering of Interfaces’.",,"Olson, G.B., Designing a new material world (2000) Science, 288, pp. 993-998; Magee, C.L., Wood, K.L., Frey, D.D., Advancing design research: A “Big-D” design perspective (2013) 4Th International Conference on Research into Design (Icord'13), Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering, pp. 41-60. , Springer India; Cross, J., Opila, R., Boyd, I., Materials characterization and the evolution of materials (2015) MRS Bull, 40, pp. 1019-1034; Holdren, J., (2014) Materials genome initiative: strategic plan, p. 6. , Washington, DC, Office of Science and Technology Policy; Holdren, J.P., (2011) Materials genome initiative for global competitiveness, , Washington, DC, National Science and Technology Council OSTP; Drosback, M., (2013) The Materials Genome Initiative and Materials Innovation Infrastructure, , https://hubzero.org/resources/1167/download/Cyberinfrastructure_for_the_Materials_Genome_Initiative.pdf, Washington, DC: Office of Science and Technology Policy, accessed 28 November 2016; Robinson, L., Looking back while moving forward: Cyrus Wadia discusses the evolution of MGI (2015) JOM, 67; http://www.damadei.eu/report/, Commission E.

These interfaces could play a role in hindering cracks from propagating across the nanolayers while in operation. To date, many studies have focused on the roles of interfaces in affecting the plasticity mechanisms and thus the deformability of nanolayers. However, no studies have investigated on the subsequent mechanisms of fracture leading to the final failure. In this study, in situ microfracture bending tests inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM) were performed on the notched clamped beams of Cu/Nb nanolayers with a similar layer thickness using two different fabrication processes: physical vapor deposition (PVD) and accumulative roll bonding (ARB). Due to the columnar grains of the Cu/Nb PVD beams, a sudden catastrophic linear elastic, brittle fracture phenomenon was observed; in the Cu/Nb ARB beams, fracture events of notch widening phase and crack initiation and fracture along the shear instability were observed. Detailed examinations showed the presence of competing mechanisms between the multilayered interface, columnar grain boundary, and experimental factors of beam geometry and the position of the tip. With this newfound knowledge, new types of metallic nanolayers can be designed with enhanced strength and fracture resistant properties. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Fracture behavior; Grains and interfaces; In situ beam bending; Multilayers; Plasticity mechanisms","Bending tests; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Grain boundaries; Microstructural evolution; Multilayers; Physical vapor deposition; Plasticity; Roll bonding; Scanning electron microscopy; Accumulative roll bonding; Beam bending; Competing mechanisms; Experimental factors; Fabrication process; Fracture behavior; Metallic nanolayers; Microstructural features; Cracks",,,,,,,"Beyerlein, I.J., Mara, N.A., Carpenter, J.S., Nizolek, T., Mook, W.M., Wynn, T.A., Interface-driven microstructure development and ultra high strength of bulk nanostructured Cu-Nb multilayers fabricated by severe plastic deformation (2013) J.

Indium is one of the key materials or alloy components in advanced microelectronics and the nanotechnology industry, and understanding their mechanical behaviors at nanoscales becomes increasingly important to ensure lifetime reliability of their applications in novel nanoscale devices or advanced systems (for packaging at the nanoscales, for instance). Synchrotron X-ray microdiffraction has been utilized to examine defect structures of nanoscale materials as well as their strain-rate responses. Nanoscale or advanced microelectronics packaging, for instance, require acceptable levels of drop test results. For these low melting temperature materials especially, this technique offers a unique advantage as conventional methods such as transmission electron microscope and EBSD will expose the structure to high-energy electron beams that may significantly alter the microstructure and defect structure during analysis. Using this approach, we found interesting differences in term of X-ray peak broadening after deformation with different strain rates, which could indicate differences in plasticity mechanisms in the submicron pillars of indium, which could be important for their applications in nanodevices. Understanding these differences could lead to better control of mechanical properties of low melting temperature metals at the nanoscales and, thus, have important implications for nanodevice reliability. © 2001-2011 IEEE.","Indium; nanopillars; plasticity; synchrotron; XRD","Crystal lattices; Crystals; Defect structures; Defects; Indium; Mechanical properties; Melting point; Microelectronics; Nanostructured materials; Nanotechnology; Packaging materials; Plasticity; Strain; Synchrotrons; X ray diffraction; High energy electron beams; Low melting temperatures; Microelectronics packaging; Nanopillars; Nanoscale device; Nanotechnology industry; X ray microdiffraction; X ray peak broadening; Strain rate",,,,"IDG31400102

This occurs as result of stresses developing in the cells due to thermo-mechanical stresses that arise when there is a mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the different constituent materials during the manufacturing processes as well as mechanical stresses from hail, snow and wind during field operations. Through finite element simulations, this paper investigates the effect of interconnect cross-sectional geometry on stresses developed in silicon cells during the entire PV manufacturing cycle and provides physical reasoning to its stress evolution. The simulations are performed in a sequential manner whereby the residual stresses developed at the end of one step is brought forward to the beginning of the next step. It is found that the highest cell stresses occur at the back surfaces of the cells at the end of the pressure-ramping step during lamination. In addition, increasing the thickness of the front interconnects significantly increases the stresses developed in the cells during lamination. This predicted trend is verified experimentally. © 2018","Crystalline silicon cell; Encapsulation stress; Lamination stress; Solar PV; Soldering stress; Thermo-mechanical residual stress","Crystalline materials; Laminating; Photovoltaic effects; Precipitation (meteorology); Residual stresses; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Thermal expansion; Constituent materials; Crosssectional geometry; Crystalline silicon cells; Crystalline solar cells; Finite element simulations; Solar PVs; Thermo-mechanical; Thermo-mechanical stress; Silicon solar cells",,,,"Economic Development Board - Singapore, EDB

It has been observed that, for the case of metal–metal nanolaminates with a semicoherent interface, such as Cu/Nb, low interface shear strength increases the interface barrier to dislocation crossing, which improves nanolaminate plasticity. In this study, we use Cu (63 nm)/Nb(63 nm) accumulative roll-bonded nanolaminates, which have a large anisotropy of the interface shear strength between rolling and transverse directions (RD and TD, respectively), to study the effect of interface shear strength on the failure in metal–metal nanolaminates with a semicoherent interface during in situ clamped beam bending. Further, finite element analysis is used to understand the observed behavior. The results show a substantial difference between the fracture behaviors along the RD and TD owing to differences in the interface shear strength and grain size. For the RD beams, the slip bands originate from the Nb layers at the notch/crack tip followed by crack propagation along these bands. For the TD beams, the crack propagation is inhibited by interface shear. We suggest that shear bands form subsequently through the beam and lead to the final beam failure. However, under the assumption of the presence of the grain boundaries near the stress concentration zone, the interface shear in the TD beams could be inhibited. In this case, the crack growth can be attributed to the formation of microcracks at grain boundaries beside the main crack. © 2018","Bending test; Cu/Nb ARB; Fracture mechanisms; Interface; Multilayers","Bending tests; Crack propagation; Grain boundaries; Interfaces (materials); Joints (structural components); Metals; Microcracks; Multilayers; Rolling; Shear flow; Accumulative roll-bonded; Fracture behavior; Fracture mechanisms; Interface barrier; Interface shear strength; Plastic deformation mechanisms; Semi-coherent interfaces; Stress concentration zone; Failure (mechanical)",,,,"IDG31400102","The authors acknowledge Dr. Nathan Mara from Los Alamos National Laboratory and Prof. Irene Beyerlein from the University of California , Santa Barbara for providing Cu/Nb ARB laminates; Dr. Liu Qing from Nanyang Technological University , Singapore for the help with FIB cutting of the beams.

However, silicon expands up to 300% during lithiation, which induces high stresses and leads to fractures. To design silicon nanostructures that could minimize fracture, it is important to understand and characterize stress states in the silicon nanostructures during lithiation. Synchrotron X-ray microdiffraction has proven to be effective in revealing insights of mechanical stress and other mechanics considerations in small-scale crystalline structures used in many important technological applications, such as microelectronics, nanotechnology, and energy systems. In the present study, an in situ synchrotron X-ray microdiffraction experiment was conducted to elucidate the mechanical stress states during the first electrochemical cycle of lithiation in single-crystalline silicon nanowires (SiNWs) in an LIB test cell. Morphological changes in the SiNWs at different levels of lithiation were also studied using scanning electron microscope (SEM). It was found from SEM observation that lithiation commenced predominantly at the top surface of SiNWs followed by further progression toward the bottom of the SiNWs gradually. The hydrostatic stress of the crystalline core of the SiNWs at different levels of electrochemical lithiation was determined using the in situ synchrotron X-ray microdiffraction technique. We found that the crystalline core of the SiNWs became highly compressive (up to -325.5 MPa) once lithiation started. This finding helps unravel insights about mechanical stress states in the SiNWs during the electrochemical lithiation, which could potentially pave the path toward the fracture-free design of silicon nanostructure anode materials in the next-generation LIB. © 2018 Ali, Tippabhotla, Radchenko, Al-Obeidi, Stan, Tamura and Budiman.","Deformation; In situ; Lithiation; Lithium-ion battery; Single-crystalline silicon nanowires; Stress; Synchrotron X-ray microdiffraction","Anodes; Crystalline materials; Deformation; Lithium-ion batteries; Microelectronics; Monocrystalline silicon; Nanowires; Scanning electron microscopy; Stresses; X ray diffraction; X rays; Electrochemical cycle; Electrochemical lithiation; Lithiation; Morphological changes; Silicon nano structures; Single crystalline silicon; Synchrotron x rays; Technological applications; Fracture",,,,"University of California Berkeley, UC Berkeley

This implies that high residual stresses are developed in the cells. In this paper, the evolution of stresses in solar cells throughout the manufacturing cycle of a conventional PV laminate is simulated in a sequential step-by-step manner such that the residual stresses at the end of one step is brought forward to the next. By analyzing the principal stresses generated in the cells, the critical instances in themanufacturing cycle can be identified. The accumulated final residual stresses in the PV laminate are determined, which include the postsoldering, lamination, and postlamination thermal stresses because of the coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch between the laminate constituent materials. In addition, stresses in the cells during the pressure-ramping step of the lamination process are determined and found to be the most critical in the entire PV laminate manufacturing cycle. The effect of cell thickness on the evolution of stresses in the cells throughout the manufacturing cycle of a conventional PV laminate are also investigated. © 2017 IEEE.","Crystalline silicon cell; Encapsulation; Lamination stress; Soldering stress; Thermomechanical (TM) residual stress","Encapsulation; Fracture; Laminates; Laminating; Manufacture; Photoelectrochemical cells; Photovoltaic cells; Residual stresses; Silicon; Silicon wafers; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Soldering; Thermal expansion; Constituent materials; Crystalline silicon cells; Lamination; Lamination process; Manufacturing cycle; Photovoltaic laminate; Photovoltaic modules; Thermo-mechanical; Silicon solar cells",,,,"Economic Development Board - Singapore, EDB

Shells of mantis club have protein fibres arranged in a 3D helicoidal architecture that give them remarkable strength and toughness, enabling them to absorb high-impact energy. This complex architecture is now possible to replicate with the recent advances in additive manufacturing. In this paper, we used melt electrospinning to fabricate 3D polycaprolactone (PCL) fibrous design to mimic the natural helicoidal structures found in the shells of the mantis shrimp's dactyl club. To improve the tensile deformation behavior of the structures, the surface of each layer of the samples were treated with carboxyl and amino groups. The toughness of the surface-treated helicoidal sample was found to be two times higher than the surface-treated unidirectional sample and five times higher than the helicoidal sample without surface treatment. Free amino groups (NH2) were introduced on the surface of the fibres and membrane via surface treatment to increase the interaction and adhesion among the different layers of membranes. We believe that this represents a preliminary feasibility in our attempt to mimic the 3D helicoidal architectures at small scales, and we still have room to improve further using even smaller fibre sizes of the modeled architectures. These lightweight synthetic analogue materials enabled by electrospinning as an additive manufacturing methodology would potentially display superior structural properties and functionalities such as high strength and extreme toughness.

Many failures due to fracture have been reported from the field because of environmental loading (snow, wind, etc.) as well as mishandling of the solar PV modules (during installation, maintenance, etc.). However, a significantly higher number of failures have also been reported during module encapsulation (lamination) indicating high residual stress in the modules and thus more prone to cell cracking. We report here, through the use of synchrotron X-ray submicron diffraction coupled with physics-based finite element modeling, the complete residual stress evolution in mono-crystalline silicon solar cells during PV module integration process. For the first time, we unravel the reason for the high stress and cracking of silicon cells near soldered inter-connects. Our experiments revealed a significant increase of residual stress in the silicon cell near the solder joint after lamination. Moreover, our finite element simulations show that this increase of stress during lamination is a result of highly localized bending of the cell near the soldered inter-connects. Further, the synchrotron X-ray submicron diffraction has proven to be a very effective way to quantitatively probe mechanical stress in encapsulated silicon solar cells. Thus, this technique has ultimately enabled these findings leading to the enlightening of the role of soldering and encapsulation processes on the cell residual stress. This model can be further used to suggest methodologies that could lead to lower stress in encapsulated silicon solar cells, which are the subjects of our continued investigations.

Consequently, fracture mechanisms in the thin silicon solar cells during soldering and lamination need to be fully understood quantitatively in order to enable photovoltaics (PV) systems implementation in both manufacturing and field operations. Synchrotron X-ray Microdiffraction (µSXRD) has proven to be a very effective means to quantitatively probe the mechanical stress which is the driving force of the fracture mechanisms (initiation, propagation, and propensity) in the thin silicon solar cells, especially when they are already encapsulated. In this article, we present the first ever stress examination in encapsulated thin silicon solar cells and show how nominally the same silicon solar cells encapsulated by different polymer encapsulants could have very different residual stresses after the lamination process. It is then not difficult to see how the earlier observation, as reported by Sander et al. (2013) [1], of very different fracture rates within the same silicon solar cells encapsulated by different Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) materials could come about. The complete second degree tensor components of the residual stress of the silicon solar cells after lamination process are also reported in this paper signifying the full and unique capabilities of the Synchrotron X-Ray Microdiffraction technique not only for measuring residual stress but also for measuring other potential mechanical damage within thin silicon solar cells. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Fracture; Stress; Synchrotron X-ray microdiffraction; Thin silicon solar cells","Cost reduction; Diffraction; Ethylene; Fracture; Laminating; Polymer solar cells; Residual stresses; Silicon; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Stresses; Thermoplastic elastomers; X ray diffraction; Ethylene vinyl acetates; Fracture mechanisms; Lamination process; Mechanical damages; Polymer encapsulants; Silicon solar cell technology; Synchrotron x rays; Systems implementation; Silicon solar cells",,,,,,,"Sander, M., Dietrich, S., Pander, M., Ebert, M., Bagdahn, J., Systematic investigation of cracks in encapsulated solar cells after mechanical loading (2013) Sol.

These residual stresses may become detrimental in the context of thinner silicon cells (<180μm) causing cracking, performance loss and failures. In such a scenario a systematic evaluation of these residual stresses considering realistic material properties is required to assess the risk levels. In the present work, soldering induced residual stresses in the back contact c-Si solar cells were evaluated using finite element simulations. Effect of plasticity of the copper interconnects on the cell residual stress was studied. It was observed that the linear elastic material property of interconnect and solder over predicts the cell stress significantly and hence elastic-plastic material properties are needed for realistic predictions. Simulated stresses were also compared with those of synchrotron X-ray micro-diffraction experiments for cell thickness of 180μm to validate the finite element model. Further residual stress was evaluated as a function of silicon cell thickness in order to assess the risk of thinning cells for the current soldering process. These results are expected to enable optimization of soldering and interconnect parameters to mitigate high residual stress and thereby cell fractures. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Copper; Crystalline materials; Elastoplasticity; Electronics packaging; Finite element method; Integrated circuit interconnects; Plasticity; Residual stresses; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Silicon; Solar cells; Soldering; Copper interconnects; Crystalline silicon solar cells; Elastic-plastic material properties; Finite element simulations; Interconnect parameter; Linear elastic material; Synchrotron x rays; Systematic evaluation; Silicon solar cells",,,,,,,"Review of failures of pv modules Report: IEA-PVPS T13-01:2014, Photovoltaic Power Systems Program, International Energy Agency, , http//www.iea-pvps.org/index.phpid=275); Gabor, A., Ralli, M., Montminy, S., Alegria, L., Bordonaro, C., Woods, J., Felton, L., Soldering induced damage to thin Si solar cells and detection of cracked cells in modules (2006) Proceedings of EUPVSEC; Bennet, I.J., Low-stress interconnection of solar cells (2007) 22nd European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference and Exhibition, , Milan, Italy, 3-7 september; Pingel, S., Zemen, Y., Geipel, T., Berghold, J., Mechanical stability of solar cells within solar panels (2009) Proc. 24th European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conf, pp. 3459-3463. , Hamburg, Germany; Wendt, J., Trager, M., Mette, M., Pfennig, A., Jaeckel, B., The link between mechanical stress induced by soldering and micro damages in silicon solar cells (2009) Proceedings of EUPVSEC, pp. 3420-3423; Dietrich, S., Pander, M., Sander, M., Schulze, S.H., Ebert, M., Mechanical and thermo-mechanical assessment of encapsulated solar cells by finite-element-simulation (2008) Proceedings of SPIE-The International Society for Optical Engineering; Sander, M., Dietrich, S., Pander, M., Schweizer, S., Ebert, M., Bagdahn, J., Investigations on crack development and crack growth in embedded solar cells (2011) Proceedings of SPIE-The International Society for Optical Engineering; Dietrich, S., Pander, M., Sander, M., Ebert, M., Mechanical investigations on metallization layouts of solar cells with respect to module reliability (2013) Energy Procedia, 38, pp. 488-497; Eitner, U., (2011) Thermomechanical Analysis of Photovoltaic Modules, , PhD Thesis, Centre for Engineering Sciences, Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg, Germany; Hassan, O., Finite element modeling, analysis, and life prediction of photovoltaic modules (2014) J. of Solar Energy Engg., Transcations of the ASME, 136. , MAY; Lee, Y., Tay, A.A.O., Finite thermal analysis of a solar photovoltaic module (2011) 37th PVSC Conf, , Seattle, 19-24 June; Lee, Y., Tay, A.A.O., Stress analysis of silicon wafer based photovoltaic modules in operation (2012) PV Specialist Conference, , Austin, 3-8 June; Budiman, A.S., Enabling thin silicon technologies for next generation c-Si solar PV renewable energy systems using synchrotron X-ray microdiffraction as stress and crack mechanism probe (2014) Solar Energy Materials & Solar Cells, 130, pp. 303-308; Kumar Tippabhotla, S., Synchrotron x-ray micro-diffraction-probing stress state in encapsulated thin silicon solar cells (2016) Procedia Engineering, 139, pp. 123-133; Budiman, A.S., (2015) Probing Crystal Plasticity at the Nanoscales, , Springer; Kunz, M., Tamura, N., Chen, K., MacDowell, A.A., Celestre, R.S., Church, M.M., Morrison, G.Y., A dedicated superbend X-ray microdiffraction beamline for materials, geo, and environmental sciences at the advanced light source (2009) Review of Scientific Instruments, 80 (3), p. 035108; Tamura, N., Kunz, M., Chen, K., Celestre, R.S., MacDowell, A.A., Warwick, T., A superbend X-ray microdiffraction beamline at the advanced light source (2009) Materials Science and Engineering A-structural Materials Properties Microstructure and Processing, 524, pp. 28-32; Tamura, N., Padmore, H.A., Patel, J.R., High spatial resolution stress measurements using synchrotron based scanning X-ray microd-iffraction with white or monochromatic beam (2005) Materials Science and Engineering A-structural Materials Properties Microstructure and Processing, 399, pp. 92-98; Tamura, N., XMAS: A versatile tool for analyzing synchrotron x-ray microdiffraction data (2014) Chapter-4 of Strain and Dislocation Gradients from Diffraction, World Scientific; (2015) Version 6.14, SIMULIA, Dassault Systemes Simulia Corp, p. 21. , http//www.kaajakari.net/~ville/research/tutorials/elasticity_tutorial.pdf, ABAQUS Documentation,(Last accessed, May 2016); Guo, Z., Modeling material properties of lead-free solder alloys (2008) J. of Electronic Mat., 37 (1); Yeung, B., Correlation between mechanical tensile properties and microstructure of eutectic Sn-3.5Ag solder (2002) J.

Phase composition, crystal orientation and strain can all be probed in few-second time scales. Crystalline changes over a large areas can be also probed in a reasonable amount of time with submicron spatial resolution. However, despite all the listed capabilities, μ XRD is mostly used to study pure materials but its application in actual device characterization is rather limited. This article will explore the recent developments of the μ XRD technique illustrated with its advanced applications in microelectronic devices and solar photovoltaic systems. Application of μ XRD in microelectronics will be illustrated by studying stress and microstructure evolution in Cu TSV (through silicon via) during and after annealing. The approach allowing study of the microstructural evolution in the solder joint of crystalline Si solar cells due to thermal cycling will be also demonstrated. © 2016, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","Reliability; solar PV; TSV; μ XRD","Characterization; Crystal orientation; Crystalline materials; Diffraction; Electronics packaging; Integrated circuit manufacture; Intermetallics; Microelectronics; Microstructural evolution; Microstructure; Phase composition; Photovoltaic cells; Reliability; Silicon solar cells; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Timing circuits; X ray diffraction; Advanced applications; Crystalline Si solar cells; Device characterization; Micro-electronic devices; Micro-structure evolutions; Solar photovoltaic system; Solar PVs; Submicron spatial resolution; Three dimensional integrated circuits",,,,"Economic Development Board - Singapore, EDB

The samples were subjected to successive compression straining up to a final cumulative strain of 35%. The nanolayer composite exhibited a maximum flow strength of ~1.6. GPa at approximately 24% compressive strain. Synchrotron X-ray micro-diffraction experiments, using a monochromatic beam of 10. keV energy were performed after each compression strain increment. We observed a significant increase in X-ray ring width peak broadening in both Cu and Nb layers up to strains of ~3.5% followed by saturation broadening at higher strains. This observation indicates that the interfaces of the Cu/Nb nanolayers are very effective in trapping and annihilating dislocation content during mechanical deformation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Dislocation saturation; Incoherent interface; Nanolayers; Peak broadening; Pillar compression; Single crystal","Deformation; Diffraction; Dislocations (crystals); Multilayers; Nanotechnology; Strain; X ray diffraction; Compression strain; Compressive deformations; Dislocation densities; Incoherent interfaces; Mechanical deformation; Nano layers; Peak broadening; Saturation broadening; Single crystals",,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE

It is shown that the interconnect texture is an important factor, governing the plastic response of Cu grains to the electrical current. The degree of the plastic response is proportional with the availability of 〈112〉 direction in Cu crystals along the direction of the current. Hence, (111) out-of-plane orientation of Cu grains increases the plastic effect of electromigration, while the presence of the grains with a different orientation could weaken it. © 2015, The Author(s).","Dielectric;

The µSXRD technique offers the unique capability to study the plastic evolution of the grains in the interconnect lines during electromigration (in situ) at the submicron resolution. These experiments provide useful insights and may also provide important practical implications, as will be discussed in greater detail, for the fundamental understanding of the electromigration degradation mechanisms, as well as for the industry critical assessment methodologies of electromigration device lifetime. The technique can also be used to provide the key tool to probe the plastic behavior of the materials at small scales under the mechanical load. Understanding and controlling plasticity and the mechanical properties of materials on this scale could thus lead to new and more robust nanomechanical structures and devices. © 2015, The Author(s).","Cu interconnect; Electromigration; Plasticity; Size effect; Small scale; Strain gradient; Stress gradient; Synchrotron; μXRD","Degradation; Electromigration; Plasticity; Synchrotrons; Cu interconnect; Size effects; Small scale; Strain gradients; Stress gradient; Mechanical properties",,,,,,,"Valek, B.C., Bravman, J.C., Tamura, N., Electromigration-induced plastic deformation in passivated metal lines (2002) Appl Phys Lett, 81, pp. 4168-4170; Arzt, E., Size effects in materials due to microstructural and dimensional constraints: A comparative review (1998) Acta Mater, 46, pp. 5611-5626; Keller, R.M., Baker, S.P., Arzt, E., Quantitative analysis of strengthening mechanisms in thin Cu films: Effects of film thickness, grain size, and passivation (1998) J Mater Res, 13, pp. 1307-1317; Yu, Y.W., Spaepen, F., The yield strength of thin copper films on Kapton (2003) J Appl Phys, 95, pp. 2991-2997; Kraft, O., Hommel, M., Deformation behavior of thin copper films on deformable substrates (2001) Acta Mater, 49, pp. 3935-3947; Huang, H., Spaepen, F., Tensile testing of free-standing Cu, Ag and Al thin films and Ag/ Cu multilayers (2000) Acta Mater, 48, pp. 3261-3269; Nix, W.D., Mechanical properties of thin films (1989) Metall Trans A, 20, pp. 2217-2245; Nix, W.D., Yielding and strain hardening of thin metal films on substrates (1998) Sci Mater, 39, pp. 545-554; Von Blanckenhagen, B., Gumbsch, P., Arzt, E., Dislocation sources and the flow stress of polycrystalline thin metal films (2003) Phil Mag Lett, 83, pp. 1-8; Arzt, E., Dehm, G., Gumbsch, P., Interface controlled plasticity in metals: Dispersion hardening and thin film deformation (2001) Prog Mater Sci, 46, pp. 283-307; Nix, W.D., Leung, O.S., Thin films: Plasticity (2001) Encyclopedia of Materials: Science and Technology, 9262p. , In: Buschow KHJ et al, Elsevier, Oxford; Han, S.M., Philips, M.A., Nix, W.D., Study of strain softening behavior of Al-Al3 Sc multilayers using microcompression testing (2009) Acta Mat, 57, pp. 4473-4490; Pant, P., Schwartz, K.W., Baker, S.P., Dislocation interactions in thin FCC metal films (2003) Acta Mater, 51, pp. 3243-3258; Nix, W.D., Greer, J.R., Feng, G., Deformation at the nanometer and micrometer length scales: Effects of strain gradients and dislocation starvation (2007) Thin Solid Films, 515, pp. 3152-3157; Stelmashenko, N.A., Walls, M.G., Brown, L.M., Microindentations on W and Mo oriented single crystals: An STM study (1993) Acta Metall Mater, 41, pp. 2855-2865; De Guzman, M.S., Neubauer, G., Flinn, P., The role of indentation depth on the measured hardness of materials (1993) Mater Res Soc Proc, 308, 613p; Ma, Q., Clarke, D.R., Size dependent hardness of silver single crystals (1995) J Mat Res, 10, pp. 853-863; Poole, W.J., Ashby, M.F., Fleck, N.A., Micro-hardness of annealed and work-hardened copper polycrystals (1996) Scripta Mat, 34, pp. 559-564; Nix, W.D., Gao, H., Micro-hardness of annealed and work-hardened copper polycrystals (1998) J Mech Phys Solids, 46, pp. 411-425; Gao, H., Huang, Y., Nix, W.D., Modeling plasticity at the micrometer scale (1999) Naturwissenschaftler, 86, 507p; Gao, H., Huang, W.D., Nix, J.W., Mechanism-based strain gradient plasticity-I.

Two main diffusion paths are compared: grain boundaries and electromigration induced dislocations. The electromigration induced dislocations are formed due to the crystal bending, described in the previous chapters, and form a short diffusion path in the direction of the current. These two possible diffusion paths can lead to the significantly different device failure time dependence on the current density. This can lead to an important implication for the way device lifetime/reliability is assessed. © 2015, The Author(s).","Diffusion path; Electromigration; Electron wind; Interconnect; Reliability","Diffusion; Dislocations (crystals); Grain boundaries; Integrated circuit interconnects; Phase equilibria; Plasticity; Reliability; Cu-interconnects; Device failures; Device lifetime; Diffusion paths; Electron wind; Induced dislocation; Interconnect; Electromigration",,,,,,,"Budiman, A.S., Hau-Riege, C.S., Besser, P.R., Plasticity-amplified diffusivity: Dislocation cores as fast diffusion paths in Cu interconnects (2007) 45Th Annual IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings, , Phoenix, 15-19 Apr 2007; Budiman, A.S., Tamura, N., Valek, B.C., Crystal plasticity in Cu damascene interconnect lines undergoing electromigration as revealed by synchrotron X-ray microdiffraction (2006) Appl Phys Lett, 88, pp. 233-515; Budiman, A.S., Tamura, N., Valek, B.C., Electromigration-induced plastic deformation in Cu damascene interconnect lines as revealed by synchrotron X-ray microdiffraction (2006) Mat Res Soc Proc, 914p; Valek, B.C., Bravman, J.C., Tamura, N., Electromigration-induced plastic deformation in passivated metal lines (2002) Appl Phys Lett, 81, pp. 4168-4170; Valek, B.C., Tamura, N., Spolenak, R., Early stage of plastic deformation in thin films undergoing electromigration (2003) J Appl Phys, 94, pp. 3757-3761; Tamura, N., Macdowell, A.A., Spolenak, B.C., Scanning X-ray microdiffraction with submicrometer white beam for strain/stress and orientation mapping in thin films (2003) J Synchrotron Radiat, 10, pp. 137-143; Baker, S.P., Joo, Y.C., Knaub, M.P., Electromigration damage in mechanically deformed Al conductor lines: Dislocations as fast diffusion paths (2000) Acta Mater, 48, pp. 2199-2208; Frost, H.J., Ashby, M.F., (1982) Deformation-Mechanism Maps: The Plasticity and Creep of Metals and Ceramics, , Pergamon Press, Oxford; Suo, Z., Electromigration-induced dislocation climb and multiplication in conducting lines (1994) Acta Metall Mater, 42, pp. 3581-3588; Oates, A.S., Electromigration transport mechanisms in al thin-film conductors (1996) J Appl Phys, 79, pp. 163-169; Black, J.R., Mass transport of aluminum by momentum exchange with conducting electrons (1967) In: 6Th Annual IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceeding, , Los Angeles, 6-8 Nov 1967; Kirchheim, R., Kaeber, U., Atomistic and computer modeling of metallization failure of integrated circuits by electromigration (1991) J Appl Phys, 70, pp. 172-181; Korhonen, M.A., Borgesen, P., Tu, K.N., Stress evolution due to electromigration in confined metal lines (1993) J Appl Phys, 73, pp. 3790-3799; Lloyd, J.R., Electromigration failure (1991) J Appl Phys, 69, 7601p; Hau-Riege, C.S., Marathe, A.P., Pham, V., (2002) The Effect of Line Length on the Electromigration Reliability of Cu Interconnects, 169. , In: Proceedings of the advanced metallization conference; Schafft, H.A., Grant, T.C., Saxena, A.N., (1985) Electromigration and the Current Density Dependence, , In: Reliability physics symposium, Orlando; Sigsbee, R.A., Electromigration and metalization lifetimes (1973) J Appl Phys, 44, pp. 2533-2540; Bobbio, A., Saracco, O., A modified reliability expression for the electromigration timeto-failure (1975) Micoelectron Reliab, 14, pp. 431-433; Gan, D., Ho, P.S., Pang, Y., Effect of passivation on stress relaxation in electroplated copper films (2006) J Mater Res, 21, pp. 1512-1518; Cai, B., Kong, Q.P., Lu, L., Interface controlled diffusional creep of nanocrystalline pure copper (1999) Scripta Mater, 41, pp. 755-759; Dickenscheid, W., Birringer, R., Gleiter, H., Investigation of self-diffusion in nanocrystalline copper by NMR (1991) Solid State Commun, 79, pp. 683-686; Zschech, E., Meyer, M.A., Langer, E., Effect of mass transport along interfaces and grain boundaries on copper interconnect degradation (2004) MRS Proceedings, San Francisco, , 12-16 Apr 2004","Budiman, A.S.; Singapore University of Technology and DesignSingapore; email: suriadi@alumni.stanford.edu",,,"Springer Verlag",,,,,2191530X,,,,"English","SpringerBriefs Appl.

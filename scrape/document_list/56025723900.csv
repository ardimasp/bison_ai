The Original Palatable Eating Motives Scale (PEMS) was translated into Indonesian and back-translated into English to confirm the conceptual and linguistic equivalence. The scale was administered to emerging adults aged 18-25 years old. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the I-PEMS has an acceptable factor structure. The result provided evidence of four factors of palatable eating motives. No significant difference from the I-PEMS score between males and females. The association was only observed between the scores of Conformity motive and Body Mass Index. © 2020 Cahyani et al.","Body mass index; Construct validity; Factor analysis; Motivation; Palatable eating; Psychometric","adult; body mass; confirmatory factor analysis; construct validity; controlled study; eating; female; human; Indonesian; letter; male; motivation; young adult",,,,,,"Blundell, J.E., Finlayson, G., Is susceptibility to weight gain characterized by homeostatic or hedonic risk factors for overconsumption?

The ability to control ourselves not eating emotionally is a crucial aspect for our health. We present a simple and novel approach for detecting physical or emotional hunger using Bayesian belief networks and psychological aspects. A novel approach is proposed where the user asks whether he/she is thirsty, then some action should be done such as drinking and answering some questions, and the result and suggestion are then displayed. Bayesian belief networks use 3 nodes: thirsty, mood and social media to improve the accuracy of hunger prediction. A hunger and discovery scale concept as parameter of the output is used. This Android app is very useful for people to avoid emotional hunger. Based on the experiment, concept of physical and emotional hunger can apply the application able to show the prediction of his/her hunger. © 2017 ICIC International.","Bayesian belief network; Emotional eating; Hunger detection; Intuitive eating",,,,,"Binus University","The authors wish to thank to BINUS University for supporting this research.

Previously, humanoid robot focused on the architecture of body and ethical issues, but later, it is predicted that humanoid robots should consider teaching behaviour, student's interest and speech understanding. They are expected to conclude the answer through conversation under noisy environment. We propose speech recognition systems based on Google translator and basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as stemming and tokenization. We do teach modules for elementary school in order that the robot can interact with students naturally based on psychological aspects. We also discuss about our recent humanoid robot for education in elementary school that has ability to detect user's face and accepts commands in sentences from the user to do any actions such as giving tutorial and answering questions. The average accuracy for correct recognition is 73.3% and correct answer is 63.3%. Our speech recognition system is more promising compared with NAO robot. © 2017 The Authors.

Usually, consumer will do a strategy to coping the confusion, that strategy is known as Confusion Reduction Strategy. The conventional ways usually taken by the consumer to reduce the confusion are, such as: Asking for product recommendation to close relatives, seeking for an additional product information on the internet and so on. However, suggestions and recommendations from conventional sources obtained by the consumer, sometimes are not always accurate (not objective) and time consuming (inefficient). Therefore, this research proposes a Decision Support System (DSS) application to cope with the confusion. In this study, the comparison results between conventional methods (such as: Asking advice to close relatives or seeking for an additional information on the internet) with the proposed method (the DSS) were presented. In addition, another implication of this study is to get the factors that causing consumer confusion in case of smartphone purchases. This research used mixed-method approach, implemented through interview and survey. Research samples were 136 potential smartphone buyers which are converted to 27 smartphone buyers; brand image is the main source of consumer confusion (mean 3.98, std. dev 0.86), followed by proliferation of brands, services and models of smartphone products (mean 3.89, std. dev 0.82). Respondents often use Word of Mouth (WoM) communication as main source of information to reduce the confusion, results of 16 from 27 transactions were contributed from WoM. DSS application contributed only 2 of 27 smartphone transactions. Further research for the development of mobile based DSS application as an alternative conventional CRS needs to be conducted, because of the potential success of static desktop based DSS application in reducing potential consumer confusion especially for value oriented buyers. © 2014 Science Publication.","Confusion Reduction Strategy; Consumer Confusion; Decision Support System; Fuzzy Logic; Simple Additive Weighting",,,,,,,"Afshari, A., Mojahed, M., Yusuff, R.M., Simple additive weighting approach to personnel selection problem (2010) Int.

In this situation the phenomenon of ""buying a pig in a poke"" is very possible to occur. Moreover, the customer feels disapointed when the book she/he purchases is unavailable.

Where, the Tablet PCs was a product that transforming from the minimization of notebook computer. In other words, it can be said as a handheld device that has an 'almost' similar performance as a notebook computer but has a more compact and smaller size dimension than the notebook computers and has a bigger dimension than the smart-phones also. The problem is there were so many variations of Tablet PCs products on the market. Therefore, the question often arises about the Tablet PCs is, ""which one the most-suitable product for my purposes""? In this study modeled a simulation process for Tablet PCs selection using the eight domains of weighting criteria. Which from our perspective these eight domains of weighting criteria are an 'objective' measurement for assessing the Tablet PCs products. As a decision support tool that implementing a method of Multi-Attribute Decision Making (MADM) technique using Weighted-Product (WP) algorithm approach, where WP serves a means to give product recommendations to the users about the most-suitable products for them based on priority ranking mechanism. © 2014 Robertus Nugroho Perwiro Atmojo, Anggita Dian Cahyani, Yulius Lie.","Decision support systems; Multi attribute decision making (MADM); Simulation modeling; Tablet PCs selection; Weighted-Product algorithm; Weighting criteria",,,,,,,"Awasthi, A., Chauhan, S.S., Goyal, S.K., A multi-criteria decision making approach for location planning for urban distribution centers under uncertainty (2011) Mathematical and Computer Modelling, 53, pp. 98-109; Shahraki, A., Zarea, H., Jannesari, A., Decision making with multi criteria through hierarchic analysis technique and its effect on customer decision procedure (2012) Information Management and Business Review, 4 (3), pp. 153-158; Székely, A., Talanow, R., Bágyi, P., Smartphones, tablets and mobile applications for radiology (2013) European Journal of Radiology, 82, pp. 829-836; Feng, B., Lai, F., Multi-attribute group decision making with aspirations: A case study (2014) Omega, 44, pp. 136-147; Bolt Super 4G LTE (2013), http://www.boltsuper4g.com, PT.

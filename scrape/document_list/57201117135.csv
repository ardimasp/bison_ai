The data for this study is collected using survey technique. The total number of respondents for this study were 94 people, which all of them are game players with the minimum age of 15 years old. The experiment results show that our model can predict Openness, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness personality traits from the game character design selected before playing games with the average accuracy of 66.7%. © 2017 IEEE.","artificial neural network; game character design; machine learning; ocean; personality prediction","Forecasting; Internet of things; Neural networks; Character designs; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning models; ocean; Personality predictions; Personality traits; Prediction-based; Survey techniques; Learning systems",,,,,"John, O.P., Srivastava, S., The big five trait taxonomy: History, measurement, and theoretical perspectives (1999) Handb.

This paper's aim is to introduce the more interesting and interactive way to introduce Tais. Utilization of Augmented Reality (AR) technology in an application built with the Unity3D program is done to provide different way in presenting interesting and interactive information to its users. Based on the results in this paper, the developed application can handle the presentation in more interesting and interactive way. The ideal distance in the tracking process for target objects with size 7 x 6 cm is ranged from 6 cm to 30 cm, with the image ratio that can be detected at the farthest distance is 4% of the camera image. For the detection angle, the target object can be detected properly from approximately ±640. From the data acquired, it can be said that AR can be used to introduce Tais in more interesting and interactive way. © 2018 The Authors.

This paper surveys some analysis of gamification models. MDA framework is used to identify surveyed papers by breaking them down into three categories: mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics. Findings from the survey show there are many gamification models in education domain. However, there are some very representative gamification models could be used as a method to increase motivation, achievement and engagement in learning activities. By knowing the latest gamification models in education domain stated in this paper, it could help gamification practitioners to make new strategies in learning activities to increase students' motivation, achievement and involvement. We also suggest some gamification strategies, which combine several mechanics in such a way to create dynamics that results in all types of aesthetics outputs. © 2018 The Authors.

In terms of purpose, game has two types, which is serious game and non-serious game. As learning media, serious games need to have ability to motivate its player in order to play the game until the end so the player can finish the game while understanding learning materials given in the game. Therefore, the quality of serious game should be measured, like any other software. When it comes to measure serious games, previous models can't do the job well since all of them have no way to measure the game's content, especially to measure the content that can improve player's motivation. This paper proposes a new game measurement metric to measure the game quality factors, especially to measure serious game contents that can motivate its players. The result of this paper is a metric table consisted of measureable factors and type of test to measure them. © 2017 IEEE.","Motivational factors; Quality factors; Quality measurement; Quality metric; Serious games","Computer games; Human computer interaction; Game contents; Learning materials; Learning media; Motivational factors; Quality factors; Quality measurements; Quality metrices; Video game; Serious games",,,,,"Trisnadoli, A., Hendradjaya, B., Sunindyo, W.D., A proposal of quality model for mobile games (2015) 5th Int.

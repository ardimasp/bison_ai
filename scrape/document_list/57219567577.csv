Integration of technology with business processes become a crucial part as evidence of whether the technology will be applied may run in conjunction with the organization's business. Collaboration built an organization with System Integrators as partners in supporting the process is important, because the system Integrator with a portfolio that they must provide solutions and strategies to look at the needs of the organization to minimize the problems that result in business processes that are running on the organization. Qualified human resources is a key from System Integrator providing best services to the organization. Using the Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method this study aims to build an engineer selection information system. Adopting the concept of a decision-making system, this system proved to be far more effective in selecting engineers according to established criteria. © 2020 IEEE.","Decision support system; Engineer selection; Simple additive weighting","Additives; Decision making; Information management; Business Process; Decision-making systems; Simple additive weighting; System integrators; Engineers",,,,,"Afshari, A., Mojahed, M., Yusuff, R.M., (2010) Simple Additive Weighting Approachto Personnel Selection Problem, pp. 1-5; Dede, P.W., Punggara, A.A., Comparison analysis of simple additive weighting (SAW) and weigthed product (WP) (2018) Decision Support Systems, pp. 1-5; Mu, E., Pereyra-Rojas, M., Practical decision making (2017) An Introduction to the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) Using Super Decision v2.

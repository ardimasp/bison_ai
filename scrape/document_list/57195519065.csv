This means that there is already a preference for Internet users in terms of using devices from PC and laptop computers to mobile devices. With the development of technology and the transition to mobile, the education sector is also experiencing a change from face-to-face in the classroom (conventional) to online learning. The researcher proposes a prototype of a mobile-based online learning management system (m-LMS) that will be used and adopted by students and lecturers at the nursing academy. The study aims to determine the preferences of prospective nurses in using smartphone devices as m-learning media and specific needs in m-learning learning situations, as well as their opinions on the appropriateness of learning through smartphones. Retrieval of data using interview techniques to students and lecturers at the nursing academy. The sampling technique of this study used simple random sampling. The results obtained were enthusiastic nursing students with online learning via smartphones and the feature most wanted by students was the availability of learning material that could be downloaded and read whenever they needed.

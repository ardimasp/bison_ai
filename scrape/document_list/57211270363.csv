Some of them have their own Wi-Fi devices. This causes a problem for Wi-Fi connection. If the tenants have some devices operating on 2.4 GHz wave, it can cause signal interference that can affect the stability of Wi-Fi connection. Full Wi-Fi network evaluation is required at Pacific Place Jakarta in terms of signal performance and availability. In this paper, we analyze the current existing network using some network monitoring tools and we propose a solution based on capacity requirement that can be used to improve Wi-Fi performance. The solution is to arrange a 2.4 GHz channel configuration to minimize interference and output power settings. Simulation results show that there is an improvement in download and upload speed after the solution is implemented. The results also indicate the channel usage decrease of the 2.4 GHz channel and the surrounding noise floor level. © 2019 IEEE.","channel usage; noise floor; throughput; Wi-Fi network","Floors; Information management; Throughput; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Capacity requirement; Channel configuration; Channel usages; Network monitoring tools; Noise floor; Signal performance; Wi Fi networks; Wi-Fi connections; Wi-Fi",,,,"Binus University","This paper is supported by Bina Nusantara University","De Vries, J.P., Simi, L., Achtzehn, A., Petrova, M., Mähönen, P., The Wi-Fi 'congestion crisis': Regulatory criteria for assessing spectrum congestion claims (2014) Telecomm.

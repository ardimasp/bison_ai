The methods may vary for each university, but most of the modern universities today use a Learning Management Systems (LMS). The LMS application is widely used by the lecturers and students of Bina Nusantara University called BINUMAYA. The system was originally created as a website application, but now its mobile version is also available and is widely used by amongst the students and the lecturers. However, the existing student version of the mobile application have two separate applications, that function almost identically with the official BINUMAYA system. We are interested in finding out the students' perceptions about the two applications. Therefore, we ran a user survey on BINUS students that were randomly selected by convenience sampling. Respondents were asked several questions related to performance, trustworthiness and preferability using the applications. The data collected was analysed using the two mean difference tests for each variable. Our findings showed that the students have a few reasons on why they prefer to choose one application compared to the other and, why they only trust the information presented by the official mobile LMS. © 2020 IEEE.","E-Learning; Learning Management System; Mobile LMS; Student Preference","Information management; Students; Learning management system; Mean difference test; Mobile applications; Mobile Learning; User surveys; Learning systems",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

Taking care in the wrong way will make teeth broken and cause many teeth problem. Expert system is a system which is built to solve problem for user in certain field. This research aims to design an expert system-based application to assist someone to know their level of knowledge in taking care of teeth. Through this application, user could know how to take care of teeth so then they could minimize the teeth problem. © 2015 SERSC.","ECLIPSE; Expert system; Measurement; Teeth treatment",,,,,,"Turban, E., Decision Support and Expert Systems: Management Support Systems (1995), (4th Edition).

In supply chain management, where suppliers and customers involved, it is important to have a comprehensive and aligned performance measurement system. The study is based on a multinational pharmaceutical company in Indonesia. It aims to refine the performance measurement system (PMS) for its export department. The export activities involve multiple logistic service providers as their suppliers and several inter-market customers. The PMS is done based on balanced score card (BSC) concept. The study gives practical approach on implementation of PMS in middle and part of organisation, aligning its internal needs and external environment, without losing BSC integrity. A tracking tool is also developed to assist in measuring and monitoring the KPIs. © Copyright 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Balanced score card; BSC; KPI; Performance management system; Tracking tool",,,,,,"Aitken, M., Machin, C., Troein, P., (2014) Understanding the Pharmaceutical Value Chain, , USA; Bhagwat, R., Sharma, M.K., Performance measurement of supply chain management: A balanced scorecard approach (2007) Computers and Industrial Engineering, 53 (1), pp. 43-62; Bulsara, H.P., Qureshi, M.N., Patel, H., Supply chain performance measurement - An exploratory study (2014) Int.

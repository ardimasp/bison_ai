(2) Rate of change, customers request more frequent release cycles to compensate for changes in information and service requirements. (3) Quality of change, Increased application scalability. For that reason, IT organizations in making business changes need to do what needs to be modular in developing applications and deployments. Architectural Microservices (MSA) is an alternative architecture in building an application. The MSA conversion process can start patterns that are adapted to future needs. The release cycle is carried out by implementing automation for continuous delivery and continuous integration into continuous development, transforming data services into service forms, so as to answer the challenges of digital transformation. In this paper explains how to transform architects and their design in the E-Procurement application system using MSA. © BEIESP.","And E-Procurement; Architecture; Cloud Computing; Microservices; SOA",,,,,,"Overcoming Ongoing Digital Transformational Challenges with a Microservices Architecture (2015) Cogniz, pp. 1-9. , 20-20 Insights, no. november; (2019) Microservices, , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices; Lestari, W.P., Sujarwo, A., DevOps: Disrupsi Pengelolaan ICT Pendidikan Tinggi (2018) Semin.

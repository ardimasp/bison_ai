So, purchase or purchase intention has become an indicator of e-commerce performance. Previous research showed that there are several factors that can influence the level of purchase intention in e-commerce. This preliminary research used Sequential Equation Modeling (SEM). Data of 51 respondents was collected in May 2020 using Purposive sampling with respondents who are e-commerce buyers in Jabodetabek region in Indonesia. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of Perceived of Ease, Perceived of Risk, Transaction Attitude, Visual Merchandising, and Trust to Company on Purchase Intention in the e-commerce of active e-commerce users. Transaction Attitude and Visual Merchandising will become special variables which affect the Purchase Intention directly or indirectly. The result found that there are two hypotheses that are not significant: Perceived of Ease to Transaction Attitude and Trust to Company to Transaction Attitude. This research contributes to e-commerce sellers, buyers, government (in order to make regulations), and Information Systmems knowledge update. © 2020 IEEE.","Intention to purchase e-commerce; Perceived of ease; Perceived of risk; Transaction attitude; Trust to company; Visual merchandising","Electronic commerce; Information management; Purchasing; Indonesia; Knowledge update; Purchase intention; Sequential equation modeling; Sales",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

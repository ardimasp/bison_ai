Online marketplace application as a popular variety of e-commerce, also following this trend to implement gamification elements in their application to create a better buying experience for their users and to increase the brand loyalty of their users towards various online marketplace applications.

Most people do not realize they have heart disease until it is too late. Some parameters can be used to predict it, such as chest pain type, age, sex; fasting blood sugar; maximum heart rate. In this paper, using Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), a prediction of heart disease classification is presented. The results show that our proposed data mining technique using Naive Bayes can predict as high as 86% accuracy outperforming the previous works. Besides, Naïve Bayes is the best model in this study since it has the best values in terms of precision, accuracy, and specificity compared to other models. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Analytics include the ability to get different point of view from data by manipulating the data using statistics, mathematics, economics, simulations, optimizations, or other techniques that will enhance decision making of business organizations. BD is led by the widespread use of digital technologies in companies in various sectors, including Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company. The amount of data produced and communicated in is piled up everyday. Data in database include items sold, store inventory, and warehouse inventory of retail partner for specific stock keeping units (SKUs) produced by the manufacturer. These records called Point-of-Sale (POS) data. In modern days dynamic consumer markets, supply chains need to be value driven and consumer oriented. Demand planning allows supply chain members to focus on the consumer and create optimal value. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

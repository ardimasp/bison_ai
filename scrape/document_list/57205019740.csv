In most university, management must be able to collect all hundreds of proposals and reports; not to mention they must be able to accommodate the process of reviewing every single proposal. They also need to monitor all research output in final report and make sure that all of the outputs are correctly achieved from proposed target. In addition to the problems stated, previous activities are done manually, leaving a lot of opportunity to improve and automate the process. All of the addressable opportunity for improvement are explained and explored, thus a model of the web application is created. This paper presents the design of web application used to solve persistent problem in research management, specifically in Binus University. The design methodology is divided into two phases: requirement engineering phase, and system design. Upon finishing the requirement engineering phase, system model is depicted using Unified Modeling Language, specifically: Activity Diagram, Use Case Diagram, and Conceptual Class Diagram. © 2018 IEEE.","higher education; research management system; unified modeling language","Information management; Systems analysis; Telecommunication services; Unified Modeling Language; Design Methodology; Design of web applications; Higher education; Requirement engineering; Research activities; Research management; Research management systems; Research outputs; Design",,,,,"Braddock, R., Neave, G., Research management in higher education: Overview and conclusion of a debate (2002) Higher Education Policy, 15 (3), pp. 313-330; Shon, H.S., Han, S.H., Kim, K.A., Cha, E.J., Ryu, K.H., Proposal reviewer recommendation system based on big data for a national research management institute (2017) Journal of Information Science, 43 (2), pp. 147-158; Lu, R., (2016) University Teaching and Research and Scientific Research Performance Quantitative Statistics System; Morgan, A., Duffield, N., Walkley Hall, L., Research data management support: Sharing our experiences (2017) Journal of the Australian Library and Information Association, 66 (3), pp. 299-305; Liu, Y., Yao, Y., Zhang, X., Liu, B., Ding, C., Design of research management system based on workflow and rapid development platform technology (2015) Estimation, Detection and Information Fusion (ICEDIF), 2015 International Conference on, pp. 329-334. , IEEE, January; Morales, M.P.E., Abulon, E.L.R., Ermita, R.C., David, A.P., Organizing and systematizing knowledge management through an automated university-based research Portal (2017) Asia Pacific Journal of Multidisciplinary Research, 5, p. 3; Pressman, R.S., Software engineering-A practitioners approach (2015) Mc Graw-Hill International Edition, 2010; Matthias, R., Tools & Techniques Expert Opinion, Online, , http://www.idemployee.id.tue.nl/g.w.m.rauterberg/lecturenotes/UFTexp.ertopinion.pdf; Rumbaugh, J., Booch, G., Jacobson, I., (2017) The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual, , Addison Wesley; Dumas, M., Ter Hofstede, A.H., UML activity diagrams as a workflow specification language (2001) International Conference on the Unified Modeling Language, pp. 76-90. , Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, October; Jena, A.K., Swain, S.K., Mohapatra, D.P., A novel approach for test case generation from UML activity diagram (2014) Issues and Challenges in Intelligent Computing Techniques (ICICT), 2014 International Conference on, pp. 621-629. , IEEE, February; Ikram, M.T., Butt, N.A., Hussain, A., Nadeem, A., Testing from uml design using activity diagram: A comparison of techniques (2015) International Journal of Computer Applications, 131, p. 5; Seidl, M., Scholz, M., Huemer, C., Kappel, G., The use case diagram (2015) UML@ Classroom, pp. 23-47. , Springer, Cham",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2018","3 September 2018 through 5 September 2018",,142373,,9781538658215,,,"English","Proc.

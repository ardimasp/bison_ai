Self-efficacy and career aspirations is seen as having an influence on career success. A discriminant analysis was performed to test whether academic achievement, self-efficacy, and career aspirations could be used as predictors to differentiate between a person who was successful and a person who was less so in their career, especially in the early years of employment. More successful people had a tendency for Pure Challenge by which is meant that the person is able to overcome challenges and a readiness to take charge. Lifestyle aspiration is also seen as important in career development. And the last aspiration was Entrepreneurship, indicating that a more successful person usually wanted to build something and take charge. The findings of this research support the claim that academic achievement was not the only factor which contributed to career success. Self-efficacy, and career aspirations play a role in the career success.","Academic achievement; Career aspirations; Career success; Generation Y; Self-efficacy; Training and development",,,,,,"Abele, A., Wiese, B., The nomological network of self-management strategies and career success (2008) Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 73, pp. 490-497; Bandura, A., (1994) Encyclopedia of Human Behavior, 4, pp. 71-81. , Self-Efficacy.

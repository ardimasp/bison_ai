Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on the relational view of resource-based theory to propose a theoretical model. The data were collected through survey of 145 service firms. Findings: The results of this study found that the Big Data analytics has a positive and significant relationship with a firm’s ability to manage data security and a positive impact on service supply chain innovation capabilities and service supply chain performance. This study also found that most service firms participating in this study used Big Data analytics to execute existing algorithms faster with larger data sets. Practical implications: A main recommendation of this study is that service firms empower a chief data officer to establish the data needed and design the governance of data in the company to eliminate any security issues. Data security was a concern if a firm did not have ample data governance and protection as the information was shared among members of service supply chain networks. Originality/value: Big Data analytics are a useful technology tool to forecast market preference based on open source, structured and unstructured data. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big Data analytics; Data security; Malaysia; Service supply chain; Services supply chain performance; Supply chain innovation capabilities",,,,,,"Acar, A.Z., Uzunlar, M.B., The effects of process development and information technology on time-based supply chain performance (2014) Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences, 150 (1), pp. 744-753; Addo-Tenkorang, R., Helo, P.T., Big data applications in operations/supply-chain management: a literature review (2016) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 101 (1), pp. 528-543; Agarwal, R., Weill, P., The benefits of combining data with empathy (2012) MIT Sloan Management Review, 54 (1), pp. 1-35; Angkiriwang, R., Pujawan, I.N., Santosa, B., Managing uncertainty through supply chain flexibility: reactive vs proactive approaches (2014) Production & Manufacturing Research, 2 (1), pp. 50-70; Arlbjørn, J.S., Freytag, P.V., Haas, H.D., Service supply chain management: a survey of lean application in the municipal sector (2011) International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 41 (3), pp. 277-295; Arunachalam, D., Kumar, N., Kawalek, J.P., Understanding big data analytics capabilities in supply chain management: unravelling the issues, challenges and implications for practice (2017) Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 114, pp. 416-436; Arya, V., Sharma, P., Singh, A., De Silva, P.T.M., An exploratory study on supply chain analytics applied to spare parts supply chain (2017) Benchmarking: An International Journal, 24 (6), pp. 1571-1580; Assunção, M.D., Calheiros, R.N., Bianchi, S., Netto, M.A., Buyya, R., Big data computing and clouds: trends and future directions (2015) Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, 79 (1), pp. 3-15; Balfaqih, H., Nopiah, Z.M., Saibani, N., Al-Nory, M.T., Review of supply chain performance measurement systems: 1998–2015 (2016) Computers in Industry, 82 (1), pp. 135-150; Baltacioglu, T., Ada, E., Kaplan, M.D., Yurt, O.A., Cem Kaplan, Y., A new framework for service supply chains (2007) The Service Industries Journal, 27 (2), pp. 105-124; Barney, J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Bendle, N.T., Wang, X.S., Uncovering the message from the mess of big data (2016) Business Horizons, 59 (1), pp. 115-124; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data: provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Cameron, K.S., Quinn, R.E., An introduction to changing organizational culture (1999) Diagnosing and Changing Organizational Culture: Based on the Competing Values Framework, pp. 1-17; Capó-Vicedo, J., Mula, J., Capó, J., A social network-based organizational model for improving knowledge management in supply chains (2011) Supply Chain Management: An International Journal, 16 (4), pp. 284-293; Chang, V., Wills, G., A model to compare cloud and non-cloud storage of Big Data (2016) Future Generation Computer Systems, 57, pp. 56-76; Chen, D.Q., Preston, D.S., Swink, M., How the use of big data analytics affects value creation in supply chain management (2015) Journal of Management Information Systems, 32 (4), pp. 4-39; Cheng, S., Shi, Y., Qin, Q., Bai, R., Swarm intelligence in big data analytics (2013) International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning, Springer, pp. 417-426. , Berlin and Heidelberg; Cho, D.W., Lee, Y.H., Ahn, S.H., Hwang, M.K., A framework for measuring the performance of service supply chain management (2012) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 62 (3), pp. 801-818; Chong, A.Y., Chan, F.T., Ooi, K.B., Sim, J.J., Can Malaysian firms improve organizational/innovation performance via SCM?

Previous literature is reviewed to identify the issues of fair value accounting from Islamic perspective. In this paper, the reliable and objective issues, gharar issue, unethical issue, zakah issue and three-tier hierarchy issue are discussed in FVA. In order to avoid Shari'ah issues in accounting measurement, the valuation basis used for the measurement of assets and liabilities should consider the types and the nature of assets and liabilities. Moreover, accountants in doing their professional duties are required to have the code of ethics based on Holy Quran and Shari'ah principles in order to get paramount rewards from Allah SWT in the hereafter. Therefore, the discussion of Shari'ah issues in this paper is expected to be useful as a sharing knowledge of the matters and challenges faced by Muslims when dealing with FVA.

The statistical results indicated that three dimensions constructs of reverse logistics: (1) remanufacturing; (2) material recycling; (3) green disposal have a significant and positive relation with the ability of firms to control costs. The firms need to practice green operations and sustainability orientation activities to maintain lower costs, improve the quality of products, stakeholders' well-being and lower carbon footprint for greener environments.

This study used departmental managers or district managers who were drawn at random from the directory of the Indonesian Directorate General of Civil Aviation (IDGCA), and the researchers conducted critical-incident interviews with 23 of them. These respondents described a total of 163 useable incidents, giving accounts of positive and negative internal evaluations of service quality drawn from these incidents. Based on retrospective interviews and, after the incidents had been categorized, the study found that domain constructs of ISQ included human factors, process, punctuality, sales and marketing and safety. The managers' first-hand experiences helped clarify the domain constructs of ISQ in the LCC setting. By using internal service evaluations, management can assess the quality of service periodically and of safety awareness. These efforts could not only improve the reliability and quality of a company's services but also allow management to diagnose service errors through important components of service quality specifically defined for the airline business. The results of this study could be used to help improve current service quality internally. The ISQ results suggest practical actions for improvements that provide guidance to management, which can be achieved by the using the internal service evaluation technique to increase passengers' confidence in local air operators.

We argue that the game designed meticulously tailored with the learning subjects can increase the pupils' interest in learning, prevent boredom, and increase the curiosity of the students towards the learning subjects, in this case: Mathematics. The game design method proposed in this research is to combine the Six Facets of Serious Game Design and Ernest Adams' Game Design. The results show that the students that implement the serious game design as their learning tools were statistically performed better than the one who only use traditional learning tools. © 2020 ICIC International.","Game design; Learning tools; Mathematics; Serious game design",,,,,,"Chowanda, A., Prasetio, Y.

Social problems have been an interesting subject to talk, discuss, and debate in all around the world. This due to the wave of change and shift in the population cohort, and influence the behaviour differences within population cohort, causing a plenty of social problems in the world. Research shown that in Indonesia, social problem is one of the highlight in the society nowadays. Hence, this research is aiming to contribute to a design of a serious game teach social critique to adults, and the evaluations of the serious game design for social problems. The results demonstrate the participants rated that they are happy with the game. Moreover, from the questionnaire, the average score for all items is 3,968, and the highest score belongs to Q6 (4,223), while the lowest score belongs to Q4 (3,800). Moreover, 81% of the players got the right messages about social critique to the society. Finally, the short interview shows the participants felt that the experience when playing the game empower them to get right messages about social critique to the society, where 90% agreed they have gained knowledge and awareness regarding to Narcotics Psychotropic and Addictive Substance and culture of littering arise in the Indonesia. © 2018 The Author(s).","First Person View; Horror; Myth; Serious Game; Social Critique","Artificial intelligence; First person; Horror; Indonesia; Myth; Social Critique; Social problems; Serious games",,,,,"Piper, A.M., O'Brien, E., Morris, M.R., Winograd, T., Sides: A cooperative tabletop computer game for social skills development (2006) Proceedings of the 2006 20th Anniversary Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, pp. 1-10. , ACM; Fields, T., Cotton, B., (2011) Social Game Design: Monetization Methods and Mechanics, , CRC Press; Yamakami, T., Time management in mobile social game design: Lessons from mobile social games in japan (2011) Network-Based Information Systems (NBiS), 2011 14th International Conference on, pp. 413-418. , IEEE; Chowanda, A., Prasetio, Y., (2012) Perancangan Game Edukasi Bertemakan Sejarah Indonesia Ken Arok Dan Buto Ijo, p. 2. , Binus University; Bourdieu, P., (2013) Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, , Routledge; Smith, D.E., (1999) Writing the Social: Critique, Theory, and Investigations, , University of Toronto Press; Sudarmadi, S., Suzuki, S., Kawada, T., Netti, H., Soemantri, S., Tugaswati, A.T., A survey of perception, knowledge, awareness, and attitude in regard to environmental problems in a sample of two different social groups in jakarta, indonesia (2001) Environment, Development and Sustainability, 3 (2), pp. 169-183; Squire, K.D., Jan, M., Mad city mystery: Developing scientific argumentation skills with a place-based augmented reality game on handheld computers (2007) Journal of Science Education and Technology, 16 (1), pp. 5-29; Van Krevelen, D., Poelman, R., A survey of augmented reality technologies, applications and limitations (2010) International Journal of Virtual Reality, 9 (2), p. 1; Prasetio, Y.L., Wijaya, R., Sjah, M.P., Christian, M.R., Chowanda, A., Location-based game to enhance players experience in survival horror game (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 116, pp. 206-213; Want, R., Hopper, A., Falcao, V., Gibbons, J., The active badge location system (1992) Acm Tois, 10 (1), pp. 91-102; Zhao, B., Chen, Q., Location spoofing in a location-based game: A case study of pokémon go (2017) International Cartographic Conference, pp. 21-32. , Springer; Chowanda, A., Flintham, M., Blanchfield, P., Valstar, M., Playing with social and emotional game companions (2016) International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents, pp. 85-95. , Springer; Chowanda, A., Blanchfield, P., Flintham, M., Valstar, M., Erisa: Building emotionally realistic social game-agents companions (2014) International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents, pp. 134-143. , Springer; Laird, J.E., Duchi, J.C., Creating human-like synthetic characters with multiple skill levels (2000) Ann Arbor, 1001, pp. 42110-48109; Lazzaro, N., (2004) Why We Play Games: Four Keys to More Emotion Without Story; Squire, K., (2011) Video Games and Learning: Teaching and Participatory Culture in the Digital Age, , Technology.

With the GPS technology, the player can play in a real world as well as in the virtual game world. We postulate this thus will enhance the player's experience. To test the hypothesis, a horror game genre with location-based features was developed. The game was evaluated to thirty participants. The results demonstrate the game allowed the participants to explore a new place with fun. In addition, the participants claimed that the game allow them to enjoy a new experience in playing horror game. The participants described that playing the game was giving them more tension compare to playing a conventional horror game. Moreover, the participants claimed that they feel more familiar with the place they've explored during the game. Finally, some improvements could be done to improve the experience enhancement to the game. First, more variation in the storyline, quests and the enemy. As the game evaluated in this paper is served only as a prototype, the variation of the storyline, quests and the enemy (i.e. The ghost) is limited. © 2017 The Authors.

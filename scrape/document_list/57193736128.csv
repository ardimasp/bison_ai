Push notification delivery needs to be effectived and has to be paid attention to time zone differences between countries in order to generate time-appropriate notifications. This push notification system was developed using distributed event-based system approach. The research methodology consists of four stages: initial research, data collection and processing, system development, and evaluation. The result of this research is a scalable web-based push notification system supported by the usage of scheduler and consumer that can help the company send notifications about game updates easier and quicker to millions of mobile devices. © 2016 IEEE.","Distributed event-based system;

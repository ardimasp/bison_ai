Cloud computing provides ample benefits to companies such as mobility, ease of access, and enable collaboration. Nevertheless, the impact of cloud computing on the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) is not well established. This research aims to classify the factors affecting the acceptance of cloud computing in Indonesian MSMEs. A total of 135 participants participated in this analysis. The TOE Structure is used in this analysis. Methods of data collection using Google form. The details have been analysed with SPSS and SmartPLS. The findings demonstrated that top management encouragement and relative advantages have a positive impact on the adoption of cloud computing in MSMEs in Indonesia. In order to increase the adoption of cloud-based computing in Indonesia, cloud-based businesses need to concentrate on these two reasons so that MSMEs in Indonesia can embrace more cloud computing. Furthermore, the improvement of cloud computing adoption should come from government policy and incentives. Theoretically, this research helps to establish the TOE framework by providing empirical evidence. This research also explains that the TOE framework can help companies to understand critical domains that impact their businesses and which domain companies should focus. © 2020, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

Factors examined are cloud storage service support, cloud storage self-efficacy, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use on intention to use CSS. Using convenience sampling method, a total of 219 postgraduate students from 4 Malaysian technical universities participated in the study. Structured equation modelling was used to analyse the data and findings indicate that CSS support have a significant positive relationship with 'perceived usefulness', and 'cloud storage self-efficacy' have significant positive relationship on the 'perceived ease of use'. Both 'perceived usefulness' and 'perceived ease of use' have a significant relationship on students' intention to use CSS. The findings of this study can help the service providers to develop successful strategic plans for usage of CSS.

E-wallet is a program or service which allows its user to save digital money and doing transactions easily whenever and wherever. Many banks and nonbank companies are competing to create innovation in this field. Go Mobile is an e-wallet product of CIMB Niaga, meanwhile, T-Cash is an e-wallet issued by a telecommunication company, PT Telkomsel. This research aimed to analyze the system, purchase and payment methods in Go Mobile and T-Cash. This research was done in qualitative design, used secondary data sourced from official websites of both companies as well as related researches. The result showed that Go Mobile and T-Cash's systems could ease the user's transaction. Go Mobile and T-Cash could be used in purchase and payment transaction through SMS as well as Android-based Smartphone application. In T-Cash, users who do not own an Android Smartphone could enjoy this service by attaching Near Field Communication (NFC) sticker on their phone. This is called T-Cash Tap. Based on the usage and ease of use, T-Cash as a telecommunication e-wallet had received highest acceptance in a society based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). © 2017 IEEE.","bank; E-wallet; payment; purchase; telecommunication","Android (operating system); Information management; Near field communication; Purchasing; Sales; Smartphones; Telecommunication; Android smartphone; bank; payment; Payment transactions; Smart-phone applications; Technology acceptance model; Telecommunication companies; The near field communication (NFC); Electronic money",,,,,,"Dospinescu, O., (2012) E-Wallet.

The results of this study by using a fit gap analysis showed that only 10% of the system running with fit criteria, so it is necessary to change the system.

The conclusion that can be drawn from this study is the firm should invest in hospitality management information system by looking at the aspects of operational and financial aspects. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

Research methods used are data collection method using questionnaire, data processing method using statistical tools such as pearson product moment correlation coefficient and cronbach's alpha, and data analysis method using gap analysis and Cartesians diagram. The expected result is user's expectation is greater than user's real experience; therefore, system quality and information quality have to be improved. Result shows that user is dissatisfied with applied monitoring information system right now. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Information; Monitoring; Quality; System","Cartesians; Data analysis methods; Data collection method; Data processing methods; Gap analysis; Information; Information quality; Monitoring information system; Product-moment correlation; research methods; Statistical tools; System; System quality; Two-dimension; User expectations; User's satisfaction; Cybernetics; Data handling; Image quality; Information analysis; Information systems; Statistical mechanics; Monitoring",,,,,,"Gover, V., Straub, D., Dan Galluch, P., Turning the corner: The influence of positive thinking on the information systems field (2009) Manag Inf Syst Q, 33 (1), pp. 3-8; Al-Zeer, N.M., Dan Areiqat, A.Y., The role of information systems in scientific research (2010) Interdiscip J Contemp Res Bus, 2 (3), pp. 329-330; Hemmatfar, M., Salehi, M., Dan Bayat, M., Competitive advantages and strategic information systems (2010) Int J Bus Manag, 50 (7), pp. 158-159; Lee, C.Y., Total manufacturing information system: A conceptual model of a strategic tool for competitive advantage (2003) Integr Manuf Syst, 14 (2), pp. 114-122; Menon, N.M., Ulku, Y., Dan Cezar, A., Differential effects of the two types of information system: A hospital-based study (2009) Manag Inf Syst J, 26 (1), pp. 297-316; Rao, B., Dan Angelov, B., Pervasive systems value chain - A services perspective (2009) Int J Innov Technol Manag, 6 (1), pp. 17-40; Johnston, H.R., Dan Vitale, M.A., Creating competitive advantage with interorganizational information systems (2008) Manag Inf Syst Q, 12 (2), pp. 153-165; Fadel, J.K., Dan Brown, S.A., Information systems appraisal and coping: The role of user perceptions (2010) Commun Assoc Inf Syst, 26 (6), pp. 527-529; Hidayat, A., (2007) Six Sigma Strategies, , Elex Media Komputindo, Ltd., Jakarta; O'Brien, J.A., (2005) Introduction to Information System, , 12th ed.

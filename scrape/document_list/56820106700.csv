Objective: This study aims to identify factors affecting visitor’s satisfaction towards shopping facilities at international airport in Jakarta. Data was collected using survey technique, where questionnaire was distributed to 200 visitors at Terminal 2, Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. Results: The result of multiple linear regression analysis shows that physical environment of shopping facilities and personal factors of visitors have significant relationships and effect toward visitor’s satisfaction at the airport shopping facilities. The result also shows that café is the most visited outlet at the respective airport. Conclusion: The study indicates that physical environment contributes more than personal factors on satisfying visitors at airport shopping facilities. Nevertheless, both aspects should be of airport management’s concern. Airport management can consider doing refurbishment to the shops as well as forming effective marketing strategies to convey positive message to the visitors about airport shopping. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

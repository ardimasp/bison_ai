State-of-the-art technique used in modeling this traffic flows is by using a linear model. In contrast, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has been the state-of-the-art technique in speech recognition, which data is also time-series. Therefore, we conjecture that the use of RNN can improve performance in dynamic bandwidth management based on traffic prediction. In this paper, we employ a variant of RNN called Deep Long Short Term Memory (DLSTM), which is common to be used in speech recognition. The result of this work shows that DLSTM is suitable for traffic prediction and is able to decrease packet loss ratio of a network system simulated using Network Simulator 3 (NS3). © 2016 IEEE.","deep long short term memory; dynamic bandwidth management; traffic prediction","Bandwidth; Brain; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Recurrent neural networks; Speech recognition; Time series; Dynamic bandwidth; Improve performance; Network simulators; Packet loss ratio; Recurrent neural network (RNN); State-of-the-art techniques; Time-series data; Traffic prediction; Long short-term memory",,,,,,"Fu, Z., Bai, J., Wang, Q., A novel dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm with correction-based the multiple traffic prediction in epon (2012) Journal of Networks, 7 (10), pp. 1554-1560; Jin, Z., Shu, Y., Liu, J., Yang, O.W.W., Prediction-based network bandwidth control (2000) Electrical and Computer Engineering 2000 Canadian Conference on, 2, pp. 675-679. , vol.2; Wei, Y., Wang, J., Wang, C., A traffic prediction based bandwidth management algorithm of a future internet architecture (2010) Intelligent Networks and Intelligent Systems (ICINIS 2010 3rd International Conference on, pp. 560-563. , Nov; Hosking, J.R., Fractional differencing (1981) Biometrika, 68 (1), pp. 165-176; Graves, A., Jaitly, N., Towards end-To-end speech recognition with recurrent neural networks (2014) Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-14, pp. 1764-1772. , http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v32/graves14.pdf, T.

It supports the natural expression of parameterized roles, the composition of policies, and the delegation of trust. Fong proposed a policy language that is based on Modal Logic for expressing and composing ReBAC policies. A natural question is whether such a language is representationally complete, that is, whether the language is capable of expressing all ReBAC policies that one is interested in expressing. In this work, we argue that the extensive use of what we call Relational Policies is what distinguishes ReBAC from traditional access control models. We show that Fong's policy language is representationally incomplete in that certain previously studied Relational Policies are not expressible in the language. We introduce two extensions to the policy language of Fong, and prove that the extended policy language is representationally complete with respect to a well-defined subclass of Relational Policies. © 2011 ACM.","Access control policies; Modal logic; Policy languages; Relationship-based access control; Social networks","Access control policies; Modal logic; Policy languages; Relationship-based access control; Social networks; Formal logic; Security systems; Access control",,,,,,"Anwar, M., Zhao, Z., Fong, P.W.L., An access control model for Facebook-style social network systems (2010) Tech.

Compliance with contracts should verified at development time, checked at depolyment time and contracts should be accepted by the platform before deployment and possibly their enforcement guaranteed, for instance by in-line monitoring.In this paper we describe the challenges that must be met in order to develop a security-by-contract framework for the Future Internet and how security research can be changed by it.© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.",,"Depolyment; Development time; Future internet; In-line; Internet application; Java servlet; Security model; Security research; Smart devices; Web servers; Fuzzy systems; Smart cards; Internet",,,,,,"(2008) Channel 4. 4od, , http://www.channel4.com/4od/index.html; Aktug, I., Naliuka, K., Conspec - a formal language for policy specification (2007) Proc. of the 1st Workshop on Run Time Enforcement for Mobile and Distributed Systems, REM; Atkinson, B., Della-Libera, G., Hada, S., Hondo, M., Hallam-Baker, P., Klein, J., LaMacchia, B., Simon, D., Web Services Security (2002) Microsoft, IBM, VeriSign, , http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-secure, 1st edn April, October 25, 2005; Bauer, L., Ligatti, J., Walker, D., Edit automata: Enforcement mechanisms for run-time security policies (2005) Int.

The key idea of the framework is that a digital signature should not just certify the origin of the code but rather bind together the code with a contract. We provide a description of the workflow for the deployment and execution of mobile code in the setting of security-by-contract, describe a structure for a contractual language and propose a number of algorithms for one of the key steps in the process, the contract-policy matching issue.We also describe the prototype for matching policies with security claims of mobile applications that we have currently implemented. We argue that security-by-contract would provide a semantics for digital signatures on mobile code thus being a step in the transition from trusted code to trustworthy code. © 2009.","Mobile code; Run-time monitor; Security; Security-by-contract","Digital signatures; Mobile applications; Mobile code; Run-time monitor; Security; Security-by-contract; Authentication; Information theory; Electronic document identification systems",,,,,"This work has been partly supported by the Projects EU-IST-STREP-S3MS and EU-IST-IP-MASTER. * Corresponding author.

In this paper we describe a security architecture for Web 2.0 applications that supports the flexible integration of a variety of advanced technologies for such secure execution of applications, including run-time monitoring, static verification and proof-carrying code. The architecture also supports the execution of legacy applications that have not been developed to take advantage of our architecture, though it can provide better performance and additional services for applications that are architecture-aware. A prototype of the proposed architecture has been built that offers substantial security benefits compared to standard (state-of-practice) security architectures, even for legacy applications. © 2009 The authors and IOS Press.

In order to capture realistic scenarios with potentially infinite transitions (e.g. ""only connections to urls starting with https"") we have proposed to represent those policies with the notion of Automata Modulo Theory (AMT), an extension of Büchi Automata (BA), with edges labeled by expressions in a decidable theory. Our objective is the run-time matching of the mobile's platform policy against the midlet's security claims expressed as AMT. To this extent the use of on-the-fly product and emptiness test from automata theory may not be effective. In this paper we present an algorithm extending fair simulation between Büchi automata that can be more efficiently implemented.

For example, extended finite-state automata (EFSA) augment finite-state automata (FSA) with variables to track dependencies between arguments of system calls. In this paper, we introduce extended finite automata (XFAs) which augment FSAs with finite scratch memory and instructions to manipulate this memory. Our primary motivation for introducing XFAs is signature matching in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Representing NIDS signatures as deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) results in very fast signature matching but for several types of signatures DFAs can blowup in space. Nondeterministic finite-state automata (NFA) representation of NIDS signatures results in a succinct representation but at the expense of higher time complexity for signature matching. In other words, DFAs are time-efficient but space-inefficient, and NFAs are space-efficient but time-inefficient. Our goal is to find a representation of signatures that is both time and space efficient. In our experiments we have noticed that for a large class of NIDS signatures XFAs have time complexity similar to DFAs and space complexity similar to NFAs. For our test set, XFAs use 10 times less memory than a DFA-based solution, yet achieve 20 times higher matching speeds. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Computer crime; Finite automata; Information systems; Internet; Intrusion detection; Nanostructured materials; Robots; Security of data; Translation (languages); Information security; Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS); NIDS signatures; Signature matching; Space complexities; System calls; Time complexities; Automata theory",,,,,,"Aho, A.V., Corasick, M.J., Efficient string matching: An aid to bibliographic search (1975) Communications, , of the ACM June; Alur, R., Timed automata (1999) Proceedings of the Int.

The key idea of S×C (similar to the one of Model-Carrying Code) is to augment mobile code with a claim on its security behavior (a contract) that could be matched against a mobile platform policy before downloading the code. The rational is that, thanks to S×C, a digital signature does not just certify the origin of the code but also bind together the code with a contract. In this paper we address one of the key issue of the S×C paradigm, namely the contract-policy matching problem, proposing a prototype for matching policies with security claims of mobile applications. This result can be considered a key step towards the achievement of the S×C main goal: provide a semantics for digital signatures on mobile code, thus being a step in the transition from trusted code to trustworthy code. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Digital signatures; International conferences; Matching problems; Mobile applications; Mobile codes; Mobile platforms; Security modeling; Trust relationships; Access control; Authentication; Codes (standards); Contracts; Digital arithmetic; Electronic document identification systems; Information theory; Mobile devices; Software prototyping; Telecommunication equipment; Codes (symbols)",,,,,,"Aktug, I., Naliuka, K., Conspec - a formal language for policy specification (2007) Proc. of the 1st Workshop on Run Time Enforcement for Mobile and Distributed Systems (REM2007); Clarke, E.M., Grumberg, O., Peled, D.A., (2000) Model Checking, , The MIT Press; Dragoni, N., Massacci, F., Naliuka, K., Siahaan, I., Security-by- contract: Toward a semantics for digital signatures on mobile code (2007) Proc. of the 4th European PKI Worshop, pp. 297-312. , Springer-Verlag; Dragoni, N., Massacci, F., Naliuka, K., Siahaan, I., Quillinan, T., Matteucci, I., Schaefer, C., Methodologies and tools for contract matching.

Many people now already have a device that can connect to the Internet and run untrusted code, typically a cell-phone or PDA. Having such a large interconnected and powerful computing base presents some new security issues. In order to counter new threats, the traditional security architectures need to be overhauled to support a new and more flexible way of securely executing mobile code. This article describes the concept of security-by-contract (SxC) and its implementation on the .NET platform. This new model allows users to guarantee that an untrusted application remains within the boundaries of acceptable behavior, as defined by the user herself. A number of different techniques will be presented that can be employed to enforce this behavior. In order to support the SxC paradigm, some new steps can be introduced in the application development process. In addition to building an application, developers can create an application contract and securely bind this contract to the application. The application deployment process supports legacy applications developed without such contracts, but it can support more advanced enforcement technologies for those applications that are SxC-aware. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The key idea of the framework is that a digital signature should not just certify the origin of the code but rather bind together the code with a contract. We provide a description of the overall life-cycle of mobile code in the setting of security-by-contract, describe a tentative structure for a contractual language and propose a number of algorithms for one of the key steps in the process, the contract-policy matching issue. We argue that security-by-contract would provide a semantics for digital signatures on mobile code thus being a step in the transition from trusted code to trustworthy code. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",,"Codes (symbols); Electronic document identification systems; Formal languages; Mobile telecommunication systems; Semantics; Contract policy; Mobile codes; Security of data",,,,,,"Building bug-free O-O software: An introduction to Design by Contract(TM).

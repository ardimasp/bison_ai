The requirements gathering is already done to identify and analyze the requirements of this project. The design process uses agile development methodology, whereas the testing process uses unit test and system integration test. The testing processes provide insight and understanding of system integration implementation process. The result of unit test and system integration test shows that the main business processes are fulfilled and accommodated successfully as the result of system integration. This system integration brought several benefits and value in the form of increased effectiveness in data exchange between systems in the business process cycle, accuracy on the exchanged data due to the occurring data validation done on the middleware level, and the efficiency of data exchange due to use of the developed web services that is integrated and supports real-time data update. © 2019 IEEE.","Agile Methodology; Enterprise Resource Planning; System Integration; System Integration Test; Terminal Operating System; Unit Test","Agile manufacturing systems; Electronic data interchange; Enterprise resource planning; Middleware; Ports and harbors; Real time systems; Resource allocation; Systems engineering; Testing; Web services; Agile development methodologies; Agile Methodologies; Enterprise resource planning systems; Implementation process; Integration process; Requirements gathering; System integration; Unit tests; Integration testing",,,,,"Kain, R., Verma, A., Logistics management in supply chain-An overview (2018) Mater.

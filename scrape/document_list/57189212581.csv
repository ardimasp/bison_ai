The low level of SMEs knowledge on IT Governance results in a low level of effectiveness of IT use in SMEs so that organizations cannot evaluate the benefits of using IT in organizations - research methods carried out through observation to the SMEs about the use of IT to support business processes and evaluate the effectiveness of IT use. The results of this research are training models for SMEs to implement IT Governance or Information Technology Governance Training SME (ITGTSme). Practical implications are the resulting training models that can be used for SMEs to gain knowledge about the implementation of IT governance through training. The paper contributes to the improvement of SMEs' knowledge especially knowledge of IT Governance implementation and encourages SMEs who have not used IT fully to be able to use IT better. © 2020 IEEE.","IT governance; ITGTMS; Small medium enterprise","Business Process; Information technology governance; IT governance; Offline; Small medium enterprise; Training model; Information management",,,,,,"(2020) International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering (IJRTE), 8 (5). , Inayatulloh, Assistance Decision Model for SMEs January; Successful of smes through electronic commerce learning (2020) International Journal of Innovation, Creativity and Change, , Inayatulloh (2020)/E-ISSN: 2201-1323.

With the increasing number of non-cash transactions from bank customers, a website design is needed to visualize customer non-cash transaction data. This study aims to design customer websites. Website design method used is the Waterfall method with several steps, like Communication (Project Initiation Requirement Gathering), Planning (Estimating, Scheduling, Tracking), Modeling (Analysis Design) and Construction (Code Test). The design produces a website for users. The website for visualizing customer noncash transaction data generated, it will make it easier for customers to see, analyze and control expenses made through visualizing customer non-cash transaction data. © 2020 IEEE.","Non-cash payment; Visualization of non-cash transaction data; Waterfall","Banking; Data visualization; Design; Information management; Sales; Service industry; Websites; Analysis / design; Banking sectors; Cash payments; Cash transaction; Project initiations; Requirement gathering; Transaction data; Waterfall methods; Web Design",,,,,"Listfield, R., Montes-Negret, F., (1994) Modernizing Payment System in Emerging Economies, , World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 1336; https://www.nontunai.com/kenali/apa-itu-nontunai/, Website nontunai. com [Accessed: 02-Mar-2020]; Website Bi.

People are beginning to change the lifestyles of shopping by making purchases on e-commerce sites online. This makes companies offer their products not only in the market or shopping center but also through the e-commerce site. With e-commerce sites, people as potential buyers and regular customers will have many variations of products to purchase. They can shop anywhere and anytime by using an e-commerce site. Marketplace e-commerce sites have been equipped with reviews and comments from every expert and buyer who has purchased the product on the marketplace e-commerce site. The problems that occur are with the large number of products and merchants who can sell the same product, making potential buyers need more time in choosing the right product. They also need to see the review to choose the merchant that provides satisfactory service. The research question is whether the Decision Support System Model equipped with integrated review and comment can assist the customer to choose merchant with their expected product on marketplace e-commerce sites? The result for this model is customer can convenience to choose best merchant to shop in marketplace e-commerce site.

The case of Bina Nusantara University’s library is used in this study. In this kind of library, near field communication (NFC) tags are placed in the book for getting book information, borrowing or returning and theft prevention, so the application. Stocktaking is an important process to be performed periodically to monitor and maintain the quality of collections and to make these collections easily accessible for library users. However, stocktaking in libraries takes too much effort and needs to be more efficient. Design/methodology/approach: The design of the mobile application using entity relationship diagram (ERD) includes a diagram and flowchart. An evaluation is done by comparing the stocktaking effort of the latest semester and the previous semester. In the latest semester, the stocktaking is done by a hybrid of the proposed mobile application and a legacy desktop application, whereas the stocktaking of the previous semester is done only using the legacy desktop application. Findings: Evaluation of the usage of this mobile stocktaking application is 43 per cent more efficient compared to an older desktop application. Originality/value: The authors report the development of Android-based mobile stocktaking application by using Android’s NFC feature and evaluate it in a real environment. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Library stocktaking; Mobile application; NFC",,,,,,"Bohn, J., Coroamă, V., Langheinrich, M., Mattern, F., Rohs, M., Living in a world of smart everyday objects – social, economic, and ethical implications (2004) Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal, 10 (5), pp. 763-785; Golding, P., Tennant, V., Using RFID inventory reader at the item-level in a library environment: performance benchmark (2010) The Electronic Journal Information Systems Evaluation, 13 (2), pp. 107-120. , http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/55365370/using-rfid-inventory-reader-item-level-library-environment-performance-benchmark, (accessed, 24 October 2015; (2015) Near field communication | Android Developers, , https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/index.html, (accessed, 23 October 2015; Mehrjerdi, Y.Z., RFID: the big player in the libraries of the future (2011) The Electronic Library, 29 (1), pp. 36-51. , Emerald Group Publishing Limited; (2015) NXP documentation, , www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/SL2S2602.pdf, (accessed, 24 October 2015; (2005) Smart Label IC SL2 ICS20 functional specification, , www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/058031.pdf, (accessed, 30 October 2015; (2013) 1MA182_5E_NFC_WHITE_PAPER.pdf, , http://cdn.rohde-schwarz.com/pws/dl_downloads/dl_application/application_notes/1ma182/1MA182_5E_NFC_WHITE_PAPER.pdf, (accessed, 23 October 2015; Sandhu, G., Ukwoma, S., Awaking Stock taking practice in academic libraries; The Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology (2012) Proceedings of the 12th Annual Conference/Annual General Meeting, Liberty Centre, Independence Layout, , http://roar.uel.ac.uk/1771/1/AwakingStocktakingpractices.pdf, (accessed, 19 October 2015, Nigeria Library Association, Enugu: Enugu State Chapter; Singh, J., Brar, N., Fong, C., The state of RFID applications in libraries – ProQuest (2006) Information Technology and Libraries, 25 (1), pp. 24-32. , http://e-resources.perpusnas.go.id:2057/docview/215830977/fulltextPDF/588FA5637823457FPQ/7?accountid=25704, (accessed, 24 October 2015; Stevens, K., Taking stock – the process and benefits of performing a regular library stocktake (2011) The ANZTLA EJournal, pp. 2-6. , www.nla.gov.au/ojs/index.php/ANZTLA/article/view/2951, (accessed, 19 October 2015; Suda, K.A., Rani, N.S.A., Radio frequency identification for efficient library Management.pdf (2013) International Journal of Business and Social Science, 4 (15), pp. 125-131. , http://ijbssnet.com/journals/Vol_4_No_15_Special_Issue_November_2013/18.pdf, (accessed, 18 October 2015; Tajima, M., Strategic value of RFID in supply chain management (2007) Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 13 (4), pp. 261-273; Wild, T., (2004) Improving Inventory Record Accuracy, Improving Inventory Record Accuracy, , Elsevier, New York, NY; Clarke, R., Managing a reserve collection (1994) Library Review, 43 (6), pp. 18-26. , MCB UP Ltd; Curran, K., Porter, M., A primer on radio frequency identification for libraries (2007) Library Hi Tech, 25 (4), pp. 595-611. , Schmetzke, A.and (Ed.), Emerald Group Publishing Limited, Bingley","Wibisurya, A.; Bina Nusantara UniversityIndonesia; email: aswinwibisurya@gmail.com",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,07419058,,,,"English","Libr.

The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that influence users' acceptance level of HIS in a private multi-specialty hospital in Indonesia as it was expected to give a proper guideline for the management in the current and future HIS development. This study applied a model that had been modified from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and analyzed by using the Structured Equation Model-Partial Least Square (SEM-PLS). The final results indicate ease of use and perceived usefulness as the main factors that should receive the management's utmost attention as they significantly affect the acceptance level of HIS in the hospital. © 2016 IEEE.","Acceptance; Hospital Information System; SEM-PLS; Technology Acceptance Model","Information management; Information systems; Medical computing; Acceptance; Health care providers; Hospital information systems; Partial least square (PLS); Perceived usefulness; Private hospitals; Structured equation modeling; Technology acceptance model; Hospitals",,,,,"Chatterjee, D., Grewal, R., Sambamurthy, V., Shaping up for e-commerce: Institutional enablers of the organizational assimilation of web technologies (2002) MIS Quarterly, pp. 65-89; Chen, R.F., Hsiao, L.J., An investigation on physicians' acceptance of hospital information systems: A case study (2012) International Journal of Medical Informatics, 81 (12), pp. 810-820; Davis, F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3), pp. 319-340; DeLone, W.H., McLean, E.R., Information systems success: The quest for the dependent variable (1992) Information Systems Research, 3 (1), pp. 60-95; Delone, W.H., McLean, E.R., The DeLone and McLean model of information systems success: A ten-year update (2003) Journal of Management YYinformation Systems, 19 (4), pp. 9-30; Ribière, V., LaSalle, A.J., Khorramshahgol, R., Gousty, Y., Hospital information systems quality: A customer satisfaction assessment tool (1999) Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Science, pp. 7-16. , Hawaii.

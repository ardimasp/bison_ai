Customer Knowledge Management (CKM) is more than just a method of applying Knowledge Management (KM) concepts that already exist in an organization. Where, if the KM concept focuses on creating knowledge and innovations sourced from within the organization, the CKM focuses on the consumer's perspective as a trigger for the creation and improvement of innovation. In other words, CKM builds two-way communication between companies and consumers, with the aim of accelerating knowledge creation. Expected knowledge will be more targeted at engaging customer expectations for company services. © 2018 IEEE.","customer knowledge management; customer satisfaction; knowledge management; team-based co-learning; web application","Customer satisfaction; Human resource management; Knowledge acquisition; Sales; Co-learning; Customer expectation; Customer knowledge management; Effective communication; Knowledge creations; Telecommunication companies; Two way communications; WEB application; Knowledge management",,,,,"Kontoghiorghes, C., Awbrey, S.M., Feurig, P.L., Examining the relationship between learning organization characteristics and change adaptation, innovation, and organizational performance (2005) Hum.

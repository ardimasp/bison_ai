Online Rental Application is here to help private vehicle owners to maximize the use of their personal vehicles while helping private vehicle owners to earn extra income. The purpose of writing is to develop applications that allow users to choose the vehicle according to their needs and to process the rental of vehicles both motorbikes and cars. The development method used is the waterfall method which consists of communication, planning, modeling, construction, deployment. The results are evaluated with 8 golden rules of interface design and the results of the questionnaire show that the application can be used by users and providers to make the process of renting and renting a vehicle. It was concluded that this application can be used well and can carry out the process of renting and renting vehicles for cars and motorbikes. © 2020 by Advance Scientific Research.","Marketplace; Mobile Application; Private Vehicle; Rental Online",,,,,,,"(2017) Smartphone Market Share, , https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/os, IDC, Available; Collins, C, (2012) Simple Fixes for your Car: How to do Small Jobs yourself and Save Money, , England: Veloce Publishing Limited; Kesrarat, D., Songcharoenkit, S., Nanthapornpisut, P., Thawonthammarat, L., (2017) Smart Matching for Car Rental, , Singapore; Whitten, J.

For students, the game can have a positive impact, namely increasing cognitive and motoric abilities. This research seeks to see the experience of students in Jakarta after playing the DOTA 2 game. DOTA 2 is one of the famous games and one of the games that once recorded a record of making an event with the biggest prize in the world of E-Sport. The research method used is neuroresearch. Data is obtained through questionnaires with user experience indicators. The results of the study show that the graphics and game style are the determinants of user experience where gameplay and the purpose of play are the main indicators of the user experience of this game. © 2019 IEEE.","Game; Student; User Experience","Artificial intelligence; Surveys; Digital era; E-sports; Game; Gameplay; Jakarta; Multiplayers; research methods; User experience; Students",,,,"Binus University","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is partially supported by Research Interest Group In Educational Technology, Bina Nusantara University.

On the other hand, games can provoke interest in learning and can improve cognitive and motor skills. The research discusses the development of educational games to help learning mathematics in the theme of statistics in 5th grade elementary school student. This educational game is designed with research methods. The application is designed using UNITY to run the program, Paint tool SAI to draw characters, Dragon bones for animation, Adobe Photoshop to create sprite sheet.

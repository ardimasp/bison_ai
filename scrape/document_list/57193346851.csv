Johannes Itten’s theory of color serves as a thinking base in this study. The theory is reflected in the cultures of Indonesia, and represented by island of Sumatera (Aceh DA, Medan, Padang, Bengkulu, Palembang, and Lampung). The scope of the subject matters is limited to traditional textile products such as traditional costumes and bridal apparel, and culinary. The textile products are chosen because they become reflection of a culture whose place is close to society, and its color become the society’s own identity. The research method is qualitative, consist of literature study, experts interviews (historians and artists), and visiting cultural centers especially the ones associated with textile and culinary product. The result of the study is presented in the form of morphological matrix on cultural color. The matrix is supported with arguments and classroom experiments which allows students to use, cultivate, and maximize the method of applying color in visual communication to achieve harmony and contrast. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Cultural analysis; Island of Sumatera; Local color; Morphological matrix",,,,,"Binus University","This work was supported in part by Bina Nusantara University under Grant.","Dar Maprawira, S., (2002) Warna: Teori Dan Kreatifitas Penggunaannya Bandung ITB, pp. 42-43; Dinata, S., (2010), http://elib.unikom.ac.id/files/disk1/457/jbptunikompp-gdl-septyandin-22827-2-unikom_s-i.pdf, Retrieved November 7, 2014; Fraser, T., Banks, A., (2004) The Complete Guide to Color, , Ilex Press Ltd., UK; Feisner, E.A., (2000) Colour: How to Use Colour in Art and Design, pp. 121-122. , Laurence King Publishing, London; Van Leeuwen, T., (2011) The Language of Colour, pp. 43-44. , Routledge, Oxon; Finding Your Dominant Colour Personality, , https://unifiedspace.wordpress.com/2011/05/19/finding-your-dominantcolour-personality, (2011, May 19); Stone, T.E., Adams, S., Morioka, N., (2006) Color Design Workbook: A Real-World Guide to Using Color in Graphic Design, 46, 18p. , Rockport Publishers, Inc., London; Van Hagen Itten, E., (1970) The Element of Color Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, New York, Cincinnati, Toronto, 92p. , London, Melbourne; Ma’Arif, J., (2013) Bertahan Di Tengah Gempuran Teknologi, , http://bengkuluekspress.com/bertahan-ditahan-gempuranteknologi, Retrieved November 7, 2014; Woolman, M., (2009) 100 Visual Ideas Color Combinations, 7p. , APB Ltd., Surrey; Kuno, N., (1999) FORMS Inc., Color in Context, Graphic-Sha Pub.

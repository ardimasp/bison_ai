Nutricell Pacific is a private feed additive manufacturing industry located in Tangerang, where they implement barcode system in their production department for 10 months. They applied QR code as their products information storage. The main goal of this research is to evaluate the barcode system from the system perspective in the aspect of efficiency and effectiveness, identify the valid factors which affect the overall performance and find alternative solutions. Without official overall audits, the company could not detect the possible issue or technical improvements required. Hence, by using DeLone and McLean success model variables and system evaluation theory as the qualitative approach could find the potential elements and determine the current efficiency and effectiveness. Based on hypothesis testing, interviews and 15 respondent questionnaires, the findings of this research will reveal the factors which affect the worker’s performance in interacting with barcode system. The possible factors consist of system quality, information quality, user satisfaction and organization impact. Accordingly, through the methodology applied, the results certainly show the efficiency and effectiveness according to the workers and systems interaction lenses and not from the technical perspectives.

Data were obtained by distributing questionnaires in April-June 2018 to 106 consumers who had bought organic food in the past. Data was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). This study examines the factors that influence the actual buying behavior of organic food products such as health awareness, knowledge of organic food, subjective norms, perceived price and availability. In addition, attitude towards organic food and purchase intention was also tested as a medium for these five factors to influence actual buying behavior. Socio-demographic factors were also tested to determine their influence. The results showed that health consciousness and availability affected people's behavior towards organic food. This behavior is then proven to affect purchase intention which also affects actual buying behavior. With this research, it is expected to be able to explore the interest of Indonesian people to improve health and help marketers of organic food. © BEIESP.","Actual Buying Behavior; Consumer Attitude; Indonesia; Organic Foods; Purchase Intention",,,,,,"G Aertsens, J., Mondelaers, K., Verbeke, W., Buysse, J., Huylenbroeck, G.V., The influence of subjective and objective knowledge on attitude, motivations and consumption of organic food (2011) British Food Journal, pp. 1353-1378; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned Behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, pp. 179-211; Apaolaza, V., Hartmann, P., D'souza, C., López, C.M., Eat organic–Feel good?

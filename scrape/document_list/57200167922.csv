Companies can use information obtained from social media to analyze how the communities respond to their services or products. The biggest challenge in processing information in social media like Twitter, is the unstructured sentences which could lead to incorrect text processing. However, this information is very important for companies’ survival. In this research, we proposed a method to extract keywords from tweets in Indonesian language, WPKE. We compared it with RAKE, an algorithm that is language independent and usually used for keyword extraction. Finally, we develop a method to do clustering to groups the topics of complaints with data set obtained from Twitter using the “komplain” hashtag. Our method can obtain the accuracy of 72.92% while RAKE can only obtain 35.42%. Copyright © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

However, the limitation of the length that can be written is about 160 characters and the text is in unstructured sentence. It becomes the biggest obstacle to process the information. Those unstructured sentences cause a difficulty for preprocessing in text processing tools. Therefore, normalization is needed to make the unstructured sentences can be more understandable by a machine. We proposed a normalization of Indonesian language method which adopting some ideas of normalization from other researchers and adjust to the problem of Indonesian characteristic in unstructured sentence. The experiment exploits Twitter data which use Indonesian language in complaint category. The process is divided into three stages, which are cleaning process, OOV detection and word replacement. List of Basic words and Slang dictionary are used in the OOV detection. On the other hand, Context dictionary is built to solve the ambiguity problem. The algorithm can reaches the accuracy about 90% in a complaint category. © 2017 The Authors.

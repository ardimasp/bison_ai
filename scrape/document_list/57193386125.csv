It analyses KMS using factor analysis to determine the factors influencing user awareness of KM Portal. Research is done through questionnaire on 275 respondents to collect data on KM Portal. The study showed that three factors influenced user awareness for KM Portal, 1) quality of KM Portal content and features; 2) admin and company participation; 3) user participation. All factors produced a model that can be used for the calculation of user awareness of KM Portal. It also showed that in terms of data processing, the current state of KM Portal is barely sufficient. Thereby suggesting that the company can increase user awareness of KM Portal by improving the three factors mentioned. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Evaluation; Factor analysis; Knowledge; Knowledge management system; User awareness",,,,,,"Chung-Hung, T., Hwang-Yeh, C., Assessing knowledge management system success: An empirical study in Taiwan's high-tech industry (2007) Journal of America Academy of Business, 10 (2), pp. 257-263; Eftekharzadeh, R., Knowledge management implementation in developing countries: An experimental study (2008) Review of Business, 28 (3), pp. 44-58; Fong, P.S.W., Choi, S.K.Y., The processes of knowledge management in professional service firms in the construction industry: A critical assessment of both theory and practice (2009) Journal of Knowledge Management, 13 (2), pp. 110-126; Juan-Gabriel, C., Cepeda-Carrión, G., How to implement a knowledge management program in hospital-in-the-home units (2010) Leadership in Health Services, 23 (1), pp. 46-56; Keiser, B.E., Building communities through knowledge management (2013) Online Searcher, 37 (5), pp. 16-21; Keiser, B.E., Knowledge management at GE and CCH (2013) Online Searcher, 37 (4), pp. 20-22; Maier, R., (2007) Knowledge Management System: Information and Communication Technologies for Knowledge Management, , (3rd Ed.)

In this research, the authors designed an OERI application to support the learning material. The application uses the technique of service-oriented architecture in the search for educational services in three repositories which are DBPedia, Ariadne and OpenLearn. The application itself will be installed as plugins in Moodle. The focus in this research is the support of the educational material in the three educational repositories used which concerns how the three educational repositories can produce a relevant educational material document with the desired query. The measurement uses precision to measure the accuracy of the query, and along with it we will also measure the number of documents retrieved, and the number of documents types retrieved. Then these results will be used to compare the three educational repositories.

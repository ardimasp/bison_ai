Further, this research investigates whether interaction of corporate and endorser credibility in ads can help consumers improve their perception toward the risk and confidence to purchase the product. An experimental study with a 2 (endorser credibility: high vs. low) × 2 (corporate credibility: high vs. low) full-factorial, between-subjects design was used to see the interaction effect of both corporate and endorser credibility on consumer perceived risk and consumer confidence to purchase a product. In a technologically complex product such as smartphones, consumers’ perceived risk was found to be lower when the product was produced by a credible company but endorsed by a less credible source, than when it was produced by a less credible company but endorsed by a more credible source. Consumer confidence in purchasing the product was also higher when the product was produced by a credible company but endorsed by a less credible source, than when it was produced by a less credible company but endorsed by a more credible source. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","consumer confidence; Corporate credibility; Elaboration Likelihood Model; endorser credibility; perceived risk; purchase decision; technologically complex product",,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., Joachimsthaler, E., (2000) Brand Leadership, , New York: Free Press; Akaah, I.P., Korgaonkar, P.K., A Conjoint Investigation of the Relative Importance of Risk Relievers in Direct Marketing (1988) Journal of Advertising Research, 28 (August/September), pp. 38-44; Atkin, C., Block, M., Effectiveness of Celebrity Endorsers (1983) Journal of Advertising Research, 23 (February/March), pp. 57-61; Bauer, R.A., Consumer Behavior as Risk Taking (1960) Dynamic Marketing for a Changing World, pp. 389-398. , Hancock R.S., (ed), Chicago, IL: American Marketing Association,. edited by; Bennett, P.D., Harrell, G.D., The Role of Confidence in Understanding and Predicting Buyers’ Attitudes and Purchase Intentions (1975) Journal of Consumer Research, 2, pp. 110-117; Berger, I.E., The Nature of Attitude Accessibility and Attitude Confidence: A Triangulated Experiment (1992) Journal of Consumer Psychology, 1, pp. 103-123; Berger, I.E., Mitchell, A.A., The Effect of Advertising on Attitude Accessibility, Attitude Confidence, and the Attitude-Behavior Relationship (1989) Journal of Consumer Research, 16 (December), pp. 269-279; Biswas, D., Biswas, A., Das, N., The Differential Effects of Celebrity and Expert Endorsements on Consumer Risk Perceptions: The Role of Consumer Knowledge, Perceived Congruency, and Product Technology Orientation (2006) Journal of Advertising Research, 35 (2), pp. 17-31; Bower, B.A., Landreth, S., Is Beauty Best?

This study has an objective to investigate the factors influencing millennial's housing purchase decision in Indonesia. The conceptual framework developed based on previous literature and then adding family member’s influence as a new factor considering that Indonesian people has collectivist culture. Based on questionnaires collected from 179 respondents of housing buyers in Greater Jakarta Area and other cities in Indonesia show that Structural Attributes, Location, and Financial factors positively influence millennial’s purchase decision towards housing in Indonesia. Meanwhile the other two factors, Property Developer and Family Member's Influence, are not influential.

With the increasing access to Internet usage in society, public access to P2P lending applications will also be more open. It is proven by the significant increase of transactions in P2P lending applications in current years. Previous research has focused more on the phenomenon of P2P lending growth and its relation to the existing financial ecosystem, namely banking, and research that focuses more on MSMEs as P2P lending application users. Therefore, we see the need for research to find out what factors influence the intention to use P2P lending applications, including knowing the positive impact of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, trust, user innovation, and government support for attitude towards using the P2P lending applications, and the positive impact of attitude towards use for behavioral intention to use P2P lending applications. The study was conducted by taking a sample of 150 people who had never applied a P2P lending application and were domiciled in Greater Jakarta. The data analysis method used for hypothesis testing was Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results show that trust and user innovativeness factors have a positive effect on attitude towards using P2P lending applications and attitude towards use has a positive effect on behavioral intention to use P2P lending applications. Meanwhile, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and government support do not have a positive impact on attitude towards utilizing P2P lending applications. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Universities are faced with challenges and opportunities in acquiring the increasing MBA market. The present study uses conjoint analysis to explore Indonesia’s MBA market preferences in choosing a university by examining the tradeoffs made on attributes considered important in decision making, which has not previously been discussed. Therefore, the present study fills a gap in the research and aids practitioners in understanding the preferences of the MBA market in Indonesia, thus enabling them to design a program and marketing strategy accordingly. The results show that total tuition fees and lecturing time are the most critical attributes. Thus, attributes defining quality were found not to be of significant concern, while programs that offer alternatives in reducing financial burden and time were more valued. © 2020 Association for Continuing Higher Education.","Conjoint analysis; higher education; Indonesia; MBA school preference; university choice",,,,,,"Abubakar, B., Shanka, T., Muuka, G.N., Tertiary education: An investigation of location selection criteria and preferences by international students - the case of two Australian universities (2010) Journal of Marketing for Higher Education, 20 (1), pp. 49-68. , https://doi.org/10.1080/08841241003788052, &; Al-Mutairi, A., Saeid, M., Factors affecting students’ choice for MBA program in Kuwait universities (2016) International Journal of Business and Management, 11 (3), p. 119. , https://doi.org/10.5539/ijbm.v11n3p119; (2020), https://www.bi.go.id/id/moneter/informasi-kurs/transaksi-bi/Default.aspx, Kurstransaksi BI - Bank SentralRepublik Indonesia; Blackburn, G., Which master of business administration (MBA)?

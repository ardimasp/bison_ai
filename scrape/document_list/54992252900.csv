Visual Novels are very popular in Japan, where they make up nearly 70% of PC games released. However, due to its heavy contents of erotic things and sex scenes, this type of games are less acceptable in other regions. Despite its popularity, not many tools or engines are available to help visual novel creators to easily develop these games. The implemented prototype is developed using Java Swing. Basically, the program has two main components, the visual authoring interface and the compiler. The visual interface lets the users to specify the flow of the story and compose words, pictures, as well as sounds to tell stories. Having finished the composition, the users can compile it to a Java class simply by pressing a button, that can then run independently outside the authoring tool itself. Unlike other Visual Novels authoring tools that require users to write a script to specify the novels, the proposed tool provides a graphical interface to compose the novels. This visual approach frees the users from learning the scripting which normally is a an obstacle for non-technical users. It also facilitates the settings of users' involvement level in the composed novel that allows the creator of this novels to adjust how much engagement of the users is expected in the finished novels. A simple test on the users shows that this visual authoring interface can help non-technical users to develop a visual novel relatively easily. Moreover, since it uses Java Swing , the tool is ensured to work crossplatform.","Authoring tool; Game development; Java swing; Visual novel","Animation; IPTV; Java programming language; Program compilers; Security of data; Security systems; Software design; Authoring tool; Game development; Graphical interface; Java swing; Non-technical users; Visual authoring tools; Visual Interface; Visual novel; Computer games",,,,,"(2008) AMN and Anime Advanced Announced Anime Game Demo Downloads, , http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/pressrelease.php?id=1510, February 18, Online.

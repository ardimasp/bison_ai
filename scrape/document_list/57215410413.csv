With Indonesia undergoing 2019 presidential election, a detection of buzzers that causes much trouble in maintaining information neutrality is seen as a needed. One of the many reasons is because those buzzers spread false news making the information gained by the use of social media to be not neutral and deliberately offends or attack those that they are not in favor of. Those buzzers share a similar characteristic, tendency, or even possess the same pattern. Grouping, classification, and detection method are used to counter this problem. This research gives a slight overview of what is happening in social media and a theory of how to deal with those problems. The argument is expected to help to identify buzzer in real life, thus helps in maintaining information neutrality along with the social media in Indonesia. © 2019 IEEE.","2019 Indonesia Presidential Election; buzzer detection; social media retrieval","Detection methods; Indonesia; Presidential election; Social media; Social networking (online)",,,,,"(2017) Survey Penetrasi & Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia, , https://apjii.or.id/survei2017/download/WF1lRD24ZzBHpxemXGKgrV6JCvjQcw, Indonesia Internet Service Provider Association.

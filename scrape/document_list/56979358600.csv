The methods used include the method of analysis in the form of literature and field studies to observe the activities of the running system, interviews with stakeholders, user surveys and design method using the Unified Modelling Language, and design the system architecture and features. The result of this research is the development of the library system by implementing an integrated flow of circulation of books between libraries. The conclusions of this research is toimplement an integrated book circulationbetween libraries, then the inter-library loan can be done in an integrated manner. © 2015 The Authors.

Pancasila as a Indonesia Ideology, so young people must understand about Pancasila value. As Indonesian people, millennial generation lack of sense of nationalism because they don't understand about Pancasila value. They prefer interested to learn foreign culture than learning Pancasila value. Because of that to attract young people learning Pancasila value, it is must using interesting way for learning. Along with this research, the writer wants to Enhance Learning Experience through Visual Novel Game Genre. Researches uses User Experience Questionnaire to calculate overall participants reaction about what they experienced about The Friendship Game. The Friendship game have 5 chapters in total, the name of the chapters itself are inherited from Pancasila. The result show that while The Friendship game could relay the moral of the story very well, The game also Motivate the users to apply Pancasila morals into their everyday life and simultaneously increase the users knowledge about Pancasila and its principal seeds, The Character Design, The User Interface, and Layout Design itself should be taken into consideration as they could affect the users overall experience. So it could be concluded that The Friendship Visual Novel Game has an story that could relay the message inside to the users, motivate the users to apply Pancasila in their daily life and also increase their overall knowledge about Pancasila. © 2020 IEEE.","Learning experience; Pancasila value; User experience; User interface","Human computer interaction; Information management; User interfaces; Character designs; Daily lives; Enhance learning; Indonesia; Layout designs; Video game; Young peoples; User experience",,,,,"Game, P., Visual, E., Berbasis, N., Karakter, P., Materi, P., (2013) Unnes Journal of Biology Education PENGEMBANGAN GAME EDUKASI VISUAL NOVEL BERBASIS, p. 2; Education, P., Untuk, G., Hasil, M., Ipa, B., Konsep, B., Makhluk, K., (2012) Jurnal Pendidikan IPA Indonesia, 1, pp. 75-81; Yudhanti, R., Pancasila dan berbagai permasalahan aktual (2016) Semin Nas Huk Univ Negeri Semarang, 2, pp. 599-610; Puji Asmaroini, A., Menjaga eksistensi pancasila dan penerapannya bagi masyarakat di era globalisasi (2017) J Pancasila Dan Kewarganegaraan; Irhandayaningsih, A., Peranan pancasila dalam menumbuhkan kesadaran nasionalisme generasi muda di era global (2012) Humanika, 16, pp. 1-10; Hamari, J., Shernoff, D.J., Rowe, E., Coller, B., Asbell-Clarke, J., Edwards, T., Challenging games help students learn: An empirical study on engagement, flow and immersion in game-based learning (2016) Comput Human Behav, 54, pp. 170-179; Divjak, B., Tomic, D., The impact of gamebased learning on the achievement of learning goals and motivation for learning mathematics-literature review (2011) Journal of Information and Organizational Sciences, 35, pp. 15-30; Magister, P., Keahlian, B., Grafika, I., Seni, D.A.N., Informatika, J.T., Informasi, F.T., (2017) EFEKTIVITAS PENGGUNAAN GAME EDUKASI BERJENIS PUZZLE, RPG DAN PUZZLE RPG; Fujimoto, T., Shigeta, K., (2017) The Research Trends in Game-Based Learning and Open Education the Research Trends in Game-Based Learning and Open; Proulx, J., Romero, M., Arnab, S., Mechanics under the perspective of self-determination theory to foster motivation in digital game based learning (2016) Simulation & Gaming, Learning Mechanics and Game Mechanics under the Perspective of Self-Determination Theory to Foster Motivation in Digital Game Based Learning; Zhonggen, Y., (2019) A Meta-Analysis of Use of Serious Games in Education 2019; Pho, A., Dinscore, A., Game-based learning overview and definition (2015) Tips Trends Instr Technol Commitee, pp. 1-5; We Are IntechOpen, the World's Leading Publisher of Open Access Books Built by Scientists, for Scientists TOP 1, , Access O; Li, J., Ma, S., Ma, L., (2012) The Study on the Effect of Educational Games for the Development of Students ' Logic-mathematics of Multiple Intelligence, 33, pp. 1749-1752; Zirawaga, V.S., (2017) Gaming in Education: Using Games As A Support Tool to Teach History, 8, pp. 55-64; Noemí, P., Máximo, S.H., (2014) Educational Games for Learning, 2, pp. 230-238; Bashova, K., Pachovski, V., (2016) Visual Novel; Pratama, D., Gunarti, W., Wardani, W., Akbar, T., (2018) The Visual Elements Strength in Visual Novel Game Development As the Main Appeal, 33, pp. 326-333; Laugwitz, B., Held, T., Schrepp, M., Construction and evaluation of a user experience questionnaire (2008) Symposium of the Austrian HCI and Usability Engineering Group, pp. 63-76. , November.

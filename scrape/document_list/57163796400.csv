To meet the needs of salary calculation, every working day all employees are required to attend work during work hours and after work hours using a fingerprint machine. With a fingerprint machine that is currently owned and the number of employees of more than 3000 people causes long queues during the attendance process. Not to mention if there are technical problems such as unreadable fingerprints or machine fingerprint errors, the attendance process will take longer. This can cause the start time to work backwards and not on time. Therefore we need a attendance system that can speed up the attendance process. The purpose of building a smartphone-based attendance system is so that employees can directly attend attendance via smartphones owned without having to attend through the fingerprint machine. The presence system will be built using android technology and intranet wifi networks. Intranet wifi networks are used to connect smartphones and servers. The intranet network was also chosen so that the attendance system coverage is limited to the PT XYZ factory environment, in order to avoid absent employees from outside the company. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Lack of management and maintenance of model led to duplicate or redundant model, ineffective reuse, and aggravated maintenance effort. Model matching or similarity is the core of operations management for different models such as models of evolution, consolidation, and retrieval. An accurate identification of the similarity and differences between the elements of the matched models leads to an accurate model of matching, which, in turn, leads to better management models. In this paper, we presents Tree Edit Distance Algorithm to assess the similarity of UML Class Diagram based on XML document of model. Experiment results shows that the algorithm provides similarity value based on number operations (rename, insert, delete) required to transform a class diagram structure into another class diagram. © 2015, American Scientific Publishers.

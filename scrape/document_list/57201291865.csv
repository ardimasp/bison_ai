It is also to propose a follow-up recommendation on the factors that inhibit the implementation of the ISMS. Data collection is derived from questionnaires to 182 respondents from users in data center operation (DCO) at bca, Indonesian telecommunication international (telin), and data centre division at Indonesian Ministry of Health. We analysing data collection with multiple linear regression analysis and paired t-test. The results are multiple factors which inhibiting the implementation of the ISMS from the three organizations which has implement and operate the ISMS, ISMS documentation management, and continual improvement. From this research, we concluded that the processes of implementation in ISMS is the necessity of the role of all parties in succeeding the implementation of the ISMS continuously. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data acquisition; Linear regression; Security of data; Surveys; Data center operations; Data collection; Documentation management; Implement and operate; Information security management systems; Multi factors; Multiple factors; Multiple linear regression analysis; Information management",,,,,"Pavlov, G., Karakneva, J., Information Security Managemnet System in Organization (2011) Trakia Journal of Sciences, 9, pp. 20-25; Whitman, M.E., Mattord, H.J., (2011) Principles of Information Security (Fourth Edition), , (United States of America: Cengage Learning); (2012) International Standard ISO/IEC 27000 Second Edition 2012-12-0, , (Switzerland); Hai, Hui-Lin, Kuei-Min, W., The critical success factors assessment of ISO 27001 certification in computer organization by test-retest reliability (2014) African Journal of Business Management, 8 (17), pp. 705-716; Sora, Daniel, Securing IT Networks with ISMS Family of Standards (2012) Defense Resources Management in the 21st Century, , ISO 27001 Series; (2013) International Standard ISO/IEC 27001 Second Edition 2013-10-01, , (Switzerland); Fajar, A.N., Budiardjo, E.K., Hasibuan, Z.A., (2012) System Architecture in the Dynamic Environment Based on Commonality and Variability Business Processes, , (ICCM); Landau, Sabine, Everitt, Brian, S., (2004) A Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using SPSS, , (London: Chapman amp; Hall/CRC Press LLC)",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","2nd International Conference on Computing and Applied Informatics 2017, ICCAI 2017","28 November 2017 through 30 November 2017",,135467,17426588,,,,"English","J.

Its purpose is to analysis the multi factors that are inhibiting in implementation of the ISMS. It is also to propose a follow-up recommendation on the factors that inhibit the implementation of the ISMS In the previous research data were collected from questionnaires to 182 respondents from DCO at BCA, NIT PT TELIN, and DATIN Centre at Ministry of Health Republic of Indonesia. The result from the questionnaires ie 1) implement and operate the ISMS, 2) ISMS documentation management, and 3) continual improvement. This research is focusing on conducting depth interviews to the experts who already have experience in implementing the ISMS in the organizations in Indonesia.

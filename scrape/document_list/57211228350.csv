In Samarinda there are not many universities who applies E-Learning like SPB Airlangga. SPB Airlangga is a university who focuses on TI (Teknik Informatika). E-learning has evolved from just an online course into an advanced technology in material distribution and course discussions without being bound by permanent time and place. SPB STMIK Airlangga Samarinda has applied e-learning that is already used by lecturers and students as the media for online course, included in them are discussion for lecture courses, tasks arrangement and online tests. In learing models such as these, lecturers, students and the educational organization need smarter tools to deal with the problem of ongoing feedback from the education process. It is to offer a learning environment that can enhance the learning effectiveness of new learning modes as well as organizations and efficient institutional resources to gain knowledge on any topic, So an evaluation how the effect of implementing e-learning in the learning process in SPB STMIK Airlangga Samarinda using the evaluation through evaluating system user acceptance is done. The activity of this research is the evaluation of several variables related to user behavior towards the use of e-learning in SPB STMIK Airlangga Samarinda where the placing of the variables i done through TAM approach (Ibrahim, Leng et al. 2018). This research will measure the following independent variables: (1). Perceived Of Usefulness/POU) (2). Perceived Ease Of Use/PEOU, (3). Attitude Towards Using, these dependent variables: (4). Actual Use. The results of this research are expected to provide useful material for the development of science and research in the scope of e-learning and everything related to all aspects that influence it. The results of the evaluation of the use of E-Learning in the STMIK SPB Airlangga Samarinda Lecture System were obtained from the use of data collection through a questionnaire method obtained directly from students and lecturers at STMIK SPB Airlangga Samarinda, and the produced TAM factors assumed to influence the use of e-learning systems at SPB STMIK Airlangga Samarinda are 1). Perceived Ease Of Use/PEOU, 2). Perceived Of Usefulness/POU, 3). Attitude Towards Using/ATU, and 4).

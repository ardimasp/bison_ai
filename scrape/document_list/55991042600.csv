This research proposed a model of effort estimation for web application developed using object oriented approach. In the proposed model, researcher combined method for functional size measurement of object oriented based web application named OOmFPWeb by Abrahao and web metric by Mendes for web application size measurement. The estimation process was done by using CBR method with considering 3 projects that are most similar to the project being estimated. To evaluate the proposed model, comparison between OOmFPWeb as the only variable that affect web effort estimation, web metric by Mendes and the proposed model were done. The evaluation result showed that effort estimation for web application with the proposed model is better than just using OOmFPWeb or web metric from Mendes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","FHSWebEE; Functional size estimation; Hypermedia size estimation; Web effort estimation",,,,,,"Ginige, A., Murugesan, S., Web engineering: An introduction (2001) IEEE Multimedia, 8 (1), pp. 14-18. , January/March; Deshpande, Y., Hansen, S., Web engineering: Creating a discipline among disciplines (2001) IEEE Multimedia, pp. 82-87; Offutt, J., Quality attributes of web software applications (2002) IEEE Software, 19 (2), pp. 25-32. , March/April; Mendes, E., Mosley, N., (2006) Web Engineering, , 1st ed.

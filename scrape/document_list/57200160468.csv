In most cases a fiber optic network has been implemented using clustering method, where this method assumed inefficient due to the utilization of fiber optic that is not maximized, and the numbers of the Distribution Point used is more. Thus, this paper proposed new design using Voronoi diagrams in selecting the strategic location of the Distribution Point. By utilizing an image from Google map and html code, we created polygons of Voronoi based on the coordinate point of the candidate's location. The results are getting a value reduction/efficiency in context the use of the Distribution Point is 48%, reduction of unused fiber optics is from 171.23% to 39.72%, and cost efficiency is 50.39%. © 2018 The Authors.

However, selecting the required disaster recovery model based on functionality or usability, and the financial budget in manufacturing industry is not easy. It requires a method that can be used for technology selection. Top management has options for making decisions based on subjective assessments to select the appropriate disaster recovery model. An information systems typically support decision making process by offering the best alternative solutions. Multi Criteria Decision Making approach using Analytic Hierarchy Process method is proposed to support the decision support system.Results of this study are to provide a model of disaster recovery that can be chosen appropriately in accordance with desired criteria. © 2018 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.","Analytical hierarchy process; Disaster recovery; Multi criteria decision making",,,,,,"Afif, M.F., Suryono, T., Implementasi Disaster Recovery Plan dengan sistem Fail Over menggunakan drbd dan Heartbeat pada data center fkip uns (2013) Ijns-Indonesian J.

As the development of information technology and the use of data that increasingly large, it will be a main factor that affects to the company's business. The amount of data that must be processed both at headquarters and other branch offices make the process of data exchange become the main issue in term of speed and delay. Due to data exchange being a top priority in the company, often the WAN network bandwidth used by the file system, email system, proxy, web system becomes peak or full during peak hours thus slowing down accessing file or email system. One method to reduce bandwidth usage is almost full is to use WAN Optimization tools. WAN Optimization has several functions, including Data Streamlining, Transport Streamlining, and Application Streamlining. The purpose of this study is to analyze performance network when WAN optimization was applied in the system. Data is taken from simulated file transfers conducted several days and at different hours. Data were analyzed using Wireshark tools and calculation formula. The results can be seen if there is a significant increasing performance, delay become better from 287 ms to 0.604 ms for file size 93 MB and jitter increased 12.4% better. It can be concluded that with the optimization of WAN, the process of data transfer becomes more efficient both in bandwidth and time during working hours. © 2017 The Authors.

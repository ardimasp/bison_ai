The method used is by comparing samples of application development projects before Telkomsigma implemented CMMI and after implemented CMMI. In gathering projects information, author observed documentations related to sample projects, organization policies and procedures and discussions with related parties. The data that has been received, is analysed with CMMI practice to measure its maturity levels. The result of the measurement is comparison of CMMI practice goals achievement before and after Telkomsigma's CMMI implementation from measured samples projects. The conclusion that the author can get is, CMMI implementation can improve Telkomsigma's application development process. © 2014 SERSC.","Application development; CMMI; Practice; Process area",,,,,,"Ahern, D.M., Clouse, A., Richard, T., CMMI Distilled: A Practical Introduction to Integrated Process Improvement (2008) Addison Wesley Professional; Benefit of CMMI (2013), http://cmmiinstitute.com/results/benefits-of-cmmi/, Accessed on August 20; Chrissis, M.B., Mike, K., Sandy, S., CMMI for Development: Guideline for Process Integration and Product Improvement"", 3rd e (2011) SEI Series in Software Engineering; CMMI Institute Published Appraisal Results (PARS): PT Sigma Cipta Caraka (telkomsigma) for Development projects executed in Finance and Non Banking Solution BU, Banking Solution BU, Product and Technology BU, , https://sas.cmmiinstitute.com/pars/, Capability Maturity Model Integration Institute (Accessed on October 18, 2013); ""CMMI for Development"" (2010) Software Engineering Process Management Program, , Version 1.3; CMMI for Systems Engineering/Software Engineering/Integrated Product and Process Development/Supplier Sourcing (2002), (SEI 2002b), Version 1.1 Continuous Representation (CMU/SEI-2002-TR-011, ESCTR- 2002-011), Pittsburgh, PA: Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University; Constantinescu, R., Mihnea, I., Capability Maturity Model Integration (2007) Journal of Applied Quantitative Methods, pp. 31-37. , No. 1; Reena, D., Ujana, C., Integrating CMMI Maturity Level-3 In Traditional Software Development Process (2012) International Journal of Software Engineering &Applications (IJSEA), 3 (1), pp. 17-26; Kohlegger, M., Maier, R., Thalmann, S., Understanding Maturity Models Results of a Structured Content Analysis (2009) Proceeding of I-KNOW'09 and I-SEMANTIC '09, pp. 51-61; Honda, N., Shigeru, Y., Success Factors to Achieve Excellent Quality: CMMI Level 5 Organizations Research Report (2012) Software Quality Professiona ProQuest Computing, p. 21; O'Brien, J., Marakas, G., Introduction to Information Systems (2009) McGraw-Hill Companies, , 15th Edition; O'Toole, P., Sampling the SCAMPI Sampling Rules or Trying to Explain the Unexplainable.

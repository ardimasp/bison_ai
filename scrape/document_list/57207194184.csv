This matter is what drive the telecommunication industries to upgrade their ser-vices to accommodate the orders of the customers. Thus, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) with the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) is the solution for the problem, because it is able to be flexible and follows the ever changing business process and needs of the customers. With the micro services, the system will be able to be modified partly on what needs to be added or fixed, it does not require the service to be re-built from scratch. The implementation of the new system based on ESB is a new approach that can be considered for ordering system, the implementation in this case is able to meet the management’s expectation of success rate. © IAEME Publication","Enterprise Service Bus; Microservices; Order Management System; Service Oriented Architecture; Telecommunication",,,,,,"Karimi, N., Oldooz, Modiri, Enterprise Integration using Service Oriented Architecture (2011) Adv.

This research was conducted to examine the factors that influence learning interest through Youtube media on Information Technology students at Bina Nusantara University. In addition, this research is to ascertain what factors influence directly or indirectly through YouTube media learning. This study uses a TAM model that aims to determine interest in using Youtube as a learning resource. Data samples were collected from 100 respondents of the Department of Information Technology at Bina Nusantara University. The results obtained from the installation of structural equation models in the sample indicate that behavioral intention is significantly influenced by attitude to use Youtube as a Learning Media for Information Technology. The overall findings show that students start with a motivation, then develop an attitude to use youtube, and driven by that, it's then go to intention to use youtube as a learning media for Information Technology. © 2019 IEEE.","Information Technology Learning Resources; TAM; Youtube","Information systems; Information use; Learning systems; Students; Behavioral intention; Behaviour intentions; Intention to use; Learning materials; Learning media; Learning resource; Structural equation models; Technology learning; Engineering education",,,,,"Barnes, K., Marateo, R.C., Ferris, S.P., Teaching and learning with the net generation (2007) Innovate: Journal of Online Education, 3 (4); Shifman, L., An anatomy of a youtube meme (2012) New Media&society, 14 (2), pp. 187-203; Sharoff, L., Integrating youtube into the nursing curriculum OJIN: The Online Journal of Issue in Nursing, 16 (3); Simamora, N.R.H., Kep, M., Buku ajar pendidikan dalam keperawatan (2009) EGC; Burke, S.C., Snyder, S., Rager, R.C., An assessment of faculty usage of YouTube as a teaching resource (2009) Internet Journal of Allied Health Sciences and Practice, 7 (1), p. 8; Davis, F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and user acceptance of information technology (1989) MIS Quartely, 13 (3), pp. 319-340; Fishbein, M., Ajzen, I., Belief, attitude, intention, and behavior: An introduction to theory and research (1975) Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley; Cheng, B., Wang, M., Moormann, J., Olaniran, B.A., Cheng, N.S., The effects of organizational learning environment factors on e-learning acceptance (2012) Computers&Education, 58 (3), pp. 885-899; Lee, B.C., Yoon, J.O., Lee, I., Learners acceptance of elearning in South.

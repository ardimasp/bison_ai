One of the alternative materials that have been widely used is the Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) aggregates. The RAP aggregates are derived from the crushed and screened pavement materials that contain asphalt and aggregates. This material is usually combined with natural aggregates and virgin asphalt binder to construct a new pavement. There have been numerous positive feedbacks in using this material although RAP aggregates also have certain weaknesses, such as questionable interaction between virgin and recycled materials and increased stiffness of RAP binder. Moreover, there has been a push on using rubber as an additive to asphalt binder to improve the welfare of rubber farmers. This research combines the usage of both latex and RAP as the ingredients to design hot mix asphalt (HMA) as latex could help in improving the flexibility of HMA and the interaction between the virgin and recycled materials. The main objective of this research is to find a suitable percentage of RAP aggregates to be used in HMA with certain percentage of latex as the binder additive. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","aggregates; hot mix asphalt; pavement; Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement","Aggregates; Asphalt pavements; Binders; Bins; Latexes; Pavements; Reclamation; Recycling; Rubber; Alternative materials; Hot mix asphalt; Natural aggregate; Pavement construction; Pavement material; Reclaimed asphalt pavements; Recycled materials; Rubberized asphalt; Asphalt",,,,,"Chesner, W.H., Collins, R.J., MacKay, M.H., (1998), (Washington, DC, United States) User Guidelines for Waste and Byproduct Materials in Pavement Construction; Al-Qadi, I.L., Elseifi, M., Carpenter, S.H., (2007), (Urbana, IL) Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement - A Literature Review; Pradyumna, T.A., Mittal, A., Jain, P.K., Characterization of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) for Use in Bituminous Road Construction (2013) Procedia - Soc.

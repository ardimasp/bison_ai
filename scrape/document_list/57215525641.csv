The evaluated exertion in the UCP method gets from the increase between the UCP esteem and the Effort Value (ER). The expense of ER is the extent of structure of working hours required for each utilization. Determination of ER values only uses data software development projects with simple linear regression analysis. However, most researchers refer to the proposed ER value without questioning or reviewing the ER value. This study evaluates the ER values for software development projects in the business field, namely the Health Surveillance Application. In conducting this research, we need several data on software development projects in the Health Surveillance field from this data. We can find the ER value by analyzing correlation and linear equations. The final results of this study get the benefit of ER 8.0. This price is lower than the quantity suggested by past scientists. Decreasing the ER value can reduce the estimated amount of the effort, then the decrease in estimated business value will reduce the resources needed for software development. May be due to a development project as a component or framework that facilitates project developmen, this is possible for several reasons, including more advanced software engineering technology, rapid growth. © 2019 IEEE.","health surveillance application; Size of software; software metrics; use case point","Application programs; Computer aided software engineering; Health; Monitoring; Regression analysis; Business value; Development project; Health surveillances; Simple linear regression analysis; Software development projects; Software metrics; Use case points; Working hours; Software design",,,,,"https://www.maxmanroe.com/ini-penyebab-kegagalan-startupmenurut-dua-tokoh-startup-indonesia.html; Group, S., (2011) Reports of Chaos, , http:/standishgroup.com/news, Accessed on 1 June 2013; Tokey, Steve, Steve, (2010) Software Return: Maximizing Your Software Investment Return, , Prentice-Hall; Galorath, D., Evans, M.W., (2008) Sizing Software, Estimate, and Risk Management, , Auerbach, in; Endy, M., (2011) Estimated Project of Software, , http:/software.endy.muhardin.com/estimate-probesoftware/, Retrieved March 7, 2013; Ochodek, M., Nawrocki, J., Kwarciak, K., (2011) Simplifying Estimation Effort Based on Use Case Points, , Sciencedirect; Karner, G., (1993) Resource Estimation for Objectory Projects, , Objective System SF AB; Clemmons, R.K., (2006) Use Case Point Project Estimation, , Technical Services Diversified, Inc; https://mx.123dok.com/document/7q01eggzsoftware-projects-effort-estimation-using-use-case-points-method-in-the-context-of-project-management-bodyof-knowledge, Retrieved from; http://elearning.upnjatim.ac.id/courses/REKAYASAPERANGKATLUNAKPAGI/document/slidekuliah/Software_Process_Model_1.ppt?cidReq=REKAYASAPERANGKATLUNAKPAGI, Accessed on July 12, 2013; Robiola, G., Ricardo, O., (2008) Using Case to Early Estimate Effort with Simpler Metrics, , Springer publishing house London Limited; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_Case_Points#Unadjusted_Use_Case_Weight_(UUCW)_2",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","4th International Conference on Informatics and Computing, ICIC 2019","23 October 2019 through 24 October 2019",,157590,,9781728122076,,,"English","Proc.

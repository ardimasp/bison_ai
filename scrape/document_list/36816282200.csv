At the beginning of 2019, the PT.DKB loyalty program changed from a physical membership card to an electronic membership card which support is provided via a website. This study is done to analyze the factors affecting the loyalty of PT.DKB customers with changes in the loyalty program to electronic membership with website-based usage. The factors analyzed in this study are Website Quality, E-Service Quality, Ease of Use, and Perceived Usefulness with the target Customer Loyalty variable. The study was conducted with a total sample of 155 respondents. The analysis is performed by testing validity using Item to Total Pearson Correlation with a correlation level ≥ 0.5, reliability testing using Cronbach's alpha with a minimum value of Cronbach's alpha ≥ 0.6, and hypothesis tests with the condition that a hypothesis is accepted if P-value ≤ 0.05. The test results performed with the SmartPLS application indicate that there are two indicators which correlation level is less than 0.5 both of those indicators are removed from the next step of the test. Reliability tests result in values above 0.6 for all variables. Hypothesis tests performed show that four of the six hypotheses were accepted in this study. The results of this study indicate that the Perceived Usefulness factor directly influences the loyalty of PT.DKB customers and indirectly that the loyalty of PT.DKB customers are influenced by Website Quality and EService Quality. From the results of this study, there are three factors which influenced the customers loyalty of PT.DKB. Those factors are: Website Quality, E-Service Quality, and Perceived Usefulness by increasing the function regarding these factors, PT.DKB could retain and increase their customers loyalty. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Affecting Factors; Customer Loyalty; Electronic Membership; SmartPLS; Website Based Membership",,,,,,"Abu-alhaija, A.

With the recent rapid use of gamification for e-learning, an interesting open question for educators is, can it motivate and improve the achievement of students? The purpose of this study is to measure the effect of gamification on e-learning to support learning achievement and learning motivation. This is done by comparing the traditional learning method (class) and the method of e-learning gamification. The researcher will develop a prototype of e-learning gamification to support his research. There are several game mechanics conducted by researchers into e-learning such as, points, levels, challenges, and leaderboards. The data of this research were taken from the questionnaires distribution and the result of study report of 24 students in one of junior high school. Questionnaires were made into two kinds, pre-questionnaire and post-questionnaire respectively for traditional method and e-learning gamification. While the learning reports are obtained from student’s semester report and report during the use of e-learning gamification. The data is processed with the help of software SmartPLS v.3.2.6 and Microsoft Excel 2016 and analyzed using paired t-test. The results obtained are e-learning gamification does not give a positive effect or improvement on student motivation in terms of behavioral, emotional and cognitive. Futhermore, e-learning gamification also does not give a positive effect on improving student's learning achievement. The role of teacher and one time use of e-learning gamification are the causes that e-learning gamification does not give a positive impact. The challenge for further research is, how we substitute the teacher role. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","E-Learning; Game mechanics; Gamification; Learning achievement; Learning motivation",,,,,,"Februari).

This research is aimed to propose an alternative solution for congestion problem in Jakarta using Cased-Based Reasoning (CBR) approach on Pejompongan area. The CBR integrated model analyzes congestion at a given point in a particular hour to identify the same case. The Cased-Based Management (CBM) algorithm approach is used to capture transient problems and ultimately reduce case base cases for their contribution to long-term maintenance. Congestion data is obtained from CCTV cameras via website lewatmana.com in some strategic areas. With that data, we use CBR's integrated model to adjust traffic time for traffic flow to be optimized so that congestion will decompose. The results of this study can be used by relevant government agencies and policymakers in Jakarta to formulate the best solution to solve the congestion problem in the Indonesian capital. Image analysis at nights and bad weather conditions become a limitation and also the integration with traffic lights control in this paper that can be a new topic for further research. © 2018 IEEE.","Case based reasoning;

The number of emarketplaces operating in Indonesia continues to increase over time. This condition makes the competition in e-marketplace business becomes more competitive. To survive, e-marketplace must be able to maintain and increase their number of customers. Basically, customers in the e-marketplace business are not just buyers, the sellers who market their goods and/or services in the e-marketplace are also customers of the e-marketplace. Some constraints experienced by the seller can cause the seller to leave the e-marketplace, this can be a serious threat for the e-marketplace that only acts as an intermediary. Although many studies have been conducted to determine the factors affecting buyer loyalty, but differences in objective and technical experience of buyers and sellers cause studies conducted on buyers can not be applied directly to sellers. Based on these backgrounds, then conducted research to find the factors that affect the loyalty of sellers in e-marketplace business. The research model was established and developed based on some previous research. Some factors such as efficiency, security and privacy, communication, reliability, information, value added services, image, cost, and promotion are examined to obtain answers to research objectives. The sample in this research is taken from the seller in e-marketplace in Indonesia. The method of analysis used in this research is Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results of this study found that the satisfaction, image, cost, promotion and value added services have a positive impact on the loyalty of the seller.

Along with this development, the use of information technology, which is the basis of the information system, should be considered as a very useful tool to survive in the competition in the hospitality industry. Previous studies have widely discussed the role of information systems at the strategic level. Including the assertion of Nicholas Carr that is 'IT Doesn't Matter'. This assertion need to be tested by the extent to which the maturity of the use of information systems through its elements could affect the company's strategic performance measured from the five perspective of Kaplan's Business Balanced Scorecard in the hospitality sector in Indonesia.

The paper will further research on the relationship of the total unit sold and the changes in price with the market share of a specific company in the industry in hope that this research may help company to decide on product strategy based on whether the existing products’ contribution to the market shares is necessary or should the product need to be discontinued and replaced. The report will measure the relationship between the total products sold and the changes in price with the market share, which is derived from the proportion of values compared to the total market value of the skin care market. A Multiple Regression analysis was used to formulate the relationship using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimation method. It can be concluded that, number of unit sold of each product does have relationship to the market share regression model regardless its contribution’s significance. While prices changes do not significantly impacting the changes in the market shares, this can be caused by the loyalty of the customer towards the brand. In other word, these loyal customers will buy the product no matter how much the price has changed. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

Several factors such as information quality, firm's reputation, perceived ease of payment, sites design, benefit of online shopping, and trust that influence customer decision to purchase from e-commerce sites were analyzed. Factors such as those mentioned above, which are commonly considered influencing purhasing decision through online shopping in other countries were hypothesized to be true in the case of Indonesia. A random sample comprised of 171 Indonesian people who have been buying goods/services through e-commerce sites at least once, were collected via online questionnaires. To test the hypothesis, the data were examined using Structural Equations Modeling (SEM) which is basically a combination of Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and linear Regression. The results suggest that information quality, perceived ease of payment, benefits of online shopping, and trust affect online purchase decision significantly. Close attention need to be placed on these factors to increase online sales. The most significant influence comes from trust. Indonesian people still lack of trust toward online commerce, so it is very important to gain customer trust to increase sales. E-commerce's business owners are encouraged to develop sites that can meet the expectation of potential customer, provides ease of payment system, provide detailed and actual information and responsible for customer personal information and transaction records. This paper outlined the key factors influencing online shopping intention in Indonesia and pioneered the building of an integrated research framework to understand how consumers make purchase decision toward online shopping; a relatively new way of shopping in the country. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

Several factors were considered which are: the effectiveness of EMR systems (performance expectancy), ease of use and learning system of EMR (effort expectancy), the condition of facilities which facilitate EMR system (facilitating condition), the quality of information provided by the system (information quality), and culture organization (sharing knowledge). Three moderate variables were also introduced such as age, period of employment and expertise in using a computer. The research was carried out by taking samples from the hospitals that have implemented EMR in the country. The data obtained then was tested and analyzed using the framework of Structural Equations Modeling (SEM), to test the hypothesis in two steps, i.e., measurements modeling using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural modeling, using simultaneous linear regression. The findings of the study indicated that of the five factors in the test (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, quality information, facilitating condition, sharing knowledge), were all have impact on the level of user satisfaction on EMR. Practical implications of the findings, among others, would be that these important factors should always be considered as element of strategy in developing better information systems. © 2005 - 2013 JATIT & LLS.

Several factors such as information quality, firm s reputation, perceived ease of payment, sites design, benefit of online shopping, trust that influence customer decision to purchase from e-commerce sites were analyzed. Design/methodology/approach Factors such as those mentioned above, which are commonly considered influencing purhasing decision through online shopping in other countries were hypothesized to be true in the case of indonesia. A random sample comprised of 171 Indonesian people who have been buying goods/services through ecommerce sites at least once, were collected via online questionnaires. To test the hypothesis, the data were examined using Structural Equations Modeling (SEM) which is basically a combination of Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and linear regression. Findings The results suggest that information quality, perceived ease of payment, benefits of online shopping, and trust affect online purchase decision significantly. Close attention need to be placed on these factors to increase online sales. The most significant influence comes from trust. Indonesian people still lack of trust toward online commerce, so it is very important to gain customer trust to increase sales. Practical implications E-commerce s business owners are encouraged to develop sites that can meet the expectation of potential customer, provides ease of payment system, provide detailed and actual information and responsible for customer personal information and transaction records. Originality/value This paper outlined the key factors influencing online shopping intention in Indonesia and pioneered the building of an integrated research framework to understand how consumers make purchase decision toward online shopping, a relatively new way of shopping in the country. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Confirmatory factor analysis; Factors; Indonesia; Online purchase decision; Regression",,,,,,"http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats3.htm, accessed at 07 December 2011; (2010) Online Transactions in Indonesia Translucent USD 35 Trillion, , http://www.banningbusinesscenter.com/online-transactions-in-indonesia- translucent-usd-35-trillion.html, Alam.

Estimates of economic growth in the coming year in a country has important roles, among others as a benchmark in determining business plans for business entities, and the basis for devising government fiscal policy. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been increasingly recognized as a good forecasting tool in various fields. Its nature that can mimic the workings of the human brain makes it flexible for non-linear and non-parametric data. GDP growth forecasting techniques using ANN has been widely used in various countries, such as the United States, Canada, Germany, Austria, Iran, China, Japan and others. In Indonesia, forecasting of GDP is only done by government institutions, namely National Planning Board, using macroeconomic model. In this study, ANN is used as a tool for forecasting GDP growth in Indonesia, using some variables, such as GDP growth in the two previous periods, population growth rate, inflation, exchange rate and political stability and security conditions in Indonesia. Results from this study indicate that ANN forecasts GDP relatively better than the one issued by the government. Further study would be to use ANN to predict other economic indicators. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.

Estimates of economic growth in the coming year in a country has important roles, among others as a benchmark in determining business plans for business entities, and the basis for devising government fiscal policy. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been increasingly recognized as a good forecasting tool in various fields. Its nature that can mimic the workings of the human brain makes it flexible for non-linear and non-parametric data. GDP growth forecasting techniques using ANN has been widely used in various countries, such as the United States, Canada, Germany, Austria, Iran, China, Japan and others. In Indonesia, forecasting of GDP is only done by government institutions, namely National Planning Board, using macroeconomic model. In this study, ANN is used as a tool for forecasting GDP growth in Indonesia, using some variables, such as GDP growth in the two previous periods, population growth rate, inflation, exchange rate and political stability and security conditions in Indonesia. Results from this study indicate that ANN forecasts GDP relatively better than the one issued by the government. Further study would be to use ANN to predict other economic indicators. © 2010 IEEE.","ANN; Forecasting; GDP growth","ANN; Artificial Neural Network; Austria; Business plans; Economic growths; Economic indicators; Economic production; Exchange rates; Fiscal policies; Forecasting techniques; Forecasting tools; GDP growth; Germany; Government institutions; Gross domestic products; Human brain; Indonesia; Macro-economic models; National planning; Non-linear; Non-parametric; Political stability; Population growth rates; Economics; Forecasting; Neural networks; Telecommunication; Population statistics",,,,,"Angelini, E., Camba-Mendez, G., Giannone, D., Runstler, G., Reichlin, L., (2008) Short-Term Forecasts of Euro Area GDP Growth, , European Central Bank, Germany; (2000) Indikator Ekonomi: Buletin Statistik Bulanan, , Badan Pusat Statistik, edisi Desember 2000, ISSN 0126.2319, Nomor Publikasi 04400.0012; (2005) Indikator Ekonomi: Buletin Statistik Bulanan, , Badan Pusat Statistik, edisi Desember 2005, ISSN 0126.2319, Nomor Publikasi 06330.0512; (2009) Indikator Ekonomi: Buletin Statistik Bulanan, , Badan Pusat Statistik, edisi Desember 2009, ISSN 0126.2319, Nomor Publikasi 07330.1003; (2008) Bank Indonesia Official Website [Online], , www.bi.go.id, Available: 2010, April 01; (1974) Rencana Pembangunan Lima Tahun II (Repelita II) 1974-1978 [Online], , www.bps.go.id, Bappenas, Available: 2010, Maret 31; (1979) Rencana Pembangunan Lima Tahun III (Repelita III) 1979-1983 [Online], , www.bps.go.id, Bappenas, Available: 2010, Maret 31; (1984) Rencana Pembangunan Lima Tahun IV (Repelita IV) 1984-1988 [Online], , www.bps.go.id, Bappenas, Available: 2010, Maret 31; (1989) Rencana Pembangunan Lima Tahun V (Repelita V) 1989-1993 [Online], , www.bps.go.id, Bappenas, Available: 2010, Maret 31; (1994) Rencana Pembangunan Lima Tahun VI (Repelita VI) 1994-1998 [Online], , www.bps.go.id, Bappenas, Available: 2010, Maret 31; (2000) Program Pembangunan Nasional Lima Tahun (Propenas) 2000-2004 [Online], , www.bps.go.id, Bappenas, Available: 2010, Maret 31; (2001) Studi Pengembangan Indikator Ekonomi Makro [Online], , www.bappenas.go.id, Bappenas, Available: 2010, Maret 24; (2004) Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Nasional (RPJMN) 2004-2009, , Bappenas; Camba-Mendez, G., Kapetanios, G., Smith, R.J., Weale, M.R., (1999) An Automatic Leading Indicator of Economic Activity: Forecasting GDP for European Country, [Online], , http://www.niesr.ac.uk/pubs/dps/dp149.pdf, Available: 2009, December 13; Curran, D., Funke, M., (2006) Taking the Temperature: Forecasting GDP Growth for Mainland China, , Bank of Finland, BOFIT; Demers, F., Dupuis, D., (2005) Forecasting Canadian GDP: Region Spesific Versus Countrywide Information, , Bank of Canada, Canada; Demuth, H., Beale, M., Hagan, M., (2008) Neural Network ToolboxTM 5: User's Guide, , The Math Works, Inc., US; Fauset, L., (1994) Fundamentals of Neural Network: Architectures, Algorithms, and Application, , Prentice-Hall, Inc., New Jersey; (2009) U.S. Gross Domestic Product GDP Forecast [Online], , http://forecasts.org/gdp.htm, Available: 2009, December 10; Giovanis, E., ARIMA and Neural Networks.

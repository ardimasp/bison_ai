In this study, we developed an indoor air quality monitoring system to detect and dispose bad air out of the room. Proposed system applied internet of things concept to do monitoring of air quality for gases of carbon dioxide (CO2) and PM10 gases. The sensors of CO2 and PM10 are connected to Arduino UNO to process analog to digital signal.This system has a mamdani fuzzy logic rule to efficiently set the working interval of exhaust fan. To process fuzzy logic rules, it used Raspberry Pi 3 in this proposed system.Based on result, Proposed System can maintain PM10 and CO2 AQI for safety level in longer periods compared to the system that used sugeno fuzzy logic system. For AQI PM10 values, if using the proposed system in 30 minutes, the interval of safe AQI values obtained in 30 minutes is for 1501 seconds. Whereas the safe AQI value interval obtained with fuzzy sugeno system only 1018 seconds. And for the value of AQI CO2, if using the system in 30 minutes, the interval of safe AQI value obtained in 30 minutes is for 816 seconds. Whereas the safe AQI value interval obtained with fuzzy sugeno system only 686 seconds. © IJSTR 2019.","AQI; Arduino Uno; Exhaust Fan; Fuzzy Logic; Indoor Air Quality; Internet of Things; Raspberry Pi 3",,,,,,"Cincinelli, A., Martellini, T., Indoor Air Quality and Health (2017) International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 14 (11), p. 1286; Kankaria, A., Indoor Air Pollution in India: Implications on Health and its Control (2014) Indian Journal of Community Medicine, 39 (4), pp. 203-207; Marcella, U., The Effect of Indoor Temperature and CO2 Levels on Cognitive Performance of Adult Females in Universitas Building in Saudi Arabia (2017) International Conference-Future Buildings & Districts-Energy Efficiency from Nano to Urban Scale, 122, pp. 451-456; ASHRAE/ANSI Standard 62.I-2013 Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality [Online], , http://www.myiaire.com/product-docs/ultraDRY/ASHRAE62.1.pdf, Available; Mukesh, D.M., Akula, S.K., Automated Indoor Air Quality Monitor and Control (2017) International Journal of Computer Applications, 159 (6), pp. 0975-8887; Malche, T., Maheshwary, P., Internet of Things (IoT) for building smart home system (2017) 2017 International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud), pp. 65-70; Preethicandra, D.M.G., Design of a smart indoor air quality monitoring wireless sensor network for assisted living (2013) IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference(I2MTC); Dobbin, A., The Benefit of kitchen exhaust fan use after cooking-An experimental assesment (2018) Building and Evirontment, 135, pp. 286-296; Kumar, S., Jasuja, A., Air quality monitoring system based on IoT using Raspberry Pi (2017) 2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation, pp. 1341-1346; Shu, M., Tang, M., Yang, M., Wei, N., The Vital Signs Real-Time Monitoring System Based on Internet of Things (2017) 2017 4th International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering, pp. 747-751; Gupta, M.S.D., Patchava, V., Menezes, V., Healthcare based on IoT using Raspberry Pi (2015) 2015 International Conference on Green Computing and Internet of Things, pp. 796-799; Naba, A., (2009) Belajar cepat fuzzy logic menggunakan Matlab, , Yogyakarta: Andi; Suyanto, (2007) Artificial Intelligence, Searching, Planning and Learning, , Bandung: Informatika Bandung; Sharma, V., Two Ways Ducting System Using Fuzzy Logic Control System (2013) 2013 International Journal of Electronics and Communication Engineering & Technology (IJECET); Batubara, S., Analisis Perbandingan Metode Fuzzy Mamdani Dan Fuzzy Sugeno Untuk Penentuan Kualitas Cor Beton Instan (2017) IT Journal Researrch and Development, 2 (1), p. 644",,,,"International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research",,,,,22778616,,,,"English","Int.

Indoor air pollution is 2-5 times larger than outdoors, but people still do not care about it. Currently, people open the window or use an exhaust fan to refresh the air condition inside the room. However, people sometimes are too busy to pay attention to the air quality inside the room. Therefore, automation is required to bring the air quality into the required level. This study discussed indoor air quality monitoring and controlling system that can monitor the air condition and control the air condition using an exhaust fan. This system used the IoT concept in conducting real-time monitoring of carbon dioxide and PM10. The proposed system has fuzzy controls that could adjust the working interval of exhaust fan automatically depends on the concentration of each pollutant. Experiment results show that the proposed system shows excellent performance in controlling indoor air quality in terms of pollutant concentrator, AQI, and processing time to remove the pollutants. © 2019 IEEE.","Fuzzy logic; Indoor air quality; Internet of Things","Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Computer circuits; Fuzzy control; Fuzzy logic; Internet of things; Monitoring; Quality control; Indoor air quality; Indoor air quality monitoring; Processing time; Real time monitoring; Indoor air pollution",,,,,"Cincinelli, A., Martellini, T., Indoor air quality and health (2017) International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 14 (11), p. 1286; Kankaria, A., Indoor airpollution in India: Implications on health and its control (2014) Indian Journal of Community Medicine, 39 (4), pp. 203-207; Marcella, U., The effect of indoor temperature and co2 levels on cognitive performance of adult females in universitas building in Saudi Arabia (2017) International Conference-Future Buildings & Districts-Energy Efficiency from Nano to Urban Scale, 122, pp. 451-456; ASHRAE/ANSI Standard 62.I-2013 Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality [Online], , http://www.myiaire.com/product-docs/ultraDRY/ASHRAE62.1.pdf; Mukesh, D.M., Akula, S.K., Automated indoor air quality monitor and control (2017) International Journal of Computer Applications., 159 (6), pp. 0975-8887; Malche, T., Maheshwary, P., Internet of things (iot) for building smart home system (2017) 2017 International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud), pp. 65-70; Kumar, S., Jasuja, A., Air quality monitoring system based on iot using raspberry pi (2017) 2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation, pp. 1341-1346; Shu, M., Tang, M., Yang, M., Wei, N., The vital signs real-Time monitoring system based on internet of things (2017) 2017 4th International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering, pp. 747-751; Gupta, M.S.D., Patchava, V., Menezes, V., Healthcare based on iot using raspberry pi (2015) 2015 International Conference on Green Computing and Internet of Things, pp. 796-799; Preethicandra, D.M.G., Design of a smart indoor air quality monitoring wireless sensor network for assisted living (2013) IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference(I2MTC); Dobbin, A., The benefit of kitchen exhaust fan use after cooking -An experimental assessment (2018) Building and Environment, 135, pp. 286-296; Sharma, V., Two ways ducting system using fuzzy logic control system (2013) 2013 International Journal of Electronics and Communication Engineering & Technology (IJECET).; Naba, A., (2009) Belajar Cepat Fuzzy Logic Menggunakan Matlab, , Yogyakarta, Andi; Suyanto, (2007) Artificial Intelligence, Searching, Planning and Learning, , Bandung, Informatika Bandung",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","7th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology, ICoICT 2019","24 July 2019 through 26 July 2019",,151985,,9781538680520,,,"English","Int.

The traditional waterfall methodology is commonly known with its limitations with its inflexible and non-user-centric approach. Thus, to overcome waterfall limitation, other methodology can be performed in system development. Scrum methodology is said to be a new breakthrough to overcome classic waterfall methodology limitations. In order to overcome waterfall limitations, Scrum methodology can be combined with IBM Design Thinking to provide the best result as both concept build on user-centric concept. This research will be discussing how to combine and the advantages of combination of Scrum and IBM Design Thinking in order to overcome the Waterfall's limitations. This research will cover system development with scrum methodologies that will be combined with IBM Design Thinking concept and tools in related Dashboard and Report System development. This paper will not cover the old waterfall detailed process and will only discussed it's limitations. Scrum and IBM Design Thinking both are user-centric frameworks that can be used by system developers to help them to have a better understanding of their user. This research shows that scrum that complimented with IBM Design Thinking delivers better results than Waterfall methodologies. Both Scrum and IBM Design Thinking overcame the Waterfall's methodology limitation which leads to better result for all team involved. © 2020 Little Lion Scientific.

With the advancement of mass digital payment, IFMIS must also be able to include this practice to maintain the efficiency of state finance operation. In line with demands for efficiency and transparency, shared service centers are also increasingly becoming a common practice in government. Therefore, in an effort to get the full benefits of IFMIS investment in Indonesia, this paper designs one of business architectures for shared service-mass payment management of the Indonesia state finance based on the TOGAF-ADM framework. With this design, it is recommended that various mass payments such as payments for payrolls, government credit cards, official travel costs, common expenses and social assistances can be done more efficiently and transparently and consolidated in a shared service center. Hence, millions of mass payments which are previously carried out individually by thousands of working units across Indonesia could be simplified into smaller number of consolidated payments executed by a shared service center. It is also transforming millions of manual operation processes into much more efficient digital operation processes, maximizing the benefit of collaboration between state owned information systems with the availability of private information systems which are becoming very advanced. This proposed end-state business architectures obviously enhance the efficiency and transparency of state financial operation. This is the contribution of this paper, in addition to contributing to architectural enterprises of digital government in state financial sector which are very complex and still progress unevenly in many countries. © 2020 Little Lion Scientific.

Customers are very active in assessing various businesses that exist through various ways, including through social media. Seeing this phenomenon many companies have begun using social media to reach their customers. A connection with customers through social media must be supported by Social CRM. Social CRM is a business strategy to engage customers through social media by building their trust and loyalty. There is one company in Indonesia that is good in the application of CRM, namely PT. Gojek Indonesia. Gojek is a startup company which became the first startup in Indonesia that holds decacorn status. Gojek has made Twitter as a platform for social CRM. Application of social CRM is not that easy. Customers will be free to criticize and vent their emotions through social media. In this case, writers are interesting to find out the factors that are the strength of Gojek in carrying out Social CRM activities through social media Twitter. This research uses factor analysis techniques. The population used in this study are @GojekIndonesia’s Twitter followers. The results showed that there are 2 new components that make up social CRM at PT. Gojek Indonesia. The first factor is the ""customer hearing"" which represents the factors of listening, embracing, greetings and responses. The second factor is ""Serving Customer"" which represents supporting, energizing and talking factors. Based on the loading factors, the main strength of PT.

Based on data released by databoks.id the three biggest e-commerce sites in Indonesia are Tokopedia, Bukalapak, and Shopee. In keeping its market competitive, e-commerce must know effective ways of satisfying customer wants and needs. A huge number of monthly visits prove that customer satisfaction in online business is a key factor in profitability. Therefore, this study examines several variables, including Website Design, Website Security, Information Quality, and Perceived Ease of Use, that affect customer satisfaction and its effect on online purchase intention. Sampling totaling 400 respondents, including 168 Tokopedia respondents, 141 Bukalapak respondents, and 92 Shopee respondents and questionnaires were distributed in DKI Jakarta. All questionnaire data were analyzed using Smart PLS 3.0 with the Partial Least Square method. The results showed that perceived ease of use has a significant effect on customer satisfaction, and customer satisfaction has a significant effect on online purchase intention. On the other hand, the results showed that website design, website security, and information quality had no significant effect on customer satisfaction. Thus, the findings of this study are expected to help e-commerce to implement the right strategy to keep competing in e-commerce in Indonesia, especially Jakarta. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

But some of the big problems that are often faced by the restaurant business in implementing SI have become increasingly clear, among which are systems that are running less than optimal due to lack of experience. This paper will examine a restaurant franchise in Indonesia called SS Restaurant. Currently, SS Restaurant is facing complaints against the restaurant information system (RIS) such as the RIS system which is no longer adequate and does not have the latest features and the research and development (R&D) process of the restaurant is not running due to slow data processing and not optimal control outlets. The purpose of this paper is to design and recommend new business processes in restaurant RIS and add new system models such as online ordering, real-time reporting, cloud-based systems and data analysis for restaurants. The model in the Zachman framework that will be used in this research framework becomes a 3x3 matrix, basedon 3 main perspectives required by Restaurant SS management that is: General Scope, Owner Perspective and Designer Perspective. By implementing this new RIS, Restaurant SS is expected to be able to further increase their business’ performance through the benefits of improved operational efficiency and continual development of the implemented information system. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The innovations make life activies easier and efficient. One of technology innovation widely known in Indonesia is GO-JEK. This study is intended for the users of GO-JEK application. GO-JEK was initially an Indonesian-based company engaged in the transportation services using an online-based mobile application. Since it was founded in 2011, GO-JEK has grown rapidly and reached many consumers. This research aims to see how factors such as discounts, promos, transaction speeds, convenience, etc. affect the users in using GO-PAY as a means of payment. The data show that the transaction volume using FinTech payment has risen significantly. Authors want to conduct the study on what factors make people interested in choosing GO-PAY and remain loyal to use it. The research can be used in FinTech development in the future or used in other research as based what factors that have priority above the others. The study was completed by conducting a survey for 3-days, involving 71 GO-JEK application users living in the Greater Jakarta area.

Cloud computing offers several potential benefits that many e- governments over the world are trying to obtain by adopting cloud solutions into their architecture and public services. This paper focuses on designing GEA using TOGAF ADM based on the G-cloud model. The conceptual relationship between cloud computing in government agencies and information architecture is provided to provide a better picture in the implementation of GEA. A mapping model for G-cloud implementation is presented, as well as services provided by the G-Vendor cloud to describe the objectives and potential requirements for conceptualization processes. The proposed framework is expected to increase the success rate of e-government implementation in Indonesia, which has declined significantly over the last 8 years. However, that does not rule out the possibility of being implemented in other countries so that e-government can provide the promised benefits to their citizens. © 2019 IJSTR.","E-government; Enterprise architecture; Government cloud (g-cloud); Government enterprise architecture; Indonesia; TOGAF",,,,,,,"Setiawan, A., Yulianto, E., E-Government Interoperability and Integration Architecture Modeling Using TOGAF Framework Based On Service Oriented Architecture (2018) The Asian Journal of Technology Management, 11 (1), pp. 26-45; Saha, P., (2010) Enterprise architecture as platform for connected government: Understanding the impact of enterprise architecture on connected government, , National University of Singapore Institute of Systems Science; Budiardjo, E.K., Firmansyah, G., Hasibuan, Z.A., Weighted Components of i-Government Enterprise Architecture (2017) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 801 (1), p. 12025; Saiya, A.A., Arman, A.A., Indonesian Enterprise Architecture Framework: A Platform for Integrated and Connected Government (2018) 2018 International Conference on ICT for Smart Society (ICISS), pp. 1-6; (2016) United Nations E-Government Survey 2016: E-Government in Support of Sustainable Development, , United Nations; Firmansyah, G., Hasibuan, Z.A., Sucahyo, Y.G., Indonesia e-Government components: A principal component analysis approach (2014) 2014 International Conference on Information Technology Systems and Innovation (ICITSI), pp. 148-152; (2003) Presidential Directive No. 3/2003 about National Policy and Strategy for e-Government Development, , Indonesian Republic Cabinet Secretariat.

The IS audit control mechanism using this COBIT framework not only provides an evaluation of IT governance in the company, but also provides inputs that can be used to improve its management. COBIT 5 is therefore a benchmark for the process of appraising and improving IT governance. After the mapping obtained 7 processes for the measurement that is EDM02, APO02, APO11, BAI06, DSS01, DSS02, and DSS03. Result of each process, obtained the level of capability of each process EDM02 = Level 1, APO02 = Level 2, APO11 = Level 2, BAI06 = Level 2, DSS01 = Level 2, DSS02 = Level 2, and DSS03 = Level 1.

The emergence of applications for online transportations services such as Gojek / Grab has made some people switch to using conventional transportation to online transportation. But with the development of online transportation, there are still people in Batam City taking action against online transportation. For this reason, researchers conducted research to look for factors that influence the acceptance of the people of Batam City on online transportation. The researcher used the UTAUT2 research model (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2) and the IS Success Model DeLone & McLean. The construct of this research model uses constructs of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, price value, information quality, system quality, service quality, behavioral intention, user satisfaction, use behavior. The number of respondents in this study amounted to 400 respondents using SPSS Amos version 22. The results of the analysis showed that the factors that significantly influenced the acceptance of the people of Batam City on the application of online transportation services were seen from constructs of behavioral intention (user intention) 91.2%, performance expectancy is 51.7%, price value is 42.6%, while construct of user satisfaction is influenced by system quality by 68%, information quality is 28.2%, service quality is 12.6%. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Information System Success Model Five; Transportation application online; UTAUT2",,,,,,,"Agyapong, G., The Effect of Service Quality on Customer Satisfaction in the Utility Industry-A Case of Vodafone (Ghana) (2011) International Journal of Business and Management, 6 (5), pp. 203-210; Brady, M.K., Robertson, C.J., Searching for a consensus on the antecedent role of service quality and satisfaction: An exploratory cross national study (2001) J.

In this risk management information system analysis will focus on 7 domains. The results of this study indicate that the level of risk faced by Bank XYZ is at the highest risk level. so that Bank XYZ must take control to overcome these risks. Information system maturity level at Bank XYZ has an average value of 3.00 which explains that it is still in the defined stage. While the target expected by Bank XYZ is 4.00. The gap of 1.00 must be a concern, because the level of risk arises due to the maturity level of the Bank XYZ system that has not been fulfilled. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS","Enterprise Risk Management; Financial Technology; Information System Risk Management; ISO 31000; Maturity Level",,,,,,,"Bennis, W., Why leaders can’t lead (1989) Train.

However, there has been no standardize framework that support the need while aligning with business strategy. This study focuses on designing architecture framework that can help government agencies in adopting cloud solution based on ROCCA and TOGAF 9.2. Both of them are well known used for cloud adoption initiatives and architecture work, especially for organizations who are actively transforming themselves. We mapped ROCCA and TOGAF 9.2 processes to provide baseline requirements of cloud adoption. Then, validate the proposed framework with implementation and evaluation in case study for The Special Task Force of Upstream Oil and Gas Activities (SKK Migas). The result showed the processes provided are a good guidance and appropriate to support strategic government approach in analyzing and planning cloud solutions effectively. © 2019 The Authors.","Cloud computing; Enterprise architecture; Government; ROCCA; Strategic planning; TOGAF","Air navigation; Cloud computing; Information systems; Information use; Strategic planning; Architecture frameworks; Business strategy; Enterprise Architecture; Government; Government agencies; Oil and gas activities; ROCCA; TOGAF; Computer architecture",,,,,"This research was being conducted and supported by The Special Task Force of Upstream Oil and Gas Activities (SKK Migas) as part of the Digitalization of Office Facilities Management Services Program.","Fuzes, P., How does cloud computing change the strategic alignment between how does cloud computing change the strategic alignment between business and IT ?

Majority of the examination timetabling problems are NP-complete. This paper addresses the so-called graph coloring reduction of examination timetabling problem which is to find a feasible examination timetable with minimum timeslots used. The report contains an investigation on the implementation of a heuristic hybridized with a simulated annealing-based heuristic using three different neighborhood structures. The method is tested on a popular dataset, and compare the results with several other authors. The method is capable of finding the best solutions ever reported as well as improving current best known results. © 2018 IEEE.","combinatorial optimization; heuristics/ metaheuristics simulated annealing; ocmputational intelligence; timetabling/ scheduling","Combinatorial optimization; Information management; Simulated annealing; Examination timetabling; Graph colorings; Meta heuristics; Neighborhood structure; NP Complete; ocmputational intelligence; Time slots; Timetabling; Scheduling",,,,,,"Abdullah, S., Burke, E.K., McCollum, B., An investigating of variable neighborhoodsearch for university course timetabling (2005) Proceeedings of Mista 2005: The 2nd Multidisciplinary Conference on Scheduling: Theory and Applications, New York, pp. 413-427; Abramson, D., Krishnamoorthy, M., Dang, H., Simulated annealing cooling schedules for the school timetabling problem (1999) Asia-Pacific Journal of Operational Research, 16, pp. 1-22; Caramia, M., Dell'Olmo, P., Italiano, G.F., New algorithms for examination timetabling (1982) Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Algorithm Engineering, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2000, pp. 230-242. , Springer-Verlag; Carter, M.W., Laporte, G., Lee, S.Y., Examination timetabling algorithmic strategies and applications (1996) Journal of Operational Research Society, 47, pp. 373-383; Cooper, T.B., Kingston, J.H., (1995) The Complexity of Timetable Construction Problems, , Technical Report Number 495 The University of Sydney; Di Gaspero, L., Schaerf, A., Tabu search techniques for examination timetabling (2001) PATAT 2000, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2079, pp. 104-117. , E.

This phenomenon is happened by the belief that lack of capturing user requirement. This is due to consider the business environment is always running normally. In fact, the development of the system needs a way to anticipate the business environment that unpredictable changes.Therefore, the phenomenon on the need for modeling services can able to respond to the changing needs of users still have a chancein this study. It explores modeling services to synergize SOA and BPM.Several previous studies generally use a business driven approach, technical partially driven to develop the service modeling. This leads to the question of how a service should be modeled so that it can be applied in different contexts and business processes also. It is support user needs in diversity and heterogeneous system environments. This Conditions occurs in corporate university. The case studies in this research is a Learning Management System (LMS) in Academic Enterprise System (EAS). The research stages are: (1) Analysis of Synergy in SOA and BPM, (2) Analysis of User Experience in LMS Academic Enterprise System (L-EAS), (3) Analysis of Modeling Framework, (4) Proposed Framework that aligning SOA and BPM. The result of this study is proposed system framework based on services to increase the flexibility of information systems at LMS Academic Enterprise System (L-EAS).

SCRUM is one of example agile contain iteration called sprint which describes phasing running on the timeline of the project and by sprint planning the SCRUM master (as a leader) can direct the team to finish on a date. The motivation for SCRUM team member will influence the result, so in this research, we try to design a gamified method into SCRUM. We make a prototype design about gamification in SCRUM development and also spread a questionnaire to the respondent already have experience with SCRUM development.

Therefore, the perpose of the research it will conduct an audit of risk management information system at private Bank to determine the level of maturity level that has been applied whether it is in accordance with Methodology using ISO/IEC 27001 standard. The process to be used in this risk management information system audit focuses on annex 7. Asset Management, annex 10. Communication and operation and annex 11. Access control. The result of the stages that will be done is from seeing the current condition to the conclusion that results from the maturity level the relevant bank. From the results obtained, the maturity level of asset 7 asset management 3.2, annex 10 communications and operation 3.9 and aneex 11 access controls is 3.7. To increase the value of the maturity level of the bank, a process that must be carried out includes: There are several procedures and compliance that have not been executed by Bank in the overall control of the management asset. the conclution of the research obtained is 3.2 for the maturity level scale of 5 which means there is a gap of 1.8 for the value of compliance to achieve target 5. But, to achieve target 4, Bank has gap analysis 0.8 to get level 4 in maturity Level. To get these levels, things that must be run can be seen in the sub suggestion on the next page. In annex 10 that discuss the Communication and Operations Management, the Bank already done well and in accordance with the existing SOP at the bank. From a scale of 5, the bank has applied maturity level with point 3.9 which can be interpreted that the gap in the annex is 1.1 to get level 5 on the maturity level. To get level 4, Bank must do a little development because the diffrence value from maturity level from 3.9 to level 4 is 0,1. So, it can be ascertained with the compliance and the existing documents in Bank can be run entirely to get the appropriate results for the future. In annex 11 that discusses the Access Control on Bank, it is very good and in accordance with SOP and the standards applicable to Bank. The bank. From the implementation of Bank get maturity value 3,7. To get maturity level 4, then the gap is 0.3. For the future can be maturity level 4 if the process and procedures on sub suggestions can be run properly and correctly. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Asset management; Audit IS; Bank; ISO 27001; Risk management",,,,,,,"(2006) Perencanaan Tata Kelola Keamanan Informasi, , Jakarta: Fasilkom UI; (2014), A model for information security compliant Behaviour in the healthcare cotect.

The reviewed agricultural commodities were avocado, chili, cacao, orange, litchi, coffee, pepper, mangos teen, and palm tree. The project results indicated a land suitability map which generated a range of data required by the agricultural businesses, such as variable name of villages, sub districts, districts, provinces levels ,and potential areas, presented through WebGIS which was built by using MapServer and MySql. WebGIS interface was made as easy as possible so users might adapt and get information easily. The recommended areas for each crop were reviewed based on climatic factors, topography, soil type, and land cover. Recommendation related to an appropriate area for the development of a commodity depends on a class of land suitability and available field areas. Information on the field suitability will be publicized through the WebGIS so the agribusinesses can determine what commodities, field area, and which region they have to develop.(H). © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Land suitability; Maps development; Webgis",,,,,,,"Alesheikh, A.A., Helali Dan, H., Behroz, H.A., Web gis: Technologies and its applications (2002) Dept. of Geodesy and Geomatics Engineering.

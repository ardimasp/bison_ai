The addition of Diamond Encoding is to make difference of pixel pair dynamic so the difference in image’s pixel can’t be seen with naked eye. To make easier for user to choose and share image file, this application will be developed on Android smartphone. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

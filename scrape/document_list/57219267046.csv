The reasoning behind this would be mobile applications are becoming a saturated market and messenger applications are surpassing social networking applications regarding to the number of active users. Binus Maya is becoming less attractive since it is not engineered for mobile devices, which creates inconvenience for students to access campus information. The research creates a chatbot as an alternative solution to Binus International's existing information systems. The application created is accessible from both desktop and mobile, created with Node. JS with the natural language processor being used is called API. AI. Taking accounts from the user acceptance testing, 80% of testers agreed that the created chatbot can be a good and faster alternative information retrieval compared to Binus Maya. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Chatbot; Information System; Mobile Application; Web Application","Commerce; Information systems; Information use; Mobile computing; Online systems; Alternative information; Chatbot; Mobile applications; Number of active users; Online information systems; Social networking applications; User acceptance testing; WEB application; Acceptance tests",,,,,"Martin, E., (2016) 3 Reasons 2017 Is the Year to Develop A Company Chatbot, , https://thenextweb.com/opinion/2016/12/09/3-reasons-2017-year-develop-company-chatbot/#.tnw_072Wqknl, Online; Wallace, M.J., Eliza, Computer Therapist, , http://www.manifestation.com/neurotoys/eliza.php3, Online; Ritchie, R., (2015) Siri 'Crushing' Competitors at Language Accuracy, , https://www.imore.com/siri-crushing-competitors-language-accuracy, Online; Press, C.U., (2009) Tokenization, , https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tokenization-1.html, Online; Gilleland, M., (2016) Levenshtein Distance, in Three Flavors, , http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kirk/cs1501/Pruhs/Spring2006/assignments/editdistance/Levenshtein%20Distance.htm, Online; (2017) Most Popular Mobile Messaging Apps Worldwide As of January 2017, Based on Number of Monthly Active Users (In Millions), , https://www.statista.com/statistics/258749/most-popular-global-mobile-messenger-apps/, Statista Online; Schlicht, M., (2016) How Bots Will Completely Kill Websites and Mobile Apps Chatbots Magazine, , https://chatbotsmagazine.com/how-bots-will-completely-kill-websites-and-mobile-apps-656db8e6fc03#.a9fwz51kk, Online; Satzinger, J., Jackson, R., Burd, S., (2012) System Analysis and Design in A Changing World; Walsh, W., (2010) Websocket and Socket.io, , https://davidwalsh.name/websocket, Online; Introducing Gitflow, , https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html, Online; 2017 Entities, , https://docs.api.ai/docs/concept-entities, Online","Bahana, R.; Computer Science Department, Indonesia; email: rbahana@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

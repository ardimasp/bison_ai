Furthermore, there are also notions of primal submodules. Suppose N be a submodule of R-module M. An element r of R is called prime to N if rm ∈ N with m element of M implies m ∈ N. The submodule N is called primal if the set of elements which not prime to N forms an ideal. The generalization of elements which prime to N is proposed and referred as elements that almost prime to N. An element r ∈ R is called almost prime to N if rm ∈ N - (N: M)N for m element of M implies m is an element of N. In this article, we introduce the generalization of elements which are prime to N as elements which are I-prime to N by changing the set (N:M) into an arbitrary ideal of R. With this notion, we can generalize primality of submodule N to I-primality of submodule N. We called N the submodule of M is I-primal submodule if the set of elements which are I-prime to N forms an ideal of R. Furthermore, we give some characterizations of I-primal submodules and their relation to other prime and primal notions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Commutative ring; Primality; Submodules; Physics",,,,,"Akray, I., Ideals, I., (2016) Journal of Algebra and Related Topics, 4, pp. 41-47; Ali, M.M., Multiplication Modules and Homogeneous Idealization II (2007) Beitrage Zur Algera und Geometrie, 48, pp. 321-343; Ameri, R., On the Prime Submodules of Multiplication Modules (2003) IJMMS, 32, pp. 1715-1724; Atani, S.E., Darani, A.Y., Some Remarks on Primal Submodules (2008) Saravejo Journal of Mathematics, 4, pp. 181-190; Atani, S.E., Darani, A.Y., Weakly Primal Submodules (2009) Tamkang Journal of Mathematics, 40 (3), pp. 239-245; Darani, A.Y., Almost Primal Ideals in Commutative Ring (2011) Chiang Mai J.

Suppose R is a commutative ring with identity and M is an //-module. A proper submodule N of M is called prime if rm is element of N implies r element of (Ar : M) or m element of N. In this article we give a generalized version of prime submodule in its localization which named as 5(A')-ahnost prime submodule. This generalization was obtained by creating generalized version of almost prime submodule such that the submodule is not almost prime but its localization is almost prime. Furthermore, some characterizations of S(AT)-almost prime submodules and its relation to 5(/)-almost prime ideals are given in this article. © 2019 Jangjeon Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences and Physics.

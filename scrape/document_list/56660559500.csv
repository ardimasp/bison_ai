With enormous economic and political transformations in Myanmar, corporate governance is really important to increase Myanmar's economic potential and foreign direct investment. With the hope and expectation of growing economic potential following the current transformation in Myanmar, the need of good corporate governance is inevitable. Similar to other Southeast Asian countries, the most severe problems in Myanmar arise between controlling and non-controlling shareholders instead of problems which arise from the separation of ownership and management. This type of problems is referred as type II agency problems. This paper, to my best knowledge, may be among the first paper which discusses corporate governance in Myanmar. Thus, it should encourage greater debates and discussions on Myanmar's corporate governance. Applying institutional theory and agency theory, this paper provides recommendations to combat type II agency problems and promote good corporate governance.

Going-concern-modified audit reports are seen as a credible signal from auditors regarding the financial condition of the company. This research analyses determinants of going-concern-modified audit reports in Indonesia and Singapore. Despite the difference of these two countries, our findings show similar evidence in both countries. Even though prior studies document that companies' characteristics, companies' financial performance and auditors' characteristics may determine the issuance of going-concern-modified audit reports, it is not evident in our study. Despite these variables, we found that the previous year audit report is a significant determinant of issuance of a going-concern- modified audit report. This suggests that this report is a credible signal of a company's financial distress.

To overcome this issue, President Joko Widodo provides his direction and commitment to the development of human capital in Indonesia (World Economic Forum, 2015). This research examines whether Indonesian listed companies in the financial industry follows President’s direction to focus on human capital. The financial industry is used as a research sample due to its exemplary disclosure practices in Indonesia. Furthermore, this research employs the Indonesian intellectual capital disclosures framework developed by Mulyadi et al. (2017) to analyse IC disclosures in the industry. This framework consists of the working environment, intangible assets, and customer relations. Working environment largely consists of human capital, and this research reveals that working environment was the most disclosed IC category in Indonesian financial industry in 2015.

Even though corporate governance practices have been improved, this research reveals that disclosure practices are still poor in Indonesia, particularly those practiced by family corporations. Using 21 disclosure items from United Nations Conference on Trade and Development's corporate governance disclosure benchmark that are mandatory in Indonesia, I found that there are only three corporations which provide all of these required disclosures in their annual reports and none on the webs. These poor disclosure practices may be contributed by the nature of type II agency problems, or the late adoption of recent disclosure regulations in Indonesia. Furthermore, corporate webs in Indonesia do not substitute annual reports for corporate governance disclosures. It only complements annual reports, mainly for shareholders-related information.

In response to the recent concern on the timeliness issue of annual reports, this research provides empirical evidence on IC disclosures among top Australian companies, using their Facebook pages. The similar focus of previous IC disclosures in the annual reports and the previous core focus of social media indicates that social media is viable alternative media for companies to disclose IC. Furthermore, Facebook has been the most popular social media among Australians and Australian businesses. This research is important in that it addresses IC disclosures from the social media perspective, an area of research in non-marketing disclosure study in social media which is under investigated. This research documents that Facebook has been used by ASX 200 high IC companies to disclose their IC information. Similar to previous research on IC disclosures research in annual reports, this research reveals that external capital is the most disclosed category on companies' Facebook pages and customers are the most disclosed IC sub-category. Further, this research also documents a two-way communication process on the companies' Facebook pages and shows that the companies have responded and communicated well with their stakeholders.

Considering its importance, many researches have focused on how corporations report its intellectual capital information. This research analyses intellectual capital reporting of Indonesian corporations. Indonesia is chosen as our research object as it is a developing country with the economy focused on low reliance on intellectual capital. To control this context of low reliance on intellectual capital economy, we chose two industries that are known to have a high reliance on intellectual capital. This research provides an answer as to whether corporations in a low intellectual capital country report their intellectual capital information. Our research documents that Indonesian corporations in the finance and pharmaceutical industry are aware of the importance of intellectual capital, and variations of this disclosure exist within industry.

Despite the importance of intellectual capital, several researchers emphasise the limitation of such studies in non-developed countries. Furthermore, the majority of prior studies on intellectual capital disclosures employ content analysis despite its weaknesses. Therefore, this research constructed an Indonesian intellectual capital disclosure framework, a framework based on data of Indonesia that may overcome content analysis weaknesses. Furthermore, this research also offers a new joint theoretical framework, intellectual capital theoretical framework, which may be useful for future intellectual capital disclosure research. This research contributes to limited intellectual capital disclosure research in Indonesia and provides valuable insights into the practice in Indonesia. This research also contributes to the development and introduction of intellectual capital theoretical framework and Indonesian intellectual capital disclosure framework.

In order to support the development of this industry, it is a common practice that government provide tax incentives. While major prior research in tax incentives focus on the impact of tax incentives on economic development, this research focuses on the impact on corporate performance. This research studies digital TV tax incentives in Canada, Indonesia, and the United States of America (USA). Using EGARCH econometric model on the largest digital TV corporations in these three countries, this research finds that tax incentives are beneficial to support corporate performance with some exception.

As for Asia, especially South East Asia, the trigger was the 1997 economic crisis. The crisis showed the importance of good corporate governance implementation. It is understandable that every country has different policies and regulations; therefore, will lead to different implementation of good corporate governance. In this chapter, we will focus on the implementation of good corporate governance in selected South-East Asia banking industry (Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore selected listed-banking firms). We will analyse the implementation in three countries based on corporate governance rules and practices, enforcement, political and regulatory environment, IGAAP (accounting and auditing) and corporate governance culture. From five factors, we found that Singapore is the best country in the implementation of good corporate governance in its banking industry followed by Malaysia and Indonesia. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

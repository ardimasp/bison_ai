This paper develops Bayesian forecasting method of counts whose conditional distributions given past observations and explanatory variables follow a Poisson distribution. To determine a forecasted value of an observation-driven integer valued autoregressive model, a series of well thought alghoritm needs to be developed, resulting in the use of Bayesian framework. This effective alghoritm sets is then used for the aforementioned calculation for the modelling of time series count data. To get the demanded results, a particle MCMC algorithm for the autoregressive Poisson regression model is introduced in the equation. Two real-life data sets, monthly demand for medicines type X and type Y (2016-2018) are successfully be analysed. We also illustrate that the Bayesian forecasting is more accurate than the corresponding frequentist's approach. © 2019 The Authors.

Forecasting rice price is an action to help government in monitor and control it. Price monitoring is conducted to achieve the good development of domestic trade. In this case, price monitoring is done to maintain the price stability so that it will not harm producers and consumers.

East Java is the most severely affected province contributing approximately 80% of the total cases in the country. This study aims to apply the Zero -inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression to the diphtheria data of East Java Province 2016, in order to determine the factors that most affect the number of cases of diphtheria. The analysis showed that the diphtheria immunization coverage and the number of community health centers are the factors that most affect the number of cases of diphtheria. The model states that every 1 percent increase in diphtheria immunization coverage can decrease the number of cases of diphtheria by 0.624% and every 1 unit increase in the number of community health center will be able decrease the number of cases of diphtheria by 0.107%. © 2018 The Authors.

This study aimed to investigate in vivo anti-diabetic activities of the ethanol extract, ethyl acetate fraction and n-hexane fraction of Cassia siamea Lamk in alloxan-induced mice. The study concluded that: (1) the ethanol extract and n-hexane fraction of Cassia siamea Lamk (Juar) leaves have anti-diabetic activity in Webster albino mice induced with alloxan, (2) The extract of Cassia siamea Lamk leaves, the fractions of 500 mg ethyl acetate and 500 mg n-Hexana of Cassia siamea Lamk provided better performances in lowering blood glucose levels compared to Ethanol extracts both 500 mg and 1000 mg. In the form of ethyl acetate and n-hexane fraction at a dose of 150 mg/kg BW provided the highest anti-diabetic activity compared to the other test groups that are able to decrease blood sugar level by 10.25% and 9.98% respectively. Its effect is equivalent to glibenclamide at a dose of 0.65 mg/kg BW which can lower blood sugar levels by 9.27%. Thus Cassia siamea Lamk leaf is very potential as an alternative drug antidiabetes mellitus, and (3) the 1000 mg Ethanol extract, 150 mg Ethyl acetate and 150 mg n-Hexana had no difference effects in lowering blood glucose levels compared to the anti-diabetic chemical drug glibenclamide. © 2018 The Authors.

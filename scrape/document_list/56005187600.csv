This research was taken in Jakarta, Indonesia. Laws used in this research are Law Number 18 of 1999 about Construction Services and Law Number 2 of 2017 about Construction Services. With the shift of Construction Services Law, of course there are several differences, changes, revision, and inclusion and exclusion of past laws. This changes and differences were analysed to improve the current running Construction Services Law for the future. This research uses two methods, which are literature study and study using questionnaire through observations and interviews. Variables and questions for the questionnaire were formed from study of literature, past researches and Construction Services Laws discussed in this paper. Results from the questionnaire was analysed using a computer program, IBM SPSS Statistics 23. Using that program, the data from the results were tested for its validity and reliability. And it was analysed using correlation analysis and factor analysis. From the analysis it was concluded that there are two factors that needs to be improved, the two factors are: regulation about building failure is not explained well enough, and the lack of regulation about Expert Assessor. Through these results, the construction services law can be improved and prevent environmental health damage caused by building failure that was caused by problems in construction services. These environmental health damage caused by building failure have negative impact to environmental health and safety of the surrounding area, whether from emission or toxic pollutants. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","building failure; construction services law; environmental impact; factor analysis; Indonesia; questionnaire","Buildings; Disasters; Environmental impact; Environmental regulations; Factor analysis; Failure (mechanical); Health; Laws and legislation; Multivariant analysis; Software testing; Surveys; Building failure; Civil engineering projects; Construction services; Environmental health; Environmental health and safety; Inclusion and exclusions; Indonesia; questionnaire; Construction",,,,,"Liyanto, S., (2017) Analisis Potensi Masalah Yang Menghambat Penerapan Keberlanjutan Konstruksi Pada Aspek Kesehatan Dan Keselamatan Kerja (UUJK No. 2 Tahun 2017); Ariadi, R., (2017) Sandingan Analisis Kegagalan Bangunan (UUJK No. 18 Tahun 1999 Dan UUJK No. 2 Tahun 2017); Kristanto, A., (2016) Analisis Faktor Penyimpangan Pada Kontrak Konstruksi Oleh Pengguna Jasa; Putra, A.B., Hendrik, S., (2018) Analisis Ketetapan Undang Undang No. 18 Tahun 1999 Tentang Jasa Konstruksi Dengan Undang Undang No. 2 Tahun 2017 Tentang Jasa Konstruksi Terhadap Pengguna Dan Penyedia Jasa Konstruksi.; Creswell, J.W., (2014) Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative and Mixed Methods Approaches; Yin, R.K., (2009) Case Study Research Design and Methods Fourth Edirion; Gay, L.R., Diehl, P.L., (1992) Research Methods for Business and Management; Risnita, Pengembangan Skala Likert (2012) Jurnal Edu-Bio, 3; Ramsey, P.H., Critical Values for Spearman's Rank Order Correlation (1989) Journal of Education Statistics, 14; Lee Peter, M., (2005) Upper Critical Values for Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient Rs.; Putra, Z.F.S., Sholeh, M., Widyastuti, N., Analisis Kualitas Website BTKP - DIY Menggunakan Metode WebQual 4.0 (2014) Jurnal JARKOM, 1; Mahlangu, B.P., Kruger, L.P., The Impact of the Maintenance System: A Case Study of the Petrosa GTL Refinery (2015) South African Journal of Industrial Engineering, 26; Nugroho, S.B., Nugroho, D., Kustanto, Korelasi Antara Prestasi Akademik Dengan Tingkat Kemampuan TIK Pada Sekolah Dasar Negeri 3 Malangjiwan (2014) Jurnal TIKomSiN, 2; Wiyana, Y.E., Analisis Kegagalan Konstruksi dan Bangunan Dari Perspektif Faktor Teknis (2012) Wahana Teknik Sipil, 17, pp. 77-86; Janssens, V., O'Dwyer, D.W., Chryssanthopoulos, M.K., Building Failure Consequences Robustness of Structures Proceedings of the Final Conference of COST Action TU0601; Hardjomuljadi, S., Peran Penilai Ahli Dalam Penanganan Kegagalan Bangunan dan Kegagalan Konstruksi (Menurut UU No 18 Tahun 1999 JO PP 29 Tahun 2000) (2014) Jurnal Konstruksia, 6; Arumsari, P., Suhendra, A., Indira, H., Risk factos affecting the quality of high rise office building projects in DKI Jakarta province (2018) The 2nd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development 2018 (ICEED 2018)","Putra, A.B.; Civil Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: andibayuputra@gmail.com",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

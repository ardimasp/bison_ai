Along with this development, the use of information technology, which is the basis of the information system, should be considered as a very useful tool to survive in the competition in the hospitality industry. Previous studies have widely discussed the role of information systems at the strategic level. Including the assertion of Nicholas Carr that is 'IT Doesn't Matter'. This assertion need to be tested by the extent to which the maturity of the use of information systems through its elements could affect the company's strategic performance measured from the five perspective of Kaplan's Business Balanced Scorecard in the hospitality sector in Indonesia. The study was conducted by distributing questionnaires to managers of 3 stars hotels in Jakarta. Data obtained was further analyzed using multiple regression analysis. This study verifies that the maturity of information systems in general have a significant relationship with organizational performance both financial and non-financial. The contribution shows from 30 % to 60 %, contrary to the Carr's assertion of no strategic contribution of IT on the companies. © 2016 IEEE.","Competitiveness; Hospitality Industry; IS/IT strategy","Information systems; Regression analysis; Surveys; Balanced scorecards; Competitiveness; Hospitality industry; Indonesia; Multiple regression analysis; Organizational performance; Role of Information Systems; Strategic level; Competition",,,,,"Statistik, B.P., JumlahAkomodasi, Rata-rata PekerjadanJumlahTamu per Hari MenurutProvinsi, 2009-2014 (Hotel Bintang), , http://www.bps.go.id/linkTabelStatis/view/id/1373, Retrieved February 2, 2015 from BadanPusatStatistik; DiPietro, R.B., Wang, Y.R., Key issues for ICT applications: Impacts and implications for hospitality operations (2010) Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism, 2 (1), pp. 49-67; Buhalis, D., Law, R., Progress in information technology and tourism management: 20 years on and 10 years after the Internet-The state of etourism research (2008) Tourism Management, 29 (4), pp. 609-623; Quan, J., Hu, Q., Wang, X., IT is not for everyone in China (2005) Communications of the ACM, 48 (4), pp. 69-72; Carr, N.G., IT doesn't matter (2003) Harvard Business Review, 81 (5), pp. 41-49; Tian, J., Wang, K., Chen, Y., Johansson, B., From IT deployment capabilities to competitive advantage: An exploratory study in China (2009) Information System Frontiers, 12, pp. 239-255; Majeed, S., Impact of competitive advantage on organizational performance (2011) European Journal of Business and Management, 3 (4), pp. 191-197; Croteau, A.-M., Bergeron, F., An information trilogy: Business strategy, technological deployment, and organizational performance (2001) Journal of Strategic Information System, 10, pp. 77-99; François, B., Louis, R., Suzanne, R., Ideal patterns of strategic alignment and business performance (2004) Information and Management, 41 (8), pp. 1003-1020; Tallon, P.P., Pinsonneault, A., Competing perspectives on the link between strategic information technology alignment and organizational agility: Insights from a mediation model (2011) MIS Quarterly, 35 (2), pp. 463-484; Tapia, R.S., Daneva, M., Eck, P.V., Validating adequacy and suitability of business-it alignment criteria in an inter-enterprise maturity model 202 (2007) Proceedings of the 11th IEEE International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference, EDOC.

The grand purpose of our research is to deliver important medical aids for patients in emergency situations and implementation in agriculture in Indonesia, as part of the big mission of Society 5.0 and related with big data. In sending process, drone must be able to detect object and reach goal position and go back safely using GPS. We proposed a navigation algorithm for drone including the usage of course-over-ground information to help drone in doing autonomous navigation. In the experiment that we did, the average of positional deviation of landing position between the actual landing position and the desired landing position in the flight tests of flying from start to goal is 1.1125 m and for the tests that use the algorithm which uses course-over-ground, the positional deviation has average of 2.39 m. Navigation using course-over-Ground algorithm is not more reliable than the navigation algorithm with GNSS and Compass at a navigation distance of less than 1 m. © 2019, The Author(s).","Big data; Drone; GNSS; Navigation systems",,,,,,"Jha, A.R., (2016) Theory, design, and applications of unmanned aerial vehicles, , CRC Press, New York; Hickey, M., (2013) Meet Amazon Prime Air, a Delivery-By-Aerial-Drone Project; Apvrille, L., Tanzi, T., Dugelay, J.L., Autonomous drones for assisting rescue services within the context of natural disasters (2014) General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS), 2014 Xxxith URSI, pp. 1-4; Entrop, A.G., Vasenev, A., Infrared drones in the construction industry: designing a protocol for building thermography procedures (2017) Energy Procedia, 132, pp. 63-68; Casella, E., Mapping coral reefs using consumer-grade drones and structure from motion photogrammetry techniques (2017) Coral Reefs, 36 (1), pp. 269-275; Motlagh, N.H., Bagaa, M., Taleb, T., UAV-based IoT platform: a crowd surveillance use case (2017) IEEE Commun Mag, 55 (2), pp. 128-134; Mekki, K., Bajic, E., Chaxel, F., Meyer, F., A comparative study of LPWAN technologies for large-scale IoT deployment (2018) ICT Express; Claesson, A., Time to delivery of an automated external defibrillator using a drone for simulated out-of-hospital cardiac arrests vs emergency medical services (2017) JAMA, 317 (22), pp. 2332-2334; Scott, J., Scott, C., Drone delivery models for healthcare (2017) Proc. 50Th Hawaii Int.

The grand purpose of our research is to deliver important medical aids for patients in emergency situations. The case can be simplified into delivery of an item from start to the goal position. We will exploit the drone technology for transporting items efficiently. In sending process, our drone must detect the object target, where the items will be delivered. Therefore, we need object detection module that can detect what is in video stream and where the object is by using GPS as well. To implement the module, we use combination of MobileNet and the Single Shot Detector (SSD) framework for fast and efficient deep learning-based method to object detection. The ability of deep learning to detect and localize specific objects is studied by conducting experiments using drone camera and, as comparison, using stereo camera Minoru. © 2018 IEEE.","deep learning; delivery problem; drone; MobileNet; object detection; SSD","Aircraft detection; Cameras; Drones; Object detection; Object recognition; Stereo image processing; Target drones; Delivery problems; Emergency situation; Learning-based methods; MobileNet; Quadcopter; Single shots; Stereo cameras; Deep learning",,,,,"Bengio, Y., Courville, A., Vincent, P., Representation learning: A review and new perspectives (2013) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 35 (8), pp. 1798-1828; Budiharto, W., Robust vision-based detection and grasping object for manipulator using sift keypoint detector (2014) International Conference on Advanced Mechatronic Systems (ICAMechS 2014), pp. 448-452. , Japan; Yeremia, H., Yuwono, N.A., Raymond, P., Budiharto, W., Genetic algorithm and neural network for optical character recognition (2013) Journal of Computer Science, pp. 1435-1442; Deep Learning, , https://towardsdatascience.com/deeplearning-2-f81ebe632d5c; Parrot AR Drone, , https://www.parrot.com/global/drones; Bengio, Y., Learning deep architectures for ai (pdf) (2009) Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning, 2 (1), pp. 1-127; Zhou, B., Lapedriza, A., Xiao, J., Torralba, A., Oliva, A., Learning deep features for scene recognition using places database (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 487-495; Socher, R., Huval, B., Bath, B., Manning, C.D., Ng, A.Y., Convolutional-recursive deep learning for 3d object classification (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 656-664; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1097-1105; Qi, C.R., Su, H., Mo, K., Guibas, L.J., Pointnet: Deep learning on point sets for 3d classification and segmentation (2017) Proc.

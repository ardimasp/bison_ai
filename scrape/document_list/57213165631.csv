Those who offer help will give you a service value for each item offered for them to buy. This phenomenon is a new business model that has the potential to be developed. Based on this phenomenon, it is necessary to design an application that can accommodate the phenomenon of Jastip. This application will design as a mobile application using Spark based Big Data technology. StealDeal is an online service application through a mobile application that provides discount product recommendations on websites that exist in Japan. In this application object design service only issues a test object design using a large data processing method in the system architecture design. Focus point of this design is the architectural design. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

However, the temporary projects and the turnover of the project team members remained obstructions in performing these principles. Leadership is a competency that must be possessed by the contractor project manager in leading the project and making sure the construction project sustainability constructing subordinate engagement and organizational learning. Various studies on leadership styles that are suitable to be applied in the construction industry have been carried out in various countries, but in Indonesia, it has not been a concern. This study describes the leadership styles of the project manager uses Path-Goal leadership theory. From the research carried out on projects in Jakarta and Bandung, it was found that project managers in construction projects tend to lead by using achievement oriented style. Short construction project completion times and penalties if the project finish late, both are making PM oriented towards achievement, giving targets to the project team and expecting the best performance from the project team. However, project managers lack trust in subordinates to take decisions (participative). It affected the subordinate engagement at work that needed in supporting construction sustainability. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","construction sustainability; leadership; path goal theory; project manager","Construction industry; Contractors; Managers; Sustainable development; Construction projects; leadership; Leadership style; Leadership theory; Organizational learning; path goal theory; Project managers; Project team; Project management",,,,,"Bhattacharya, Sen, S., Korschun, D., (2011) Leveraging Corporate Responsibility: The Stakeholder Route to Maximizing Business and Social Value; Brundtland, G.H., (1987) Our Common Future: Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development; Cheung, S.O., Lam, K.C., Ng, T., Yue, W.M., A satisfy leadership behavior model for design consultants (2001) International Journal of Project Management, 19 (7), pp. 421-429; (2009) Lean Construction for Sustainable Business Joint CIEF and CPN Seminar Held at the Centre for Construction Innovation, , Construction Industry Enviromental Forum (CIEF); Englund, R., Bucero, A., How to develop your personal skills for p/roject success (2013) PM World Journal, 2, pp. 1-17; Famakin, Abisuga, Effect of path-goal leadership styles on the commitment of employees on construction projects (2016) International Jornal of Construction Management, 16 (1), pp. 67-76; Hong, Y., Liyin, S., Yongtao, T., Jianli, H., Simulating the impacts of policy scenarios on the sustainability performance of infrastructure projects (2011) Automation in Construction, 20 (8), pp. 1060-1069; House, R.J., Path-goal theory of leadership: Lessons, legacy, and a reformulatedtheory (1996) Leadership Quarterly, 7 (3), pp. 323-352; House, R.J., Mitchell, T.R., Path-Goal Theory of Leadership (1974) Contemporary Business, 3, pp. 81-98; Jordan, A., (2009) Project Manager Vs.

The complex characteristics of highrise building work present challenges for contractors to be able to complete projects on time. Many factors cause delays in highrise building projects and these factors differ from every country. A survey used questionnaires that have conducted in Jakarta, Indonesia obtained ten dominant factors which were then grouped into two main variables: (1) changes in the scope of work and (2) weak planning and controlling. Changes in the scope of work have a direct impact on changes in project costs. The development of the contractor team's ability to coordinate and communicate with other parties involved in construction, likewise the development of the contractor team's ability to plan is expected to overcome project delays in highrise building projects. Improving the capability of the contractor team project is needed to support sustainable competitiveness in the construction sector. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","analysis factor; contractor; highrise building; project delay","Buildings; Construction industry; Contractors; Surveys; analysis factor; Complex characteristics; Construction sectors; Dominant factor; High rise building; High-rise building constructions; Planning and controlling; Project delays; Construction",,,,,"Ahuja, H.N., Dozzi, S.P.S., Abourizk, M., (1994) Project Management: Techniques in Planning and Controlling Construction Projects; Alexander, H., (2016) 189 Gedung Bertingkat Sesaki Jakarta Hingga 2019 Mendatang, , https://properti.kompas.com/read/2016/10/13/191157021/189.gedung.bertingkat.sesaki.jakarta.hingga.2019.mendatang?page=all; Alifen, R., Setiawan, R., Sunarto, A., Analisa what if sebagai metode antisipasi keterlambatan durasi proyek (1999) Jurnal Teknik Sipil Dan Perencanaan Universitas Kristen Petra.; Ariefasa, R., (2011) Factor Penyebab Keterlambatan Pekerjaan Konstruksi Bangunan Gedung Bertingkat Yang Berpengaruh Terhadap Perubahan Anggaran Biaya Pada Pekerjaan Struktur; Asa, E.B., Arun, B.T., Edmund, Construction delays in high-rise building projects in usa and india (2019) International Journal of Information Research and Review, 6, pp. 6164-6173; Astina, D., Widhiawati, I.A.R., Igp, J., Analysis of the factors causing delay execution of project construction in tabanan district (2012) Jurnal Ilmiah Elektronik Infrastruktur Teknik Sipil; Bhatti, I.A., Nagapan, S.A., Abd, H., Sohu, S., Delay in high rise building construction project of Dubai: A Review (2018) Engineering Science and Technology International Research Journal, 2; (2012) Karakteristik Gedung High Rise Building, , http://manajemenproyekindonesia.com/?p=1440, Budisuanda; Haslinda, A.N., Xian, T.W., Norfarahayu, K., Hanafi, R.M., Fikri, H.M., Investigation on the factors influencing construction time and cost overrun for high-rise building projects in penang Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 995; Haslinda, A.N., Xian, T.W., Norfarahayu, K., Hanafi, R.M., Fikri, H.M., Investigation on the Factors Influencing Construction Time and Cost Overrun for High-Rise Building Projects in Penang (2018) IOP Conf.

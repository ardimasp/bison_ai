This paper uses naive Bayes for classifying the result of eigenface feature extraction to predict the face. The normalization z-score is added for sharping the accuracy. To see the performance of proposed method, the 200 datasets are divided into data training and testing by using cross validation (k=10). The results show that the proposed method can predict the face image up to 70%. Moreover by adding normalization Z-Score, the accuration of prediction raise up to 89.5% (in average). © 2016 IEEE.","Eigenface; Face Recognition; Naive Bayes; z-score","Classifiers; Forecasting; Cross validation; Eigenfaces; Face images; Naive bayes; Training and testing; Z-scores; Face recognition",,,,,"Jain, A.K., Ross, A., Prabhakar, S., An introduction to biometric recognition (2004) IEEE Trans.

Various office equipment and even city pages have been integrated with the internet. In addition to technological developments also occur in the mirror, smart mirror technology is one of the new things, especially in the field of learning, still in traditional technology where mirrors are only used for mirroring. The use of mirrors in education is not yet desirable, so there is a need for innovation in that field. Some studies have involved microcontrollers such as raspberry pi that have been applied to mirrors, where innovation through mirrors is becoming more and more. So that the innovations carried out on the Smart Mirror using mirrors of homes, offices and pages that have a scheduling automation system, turn on video, music, face recognition and control using Android. Students and lecturers need this technology to increase student involvement. The Smart Mirror in this study gave students and lecturers a variety of intelligent experiences. Students and Lecturers can innovate in teaching and learning activities by making changes to their control (Android). In this research has succeeded in creating a new smart mirror innovation with facial recognition needed for students and lecturers to be used for daily teaching and learning activities, especially in the university area in Bandung. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

A screen that has reflective properties such as a mirror makes students and students more curious when the learning process occurs. Based on the development of a microcontroller, unidirectional mirror, frame, and other hardware devices, a smart mirror, as a mirror display screen, offers a safer, more convenient, faster, more precise, and smarter type, information-based to support quality education. So hopefully, this tool will help students be more creative, innovative, and more interested in all subjects [14]–[16].","This work is supported by Research and Technology Transfer Office, Bina Nusantara University as a part of Penelitian Terapan Binus entitled << Utilising Smart Mirror Technology on Internet of Things to Improve Interactive Learning>> with contract number: No.025/VR.RTT/IV/2020 and contract date: 6 April 2020.","Ziegler, S., Nikoletsea, S., Krco, S., Rolim, J., Fernandes, J., Internet of Things and crowd sourcing-A paradigm change for the research on the Internet of Things (2015) IEEE World Forum Internet Things, WF-IoT 2015-Proc, pp. 395-399; Hamza, M., Lohar, S.

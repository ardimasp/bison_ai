However, technology and human resources in Indonesia and creative economy development are still constrained by the limited quantity and quality of business-owner skills in the creative sector and also operations and business management. This impacts the development of the creative industry which is currently sluggish. The aim of this research is to analyze the problems in building knowledge management technology based on a mobile app for SMEs. Such applications are aimed at being able to capture, regulate, store, and spread knowledge with practitioners and disseminate existing SMEs knowledge. The SEM method is applied in inferential analysis to process data obtained through surveys and questionnaires with a total of 204 samples conducted in the city of JABODETABEK. Research and development and software development methodologies were used to develop a knowledge management system for SMEs. Based on the results of an investigation of benefits (perceive usefulness), obtained from the use of knowledge management technology in terms of uploading knowledge in the form of videos, discussion forums, and articles on SMEs will influence the perceived behavioral intention to use (ITU) an app application for knowledge management, thus giving rise to increased usage of knowledge management technology, thus giving rise to a positive attitude towards usage (ATU) of knowledge management technology. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Knowledge management; Mobile application; SEM; SMEs","Economic analysis; Intelligent computing; International trade; Knowledge based systems; Research and development management; Scanning electron microscopy; Software design; Surveys; Design and Development; Knowledge management system; Knowledge management technology; Mobile applications; Research and development; Small and medium scale enterprise; SMEs; Software development methodologies; Knowledge management",,,,"Binus University: 23/AKM/MONOPNT/ 2019","Acknowledgement.

The objective of this research is to analyze the correlation among the perceived ease of use(PEOU) variable, voluntaries use(VU) variable, perceived entertainment value (PEV) variable, perceived usefulness (PU) variable and factor of Web usage attitude (WU) which is a factor influencing the technology acceptance model of knowledge management in small and medium enterprises. The method of research is explanatory research which aims to analyze the relationship between one variable stage above. The Data collection techniques used in this study is a questionnaire using semantic differential scale and explained the research design, data retrieval, data processing and data analysis. Data analysis used in analyzing factors of technological acceptance model (TAM) in the application of Knowledge Management in small medium enterprises in creative economy is descriptive statistics to consider a frequency distribution the size and spread of data on characteristics of the sample (respondents) and indicator variable endogenous and provide explanation of its mean value, standard deviations, variant, maximum, range, skewness and kurtosis. Statistical analysis inferential using structural equation model (SEM). The result of this paper is the technology acceptance model of knowledge management small medium enterprises influenced by the ease of use (PEOU) which will cause the advantage in using (PU) because of advantage in using the user will be willing (have willingness) in using (VU), so that have an attitude of the use of Web Knowledge Management (WU) © 2017 The Authors.

The need for a web for every teacher or lecturer in building multi-channel learning process is a challenge of building the advanced education itself. The objective of this research is to create a web application design with the use of Information Technology and Telecommunication (ICT) or SMS Gateway of academic information. The method of the research used by the author is Field Research, where data collection was done through direct observation on the users in order to obtain as much information as possible from the users to learn what the users want in the making of SMS Gateway information system. Meanwhile, the methodology of the software development is using the Rapid Application Development (RAD) or Prototype model approach. For the design analysis of the academic information SMS Gateway system, the author used the Object Oriented Analysis Design (OOAD) approach using the Use Case Diagram, Sequence Diagram, Class Diagram and web application implementation using PHP and MySql software as well as SMS Gateway software with Gammu. The conclusion of this research is that the use of academic information SMS Gateway on college or university students is very effective for the learning activity process and institution service quality improvement as well as for helping the lecturers to obtain information of their students' quiz score real time. The result of this research is that the mastery of science and technology through the academic information SMS Gateway application prototype creation. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

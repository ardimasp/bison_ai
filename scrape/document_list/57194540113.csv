The fact, many companies have failed to implement ERP which is proven to be not go live on time, so that the implementation value is to be very expensive. For this reason, it is important to consider other methods that can reduce failures in implementing ERP that are reviewed from the perspective of readiness assessment. Based on previous research, there are some challenging on the ERP readiness assessment. We also found that some areas on the ERP readiness that still not explore more serious such as ERP and agile method. Therefore, based on the challenging and open are on the ERP readiness, we will explore more development the framework of ERP readiness assessment using agile parameters to help the industry. The purpose of this research is to identify gaps and propose improvements which are the weaknesses in order to improve performance of the organization. The result of this research is developing the framework using an agile parameter for determination of the ERP readiness assessment with a case study in the textile industry in Indonesia. Hopefully, this research has contribution as a measurement tool for assessing the organizational readiness in order to increase agility in the industry. This research methodology uses the combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods using the NVivo software as a result of FGD data processing and using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity (TOPSIS) for validation and verification tests. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Productivity is a demand for improving organizational performance. ERP systems are a way to increase productivity. Therefore, ERP implementation is important to ensure that ERP runs well. Critical factors in ERP implementation must get serious attention to project management. Even so, the reality of ERP implementation is slowly, even tends to experience failure, resulting in highly expensive. The previous research that carried out ERP implementation showed that the failure reached 40%, and the achievement of the benefits of ERP implementation in Indonesia is still not optimal. It can be said that ERP implementation is a complexity project. For this reason, it is necessary to consider other implementation methods that can overcome the problem in implementing ERP. An agile method is a proactive and reactive alternative to handle the problem in implementing of ERP. The development of an agile ERP model is one way to achieve success in ERP implementation. This research methodology is a survey approach to the study of literature. This research will propose an agile ERP model which will be used as an effective guide for achieving the success of ERP implementation. © 2019 IEEE.","agile ERP model; agile method; ERP implementation","Information management;

Therefore, ERP system is important strategy for organization's survival. One of the critical issues that affect a successful ERP implementation is the implementation method. In previous research, it showed that many organizations had faced complexity when they were implementing ERP in order to meet their requirements. In other cases, the ERP systems are unable to provide solution which is a simplicity of the necessary business processes. The ERP implementation complexity is one of the factors that lead the failures. Thus, here, we intend to propose an agile approach to reduce complexity and eventually our intention is to improve ERP implementing to become more successful. In this study, we are employing a systematic literature review (SLR) approach to identify the principles factors of the agile methods for ERP implementation. In result of employing this SLR method, we found that agile values and principles are correlated in ERP implementation complexity. © 2018 IEEE.","agile methods; complexity; ERP implementation; systematic literature review","Agile manufacturing systems; Information management; Agile approaches; Agile methods; Business environments; Business Process; complexity; ERP implementation; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Enterprise resource planning",,,,,"Alleman, G.B., Agile project management methods for ERP: How to apply agile processes to complex COTS projects and live to tell about it (2002) Conference on Extreme Programming and Agile Methods, , Springer; Amid, A., Moalagh, M., Ravasan, A.Z., (2012) Identification and classification of ERP critical failure factors in Iranian industries; Ali, M., Miller, L., Erp system implementation in large enterprises-A systematic literature review (2017) Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 30, p. 4; Baig, J.J.A., Shah, A., Sajjad, F., Evaluation of agile methods for quality assurance and quality control in ERP implementation (2017) Intelligent Computing and Information Systems (ICICIS), 2017 Eighth International Conference on, pp. 252-257. , IEEE; Bansal, V., Negi, T., A metric for ERP complexity (2008) International Conference on Business Information Systems, pp. 369-379. , Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg; Baramichai, M., Zimmers, E.W., Jr., Marangos, C.A., Agile supply chain transformation matrix: An integrated tool for creating an agile enterprise.

The ERP systems as basic to consider evaluating performance achievement as a tool for analyzing, evaluating and support decision making. In the reality, the managers have problems using ERP systems to making decisions and ultimately improve the synchronization of business strategy. This research attempts to present how to ERP systems can support making decision using a dashboard systems to achievement the performance of organizations. The methodology used in this research involves the survey for analytic hierarchy business process. This research is expected that such a model may be used organizations to assessment the efficiency of the ERP system and can be used in evaluating, assessment, and the organizations can be able to increase competitive advantage. © 2016 IEEE.","Dashboard system; Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems","Competition; Decision making; Efficiency; Information management; Societies and institutions; Analytic hierarchy; Business Process; Business strategy; Competitive advantage; Dashboard system; Enterprise resource planning systems; Improving performance; Making decision; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,"Aladwani, A.M., Change management strategies for successful ERP implementation (2001) Journal of Business Process Management, 7 (3), pp. 266-275; Selmeci, A., Orosz, I., Gyorok, G., Orosz, T., Key Performance Indicators used in ERP performance measurement applications (2012) Journal of SISY IEEE 10th Jubilee International Symposium on Intelligent System and Informatics; Raj Singla, A., Impact of ERP system on small and mid sized public sector enterprises (2005) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology JATIT; Janie Chang, C., Ingraham, L.R., (2007) Modeling and Designing Accounting Systems, , John Wiley & Sons,USA; Davenport, T.H., The future of enterprise system enabled organizations (2000) Journal Information Systems Frontiers, p. 163; Leary, D.E.O., Enterprise resources planning systems (2009) Life Cycle, Electronic Commerce, and Risk, , Cambridge University Press.

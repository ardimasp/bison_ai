The method used is by questionnaires, interviews, observation, and literature study. The result of this research is NYAM app that can search for food based on GPS, categories, and types and this app can facilitate the search for suitable eating place where user can see restaurant profiles, comments, like, and amenities rating, hygiene, and service, as well as restaurant owners, can promote a place to eat in this application. Most of the respondents find out that the application was easy to use (94.10%), and features were easy to understand (89.1%). The majority of the respondents (84.10%) will continue to use the NYAM system because they find the NYAM system was helping them to find the best restaurant to have their meals with a decent price and have good tastes (88.40%). © 2018 The Authors.

Generally, this technique converts the input image into an editable format in computer. This paper uses several techniques as a comparison for some extracted features, such as: zoning algorithm, projection profile, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and combination of those feature extractions (zoning + projection, projection + HOG, zoning + HOG, zoning + projection + HOG). For the evaluation of the proposed system, this paper compare the most commonly classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This experiment achieves the highest accuracy of 94.43% using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with the feature extraction algorithms are:projection profile and the combination of zoning + projection profile. © 2017 The Authors.

Inappropriate or unproductive land will impact to productivity decrease, time-consuming, and profit lost. Determining and evaluating the optimal land suitability can be done through prediction of each production area that is obtained by analyzing land fitness data. This study proposes the implementation of Neural Network and Swarm Optimization Algorithm (Particle Swarm Optimization & Cat Swarm Optimization) to obtain prediction of production. To evaluate the proposed method, this study performed comparative evaluation based on the Mean Square Error (MSE) and accuracy. Based on the experimental results, Cat Swarm Optimization produces minimum error equal of 0.00439 for training phase and 0.10453 for testing phase. In training phase, Cat Swarm Optimization produces higher accuracy (93%) than Particle Swarm Optimization (67%). © 2016 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Cat swarm optimization; Land suitability; Neural network; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm optimization algorithm",,,,,,"Brambilla, I., Porto, G.G., Farm Productivity and Market Structure.

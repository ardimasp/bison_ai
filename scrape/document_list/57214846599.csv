The web application facility allows students to easily find information related to education and the business world. This study aims to analyze the direct and indirect (mediated by the academic atmosphere) effects of web application facilities on student satisfaction. Research respondents were Postgraduate Program students majoring in Management Masters. Structural Equational Model (SEM) with PLS and SPSS Program were used in the data processing. The results of this study indicate that (1) Web application facilities did not have effects on student satisfaction; (2) The application facilities affect student satisfaction if mediated by the academic atmosphere. There has not been much research in Indonesia because the web usage program is new in Indonesian education. The research results contribute to the development of consumer behavior models. Web application facilities assist soft data storage for accreditation purposes and accelerating graduation of quality students to construct a conducive atmosphere affecting student satisfaction. © IJSTR 2019.","Academic; Application; Atmosphere; Facilities; Satisfaction; Student; Web",,,,,,"(2012) Marketing Management, 80 (2012), p. 76. , 14 th Edition, Prentice-Hall; Engel, E.E., Discretionary Behavior with Respect to Allowances for Loan Losses and the Behavior of Security Prices (1996) Journal of Accounting & Economics, 22, pp. 177-206. , Agustus-Desember; Engel.

Growth in the use of social media is forcing companies to use social media as their marketing tools to enhance relationships with consumers and to create brand awareness. The authors observed how e-commerce websites in Indonesia benefit from the use of social media for their business, focusing on the correlations of the Facebook content posted by the two top e-commerce sites in Indonesia - Shopee and Tokopedia - to build trust among consumers. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the impact of the content posted by the company, and the number of comments and likes. For the purposes of this study, 'number of shares' was used as a proxy for trust. The results of the analysis showed a significant impact among trust, posts, comments, and likes. At the end of the study we made a social media share software application design with a Waterfall design method and object-oriented programming concept. © 2019 IEEE.","facebook; shopee; social media; social media analytics; tokopedia","Application programs; Electronic commerce; Information management; Object oriented programming; Regression analysis; Facebook; shopee; Social media; Social media analytics; tokopedia; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Arora, A., Bansal, S., Measuring social media influencer indexinsights from facebook, Twitter and Instagram (2019) Journal of Retailingand Consumer Services, 49, pp. 86-101; Chen, S., Lin, C., Understanding the effect of social media marketing activities: The mediation of social indentification, preceived value, and satisfication (2019) Technological Forecasting & Social Change, 140, pp. 22-32; Sharma, R., Alavi, S., Ahuja, V., Generating trust using facebook-a study of 5 online apparel (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 122, pp. 42-49; Kurnia, P.F., Suharjito, Business intelligence model to analyze social media informatio (2018) Procedia Computer Science, 135, pp. 5-14; Holsapplea, C.W., Hsiaob, S., Pakathc, R., Business social media analytics: Characterization and conceptual framework (2018) Decision Support System, 110, pp. 32-45; Hashima, K.F., Fadhilb, N.A., Engaging with customer using social media platform: A case study of Malaysia hotels (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 124, pp. 4-11; Gulbahara, M.O., Yildirima, F., Marketing efforts related to social media channels and mobile application usage in tourism: Case study in istanbul (2015) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 195, pp. 453-462; Tikno, Measuring performance of facebook advertising based on media used: A case study on online shops in Indonesia (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 111, pp. 105-112; Latiffa, Z.A., Safieeb, N.A.S., New business set up for branding strategies on social media-instagram (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 72, pp. 13-23; Syuhada, A.A., Gambetta, W., Online marketplace for Indonesian micro small and medium enterprises based on social media (2013) Procedia Technology, 11, pp. 446-454; Liu, R., Suh, A., Self-branding on social media: An analysis of style bloggers on instagram (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 124, pp. 12-20; Stieglitza, S., Mirbabaiea, M., Rossa, B., Neubergerb, C., Social media analytics-challenges in topic discovery, data collection, and data preparation (2018) International Journal of Information Management, 39, pp. 156-168; Lee, I., Social media analytcs for enterprises: Typology, methods, and processes (2018) Business Horizons, 61, pp. 199-210; Safuullah, M., Pathak, P., Singh, S., Anshul, A., Socia media as an upcoming tool for political marketing effectiveness (2017) Asia Pacific Management Review, 22, pp. 10-15; Misirlis, N., Vlachpoulou, M., Social media metrics and analytics in marketing-S3M: A mapping literature review (2018) International Hournal of Information Management, 38, pp. 270-276; Muningera, M.I., Hammedib, W., Mahrc, D., The value of social media for innovation: Acapability perspective (2019) Journal of Business Research, 95, pp. 116-127; Vidya, N.A., Fanany, M.I., Budi, I., Twitter sentiment to analyze net brand reputation of mobile phone providers (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 72, pp. 519-526; Zavala, A., Ramirez-Marqueza, J.E., Visual analytics for identifying product disruptions and e-ects via social media (2019) International Journal of Production Economics, 208, pp. 544-559; Shane-Simpson, C., Manago, A., Why do college students prefer Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram?

The objective of this research is to represent knowledge and retrieve the answer for a given question by utilizing Vector Space Model. While some mechanisms have been developed in question answering system such as N-gram, template-driven response, reversible transformation, etc., an attempt to use Vector Space Model is conducted. The query will be compared to the knowledge based by measuring their similarity. Data sample to test the model comes from 2 Ministers of Indonesia; they are The Minister of Education and Culture and The Minister of Tourism andCreative Economy Culture. In the experiment, 150 questions are given to the system. Each question words are given 25 questions. The experiment gives 0.662 of recall, 0.548 of precision, and 0.580 of F-measure. But unfortunately it needs around 29 seconds in average to give the answer to the users. © 2015 The Authors.

Advances in information technology companies make every attempt to improve its internal business processes. To optimize its business processes, companies should not only be oriented to internal processes, but rather an external process that involves a relationship with the companies involved as a business. XYZ Corporation is a company engaged in manufacturing plastic household goods. The resulting products include a variety of bottles (which are used for soap, lotion, shampoo, and ink), bottle caps, cans, mannequin body fit, and others. XYZ is facing problems of a delay in arrival of raw materials, stock-checking errors, and delays in delivery of goods to the customer. Based on the problems that arise, the authors propose to use the e-SCM applications to XYZ because the e-SCM can help coordinate all the activities of the supply chain from raw material procurement to distribution to the customer, especially considering the number of suppliers that work with XYZ. © 2014 SERSC.","7C's strategy; E-Business; E-SCM; Five porter forces; QSPM; SCM","7C's strategy; E-SCM; eBusiness; Five porter forces; QSPM; SCM; Bottles; Competition; Contracts; Supply chains; Information technology",,,,,"Hendricks, K.B., Singhal, V.R., Stratman, J.K., The impact of enterprise systems on corporate performance: A study of ERP, SCM, and CRM system implementations (2007) Journal of Operations Management, 25, pp. 65-82; Gimenez, C., Lourenco, R.H., E-SCM: Internet's Impact on Supply Chain Processes (2008) International Journal of Logistics Management, 19, pp. 309-343; Chaffey, D., (2010) E-Business and E-Commerce Management: Strategy, Implementation and Practice, , New Jersey: Prentice Hall; Schneider, G.P., (2011) E-Business, , Canada: Cengage Learning; Turban, E., King, D., Lee, J., Liang, T.-P., Turban, D., (2010) Electronic Commerce 2010 a Managerial Perspective, , New Jersey: Pearson; David, F.R., (2011) Strategic Management: Concepts and Cases, , 13th ed.

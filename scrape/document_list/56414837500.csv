There are three social intervention solutions conducted during October 2014 to January 2015 in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, as part of Social Psychology and Psychological Intervention Course Program that will be discussed in detail, namely 1) intervention toward the observer’s (bystander’s) attitude toward the violence to be a preventer of the violence (or, to be an upstander), 2) intervention eliminating women objectification among men, and 3) intervention reducing verbal violent behavior against women. All those three will be discussed in an intervention methods of PATH, a model constructed by Abraham P. Buunk and Mark Van Vugt (2013) consisting of four stages, i.e. Problem formulation (Problem), Analysis and explanation (Analyze), Test stages (Test) and Intervention implementation (Help). The intervention targets are the students, the late teens, and the young adults through 1) Handbook of Violence Prevention to offer support and assistance for the actual and potential victims of domestic violence, 2) the campaign via radio mass media for prevention of women objectification, as well as 3) the delivery of contemplative messages through shirt and pin for verbal abuse prevention. © 2015, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

In the midst of controversy around video games, the businesses of the games continue to grow and run exponentially. It is pivotal to optimize the potential and real benefits of video games, either in the field of education, sports, entertainment, or health. It needs involving psychological approaches to do so. This predictive-correlational research posits that emotional awareness and thinking style are affective and cognitive aspects that need to be considered in designing video games that can bring a positive attitude. A study on 153 high school students (Mage =16.41 years old; SDage =0.983 years) in Bekasi, Indonesia, with multiple regression data analysis, showed that there are unique contributions of the two predictors to the attitude whose effects are moderated by types of game players (expert vs. novice). © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

This research used a qualitative method namely interview with 20 participants (9 males, 11 females) age of 21-46 years old of various occupations (student, lecturer, trader, employee, etc.) and ethnicities (Chinese, Javanese, Betawinese, and Maduranese) who still give money or goods to beggars when this research was conducted. During the interview process, the authors provided intervention to participants in the form of fear communication and minimal counseling with the purpose to divert their intention of giving to beggars into giving of the donation through authorized disseminator of social assistance. This research found that factors such as religion, compassion, institutional corruption, and law enforcement play important roles in determining preferred target of prosocial behavior. Nevertheless, the cognitive-emotional intervention conducted by the authors was successful, which was indicated by the fact of 12 of the 20 participants agreeing to divert their target of prosocial behavior. © 2014, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

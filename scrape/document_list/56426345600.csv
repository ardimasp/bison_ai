The reason is because company wants to reduce investment and maintenance cost by investing on single integrated network rather than traditional separated telecommunication, broadcasting and internet network. In this research, we use top down network design approach to create converged network design that tailored to fulfill the requirement from business and technical aspects. It is started by analyzing design requirement, perform logical and physical design, and perform design testing. Both data and voice traffic should be working well in converged network. In order to optimize the network design, the quality of service (QoS) will be considered. It will be used to accomodate various kind of traffic in this network. Simulation and experiment results show that the proposed network design can satisfy required QoS of converged service network. The proposed network design also performs better availability compared to the existing network design. © 2018 The Authors.

The robot is usually completed with load and weighting mechanism. This paper presents an alternative weighting mechanism of active mode rehabilitation robot by using spiral spring as load source. PI controller is used to ensure the link reaching its last position by controlling the angular position of DC motor. Then, the link is slowly decreased to avoid the knocking. Mathematical model of the system is derived and root locus analysis is utilized to obtain the parameter of the control algorithm. Using the proposed mechanism and method, the experimental shows effective results. © 2017 IEEE.","PI controller; rehabilitation robot; root locus; spiral spring; weighting mechanism","Controllers; DC motors; Electric machine control; Position control; Robots; Root loci; Active mode; Angular positions; Load sources; Lower arm; PI Controller; Rehabilitation robot; Root locus analysis; Patient rehabilitation",,,,,"ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by Medical Laboratory at Institut Teknologi Bandung.","(2012) Heart and Stroke Statistics Update, , http://www.Americanheart.org/statistics/stroke.htm, American Heart Association; (2013) Prevention-What is A Stroke, , http://www.nasam.org/english/preventionwhat_is_a, NASAM-National Stroke Association of Malaysia; Fisher, S., Lucas, L., Thrasher, T.A., Robot-assisted gait training for patients with hemiparesis due to stroke (2011) Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation., 18 (3), pp. 269-276. , June; Cheng, P.Y., Lai, P.Y., Comparison of exoskeleton robots and end-effector robots on training methods and gait biomechanics (2013) Intelligent Robotics and Applications, pp. 258-266; Krebs, H., Ferraro, M., Buerger, S., Newbery, M., Makiyama, A., Sandmann, M., Lynch, D., Hogan, N., Rehabilitation robotics: Pilot trial of a spatial extension for MIT-Manus (2004) Journal of NeuroEngineerung and Rehabilitation, 1, p. 5; Lum, P.S., Burgar, C.G., Van Den Loos, M., Shor, P.C., Majmundar, M., Yap, R., MIME robotic device for upper-limb neurorehabilitation in subacute stroke subjects: A follow-up study (2006) J Rehabil Res Dev, 43, pp. 631-642. , Aug-Sep; Masiero, S., Armani, M., Rosati, G., Upper-limb robot-assisted therapy in rehabilitation of acute stroke patients: Focused review and results of new randomized controlled trial (2011) Journal of Rehabilitaion Research and Development, pp. 355-366; Naidu, D., Stopforth, R., Bright, G., Davrajh, S., A portable passive physiotherapeutic exoskeleton (2012) International Journal of Advanced Robotic System, 9, p. 137; Nef, T., Guidali, M., Klamroth-Marganska, V., Riener, R., ARMin-exoskeleton robot for stroke rehabilitation (2009) World Congress on Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, pp. 127-130; Yoa, H.S., (2012) Hand Rehabilitation Robot to Train Reaching Movement for Stroke Patient, , Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Master of Engineering thesis; Kikuchi, T., Jin, Y., Fukushima, K., Akai, H., Furusho, J., Study on development of active-passive rehabilitation system for upper limbs: Hybrid-PLEMO (2009) 11th Conference on Electrorheological Fluids and Magnetorheological Suspensions; Gonzalez, O., Villegas, J., Aguilr, I., Rodriguez, O., Tripicchio, P., Ramos, M., Cuautle, A., Avizzano, C., Design and development of a hand exoskeleton robot for active and passive rehabilitation (2016) Internatinal Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems; Zhang, Z., Fang, Q., Gu, X., Objective asessment of upper-limb mobility for poststroke rehabilitation (2016) IEEE Transaction on Biomedical Engineering, 63, pp. 859-869; (2015) Springs Calculation, , http://www.mitcalc.com/doc/springs/help/en/springs.htm, MIT Calculation; Zaccarian, L., DC motors: Dynamic model and control techniques (2012) Lecture Notes, , Roma, Italy; Ogata, K., (2002) Modern Control Engineering, , 4th Edition, Prentice Hall, United State of America; Wang, Q., Lee, T., Fung, H., Bi, Q., Zhang, Y., PID tuning for improved performance (1999) IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology, 7 (4), pp. 457-465. , Jul",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","5th International Conference on Instrumentation, Control, and Automation, ICA 2017","9 August 2017 through 11 August 2017",,131153,,9781538603499,,,"English","Proc.

This factor can be reduced if the drowsy condition of the driver can be identified and alarmed. This research is conducted by using Electroencephalography approach to detect drowsy state of the driver using Mindwave. Mindwave will sense the value changes of the driver's awareness caused by changes in concentration value. The changes between conscious and drowsiness state are mapped and used as threshold values for triggering the alarm. Result shows that the drowsy state is detected when the average value of low-alpha is below 0.7, the high-alpha value fall below 0.6 and the theta values is below 0.7 from the normal condition. The low-alpha values are sufficient enough to show the condition of drowsiness, but the high-alpha and theta value can be used to minimize the false alarm event. DrowTion application is developed based on this result. DrowTion is implemented with Mindwave headset with the capability of minimizing false alarm and having the capability of giving multiple alarms. Accuracy of DrowTion application in normal condition is about 68,11%. © 2014 IEEE.","drowsiness detection application; DrowTion; EEG; low-alpha value","Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Errors; Highway accidents; Average values; Concentration values; Driver drowsiness; Drowsiness detection; Drowsy driver; DrowTion; low-alpha value; Normal condition; Alarm systems",,,,,,"Konstantin, P., (2014) Statistics Related to Drowsy Driver Crashes, , http://americanindian.net/sleepstats.html, last accessed: July 18; (2014) Ford Active City Stop, , http://www.euroncap.com/rewards/Ford-ActiveCityStop.aspx, Euro NCAP last accessed: March 19; Grace, R., Steward, S., Drowsy driver monitor and warning system (2001) First International Driving Symposium on Human Factors in Driver Assessment, Training and Vehicle Design, pp. 64-69. , Iowa University; Development of a drowsiness warning system using neural network International Journal of Advanced Research in Electrical, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, 2, pp. 3614-3623. , Itenderpal Singh and Banga Issue 8, August 2013; Knipling, R.R., Wierwille, W.W., Vehicle-based drowsy driver detection: Current status and future prospects (1994) IVHS America Fourth Annual Meeting, , Atlanta, GA April; Lakshmi, N.S.S., Vardhan, T.J., Design and development of warning system for drowsy drivers (2013) International Journal of Scientific and Research Publications, 3 (11). , November; Jones, C., Using brain-computer interfaces to analyze eeg data for safety improvement (2010) Team for Research in Ubiquitous Secure Technology; Pinel, J.P.J., (1992) Biopsychology, , Needham Heights, MA Allyn & Bacon; Dement, W.C., (1978) Some Must Watch while Some Must Sleep, , New York: W.W.

This paper's aim is to introduce the more interesting and interactive way to introduce Tais. Utilization of Augmented Reality (AR) technology in an application built with the Unity3D program is done to provide different way in presenting interesting and interactive information to its users. Based on the results in this paper, the developed application can handle the presentation in more interesting and interactive way. The ideal distance in the tracking process for target objects with size 7 x 6 cm is ranged from 6 cm to 30 cm, with the image ratio that can be detected at the farthest distance is 4% of the camera image. For the detection angle, the target object can be detected properly from approximately ±640. From the data acquired, it can be said that AR can be used to introduce Tais in more interesting and interactive way. © 2018 The Authors.

By using force limiting (FL) feature, where the force of the arm robot is limited and controlled, the robot can sense collision and stop its movement when it occurs. The idea is to apply the mentioned concept for service purposes. In this research a 6-axis arm robot with collision detection is developed. The design of the arm robot adopted the design of Universal Robot's UR3 with each joint capable of 360° rotation. The design approach is chosen for its flexibility to work in tight space with a maximum reach of half meter, as it is intended to work closely with human. This initial version robot is not intended to carry heavy load or move at high precision. With a maximum load of one Kg, this arm robot targets numerous applications that help human to do complex repetitive tasks, extend the reach of human operators, and help humans on many daily chores that usually does not involve heavy loads. The whole frame, which also serve as the cover of the robot, was made by 3D printing with multiple materials that fit to the strength and temperature requirement at each part of the robot. In order to detect collision, the arm robot employed smart servos at each joint with the ability to detect overcurrent and overvoltage, which allow the implementation of force limiting (FL) feature that will stop the robot in case of collision. The resulting arm robot managed to lift1 kg load and able stop its movement in the event of collision. Future research to improve the movement precision of the arm robot by adaptive methods is promising. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","3D Printing; Arm robot; Collaborative; Force Limiting; Service Robot","3D printers; Mobile robots; 3-D printing; Adaptive methods; Collaborative; Collision detection; Design approaches; Force Limiting; Multiple materials; Service robots; Machine design",,,,,"Cherubini, A., Passama, R., Crosnier, A., Lasnier, A., Fraisse, P., Collaborative manufacturing with physical human-robot interaction (2016) Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 40, pp. 1-13; Matthias, B., Kock, S., Jerregard, H., Kallman, M., Lundberg, I., Safety of collaborative industrial robots: Certification possibilities for a collaborative assembly robot concept (2011) 2011 IEEE International Symposium on Assembly and Manufacturing (ISAM), p. 1; (2011) Robots and Robotic Devices-Safety Requirements for Industrial Robots-Part 1: Robots, ISO/CD 10218-1; (2016) Robots and Robotic Devices-Collaborative Robots, ISO/TS 15066; (2012) Robots and Robotic Devices - Vocabulary, ISO 8373; Kufieta, K., (2014); Sobron, L., Sutanto, D., Pengaruh Posisi Orientasi Objek Pada Proses Rapid Prototyping 3D Printing Terhadap Kekuatan Tarik Material Polymer (2016) Sinergi, 20 (3), p. 229; Thamrin, I., Analisa Tegangan-regangan Struktur Pegas Daun Akibat Modifikasi Penekanan (2009) Jurnal Rekayasa Mesin Universitas Sriwijaya",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

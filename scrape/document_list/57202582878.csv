This is due to inability of the current technology to support the property products. Some people feel uncomfortable to buy houses from the online market. Buyers need to be very careful to deal with the sellers as the houses price is considered quite expensive. On the other hand, improving real estate market is still a challenge. This business still needs a physical representation, although it can be sold from the online market. In this paper, we propose the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) system of virtual reality and drone. We use drone to help scanning the property units and then make 3D models with visual mapping so it can be run in a virtual reality environment, video 360. In real estate, business process can be developed in various ways. Our proposed SOA in this study can be used to integrate all of them. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,"Nabila, M., (2018) APJII: Penetrasi Pengguna Internet Indonesia Capai, p. 143. , www.dailysocial.id/post/apjii-survei-internet-Indonesia-2017, access date 10 April Juta Orang; (2018) Statista Research Department, Number of Internet Users in Indonesia, , https://www.statista.com/statistics/254456/number-of-internet-users-in-Indonesia/, access date 09 April; Ma, Y., Sun, L., On relationship between real estate enterprise e-business model and its performance (2010) 2010 International Conference on Web Information Systems and Mining, p. 171; Xiong-Yi, L., Research and application of soa in b2b electronic commerce (2009) 2009 International Conference on Computer Technology and Development, p. 649; Cherif, E., Grant, D., Analysis of e-business models in real estate (2013) Electronic Commerce Research, 14, pp. 25-50; Footen, J., Service-oriented architecture (SOA) in media systems (2009) SMPTE Motion Imaging Journal, 118, pp. 33-37; Rao, B., Gopi, A.G., Maione, R., The societal impact of commercial drones (2016) Technology in Society, 45, pp. 83-90; Exner, K., Stark, R., Validation of product-service systems in virtual reality (2015) Procedia CIRP, 30, pp. 96-101; Mesbah, A., (2015) Advances in Computers, pp. 201-235. , ed A.

Even though, Jakarta city is implementing the smart city concept. Smart city is a dream for every city in the world because it makes the city more effective, efficient, and worth living by implementing technology. Therefore, Jakarta have to be able to pay attention with the problems that is arise along with the rapid of technology by changing dynamically. One of the technology development that can answer the challenges of Jakarta city is drone. Drone utilization has brings a lot of benefits to be implemented in smart city. However, it must be remain vigilant in smart cities that apply using drones. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Ministry of transportation has enacted Law No. 180/2015 and No. PM 47/2016 which have been legally replaced Law No. 90/2015 about controlling the operation of unmanned aircraft in the Indonesia air space [11]. This law was only inaugurated on May 12, 2015 which includes banning drone operation in restricted air areas, restricted air space, and in flight operation safety area of an airport. 3. Research Methodology The research methodology using systematic literature review is the aim in order to acquire the goals. The results in this study is a drone recommendation framework that is integrated with the Jakarta Smart City and Qlue apps. The research boundary of this paper is drone challenges in Jakarta as a smart city.","Walton, C., (2018) Amazon Go Has Been Flawed from the Get-Go; Katadata, (2018) Berapa Jumlah Penduduk Jakarta? - Databoks; Sitinjak, E., Meidityawati, B., Ichwan, R., Onggosandojo, N., Aryani, P., (2018) Procedía Eng., 212, pp. 222-229; Cities, O.F., (2016) Trends ín Smart City Development, , (Washington DC: National League Of Cities); Statista, (2018) · Commercial Drone Market Revenue Projection - Asia Pacific 2025 | Statistic, , | Statistic; Khan, M.A., (2018), pp. 1-7. , IEEE; Lacinák, M., Ristvej, J., (2017) Procedia Eng., 192, pp. 522-527; Mohammed, F., Idries, A., Mohamed, N., Al-Jaroodi, J., Jawhar, I., (2014) International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, , (Orlando,) IEEE Conference; Kardasz, P., Doskocz, J., (2016) Journal of Civil Environmental Engineering, 6 (3), pp. 1-7; Jensen, O.B., (2016) Geographica Helvetica, 71 (2), pp. 67-75. , 7; Menteri Perhubungan Republik, I., (2010) Peraturan Menteri Perhubungan Republik Indonesia, p. 13. , (Republik Indones: Mentri Perhub); Rudi, A., (2014) Seperti Apa Cara Kerja Jakarta Smart City?, , Kompas.com; INRIX 2005 About INRIX; Samson, A., (2016) Nokia and Europe's First Drone-based Smart City Traffic Management Test Facility Collaborate to Ensure Safe Global Aerial Operations, , (Nokia); Taboh, J., Lapidus, F., (2016) Drone Digunakan Untuk Kirim Obat di Rwanda; Husten, L., (2014) Grad Student Invents Flying Ambulance Drone to Deliver Emergency Shocks; Hutson, M., (2017) Hurricanes Show Why Drones Are the Future of Disaster Relief; Unicef, (2017) STORM-HARVEY/; Restas, A., (2015) World J.

This application is designed by using a Waterfall Model, a 5-phase model that is Communication, Planning, Modeling, Construction, and Deployment starting from as the aforementioned steps. Based on the responds we get from distributing questionnaire, many people didn't know how to exercise properly and didn't bother to check the calories of their food. Their weight is also a problem because most of them still have an Overweight or Underweight status. From those responds, we can conclude that our application will indeed help people to get and maintain their ideal body weight. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Food calorie; Ideal body weight; Waterfall model",,,,,,,"Sparling, P.B., Howard, B.J., Dunstan, D.W., Owen, N., Recommendations for physical activity in older adults (2015) Bmj, 350, pp. h100-h100; Patki, S.M., Madhavi, P., Reddy, B.C., Madhavi, K.V.P., (2014) knowledge and attitude regarding dietary habits among secondary school children in khammam town, 3, pp. 3468-3475; Dixon, J.B., (2010) Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology The effect of obesity on health outcomes, 316, pp. 104-108; (2013), Singapore Management University; Digital Media in Indonesia; Nandkishor, B.R., Android Smartphone Based Body Area Network for Monitoring and Evaluation of Medical Parameters (2014) Architecture ABAN, pp. 284-288; Fling, B., (2009) Mobile Design and Development, , United State of America: O'Reilly Media; Safaat, N., (2014) Android: Pemrograman Aplikasi Mobile Smartphone Dan Tablet Pc Berbasis Android, , Bandung: INFORMATIKA; Connolly, T., Begg, C., (2015) Database Systems: A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation, and Management, , London: Pearson Education; Welling, L., Thomson, L., (2009) PHP and MySQL® Web Development, , United State of America: Addison-Wesley; Adams, E., (2014) Fundamentals of Game Design, , 3rd ed; Shneiderman, B., Plaisant, C., (2010) Designing the user interface: strategies for effective human-computer-interaction, , 5th ed.

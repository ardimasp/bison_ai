A consumer act as a seller put their product in a platform later will be displayed to another consumer act as a buyer. This condition encourages platform to maintain high quality product information especially image that is provided by the seller. Product images need to be relevant to the product itself. It can be controlled automatically using image classification. In this paper, we carried out a research to find out the best deep learning model in image classification for e-commerce products. A dataset of 12,500 product images is collected from various web sources to be used in training and testing process. Five models are selected and fine-tuned using a uniform hyperparameter set-up. Those hyperparameters are found by using a manual process by trying a lot of hyperparameters. The testing result from every model is presented and evaluated. The result shows that NASNetLarge yield the best performance among all evaluated models with 84% testing accuracy. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.","Deep learning; E-commerce; Hyperparameter tuning; Image classification; Product images",,,,,"23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019","This work was supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia, through research grant number 23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019.","Das, K., Gryseels, M., Sudhir, P., Tan, K.T., 'Unlocking Indonesia's digital opportunity,' (2016), pp. 1-28. , October; Dan, C., 'Consumer-To-Consumer (C2C) Electronic Commerce: The Recent Picture,' (2014) Int.

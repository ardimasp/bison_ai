Early detection of abnormal blood pressure can help patients to get early treatment and reduce mortality associated with cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it is very valuable to have a mechanism to perform real-time monitoring for blood pressure changes in patients. In this paper, we propose deep learning regression models using an electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) for the real-time estimation of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values. We use a bidirectional layer of long short-term memory (LSTM) as the first layer and add a residual connection inside each of the following layers of the LSTMs. We also perform experiments to compare the performance between the traditional machine learning methods, another existing deep learning model, and the proposed deep learning models using the dataset of Physionet’s multiparameter intelligent monitoring in intensive care II (MIMIC II) as the source of ECG and PPG signals as well as the arterial blood pressure (ABP) signal. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the existing methods and is able to achieve accurate estimation which is promising in order to be applied in clinical practice effectively. © 2020 by the authors.

COVID-19 was since being the headlines of the news offline and online. This trigger either positive or negative responses from the readers, which in turn affect at least the depth of understanding and furthermore the effectiveness of any enforced intervention taken with the purpose to control the transmission of the COVID-19. In order to assess how likely the COVID-19-containing news being forwarded to reach more readers and how the pertinent news bridge further virtual interaction, we crawled data from Twitter as the major online microblogging platform to analyze how likely COVID-19-containing tweets were echoed and what typical tweet about COVID-19 that gained attentions. This is critical to evaluate how people virtually responded against the tweets. Our analyzed data is visualized using Matplotlib by Python and Graph Prism8 accordingly. We figured out that timing and number of followers are not determinative for the tweets being retweeted. Instead, provoking headline add likelihood for the tweets to be moving forward. Also appeared in our analysis that the top two media (Detik and Kompas) shared the same proportion on their tweet type fractions on where information dominated the fraction of their tweets. © 2020 IEEE.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Retweet; Tweet; Twitter","Electronic assessment; Information management; Coronaviruses; Indonesia; Micro-blogging platforms; Offline; Virtual interactions; Social networking (online)",,,,,,"Adhikari, S.P., Meng, S., Wu, Y., Mao, Y., Ye, R., Wang, Q., (2020) Epidemiology, Causes, Clinical Manifestation and Diagnosis, Prevention and Control of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) during the Early Outbreak Period: A Scoping Review, pp. 1-12; (2020) Novel Coronavirus-Japan (Ex China), , https://www.who.int/csr/don/17-january-2020-novel-coronavirusjapan-ex-china/en/, Accessed 9 April 2020; (2020) COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic, , https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/, Worldometer.

The nature of dietary patterns of specific Indonesia population on the risk of colorectal cancer might differ from previously published data with the global population. Therefore, we conducted a study where the dietary pattern in colorectal cancer patient cohorts was compared to age- and population-matched control. We documented 89 colorectal cancer cases and among 173 individuals from the South Sulawesi population. A series of logistic regression and Fisher’s exact tests were utilized to test associations of dietary intakes and colorectal cancer risk as well as colorectal cancer staging. Our data demonstrate that vegetable (p-value = 8.70 × 10−26, OR = 0.49) and fruit (p-value = 7.59x10−5, OR = 0.70) intakes are associated with the reduced risk of colorectal cancer incidence. Conversely, acidic food, reheated food, meat, spicy food, and alcohol are associated with the increment case of cancer. Moreover, meat intake (p-value &lt; 0.01) shows a significant association with cancer staging progression. Common dietary pattern is a determinant aspect to the colorectal cancer incidence as well as its staging progression. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"Mundade, R., Imperiale, T.F., Prabhu, L., Loehrer, P.J., Lu, T., Genetic pathways, prevention, and treatment of sporadic colorectal cancer (2014) Oncoscience, 1 (6), pp. 400-406;

Its purpose was to determine the correlation between independent variables consisting of Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Attitude toward Using (AU) with dependent variable Behavioral Intention to Use (BIU). Data collection techniques were carried out by distributing questionnaires through group discussion forums. Respondents consisted of medical workers and health cadres both in Jakarta and Yogyakarta. Data were analyzed using correlation test and t-test. The results of the correlation test state that the correlation between PEU and AU is 0.30, which shows a weak correlation. Meanwhile, the correlation of PU and AU is 0.56, PEU and BIU is 0.41, and PU and BIU is 0.47, which are considered as moderate correlations. Finally, a strong correlation exists between AU and BIU. T-test results show that the effect of PU on AU is statistically significant with CI = 95%.

To diagnose the strength of DR disease based on examination of the retina. Nowadays, the common diagnosis process asks for experienced ophthalmologists to inspect both fundus image and OCT (optical coherence tomography) images, which is time-consuming and not very convenient for remote rural inhabitants. The research purpose in this paper is to propose a new paradigm of automatic DR diagnosis by using artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Inside the DCNN, we changed max-pooling layers with factional max-pooling. We trained using support vector machine (SVM) to learn the underlying boundary of distribution of each category. Using that proposed method, we achieved the results of the recognition up to 86.17%. We also develop an iPhone APP. It called 'Deep Retina' that equipped with a handheld ophthalmoscope, a layman can take fundus images and perform the diagnosis automatically without intervention from ophthalmologists. It is a practically applicable telemedicine system which benefits the home care, remote medical care, and self-examination. © 2019 IEEE.","CNN; Deep learning; Diabetic retinopathy; SVM; TLBO","Blood vessels; Diagnosis; Eye protection; Ophthalmology; Optical tomography; Pumping plants; Support vector machines; Diabetic retinopathy; Fundus image; Handhelds; Home care; Max-pooling; Remote medical care; Research purpose; Telemedicine systems; Deep learning",,,,,,"http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causesof-death, World Health Organization, Top 10 cause of death; International Diabetes Foundation.

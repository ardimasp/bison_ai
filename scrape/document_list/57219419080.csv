Data is commonly used to help management make better decisions. Data can portray what customers a company is having, what customers want, what are customers characteristics, and so on. At the insurance companies, the use of data can help marketing to create a campaign that right on targeted segment. Insurance companies can create a campaign that aim to target potential customers with certain demographics labeled on them, such as income, educational background, age, etc. This work describes data mining approaches aim to build a predictive model. CRISP-DM framework is used to define the processes and tasks in data mining projects. This study will use K-means clustering technique. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

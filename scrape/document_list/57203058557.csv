This brings a successfully decreasing in the amount of baggage mishandling. SITA 2017 reported that during 10 years until 2016 there is increasing of airline passengers, but decreasing in the amount of mishandled baggage. Many people believe that this great achievement was caused by IT implementation in baggage handling system in airport, including the massive use of RFID for baggage identification tool. Indonesia as one of the countries with the largest population had a significant increasing amount of air passengers and their baggage, that is 15% from 2015 to 2016. Until now this huge number of air baggage is stil manually handled, so Indonesia is facing a serious problem of handling the huge amount of baggage that keep growing. This paper is a preliminary literature study to iniate the development of RFID based baggage handling system in Indonesia. The research question is what is design considerations to develop RFID based baggage handling system. © 2017 IEEE.","baggage handling management; baggage handling system; RFID; systematic literature review","Airport security; Design; Information management; Materials handling equipment; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Airline passengers; Baggage handling system; Design considerations; Identification tools; Literature reviews; Literature studies; Research questions; Systematic literature review; Baggage handling",,,,,"(2017) Air Transport Industry Insights, the Baggage Report, , SITA; Ventura, B., BPS: Jumlah penumpang pesawat tahun 2016 capai 95,2 Juta (2017) Sindonews.com; Wyld, D.C., Jones, M.A., Totten, J.W., Where is my suitcase?

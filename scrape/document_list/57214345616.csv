It is intended to support and use technologies especially in the field of education for helping teachers to do presentation with ease. The program is developed by using a science field of computer vision, as well as additional libraries which are: FLTK, OpenGL, and OpenCV. In order to use this program, the presenters need to have a webcam and a projector. The webcam will be used to recognize the shape and the pattern of the presenters' hands. Furthermore, the program will send signals to the computers based on the recognized pattern. The result of this research is a program that can improve the teaching process of teaching/presentation. © 2015 The Authors.

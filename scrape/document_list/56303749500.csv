Since fashion is the most favorite item category in Indonesia, there are lots of fashion e-commerce grown in the country. One of the unsatisfactory conditions that are occurred in fashion e-commerce in Indonesia is user drop off. By using funnel analysis, the product detail page of fashion e-commerce founded as the page with the most user drop off. To tackle this problem, several experiments were prepared. With A/B testing, the experiments that possibly improved the conversion rate were identified. This research discovered experimental version of the User Interface (UI) of the product detail page by manipulating button colors, layout, and delivering comprehensible information to users. © 2020 IEEE.","A/B testing; Conversion rate; E-commerce; Funnel analysis; User drop off","Drops; Electronic commerce; Information management; A/b testing; Conversion rates; Indonesia; Item category; Physical stores; Product and services; User interfaces",,,,,,"(2019) Most Purchased Products on 11. 11 Shopping Event Amongst Respondents in Indonesia As of November 2018 by Category, , Statista.com, Statista. com; Maulia, E., (2019) Indonesia Seeks Lead in Global Modest-fashion Industry; Muller, J., (2019) Most Popular E-commerce Sites for Fashion in Indonesia As of 3rd Quarter 2019, by Monthy Web Visits, , Statista.com2; Rahutomo, R., Perbangsa, A.S., Soeparno, H., Pardamean, B., Embedding model design for producing book recommendation (2019) Proc. 2019 Int.

Where, if the KM concept focuses on creating knowledge and innovations sourced from within the organization, the CKM focuses on the consumer's perspective as a trigger for the creation and improvement of innovation. In other words, CKM builds two-way communication between companies and consumers, with the aim of accelerating knowledge creation.

However, what about the food ordering process at the Padang restaurant? The mechanism is still conventional, and of course, it will lead to inefficiency in their dish processing cycle. Often we encounter many Padang dishes unsold in a day. Also, the food is re-heated again, which is very dangerous for health, especially when the food contains coconut milk base. Through the development of bring your own device (BYOD) application, it is expected to improve several processes on food ordering, table reservation, payment, and delivery at Padang food restaurant chains.

The problem is a lack of integrated information system to help the company in finding the successors of vacant positions and in mapping out the employee career path. Several methods were used in this research such as questionnaire and benchmarking with literature review. The questionnaire method consists of 16 questions which were based on Likert scale and literature benchmarking method that compared Evergreen Retirement Community, Boomers, and Brazilian Professionals to SME Sector. As for the information system design, Unified Modeling Language (UML) was utilized to produce use case diagram, sequence diagram, activity diagram, and entity relationship diagram (ERD) to help designing the user interface.

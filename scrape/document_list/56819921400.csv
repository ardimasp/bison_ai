This research constituted a descriptive research. It intended to construct the conceptual model for improving the strategic competitiveness. Conceptually, the logistics service companies should improve competitive advantage (CA), strategic management (SM) and strategic entrepreneurship (SE) to improve strategic competitiveness (SC). Strategic management (SM) and strategic entrepreneurship (SE) had effect on strategic competitiveness (SC) through competitive advantage (CA). The strategic entrepreneurship (SE) could be improved by companies through improving strategic management (SM). Strategic management (SM) enabled had direct effect on strategic competitiveness (SC) and strategic entrepreneurship (SE) had direct effect on strategic competitiveness (SC). The conceptual model and its hypotheses could be a framework for further research. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Competitive advantage; Strategic competitiveness; Strategic entrepreneurship; Strategic management",,,,,,"(2015), (PM 74,) about logistics service business; (2016) Indonesia Transportation and Logistics Industry Continued Economic Growth Momentum Supports Transport Infrastructure Investment and Development; Rothaermel, F.T., (2013) Strategic Management: Concepts and Cases, , McGraw- Hill/Irwin, New York; Barney, J.B., Hesterly, W.S., (2012) Strategic Management and Competitive Advantage: Concepts and Cases, , Fourth edn., Pearson Education, Inc., USA; Dess, G.G., (2014) Strategic Management: Text and Cases, Global Edition, , McGraw-Hill/Irwin, New York; David, F.R., David, F.R., (2015) Strategic Management: Concepts and Cases, , 15th edn., Pearson Education Limited, England; Ireland, R.D., Webb, J.W., Crossing the Great Divide of Strategic Entrepreneurship: Transitioning between Exploration and Exploitation (2009) BUSHOR-763, p. 11; Hitt, M.A., (2015) Strategic Management: Competitiveness and Globalization (Concepts), , 11th edn., South-Western Cengage Learning, USA; Volberda, H.W., (2011) Strategic Management: Competitiveness and Globalization, , Cengage Learning EMEA, United Kingdom; Bris, A., Caballero, J., (2015) Revisiting the Fundamentals of Competitiveness: A Proposal, IMD World Competitiveness Year Book; Foss, N.J., Lyngsie, J., (2011) The Emerging Strategic Entrepreneurship Field: Origins, Key Tenets and Research Gaps, , Working Paper, Copenhagen Business School, Denmark; Daryani, S.M., Tabrizinia, S., (2015) J.

Conceptually, some previous researches showed that the competitiveness could be improved through innovative capabilities and performance improvement. Nevertheless, these researches related only two of the three variables, namely between innovative capabilities and performance, innovative capabilities and competitiveness, and performance and competitiveness. These researches did not explain that the performance can be a mediator (intervening) variable for relationship between innovative capabilities and competitiveness (relationships of three variables). Based on the gap, this research aimed to develop the conceptual model, hypothesis and its dimensions for the future research. By using explanatory research design, a conceptual model of competitiveness improvement, hypothesis, and its dimensions were developed to be verified in the future research.iThe dimensions of the three variables included financial strength, customer value, technology/ skills, shareholder value: (competitiveness); profitability and growth (performance); sensing capability, combination capability,tand relational capability (innovative capabilities). © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

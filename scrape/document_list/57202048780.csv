A central research topic is how to stimulate learning and improve the quality of questions for learning evaluation by generating relevant questions with objective of learning and cognitive skill levels. This study presents an automated question generating method based on keyphrase to improve learning system in such way that the generated questions comply with both predetermined learning outcomes and Bloom's taxonomy of hierarchical cognitive skill levels. Unlike the prominent methods, this study proposed the learning materials written in local languages transformed into English which make the method applicable to learning material written in various languages given the language translation to English is available. In addition, the expert knowledge about keyphrase patterns in this study is represented in a set of context-free grammar rules making it possible to extend the pattern's rules to capture various keyphrase structures. The study which used 1,432 sentences from learning material written in Bahasa Indonesia can generate about 60,000 questions. From the experimentation, the average of Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score which is computed from the generated questions is 0.9566. This result indicates that the generated questions are well understood by human assessors. From sentiment analysis results, the generated questions achieve 0.73 classified as neutral, and 0.68 classified as objective. The Cohen-Kappa coefficient of 0.34589 means there is a difference between human evaluators in understanding the generated questions. © 2020 ICIC International.

The dataset used consisted of 93,000 pairs of questions. Data were trained repeatedly with a percentage of dataset 80:20 and classified using six levels in bloom's taxonomy and based on vector embedding. The results of this study prove that the encoder-decoder model with attention produces better and easier questions than other models. Evaluation of the question-producing system by comparing the two activation functions, namely hyperbolic tangential and sigmoid, shows that the sigmoid function can reduce the value of the loss function to 0.001, which means it can minimize the error factor. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The increasing popularity of online learning in recent years has given momentum to automated question generation in education field for facilitating learning process, learning material retrieval, and computer-based testing. This paper report on the development of question generation framework based on key-phrase method for online learning with a constraint that the generated questions should comply with the learning outcomes and skills from Bloom’s Taxonomy. The proposed method was tested using learning materials of Software Engineering course for undergraduate level written in Bahasa Indonesia obtained from Bina Nusantara’s (Binus’s) Online Learning repository. Using one-semester lecture material, this study generated 92,608 essay-type questions from 6-level Bloom’s Taxonomy which were further sampled randomly to obtain 120 question samples for method evaluation. Performance evaluation using average Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) involving five independent reviewers toward samples of these questions achieved 0.921 and 0.6 Cohen’s Kappa.

Many researchers have conducted studies on the use of recommendation systems in online learning. However, until now, several similar studies still focus on the accuracy of the prediction results. Various obstacles were encountered related to changes in the face to face learning process into online learning. This study uses the User-Item Collaborative Filtering method to predict student learning outcomes as a basis for providing recommendations to students. Data on student online learning outcomes were extracted using several methods as a basis for determining and assessing their learning outcomes. The dataset we use is dummy to match the original data. The findings of this study reveal that one of the reinforcing factors that affect student achievement in online learning is the quiz score. The students' high achievement in the quizzes was also balanced by their active involvement during the learning process. Based on the evaluation of the recommendation system, it is known that the gradient boosted tree model is the best model for predicting the final score of student online learning with an accuracy calculated using the highest correlation of 0.7 and the smallest absolute error of 13.0 and root mean square error of 17.9. Based on the results of the evaluation, this study provides recommendations in the form of material links and learning archives that are useful for students to be able to carry out independent learning. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

With the development of data, the processor can be done with one unit only, over time required computing devices that have high performance. Parallel Computing is one of the techniques of doing computing simultaneously by utilizing several independent computers simultaneously. Parallel computers can be grouped according to the level at which hardware supports parallelism. This classification is generally analogous to the distance between basic computing nodes. This research will focus on looking at the widely used classification trends in this parallelism that affect the performance of these calculations. This study uses a systematic literature review to find many classifications in parallel computing. literature is taken from a reputable journal database is ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Science Direct, Emerald Insight. The results of this study are mostly conducted in the United States and China so as to provide many contributions. classification of parallelism, mostly done in parallel computing include Distributed Parallel, Multi-Core Processor, Massively Parallel Computing, and Graph Processing Unit (GPU).

The SLR method analyzed papers published in the range of 2013-2018. Out of the 109 papers this study analyzed indepth 42 papers. The study findings confirmed that most of RS studies still focused on e-commerce, movies, tourists, and more whose most popular RS methods were collaborative filtering and content base. Some studies in RS for online education were mostly focused on scheduling, recommendations for courses, books, prospective students and others. The results of this study found that there are still much opportunities to develop methods and approaches for RS in online learning.

The level of similarity then we validated using a lecture note. This research is a continuation of the research that we are currently doing related to the development of smart LMS with one of the supporting features of the recommendation system. Using the analysis in the forum log post discussion of this research was carried out through several stages. The first stage, the random selection of 5 classes taken by the forum data, the second stage, carried out text mining analysis from the posts of students and lecturers, the third stage, analyzing text validation using lecture notes that have been used as data sets in the form of corpus. This study uses the doc2v algorithm with vectorization. The results of this study found that the percentage of similarities between lecturers' posts, students and lecture notes only reached 49% of the target we expected at least 80%. Because discussion forums are a substitute for face-to-face sessions on face-to-face learning. On the other hands this study found that the similarity of discussion between lecturers and students on discussion forums had a significant influence on student learning outcomes (assignment) and this reinforces the need for a system of recommendations for online learning. © 2018 IEEE.","Log forum discuss; Online learning; Recommendation system; Smart LMS; Text mining analysis","Data mining; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Online systems; Recommender systems; Students; Degree of similarity; Face-to-face learning; Log forum discuss; Online learning; Random selection; Smart LMS; Student learning outcomes; Text mining analysis; E-learning",,,,,,"Wan, S., Niu, Z., An e-learning recommendation approach based on the self-organization of learning resource (2018) Knowledge-Based Systems, 160, pp. 71-87; Pawar, A., Mago, V., (2018) Calculating the Similarity between Words and Sentences Using a Lexical Database and Corpus Statistics, , arXiv preprint; Medeiros, E.A.S., De Menezes, F.G., Guerra, C.M., Batista, R.E.A., Perdiz, L.B., Angelieri, D.B., E-learning practices on healthcare associated infections (hai): Report of brazilian experience (2008) Am J Infect Dis, 4 (4), pp. 232-236; Jabr, M.A., Al-Omari, H.K., E-learning management system using service oriented architecture (2010) J Comput Sci, 6 (3), pp. 285-295; Hirzallah, N., An authoring tool for as-in-class e-lectures in e-learning systems (2007) Am J Appl Sci, 4 (9), pp. 686-692; Limongelli, C., Lombardi, M., Marani, A., Sciarrone, F., Temperini, M., A recommendation module to help teachers build courses through the moodle learning management system (2016) New Rev Hypermedia Multimed; Alfalah, T.F., Alfalah, S.F., Falah, J.F., Qutaishat, W., Ishretih, W., Al-Zu'bi, M., Learning management system versus social networking sites (2017) Int Bus Res; Naveh, G., Shelef, A., Let the learning management system grow on you-the effect of experience on satisfaction (2018) Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing; Phongphaew, N., Jiamsanguanwong, A., Usability evaluation on learning management system (2018) Adv Intell Syst Comput; Wiley, D.A., The instructional use of learning objects(1) (2002) Bloomington, In: Agency for Instructional Technology; Tohti, T., Zhao, Y., Musajan, W., (2017) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1 (887), pp. 1-7. , Word2vec and Dictionary Based Approach for Uyghur Text Filtering; Hearst, M.A., Text data mining: Issues, techniques, and the relationship to information access (1997) Presentation Notes for Uw/Ms Workshop on Data Mining, , July 1997; Feldman, R., Dagan, I., Knowledge discovery in textual databases (kdt (1995) Proceedings of the First International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (kdd-95), pp. 112-117. , Montreal, Canada, August 20-21, aaai Press; Fayyad, U., Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Smyth, P., From data mining to knowledge discovery: An overview (1996) Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1-36. , U.

With hundred million of Indonesian users exposed to the internet and increasing reliance of corporations with internet technologies have made Indonesian corporations fragile to information theft issues. Nowadays, information theft has become global issues where all corporations and governments around the world have taken necessary measures to secure their essential assets. Along with the government plan to establish internet watchdog body in 2017, the article took the case of cyber-attacks that occurred within period of 2013-early 2017, with the objective to analyze the trends of cyber-attacks in Indonesian corporations. The article is carried out with the consideration that although the internet security issues are important, however, there is still very few articles can be found to illustrate the trend of cyber-attacks in Indonesian corporations, and almost all cases tend to be closed from public exposure. © 2017 IEEE.","Analysing trends of cyber-crimes attacks;

This paper aims to propose an effectiveness and efficiency design of ITSM through capability maturity model integration (CMMI) in an organization to manage IT division. ITSM is affected by the procedure, performance, and capability of IT division. They determine the success level of the Services Level Agreement (SLA) within the organization. Derived from literature studies and interviews from the organization management member and the IT user, the paper argue that the practice of information technology infrastructure library (ITIL) done by CMMI is recommended to improve the IT services to support an organization to meet SLA. © 2017 IEEE.","CMMI; IT Services; ITSM; SLA","Information management; Software engineering; Capability maturity model integration; CMMI; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Information technology infrastructure library (ITIL); Information technology services; IT services; ITSM; Services level agreements; Efficiency",,,,,,"Kumbakara, N., Managed IT services: The role of IT standards (2008) Inf.

The study was based on the lightning data provided by local lightning detection systems and the analysis was conducted by overlaying ground flash map to the map of utility distribution network. The study result shows that GFD based on grid cell size with less magnitude has higher correlation with the outage events level of distribution powerlines. © 2014 IEEE.","distribution powerlines; ground flash density; lightning location system","Renewable energy resources; Grid cell size; Ground flash; Ground flash densities; Lightning datum; Lightning detection; Lightning location systems; Power lines; Utility distributions; Lightning",,,,,,"(2011) IEEE Guide for Improving the Lightning Performance of Electric Power Overhead Distribution Lines, , New York; Kosmac, J., Toros, Z., Evaluation of lightning threat in disibution network (2009) CIRED, , Prague; Diendorfer, G., Ground flash density and lightning exposure of power transmission lines Proc.

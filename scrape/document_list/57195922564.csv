Kebon Jeruk Raya No. 27, Jakarta, Indonesia","Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is an image retrieval method that is based on the meta content of an image which is proven to be more efficient than image retrieval method that is based on text or key words. Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) is a popular approach and the most widely used in CBIR problem. In this research, a CBIR method using BoVW and multiclass SVM classifier will be proposed. In BoVW, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) will be used as the local features descriptor. This research will use Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as the method to do the visual vocabulary generation and Fisher Vector (FV) to create the encoder. The multiclass SVM classifier will use linear kernel, Hellinger’s kernel, and chi-square kernel to do the classification. After the classification, the proposed CBIR will use the classification model to classify query image. After the query image class is known, then the color histogram features will be extracted from query image and dataset which only consists of image in the same class as query image. Datasets used in the research are Corel and Guang-Hai Liu (GHIM-10K). The experimental results show that BoVW with GMM and FV produces higher accuracy than other encoding methods in BoVW which produce a good retrieval result in the CBIR. © 2017.","Bag of visual words; Content based image retrieval; Image classification",,,,,"Binus University","Acknowledgment.

As the development of information technology and the use of data that increasingly large, it will be a main factor that affects to the company's business. The amount of data that must be processed both at headquarters and other branch offices make the process of data exchange become the main issue in term of speed and delay. Due to data exchange being a top priority in the company, often the WAN network bandwidth used by the file system, email system, proxy, web system becomes peak or full during peak hours thus slowing down accessing file or email system. One method to reduce bandwidth usage is almost full is to use WAN Optimization tools. WAN Optimization has several functions, including Data Streamlining, Transport Streamlining, and Application Streamlining. The purpose of this study is to analyze performance network when WAN optimization was applied in the system. Data is taken from simulated file transfers conducted several days and at different hours. Data were analyzed using Wireshark tools and calculation formula. The results can be seen if there is a significant increasing performance, delay become better from 287 ms to 0.604 ms for file size 93 MB and jitter increased 12.4% better. It can be concluded that with the optimization of WAN, the process of data transfer becomes more efficient both in bandwidth and time during working hours. © 2017 The Authors.

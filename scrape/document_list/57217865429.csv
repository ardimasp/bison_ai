Kebon Jeruk Raya No. 27, Kebon Jeruk Jakarta Barat, 11530, Indonesia","Schools, colleges and universities are now embracing the use of visual aid presentation (e.g., PowerPoint) in the classroom. Studies have consistently indicated that students generally believed that the use of technology for oral presentation would facilitate their learning. Students in such condition believed that the class was more organized, clear and interesting. Students also liked the teacher/lecturer more and indicated that they would like to take another class from the teacher/lecturer when the he or she used technology means of presentation. This research was focusing on the perspective of students in Binus University regarding the advantages or disadvantages of this model of learning process in regard of interesting or boring and long or short endurance of understanding. The visual aid presentation here meant that the students were the ones who were performing the presentation, instead of the teacher/lecturer. The research method used was descriptive qualitative based on the survey and interview of some sample students who were chosen randomly, who were taking English course in first/second semester.Based on some researches, the visual aid presentation in learning process was showing positive impact for teachers and students. Therefore, the hypothesis on this research was that the visual aid presentation on learning process would bring an interesting environment, long endurance of understanding and improving students' behavior. It was expected that the result of this research could be used to improve the learning method of English learning in Binus University in order to support Binus Vision to be a global university and to enrich graduates with the skill of oral presentation.The respondents were selected from management students in Binus, Alam Sutera Campus, and randomly chosen. All of the respondents replied that learning by doing presentations was giving more understanding on topics, boosting up self-confident, teaching public speaking, handling nervous and creating a dynamic class environment to avoid boredom. From the students' point of view, this learning method was giving advantage for students and long endurance of understanding. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Learning systems; Technical presentations; Colleges and universities; English Learning; Learning by doing; Learning English; Learning methods; Oral presentations; research methods; Students' behaviors; Students",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement","This work is supported by the Research and Technology Transfer Office (RTTO), a part of Research Grant to Binus Faculty Member.","Alkash, K.A., Al-Dersi, Z.E., Advantages of Using PowerPoint Presentation in EFL Classroom & the (2013) Journal of English Language & Translation Studies, 1; (2015) Rencana Strategis Penelitian Binus University Tahun 2015-2019.; Willyarto, M.N., Chairiyani, R., Pane, M., Mathematics Learning Method of Bar Modeling for Grade 7 Students (2015) Advanced Science Letters, 21 (7), pp. 2328-2331; Benawa, A., Gea, A.A., Willyarto, M.N., Improving Teacher's Commitment by Improving External Factors (2017) Advanced Science Letters, 23 (2), pp. 925-928; Willyarto, M.N., Werhoru, D., Gea, A.A., (2017) International Symposium on Educational Technology.; Apperson, J.M., Laws, E.L., Scepansky, J.A., The impact of presentation graphics on students (2006) Computers and Education, 47 (1), pp. 116-126; Oommen, A., Teaching English as a Global Language in Smart Classrooms with PowerPoint Presentation (2012) English Language Teaching, 5 (12), pp. 54-61; Chou, P.N., Chang, C.C., Lu, P.F., Prezi versus PowerPointL the Effects of Varied Digital Presentation Tools on Students' Learning Performance (2015) Computers and Education, 91, pp. 73-82; Layne, A., Doing Qualitative Community Research: Lesson for Faculty, Students and Community (2014) Pshycology Research, 4; Fraenkel, J.R., Wallen, N.E., (2008) How to Design and Evaluate Research in Education, Seventh Edition.; Yunus, U., Symbols of Cross Cultural Communication in Kasepuhan Palace Indonesia (2017) International Journal of Philosophy of Culture and Axiology, 14 (1), pp. 171-176",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","4th International Conference on Computing and Applied Informatics 2019, ICCAI 2019","26 November 2019 through 27 November 2019",,161570,17426588,,,,"English","J.

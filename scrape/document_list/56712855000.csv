In the series of their papers, several examples are built to explain each stage that occurs. This paper contributes to providing another exemplary, explaining the process of cognition in situated FBS. The dry run analysis is used to explore all the stages that occur in the development, with case examples in designing sustainable architecture. The discussion maps an instance of developing ideas with sustainable aspects that include eight processes from situated FBS. This map focuses on the continuity of the processes and their translation. The continuity of existing operations requires several bridging methods, most of which are formed by constructive memories. In order to increase awareness of sustainable design, basic knowledge, design vocabularies, and design success stories that are collected into constructive memory play a significant role in achieving design requirements. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","design model; design process; designing; situated FBS; sustainable design","Ecodesign; Bridging methods; Constructive memory; Design modeling; Design process; Design success; designing; situated FBS; Sustainable architecture; Sustainable development",,,,,,"Gero, J.S., Kannengiesser, U., The situated function-behaviour-structure framework (2004) Des.

In general, the cooling loads are from internal and external heat. The external heat plays significantly in determining the cooling load; therefore, it is necessary to reduce the amount of solar radiation received by the external surface of the building. The objective of the paper is to investigate the reduction of solar radiation received by the surface of the multi-storey office building by applying parametric design study and to add a building envelope as the secondary skin as well as the architectural element. There are two steps of analysis in the methodology, (1) to conduct solar radiation analysis, and (2) to conduct building facade analysis. In the process, four alternatives form were simulated to obtain the most optimum shape in relation to the incident solar radiation reduction. The final parametric study results of the solar radiation and building facade analysis showed that the reduction of the irradiance is around 25% with the additional facades. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","irradiance reduction; office building; parametric facade","Air conditioning; Cooling; Facades; Office buildings; Architectural element; Building envelopes; Building facades; External surfaces; Irradiance level; Parametric design; Parametric study; Radiation analysis; Incident solar radiation",,,,,,"(2018) Handbook of Energy and Economic, , https://www.esdm.go.id/en/publication/handbook-of-energy-and-economic, Kementrian ESDM (Oktober 2) Retrieved from Kementrian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral Republik Indonesia; (2016) Panduan Penerapan Bangunan Gedung Hijau, , https://greenbuilding.jakarta.go.id, Green Building Jakarta (September 23) Retrieved from Jakarta Green Building; Woodbury, R., (2010) Elements of Parametric Design; Anton, I., Tanase, D., Informed Geometries.

This comes to a result that the identity of a product or a building façade will commonly generate in the same way that the initial design was intended to. Rectifying the early model will then greatly impact the process later. The aim of this paper is to propose a way to solve these two challenges, without risking the manufacturing process, but more to explore the potential designs. Shape grammar is used to conceive more designs in the early stage, derived from the initial product - the modular adaptive façade system. The derivations are then tested through simulation to state the efficacy of the models. We find that the workflow somehow contributes to the better design and engineering process as well as the solution allows diversification in the façade expressions. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","adaptive façade; design tool; energy efficient; shape grammar","Computer aided manufacturing; Energy efficiency; Manufacture; Product design; Design tool; Energy efficient; Engineering process; Initial design; Manufacturing phase; Manufacturing process; Mass production; Shape grammars; Bridges",,,,,,"Bougdah, H., Sharples, S., (2010) Environment, Technology and Sustainability, , (London: Taylor amp; Francis); Perez, R., Ineichen, P., Steals, R., Michalsky, J., Stewart, R., Modeling daylight availability and irradiance components from direct and global irradiance (1990) Solar Energy, 44 (5), pp. 271-289; (2009) Buildings and Climate Change - Summary for Decision Makers, , UNEP, (United Nations Environment Programme); (2008) A National Green Building Reseach Agenda, , USGBC Research Committee, (US Green Building Council); Sjarifudin, F.U., Adaptive Building Envelope System using Parametric Camshaft Mechanism for Energy Efficient Building (2012) Applied Mechanics and Materials, 232, pp. 919-924; Sjarifudin, F.U., Adaptive System Development for Secondary Skin (2014) Applied Mechanics and Material, 534, pp. 125-130; Sjarifudin, F.U., Justina, L., Daylight Adaptive Shading Using Parametric Camshaft Mechanism for SOHO in Jakarta ICASCE 2013 - International Conference on Advances Science and Contemporary, , (Jakarta, 2014); Sjarifudin, F.U., Parametric Camshaft Mechanism for Adaptive Building Envelope and Kinetic Building Ornaments (2014) Key Engineering Material, 572, pp. 225-228. , 6 January; Stiny, G., (2006) Shape: Talking about Seeing and Doing, , (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press); Gips, J., (1999) Computer Implementation of Shape Grammars, Workshop on Shape Computation, , http://www.shapegrammar.org/implement.pdf, [Online]; Duarte, J.P., (2005) ECAADe 21 Digital Design, , (Lisbon) A Discursive Grammar for Customizing Mass Housing; Li, A.I.-K., Liang Chen, Y.W., Editing shapes in a prototype two- and three-dimensional shape grammar environment (2009) Computation: The New Realm of Architectural Design: Proceedings of the 27th Conference on Education and Research in Computer Aided Architectural Design in Europe, , (Istanbul,) H.

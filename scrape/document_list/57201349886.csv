Three distinct yet intertwine aspects such as decentralization, technology, and para diplomacy become antecedent of competitiveness of the city. A city has more power and authority in creating wealth and prosperity of the society by utilizing technology. The smart city, in addition to the importance of technology as enabler, we argue that possessing the sophisticated technology and apply it towards the matter is not enough. The smart city needs to build smart diplomacy at the sub-national level. In this article, we extend the discussion about smart city by proposing a new framework of smart city diplomacy as one way to integrate information technology, public policy and international relations which will be the main contribution to literature and practice. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Public policy; Competitiveness of the cities; International relations; National level; Smart city",,,,,"The authors gratefully acknowledge that the present research is supported by Ministry of Research and Technology and Higher Education Republic of Indonesia under the research grant of Hibah Kompetensi 2017.","Nobuyuki, T., (2016) The Smart City and the Co-creation of Value, , (Japan: Springer); Albino, V., Berardi, U., Dangelico, R.M., Smart cities: Definitions, dimensions, performance, and initiatives (2015) Journal of Urban Technology, 22 (1), pp. 3-21; Mukti, A.T., (2013) Paradiplomacy: Kerjasama Luar Negeri Oleh Pemda di Indonesia, , (Yogyakarta: The Phinisi Press); Detlef, F.S., Yael, W., (2004) Eds.

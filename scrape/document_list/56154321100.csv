The research starts with applying the principles of customer-centric supply chain, outside-in process, and demand-driven network to analyze the key drivers of the sales growth. Multivariate forecasting and ABC classification methods are employed to predict the growth and provide recommendation for the safety stock levels of the 190 SKUs (Stock Keeping Unit) fall in the category A, B, and C. Seven major key drivers are identified. The size of the discount offered is found to be one of the most significant factors, while the people rating does not affect the sales growth. The key drivers in each category are found to be unique and tailoring the sales strategies according to the characteristics of the SKUs in each category is expected to improve their effectiveness. An ergonomic dashboard that applies human factors and user-centered design concepts is also proposed as a means to display critical information that support the store’s demand forecasting and planning strategies © IEOM Society International.","ABC classification; E-commerce; Ergonomic dashboard; Multivariate forecasting; Safety stock",,,,,,"Afolabi, O.

Developing tools and techniques that aim to combat the loss of water quantity becomes a priority action due to it can provide actionable information to the community in its contribution to clean water conservation. In this study, the IoT-based water reduction system has been developed to measure water volume at three household appliances (washing machine, shower, and toilet) by installing flow sensors to those of each pipeline. Each sensor was connected to a microcontroller that sends water volume data and it will be stored in the cloud server. This technology could help users in reducing clean water consumption by: alarming user whenever water volume reaches 75, 85 and 95% of the limit volume for each showering session by installing a buzzer to the shower's pipeline; limiting the water used for the toilet flushing by installing a solenoid valve for the toilets' pipelines; and allowing users to access the information of all water consumption through Android-based mobile application. Through this study, IoT technology has great potential to support clean water reduction strategy due to it could save clean water up to 402 l monthly. Application of IoT technology can be started to be installed in such a small house or apartment in which the user can directly monitor their water consumption. © 2020 WULS - SGGW Press.

Observations and surveys were conducted vis-a-vis 48,013 toll-road users to determine the suitable OBU types and its potential contributions toward efficient tollgate queuing time. Subsequently, it is expected to concurrently determine the appropriate promotion tools that support toll-road users particularly in non-tapping payment system of OBU. House of Quality and V/C Ratio are the basis of the problem formulation in this research. The study shows that a flexible mount OBU device which displays its current available balance are desired by most toll-road users. Moreover, toll-road users expect the single piece microwave OBU device to be waterproof, heatproof, and durable. Comparing to e-card system, its usage reduces the queuing time by 50% to 60%. Additionally, the study shows that collaboration with gas station is the most appropriate promotion model.

In this study, a machine learning technique i.e. support vector machine (SVM) was applied to develop a load level prediction system of friction stir spot welded joint aluminium alloy AA5052-H112. This load level prediction system model was proposed based on three levels of load group of the welded joint. Experimental works in friction stir spot welding was conducted on samples specimens of AA5052-H112 2mm thick overlap joint based on 27 combinations of governed parameters i.e. spindle speed, tool depth, and dwell time. Mechanical testing of tensile shear load was then carried out to those specimens to obtain 27 loads data to form the SVM classifier. These data were required for pattern classification and model development via training and testing the proposed prediction system. The result obtained via training and testing showed the classification of load data produced by the proposed system, matched to the required load level with the 100%. This study proved that the proposed load level prediction system offered a useful tool to predict the load level of friction stir welded joint aluminium alloy AA5052-H112 by using respected parameters without required experiments and tests. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Meanwhile, job autonomy and person-environment fit (P-E fit) have direct and indirect influence on well-being by means of social support and trust. Two hundred and eighteen respondents working in multinational companies were selected to test this hypothetical model. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in Linear Structural Relation (LISREL) software, several assumptions in the model were tested, i.e. how job security affected well-being, how autonomy influenced well-being, and how individual deal with it; how P-E fit directly influenced well-being, and how those who were working in the unfavorable environment could reach their well-being condition. The resulting fit indexes Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) with a value of .031 and CFI with a value of .99 significantly confirmed that the model fits and is reliable to represent the actual situation in multinational oil company and multinational automotive company. It was also generalized Conservation of Resources (COR) theory conducted in collective culture. Ultimately, this study offered theoretical and applicative suggestions as new and constructive contributions in improving the well-being at workplace in collective culture. © IEOM Society International.","Conservation of resources theory; Job autonomy; Job security; P-E fit; Well-being",,,,,,"Al Serkal, M.M., The top 10 most optimistic countries in the world, , https://gulfnewscom/news/uae/society/the-top-10-most-optimistic-countries-in-the-world-1.1994890, Gulf News Society 16 March 2017; Armstrong-Stassen, M., Coping with downsizing: A comparison of executive-level and middle managers (2005) International Journal of Stress Management, 12 (2), pp. 117-141; Artz, B., Kaya, I., The impact of job security on job satisfaction in economic contractions versus expansions (2014) Applied Economics, 46 (24), pp. 2873-2890; Azadeh, A., Ahranjani, P.M., The impact of job security, satisfaction and stress on performance assessment and optimization of generation companies (2014) Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries, 32, pp. 343-348. , November 2014; Benešová, A., Tupa, J., Requirements for education and qualification of people in industri 4.0 (2017) Procedia Manufacturing, 11, pp. 2195-2202; Bond, F.W., Bunce, D., The role of acceptance and job control in mental health, job satisfaction and work performance (2003) Journal of Applied Psychology, 88 (6), pp. 1057-1067; Borton, C., Effing, T.W., Cafarella, P., Social support and social networks in COPD: A scoping review (2015) Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), 12 (6), pp. 690-702; Bowling, N.A., Beehr, T.A., Johnson, A.L., Semmer, N.K., Hendricks, E.A., Webster, H.A., Explaining potential antecedents of workplace social support: Reciprocity or attractiveness?

Two hundred and eighteen responders, working either at an oil company (Chevron Pacific Indonesia) or an automotive company based in Jakarta, were selected to test this hypothetical model. Purposful sampling was used to compile the data needed, which were recorded as scales of wellbeing, social support, trust, autonomy, and P-E fit. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the data. Results showed that the hypothetic model was fit. Unlike in individual culture, an increase of job autonomy in the collective culture could directly decrease wellbeing, and the increase of P-E fit could directly increase well-being. Having social support and trust, however, could enable those who have a high level of job autonomy, and those who have low P-E fit, to reach their well-being. This study generalized the Conservation of Resources theory carried out in collective culture. Further studies are needed for wider-ranging applications of this new model. Innovative technique developments are still recommended to overcome this new model's constraints.","Autonomy; Ergonomics; P-E fit; Social support; Trust; Wellbeing","Conservation; Ergonomics; Exhibitions; Autonomy; P-E fit; Social support; Trust; Wellbeing; Industry",,,,,"McShane, S.L., Von Glinow, M.A., (2005) Organizational Behavior, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Rank, J., Pace, V.L., Frese, M., Three avenues for future research on creativity, innovation, and initiative (2004) Applied Psychology: An International Review, 53, pp. 518-528; Anderson, N., Lievens, F., Van Dam, K., Ryan, A.M., Future perspectives on employee selection: Key directions for future research and practice (2004) Applied Psychology, 53, pp. 487-501; Van Dam, K., Van Den Berg, P.T., Challenges for research in work and organizational psychology (2004) Applied Psychology, 53, pp. 481-486; Statistik, B.P., (2003) Profil Perusahaan Perdagangan Berbadan Hukum Indonesia Tahun 2003, , Badan Pusat Statistik, Indonesia; Cascio, W.F., (2003) Managing Human Resources, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Cropanzano, R., Wright, T.A., A 5-year study of change in the relationship between well-being and job performance (1999) Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice & Research, 51 (4), pp. 252-265; Applegate, L.M., Austin, R.D., Soule, D.L., (2009) Corporate Information Strategy and Management, , McGraw Hill, New York; Grebner, S., Semmer, N.K., Elfering, A., Working conditions and three types of well-being: A longitudinal study with self-report and rating data (2005) Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 10 (1), pp. 31-43; Meir, E.I., Melamed, S., Dinur, C., The benefits of congruence (1995) Career Development Quarterly, 43 (3), pp. 257-266; Munandar, A.S., (2001) Psikologi Industri Dan Organisasi, , Penerbit Universitas Indonesia, Indonesia; Earley, P.C., Gibson, C.B., Taking stock in our progress on individualism-collectivism: 100 years of solidarity and community (1998) Journal of Management, 24, pp. 265-304; Yoo, S.K., The cultural impact on depression expression and attitudes toward seeking proffesional help: A comparative study of Americans and south Koreans (2001) Asia Pacific Education Review, 2, pp. 94-100; Tafarodi, R.W., Lang, J.M., Smith, A.J., Self-esteem and the cultural trade-off: Evidence for the role of individualism-collectivism (1999) Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 30, pp. 620-640; Tafarodi, R.W., Smith, A.J., Individualism-collectivism and depressive sensitivity to life events: The case of Malaysian sojourners (2001) International Journal of Intercultural Relation, 25, pp. 73-88; Hobfoll, S.E., The influence of culture, community and the rested-self in the stress-process: Advancing conversation of resources theory (2001) Journal of Applied Psychology, 50 (3), pp. 337-396; Hobfoll, S.E., Conservation of resources (1989) American Psychologist, 44 (3), pp. 513-524; Hobfoll, S.E., Shirom, A., Conservation of resources theory (2000) Handbook of Organizational Behavior, pp. 57-80. , appears in R.

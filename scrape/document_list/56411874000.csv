The more Software Developers means the more competition in Software Development. Software metric for effort estimation is a strategy to use metrics related to effort estimation in software development becomes necessary to determine the effort required to develop the system and hence determine pricing (in the case of software house). Several methods exist to estimate effort. This research discusses the Use Case Point Method using a Student Desk Portal as the study case. The effort calculated based on Use Case method may differ from the actual case. In this paper, the differences are analyzed, and an adjustment factor is constructed to resolve the differences between the effort estimated by use case point and the actual effort placed in the actual software development. A new criterion is introduced by using data from the actual software development, be used as further adjustment to the effort obtained by using Use Case Point method. This new criteria, the simplicity of project is added to be a part of the environment factor. The result is positive, the effort calculated by Use Case Point for three different application is in accordance with the actual result. © 2019 The Authors.

One of the important role in development is application development which is the main element in the development of technology. Due to this reason, it is required to have an application that would satisfy the criteria of standard qualities without any tolerance towards error and failure during process. This paper focused on the design of indicator that can be used in measuring qualities in application development, with Student Desk Portal at Bina Nusantara University used as case study is accessed by thousands of students each week. For this reason, the quality of the application is extremely important. The designed indicators are applied in the development of 35 modules in the Student Desk Portal application. The result shows that after applying the designed indicators in the application development, the number of bugs and errors found in the implementation drastically reduced from 43% to 23%. © 2018 The Author(s).","Indicator; Quality Software Application; Software Metric; Student Desk Portal","Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Indicators (instruments); Program debugging; Students; Application development; Daily lives; Information technology and communications; Quality software; Quality software development; Software metrices; Study case; Software design",,,,,"Florac, W.A., Software Quality Measurement: A Framework for Counting Problems (1992) Failures and Faults.

How should a settlement area be built in vulnerable city to natural disasters especially an earthquake and tsunami. This study is intended to provide an overview of what factors are considered in development based on disaster mitigation, one of which is through its spatial planning which categorizes zone in the study area. Research begins by understanding the location, character of the disaster that threat the location, mapping and finally producing prioritize spatial plans which response to natural hazard and definetely integrated with the spatial plan in the hierarchy above. The main objective is clearly creating a sustainable settlement area for the community. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","disaster mitigation; spatial planning; sustainable development","Sustainable development; Disaster mitigation; Earthquake and tsunamis; Natural disasters; Natural hazard; Plan-based; Spatial planning; Study areas; Sustainable settlements; Disasters",,,,,"Nugroho, S.H., Sadisun, I.A., Tinjauan Tentang Migitasi Bahaya Tsunami di Pesisir Pantai dan Pulau-pulau Kecil (2015) Oseana, 40, p. 41; Gaffar, E.Z., Pemetaan dan Kajian Bencana Tsunami Daerah Kota Bengkulu (2007) Proseding Seminar Geoteknologi Kontribusi Ilmu Kebumian Dalam Pembangunan Berkelanjuta, p. 31; Purwana, R., (2013) Manajemen Kedaruratan Kesehatan Lingkungan Dalam Kejadian Bencana; Sutanta, H., Rajabifard, A., Bishop, I.D., Integrating Spatial Planning and Disaster Risk Reduction at the Local Level in the Context of Spatially Enabled Government; Greiving, S., Fleischhauer, M., Spatial Planning Response Towards Natural and Technological Hazards (2006) Geological Survei of Finland, pp. 110-123; Ihsan, F., Pramukanto, Q., Perencanaan Lanskap Kota Pariaman Provinsi Sumatera Barat Berbasis Mitigasi Tsunami","Noegroho, N.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: noeginoegroho@binus.ac.id",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The government already gives opportunity to SMEs actors through some regulations, not only from financial access point of view bul also regulations in providing the area to accommodate their activities. Jakarta has build a home industy area developed since 1981 named Pusat Industri Kerajinan Pulogadung (Craft Central Industry Pulogadung). Now, this area has been growing in line with the development of the city. It makes this Industry area surrounded by urban residential areas. This study is the result of a design scenario in one cluster of the CCI Pulogadung complex. This cluster is provided for home industry especially for SMEs leather industry. The design for this industrial cluster is not only must be in accordance with the vision and mission of the goverment but also should be suit with its surrounding environmental context. Therefore, the design is based on Sustainable Urban Neighborhood and the surrounding context that also focus on analyzing aspects : user, movement and land subdivision. The result of the study is expected create integrated industrial area between the whole existing industry area and the new cluster in harmoniously.

Many dams have been built and some are under construction. In line with its existence and function, the existence of dams also faces several problems, one of them is erosion problem which threatens the sustainability of the dam function. Land conversion in upstream and around areas contributes to erosion. Natural landscape around the dam must certainly be maintained into the Greenbelt zone. On the one hand its existence must remain part of the natural landscape but on the other hand it will still function as part of the settlement area. The study is intended to map the greenbelt area that must remain natural and which areas can be utilized. Research begins by identifying physical conditions along the edge of the dam, then analyzing it and combining it with existing land use data, resulting in a map of utilization along the edge of the dam (greenbelt). © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

One of them is the village of Untia in Makassar which keeps the story about relocation history of fishermen's settlement in Makassar city. Initially, this village is very 'friendly' for the fishermen, especially the existence of canals that can be passed by the fishing boat to the front of the each house. However, the sustainability of this fisherman village is threatened by the development of urban functions that are urging towards it. From day to day, this village is segregated with the surrounding area, not only from its function but also from social point of view. This condition will be more severe related to the local government plan to reclaim sea far to the west side, thus threatening the sustainability of fisherman life in this village. How does a fisherman village in an urban area have to survive? The research begins by highlighting the conditions and problems that exist, data was collected by field survey. This data combined with some literatures then analyzed to propose a direction how fisherman's village respond to the surrounding development. Become a Tourism village is a one way for fisherman's village to survive in urban area. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","fisherman village; sustainable community; Sustainable in architecture","Sustainable development; Field surveys; fisherman village; Fishing boats; Local government; Major cities; Makassar cities; Sustainable communities; Urban areas; Rural areas",,,,,"Antariksa, (2015) Pelestarian Arsitektur & Kota Yang Terpadu, , (Jogyakarta: Cahaya Atma Pustaka); Ardiani, Y.M., (2015) Sustainable Architecture, , (Jakarta: Erlangga Press); Hadiwijoyo, S.S., (2012) Perencanaan Pariwisata Perdesaan Berbasis Masyarakat Sebuah Pendekatan Konsep, , (Jogyakarta: Graha Ilmu); Pamungkas, A., Rahmawati, D., (2017) Perencanaan Kawasan Pesisir Terpadu di Indonesia: Teori Dan Praktek, , (Jogyakarta: Teknosain); Watson, D., (2003) Time Saver Standards for Urban Design, , (New York: The McGraw Hill Companies); Sassi, P., (2009) Strategies in Sustainable Architecture, , (New York: The McGraw Hill Companies); Williamson, T., Redford, A., Bennets, H., (2003) Understanding Sustainable Architecture, , (London: Spon Press); Garrido, L.D., (2011) Sustainable Architecture, , (Barcelona: Green in Green); Oliver, P., (2006) Built to Meet Needs, Cultural Issues in Vernakular Architecture, , (Italy: Elsevier)","Noegroho, N.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: noeginoegroho@binus.ac.id","Kasih T.P.","","Institute of Physics Publishing","International Conference on Eco Engineering Development 2017, ICEED 2017","14 November 2017 through 15 November 2017",,133427,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

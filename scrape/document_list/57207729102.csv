The problem in this association, as the job is to give detailed reports to government, investor either domestic or international, and every institutions that need information such as market needs, resource developments, and improvement of construction technologies, is to create queries for every data from tables in MySQL to create reports quickly, efficiently, and automatic. Example of reporting needs are: In what month construction project done at the most within 1 year; Project duration, project cost, and experience at the most for each construction company; or amount of projects based on source of funds (APBN, APBD, LOAN PEMERINTAH, BUMN, or SWASTA) for each construction companies. Recommended solution is using Data Warehouse where it has structured storage and can analyze data with OLAP that has capability to process and visualize data at high speed. To construct the Data Warehouse, the design used Kimball Method so this association company will have capability to generate report according to every instances' needs. © 2018 IEEE.","Data Warehouse; kimball; pentaho; Qlik Sense; report","Construction; Construction industry; Data warehouses; Digital storage; Pattern recognition; Construction companies; Construction projects; Construction services; Construction technologies; kimball; pentaho; Qlik Sense; report; Query processing",,,,,"Pauleen, D.J., Wang, W.Y., Does big data mean big knowledge?

Based on past research, optimized localization method for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to predict position of person or object with high accuracy has not been found yet. Most recent research that have solve Received Signal Strength (RSS) inconsistent value is using fingerprint method. This paper proposed a deep regression machine learning using convolutional neural network (CNN) with regression-based fingerprint model to estimate real position. The model used 5 nearest fingerprints as reference RSS values with their location (x or y) label as inputs to produce output of single value position (x or y), then repeat the process to produce second value of position to create complete coordinate of estimated position. To evaluate the proposed model, a comparison between training data with validation data using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is used. The comparisons are with Multilayer Perceptron model and with the weighted sum method as benchmark. The experiment Gave results of mean distance and 90th percentile distance between proposed model with the benchmark. CNN model achieved accuracies of lower than 330cm at 90th percentile with mean distance lower than 185cm. Weighted sum model achieved accuracies lower than 360cm at 90th percentile with mean distance higher than 185cm, and MLP is in between them. The result demonstrates that the proposed method outperformed the benchmark methods. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.","Convolutional neural network; Fingerprinting; Indoor positioning system; Regression machine learning",,,,,,"Brena, R.F., García-Vázquez, J.P., Galván-Tejada, C.E., Muñoz-Rodriguez, D., Vargas-Rosales, C., Fangmeyer, J., Evolution of indoor positioning technologies: A survey (2017) Journal of Sensors, 2017; Cabarkapa, D., Grujic, I., Pavlovic, P., Comparative analysis of the bluetooth low-energy indoor positioning systems (2015) in 2015 12th International Conference on Telecommunication in Modern Satellite, Cable and Broadcasting Services (TELSIKS); Faragher, R., Harle, R., An analysis of the accuracy of bluetooth low energy for indoor positioning applications (2014) in Proceedings of the 27th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation (ION GNSS+'14); Faragher, R., Harle, R., Location fingerprinting with bluetooth low energy beacons (2015) IEEE journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 33 (11), pp. 2418-2428; Terán, M., Aranda, J., Carrillo, H., Mendez, D., Parra, C., IoT-based system for indoor location using bluetooth low energy (2017) in Communications and Computing (COLCOM), 2017 IEEE Colombian Conference; Topak, F., Pekeriçli, M.K., Tanyer, A.M., Technological Viability Assessment of Bluetooth Low Energy Technology for Indoor Localization (2018) Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering, 32 (5); Contreras, D., Castro, M., de la Torre, D.S., Performance evaluation of bluetooth low energy in indoor positioning systems (2017) Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies, 28 (1); Zhuang, Y., Yang, J., Li, Y., Qi, L., El-Sheimy, N., Smartphone-based indoor localization with bluetooth low energy beacons (2016) Sensors, 16 (5), p. 596; He, S., Chan, S.H.G., Wi-Fi fingerprint-based indoor positioning: Recent advances and comparisons (2016) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 18 (1), pp. 466-490; Yu, F., Jiang, M., Liang, J., Qin, X., Hu, M., Peng, T., Hu, X., 5 G WiFi Signal-Based Indoor Localization System Using Cluster k-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (2014) International journal of distributed sensor networks, 10 (12); Li, C., Qiu, Z., Liu, C., An improved weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm for indoor positioning (2017) Wireless Personal Communications, 96 (2), pp. 2239-2251; Tuncer, S., Tuncer, T., Indoor localization with bluetooth technology using artificial neural networks (2015) in Intelligent Engineering Systems (INES), 2015 IEEE 19th International Conference; Xu, H., Wu, M., Li, P., Zhu, F., Wang, R., An RFID Indoor Positioning Algorithm Based on Support Vector Regression (2018) Sensors, 18 (5), p. 1504; Deng, L., Yu, D., Deep learning: methods and applications (2014) Foundations and Trends® in Signal Processing, 7 (3-4), pp. 197-387; Townsend, K., Cufí, C., Davidson, R., (2014) Getting started with Bluetooth low energy: tools and techniques for low-power networking, , O'Reilly Media, Inc; Goodfellow, I., Bengio, Y., Courville, A., Bengio, Y., (2016) Deep learning, 1. , Cambridge: MIT press; Goodfellow, I.J., Warde-Farley, D., Mirza, M., Courville, A., Bengio, Y., Maxout networks (2013), arXiv preprint; Hoo-Chang, S., Roth, H.R., Gao, M., Lu, L., Xu, Z., Nogues, I., Yao, J., Summers, R.M., Deep convolutional neural networks for computer-aided detection: CNN architectures, dataset characteristics and transfer learning (2016) IEEE transactions on medical imaging, 35 (5), p. 1285; Chai, T., Draxler, R.R., Root mean square error (RMSE) or mean absolute error (MAE)?-Arguments against avoiding RMSE in the literature (2014) Geoscientific model development, 7 (3), pp. 1247-1250; Tishby, N., Zaslavsky, N., Deep learning and the information bottleneck principle (2015) in 2015 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW), , Jerusalem; Wang, Y., Yang, Q., Zhang, G., Zhang, P., Indoor positioning system using Euclidean distance correction algorithm with bluetooth low energy beacon (2016) in 2016 International Conference on Internet of Things and Applications (IOTA), , Pune; Nakai, W., Kawahama, Y., Katsuma, R., Reducing error of positioning based on unstable rssi of short range communication (2018) in 2018 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA), , Krakow; Liu, C., Fang, D., Yang, Z., Jiang, H., Chen, X., Wang, W., Xing, T., Cai, L., RSS distribution-based passive localization and its application in sensor networks (2015) IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 15 (4), pp. 2883-2895",,,,"Science and Information Organization",,,,,2158107X,,,,"English","Intl.

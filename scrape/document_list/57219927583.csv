The phenomenon of the development of peer-to-peer lending fintech companies in Indonesia is supported by the increasing demand of consumers. The research objective is to provide insight into the determinants of consumer interest in using fintech applications, using the technology acceptance model by added e-trust variables . The data analysis method used structural equation modeling with WarpPLS 6.0 software. Questionnaires were distributed to fintech consumers in Indonesia, with a total sample of 379 respondents. The results of this study indicate that the dimensions of e-trust contribute to determining the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude to adopt peer-to-peer lending fintech services, and intention to use peer-to-peer lending applications. © 2020.

Many of the current technologies go in the direction of automotive driver assistance features. However, many of the driver assistance features still require physical movement by human to enable the features. In this work, the proposed method is used in order to make certain feature to be functioning without any physical movement, instead human just need to think about it in their mind. In this work, brain signal is recorded and processed in order to be used as input to the recognition system. Right-Left sign lamp based on the brain signal recognition system can potentially replace the button or switch of the specific device in order to make the lamp work. The system then will decide whether the signal is 'Right' or 'Left'. The decision of the Right-Left side of brain signal recognition will be sent to a processing board in order to activate the automotive relay, which will be used to activate the sign lamp. Furthermore, the intelligent system approach is used to develop authorized model based on the brain signal. Particularly Support Vector Machines (SVMs)-based classification system is used in the proposed system to recognize the Left-Right of the brain signal. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent Automatic brain signal-based Right-Left sign lamp access control system. The signal is processed by Linear Prediction Coefficient (LPC) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and the resulting experiment shows the training and testing accuracy of 100% and 80%, respectively. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","brain signal; human factor; Linear Prediction Coding (LPC); Support Vector Machines (SVMs)","Access control; Automobile drivers; Human engineering; Intelligent systems; Signal processing; Speech recognition; Automotive technology; Brain signals; Classification system; Linear prediction coding; Linear prediction coefficients; Recognition systems; Support vector machine (SVMs); Training and testing; Support vector machines",,,,,"9 innovative new car technologies unveiled at CES 2017 (2017) Men's Journal, , http://www.mensjournal.com/gear/collections/9-innovative-new-car-technologies-unveiled-at-ces-2017-w458917/mercedes-benz-w458926, Jim Shi.

As a starting point, in this research a mobile robot, which can run between two road lines using a camera is designed. To detect the road lines in the image from the camera, Edge Detection and Line Detection method is used. The kernel used in the Edge Detection method is the Sobel kernel. The Line Detection is done by finding the coordinates of the maximum value for each column in the Edge Detection's image result. The intersection of two lines will show a certain direction of the robot to correct its direction of movement. Both methods are implemented on a wheeled mobile robot that is controlled by a microcontroller. The robot can detect the miniature road lines and correct its direction of movement so that it can run between the two road lines in parallel with the lines. © 2011 IEEE.","Automatic control; Edge Detection; Line Detection; Microcontroller; Sobel kernel","Autonomous Mobile Robot; Edge detection methods; Line detection; Maximum values; Sobel kernel; Two-line; Wheeled mobile robot; Automation; Biomedical engineering; Cameras; Communication; Control; Edge detection; Highway accidents; Highway traffic control; Information technology; Microcontrollers; Mobile robots; Roads and streets; Transportation",,,,,"Vermaas, L.L.G., Honório, L.M., Jesus, E.O., Freire, M., Barbosa, D.A., Intelligent Vehicle Survey and Applications (2009) Advances in Technological Applications of Logical and Intelligent Systems, pp. 205-235. , IOS Press; Gonzales, R.C., Richard, E., (1993) Digital Image Processing, , USA:Addison Wesley Publishing Company; Sandler, B., (1991) Robotics:Designing the Mechanisms for Automated Machinery, , Engelwood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, Inc; Chapman, S.J., (2008) Matlab Programming for Engineers, , 4 Edition, Canada: Thomson Learning; Marr, D., Hildreth, E., Theory of edge detection (1980) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London - Biological Sciences, 207 (1167), pp. 187-217; Childs, J.S., (2008) C++ Classes and Data Structure, , Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, Inc; Fairhorse, M.G., (1998) Computer Vision for Robotic System, , Prentice Hall; Oram, A., Steve, T., (1991) Managing Projects with Make, , California: O'Reilly&Associates,Sebastopol; Philips, D., (1994) Image Processing in C, , Kansas: R&D Publications,Inc; Purdum, J., (1983) CProgramming Guide, , Indiana: Que Corp; Teuber, J., (1993) Digital Image Processing, , Herfordshire: Prentice Hall; Umbaugh, S.E., (1998) Computer Vision and Image Processing, , Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall","Marcellino, B.A.; Electrical Engineering, , Tangerang, 15811, Indonesia; email: brandonxhunter@yahoo.co.id",,"Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences;School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics;Faculty of Industrial Technology;Faculty of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering of ITB;IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS)",,"International Conference on Instrumentation, Communication, Information Technology and Biomedical Engineering 2011, ICICI-BME 2011","8 November 2011 through 9 November 2011","Bandung",88115,,9781457711657,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

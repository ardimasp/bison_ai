The need for a new culinary center that can become a new communal space for urban communities requires a design approach that supports the creation of sustainable architectural designs in terms of social aspects. The application of the concept of threshold space is done through qualitative design methods in designing culinary centers in Palmerah - Central Jakarta that provide and sell food and drinks. The design of this culinary center is expected to become a new communal space that functions as a recreational space and a space for social interaction that functions well. Threshold space concept was chosen to be applied in the design because it functions as a transition space that connects one function to another, so that integration between spaces is also well created. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","culinary center; social interaction; threshold space","Beverages; Economic and social effects; Social aspects; Communal space; culinary center; Design approaches; Design method; Social interactions; Sustainable architectural design; threshold space; Urban community; Architectural design",,,,,"Pusat Statistik, B., (2019) Jakarta Dalam Angka; Boettger, T., (2014) Threshold Spaces: Transitions in Architecture, Analysis and Design Tools; Katrigis, C., Thomas, C., (2014) Design and Equipment for Restaurant and Foodservice: A Management View, Third Edition; Nio, S., Dewi, J., (2017) Threshold Space Sebagai Pendekatan Desain Ruang Terbuka di Kawasan Kota Tua Jakarta Prosiding Seminar Heritage IPLB, , https://seminar.iplbi.or.id/; Pribadi, H.G., Potensi Wisata Kuliner Kota Muntilan (2018) Jurnal Arsitektur KOMPOSISI, 12 (1), p. 15; Putri, T.L., Irfandi, N., Analisis Pengaruh Daya Tarik Wisata Kuliner Malam (WKM) terhadap Kunjungan Wisatawan di Kota Pekanbaru (2018) Ikraith Ekonomika, 2, pp. 135-137; Signh, R., (2015) Understanding Transition Space","Nurdiani, N.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: nnurdiani@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

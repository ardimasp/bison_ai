The purpose of this research is to evaluate the quality of HIS in a private multi-specialty hospital in Indonesia as the mean to recommend possible actions for the management and IT department in the effort of achieving continuous improvements. The approach involves integrating SERVQUAL method, Kano Model and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) for measuring HIS quality attributes that are adopted from DeLone & McLean IS Success Model dimensions from the users' perspective. This research shows the low user satisfaction level towards the current HIS quality, and then the attributes required for betterment are subsequently identified. As the final outcome, the House of Quality is successfully constructed in order to propose systematic and measured improvement priorities that the hospital should perform to fulfill the users' needs and desires of a high quality HIS. © 2016 IEEE.","continuous improvement; hospital information system; IS Success Model; quality function deployment","Information management; Information systems; Quality function deployment; Continuous improvements; Healthcare institutions; Hospital information systems; House of Quality; IS success model; Quality attributes; Quality function deployments (QFD); User satisfaction levels; Hospitals",,,,,"Chatzoglou, P.D., Fragidis, L.L., Doumpa, T., Aggelidis, P., Hospital information system evaluation (2012) 10th International Conference on ICT in Health, 14, pp. 240-257. , Samos Island, Greek; Chaudhry, B., Wang, J., Wu, S., Maglione, M., Mojica, W., Roth, E., Morton, S.C., Shekelle, P.G., Systematic review: Impact of health information technology on quality, efficiency, and costs of medical care (2006) Annals of Internal Medicine, 144 (10), pp. 742-752; Haux, R., Winter, A., Ammenwerth, E., Brigl, B., (2013) Strategic Information Management in Hospitals: An Introduction to Hospital Information Systems, , New York: Springer-Verlag; Aggelidis, V.P., Chatzoglou, P.D., Methods for evaluating hospital information systems: A literature review (2008) EuroMed Journal of Business, 3 (1), pp. 99-118; Rahimi, B., Vimarlund, V., Methods to evaluate health information systems in healthcare settings: A literature review (2007) Journal of Medical Systems, 31 (5), pp. 397-432; Ribière, V., LaSalle, A.J., Khorramshahgol, R., Gousty, Y., Hospital information systems quality: A customer satisfaction assessment tool (1999) Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Science, pp. 7-16. , Hawaii.

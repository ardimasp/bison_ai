A dataset with a total of 1632 images from sixteen faces with various poses and angles was trained by using two popular existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures: VGG-19, and Google’s Inception V3 using Caffe deep learning framework. The models then were converted to a light CNN model (i.e., CoreML Model) by using CoreMLTools and Python. The converted models were implemented to an iOS-based application developed using Swift and CoreML SDK. The results show that both models resulted in an accuracy score of 93.2% and 93.3% for VGG-19 and Google’s Inception V3 architectures respectively. The average accuracy score achieved by VGG-19 was 78.7% and Google’s Inception V3 was 78.8%. There is no statistically significant difference between model trained by VGG-19 and Google’s Inception V3 architecture. This almost certainly happened due to the fact that the number of images in the dataset is not significantly large enough to give a significant difference between those two architectures. © 2019, ICIC International.

Some renowned techniques such as local-invariant feature extractors (e.g. Scale-invariant feature transform SIFT, Speeded Up Robust Features SURF), as well as Visual BoW approach were used in place classification problems. Nowadays, deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have the advantages towards computer vision problems including place classification problem. Albeit, there are several renowned datasets existed to help the community to learn the models, there is no publicly exists in places dataset for specifically places in Indonesia. This paper presents methodology to collect data of visual places in Indonesia, learn deep features from the data, and classify visual places in Indonesia. We aims to contribute a large dataset as well as deep learning models of places in Indonesian. There are more than 16K images collected and augmented to build the places (specifically places in Indonesia) dataset. The highest accuracy score achieved by the models is 92%. © 2019 The Authors.

There are still quite a number of problems existed in order to build a human-like chatbot program. Understanding a natural conversation and replying back to the conversation the interlocutors, keeping the conversation flowing naturally is a cumbersome task for a computer. This research aims to design an emotionally realistic chatbot system to enhance the believability of the chatbot using Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) and Information State. The results show that there is a statistically significant improvement to the chatbot believability in the system that has emotions variables induced compare to the one without emotions.

Every year, the number of mobile application is increased. It is important for mobile application project owners to calculate the required resources before building a mobile application. In software metric, Use Case Points method is able to count software size of mobile application based on their functionality. This method utilizes use case diagram as their computation factors in the estimation process. Moreover, two other complexity factors are also considered in this method, which are: Technical Complexity Factor and Environment Factor. In this paper, we present software size calculation of QuestDone Mobile Application using 7 steps use case points method. QuestDone has been implemented, but we do not know its software size (i.e. how big the software, how much it cost, how many people is needed). As the result from use case points method, the Use Case Points value of QuestDone is 126.88 with Effort Estimation equal to 889 hours. The software size estimation process of QuestDone Mobile Application detailed in this paper can give an insight to project owners to count software size of other similar projects. © 2017 IEEE.","mobile application; software metrics; software size; use case points","Artificial intelligence; Mobile computing; Environment factors; Estimation process; Mobile applications; Software metrics; Software size; Software size estimation; Technical complexity; Use case points; Application programs",,,,,,"Costello, S., How Many Apps Are in the App Store?""

The purpose of presentation is to demonstrate or introduce presenters' idea to the attendees. Within the given time and specific place, presenters must transfer their knowledge and leave great impression for their audience. Generally, presenters use several handy tools such as mouse, presenter, and webcam to help them to navigate their slides. Nevertheless, some of these tools have several constraints and limitations such as not portable and does not support multimedia. In this research, we develop an application that assist presenters to control their presentation materials by using Microsoft KINECT. In this research, we manipulate colour image, image depth, and the skeleton of the presenters captured by the KINECT. Then, we show the post-process image results into the projector screen. The KINECT has more useful than other tools because it supports video and audio recording. Moreover, it also able to capture presenters' movement that can be used as an input to interact and manipulate the content (i.e. by touching the projection wall). Not only this application provides an alternative in controlling presentation activity, but it also makes the presentation more efficient and attractive. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Colour image; Handy tools; Image depth; It supports; Microsoft kinect; Post process; Physics",,,,,,"Nejem, K.M., Muhanna, W., The Effect of Using Smart Board on Mathematics Achievement and Retention of Seventh Grade Students Int.

In general, there are two types of people: the prior one is people that are afraid of height and the latter one is people who really cannot handle high places (i.e. acrophobia). The purpose of this research is to reduce acrophobia level of people. The methodology which is used in this research is experiment with the help of virtual reality to simulate virtual world of high places environment as the reality in the imagination of the user. The virtual environment helps the sufferer to reduce their fear of height in a safe and controllable environment. This research shows that virtual reality is able to mimic real high places and train the users to overcome their anxiety of high places.

This trend is making people do activities on their smartphone such as exchange information, playing games, paying bills, discussing ideas, etc. In almost every smartphone, security features (i.e. password, pin, face unlock) are already built in which are intended to protect the data inside the smartphone. Nevertheless, those security features are not perfect and have flaws either technically or by human errors. This research aim to provide an application that uses people' facial expressions to improve the security of smartphone, namely Android. We implement face detection and expression recognition in this application as an improvement from the existing unlock screen, which is face unlock. The results that are achieved from this research is an unlock screen application on Android devices that utilizes people' facial expression changes to open their smartphone. This application can eliminates the technical errors from existing face unlock screen application which can be deceived by photos. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.","Biometric; Face expression recognition; Unlock screen","Android (operating system); Biometrics; Face recognition; Manufacture; Security systems; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Android smartphone; Application design; Expression recognition; Face expression recognition; Face expressions; Facial Expressions; Security features; Technical errors; Mobile security",,,,,,"Ahmad, F., Najam, A., Ahmed, Z., Image-based Face detection and recognition: ""state of the art (2012) IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, 9 (6), pp. 169-172. , no. 1; Dashore, G., Raj, V.C., An efficient method for face recognition using principal component analysis (2012) International Journal of Advanced Technnology & Engineering Research, II, 2, pp. 23-28; Saudagare, P.V., Chaudhari, D.S., Facial expression recognition using neural network-An overview (2012) International Journal of Soft Computing and Engineering (IJSCE), 2 (1), pp. 224-227; Baggio, D.L., (2012) Mastering OpenCV with Practical Computer Vision Projects, , Packt Publishing; Jiang, B., Valstar, M.F., Martinez, B., Pantic, M., A dynamic appearance descriptor approach to facial actions temporal modelling (2014) IEEE Transactions of Systems, Man and Cybernetics-Part B, 44 (2), pp. 161-174. , 2011 and; Tan, X., Triggs, B., Enhanced local texture feature sets for face recognition under difficult lighting conditions (2010) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 19, pp. 1635-1650; Valstar, M.F., Pantic, M., Fully automatic recognition of the temporal phases of facial actions (2012) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, 42 (1), pp. 28-43; Jiang, B., Valstar, M.F., Pantic, M., Action Unit detection using sparse appearance descriptors in space-time video volumes (2011) IEEE int'L.

Moreover, when the players play a stage that is ridiculously hard or way too easy, they would probably quit the game because it ismoderately frustrating or boring. The purpose of this research is to createa game that can adapt to the players' ability so the difficulty of the game becomes dynamic. In other words, the game will have different difficultiesof levels according to the players' ability. High difficulty levels will be set if the players use good strategy and low difficulty levels will be set if the players use bad strategy. In this work, we determine the difficulties based on players' lives, enemies' health, and passive skills (skill points) that are chosen by the player. With three of these factors, players will have varies experience of playing tower defence because different combination will give different results to the system and difficulties of the games will be different for each gameplay. The result of this research is a dynamic difficulty tower defence game, dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) document, and gameplay outputs for best, average, and worst strategy cases. © 2015 The Authors.

However, querying this information using traditional keyword based approaches requires often a time-consuming, iterative process to explore the document collection to find the information of interest. Therefore, a structured representation of information and queries would be helpful to be able to directly query for the relevant information. An important challenge in this context is the extraction of structured information from unstructured knowledge bases which is addressed by Information Extraction (IE) systems. However, these systems struggle with the complexity of natural language and produce frequently unsatisfying results. In addition to the plain natural language text,Wikipedia contains links between documents which directly link a term of one document to another document. In our approach for fact extraction fromWikipedia, we consider these links as an important indicator for the relevance of the linked information. Thus, our proposed system FactRunner focusses on extracting structured information from sentences containing such links. We show that a natural language parser combined with Wikipedia markup can be exploited for extracting facts in form of triple statements with a high accuracy.

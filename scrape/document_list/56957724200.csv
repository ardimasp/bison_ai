Based on the vision of the Global Maritime Fulcrum (GMF) of Indonesia, BRI is in line with national interests in the vision of GMF. BRI is related to three of the five pillars contained in the GMF vision, namely maritime connectivity, maritime economy, and maritime culture. This article discusses Indonesia's perceptions and strategies in the BRI framework, and how Indonesia and China balance each other so that cooperation between the two countries impacts on economic growth and prosperity for Indonesia. Finally, for the Global Maritime Fulcrum-Belt and Road Initiatives (GMF-BRI) to synergize and achieve the vision set by the governments of China and Indonesia, mutual economic cooperation is needed. President Joko Widodo has demonstrated his leadership and ability to navigate Indonesia by implementing a hedging strategy with a sense of balance rather than joining in with China via bandwagoning. He showed his firmness in inviting foreign investors, especially from China, but he has strong principles in maintaining the sovereignty and dignity of this country. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","BRI; GMF; Indonesia; Joko Widodo; Strategy",,,,,,,"Adisasmita, H.R., (2013) Pembangunan Ekonomi Maritim, , Graha Ilmu; (2019), http://www.bin.go.id/internasional/detil/489/5/07/08/2019/era-baru-kebijakan-one-belt-one-road, Era Baru Kebijakan One Belt One Road; Cai, K.G., The One Belt One Road and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank: Beijing’s new strategy of geo-economics and geopolitics (2018) Journal of Contemporary China, 27 (114), pp. 831-847; (2020), https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/indonesia-china-natuna-islands-dispute-south-china-sea-12237456, Indonesia deploys four additional warships to Natuna amid standoff with Chinese vessel; (2019), http://en.brnn.com/n3/2019/0829/c415427-9610432.html, Indonesian Ambassador: BRI is open and inclusive; (2020), https://www.cnnindonesia.com/ekonomi/20200129203622-92-469956/salip-jepang-investasi-china-di-ri-naik-dobel-jadi-rp64-t, Salib Jepang Investasi China diri naik dobel jadi Rp 64/t; https://www.cnnindonesia.com/ekonomi/20200217185155-92-475473/virus-corona-belum-goyang-investasi-china-ke-indonesia, Virus Corona Belum Goyang Investasi China ke Indonesia; Dahuri, R., (2017) Menuju Indonesia Sebagai Poros Maritim Dunia, , Roda Bahari; Damuri, Y.R., (2014), https://www.csis.or.id/uploads/attachments/post/2019/01/10/a_maritime_silk_road_and_indonesia_s_perspective_of_maritime_state.pdf, A Maritime Silk Road and Indonesia’s Perspective of Maritime State.

This paper discusses the design of the Flipped Classroom learning model in the Introduction to Chinese Business course, by utilizing various internet-based platforms commonly used by Chinese Department students at BINUS University. The researcher implemented this learning model for 4 weeks and was evaluated by students who took the course with questionnaire and interview methods. The researcher concludes that Flipped Classroom can stimulate student enthusiasm for learning, enhance students self-learning abilities, and increase interaction between teacher to student and student to student in order to achieve optimal learning outcome of the course. In addition, Flipped Classroom can also be an alternative learning model that is transitional, from conventional learning to internet-based learning. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Curricula; E-learning; Education computing; Engineering education; Industrial research; Learning systems; Surveys; Business course; Classroom learning; Design and implementations; Higher education; Internet based learning; Learning models; Learning outcome; Self-learning ability; Students",,,,,,"Ying, Y., Mursitama, T.N., Novianti, N., (2018) Pertanika J.

The availability of the Mandarin language platform as the largest foreign language after English has also become more diverse, starting with free modules available on the web/blog, as well as online course learning models. This paper collects various kinds of Mandarin language learning platforms in Indonesia, researchers qualify their types into several sections: web content based, mobile app based, video streaming based and e-learning courses-based learning platforms. This paper compares the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of each type of Chinese e-learning platform. The results of this study indicate that the challenges of the Mandarin language learning platform in Indonesia will have to prioritize functional, structural, varied and content management aspects, with the expectation of creating a massive, open and integrated learning management ecosystem. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Curricula; Engineering education; Learning systems; Content management; E-learning course; E-learning platforms; Foreign language; Integrated learning management; Language learning; Learning models; Learning platform; E-learning",,,,,,"Ying, Y., Mursitama, T.N., Novianti, N., (2018) Pertanika J.

The study is based on interviews with twenty people of the older and twenty people of the younger generation of Chinese descent in Glodok Chinatown in Jakarta. The interviews reveal that the dominant factor that influences the views of the older generation is their life's experience with this tradition, whereas for the younger generation the existence of the tradition within the family is dominant. The dominant factor that causes respondents to not believe in this tradition is their religious belief. The study also reveals that a lack of understanding of the background and history of selecting auspicious dates in the Chinese community is a major cause for the older as well as the younger generation to be reluctant to transmit this tradition to the next generation. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2020","Auspicious dates selection; Chinese descendants; Generational differences; Glodok Chinatown",,,,,,,"Aslaksen, H., (2000) The Mathematics of the Chinese Calendar, pp. 1-40. , http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.30.6947&rep=rep1&type=pdf, Working paper, National University of Singapore Retrieved from Accessed July, 4, 2020; (2012) Celebrate Chinese Culture: Chinese Auspicious Culture, , Singapore: Asiapac Books pte ltd under authority of Beijing Foreign Language Press; Dawis, A., (2010) Orang Indonesia Tionghoa Mencari Identitas [The Chinese of Indonesia and Their Search for Identity: The Relationship between Collective Memory and the Media], , Jakarta: PT Gramedia Pustaka Utama; Karmadi, A.D., (2014) Budaya Lokal Sebagai Warisan Budaya Dan Upaya Pelestariannya [Local Culture as Cultural Heritage and Preservation Efforts], , https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbyogyakarta/budaya-lokal-sebagaiwarisan-budaya-dan-upaya-pelestariannya/, Retrieved from Accessed July 4, 2020; Shaolin, L., (2015) Folk Culture in China: Choosing Auspicious Dates, , 李 少 林.

For this reason, the growth of Chinese language learners, especially in universities, also increases from time to time. Given that Chinese is a language that is difficult to learn, it is not enough to only face-to-face lessons in class, so that a tool is needed that can help students learn independently in a comfortable place and time. This research begins with a survey of what students need to face obstacles in learning Mandarin vocabulary and the applications needed to support their learning. From the results of the survey on 37 students who studied Mandarin for 4 months, the researchers designed learning applications based on the needs of students. The material from the application is taken from the subject matter in the textbook. Listening lessons are considered difficult by 83.49% of students because of vocabulary. As many as 73.38% of students consider the need for an application that helps vocabulary learning and as many as 83.78% of students need an application on a smartphone that can be used offline. From the student input, an application called ""Smart Word"" was designed. For the next research, the researcher suggestion is that the ""Smart Word"" application can be used to measure the results of student studies. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Students; Surveys; Chinese investors; Chinese language; Face to face; Indonesia; Offline; Student studies; Subject matters; Vocabulary learning; Engineering education",,,,,,"Wang, F., Chen, X., Fang, W., Integrating cell phones into a Chinese high school EFL classroom: Students' attitudes, technological readiness, and perceived learning (2011) Journal .Of Education Technology Development and Exchange, 4 (1), pp. 91-102; Zhang, H., Song, W., Burston, J., Reexamining the effectiveness of vocabulary learning via mobile phones (2011) Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology, 10, pp. 203-204; Tai, Y., Contextualizing a MALL: Practice design and evaluation (2012) Educational Technology. & Society, 15, pp. 220-230; Wu, T., Sung, T., Huang, Y., Yang, C., Yang, J.-C., Ubiquitous English learning system with dynamic personalized guidance of learning portfolio (2011) Educational Technology & Society, 14, pp. 164-180; Yang, T.-Y., Chen, H.-J., Colpaert, J., Aerts, A., Wu, Y.-C., Chao, J., Investigating the effects of a mobile game on EFL learners' vocabulary learning (2012) The Medium Matters: Proceedings 15th International CALL Conference, 23 (3), pp. 697-700; Nah, K.-C., The use of the internet through mobile phones for EFL listening activities (2010) Proceedings Applied Linguistics Association of Korea 2010 Annual Conference, pp. 197-205; Nah, K.-C., Optimising the use of wireless application protocol (WAP) sites for listening activities in a Korean English as a foreign language (EFL) context (2011) Computer.

The ability of graduates can be seen from the results of treasure studies and the soft skills needed can be mapped. So far, the curriculum, and graduate competencies focus more on hard skills even though soft skills are also needed in doing a job. Therefore, this research was conducted to map the soft skills needed to do a job. Data collection was carried out from the input of 99 Chinese Literature graduates spread across three universities that have Chinese Literature study programs. From the input of the graduates, communication skills and teamwork are more needed in doing a job. Thus, policy makers are expected to consider a soft skill course that is beneficial for students in doing a job. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Students; Chinese literature; Communication skills; Data collection; Indonesia; Policy makers; Soft skills; Engineering education",,,,,,"Ying, Y., Rusman, Ali, M., Evaluation of curriculum impact to Students internship: A case study in Chinese Department of Bina nusantara university, Indonesia (2018) ACM int'L.

In order to make the quality of Chinese Indonesian Literature graduates to be in accordance with the needs of the workforce, a study of the relevance of the hard skills ability of Chinese Literature graduates to the needs of the workforce needs to be done. This research focuses on the ability of hard skills needed to work as managers, translators, administrators and trainers. This research uses quantitative methods by distributing questionnaires to graduates of Chinese literature who work in the Chinese community. The results of the study of the ability of hard skills can be used to evaluate the curriculum of the Chinese Literature Study Program in Indonesia. Through curriculum evaluation, it is expected that the organizers of the Chinese Literature Study Program in Indonesia will be able to offer the courses needed to improve the competence of Chinese Literature graduates. From the results of this study, the ability of hard skills of Chinese Literature graduates is only quite relevant to the needs of the workforce. To reach a highly relevant level, several cross-science programs are needed to improve their cross-cultural management and communication skills. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Curricula; Engineering research; Personnel; Surveys; Chinese companies; Chinese literature; Communication skills; Cross-cultural management; Curriculum evaluation; Quantitative method; Research focus; Science programs; Engineering education",,,,,,"Cakir, I., (2006) Developing Cultural Awareness in Foreign Language Teaching, , http://www.tojde.anadolu.edu.tr/tojde23/pdf/article_12.pdf; Evenson, R., Soft Skills, hard sell [Electronic version] (1999) Techniques: Making Education & Career Connections, 74, pp. 29-31; Clarke, W.M., The use of foreign languages by Irish exporters (2000) European Journal of Marketing, 34, pp. 80-90; Itani, S., Järlström, M., Piekkaria, R., The meaning of language skills for career mobility in the new career landscape (2015) Journal of World Business, 50 (2), pp. 368-378; Ying, Y., Rusman, Ali, M., Evaluation of Curriculum Impact to Students Internship: A Case Study in Chinese Department of Bina Nusantara University, Indonesia (2018) ACM International Conference.

For Chinese learners, Indonesian affixes are difficult to understand because the addition of affixes to basic words can change the meaning of words and types of words. In addition, affixes in Indonesian also experience what is called sound fusion in affix letters and basic words. From the survey, respondents are not familiar with the prefixes of me-, ber-, di-, se-, ke-, per-, the suffix of-i, and the confix ke-an, per-an, se-nya. Therefore, at the time of prefix teaching, it should be stated that the sound fusion in prefix of me-will occur if the initial letter of the basic word has the sound of /a/,/e/,/g/,/h/,/i/,/u/,/o/,/k/. When explaining the prefix di-, the learners need to be shown a comparison form and meaning with the preposition di, so that the learner understands the different uses. As for learning prefixes and other confixes, the learners need to be provided with various examples and sentence exercises so that they are accustomed to the sound fusión in prefixes and types of words changes that are formed with the addition of the affix. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Surveys; Chinese students; Indonesian languages; Engineering education",,,,,,"Sobarna, C., (2013) Pengajaran Bahasa Indonesia di Shanghai: Sebuah Peluang Dan Tantangan; Park, J.H., Potensi dan tantangan bahasa Indonesia menuju bahasa internasional (2015) J.

So far, Indonesia's maritime economic potential has not been optimally developed, especially in Natuna. The area of Natuna Sea is 99.25%, so it is very potential to develop marine tourism. Natuna is also included in the planning of the Global Maritime Fulcrum and is given the authority to manage tourism. Natuna Geopark has also been inaugurated by UNESCO in 2019. The presence of a geopark in Natuna will have an impact on the movement of foreign tourists. Thus, it is necessary to prepare human resources for tour guides to welcome foreign tourists. This study describes the design of Natuna Tourism application with an emphasis on mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) to introduce Natuna tourism in Indonesian, English and Mandarin. Through this application, students can learn independently. This application also features pictures and sounds with a quiz that helps learners to memorize vocabulary. Before designing this application, researchers first conducted interviews with the Natuna tourism service and religious high schools. From the interviews, the application was designed using the Mnemonic method. Researchers hope that with applications on smartphones that can be used offline, the Natuna tourism agency will develop and can contribute to improving the maritime economyfishermen, fish processing technology and illegal fishing. Whereas the obstacle in the field of goods distribution is the Sea Toll Program which is of little help due to the trip schedules of ships which are only twice a month. The fishermen's catch has become no longer fresh and cannot be sold at high prices. There should be special treatment for Natuna by developing a model of economic integration of Maritime and tourism. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

Learning through a game is more fun and beneficial, as proven by some studies. Therefore, in foreign language learning, especially English, many mobile applications are developed and can be downloaded on android phones for free, such as Funland and Monkey Puzzles World Tour. Unfortunately, the application has not been developed based on the needs of Indonesian elementary school students. A game application, called PowPow has been developed to meet those needs in supporting Indonesian students learn English vocabulary. This game has three different themes: house, restaurant and outer space. In each theme, students are motivated to play each prompt question in 30 seconds to complete the game. This application is played by 35 elementary Indonesian students aged 7 to 12 years. After playing the game, it is found out all students agree that this game motivates them to learn English. © 2019 The Authors.

The ideal textbook for the subject can boost learning and student competence and achievement in mastering the language. The selection of textbooks has not taken into consideration the background and motivation of students, learning objectives, frequency and length of study and student expectations. This paper discusses the need for a textbook to be used by IR majors in Indonesia. The data collection is populated through the distribution of questionnaires to eight universities that hold Chinese language classes for IR majors. The study concludes that the students expected a textbook to contain appropriate and applicable formal and informal language acquisition materials related to IR. The study looks at the cultural knowledge of the destination, lessons on the writing of Chinese characters and grammar exercises. Regarding the order of topics for learning Chinese by IR students, the students perceived that the right order would be: greetings, self-introduction, letters and numbers, time, names of days and months, daily activities, transportation, public facilities, directions and instructions, professions, international relations, politics and economy. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Chinese language; Foreign language; International relations; Textbook",,,,,"Sumitomo Foundation","support of this research from the research project “Need Analysis on East Asia Text Book Writing for Teaching the Japanese and Chinese Language as a Second Language for International Relations University Students in Indonesia: An Integrated Approach” funded by the Sumitomo Foundation.","Ali, M., (2014) Memahami Riset Perilaku Dan Sosial [Understanding Behavioral and Social Research], , Jakarta: PT.

The development of cross-border tourism is in line with Jokowi-Jusuf Kalla‘s nine priorities. However, the obstacle in tourism is human resources who fluently speak foreign languages in marketing and communicating with foreign tourists, especially in the border area. Since Natuna is far and difficult to reach, no Natuna‘s university educates their human resources to speak a foreign language and because Natuna is also lack of foreign teacher. Therefore, it needs a breakthrough in foreign language learning through mobile learning applications. As smartphones are commonly used in society, the solution of foreign language learning through smartphone application became an innovation in education and training. The research method was Focus Group Discussion (FGD) between officials of Natuna‘s Regional Planning, Research, and Development Agency. The FGD was done by showing the design of interactive mobile applications for foreign language learning, especially English and Mandarin. The design of this application has been demonstrated in the FGD activities and has received a positive response. The conclusion of this research is Mobile Learning application is a foreign language learning solution to support tourism activities in Natuna. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Cross-border tourism; M-learning application; Natuna","E-learning; Regional planning; Smartphones; Teaching; Cross-border; Foreign language learning; Human resources development; Innovation in educations; Interactive mobile applications; M-Learning; Natuna; Smart-phone applications; Computer aided instruction",,,,,,"Kabupaten, P.D., Kondisi Geografis Kabupaten Natuna, , https://natunakab.go.id/kondisi-geografis-kabupaten-natuna/, Natuna.

Thus, the learning outcome for one year in the world of work can be input to the learning process in the classroom. This research was qualitative-based that involved four important evaluations, notably the program, process, output, and impact. Data collection was conducted through interviews with twenty students of Chinese Literature Department who have completed an internship with companies from China, Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia. The results exhibited that the applied curriculum can improve their hard skills and soft skills. So, they are motivated to adapt in learning and work. From evaluation results, the classroom learning needs to be balanced with the outside class learning or distance learning as learning outcomes are more effective. Moreover, students are able to learn independently by completing the online assignment given by the teacher during the internship. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Compatibility; Curriculum; Evaluation; Learning; Skill","Curricula; Distance education; Teaching; Chinese literature; Classroom learning; Compatibility; Evaluation; Higher education institutions; Learning; Online assignments; Skill; Students",,,,,,"Ali, M., (2014) Memahami Riset Perilaku Dan Sosial, , Bandung: Bumi Aksara; Sanjaya, W., (2008) Kurikulum Dan Pembelajaran, , Kencana Prenada Media Group; Mahao, L., Towards curriculum relevance: The reform experience of the national university of Lesotho (2003) Regional Training Conference on Improving Tertiary Education in Sub-Saharan Africa: Things That Work, , http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTAFRREGTOPTEIA/Resources/nqosa_leuta_Mahao.pdf, Paper Accra, September 23-25, 2003; Muhson, A., Daru, W., Supriyanto, Mulyani, E., Analisis Relevansi Lulusan Perguruan Tinggi dengan Dunia Kerja (2012) Jurnal Economia, 8 (1), pp. 42-52; Ramakrishnan, K., Norizan, M.Y., Employment issues among Malaysian information and communication technology (ICT) graduates: A case study (2012) African Journal of Business Management, 6 (16), pp. 5615-5621; Knight, P.T., Yorke, M., Employability through the curriculum (2002) Tertiary Education and Management, 8, pp. 261-276; Sumantri, M.S., Pengembangan Kurikulum Jurusan PGSD Fakultas Ilmu Pendidikan Universitas Negeri Jakarta (2010) Jurnal Pendidikan Dasar, 1 (1), pp. 1-8; Theichler, U., The changing debate on internationalisation of higher education (2004) Higher Education, 48, pp. 5-26; Das, S., Yost, S.A., Krishnan, M., A 10-year mechatronics curriculum development initiative: Relevance, content, and results—part I (2010) IEEE Transactions on Education, 53 (2), pp. 194-201; Laguador, J.M., Ramos, L., Industry-partners' preferences for graduates: Input on curriculum development (2014) Journal of Education and Literature, 1, pp. 1-8; Parlett, M., Hamilton, D., (1972) Evaluation as Illumination: A New Approach to The Study of Innovatory Programs, , Occasional Paper 9.

As China's investment in Indonesia expands in various industry sectors, the need for qualified translators escalates. However, the situation described that Indonesia lacks competent and qualified translators in Mandarin. The study adopts the qualitative approach. Technically, the study utilizes a variety of secondary data consisting of documents, books, publications, and website to collect data based on the needs of qualified translators and how to improve their competency. In addition, primary data collection involves industry and translation service providers, from high schools, vocational schools, colleges, and Chinese language courses through interviews. In this respect, the study contributes to the development of the Mandarin Chinese translator competency through professional translator training programs. The competencies developed include Mandarin language skills in a variety of contexts or themes such as business, industry, accounting, taxation, law, and socio-political issues. The findings of this research indicate the significance to complement the lack of knowledge and skills that are not acquired during the college. Importantly, the authors propose a professional interpreter training model to meet the demand of Chinese investors in Indonesia eventually. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data acquisition; Economics; Personnel training; Professional aspects; Program translators; Taxation; Teaching; Chinese investors; Economic relations; Industry sectors; Qualitative approach; Socio-political issues; Training program; Translation services; Vocational schools; Translation (languages)",,,,"Kementerian Riset, Teknologi dan Pendidikan Tinggi","We acknowledge the partial financial support of this research from research project “Strategi Pengembangan Daerah Perbatasan di Kepulauan Riau dalam Rangka Implementasi Indonesia sebagai Poros Maritim Dunia by Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia.","Justin, Y.L., Demystifying the Chinese Economy (2013) The Australian Economic Review, 46 (3), pp. 259-268; Eichengreen, B., Donghyun, P., Kwanho, S., When Fast-Growing Economies Slow Down: International Evidence and Implications for China (2012) Asian Economic Papers, 11 (1), pp. 42-86; Xiaoxi, Z., Kevin, D., The determinants of China's outward foreign direct investment (2011) Emerging Markets Review, 12 (4), pp. 389-398; Cheng-Chwee, K., Multilateralism in China's ASEAN policy: Its evolution, characteristics, and aspiration (2005) Contemporary Southeast Asia, 27 (1), pp. 102-122; http://www.rappler.com/indonesia/ekonomi/158819-5-mega-proyek-investasi-china-indonesia; http://www.bareksa.com/id/text/2015/07/27/investor-china-mulai-kucurkan-dana-bangun-smelter-us410-juta/11009/newsd; Anne, L., Translation Skills and Knowledge - Preliminary Findings of a Survey of Translators and Revisers Working at Inter-governmental Organizations (2012) Meta, 57 (1), pp. 108-113; María, D.L.T., A web-based resource to improve translation skills (1999) ReCALL, 11, pp. 41-49; Mohamed, A.M.A., Assessing Aptitude and Attitude Development in a Translation Skills Course (2012) CALICO Journal, 29, pp. 321-340; Mansoor-Ul-H, H., Ahmad, A., Purpose of dictionary use in professional education: A study of dictionary using habits in medical students (2010) Procedia Social and Behavioural Sciences, 2 (2), pp. 3988-3993; Mustafa, A.B., Behcet, C., Naci, Y., International Journal of Social Sciences & Educational Studies (2014) Smart Phone Assisted Language Learning, 1, pp. 67-71; Chinnery, G.M., Going to the MALL: Mobile assisted language learning (2006) Language Learning &technology, 10, pp. 9-16; Robert, G.J., Emerging Technology Mobile Apps for Language Learning (2011) Language Learning & Technology, 15, pp. 2-11",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","4th International Conference on Friendly City 2017","11 October 2017 through 12 October 2017",,135340,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Indonesia, as one of the trade partners of China, should increase the quality and quantity of cooperation with China. In supporting the goal, it requires an ample of human resources ability that is active in socialization, diplomacy, and cooperation establishment with China. The cooperation can be established by mastering of Mandarin. The Department of International Relations realized the situation and complemented its students with foreign language skill such as Mandarin. Based on the evaluation of Chinese learning outcomes to 31 sophomore students, the biggest obstacle of students is to compose a sentence based on vocabularies learned.

The collection of information is done by observation and interviews from February 2014 to February 2015. The authors conclude that not all subjects can be done in virtual or ‘off class.’ The conversation class, reading and grammar should be done face to face because students need the guidance of a lecturer to correct the error tone and pronunciation when communicating and reading as well as in composing a sentence that is related to Chinese grammar. In addition, new technology in teaching Chinese language for foreign students should be introduced to overcome this problem. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Chinese language; Chinese literature department binus university; Illuminative method; Mcl",,,,,"Binus University","This paper was supported in part by BINUS University Grant.","Arthukolara, P.-C., The rise of china and east asian export performance: Is the crowding-out fear warranted?

It caused by potential of China's economic growth in the world. Chinese language has introduced to children in early age in Indonesia. But sometimes learn Chinese language was difficult to them, which will make them feel boring. This paper has purpose to help children learn Chinese language using gamification and mnemonic method into game content. Briefly, gamification is process that adopt game elements to apply into non-game context and mnemonic is strategy to increase memory with various ways. Both in gamification and mnemonic method have applied in previous paper which the conclusion showed positive result in learning environment. This game refers to primary school, which students in 6-12 years old. The conclusion in this paper show that the developed game by authors can interest children to learn Chinese language based by pre-test and post-test result. © 2017 The Authors.

These programs are expected to have a positive outcome which is a better and increased teachers' competence. On the other hand, teacher's well-being might be disturbed by a negative impact from the program. This research aims to seek the subjective wellbeing of teachers in Jakarta and how to help teachers reach its wellbeing. The method use Neuroresearch (mix method), a mixture of qualitative research to build a theoretical construct and also observation as well as in-depth interviews with various parties and quantitative method by using measurement instruments subjective well-being Likert scale. The results found that (1) elementary teachers tend heading to wellbeing significantly at á <0.05 and (2) the cognitive dimension of teachers is an absolute determinant in shaping the well-being of primary school teachers. When a teachers cognitive is improved, then the wellbeing of primary school teachers will be increased by 20.983 from the current conditions. The study also found that the cognitive dimension is determined by the role of family situations and affective quality of teachers capable of acting 13.150 alters cognitive quality teachers.

This paper examines how prove the academic predictions (construt) in Neuroresearch through the construct validity. There are two (2) phases. Phase One, Orthogonal iteration approach. If the results of the Orthogonal iteration have been counted few times, and it is proved the instrument items to be significant with the variable (total score) and each indicator is minimum represented by at least 1 (one) point, then the academic predictions about the variables is proved. But if there is at least one indicator that is not represented by a minimum of 1 point, then the Orthogonal Iteration is not fit and had to go to the second stage. Second stage is Varimax Iterations approach through Principle Component Axis. The analogy of the variable is like a community that consists of a group of people (instrument item). Community (variable) is formed by a small group (indicator) and the members of the group (item) are not always correlated with the group (indicator). Proof of academic prediction of the second phase by calculating rotated component matrix which in the end, will “determine the new name of the indicators”. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.","A model research methods; Construct validity approach",,,,,,,"Anne, A., (1982) Psychological Testing, , 5th edn., Macmillan Publishing Co, Inc., New York; Arthur, A., Elaine, A.N., (1999) Statistic for Psychology, , 2nd edn., Prentice-Hall Inc., New Jersey; Comrey, (1973) Factor Analysis, , Sagre Press, Chicago; Dimitrov, D.M., (2015) Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development, Sage Journal, , http://mec.sagepub.com; Gordon, F.D., (2011) Eksegesis Perjanjian Baru, , Literatur SAAT, Malang; Laurence, G.G., Paul, Y.R., (1995) Reading and Undestanding Multivariate Statistics, , American Psychological Association, Wahington; Larry, H.V., Ingram, O., (1985) Statistical Methods for Meta-Analysis, , Academic Press Inc., New York; Fred, K.N., Elazar, P.J., (1973) Multiple Regression in Behavioral Research, , Holt Rinehart and Winston Inc., New York; Fred, K.N., (1990) Asas-Asas Penelitian Behavioral, Terjemahan oleh Landung R.

In the corridor of carrying out these tasks and building a strong sovereignty of the Indonesian economic system in the future, Bank Indonesia in 2017 has established a National Payment Gateway policy through the Board of Governors' Member Regulation no. 19/10 / PADG / 2017 dated September 20, 2017 concerning the National Payment Gateway. The implementation of NPG is part of Indonesia's nationalist development strategy, therefore Bank BCA as one of the Anchor Banks in Indonesia has a very strategic role in implementing this policy. This research will analyze the challenges faced by BCA in implementing a competitive advantage strategy in order to implement the National Payment Gateway policy. The results of this study are as follows: (1) Identifying problems in NPG implementation (2) Building NPG models and conditions for companies using the theory of Resource Based View, Value Chain, Factor Analysis and VRIO (3) Planning the company's competitive advantage strategy in implementing NPG. © 2020 IEEE.","Competitive advantage; Implementation model; Management strategy; National payment gateway","Information management; Banking industry; Competitive advantage; Development strategies; Economic system; Payment gateways; Resource-based view; Strategic role; Strategy modeling; Competition",,,,,,"Holloway, S.S., Eijnatten Van, F.M., Georges, A., Romme, L., Demerouti, E., Developing actionable knowledge on value crafting: A design science approach (2016) Journal of Business ResearchVolume, 69 (5), pp. 1639-1643. , May 2016; Zafirovski, M., Exploitation in contemporary societies: An exploratory comparative analysis (2019) The Social Science Journal, 56 (4), pp. 565-587. , December 2019; Prévost, B., Rivaud, A., The world bank's environmental strategies: Assessing the influence of a biased use of new institutional economics on legal issues (2018) Ecosystem Services, 29, pp. 370-380. , February 2018; Adams, P., Maria Bodas Freitas, I., Fontana, R., Strategic orientation, innovation performance and the moderating influence of marketing management (2019) Journal of Business Research, 97, pp. 129-140. , April 2019; Kline, P., (2014) An Easy Guide to Factor Analysis, , Routledge Taylor & Francis Group London; Otho, H., (2018) Nation and Character Building, , https://www.bappenas.go.id/id/data-dan-informasiutama/makalah/artikel-majalah-perencanaan/edisi-32-tahun-2003/nation-and-character-building-melalui-pemahaman-wawasankebangsaan-oleh-otho-h-hadi, accessed on October 1 2018; Hui-Wen, T., Anlin, C., How do market power and industry competition influence the effect of corporate governance on earnings management?

Exposure in this paper aims to provide an overview of how socialization of mitigation in dealing with natural disasters carried out by the use of information systems and technology can be successful with reference to the theory of SECI (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, and Internalization), knowledge development with data formed based on the perspective of the community. Factor analysis method is used to look for the success factors of mitigation socialization in the face of natural disasters. Furthermore, from the new factors that are formed, further analysis is carried out with a regression analysis method to develop a successful model of disaster mitigation socialization expected.The results of the study provide a number of new factors that can be represented as variables of community awareness of natural disasters, mitigation socialization processes in the face of natural disasters, availability of systems and information technology, and knowledge management governance on natural disaster mitigation. The conclusion obtained from this study is that the momentum of the industrial revolution era 4.0 can be utilized to support the socialization process of natural disaster mitigation independently measured based on the local wisdom of the local community. © 2020 Author(s).","knowledge management systems; mitigation activities; natural disasters; SECI Model; socialization",,,,,,,"Arya, A., Risk and Vulnerability Profile for Earthquakes and Landslide Hazards' in NIDM-IHC (2005) (2005) Meeting -Ature's Upheavals: A Holistic Look at Disaster Mitigation, pp. 33-49. , India Habitat Center, New Delhi; Nezafati, N., Afrazeh, A., Jalali, D., Mohammad, S., A dynamic model for measuring knowledge level of organizations based on Nonaka and Takeuchi Model (SECI (2009) Scientific Research and Essay., 4, pp. 531-542; Manandhar, B., Remittance and earthquake preparedness (2016) International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 15, pp. 52-60. , March 2016; Ford, A., (2009) Modeling the Environment, p. 380. , Second Edition. 2nd Editio.

The implementation of the method of knowledge transfer in disaster risk reduction includes seismic disaster type, volcanic eruption, lava, landslides, floods, flash floods, tsunamis and droughts. Includes recognition of emergency response, rehabilitation and reconstruction, preparedness, prevention, mitigation and disaster management and vulnerability management. Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) allows collaborating on disaster management issues, sharing information on risk reduction activities, warning systems, handling emergencies, all of which reduce the impact of disasters. The purpose of this study was to observe the factors that influence the performance of a disaster KMS. The study involved 240 respondents and sampling was done by proportional random sampling. The results show that the evaluation models can be constructed through the function of the factors, the organizational culture and the information through KMS, the support and participation of the administration, the accessibility and the updates and the monitoring of the information. © 2018 IEEE.","disaster management; evaluation model; factor analysis; knowledge management systems","Emergency services; Factor analysis; Floods; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Multivariant analysis; Volcanoes; Disaster management; Disaster risk reductions; Evaluation modeling; Evaluation of knowledge; Knowledge management system; Organizational cultures; Sharing information; Vulnerability management; Disaster prevention",,,,,,"Seneviratne, TKK, Amaratunga, RDG, Haigh, RP and Pathirage, CP (2010).

Succesful rate, perfomance rate, and supporting factor became the root cause of this research. Within this research, we know all the key-factor of perfomance measurement of MFT system and give us a blueprint about the perfomance measurement itself. This research will evaluate the perfomance of MFT system using concept of IT Balanced Scorecard (IT BSC) that have 4 perspective which will be the reference to collect data, evaluate data, and do a factor analysis using the data from the questioner. The result of factor analysis generating 4 new factor that have an important role in the MFT system level performance in the company such as System Securities, Business Support from MFT System, System Weaknesses, and System User's Comfortable. © 2016 IEEE.","IT Balanced Scorecard (IT BSC); Managed File Transfer (MFT); Perfomance evaluation","Information management; Multivariant analysis; Balanced scorecards; Business support; Enterprise companies; File transfers; Financial companies; Perfomance; Supporting factors; System-level performance; Factor analysis",,,,,,"Gorla, N., Somers, T.M., Wong, B., Organizational impact of system quality, information quality, and service quality (2010) Journal of Strategic Information Systems, pp. 207-228; Performance Analysis of Highperformance File Transfer Systems for Grid Applications, , Anglano, C., & Canonico, M.

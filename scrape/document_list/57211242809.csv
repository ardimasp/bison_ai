In this case, because of the need for the world of education and coupled with most Japanese people not wanting to use languages other than the original language, Japanese language is now a very important language. On the other hand it is also seen from a person's language skills, based on the results of a survey of 100 international students who continued their studies in Japan, 81 said Japanese was difficult to understand, because the letters were different from ordinary alphabet letters. Therefore we need a new learning model to attract interest and improve one's Japanese language skills. The model was adopted into the game, by using games it is expected that players can understand the letters hiragana and katakana. The game-making method uses a modified game development life cycle so that game creation can be done maximally and flexibly. Then, by adopting the concept of shodo it can produce proportional writing. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Using a survey of 992 retail depositors in Indonesia, we find that trust in individual banks where depositors save their money is greater than trust in the overall banking industry and financial safety net. We also find that depositors’ trust is affected by personal characteristics—for instance, women and older depositors have relatively less trust. Depositors tend to put their trust in individual banks and the financial system if they have greater trust in information conveyed by the government. Religious and economic values have positive effects on depositors’ trust at both the micro and macro levels. Our results also document that risk-taking behavior is positively associated with depositors’ trust. Furthermore, we find that more-educated depositors have significantly less trust. This finding might imply that the erosion of market discipline by depositors in a country with relatively generous deposit insurance, such as Indonesia, can be mitigated through greater financial literacy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Banks; Depositors; Financial system; Survey; Trust",,,,,,,"Acharya, V.V., A theory of systemic risk and design of prudential bank regulation (2009) J.

As a financial asset class, its value should be derived from business prospects, uncertainty, and opportunity cost of money (riskless rate). We model the asset value relationship in form of an error correction model in regard of possible nonstationary data properties. We use GSCI commodity index, SP 500 Index, Economic Policy Uncertainty Index and Yield of 5-year US Treasury Bonds as proxies of explanatory variables. Our findings show that the notion of crypto currency as a financial asset might be spurious. Common stochastic trend is the source of apparent correlation between Bitcoin and the regressors.

We also take advantage of a unique dataset in which depositors are split into different categories of deposit size in different types of banks (bank ownership structure). We consider the Banking Stability Index, which is used by the Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation as a dashboard to monitor banking stability at the country level as well as individual stability measures such as the Z-score. Using monthly data from 2005 to 2013, our findings show that both macro and micro levels of risk are considered by depositors to discipline banks. Large uninsured depositors are more effective at disciplining banks, highlighting the credibility of the insurance system that is in place. Bank ownership type also matters in explaining the difference in market discipline by depositors. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Banking stability index; Deposit structure; Indonesia; Market discipline; Ownership",,,,,"123.31/D2.3/KP/2018","This research was partially supported by the Indonesia Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education through the WCP Program 2018 with contract no. 123.31/D2.3/KP/2018 .

Using the Global Financial Development Database-GFDD, we estimate a regression of net interest margins to a set of variables specifically proxies for competition, capacity and some controlling variables. Panel data econometric techniques employed are fixed effect, random effect and pooled OLS. We find that intermediation cost is positively associated with capital adequacy, overhead cost, return on equity and ZSCORE. On the other hand, it is negatively associated with loan to deposit ratio, deposit to GDP and GDP per capita. Finally, our study has shown that income level and financial deepening have positive impact on intermediation efficiency. © 2020, Universita Putra Malaysia.","Bank intermediation cost; Capacity; Competition; Panel data econometrics",,,,,,,"Aaron, A., Nainggolan, Y.A., Trinugroho, I., Corporate failure prediction model in Indonesia: Revisiting the Z-scores, discriminant analysis, logistic regression and artificial neural network (2017) Journal for Global Business Advancement, 10 (2), pp. 187-209; Al-Harbi, A., The determinants of conventional banks profitability in developing and underdeveloped OIC countries (2019) Journal of Economics, Finance and Administrative Science, 24 (47), pp. 4-28; Allen, L., The determinants of bank interest margins: A note (1988) Journal of Financial and Quantitative analysis, 23 (2), pp. 231-235; Angbazo, L., Commercial bank net interest margins, default risk, interest-rate risk, and off-balance sheet banking (1997) Journal of Banking & Finance, 21 (1), pp. 55-87; Angori, G., Aristei, D., Gallo, M., Determinants of Banks' Net Interest Margin: Evidence from the Euro Area during the Crisis and Post-Crisis Period (2019) Sustainability, 11 (14), p. 3785; Ariss, R.T., On the implications of market power in banking: Evidence from developing countries (2010) Journal of banking & Finance, 34 (4), pp. 765-775; Athanasoglou, P.P., Brissimis, S.N., Delis, M.D., Bank-specific, industry-specific and macroeconomic determinants of bank profitability (2008) Journal of international financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 18 (2), pp. 121-136; Barth, J.R., Caprio, G., Levine, R., (2008) Rethinking bank regulation: Till angels govern, , Cambridge University Press; Beck, T., Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Levine, R., Bank concentration, competition, and crises: First results (2006) Journal of Banking & Finance, 30 (5), pp. 1581-1603; Berger, A.N., Udell, G.F., Some evidence on the empirical significance of credit rationing (1992) Journal of Political Economy, 100 (5), pp. 1047-1077; Berger, A.N., Udell, G.F., Small business credit availability and relationship lending: The importance of bank organisational structure (2002) The economic journal, 112 (477), pp. F32-F53; Berger, A.N., Molyneux, P., Wilson, J.O., (2014) The Oxford handbook of banking, , OUP Oxford; Berger, A.N., Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Levine, R., Haubrich, J.G., Bank concentration and competition: An evolution in the making (2004) Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, pp. 433-451; Boone, J., A new way to measure competition (2008) The Economic Journal, 118 (531), pp. 1245-1261; Boyd, J.H., De Nicolo, G., The theory of bank risk taking and competition revisited (2005) The Journal of finance, 60 (3), pp. 1329-1343; Bresnahan, T.F., The oligopoly solution concept is identified (1982) Economics Letters, 10 (1-2), pp. 87-92; Walsh, C.E., (2017) Monetary theory and policy, , MIT press; Čihák, M., Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Feyen, E., Levine, R., Benchmarking financial systems around the world (2012) World Bank policy research working paper, p. 6175; Degryse, H., Kim, M., Ongena, S., (2009) Microeconometrics of banking: Methods, applications, and results, , Oxford University Press, USA; Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Huizinga, H., Financial structure and bank profitability (2000) World Bank Policy Research Working Paper, p. 2430; Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Levine, R., (2004) Financial structure and economic growth: A cross-country comparison of banks, markets, and development, , MIT press; Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Laeven, L., Levine, R., Regulations, Market Structure, Institutions, and the Cost of Financial Intermediation (2004) Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 36 (3), pp. 593-622; Demirguc-Kunt, A., Martínez Pería, M.S., (2010) A framework for analyzing competition in the banking sector: An application to the case of Jordan, , The World Bank; Dietrich, A., Wanzenried, G., Determinants of bank profitability before and during the crisis: Evidence from Switzerland (2011) Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 21 (3), pp. 307-327; Eichenbaum, M.S., Hansen, L.P., Singleton, K.J., A time series analysis of representative agent models of consumption and leisure choice under uncertainty (1988) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 103 (1), p. 5178; Entrop, O., Memmel, C., Ruprecht, B., Wilkens, M., Determinants of bank interest margins: Impact of maturity transformation (2015) Journal of Banking & Finance, 54, pp. 1-19; Fischer, K.H., Pfeil, C., (2003) Regulation and competition in German banking: An assessment, , (No. 2003/19).

More specifically, we find that in the short-run, higher market power is associated with higher bank risk, while the impact is the opposite in the long-run. By decomposing the component of banks' Z-scores, we find two plausible channels to explain our main results. First, we find that an increase in market power is associated with an increase in the volatility of bank profit in one year lag, which might imply a tendency for 'gamble for-profits' in the short-run. Second, an increase in market power is associated with a higher capital ratio in two years lag, which suggests that banks might offset the increase in the short-term risk with more cushion. Moreover, we also find some evidence that an increase in market power is associated with a higher deposits growth in two years lag. This might suggest an indirect market discipline, in which depositors respond to the long-run impact of bank market power on bank risk. Our results are robust on several alternative econometric specifications. © 2020 Universita Putra Malaysia.","Bank market power; Indonesia; Intertemporal effect; Risk-taking",,,,,,,"Albaity, M., Mallek, R.S., Noman, A.H., Competition and bank stability in the MENA region: The moderating effect of Islamic versus conventional banks (2019) Emerging Markets Review, 38, pp. 310-325; Arellano, M., Bond, S., Some tests of specification for panel data: Monte Carlo evidence and an application to employment equations (1991) Reviews of Economic Studies, 58, pp. 277-297; Arellano, M., Bover, O., Another look at the instrumental variable estimation of error-component models (1995) Journal of Econometrics, 68, pp. 29-51; Ariefianto, M.D., Widuri, R., Abdurachman, E., Trinugroho, I., The effect of competition and capacity on bank intermediation cost: A cross country study (2020) International Journal of Economics and Management, , (forthcoming); Baltagi, B.H., (2005) Econometric Analysis of Panel Data, , John Wiley and Sons Ltd., Chichester; Barry, T.A., Lepetit, L., Tarazi, A., Ownership structure and risk in publicly held and privately owned banks (2011) Journal of Banking and Finance, 35 (5), pp. 1327-1340; Beck, T., Dermirguc-Kunt, A., Levine, R., Bank concentration, competition and crises: First results (2006) Journal of Banking and Finance, 30, pp. 1581-1603; Beck, T., Jonghe, O.D., Schepens, G., Bank competition and stability: Cross-country heterogeneity (2013) Journal of Financial Intermediation, 22, pp. 218-244; Berger, A.N., Klapper, L.F., Ariss, R.T., Bank competition and financial stability (2009) Journal of Financial Services Research, 35, pp. 99-118; Bertay, A.K., Demirguc-Kunt, A., Huizinga, H., Do we need big banks?

We find that bank margins are affected mainly by competition and diversification. In this less competitive market, Islamic rural banks are able to set high margins. Islamic rural banks are also tend set high margins when they do not diversify their revenue, referring to the cross-subsidization strategy. We also find that the impact of competition and diversification on bank margins are more pronounced in the banks with lower banks’ loan contract diversification and also banks with a higher proportion of profit-and-loss sharing (PLS) lending. However, those impacts diminish when Islamic banks are located in provinces with above-average numbers of Muslims and located outside Java. Our empirical results therefore also suggest that regional differences matter for bank margins. © 2018 The Authors","Bank margins; Competition; Diversification; Indonesia; Islamic rural banks",,,,,,,"Abduh, M., Omar, M.A., Islamic banking and economic Growth: The Indonesian experience (2012) International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 5 (1), pp. 35-47; Abedifar, P., Molyneux, P., Tarazi, A., Risk in Islamic banking (2013) Review of Finance, 17 (6), pp. 2035-2096; Baele, L., De Jonghe, O., Vander Vennet, R., Does the stock market value bank diversification?

We take into account bank specific characteristics, bank governance, banking competition and regional characteristics to explain the difference in sustainability of rural banks. By studying 144 Indonesian rural banks located in 23 provinces over the period of 2010-2016, we find that banking competition measured by Lerner index and banking density is strongly negatively associated with viability of rural banks. Further, involvement of owners in the management is found to lessen the viability of such kind of banks. Well established rural banks would more likely be survived than newly established ones. Socio-economic and socio-political factors at the regional level have significant effect on the sustainability of rural banks.

Individuals' religiosity is considered as one of the important determinants of Islamic banks' rapid expansion, even though at some point religiosity could have a detrimental effect on the economy. This paper addresses the impact of regions' religiosity on Islamic banks' profitability and stability. Using a data of 146 Islamic rural banks in Indonesia from 2012q1 to 2015q4, we find that religiosity matters for Islamic banks' performance. We also find in this paper that Islamic banks located in the regions with higher religiosity level have better profitability and stability than those located in the less religious provinces. Additionally, this effect is more pronounced for small Islamic banks and those located outside Java island. This paper also discusses an important policy implication based on the results.","Indonesia; Islamic banks; Performance; Profitability; Religiosity; Stability",,,,,,,"Abedifar, P., (2016) Lending, the Poor & Islamic Scripture: Islamic Finance versus Welfare Islam, , SSRN Working Paper; Aggarwal, R.K., Yousef, T., Islamic Banks and Investment Financing (2000) Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 32 (1), pp. 93-120; Alam, N., Parinduri, R.A., Do Islamic banks shift from mark-up to equity financing when their contracting environments are improved?

Using monthly panel data of 104 banks over the January 2005 - December 2013 period, we empirically test our model. Panel data technique is used to estimate the parameter. We find that the model is well supported. The coefficient of loan growth is positive while reserves inventory is negative. Nevertheless, we find the spread to JIBOR O/N and business index to be negative which contradict our hypotheses. The results are largely unaltered when we account for turbulence period. © 2015, Virtus Interpress.

Using provincial-level data for 33 provinces from 2004 to 2010, we find that poor local governance significantly impedes financial deepening. Our results also conclude that in the socioeconomically less developed regions, the level of financial deepening is lower than that of more developed regions. Various policy implications are provided. Even though decentralization has been implemented, regional disparity in the form of financial deepening still exists. Improving local governance should be imposed to facilitate favorable business environment. Moreover, regulators have to reconsider regulations that have constrained bank lending.",,,,,,,,"Akita, T., Alisjahbana, A.S., Regional Income Inequality in Indonesia and the Initial Impact of the Economic Crisis (2002) Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies, 38, pp. 201-222; Aritenang, A.F., A Study on Indonesia Regions Disparity: Post Decentralization (2008) MPRA working paper; Becerra, O., Cavallo, E., Scartascini, C., The politics of financial development: The role of interest groups and government capabilities (2012) Journal of Banking & Finance, 36, pp. 626-643; Beck, T., Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Levine, R., Law and finance: why does legal origin matter?

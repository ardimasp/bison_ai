One of the features of CRM are customer satisfaction level analyses. It is a verbal communication means of sending or receiving information. There are several intonations spoken during verbal communication that reflect the emotional state. Therefore, it can be used to get information regarding the level of customer satisfaction. Sound is one type of digital data that can be processed for an emotional state of classification. In this research, the authors decided to develop a mobile application that is integrated with machine learning to record a sound and classify it into a particular emotional state. This application is believed to be able to improve the user experience and simplify the installation to improve communication engagement. © 2019 IEEE.","component; formatting; style; styling","Android (operating system); Information management; Mobile computing; Public relations; Sales; Application development; component; Customer relationship management; formatting; Mobile applications; style; styling; Verbal communications; Customer satisfaction",,,,,,"A Face Recognition System Based on Convolution Neural Network Using Multiple Distance Face, Soft Computing; A Simulation Model for the Waterfall Software Development Life Cycle, International Journal of Engineering & Technology, 25; Chennai, S., (2016) Salesforce, , https://www.salesforcetraining.education/importance-featuressalesforce-make-mandatory-learn/, July 26 Retrieved from www. salesforcetraining. education:; (2013) International Conference on Cognitive Infocommunications, 403-406, , Classification of Emotional Speech Units in Call Centre Interactions Budapest, IEEE; (2011) International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 5692-5695. , Iterative feature normalization for emotional speech detection Prague, Czech RepublicIEEE; (2015) Python in Science Conference, pp. 18-24. , librosa: Audio and Music Signal Analysis in Python; Speech Emotion Recognition Approaches in Human Computer Interaction, Telecommunication Systems, 523, pp. 1467-1478; Speech Emotion Recognition Using Support Vector Machine, International Journal of Smart Home, pp. 6101-6107; Priyotno, A., (2019), https://inet.detik.com/consumer/d-4446865/samsung-masih-rajaponsel-di-Indonesia-ini-daftar-5-besarnya, Feb 27 detik com.

The difference between this research application and others is the search feature based on an image. The search feature is designed to match the shape and orientation. This application uses a Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm to conduct the matching feature process. The SURF algorithm is divided into three main steps. The first step is to retrieve the image information and turn it into a matrix, using a Hessian - Laplace Technique to define the feature point following the integral to reduce the computational time. It also uses a Difference of Gaussian in order to handle the object with an invariant scale. This process is called Fast Hessian. The second step is to define the orientation of the image using a Haar Wavelet Responses Technique. The third step is to match the feature points from both images using a four dimensional vector and K-Means as a classification technique.

Some of these images are genuine, while some others have gone through modifications. Although the creation and posting of edited photographs in media are basically not prohibited, it becomes a problem when they are used improperly. Until now, the common practice in Indonesia when assessing whether an image has been modified or is original is still heavily dependent on human expert assessment that could be subjective. This research offers an alternative solution that is objective by developing a systematic image analysis method for distinguishing between original and modified image. The method utilizes high-level feature, namely the metadata of the image file, to differentiate between original and modified image. A prototype system was implemented in Visual Basic as a desktop application. The application used MS Windows GDI+. This prototype application can be used as a reliable and faster means to assist in fake image detection. However, as metadata-based analysis only detects whether a photograph has possibly been edited and it does not show which part of the photograph has been manipulated, future work includes development of pixel-based analysis approach. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Metadata; Photography; Alternative solutions; Analysis approach; Comparison study; Desktop applications; High-level features; Image analysis method; Image detection; Prototype system; Image analysis",,,,"Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Tinggi, DIKTI","This research is supported by DIKTI Hibah Bersaing research funding 2016.","Kaskus, (2014), Super-ngakak-meme-foto-syahrini-tiduran-di-padang-rumput-di-itali-yang-unyu- unyu Retrieved from http://www.kaskus.co.id/thread/53ce6cf45a5163b46f8b46f8/super-ngakak-meme-foto-syahrini-tiduran-di-padang-rumput-di-itali-yang-unyu-unyu/82; Indonesian Voices, G., (2015), http://www.globalindonesianvoices.com/18576/foto-mesra-ketua-kpk-abraham-samad-says-intimate-photos-with-elvira-devinamira-are-fake/; Forester, T., Morrison, P., (1994) Computer Ethics: Cautionary Tales and Ethical Dilemmas in Computing, , 2nd ed (Cambridge MA: MIT Press); (2007) Section 14: Best Practices for Image Authentication, , http://www.crime-scene-investigator.net/swgit-section14.pdf; Farid, H., (2009) A Survey of Image Forgery Detection IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 26 (2), pp. 16-25; Sencar, H., Memon, N., (2009) Overview of State-of-the-art in Digital Image Forensics Algorithms, Architectures and Information Systems Security, p. 325; Mahdian, B., Saic, S., A bibliography on blind methods for identifying image forgery (2010) Image Communication, 25, pp. 389-399; Mahdian, B., Saic, S., Nedbal, R., JPEG quantization table forensics: A statistical approach (2010) Proceedings of International Workshop on Computational Forensics, pp. 150-159; Kakar, P., Sudha, N., Ser, W., (2011) Exposing Digital Image Forgeries by Detecting Discrepancies in Motion Blur IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 13, pp. 443-452; Popescu, A.C., Farid, H., (2005) Exposing Digital Forgeries in Color Filter Array Interpolated Images IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 53, pp. 3948-3959; Kakar, P., Sudha, N., Authenticating image metadata elements using geolocation information and sun direction estimation (2012) Proceedings of International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME), pp. 236-241; Working Group, M., (2010) Guidelines for Handling Image Metadata v2.0., , http://www.metadataworkinggroup.org/specs/; http://imageforensic.org/, Ghiro [Software]; Kee, E., Johnson, M.K., Farid, H., (2011) Digital Image Authentication from JPEG Headers IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 6 (3), pp. 1066-1075; http://raymondbahana.blog.binusian.org/rekayasa-photo-i; http://raymondbahana.blog.binusian.org/rekayasa-photo-ii",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Computing and Applied Informatics, ICCAI 2016","14 December 2016 through 15 December 2016",,127044,17426588,,,,"English","J.

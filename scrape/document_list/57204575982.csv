PT. XYZ is one of the insurance company in Indonesia that has implemented the core information system for operational, however, the fact is that the number of complaints against the system, and the reluctance to use the system continues to increase. This study will evaluate the core operational information system in PT. XYZ using IS success model Delone McLean and technology acceptance model in evaluating factors influencing IS success and technology acceptance and determining factors that still need to be improved in achieving IS success and technology acceptance to company information system that has been implemented. The number of samples is 194 respondents, and all of them are employees of PT. XYZ that uses the core information system. Data obtained from questionnaires distributed to respondents and measurement of validity, reliability and regression analysis using SPSS 20. Found that the most important factor of IS success and technology acceptance is information quality. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Application; Core information system; Insurance company; IS success; Technology acceptance",,,,,,"Chan, Y.E., Reich, B.H., IT alignment: What have we learned?

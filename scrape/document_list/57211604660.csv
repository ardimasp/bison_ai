More and more jobs, increasingly complex work environment, the demands of the times, accuracy and speed of work require auditors inevitably must adopt technology. This research began with our success as academics in the audit family. Related to Indonesia, a large country and has several hundred public accounting firms and thousands of auditors, but computerized use of audits using software is still very little. The public accounting firm still uses a manual system, using normally typed paperwork. We want to find out what can boost the use of software among auditors. Our results are useful for auditors in Indonesia. From the results of statistical tests we found that auditors use compilation software by individual auditors themselves rather than organizations and individuals © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

The sample selection is done by purposive sampling technique, the sample results that meet the criteria are 78 samples. The research method used is multiple linear methods, where the results of the research partially show that the liquidity financial variable does not significantly affect fraudulent financial statements, variable audit rotations significantly influence fraudulent financial statements, and variable audit tenure does not significantly influence financial statement fraud. © BEIESP.","About four or phrases in alphabetical order; Separated by commas",,,,,,"Memr, R.I., (2018) Handbook of Energy and Economic Statistics of Indonesia 2018; Lal Bhasin, M., Corporate Accounting Fraud: A Case Study of Satyam Computers Limited (2013) Open J.

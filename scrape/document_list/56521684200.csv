The most important thing in security systems is the process of encryption and authentication. Various encryption techniques are developed to overcome security problems of the data. One of the methods used for authentication of data is Zero Knowledge Proof. This method works to identify the authenticity of someones statement to proof without showing any knowledge of the statement mentioned. This research will mainly discuss about the security of data transmission system by combining data encryption and data authentication. The proposed data encryption is using Advanced Encryption System and method for authentication of data using the Zero Knowledge Proof. This research will conduct the development methods of authentication Zero Knowledge Proof from previous research and the result was compared with the proposed method based on the simulation results transmission system client and server. Experiments will be conducted using thirty-text data, each of data will be measured on the performance of both encryption and authentication process between the previous method and proposed method. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed method has better speed to process application for security of data transmission systems, with performance to authenticate approximately 5 ms from the client side and server side. © 2020","Authentication; Data transmission; Discrete logarithm; Encyption; Modular arithmetic; Zero Knowledge Proof","Authentication; Cryptography; Data communication systems; Data privacy; Data transfer; Modems; Security systems; Authentication of data; Data authentication; Development method; Encryption technique; Process applications; Security problems; Transmission systems; Zero knowledge proof; Internet of things",,,,,"Andreadis, G., Fourtounis, G., Konstantinos-Dionysios, B., Collaborative design in the era of cloud computing (2015) Adv Eng Softw, 81, pp. 66-72; Camenisch, J.L., Group signature schemes and payment systems based on the discrete logarithm problem, ETH series in information security an cryptography (1998), Hartung-Gorre-Verlag Germany; Canavan, J.E., (2001), The fundamentals of network security.

Some network hops may be needed to send a packet from one node to another node in the MANET. To do the communication between the nodes, a route has to be selected in the network, therefore it need a routing protocol that manage selection of the route. Selection route in mobile ad-hoc network is not easy because nodes always move so that the topology of network always changed every time. This is a big issue in selection route in mobile ad-hoc network because the route can be broken anytime. Moreover, MANET is more vulnerable than other wireless communication types because every mobile node serves as both the host and the router and forwards packets on behalf of each other. This study presents the analyzing and evaluation several routing algorithms and a novel scheme to build an authentication system by adding the modified zero knowledge proof algorithm to each mobile node in MANET. © 2014 B.

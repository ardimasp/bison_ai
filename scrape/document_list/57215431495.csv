The existence of this medical record can provide health profile information and medical history of the patients being treated. With this basis, doctors and medical staff can provide diagnoses, suggestions for actions to be taken as well as accuracy in determining the drug for patient consumption. However, medical records in the system at the hospital have not been packaged properly invalid data conditions, because the data collection and input processes were carried out by different officers. Not only the ability of officers to interact with information system modules but also discipline, accuracy, mastery of officers in the medical field as well as the ability to read manual documents to be re-entered into the information system. This research was carried out based on direct monitoring of the system used in several hospitals and found the existence of data invalidity in the information system that has the potential to become a risk that ultimately becomes a loss both for patients and for medical staff and hospital management. Allowing invalid data will be a threat that comes from within the hospital environment itself. © 2020 IEEE.","Data validation; Electronic medical record; Health information system; Information system security; Risk management","Diagnosis; Hospitals; Human resource management; Information management; Information use; Medical computing; Patient treatment; Data collection; Direct monitoring; Hospital environment; Hospital information systems; Hospital management; Medical fields; Medical history; Medical record; Medical information systems",,,,,"(2005) Information Technology Security Techniques Code of Practice for Information Security Management International, , I. 27002; Appari, A., Johnson, M.E., Information security and privacy in healthcare: Current state of research (2010) Int.

This is because to simplify the decision-making process, one of which is the determination of prospective credit customers at Bank ABC. Bank ABC is one of the financial institutions in the growth phase needed to improve the quality of safe, high-quality and accurate credit. The purpose of this study is to accelerate the decision making process of credit customers, namely whether credit is accepted or rejected. One method used is CRISP-DM as standart processes for data mining. Election algorithm using the C4.5 decision tree algorithm. The final result of this study is the prediction of the pattern of credit results for credit customers. This pattern is generated from decision tree is expexted to be a reference for credit customer take a credit at Bank ABC. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

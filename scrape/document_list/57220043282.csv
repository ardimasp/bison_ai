Many people are clueless regarding what to do when an earthquake occurs. An earthquake has caused a more devastating outcome due to it being able to lead to other hazards. The idea of developing a mobile application surfaced by reading and receiving inspiration from the previous research. Previous research has been implementing different kinds of ways to alert people regarding the upcoming earthquake. The development of a mobile application to provide a platform that will assist people with information on what to do in times of before, during, and after the earthquake. Therefore, people will have a source that they can turn to when seeking information about the steps to be done when an earthquake occurs. Besides, providing information apropos to earthquakes, the mobile application will send further alerts to the people that are in that specific area. Moreover, people will be able to be aware of the particular areas that they are in. The alerts sent will give information to the people so that they could evacuate to safety as soon as possible before the upcoming earthquake occurs. © 2019 IEEE.","a mobile application for mitigation; Earthquake disaster mobile application; natural disaster mitigation","Disasters; Engineering education; Mobile computing; Indonesia; Mobile application development; Mobile applications; Natural disasters; Specific areas; Earthquakes",,,,,"Zambrano, A.M., Perez, I., Palau, C., Esteve, M., Technologies of internet of things applied to an earthquake early warning system (2017) Future Generation Computer Systems, 75, pp. 206-215; Pascapurnama, D.N., Murakami, A., Chagan-Yasutan, H., Hattori, T., Sasaki, H., Egawa, S., Integrated health education in disaster risk reduction: Lesson learned from disease outbreak following natural disasters in Indonesia (2018) International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, (29), pp. 94-102; Graham, F., (2013) Predicting Earthquakes and Saving Lives -with a Smartphone, , https://www.bbc.com, bbc.com, July. 9, [Online]., [Accessed: Sept. 25, 2018]; Kaur, H., Singh Sawhney, R., Komal, N., Wireless sensor networks for disaster management (2012) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Engineering & Technology, 1 (5); (2017) Looking Back at 2017: Natural Disasters in Indonesia, , https://www.Indonesia-investments.com/, Indonesia Investments, Indonesia Investments, Dec. 29, [Online]; (2018) Natural Disasters in Indonesia, , https://www.Indonesia-investments.com/, Indonesia Investments, Indonesia Investments, Sept. 3, [Online]; Wachter, J., Babeyko, A., Fleischer, J., Haner, R., Hammitzsch, M., Kloth, A., Lendholt, M., Development of tsunami early warning systems and future challenges (2012) Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, 12 (1923-1935). , June; Goda, K., Petrone, C., De Risi, R., Rossetto, T., Stochastic coupled simulation of strong motion and tsunami for the 2011 tohoku, Japan earthquake (2017) Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assesment, 31 (9), pp. 2337-2355; Goda, K., De Risi, R., Multi-hazard loss estimation for shaking and tsunami using stochastic rupture sources (2018) Internation Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 28, pp. 539-554; Okada, K., Nakamura, Y., Saruta, M., Application of earthquake early warning system to seismic-isolated buildings (2009) Journal of Disaster Research, 4 (4); Greco, L., Ritrovato, P., Tiropanis, T., Xhafa, F., (2018) IoT and Semantic Web Technologies for Event-detection in Natural Disasters, , [Online]; Erdelj, M., Natalizio, E., Uav-Assisted disaster management: Applications and open issue (2016) International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC 2016), pp. 1-5. , Feb 2016, Kauai, United States; Cheng, M.H., Beck, J.L., Earthquake early warning application to buildings (2014) Engineering Structure, 60, pp. 155-164; Yu, M., Yang, C., Li, Y., Big data in natural disaster management: A review (2018) Geosciences, 18 (165). , May, [online].

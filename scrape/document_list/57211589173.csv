The use of FinTech as a means of payment becomes a new phenomenon, while the continuous development of the online transport system is becoming a complement for the ease of users. However, the developments that occur produce the impact of the inherent risk to the system and to the users of the service. Therefore, this study aims to see the correlation between inherent risk factors that users feel from various aspects, and do the inherent risk influence the usage of Financial Technology especially in Online Transportation System? The research was conducted using a quantitative statistical method by using SPSS correlation bivariate and a descriptive analysis. In this study found 26 correlations that associated with the use of Financial Technology services and the inherent technology risks have a negative influence on Financial Technology system. © 2018 IEEE.","fintech; inherent technolgy risk; jinancial technolgy; quantitative method; sharing economy","Information management; Online systems; Continuous development; Descriptive analysis; fintech; jinancial technolgy; Quantitative method; sharing economy; Technology service; Transportation system; Finance",,,,,"ACKNOWLEDGMENT Thanks to BINUS University grant no. 014/VR.RTT/III/2018 who support the funding for this research until the publication.","Geranio, M., Fintech in the exchange industry: Potential for disruption?

With the recurring spread of fake news in recent time, it provides opportunities for higher education students to be able to receive and spread the fake news through LINE group. The purpose of this research: first, to show college students' activities and the intention of awareness to receive fake news by users. Second, to measure the number of college student groups with awareness of spread fake news. Third, to investigate whether Higher education students with many groups can make or modify fake news. There are 15 questions using a Likert scale and 5 multiple choice questions which are shown to higher education students and presented by using statistical descriptive explanatory analysis for this research. The result of this research is higher education students have many groups and this does not affect the number of fake news because Higher education students need to do advanced research on the news and see if the news has a reliable source. The number of groups in the LINE mobile application imposes no effect on the spread of fake news. © 2017 IEEE.","Fake News; Groups; Higher education students; LINE; Social Media","Information management; Mobile computing; Social networking (online); Fake News; Groups; Higher education students; LINE; Social media; Students",,,,,,"Penyebar Berita Hoax di Indonesia Bisa Raup Rp700 Jutaan, , https://www.cnnindonesia.com/teknologi/20161202085641185-176767/penyebar-berita-hoax-di-indonesia-bisa-raup-rp700-jutaan/, [Online], [Accessed: 20-Aug-2017]; Kehadiran Hoax Hari Ini Oleh Abel Salsabil-Kompasiana.com, , http://www.kompasiana.com/abelsalsabil/kehadiranhoax-hari-ini_593029294b7a6171097eb915, [Online], [Accessed: 20-Aug-2017]; Hoax Jadi Ladang Bisnis Karena Masyarakat Kurang Kritis, , http://www.beritasatu.com/digital-life/449615-hoax-jadiladang-bisnis-karena-masyarakat-kurang-kritis.html, [Online], [Accessed: 30-Aug-2017]; Awas Hoax!

E-wallet is a program or service which allows its user to save digital money and doing transactions easily whenever and wherever. Many banks and nonbank companies are competing to create innovation in this field. Go Mobile is an e-wallet product of CIMB Niaga, meanwhile, T-Cash is an e-wallet issued by a telecommunication company, PT Telkomsel. This research aimed to analyze the system, purchase and payment methods in Go Mobile and T-Cash. This research was done in qualitative design, used secondary data sourced from official websites of both companies as well as related researches. The result showed that Go Mobile and T-Cash's systems could ease the user's transaction. Go Mobile and T-Cash could be used in purchase and payment transaction through SMS as well as Android-based Smartphone application. In T-Cash, users who do not own an Android Smartphone could enjoy this service by attaching Near Field Communication (NFC) sticker on their phone. This is called T-Cash Tap. Based on the usage and ease of use, T-Cash as a telecommunication e-wallet had received highest acceptance in a society based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). © 2017 IEEE.","bank; E-wallet; payment; purchase; telecommunication","Android (operating system); Information management; Near field communication; Purchasing; Sales; Smartphones; Telecommunication; Android smartphone; bank; payment; Payment transactions; Smart-phone applications; Technology acceptance model; Telecommunication companies; The near field communication (NFC); Electronic money",,,,,,"Dospinescu, O., (2012) E-Wallet.

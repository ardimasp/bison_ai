This is a human trait inherited from generation to generation. Where we can feel happy, interested or amazed by the beauty of nature. The rapid development and technological advances make our relationship with nature farther away. As a result, we become indifferent to the environment around us, the degeneration of ecosystems, and cause mental disorders and stress. Stress and stress disorders are problems that are often experienced by office workers in big cities like Jakarta. There are 60.8% of office workers experiencing depression and stress. One factor causing stress is the work environment, which is a dense urban area. Therefore, rebuilding our relationship with nature becomes more important in the field of conservation. The concept of biophilic design is a design approach based on biophilia aspects which aims to produce coworking spaces that can reduce stress and provide mental and physical healing to its users. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Biophilic design; coworking space; sustainable architecture","Architecture; Office buildings; Sustainable development; coworking space; Dense urban areas; Design approaches; Mental disorders; Stress disorders; Sustainable architecture; Technological advances; Work environments; Occupational risks",,,,,"Amjad, A., Asaad, A., Abdushaik, Z.K., Khalil, S., Biophilic architecture, the concept of healthy sustainable architecture (2006) PLEA2006-23rd International Conference on Passive and Low Energy Architecture, Conference Proceedings, pp. 1383-1386; Browning, W., Ryan, C., Clancy, J., (2014) Fourteen Patterns of Biophilic Design; Ana, H., Biophilic Design, Restorative Environments and Well-Being (2014) 9th International Conference on Design and Emotion 2014: The Colors of Care; Kellert, S., Heerwagen, J., Mador, M., (2008) Biophilic Design: The Theory, Science, and Practice of Bringing Buildings to Life; Ryan Catherine, O., BIOPHILIC DESIGN PATTERNS: Emerging Nature-Based Parameters for Health and Well-Being in the Built Environment (2014) International Journal of Architectural Research: ArchNet-IJAR, [S.l.], 8, pp. 62-76; Wilson, E.O., (1984) Biophilia: The Human Bond with Other Species","Suharjanto, G.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: gatotsuharjanto@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

To handle this problem, this research conducts an effort to develop methods to determine tensile strength properties of Friction Stir Welding (FSW) in Aluminum alloy using prediction model. An artificial intelligent technique, i.e. Artificial Neural Network (ANNs) is used to develop the prediction model. Initial work involves FSW welding experiment and testing of subsequent result to analyze the tensile strength properties of the welding structure based on process parameter input. Prediction model is developed based on Back Propagation (BP) of error to predict tensile strength of the FSW structure. Input parameters for the model is tool rotational speed and travel speed while output of the model is the tensile strength of FSW welded structures. Proposed prediction model is then trained with experiment data. Testing of the proposed prediction model was then conducted using unused experiment data from the training. Research result shows that proposed prediction model is aligned with experiment data. This shows that average error value from the training and testing is 0.010286 or very small (close to zero) which means that the desired output of the prediction model for the training and testing is close to each other. Result from regression graph for training and testing shows matching linear regression between output and target when compared to dash line of the ideal result. This shows an absolute linear relationship where R equals to 0.9 or close to 1. This proves good compatibility the prediction model. © IEOM Society International.","Artificial neural network; Friction stir welding; Tensile strength",,,,,,"Chen, S.C., Lin, S.W., Tseng, T.Y., Lin, H.C., Optimization of back-propagation network using simulated annealing approach 2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics October 8-11, pp. 2819-2824. , 2006, Taipei, Taiwan; Uzun, H., Donne, C.D., Argagnotto, A., Ghidini, T., Gambaro, C., Friction stir welding of dissimilar Al 6013-T4 To X5CrNi18-10 stainless steel (2005) Materials & Design, 26, pp. 41-46; Okuyucu, H., Kurt, A., Erol Arcaklioglu, Artificial neural network application to the friction stir welding of aluminum plates (2007) Elsevier, Materials and Design, 28, pp. 78-84; Zhou, J., Ren, J., Yao, C., Multi-objective optimization of multi-axis ball-end milling Inconel 718 via grey relational analysis coupled with RBF neural network and PSO algorithm (2017) Elsevier, Measurement, 102, pp. 271-285. , May; Maleki, E., Sherafatnia, K., Investigation of single and dual step shot peening effects on mechanical and metallurgical properties of 18CrNiMo7-6 steel using artificial neural network (2016) Int.

One of the big impacts is in organizational process especially in Human Resource Management (HRM). With the help of Information Technology, it changed the way of t raditional HR into modern HR. One of the most popular technology for HRM is Electronic Human Resource Management (E-HRM). E-HRM is an application of information technology that allows managers, applicants and employees access to human resource related information and services through the Internet. In this study we focused to discuss the success factor of E-HRM project implementation and the challenge of implementing E-HRM project. The successful E-HRM implementation can be achieved if there are a support from top management and many factors. However, there are still many challenges for implementing E-HRM. With this kind of factor and challenge, organization must know what to do before implementing the E-HRM system. © 2020, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

Important data like database or documents of web application are stored in server. The server must active for a long time and doing a heavy process, if the room temperature is not conducive it can cause a decrease of server performance. Because of this problem we proposed a monitoring system that can be used a solution for this problem. In this research we create a monitoring system using Raspberry Pi and DHT11 sensor. The results obtained that the temperature data received by the sensor are successfully sent and stored into a database using Raspberry Pi, the accuracy results of the DHT11 sensor used is 98.15% and the system successfully sent an e-mail notification when the temperature data received from the sensor passed the normal limit (20°C-25°C). © IJSTR 2019.","Humidity sensor; Internet; Monitoring; MySQL database; Raspyberry Pi; Server; Temperature sensor",,,,,,"Nawale, B., Allurwar, N., Temperature/Humidity Monitoring Webserver (2016) Int.

With the development of machine learning technique, many researchers had used machine learning techniquesfor indoor positioning system.However, the existing research still uses location classification, even though machine learning can be used as regression to predict location. In this study, we propose a positioning algorithm forindoor positioning system using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), fingerprinting approach and four machine learning regression: Artificial Neural Network Regression (ANN), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Random Forest Regression (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). We compare theperformance in term of Mean of Error, Min of Error, Max of Error, Median of Error and 90 th Percentile of Error between four machine learning regression and the weighted sum method as a benchmark. The results obtained that allmachine learning regression has lowerMean of errorcompared to the weighted sum method.

Hydroponics has become a reality for greenhouse growers in virtually all climates. Large hydroponic installations exist throughout the world for growing flowers, vegetables and some short period fruit like tomato and cucumber. In soilless culture, we must maintain stable pH and conductivity level of nutrient solution to make plant grow well, large variation of pH of certain time will poisoned plant. This paper describes development complete automation hydroponic system, from maintaining stable nutrient composition (conductivity and pH), grow light, and monitor plant environment such as CO2, temperature and humidity. The heart of our automation is ARM Cortex-M4 from ST Microelectronic running ARM mbed OS, the official Real Time Operating System (RTOS) for ARM Cortex-M microcontroller. Using RTOS gives us flexibility to have multithreaded process. Results show that system capable to control desired concentration level with variation of less than 3%, pH sensor show good accuracy 5.83% from pH value 3.23-10. Growing light intensity measurement show result 105 μmol/m2/s therefore we need turn on the light at least 17 hours/day to fulfil plant light requirement. RTOS give good performance with latency and jitter less than 15 us, system overall show good performance and accuracy for automating hydroponic plant in vegetative phase of growth. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","ARM Cortex-M; growing light; Hydroponic; mbed OS; nutrient solution; RTOS","Computer operating systems; Microcontrollers; Microelectronics; Nutrients; pH; pH sensors; Arm cortices; Hydroponic; Light-intensity measurement; Nutrient solution; Nutrient-rich solutions; Real time operating system; RTOS; Temperature and humidities; ARM processors",,,,,"Ahmad, R., Ahad, K., Iqbal, R., Muhammad, A., Acute Poisoning Due to Commercial Pesticides in Multan (2002) Pakistan Journal of Medcal Sciences, 18, pp. 227-231; Roberto, K., (2003) How-To Hydroponic, , 4 (Futuregarden); Sahare, V., Jain, P., Automated Hydroponic System using Psoc4 Prottyping Kit to Deliver Nutrients Solution Directly to Roots of Plants on Time Basis (2015) International Journal of Advanced Research in Electrical, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, 4, pp. 8765-8770; Mishra, R.I., Jain, P., Design and Implementation of Automatic Hydroponics System using ARM Processor (2015) International Journal of Advanced Research in Electrical, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, 4 (8), pp. 6935-6940; Umamaheswari, S., Preethi, A., Pravin, E., Dhanusha, R., Integrating Scheduled Hydroponic System IEEE International Conference on Advances in Computer Applications (ICACA), , (Coimbatore, India, 2016); Torres, A., Lopez, R.F., (2012) Measuring Daily Light Integral in A Greenhouse, , (Purdue); Olle, M., Viršile, A., The effect of light-emitting diode lighting on greenhouse plant growth and quality (2013) Agricultural and Food Science, 22, pp. 223-234; Massa, G.D., Kim, H.-H., Wheeler, R.M., Mitchell, C.A., Plant Productivity in Response to LED Ligthing (2008) HortScience, 43, pp. 1951-1956; Philips, (2014) Philips Ligth Recipes in Horticulture, , (Philips); (2017) Open Agriculture Initative (OpenAg), , https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/open-agriculture-openag/overview/, MIT Media Lab, [Online]; Li, Q., Yao, C., (2003) Real-Time Concepts for Embedded Systems, , R.-T.

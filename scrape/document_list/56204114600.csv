Wine fermentation is one of the oldest preservation methods, which has been applied mostly on fruits. The aims of this research were to study and compare the changes of physicochemical properties and antioxidant properties of different onion varieties (red, yellow, and white onions) during wine fermentation for 30 days. The result showed that fermentation rate of red onion was slower than other onions, expressed by alcohol content and pH of the wine produced. However, red onion had higher antioxidant capacities before and after fermentation than yellow and white onions from all three observed antioxidant capacities. After fermentation, there was increase in DPPH radical scavenging and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacities in all onion varieties. In addition, anthocyanin content of red onion decreased in large amount, however, it didn't impact the total flavonoid content. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Previous research on co-inoculation of Rhizopus oligosporus together with lactic acid bacteria in tempeh making showed promising results as lactic acid bacteria did not inhibit the growth of Rhizopus oligosporus. The aims of this study are to analyze the bioactivities (antioxidative and hepatoprotective activities) of single- and co-inoculated tempeh compared to pre-fermented soybean. Experiments was conducted by observing the effect of different lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus casei) on antioxidant capacities. Afterwards, one of lactic acid bacteria strain will be used to produce tempeh and the protective activity against di(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP)-injured FL83B cell was observed. The result showed that Lactobacillus plantarum co-inoculated tempeh had the highest ferrous ion chelating activity, while Lactobacillus casei co-inoculated tempeh had the highest radical scavenging acticity and reducing power. Moreover, genistein and daidzein, aglycone isoflavone, found highest in Lactobacillus bulgaricus co-inoculated tempeh. For hepatoprotective activity, Lactobacillus plantarum co-inoculated and single-inoculated tempeh had protective activities against DEHP-injured FL83B cell, while soybean has no significant protective effect. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of oligogalacturonides (OGA) and DDP on human lung cancer A549 cells. The combined use of OGA and DDP had a synergistic effect on the growth inhibition of A549 cells, changed the cell cycle distribution, and enhanced apoptotic response, especially in sequential combination treatment group of DDP 12 h + OGA 12 h. Western blot analyses showed that the combination treatment of OGA and DDP upregulated Bax, p53, and Caspase-3 and downregulated Bcl-2 proteins. More importantly, DDP-induced toxicity was attenuated by OGA and DDP combination treatment in normal HEK293 cells. Our data suggests that the combined use of OGA from natural sources and DDP could be an important new adjuvant therapy for lung cancer as well as offer important insights for reducing kidney toxicity of DDP and delaying the development of DDP resistance. © 2018 by the authors.

There is satisfactory information on established nutritive elements for various food groups. However, literature on anti-nutrient component generally scattered and scanty on few major food groups and commonly consumed plant parts. A better understanding of both the positive and negative qualities of vegetable component would help develop better evidence-based promotion and appropriate dietary strategies. This paper reviews seven types of anti-nutrient elements in vegetables: oxalates, phytates, nitrates, tannins, glucosinolates, saponins and alkaloids and their effects, mechanisms, content and processing methods. A total of 360 research papers were systematically identified and 123 were selected with acceptable anti-nutrient data. Vegetable families and plant parts with highest content of each anti-nutrient were identified, with the Leguiminosae family having highest content of phytate, tannins and saponins, and leafy vegetables having high oxalate. The simplest food processing methods to reduce anti-nutrients in vegetables are boiling and removal of certain plant parts. While consumption of vegetables with anti-nutrients do not normally cause adverse effects in the general population, future research to determine nutrient bioavailability based on diets will help increase awareness and improve recommendations on plant food intake. © CAB International 2018.","Alkaloids; Glucosinolates; Nitrate; Oxalate; Phytate; Review; Saponins; Tannins",,,,,,,"Hönow, R., Hesse, A., Comparison of extraction methods for the determination of soluble and total oxalate in foods by HPLC-enzyme-reactor (2002) Food Chemistry, 78 (4), pp. 511-521; Kasidas, G.P., Rose, G.A., Oxalate content of some common foods: Determination by an enzymatic method (1980) Journal of Human Nutrition, 34 (4), pp. 255-266; Marengo, S.R., Romani, A.M.P., Oxalate in renal stone disease: The terminal metabolite that just won't go away (2008) Nature Reviews Nephrology, 4 (7), p. 368; Gadd, G.M., Bahri-Esfahani, J., Li, Q., Rhee, Y.J., Wei, Z., Fomina, M., Oxalate production by fungi: Significance in geomycology biodeterioration and bioremediation (2014) Fungal Biology Reviews, 28 (2-3), pp. 36-55; Xu, H.W., Ji, X.M., He, Z.H., Shi, W.P., Zhu, G.H., Niu, J.K., Oxalate accumulation and regulation is independent of glycolate oxidase in rice leaves (2006) Journal of Experimental Botany, 57 (9), pp. 1899-1908; Santamaria, P., Elia, A., Serio, F., Todaro, E., A survey of nitrate and oxalate content in fresh vegetables (1999) Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 79 (13), pp. 1882-1888; Savage, G.P., Vanhanen, L., Mason, S.M., Ross, A.B., Effect of cooking on the soluble and insoluble oxalate content of some New Zealand foods (2000) Journal of Food Composition and Analysis, 13 (3), pp. 201-206; Gupta, S., Jyothi Lakshmi, A., Manjunath, M.N., Prakash, J., Analysis of nutrient and anti-nutrient content of underutilized green leafy vegetables (2005) LWT - Food Science Technology, 38 (4), pp. 339-345; Savage, G.P., Mårtensson, L., Comparison of the estimates of the oxalate content of taro leaves and corms and a selection of Indian vegetables following hot water, hot acid and in vitro extraction methods (2010) Journal of Food Composition and Analysis [Internet], 23 (1), pp. 113-117. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2009.07.001; Kumari, M., Gupta, S., Lakshmi, A.J., Prakash, J., Iron bioavailability in green leafy vegetables cooked in different utensils (2004) Food Chemistry, 86 (2), pp. 217-222; Siener, R., Hönow, R., Seidler, A., Voss, S., Hesse, A., Oxalate contents of species of the Polygonaceae, Amaranthaceae and Chenopodiaceae families (2006) Food Chemistry, 98 (2), pp. 220-224; Chai, W., Liebman, M., Effect of different cooking methods on vegetable oxalate content (2005) Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 53 (8), pp. 3027-3030; Jimidar, M., Hartmann, C., Cousement, N., Massart, D.L., Determination of nitrate and nitrite in vegetables by capillary electrophoresis with indirect detection (1995) Journal of Chromatography A [Internet], 706 (1-2), pp. 479-492. , http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/002196739401290U; Gupta, S., Gowri, B.S., Lakshmi, A.J., Prakash, J., Retention of nutrients in green leafy vegetables on dehydration (2013) Journal of Food Science and Technology, 50 (5), pp. 918-925; Judprasong, K., Charoenkiatkul, S., Sungpuag, P., Vasanachitt, K., Nakjamanong, Y., Total and soluble oxalate contents in Thai vegetables, cereal grains and legume seeds and their changes after cooking (2006) Journal of Food Composition and Analysis, 19 (4), pp. 340-347; Ejoh, R.A., Nkonga, D.V., Inocent, G., Moses, M.C., Nutritional components of some non-conventional leafy vegetables consumed in Cameroon (2007) Pakistan Journal of Nutrition, 6, pp. 712-717; Liebman, M., Doane, L., Calcium and zinc balances during consumption of high and low oxalate-containing vegetables (1989) Nutrition Research, 9 (9), pp. 947-955; Hatch, M., Freel, R.W., Intestinal transport of an obdurate anion: Oxalate (2005) Urological Research, 33 (1), pp. 1-16; Hughes, J., Norman, R.W., Diet and calcium stones (1992) Canadian Medical Association Journal, 146 (2), p. 137; Noonan, S.C., Savage, G.P., Oxalate content of foods and its effect on humans (1999) Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 8 (1), pp. 64-74; Hanes, D.A., Weaver, C.M., Heaney, R.P., Wastney, M., Absorption of calcium oxalate does not require dissociation in rats (1999) Journal of Nutrition, 129 (1), pp. 170-173; Chai, W., Liebman, M., Kynast-Gales, S., Massey, L., Oxalate absorption and endogenous oxalate synthesis from ascorbate in calcium oxalate stone formers and non-stone formers (2004) American Journal of Kidney Diseases, 44 (6), pp. 1060-1069; Gontzea, I., Sutzescu, P., (1968) Natural Antinutritive Substances in Foodstuffs and Forages, , New York: S Karger Basel; Concon, J.M., (1988) Food Toxicology.

The hepatoprotective effect of silymarin on DEHP-induced injury in FL83B mouse liver cells was investigated by analyzing the cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), cell cycle arrest, and cell morphology. The results revealed that cell viability decreased while released LDH and ALT increased with the increase of DEHP concentrations. Moreover, cell population of sub-G1 and S phase increased as the concentrations of DEHP increased. Silymarin at 25. μM achieved the highest hepatoprotective effect and exhibited 79% cell viability while only 46% cell viability was found in DEHP injured control. It was also found to reduce LDH release and cell populations of sub-G1 and S phase. Therefore, silymarin could ameliorate DEHP-induced injury and have potential to be further developed as a natural ingredient of health food against phthalate plasticizers induced liver injury. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate; FL83B cells; Hepatoprotective; Liver injury; Silymarin","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; lactate dehydrogenase; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; silymarin; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; lactate dehydrogenase; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; plasticizer; pollutant; protective agent; silymarin; animal cell; article; cell density; cell population; cell structure; cell viability; cellular distribution; concentration response; controlled study; drug effect; enzyme release; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; liver cell damage; liver protection; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; S phase cell cycle checkpoint; animal; cell cycle; cell line; cell survival; cytology; drug effects; Drug-Induced Liver Injury; liver; metabolism; pollutant; toxicity; Alanine Transaminase; Animals; Aspartate Aminotransferases; Cell Cycle; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Diethylhexyl Phthalate; Drug-Induced Liver Injury; Environmental Pollutants; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Liver; Mice; Plasticizers; Protective Agents; Silymarin",,"alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9; lactate dehydrogenase, 9001-60-9; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester, 117-81-7; silymarin, 65666-07-1; Alanine Transaminase; Aspartate Aminotransferases; Diethylhexyl Phthalate; Environmental Pollutants; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Plasticizers; Protective Agents; Silymarin",,,,"Abeer, A.K.M., Nermine, N., Mahmoud, S.K., Mona, K.T., Histological and electron microscopic study of the postulated protective role of green tea against DEHP liver toxicity in mice (2007) Afr.

However, the production of mead is time-consuming, and the process often takes several months to accomplish. During the elaboration of mead, sluggish and stuck fermentations often occur and lead to the production of undesirable flavours. To improve the condition of longan mead production in Taiwan, multiple yeast inoculations with different strains of yeast were examined in this study. The physicochemical properties and mead aroma compounds were measured. Longan mead without multiple inoculations, but with added yeast nutrients, displayed a sharp increase in ethanol content compared with the inoculated groups without yeast nutrients. However, the physicochemical properties of every mead reached almost the same endpoint at the end of the fermentation time (day 22). Moreover, differences among the groups were observed in their aroma compounds. Some aroma compounds, such as 2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-one, 1-propanol and 2-methylbutyl acetate, were only found in the double-inoculation groups, whereas other aroma compounds, such as phenethyl acetate and linalool, were only found in the single-yeast inoculation groups. These results demonstrate that multiple inoculations have a positive effect on longan mead fermentation. This technique could assist local producers in elaborating a longan mead of acceptable quality. © 2013 The Institute of Brewing & Distilling.","Longan honey; Mead; Multiple inoculations; Saccharomyces cerevisiae","Aroma compositions; Aroma compounds; Fermentation time; Longan honey; Mead; Multiple inoculations; Physicochemical property; Sharp increase; Fermentation; Food products; Nutrients; Odors; Volatile fatty acids; Yeast; Dimocarpus longan; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",,,,,,"Sroka, P., Tuszynski, T., Changes in organic acid contents during mead wort fermentation (2007) Food Chem., 104 (3), pp. 1250-1257; Wintersteen, C.L., Andrae, L.M., Engeseth, N.J., Effect of heat treatment on antioxidant capacity and flavour volatiles of mead (2005) J.

The increasing use of e-commerce today makes us wonder what kind of e-commerce model can satisfy customers. How about the trust of the business investors' view? Business investors are more likely cautious in making decisions. The managerial level in the Company also has a significant impact on e-commerce strategy. What trust factors influence customers' purchase intentions? This research was conducted to find a correlation between Trust and Loyalty in e-commerce with Purchase Intention. It is therefore known that the factors trust, and loyalty affect the increase in customers' Intention to buy. This research used Sequential Equation Modelling (SEM) to calculate the 107 data set of business investors as respondents at a business exhibition in Jakarta. Respondents were chosen using the Purposive Sampling Method. Data were analyzed model building by using Smart PLS 3.0. This research aims to know the impact of Trust to Purchase Intention of business investors as e-commerce users, to see the opportunity to sell the business to business investors. The result found that Trust to Purchase had a significant impact on Purchase Intention and found four indicators not valid nor reliable. © 2020 IEEE.","Business investors; Customer behavior; E-commerce; Purchase intention; Trust","Behavioral research; Customer satisfaction; Electronic commerce; Information management; Purchasing; Business to business; E-commerce model; E-commerce strategy; Intention to buies; Making decision; Purchase intention; Sampling method; Trust factor; Sales",,,,,"Mattison, F., Tuzovic, S., Braun, C., Trustmarks: Strategies for exploiting their full potential in e-commerce (2018) Bus.

Knowledge Management enables organizations to collect, store, distribute, and reuse the knowledge that a company's assets have. Likewise in the area of education, knowledge management has now evolved to be easier to deploy. Many colleges have tried to figure out how to use social computing to collaborate with educators and students in knowledge management. The most frequent problem of knowledge management is the willingness of the user to use or distribute it. The collaboration and communication aspects of social computing or web 2.0 is the basic successful use of knowledge management. The purpose of this study is to define and analyze how social computing can be utilized in knowledge management and implemented by the organization so that the purpose of knowledge management can be achieved.

Therefore, the use of knowledge should be managed and developed properly to produce maximum benefits, and to support the organisation's objectives. Although knowledge is considered important, many organisations in Indonesia still face many difficulties to measure and implement effective knowledge management (KM). Many corporations have reported major failures in adopting KM system. There is very few reference can be found especially for Indonesian corporations, to apply an effective KM that provides maximum benefits. The article examines the application of knowledge management system (KMS) in XYZ Co., a large IT service company, that serves major large corporations in Indonesia with the purpose to provide a reference of KMS application. The article adopts the successful KMS implementation based on the maturity level that was developed by Uday Kulkarni, Robert St. Louis, and Intel Corp. KMS maturity level has advantages in providing systematic thinking that commonly ignored by the Indonesian corporations. The KMS maturity model has been widely applied in major corporations and produced significant results. The article combines both KMS maturity model and 10-step KM roadmap developed by Armit Tiwana to maximize the output of KMS. The outcome of article is expected to be used as a reference for large corporation in Indonesia to apply KMS. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS","KM Maturity Model; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Management Maturity Level; Knowledge Management System",,,,,,"Tiwana, A., Williams, M., (2000) The Essential Guide to Knowledge Management:: E-Business and Crm Applications, , Prentice Hall PTR; Chigada, J., The role of knowledge management in enhancing organisational performance in selected banks of South Africa (2014) Information Science, , University of South Africa, Pretoria; Alavi, M., Leidner, D.E., Knowledge management and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Q, pp. 107-136; Foote, A., Halawi, L.A., Knowledge management models within information technology projects (2018) J.

Nowadays, NFC implementation usually concern in business transaction to replace conventional ways, such as cash and card transaction. But, NFC can be a good opportunity in education industry to support automated several education activities. Nowadays, most of Indonesian people already used Smartphone and familiar with NFC technology, but still don’t have opportunity to use NFC because there is no industry or transaction already use NFC tag in Indonesia. This paper discussed NFC design for education industry, especially for attendance system that can be one of university’s competitive advantages. NFC can support universities attendance system to make it simple and faster that can replaced conventional way. This study conducted by interview and observation at several universities in Jakarta to know about current attendance system mechanism, thus come up with new mechanism by using NFC technology. The conclusion is that NFC technology could be used to automate attendance system, make it faster and easy to use that can improve university’s academic operation performance. © IAEME Publication.","Attendance System; NFC; Universities",,,,,,"Pearson, K.E., Saunders, C.S., (2009) Strategic Management Information Systems, , Florida: John Willey & Sons, Inc, 2009; Ekbote, S., A robust student attendance monitoring system using NFC technology and biometrics (2015) International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication, pp. 5600-5603; Bekir Bilginer, P.-L.L., (2011) Near Field Communication, , Retrieved December 2014.Sweden: Lunds University; Anuj Yadav, A.S., Near field communication, an era of smart touch (2014) Journal of the International Association of Advanced Technology and Science, 15. , September 2014; Harsh Kotak, P.M., Automated car parking system with nfc access (2013) International Journal of Electronics and Communication Engineering & Technology (IJECET), p. 201; Vibhor Sharma, P.G., Near field communication (2013) Conference on Advances in Communication and Control Systems 2013 (CAC2S 2013), p. 343. , New Delhi, India: Atlantis Press; Muhammad Qasim Saeed, C.D., An attack on signed NFC records and some necessary revisions of NFC specifications (2012) International Journal for Information Security Research (IJISR), 2, p. 325; Ahmad, M.A., Touchin: An NFC supported attendance system in a university environment (2014) International Journal of Information and Education Technology, 4 (5), p. 449; Cavokian, A., Near field communications, keep it secure and private (2012) ISSA Journal, 13; Du, H., NFC technology: Today and tomorrow (2013) International Journal of Future Computer and Communication, 2 (4); Mohammad Awedh, A.M., Electronic attendance systems using NFC (2015) International Journal of Industrial Electronics and Electrical Engineering, 3 (9), pp. 30-32; Abhilash Bhise, R.K., Attendance system using NFC technology with embedded camera on mobile device (2015) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 4 (2), pp. 350-353; Elakiyaselvi, P., A framework for implementing e-attendance system uisng near field communication in android OS (2012) International Journal of Computer Technology & Applications, 3 (2), pp. 854-858; Kakani, V., Implementation of reliable attendence system using android and near field communication technology (2014) Global Journal of Engineering, Design, & Technology, pp. 5-10; More, V., Nayak, S., Attendance automation using near field communication (NFC) technology (2013) International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, pp. 572-575; Pampattiwar, S., Literature survey on NFC, Applications and controller (2012) International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, 3 (2)",,,,"IAEME Publication",,,,,09766340,,,,"English","Int.

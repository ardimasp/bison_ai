The task of integrating such system is quite complicated, especially the integration of the financial technology system. In addition to being integrated, the flow of data and business processes must effectively reach every part which has interests in the process and the data. Business productivity can be achieved if the required data flows smoothly and is accessible as efficient as possible. Similarly, a bank which usually uses more than one information systems, when it need to combine financial statements from different bank systems must go through a data transformation mechanism to be accessible. Especially if the users of some bank accounts must access all their banking accounts at one time, of course, this would not be easy. As a response to those situations, in this research we proposed a financial technology application integration based on SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) which could be used to combine financials statements of all integrated banks every month. The data required to create a composite report will be directly taken from the system of any bank by utilizing web services. It is expected that the results from this study could help the parties interested in SOA-based Fin Tech with the understanding and description of SOA, such as: how it works, its benefits, and the role of SOA layers implemented in Fin Tech applications. © 2018 IEEE.","Architecture; Fin Tech; SOA; System","Architecture; Citrus fruits; Finance; Fins (heat exchange); Information services; Integration; Metadata; Web services; Business productivity; Customer expectation; Fin Tech; Financial transactions; Soa (serviceoriented architecture); System; Technology application; Technology Integration; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,"Papazoglou, M.P., Georgakopoulos, D., Service oriented computing: Introduction (2003) Communications of the ACM, 46 (10), pp. 25-28; Meredith, L.G., Bjorg, S., Contracts and types (2003) Communications of the ACM, 46 (10), pp. 41-47; Arsanjani, A., (2004) Service-oriented Modeling and Architecture, p. 2; Josuttis Nicloai, M., SOA in practice (2007) O'Relly 2007, p. 210; Richard, B., (2005) Extensible Architectures: The Strategic Value of Service-oriented Architecture in Banking, , Department of Computer Information Systems, Robinson College of Business, Georgia State University; Bret, K., (2010) Bank 2.0: How Customer Behaviour and Technology Will Change the Future of Financial Services-Marshall Cavendish, , Business; Riad, A.M., Hassan, Q.F., Service-oriented architecture-A new alternative to traditional integration methods in B2B applications (2008) JCIT, 3 (1). , March 31, 2008; Papazoglou, M.P., Service-oriented computing: Concepts, characteristics, and directions (2003) Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE'03); Fajar, A.N., Legowo, N., Services modeling based on SOA and BPM for information system flexibility improvement (2018) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 8 (4), pp. 2451-2455; Fajar, A.N., Nurcahyo, A., Sriratnasari, S.R., SOA system architecture for interconnected modern higher education in Indonesia (2018) Procedia Computer Science the 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Computational Intelligence (ICCSCI 2018); 10 Best Android Budget Apps for Money Management, , https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-budget-apps-for-moneymanagement-586807/, Android Authority, 16-Jul-2018.

Research stages are done through literature based on End-User Computing Satisfaction (EUCS) satisfaction factor which consists of content, accuracy, timeless, ease of use and format. Questionnaires were developed based on each factor of EUCS and distributed to the user ie the students. Based on the formula Izaac and Michael the results of the sample calculation there are 380 students who become sample. Based on data from questionnaires that have been distributed validation test and reliability of 20 data responder first before further processing. The result of the questionnaire that has been collected is analyzed to the gap between expectation and reality to get user satisfaction on the use of LMS. After obtaining user satisfaction, it is done by Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach to determine what factors influence student's satisfaction by the factor on EUCS. The results show that users are not satisfied with all factors, and factor accuracy is the most important factor in determining user satisfaction, while the most important experience factor is timelines. The results of the open questionnaire, the user provides input for improvements to LMS related to access speed and feature addition and development of mobile-based LMS. © 2018 IEEE.","AHP; analytical hierachy process; end-user computing satisfaction; EUC; learning management systems; LMS","Hierarchical systems; Information management; Students; Surveys; Web browsers; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Ease-of-use; End user computing; Learning management system; Research stages; Student's satisfaction; User satisfaction; Validation test; Human computer interaction",,,,,"Watson, W.R., Watson, S.L., An argument for clarity: What are learning management systems, what are they not, and what should they become?

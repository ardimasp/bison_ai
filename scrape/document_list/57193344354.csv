This research will emphasize a traditional cloud pattern called Mega Mendung which has successfully become an iconic pattern from Cirebon, West Java. The purpose of this research is to detect the potential patterns of Mega Mendung that could potentially be applied as ornaments in the commercial space of the interior. There will also be some historical backgrounds of the Mega Mendung cloud and a pattern analysis of decoration in interior applications using the Goal Grid design thinking method, some expected results from these observations and analysis can provide information on 4 points: Achieve; things to get. Avoid; things to avoid. Preserve; things to be guarded and Eliminated; things that should be removed in the applications. At the end of the analysis this paper will remark on the goal and objectivity of using Mega Mendung pattern as an ornament and displayed within interior commercial space at Cirebon. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Physics; Cloud pattern; Grid design; Historical background; Icon designs; Interior designs; Pattern analysis; Public facilities; Train stations; Architectural design",,,,,"Yunus, U., Symbols of Cross Cultural Communication in Kasepuhan Palace Indonesia (2017) Cultura, 14 (1), pp. 171-176; Massey, J., (2013) Ornament and Decoration the Handbook of Interior Architecture and Design, pp. 497-636. , ed G B Weinthal (New York: bloomsbury); Ilmi, L., (2012) Makna Motif Mega Mendung Dan Wadasan Pada Keraton di Cirebon, , (Depok: Universitas Indonesia); Ross, L.M., (2016) The Encoded Cirebon Mask: Materiality, Flow, and Meaning Along Java's Islamic Northwest Coast, p. 187. , (The Netherlands: Brill Rodopi); Hann, M., (2013) Symbol, Pattern and Symmetry: The Cultural Significance of Structure, p. 249. , (New York: Bloomsbury); Curedale, R., (2013) Design Thinking Process and Methods Manual, , (Design community collage inc.); Nickols, F., (2015) The Goals Grid, , http://www.nickols.us/goals_grid.htm; Balik, D., Allmer, A., A critical review of ornament in contemporary architectural theory and practice (2016) ITU A|Z, 13, pp. 157-169; Setiawan, B., Ruki, U.A., Hendrassukma, D., Exploring Interior and Architectural Pattern of West Sumatra and Cirebon for Students Data References (2017) Advanced Science Letters, 23 (1), pp. 25-28",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Advance and Scientific Innovation, ICASI 2018","23 April 2018 through 24 April 2018",,148653,17426588,,,,"English","J.

Indonesia has a various number of local patterns, but the well-known pattern is usually printed on Indonesian textiles. The students have difficulties in creating new pattern influenced by Indonesian local pattern to be applied in their interior design project. In addition, they lack information about the meaning of local pattern from Indonesia. Therefore, they tend to avoid use pattern in their design or use it without any reference. This research collected and analyzed the pattern in interior and architectural building in Indonesia, starting from the east islands of Indonesia, city of Padang, West Sumatra; it continued to Java Island, started with the city of Cirebon, West Java. This Study adds new references for the students to learn about the originality of Indonesian pattern, especially finishing elements of interior and architectural. The result of this study is a list of the pattern from Padang and Cirebon, complete with its meaning and background influence. Indonesian pattern is influenced by the local culture philosophy and religion brought by the trader from Europe, Arabia, and surrounding Asia in the 18th century. Since then it has repeatedly been used in various building type. To conclude, a clear data about the history and meaning of ornaments can help to determine the correct placement of decoration. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Indonesia; Interior; Pattern",,,,,,"Roojen, P.V., (2006) Batik Design, , Batik Design.

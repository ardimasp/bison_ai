These physical cultures attracted not only the natives of the nations but also others globally. Within the progressive technology advancement, most of these distinctive martial arts have been captured truthfully within the 3D fighting games, embodied by the diverse cast of selectable fighters. The 3D graphics evolution along with the rapid development of gaming systems have made fighting games to be more easily and visibly perceptible in showing various fighting arts for the gaming communities. The researcher conducted this study to evaluate whether with this amount of experience and exposure of playing the hand-to-hand 3D fighting games - mainly Tekken series - have managed to draw the communities into learning certain martial arts in their life. Each of their personal interest is evaluated to see whether the games have influenced the communities in participating in a martial arts class. As a result, it was proven that most of the communities' martial arts interest have indeed influenced by playing fighting games experience, typically that fashioned real hand-to-hand combat such as Tekken meanwhile, others are mostly because of health, social and cultural interests. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Physics; 3D graphics; Gaming systems; Martial art; Physical culture; Technology advancement; Three dimensional computer graphics",,,,,"Parkin, S., (2014) An Illustrated History of 151 Video Games: A Detailed Guide to the Most Important Games: Explores Five Decades of Game Evolution, , (UK: Lorenz Book); Channon, A., Jennings, G., (2014) Exploring Embodiment Through Martial Arts and Combat Sports: A Review of Empirical Research Sport in Society, 17, pp. 773-789; Cynarski, W., Obodynski, K., Zeng, H., Martial Arts anthropology for sports pedagogy and physical education (2012) Rom.

Since this research is capitalized for constructing outputs based on gender identity stereotyping, King of Fighters XIV, the recent itinerary from SNK’s King of Fighters (KOF) series, is the best choice due to its almost equal numbers of male and female fighters to choose from as well as interestingly various characters’ storylines and designs. This study focuses on KOF XIV dialogues and cutscenes happening throughout the gameplay and how they can be utilized as references of gender identity stereotyping within creative writing process. There are equal numbers of male and female participants from Bina Nusantara University, aged 18 to 21 years old. Each of them is exposed to KOF series and then asked individually to construct a short story consisting three required main scenes; self-introduction, facing enemy and casual talk. This study hopefully enables to broaden the pedagogical and creative spectrum by adding video games, specifically fighting games, as one of the prominent tools of learning process, especially in the field of creative writing. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Furthermore, there have also been fewer studies on relating this phenomenon with neither the gaming culture nor its potential significance. For this research, the researcher utilizes an online survey consisting of randomly several iconic video games characters along with each given four references (from gaming culture perspective to common definitions) for the random online respondents to choose from. There are ten characters that are filtered into five highest frequency characters which are collectively filtered and then are analyzed comprehensively regarding the background of the character’s appearance and other potential reason of whether this paradigm has indeed influence the shifting in cultural allusion. In the spectrum of applied computing and culture, this study has proven that iconic video game characters, at least those who have been appearing in several titles or media, have the tendency to influence the shifting in cultural allusion within the gaming culture society, and in broader sense, the human culture as well. © 2018 ACM.","Allusion; Culture; DGBL; Video games characters","Cell culture; Computer games; Interactive computer graphics; Surveys; Allusion; Applied computing; DGBL; Frequency character; Human cultures; Online surveys; Video game; Human computer interaction",,,,,"Prensky, M., (2001) Digital Game-Based Learning, , United States: Paragon House; Rebetez, C., Betrancourt, M., Video game research in cognitive and educational sciences (2007) Cognition, Brain, and Behavior, 11 (1), pp. 131-142; Granic, I., Lobel, A., Engels, R.C.M.E., The benefits of playing video games (2014) American Psychologist, 69 (1), pp. 66-78; Bodnar, C., Clark, R., Davis, J., Congedo, T., Cole, D., Student perspectives on application of game-based learning within a graduate-level engineering course (2016) Proceeding – Frontiers in Education Conference.

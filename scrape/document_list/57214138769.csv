As Telecommunication 4.0 brings up new challenges and complexities created by open innovation and integrated hardware and software, there is a necessity to further demonstrate how organisations leverage networking with partners and exploit internal organisational structural flexibility to fully gain IPM decision-making quality and organisational agility. This study aims to explore how IPM decision-making quality and organisational agility are influenced by a business intelligence system with the capability of providing profound market knowledge and orchestrating the organisations' networking capabilities in leveraging external capabilities with internal factors embedded in a nimble organisational structure that subsequently influences decision-making accuracy. Furthermore, the relationship of antecedents-a business intelligence system, networking capability, and nimble organisational structure-is elaborated in our conceptual research model. Exploratory case studies with four telecommunication equipment companies in Indonesia and a literature review are used to examine the relationship between IPM decision-making quality antecedents. Deriving from information processing theory, dynamic capability, and resource-based theory, the originality of this study lies in how organisations exploit not only internal resources and flexible organisational structure, but also in how it accesses, configures, and leverages external network resources embedded in business partners to come up with full access to IPM decision-making quality in an open innovation era. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","agility; business intelligence; decision-making; Innovation portfolio management; networking capability; nimble organisational structure",,,,,,"Aghina, W., De Smet, A., Lackey, G., Lurie, M., Murarka, M., (2018) The 5 Trademarks of Agile Organisations, , https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organisation/our-insights/the-five-trademarks-of-agile-organisations, [Online].

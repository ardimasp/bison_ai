This kind of business offers a low limited loan amount for customer needs. The online loan business only verifies the current data of each customer for the user profiling process. Due to insufficient profile data of customers in person, the limit cannot go higher than it is now. But this business has the potential to grow and provide a better-customized loan amount according to each customer's financial conditions. The lack of customer data profile can be solved by integrating the data and loan system with big data. Big data offers a way to give online loan business a more accurate profiling system to track the customer financial history and many more. By having sufficient data of potential customers, the online loan companies can provide higher loan amounts to the customers based on their financial track. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

In the digital era, the use of mobile banking is a utility function for the need to perform daily financial activities such as bill payment and fund transfer. Addressing potential fraud in mobile banking services is a challenge for banks to make IT security systems remain confident, integrity, and available. Potential attacks on IT security will occur from the internal side of the organization as well as from external parties. In maintaining the level of security and convenience of customers in using e-banking services, banks try to make a tool to be able to prevent the occurrence of a large risk of loss in future. The most potential that will become an attack is social engineering and data theft by internal employees, in this research the focus is to discuss the two potential attacks on accounts that have long been dormant and deal with them with an application with the SOA approach. © 2019 IEEE.","application; fraud detection; Service Oriented Architecture (SOA); smart mobile","Applications; Electronic commerce; Information services; Security of data; Security systems; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Confidential data; Financial activity; Financial information; Fraud detection; Mobile applications; smart mobile; Social engineering; Utility functions; Crime",,,,,"King, B., (2010) Bank 2.0: How Customer Behavior and Technology Will Change the Future of Financial Services, , Banker (1st ed.).

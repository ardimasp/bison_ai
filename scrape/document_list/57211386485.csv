Many factors effect the decision to use cloud computing technology, and this study analyze the effect of ease of use, usefulness, cost effectiveness, and compatibility towards cloud computing usage in manufacturing company. This study analyze the correlation between each factors toward the usage of technology using Technology Acceptance Theory (TAM), Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI) using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and anova, a statistic method. The results of the study are ease of use, usefulness, cost effectiveness, and compatibility factors have effect and correlated to the usage of Cloud computing in manufacturing company. © BEIESP.","Cloud Computing; Compatibility; Cost Effectiveness; DOI; Ease of Use; TAM; Usefulness",,,,,,"Hayes, F., Frankly speaking: Complexity of server virtualization has to be dealt with fast but slowly (2008) Computer World.

Syahdan No. 9, Kemanggisan, Palmerah, Jakarta, 11480, Indonesia","Odd and even number plate recognition using deep learning is the important research in this 21st century because Jakarta imposed even and odd-numbered regulations in 2016 and there are still many that violate these regulations. This system can distinguish automatically odd and even the vehicle’s plate which is integrated with CCTV for electronic tickets. The methods are used in the approach for run length smearing algorithm, optical character recognition program, artificial neural networks backpropagation, and convolutional neural network techniques from deep learning with 3 × 3 and 4-layer filters. As a result of this system, the recognition of letters and numbers on the plate is still inaccurate. We display and evaluate approximately 90 percent accuracy of the experimental test.

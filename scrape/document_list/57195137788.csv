This paper describes an educational game application “Laut ABC”, which is an Android-based app that aims to be a learning tool with an attractive design that would help children learn alphabets. The results show that educational game app “Laut ABC” is a effective learning tool and can be used as an alternative for learning alphabets using an interesting and fun-learning concept. Design/methodology/approach: Research methods include methods of data collection, design and implementation. Data collection was done through research literature, interviews and questionnaires and analyzing some similar applications. Designing game application using storyboard and implementation was the done using the waterfall model for the software development life cycle. Findings: Most respondents stated that the introduction of alphabets is important for young children. They chose uppercase or capital letters to be used in the game. A majority of the respondents answered that the order of writing alphabets is important. These respondents agreed that educational games are a means for children to learn alphabets, as well as learn to write and pronounce alphabets. The application can also provide writing exercises to train childrens’ memory. The usual difficulties parents’ stated were that the children feel tired and are not in the mood to learn, have poor concentration, have difficulty in responding and seem to be disinclined to learn. Most of the parents mentioned that the critical points in children’s applications were the design of the educational application and completeness as a whole. Originality/value: The paper reports the development of game’s design —- display, navigation, instruction and feedback. It can be said that the users had no difficulty in playing the game. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Alphabet; Android; Educational; Educational games; Interactive games; Young children",,,,,,"(2012) Usia Emas (Golden Age) Bagi Anak, , http://bpplsp-reg5.go.id/catatan-156-id-usia-emas-golden-age-bagi-anak.html#, (accessed, 10 October 2013; Shamir, A., Korat, O., (2013) Technology as a Support for Literacy Achievements for Children at Risk, , (Eds) (, Springer Science + Business Media Dordrecht; Shneiderman, B., Plaisant, C., (2010) Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction, , 5th ed., Pearson Higher Education, Boston, MA; Sommerville, I., (2011) Software Engineering, , 9th ed., Pearson Higher Education, Boston, MA; Blades, M., Blumberg, F.C., Oates, C., The importance of digital games for children and young people (2013) Hogrefe Publishing: Zeitschrift fur Psychologie, 221 (2), pp. 65-66; Monk, M., McCrickard, D.S., Kadir, A., Dockery, B., Allen, K., Mobile technologies and its advantages with promoting healthy habits amongst children (2012) Springer-Verlag Berlin HeidelBerg, 374, pp. 192-196; Safaat, N., (2012) Android: Pemrograman Aplikasi Mobile Smartphone dan Tablet PC Berbasis Android, , Informatika, Bandung; Schell, J., (2008) The Art of Game Design A Book of Lenses, , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Burlington; Zemliansky, P., Mdan Wilcox, D., (2010) Design and Implementation of Educational Games: Theoretical and Practical Perspectives, , Information Science Reference, Hershey",,,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,07419058,,,,"English","Libr.

Film, as an audio visual media, depends largely on visual language to tell its story. The comprehension of the story relies on the understanding of the audience concerning the visual cues brought forth in the film. The understanding of visual language is made by a consensus between film maker and society in general. But what happens if the audiences are children? Could children understand the visual language in films? What happens if they don’t? With this research we are going to look at how film makers uses visual language to tell their story to children in Indonesia Children’s film.Why Indonesia Children’s Film? Because though the production of Indonesia’s film has pick up the pace significantly, Indonesian Children’s Film still stay stationary. The lack of children viewer that watches Indonesian Children’s Film is the reason for this condition. With this research, using semiotic method, we are going try to identify whether the lack of the usage of visual language in Indonesia Children’s Film is related to the lack of viewers acceptance to the film. © 2015 Taylor and Francis Group, London.",,"Behavioral research; Semiotics; Audio-visual media; Film-makers; Indonesia; Visual cues; Visual languages",,,,,"Allen, P., (2011) From the Mouths of Babes: Children in Recent Indonesian Film and Fictio, 13 (2). , http://puslit2.petra.ac.id/ejournal/index.php/ing/article/view/18378, K@ta, December 2011; Block, B., (2008) The Visual Story: Creating the Visual Structure of Film, TV and Digital Media, , 2nd edition.

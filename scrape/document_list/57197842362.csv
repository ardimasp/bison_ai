When it is older and no longer used, preservation needs to be done to keep its history. One way to preserves a heritage building through adaptive reuse, which also adds economic value to it. The historic Colomadu sugar factory built in Colomadu district area, near Solo city, Central Java, Indonesia, and then abandoned, now converted into a museum and amusement area named De Tjolomadoe. This adaptive reused tell histories and memories of the Sugar Factory's glorious past. The presence of this space is increasingly popular, in part because of the growing existence of social media. How the visitors of the museum interprets the functions of real space and virtual space, becomes the context discussed in this study. From the results of this study, we will find out how the visitors engaged in adaptive reuse of space which is associated with the visitor's needs of social media. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Social networking (online); Sugar factories; Sugar industry; Adaptive re use; Collective memory; Economic values; Heritage buildings; Indonesia; Real-space; Social media; Virtual spaces; Museums",,,,,,"Wasino, (2014) Modernisasi di Jantung Budaya Jawa, Mangkunegaran 1896-1944; Knight, G.R., The Sugar Industry of Colonial Java and its Global Trajectory (2000) South East Asia Research, 8 (3), pp. 213-238; Ardhiati, Y., (2018) De Tjolomadoe: Adaptive Reuse Bangunan Cagar Budaya; Bullen, P.A., Adaptive reuse and sustainability of commercial buildings (2007) Facilities, 25 (1-2), pp. 20-31; Conejos, S., Langston, C., Smith, J., Improving the Implementation of Adaptive Reuse Strategies for Historic Building (2011) Le Vie Dei Mercanti SAVE HERITAGE: Safeguard of Architectural, Visual, Environmental Heritage; Misirlisoy, D., Günçe, K., Adaptive reuse strategies for heritage buildings: A holistic approach (2016) Sustainable Cities and Society, 26, pp. 91-98; Shen, L.Y., Langston, C., Adaptive reuse potential: An Examination of differences between urban and non-urban project (2010) Facilities, 28 (1-2), pp. 6-16; Bloszies, C., (2012) Old Buildings, New Designs: Architectural Transformations; Wulandari, A.A.A., Fajarwati, A.A.S., Latif, F., The Relationship of Exhibition Space Design and the Success of Delivering Messages to Museum Visitors in Jakarta (2017) Humaniora, 8 (3), p. 219; Cetin, M., Filling an Urban Void as a 'Public Interior' in Balikesir; Contemporary Intervention into Historic Context through Interior Space (2017) A/Z: ITU Journal of Faculty of Architecture, 14, pp. 127-135; Watson, S., Waterton, E., Reading the Visual: Representation and Narrative in the Construction of Heritage (2010) Material Culture Review, 71; Murray, D.C., Notes to self: The visual culture of selfies in the age of social media (2015) Consumption Markets & Culture, 18 (6), pp. 490-516; Carr, D., Selfies on a Stick, and the Social-Content Challenge for the Media (2015) New York Times; Taylor, J., Gibson, L.K., Digitisation, digital interaction and social media: Embedded barriers to democratic heritage (2016) International Journal of Heritage Studies, 23 (5), pp. 408-420; Senft, T.M., Baym, N.K., What does the selfie say?

Sa'o as traditional house of Ngada people likewise has changed in interpretation and function. Through adaptive reuse, it became most popular approach in the earlier 21th century along with sustainability issue in architecture. Altering the interior spaces can achieve the conception of adaptive reuse which creates sustainability. This concept is related to culture, economic, and environmental aspect.

Many efforts were made to reduce the load of this waste. However, the high demand of residences in metropolitan makes the waste problem needs to be solved together. Based on this problem, author chooses Omah, - a Javanese traditional house, which is built, based on the traditional system of life of Javanese people - displacement from rural to urban area as the alternative solution, as it uses selected materials from nature by considering the sustainability and preservation for future generation. The wooden building is built based on traditional construction system that follows Javanese principles and traditional calculation, based on philosophy and cosmology in the community. This paper will covers utilization of Omah in urban area as an implementation of green design, which refers to the concepts of reuse, reduce, recycle and responsibility. Through expert interviews and field surveys in urban and rural areas, author collected data needed for this paper. Although the functionality of the building is different from rural to urban requirements, the phenomenon of Omah displacement from Javanese habitat to urban living area is well accepted and becomes an interesting trend. © 2017 Author(s).",,,,,,,,"Wang, J.Y., Kang, X.P., Tam, V.W.Y., (2008) Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology, 6, pp. 227-236; Yuan, H., (2012) Waste Management, 32, pp. 1218-1228; Nagapan, S., Rahman, I.A., Asmi, A., Memon, A.H., Latif, I., (2012) CHUSER 2012 - 2012 IEEE Colloquium on Humanities, Science and Engineering Research, pp. 325-330; Ching, F.D., Shapiro, I.M., (2014) Green Building Illustrated, , (Wiley & Sons Inc, Hoboken); Kibert, C.J., (2016) Sustainable Construction: Green Building Design and Delivery, , Fourth Edition (4th Ed.)

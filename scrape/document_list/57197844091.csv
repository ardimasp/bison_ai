Concerning this issue, the Green Building Council Indonesia provides standard criteria for greenhouses. Nevertheless, eco-friendly homes' users are still not familiar with the application of these criteria. Therefore, this research aims to investigate the users' perception of eco-friendly homes' energy efficiency. The study was conducted in Surabaya and Malang, using a cross-sectional survey method by distributing questionnaires; 200 respondents participated in the study. After the descriptive analysis, it was revealed that most of the respondents had the same perception regarding the importance of energy efficiency in their homes. According to the results, the criteria of water conservation, under the sub-criteria of using fittings for water-saving, shows the highest mean value; so, it can be concluded that the respondents prioritize the household water use efficiency more than other types of energy. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.","Eco-friendly residence; Greenship; Household perception; Water conservation; Water efficiency","Environmental protection; Surveys; Water conservation; Cross-sectional surveys; Descriptive analysis; Eco-friendly; Green Building Council; Household water; Mean values; Users' perception; Water - savings; Energy efficiency",,,,,"Tharakan, P., (2015) Summary of Indonesia's Energy Sector Assessment., p. 40. , https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/178039/ino-paper-09-2015.pdf, P.

Cash flow shortage often interrupts business development. This difficulty is due to the limited ability in meeting the requirements to access sources of capital. The development of micro and small enterprises using the culture of the local community is a way to overcome this issue. Asians generally have the perception of Gotong Royong (which means 'mutual aid' in English) as a form of collectivism. This study comes from the gap whether Gotong Royong serves as social capital to overcome the difficulties of micro and small enterprises’ capital. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to find out the perception of owners of MSEs toward the application of Gotong Royong culture, which suggests how to overcome the business capital difficulties in reality. The qualitative method was applied to investigate the informants with triangulation process to validate the result accuracy. The results of this study show that MSEs owners build their businesses with the family culture, which upholds a Gotong Royong character. Small: based on the field data processing, the second result reveals that the social capital of the community in the form of Gotong Royong culture could overcome capital constraints in micro and small enterprises. Similarly, the Gotong Royong culture applied in business could reduce the capital requirement that should be prepared by micro and small entrepreneurs. The contribution of this research is for business owners so that they do not lose the character of mutual cooperation and to provide input for the government to support family businesses that still rely on these characters by giving light funding assistance. However, this research must be developed further in a broader business scale with different informant profiles so that the results will be more comprehensive. © 2020 The Author(s)","Capital; Gotong Royong; Management; MSEs; Research and development; Social capital; Social networks; Social policy; Sustainable business",,,,,,"Adab, G., Wiyarto, A., Primastito, Z., Manut - decision making culture in java (2012) Prosiding Seminar Nasional Psikologi Islami, pp. 108-115; Arasti, Z., Fakhrisadat, N., Imanipour, N., Explaining the role of managerial skills of entrepreneurship in business success (2014) Int.

The study population was consumers purchasing fashion products at Ramayana Mall Salatiga. This study used the non-probability sampling technique with purposive sampling of 130 respondents. The analysis employed the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique. The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used as a validity test; the result was valid because the estimated value was > 0.05. The Cronbach's alpha was used as a reliability test; the result was reliable because the CR was > 0.60. Hypothesis testing with regression weights indicates that hedonic shopping value affects positive emotion with a CR value of 5.514 and a p-value of 0.000. Moreover, hedonic shopping value affects impulse buying with a CR value of 5.504 and a p-value of 0.000. A positive emotion effect was found on impulse buying with a CR value of 3.307 and a p-value of 0.002. Hedonic shopping value indirectly affects impulse buying through positive emotion; it was obtained that IE > DE (0.845 > 0.037). Ramayana Mall should offer the latest fashion products, provide discounts on certain fashion products, and create an attractive store atmosphere so that shopping will be enjoyable for consumers. © 2020 IJSTR.","Buying; Emotion; Hedonic; Impulse; Positive; Shopping; Value",,,,,,"Foedjiawati, S.H., “Pengaruh Kepuasan Konsumen Terhadap Kesetiaan Merek (Studi Kasus Restoran The Prime Steak & Ribs Surabaya)” (2005) Jurnal Manajemen & Kewirausahaan., 7. , Vol tahun 2003, Surabaya: UKP Surabaya; Irani, N., Hanzaee, K.H., The Effect of Variety-seeking Buying Tendency and Price Sensitivity on Utilitarian and Hedonic Value in Apparel Shopping Satisfaction (2011) International Journal of Marketing Studies, 3 (3), pp. 89-103; Peter., J., Olson, P.J.C., (2013) Consumer Behavior: Perilaku Konsumen Dan Strategi Pemasaran, , Jilid 2.

The factors of customer loyalty creation need to be known by marketers. This study aims to analyse the role of satisfaction as moderation to the effect of relational marketing and customer value on customer loyalty. This is a survey research. The population is traditional food stall consumers. Research like this has never been done, especially in the micro business segment, which is run traditionally. A total of 100 samples are selected by purposive random sampling. Data is collected by interviews, observations and questionnaires. The data is analysed by SEM (structural equation modelling) with AMOS 20. The results show that relational marketing, customer value, and satisfaction affect customer loyalty. Satisfaction does not moderate the effect of relational marketing and customer value on customer loyalty. This means that satisfied consumers are not directly loyal; there are other variables of consumer behaviour that also effect customer loyalty. Traditional stalls should provide a suggestion box to receive complaints and advice from consumers, as well as new menus that are not yet available, to improve service quality. © 2020 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Customer value; Loyalty; Relational marketing; Satisfaction; Stalls",,,,,,"Abdullah, F., Managing Customer Preference for the Foodservice Industry (2011) International Journal of Innovation, Management and Technology, Vol, 2 (6), pp. 525-533; Aryani, D.F.R., Pengaruh Kualitas Layanan terhadap Kepuasan Pelanggan dalam Membentuk Loyalitas Pelanggan, Bisnis & Birokrasi (2010) Jurnal Ilmu Administrasi dan Organisasi, 1 (1), pp. 114-126; Basamalah, F.M., Pengaruh Komunitas Merek terhadap Word of Mouth, Bisnis & Birokrasi (2010) JurnalIlmu Administrasi dan Organisasi, 17 (1), pp. 79-89; Belleau, B., Summers, T., Xu, Y., Pinel, R., Theory of Reasoned Action Purchase Intention of Young Consumers (2007) Clothes, Textiles Res.

Research objects are community members of micro and small enterprises, while Informants in this study amounted to five people consisting of two micro entrepreneurs and 3 three small entrepreneurs. The research analysis tool used is Phenomenology. The results of this study indicate that the interaction of micro and small business community members through WhatsApp group is very dynamic. The networking that occurs among community members is not only a common friendship but also sharing of business information, business transactions, and business partnerships. Community members feel very helpful in doing business with the community existance. Many members increase their sales turnover because they are actively involved in WhatsApp group. This is because trough WhatsApp group, the community members can promote their products and/or services freely. Furthermore, information sharing is regularly done through WhatsApp groups, such as business plan preparation training, exhibition activities, access to cheap and quality raw materials, potential business opportunities, financial governance, and business legality management. Hence, community can bridge connectivity among members, resulting in a growing sense of togetherness and loyalty among them. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

Traditional society is a group which needs special attention since not all government’s development programmes can be implemented and are suitable. Traditional society has its own experience in developing business such as the patron-client relationship. The patron-client relationship is one of the existing cultural heritages. Amidst views which considers the relationship exploitative, the pattern is still spreading in traditional society. This study shows that patron-client relationship is the best choice for traditional society since it does not erase their culture.

Substantively, the informal workers are disinclined to be bound as permanent employees which different from the general labor paradigm. Hence, the objective of this study is to find out how the labour selection process, the factors that affected their performance, and the suitable wage system to achieve the target completion of housing construction project. The qualitative method is used to uncover and understand the meaning behind the phenomena (numina) of informal workers action and their influence on housing construction project which called phenomenological approach. Five informal workers and two project managers were selected as informants based on predetermined criteria with in-depth interviews. The results showed that the informal worker were more satisfied with the wage based on unit price while working in the housing construction project for the flexibility in working hours. In addition, the developer was also relieved because they only control the quality and the achievement of the project completion time which supported by informal worker leader. Therefore, these findings are beneficial for both of developer and government as policy maker to succeed the housing program in Indonesia. © 2017 Author(s).",,,,,,,"(2017) Data Perumahan BPS Harus Dijadikan Acuan, , Departemen Pekerjaan Umum; Gray, C.F., Larson, E.W., (2006) Project Management: The Managerial Process, , (The Mac Graw Hill Companies, Inc.); Lukiyanto, K., Setiawan, M., Troena, E.A., Noermijati, (2015) Australian Journal of Basic and Applied Sciences, 9, pp. 191-197; Jackson, T., (2013) Management International Review, 53 (1), pp. 13-38; Kreiser, P., Marino, L., Weaver, K.M., (2005) University of Alabam, , Department of Management and Marketing; Jha, K.K., (2002) International Labour Organization Sectoral Activities Programme, 187. , Working Paper; Jason, A., (2007) ILO Publication, International Labor Office, 22. , Ch-1221 Jeneva; Saxena, S., (2009) International Research Journal, 2 (7); Irawanto, D.W., Journal of Diversity Management - Second Quarter, 4 (2), p. 2009; Adi, H.P., Ni'Am, N.F., (2012) International Journal of Civil and Structural Engineering, 3 (1); Tabassi, A.A., Bakar, A.H.A., (2009) International Journal of Project Management, 27, pp. 471-480; Soemardi, B.W., Soenaryo, I., Wahyudi, E., (2011) Procedia Engineering, 14, pp. 859-864; Messah, Y.A., Widodo, T., Adoe, M.L., (2013) Jurnal Teknik Sipil, 2 (2), pp. 157-168; Tjakra, J., Sangari, F., (2011) Jurnal Ilmiah Media Engineering, 1 (1), pp. 29-37; Khoramshahi, F., Dehghan, R., Mortaheb, M.M., (2006) The 10th East Asia-Pacific Conference on Structural Engineering and Construction; Yang, L., (2011) Procedia Engineering, 15, pp. 5595-5597; Sjahrir, K., (1991) ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; Soekiman, A., Pribadi, K.S., Soemardi, B.W., Wirahadikusumah, R.D., (2011) International Journal of Engineering, Annals of Faculty Engineering Hunedoara-Tome, IX Fascicule, 3; Creswell, J., Plano Clark, V., (2007), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Corbin, J., Strauss, A., (2008), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Karami, A., Rowley, J., Analoui, F., (2006) International Journal, 23 (1), pp. 43-52; Denzin Norman, K., Lincoln, Y.S., (2009), Sage Publications Inc; Creswell, J.W., (2008), Sage Publications Inc; Newman, I., Benz, C., Carbondale, R., (2003), Edwardsville University Press; Hofstede, G., (1980), Sage Publications Inc","Wijayaningtyas, M.; Civil Engineering Post-Graduate Program, Indonesia; email: maranatha.wijaya@gmail.com","Borgan W.R.SalomaVictorBuntoro F.","","American Institute of Physics Inc.","3rd International Conference on Construction and Building Engineering: Smart Construction Towards Global Challenges, ICONBUILD 2017","14 August 2017 through 17 August 2017",,132045,0094243X,9780735415911,,,"English","AIP Conf.

This condition can turn the traffic into motorcycle-dominated flow on several roads where the proportion of motorcycle is significantly higher than other vehicle. The purpose of this research is to analyze and determine the value of motorcycle unit (MCU) with effective space approach rather than using passenger car unit (PCU). This research tried to relate between vehicle speed and vehicle effective space, for each type of vehicle. This research was conducted on Jalan Raya Lenteng Agung Barat and Teuku Nyak Arief Street, South Jakarta, for four days from 07.00 am to 11.00 pm. The results of this study indicate that there is a very strong relationship between speed and effective space with the value of R2 more than 0.9. MCU values for motorcycles is 1.0, for light vehicles is 2.04, and heavy vehicles is 2.64. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

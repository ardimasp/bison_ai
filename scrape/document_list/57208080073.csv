On the other hand, automatic text summarization is considered as a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) problem for satisfying two conflicting objectives. Retaining the information from the source of text as much as possible and producing the summary length as short as possible. To solve that problem, an undirected graph is created to construct the relation between social media comments. Then, the Multi-Objective Ant Colony Optimization (MOACO) algorithm is applied to generate summaries by selecting concise and important comments from the graph based on the desired summary size. The quality of generated summaries is compared to other text summarization algorithms such as TextRank, LexRank, SumBasic, Latent Semantic Analysis, and KL-Sum. The result showed that MOACO can produce informative and concise summaries which have small cosine distance to the source text and fewer number of words compared to the other algorithms. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.","Ant colony optimization;

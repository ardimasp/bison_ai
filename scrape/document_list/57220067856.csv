Traditional attendance by using handwritten signatures has proven to be very inefficient due to its challenging instances of time-consuming, falsifications, impersonations and miscalculations. In addition to the traditional way, among other approaches used for recording attendance, biometric technique is the one attendance method. Using biometric attendance, such as fingerprint, voice, and face will be simplify the process of attendance, and employee does not need to sign on attendance sheets every day. This technique is more efficient and saves times than traditional way. This paper proposed a face recognition as biometric attendance system using deep learning method. The entire process of developing a face recognition model will be described in detail. This face recognition model is composed of several essential steps using the most advanced technique: Multitask Convolutional Neural Network (MTCNN) for face detection and FaceNet for embeddings – verification process to recognize face. This goal must be met as a result of the attendance system, and every condition must be concerned to return the valid and accurate result. This model will gather the face image of the employee and will return 128-d embedded vectors. Thus, result of the attendance process will be stored to excel sheet and the system will automatically mark the attendance once employee is detected by camera. After implementing the model, overall accuracy was 95% on a small dataset of the original face images of employees in the real-time environment.

It provides a comprehensive completion approach and gives total confidence to asset owner to operate the facility handed over by construction contractors. While the nature variation of asset hierarchy is unique from one type of asset to another, a project completion software must have prominent ability to adapt wide range of variations with unlimited level of hierarchy. One of the approaches to overcome this is implementing a tree-model concept to accommodate flexible hierarchy. Unfortunately, the package is loaded with complexity to retrieve data and takes longer join operation. This paper proposes a business intelligence approach to analyze and make an optimum reporting retrieval using data warehouse. This is implemented in 4 steps following Kimball methods. The objective of this paper is to generate model by using data warehouse starting the extract, transform and load process on the flexible tree model hierarchy. It can be used to generate report and comprehensive dashboard especially progress report of project and work schedule as needed in the oil and gas and construction industry. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

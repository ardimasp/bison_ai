It is used not only to link to their friends but also to obtain information. However, the rapid development of Facebook use has not only a positive impact but also a negative one. One that should be a concern is that the truth of the information posted in Facebook is not always accountable. Several users are likely to trust the information posted even though it is not reliable. As a result, it is not uncommon that the information on Facebook can actually make the disintegration on the nation. Therefore, this study is conducted to describe how Facebook can be used by young people to make Indonesian nation more integrated. The informants are nine students of Bina Nusantara University who are selected randomly. The data are collected using interview technique based on nine relevant questions. Then the data are analyzed using the theory of Uses and Gratifications. The results show that social media such as Facebook can be used by university students as a tool to maintain and develop Indonesian's national integration. They can also manage not to allow such media to make the nation disintegrated. This result implies that when social media is used wisely and positively, it supports the nation for sustainable integration. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Disintegration; Integration; Students; Facebook; Indonesia; It supports; Social media; Sustainable integrations; University students; Uses and gratifications; Young peoples; Social networking (online)",,,,,,"Yusuf, O., (2016), Hampir Semua Pengguna Internet Indonesia Memakai Facebook Online Tekno.com; Zakaria, I., (2015), Remaja Indonesia Makin Tergantung Dengan Facebook Ketika Liburan Online Tekno.com; Basilisco, R., Cha, K.J., Uses and gratification motivation for using facebook and the impact of facebook usage on social capital and life satisfaction among filipino users (2015) International Journal of Software Engineering and Its Applications, 9, pp. 181-194; Sianipar, A.P., Pemanfaatan youtube di kalangan mahasiswa (2013) USU, 2; Ha, Y.W., Kim, J., Libaque-Saenz, C.F., Chang, Y., Park, M.C., Use and gratifications of mobile sns: Facebook and kakaotalk in korea (2014) Telematics and Informatics, 32 (3), pp. 425-438; Irianto, A.M., Integrasi nasional sebagai penangkal etnosentrisme di indonesia (2013) Humanika, 18, pp. 1-9; Haryono, B., Sulistyo, E.T., Zuber, A., Model pendidikan partisispatif empat pilar bangsa bagi integrasi nasional (2013) Komunitas, 5, pp. 240-251",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Advance and Scientific Innovation, ICASI 2018","23 April 2018 through 24 April 2018",,148653,17426588,,,,"English","J.

In Jakarta, Indonesia, for example, this use can be seen in advertisements, headlines, brochures, even the street hawkers. The word snake replacing snack in front of a shop shows that the society is actually aware of the importance of English. The paper analyzes the use of real English found in the society in order to find out how far the English used follows the standard and the possible causes of the non standard expressions. The data were taken from 20 writings consisting of advertisements, boards, and notices from the public places. They were analyzed qualitatively in terms of the phonology, vocabulary, grammar and meaning. The results show that the non-standard use of real English is found in spelling, vocabulary, word choice, and grammar. The causes are the influence of Indonesian or the local language, lack of vocabulary, the use of Indonesian grammar, and the writing of words which is based on what is heard. Some expressions can be understood directly but some others cannot be understood at all. The results of this research can be used by the lecturers as the input to design the curriculum of English for society as their community service. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Grammar; Meaning; Real English; Vocabulary",,,,,"Binus University","We thank you Bina Nusantara University which supported us in conducting this research.","Brumfitt, C.J., (2001) Individual Freedom in Language Teaching: Helping Learners to Develop a Dialect of Their Own, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Seidlhofer, B., A Concept of International English and Related Issues: From ‘Real English’ to ‘Realistic English’?

On the other hand, the public oftentimes is surprised to get their position as a victim in doing something that is common in cyber space. Discrepancy between public perspective and law perspective created tension between the public and law enforcement. Gap of understanding within cyber space concept is because sometimes the law is difficult to catch the dynamic phenomenon in cyber space that shifts in very fast way with many convergence concepts. By the convergency principle in cyber space, this paper tries to discuss from the science of communication. In digital media, communication role is very important, because in cyber space of the backbone concept is communication, and one of the concepts of digital communication is digital proxemics that will be explored with literature review method. This paper found that proxemics concept can determine the scope of personal data protection from privacy and the distribution of information. © 2021 ICIC International","Cyber law; Cyber space; Cybercrime; Digital communication; Digital media; Digital proxemics",,,,,,,"Das, S., Nayak, T., Impact of cyber crime: Issues and challenges (2013) Int.

To pursue IPR growth, triple helix component becomes a backbone to weave academia, business and government to collaborate with each other. Generally, collaborations move from their common interest, but within triple helix the collaboration can be run structurally and sustain. Depart from the arguments; the question arises: How is the condition of Indonesia Innovation System? Through legal approach, this paper will explain current legal condition and legal structure of the Indonesian innovation system. The reason to review the law is to relate with the government's target to create 1000 digital start-ups alike as in Silicon Valley level size. Therefore, legal framework review becomes useful to explain the condition of the law as a supporting system. In this sense, the legal prescription can be generated to confirm Indonesian laws, whether supported the national innovation system or conversely. Within law perspective, Indonesian government categorizes the innovative industry as a creative industry. However, there is still no resolute concept to follow. Therefore, some of law adjustment is needed to support the government's plan to pursue commercialized innovation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Intellectual property; Sustainable development; Common interests; Creative industries; Innovation system; Intellectual property rights; Legal condition; Legal frameworks; National innovation systems; Supporting systems; Laws and legislation",,,,,,"Pardo, T.A., Smart City as Urban Innovation: Focusing on Management, Policy, and Context (2011) ICEGOF, , (Estonia: Tallinn); https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/Smart%20City%20Challenge%20Lessons%20Learned.pdf, U D o.

Mostly the claim based of IT utilization for their governance. In general, a smart city definition is to describe a developed urban area that creates sustainable economic development and high quality of life by excelling in multiple key; economy, mobility, environment, people, living, and government. For public services, the law guarantees good governance by setting the standard for e-government implicitly including for local government or a city. Based on the arguments, this research tries to test the condition of e-government of the Indonesian city in 34 provinces. The purpose is to map e-government condition by measuring indicators of smart government, which are: transparent governance and open data for the public. This research is departing from public information disclosure law and to correspond with the existence law. By examining government transparency, the output of the research can be used to measure the effectiveness of public information disclosure law and to determine the condition of e-government in local government in which as part of a smart city. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Economics; Smart city; Sustainable development; E-governments; Good governances; IT utilizations; Local government; Public information; Public services; Smart governments; Sustainable economic development; Government data processing",,,,,,"Albino Vito, A.B.U.R.M.D., Smart Cities: Definition, Dimension, Performance, and Initiatives (2015) Urban Technology, 22 (1), pp. 3-21; Bosek, L., (2017) Information Sharing, Transparency, and E-Governance among County Government Office in Southeastern Michigan, p. 128; Colldahl Caroline, A.F.S.J.E.K., (2013) Smart Cities: Strategic Sustainable Development for An Urban World, p. 9. , (Blekinge Institute of Technology); Bill Collins, A.R.J.P.G.C.W., E-Governance and Smart Communities: A Social Learning Challenge (2002) SSHRC Knowledge Based Economy; Driss, K., Good Governance and E-Government: Applying a Formal Outcome Analysis Methodology in Developing World Cintect (2009) International Journal Electronic Governance, 2, pp. 23-54; Rudolp Giffinger, C.F.H., (2007) Smart Cities: Rangking of European Medium-Sized Cities, , (Vienna); Elahi, K.Q.-I., UNDP on Good Governance (2009) International Journal of Social Economics, 36 (12), pp. 1167-1180; Haji, H.S., An Introduction on Literature of Smart City Civil Engineering and Urban Planning: An International Journal (CiVEJ), p. 10. , December 2016; Graham John, A.A.B.T.P., (2003) Principles for Good Governance in the 21st Century, , (Ottawa); Internet, A.J.P.J., Saatnya Jadi Pokok Perhatian Pemerintah Dan Industri, , https://apjii.or.id/downfile/file/BULETINAPJIIEDISI05November2016.pdf, Monday November 2016 [Accessed 10 July 2017]; Nalle, V.I.W., The Relevance of Socio-Legal Studies in Legal Science (2015) Mimbar Hukum, 27 (1), p. 179. , 182; Irianto, S., (2012) Kajian Sosio-Legal, 1, pp. 1-4. , Irianto S. ed S.

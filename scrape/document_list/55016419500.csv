This paper proposes data warehouse for supporting business in XYZ hotel to get better information about customers data of each branches for taking decision. The data warehouse development consists nine step methodology designed by Kimball and Ross. Furthermore, the data is able to be presented in dashboard or report corresponding to the user to simplify the data presentation, The data warehouse is used to integrate the data sources needed to provide quick and accurate information. © 2017 IEEE.","Booking system; Data Warehouse; Decision Support System; Hotel","Artificial intelligence; Data warehouses; Hotels; Reservation systems; Booking systems; Business development; Data presentation; Data warehouse development; Data-sources; Indonesia; Decision support systems",,,,,"Hansen, M.C., Krylov, A., Tyukavina, A., International Conference on Recent Trends in Physics 2016 (ICRTP2016) (2016) J.

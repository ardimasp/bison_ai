The aim of this research is to evaluate the implementation of IT Governance in Telecommunication Industries focuses mainly on the EDM and DSS domains based on the COBIT 5 and ISO 38500 frameworks. We have conducted an evaluation research and conducting collection of primary and secondary data. The data that we have compiled from questionnaires result were divided into 2 parts; Domain EDM questionnaires and Domain DSS questionnaires. The results of our evaluation from the Telecommunication Industries shows that the EDM Domain scored 4, 2 with the rating scale of 76%. Whereas the capability level for Domain DSS reached 4, 33 with the rating scale of 82%. In conclusion, our research as well as the evaluation that we have conducted on IT Governance implementation within Telecommunication Industries could be categorized as 'satisfactory. © 2020 IEEE.","COBIT 5; DSS; EDM; ISO 38500; IT governance implementation","Information management; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Surveys; Evaluation research; IT governance; Rating scale; Secondary datum; Telecommunication industry",,,,,"Witjaksono, R.W., Audit sistem informasi akademik universitas telkom menggunakan framework cobit 5 domain dss untuk optimasi proses service delivery (2019) Jurnal Rekayasa Sistem & Industri (JRSI), 6 (1); Juiz, C., Guerrero, C., Lera, I., Implementing good governance principles for the public sector in information technology governance frameworks (2014) Open Journal of Accounting, 3 (1), pp. 9-27; El Ghorfi, R., El Aroussi, M., Ouadou, M., Aboutajdine, D., Valuating it governance strategies with real options in a decision making framework (2018) International Journal of Information Systems in the Service Sector (IJISSS), 10 (4), pp. 42-58; Razak, R.A., Zakaria, M.S., The information and communication technology governance maturity level for Malaysian public sector (2017) Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Internet of Things, Data and Cloud Computing; (2005) Governance-Developing A Successful Governance Strategy: A Best Practice Guide for Decision Makers in IT, , NCC, I, John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated; Saputra, F.H., Perancangan tata kelola teknologi informasi menggunakan kerangka kerja cobit pada pt. biro klasifikasi Indonesia makassar. inspiration (2019) Jurnal Teknologi Informasi Dan Komunikasi, 9 (1), pp. 81-88; Selviyanti, E., Sardjono, W., Measuring maturity level of information technology governance at the television broadcasting company (2020) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1538 (1), p. 012045; C. 5: A business framework for the governance and management of enterprise it (2012) ISACA, , ISACA, Rolling Meadows, USA; Darenoh, M.P., Manuputty, A.D., Surachman, F., Evaluasi tingkat kapabilitas kinerja layanan ti pada layanan internet bidang a menggunakan framework cobit 5 domain mea 01 (studi kasus: Satuan organisasi xyz-lembaga abc) (2018) Jurnal Teknik Informatika Dan Sistem Informasi, 4 (1), pp. 58-66; Holt, A.L., (2013) Governance of IT: An Executive Guide to ISO/IEC 38500, , BCS Learning & Development Limited; Iso/iec standard published for governance of information technology Government Technology State & Local Articles-e.

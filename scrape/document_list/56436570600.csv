Two-echelon distribution systems are attractive from an economic standpoint, whereas the product from the depot can be distributed from or to intermediate facilities. In this case, the intermediate facilities are considered as locker facilities present in an accessible location in the vicinity of the final customers. In addition, the utilization of locker facilities can reduce the cost caused by the unattended deliveries. The problem is addressed as an optimization model that formulated into an integer linear programming model denoted as the two-echelon vehicle routing problem with locker facilities (2EVRP-LF). The objective is to minimize the cost of transportation with regards to the vehicle travelling cost, the intermediate facilities renting cost, and the additional cost to compensate the customer that needs to travel to access the intermediate facilities. Because of its complexity, a simulated annealing algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. On the other hand, the modelling approach can be conducted by generating two-phase optimization model approaches, which are the p-median problem and the capacitated vehicle routing problem. The results from both methods are compared in numerical experiments. The results show the effectiveness of 2EVRP-LF compared to the two-phase optimization. Furthermore, the simulated annealing algorithm showed an effective performance in solving 2EVRP-LF. © 2020 by the authors.

The mismanagement of waste is worse in the rural area where the number of available public trashcan is limited and the people have no idea where their trash actually ends up. In this research, a case study of waste management in Kampung Cipare-Tenjo, a small village 80 kilometers away from Jakarta, is conducted. The biggest purpose of the research is to educate people about sanitation and waste management, initiated by computing the most optimum number and locations of the public trashcans. The problem is addressed as Maximum Covering Location Problem (MCLP) to determine a set of facility locations that maximizes the total demand population served by the facilities within a prespecified maximum service distance. Two greedy heuristics algorithms: Greedy Adding Algorithm (GAA) and Greedy Adding with Substitution Algorithm (GAAS) are utilized to solve the problem. A sensitivity analysis is also done to check the result on the effect of trashcan number and maximum service distance to demand coverage. Out of the 26 location candidates, it is concluded that the final 10 locations are the most optimum in terms of demand coverage and service distance. The result of the research has been implemented in Kampung Cipare-Tenjo. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Greedy Heuristics; Maximum Covering Location Problem; trashcan location optimization; waste management",,,,,,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the support that given by Universitas Pertamina that funded the research under UPREACH 2019 collaboration grant.

In contrast to CVRP, a vehicle route in PCP involves a set of vertex-disjoint paths where a vehicle starts at a customer and finishes at another customer without traveling to the depot. PCP is defined to find a set of service paths to serve a set of customers that aiming to minimize the total traveling cost and hiring cost. This paper develops a hybrid approach that integrates variable neighborhood search (VNS) and tabu search (TS) to solve the problem. This algorithm presents an approach to explore the solution space by utilizing multi-set neighborhood and applying the systematic changing neighborhood of VNS. TS is incorporated into the algorithm to guide the search toward diverse regions. The computational results indicate that the proposed algorithm efficiently solves PCP. © 2019","Hybrid variable neighborhood search and tabu search; Tabu search; Variable neighborhood search; Vehicle routing problem; Vertex-disjoint path cover problem","Sales; Tabu search; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Capacitated vehicle routing problem; Computational results; Hybrid Meta-heuristic; Hybrid variables; Set of customers; Variable neighborhood search; Vehicle Routing Problems; Vertex disjoint paths; Computational efficiency",,,,"106-2410-H-011-002-MY3

SOS is a powerful optimization technique that mimics the simulation of the typical symbiotic interactions among organisms in an ecosystem. This study presents a new SOSbased hybrid algorithm for solving the challenging construction site layout planning (CSLP) discrete problems. A new algorithm called the hybrid symbiotic organisms search with local operators (HSOS-LO) represents a combination of the canonical SOS and several local search mechanisms aimed at increasing the searching capability in discrete-based solution space. In this study, three CSLP problems that consist of single and multi-floor facility layout problems are tested, and the obtained results were compared with other widely used metaheuristic algorithms. The results indicate the robust performance of the HSOS-LO algorithm in handling discrete-based CSLP problems. © 2020 by the authors.","Algorithms; Construction; Metaheuristic; Optimization; Site layout planning; Symbiotic organisms search","Biology; Project management; Systems engineering; Complex optimization problems; Construction management; Construction site layouts; Facility layout problems; Hybrid metaheuristic algorithms; Meta heuristic algorithm; Optimization techniques; Symbiotic interaction; Optimization",,,,"SP DIPA-042.06.1.401516/2018

In Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, dockless bike-sharing was first introduced in Monas area in July 2018. Although dockless bike-sharing has many benefits, it also brings some challenges. User's freedom to put the bike anywhere after use is one of the benefits but also one of the challenges because of the scattered bikes. Since there is only a small number of researches that focuses on dockless bike-sharing system and its association with the parking capacity, we decided to start this research. This research is focused on modifying mathematical model of maximum covering problem to overcome the challenges by determining the total optimal parking locations and the bike capacity of each parking facility. The research used software AMPL to solve the problem and to determine the optimal parking location. The result of the research is that the optimal parking locations to cover 95% of Monas area is at least 30 facilities with the capacity of each facility is at least 40. © 2020 ACM.","AMPL; Dockless bike-sharing; Jakarta; Maximum covering problem; Monas","Location; Carbon pollution; Indonesia; Jakarta; Maximum coverage; Maximum covering problems; Parking facilities; Parking locations; Sharing systems; Bicycles",,,,,,,"Demaio, P., Bike-sharing: History, impacts, models of provision, and future (2009) Journal of Public Transportation, 12 (4), pp. 41-56. , http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/2375-0901.12.4.3, 2009; Mateo-Babiano, I., Public bicycle sharing in asian cities (2015) J.

Many studies about online learning were done in developed countries and only a few in developing countries. Moreover, these studies used a qualitative approach which limits the results to be applied in different settings. While traditional research using a survey to understand people's perceptions towards an entity requires a lot of time and effort, we used efficient and effective manners to gather opinions and then analyzed its sentiments using the Logstash, Kibana, and Python programming language (ELK stack) and Naive Bayes algorithm. We used the Naive Bayes algorithm for sentiment analysis and ELK stack for storing & gathering tweets from Twitter. With ELK stack, we successfully collected 133.477 tweets related to online learning. From this study, we understood what kind of words that are sentimentally positive and negative tweets. We also gained some insights regarding Indonesia's student online learning application preferences. © Kassel University Press GmbH.","Developing country; ELK stack; Online learning; Sentiment analysis; Twitter","Classifiers; Computer aided instruction; Developing countries; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Developed countries; Indonesia; Naive-Bayes algorithm; Online learning; Public perception; Python programming language; Qualitative approach; E-learning",,,,,"For future researchers whom are interested in the data this research used, we make available the present research dataset in the following link: http://bit.ly/publPercDataset.

Learner's Generated Content (LGC) is one of the emerging learning media that showed interesting promises. LGC is based on the concept of User Generated Content; many advantages of UGC also existed in LGC: speed, collaboration, and the diversity of contents. Although past researches have already proven that LGC has positive effects on the educational process, mainly, these previous researches focused only on the perspective of the educators. This study questioned how today's students, mostly comprised of Generation Z, see LGC. Employing the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), we revealed several statistical results followed by managerial interpretations. Attitude (AT) was shown to have the highest correlation with Generation Z's students (β=0.43), educators could utilise this fact; they can be more reassured when implementing LGC in their future curriculum. The Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC) was also significant towards our respondent's behavioural intention (β=0.34), indicating that there is a little limitation for students to use LGC as part of their learning activity. © 2020 Kassel University Press GmbH.","Generation Z; Learning media; LGC; SEM; TPB","Curricula; Scanning electron microscopy; Behavioural intentions; Educational materials; Generation Z; Learning media; Perceived behavioral control; Theory of Planned Behavior; Theory of planned behaviour; User-generated content; Students",,,,,,,"Peterson, R.A., Balasubramanian, S., Bronnenberg, B.J., Exploring the implications of the Internet for consumer marketing (1997) Journal of the Academy of Marketing science, 25 (4), p. 329. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0092070397254005; Murugesan, S., Understanding Web 2.0 (2007) IT Professional Magazine, 9 (4), p. 34; Ye, Q., Law, R., Gu, B., Chen, W., The influence of user-generated content on traveler behavior: An empirical investigation on the effects of e-word-of-mouth to hotel online bookings (2011) Computers in Human behavior, 27 (2), pp. 634-639. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2010.04.014; Hermida, A., Thurman, N., A clash of cultures: The integration of user-generated content within professional journalistic frameworks at British newspaper websites (2008) Journalism practice, 2 (3), pp. 343-356. , https://doi.org/10.1080/17512780802054538; O'Connor, P., User-generated content and travel: A case study on Tripadvisor. com (2008) Information and communication technologies in tourism 2008, pp. 47-58. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-211-77280-5_5; Daugherty, T., Eastin, M.S., Bright, L., Exploring consumer motivations for creating user-generated content (2008) Journal of interactive advertising, 8 (2), pp. 16-25. , https://doi.org/10.1080/15252019.2008.10722139; Shao, G., Understanding the appeal of user-generated media: A uses and gratification perspective (2009) Internet research, 19 (1), pp. 7-25. , https://doi.org/10.1108/10662240910927795; Cheong, H.J., Morrison, M.A., Consumers' reliance on product information and recommendations found in UGC (2008) Journal of Interactive Advertising, 8 (2), pp. 38-49. , https://doi.org/10.1080/15252019.2008.10722141; Cilliers, E.J., The challenge of teaching generation Z (2017) PEOPLE: International Journal of Social Sciences, 3 (1); Constantinides, E., Fountain, S.J., Web 2.0: Conceptual foundations and marketing issues (2008) Journal of direct, data and digital marketing practice, 9 (3), pp. 231-244. , https://doi.org/10.1057/palgrave.dddmp.4350098; Desai, S.P., Lele, V., Correlating internet, social networks and workplace-a case of generation Z students (2017) Journal of Commerce and Management Thought, 8 (4), p. 802. , https://doi.org/10.5958/0976-478x.2017.00050.7; Miller, R., Lammas, N., Social media and its implications for viral marketing (2010) Asia Pacific Public Relations Journal, 11 (1), pp. 1-9; Riegner, C., Word of mouth on the web: The impact of Web 2.0 on consumer purchase decisions (2007) Journal of advertising research, 47 (4), pp. 436-447. , https://doi.org/10.2501/s0021849907070456; Brand-Gruwel, S., Wopereis, I., Walraven, A., A descriptive model of information problem solving while using internet (2009) Computers & Education, 53 (4), pp. 1207-1217. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2009.06.004; Wheeler, S., Yeomans, P., Wheeler, D., The good, the bad and the wiki: Evaluating student-generated content for collaborative learning (2008) British journal of educational technology, 39 (6), pp. 987-995. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00799.x; Chou, P.-N., Chen, H.-H., Engagement in online collaborative learning: A case study using a web 2.0 tool (2008) Journal of Online Learning and Teaching, 4 (4), pp. 574-582; Mustapha, S.S., Building Learning System for Content Knowledge and Social Knowledge (2018) International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET), 13 (1), pp. 4-22. , https://doi.org/10.3991/ijet.v13i01.6912; McLoughlin, C., Lee, M., (2007) Social software and participatory learning: Pedagogical choices with technology affordances in the Web 2.0 era; McLoughlin, C., Lee, M.J., Future learning landscapes: Transforming pedagogy through social software (2008) Innovate: Journal of Online Education, 4 (5); Mathieson, K., Predicting user intentions: Comparing the technology acceptance model with the theory of planned behavior (1991) Information systems research, 2 (3), pp. 173-191. , https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2.3.173; Jones, V., Jo, J., Martin, P., Future Schools and How Technology can be used to support Millennial and Generation-Z Students (2007) ICUT 2007 (Proc.

In the context of the TOPTW-PS, each node is associated with a set of scores with respect to a set of attributes. The objective of TOPTW-PS is to find a set of routes that maximizes the total score collected from a subset of attributes when visiting the nodes subject to the time budget and the time window at each visited node. We develop a mathematical model and propose a discrete version of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), namely, the Selective-Discrete PSO (S-DPSO), to solve TOPTW-PS. The proposed S-DPSO uses four different movement schemes to move a particle from its current position. The best movement scheme is selected to determine the next position of the particle. To evaluate the performance of the proposed S-DPSO algorithm, we first test S-DPSO on two variants of Orienteering Problem, namely, Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) and TOPTW. Experimental results show that S-DPSO performs well in solving benchmark instances of TOP and TOPTW. In general, S-DPSO is comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms for these problems.

While traditional hub location problems have been employed for developing network designs for many specific applications, their general assumptions – such as full connectivity, uniform transfer mode, and direct connections between access nodes and hubs – restrict their direct applicability to real-world logistics problems in several ways. In many network design contexts, the usage of versatile transfer modes and hubs is required due to different pricing of modes and topological considerations. In this paper, we extend the traditional hub location problem by incorporating three transfer modes and two kinds of hubs. As an important additional modification, we do not assume that the underlying network is fully connected, or that hubs and access nodes are directly connected. The context for our modelling is intermodal container movements in an archipelago. We develop and formulate an intermodal hub location problem. We show that this problem is NP-hard. Furthermore, a dataset for intermodal hub location problem is provided, based on a real-world container distribution problem in Indonesia. This dataset involves three modes of transport and a sparse network structure. We perform computational experiments and analyse our computational results. Our model provides insights for decision making and determining pricing policies for the desired levels of network flow. © 2018","Container logistics; Hub location; Intermodal network design; Network design","Containers; Costs; Decision making; Site selection; Computational experiment; Computational results; Container logistics; Distribution problem; Hub location; Hub location problems; Intermodal containers; Network design; Location",,,,,,,"Akgün, I., Tansel, B., p-hub median problem for non-complete networks (2018) Comput.

TOPTW-TDS builds a set of paths to maximize the collected scores. The score of visiting an attraction is different depending on the time of visit. A mathematical formulation is proposed for this new problem. Since the problem is NP-hard, a hybrid artificial bee colony (HABC) algorithm is proposed to find the optimal solutions for small instances and near-optimal solutions for larger instances. Three datasets (small, medium and large) are generated with 168 TOPTW-TDS instances. Computational results reveal that the proposed HABC algorithm can generate high-quality TOPTW-TDS solutions. The proposed HABC obtains the optimal solution of each small TOPTW-TDS instance. For medium and large TOPTW-TDS instances, HABC results are comparable with the SA results. Additionally, results from solving TOPTW benchmark instances indicate that the proposed HABC compares well with the state-of-the-art algorithms for TOPTW. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial bee colony; Logistics; Metaheuristics; Team orienteering problem; Time window; Time-dependent score","Benchmarking; Logistics; Optimal systems; Artificial bee colonies; Meta heuristics; Team orienteering problems; Time dependent; Time windows; Optimization",,,,"Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, CGMH: CMRPD3G0011, 105-2410-H-182-009-MY2/107-2410-H-182-005-MY2

The concern of software piracy is not limited to software developers but also educational institutions. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the factors contributing to the behavioral intention of Generation Z students' to comply with educational software anti-piracy laws by utilizing the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). The results indicated that self-efficacy and response efficacy had significant relationships with the behavioral intention of Generation Z's intention to comply with educational software anti-piracy laws. Several insights from practical and managerial perspective were also discussed. In the end, software developer and academic institutions could use this model to promote anti-piracy behavior in the future. © 2019 Kassel University Press GmbH.","Behavioral intention; Educational software;

Similarly to SARP. taxi in G-SARP can service passenger and package requests at the same time. However, G-SARP allows the taxi to transport more than one passenger at the same time, which is more beneficial in practical situations. In addition, G-SARP has no restrictions on the maximum riding time o. passenger, and the number of parcel requests that can be inserted between the pick-up and drop-off points o. passenger is limited only by vehicle capacity. simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is proposed to solve G-SARP. The proposed SA algorithm is compared with basic SA and tabu search (TS) algorithms. The results show that the proposed SA algorithm outperforms basic SA and TS algorithms. Moreover, further analysis shows that G-SARP solutions are better than those of SARP in most cases. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","General share-a-ride problem; ride sharing; share-a-ride problem; simulated annealing","Tabu search; Taxicabs; General share-a-ride problem; Ride-sharing; SA algorithm; share-a-ride problem; Simulated annealing algorithms; Tabu search algorithms; TS-algorithms; Vehicle capacity; Simulated annealing",,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST

The problem is motivated by the development of a tourist trip design application when there are several transportation modes available for tourists to choose during their trip. We develop a mixed integer programming model for MM-TOPTW based on the standard TOPTW model with additional considerations of transportation mode choices, including transportation cost and transportation time. Because MM-TOPTW is NP-hard, we design a two-level particle swarm optimization with multiple social learning terms (2L-GLNPSO) to solve the problem. To demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm, we employ the proposed 2L-GLNPSO to solve 56 MM-TOPTW instances that are generated based on VRPTW benchmark instances. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed 2L-GLNPSO can obtain optimal solutions to small and medium-scale instances. For large-scale instances, 2L-GLNPSO is capable of producing high-quality solutions. Moreover, we test the proposed algorithm on standard TOPTW benchmark instances and obtains competitive results with the state-of-art algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Multiple transportation modes; Particle swarm optimization; Team orienteering problem; Time window; Tourist trip design problem","Benchmarking; Integer programming; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Transportation; Computational results; Design problems; High-quality solutions; Mixed integer programming model; Model and algorithms; Team orienteering problems; Time windows; Transportation mode; Problem solving",,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST: 103-2221-E-011-062-MY3, Most 105-2811-E-011-017

We focus on vehicles that use a hybrid power source, known as the Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) and generate a mathematical model to minimize the total cost of travel by driving PHEV. Moreover, the model considers the utilization of electric and fuel power depending on the availability of either electric charging or fuel stations. We develop simulated annealing with a restart strategy (SA_RS) to solve this problem, and it consists of two versions. The first version determines the acceptance probability of a worse solution using the Boltzmann function, denoted as SA_RSBF. The second version employs the Cauchy function to determine the acceptance probability of a worse solution, denoted as SA_RSCF. The proposed SA algorithm is first verified with benchmark data of the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), with the result showing that it performs well and confirms its efficiency in solving CVRP. Further analysis show that SA_RSCF is preferable compared to SA_RSBF and that SA with a restart strategy performs better than without a restart strategy. We next utilize the SA_RSCF method to solve HVRP. The numerical experiment presents that vehicle type and the number of electric charging stations have an impact on the total travel cost. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cauchy function; Hybrid electric vehicle; Hybrid vehicle routing problem; Restart strategy; Simulated annealing","Crashworthiness; Hybrid vehicles; Problem solving; Simulated annealing; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Boltzmann function; Capacitated vehicle routing problem; Electric charging; Hybrid power sources; Numerical experiments; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Restart strategy; Vehicle Routing Problems; Plug-in hybrid vehicles",,,,,,,"Beamon, B.M., Supply chain design and analysis: models and methods (1998) Int.

The objective of CVRP is to decide the routes for a set of vehicles to serve a set of demand points while minimizing the total routing cost. SOS is a simple and powerful metaheuristic that simulates the symbiotic interaction strategies adopted by an organism for surviving in an ecosystem. As SOS is originally developed for solving continuous optimization problems, we therefore apply two solution representations, SR-1 and SR-2, to transform SOS into an applicable solution approach for CVRP and then apply a local search strategy to improve the solution quality of SOS. The original SOS uses three interaction strategies, mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism, to improve a candidate solution. In this improved version, we propose two new interaction strategies, namely competition and amensalism. We develop six versions of SOS for solving CVRP. The first version, SOSCanonical, utilizes a commonly used continuous to discrete solution representation transformation procedure. The second version is an improvement of canonical SOS with a local search strategy, denoted as SOSBasic. The third and fourth versions use SR-1 and SR-2 with a local search strategy, denoted as SOSSR-1 and SOSSR-2. The fifth and sixth versions, denoted as ISOSSR-1 and ISOSSR-2, improve the implementation of SOSSR-1 and SOSSR-2 by adding the newly proposed competition and amensalism interaction strategies. The performances of SOSCanonical, SOSBasic, SOSSR-1, and SOSSR-2 are evaluated on two sets of benchmark problems. First, the results of the four versions of SOS are compared, showing that the preferable result was obtained from SOSSR-1 and SOSSR-2. The performances of SOSSR-1, SOSSR-2, ISOSSR-1, and ISOSSR-2 are then compared, presenting that ISOSSR-1 and ISOSSR-2 offer a better performance. Next, the ISOSSR-1 and ISOSSR-2 results are compared to the best-known solutions. The results show that ISOSSR-1 and ISOSSR-2 produce good VRP solutions under a reasonable computational time, indicating that each of them is a good alternative algorithm for solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Capacitated vehicle routing problem; Metaheuristics; Solution representation; Symbiotic organisms search","Biology; Ecology; Local search (optimization); Systems engineering; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Alternative algorithms; Capacitated vehicle routing problem; Continuous optimization problems; Discrete optimization problems; Meta heuristics; Solution representation; Symbiotic interaction; Symbiotic organisms search; Problem solving",,,,,,,"Dantzig, G.B., Ramser, J.H., The truck dispatching problem (1959) Manage.

This appreciation, coupled with the advances of numerous applications in the vehicle routing problem (VRP) across numerous practical contexts, presents an opportunity to explore the open VRP with cross-docking (OVRPCD). We introduce a general example in retail wherein the capital expenditure necessary in vehicle acquisition can become a burden for the retailer, who then needs to consider outsourcing a logistics service as a cost-effective option. This practical scenario can be applied to create an open flow network of routes. This study considers a single product and single cross-dock wherein capacitated homogeneous vehicles start at different pickup points and times during pickup operations. The vehicles are scheduled to route in the network synchronously to arrive at the cross-dock center simultaneously. In the delivery operations, all customers must be served at most once and deliveries should be finished within a predetermined duration. We model OVRPCD as a mixed-integer linear program that minimizes the total cost (vehicle hiring cost and transportation cost). A simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. SA is first verified by solving benchmark instances for the vehicle routing problem with cross-docking and comparing the results with those obtained by existing state-of-art algorithms. We then test SA on three sets of OVRPCD benchmark instances and the results are compared with those obtained by CPLEX. Computational results show that both CPLEX and SA can obtain optimal solutions to all small and medium instances. However, the computational time required by SA is shorter than that needed by CPLEX. Moreover, for large instances, SA outperforms CPLEX in both solution value and computational time. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Cross-docking; Open vehicle routing problem; Simulated annealing","Benchmarking; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Docks; Hydraulic structures; Integer programming; Network routing; Pickups; Routing algorithms; Sales; Simulated annealing; Vehicles; Capital expenditures; Computational results; Crossdocking; Mixed integer linear program; Open vehicle routing problems; Simulated annealing algorithms; Vehicle routing problem; Vehicle Routing Problems; Problem solving",,,,"Ministry of Education, MOE

An improved variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. The improved VNS features a route construction mechanism to ensure the customers with earlier time windows will be served first.

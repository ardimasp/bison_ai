Structural Equation Model used as statistical test with SmartPLS 3.0 software. The sampling technique is quota sampling. Data source in this research is primary data with 1000 respondents who have accessed fintech Peer to Peer lending also using services provided recently. The results of statistical analysis using PLS-SEM demonstrated that perceived benefit, trust, usefulness and ease of use had significant impect to the intention to choosing fintech lending services. © 2019 IEEE.","credit; fintech; lending; loan; peer to peer lending; technology acceptance model","Behavioral research; Information management; Software testing; credit; fintech; lending; loan; Peer-to-peer lending; Technology acceptance model; Finance",,,,,"Chishti, S., Barberis, J., (2016) The FinTech Book; Leong, C., Tan, B., Xiao, X., Tan, F.T.C., Sun, F.Y., Nurturing a fintech ecosystem (2017) International Journal of Information Management, 37 (2), pp. 92-97; (2016) Global Fintech Investment Growth Continues in 2016 Driven by Europe and Asia, , Accenture April; (2018) Fintech Indonesia Report 2018-The State of Play for Fintech Indonesia, , Fintechnews June; Amalia, F., The fintech Book: The financial technology handbook for investors, entrepreneurs, and visionaries (2016) Journal of Indonesian Economy and Business, 31 (3), pp. 345-348; Davis, K., Maddock, R., Foo, M., (2017) Catching-Up with Indonesia ' S Fintech Industry; Davis, F.D., (1986) A Technology Acceptance Model for Empirically Testing New Enduser Information Systems: Theory and Results, , Doctoral Dissertation, Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MA; Mathieson, K., Predicting user intentions: Comparing the technology acceptance model with the theory of planned behavior (1991) Information Systems Research, 2 (3), pp. 173-191; Mishra, R., Sharma, R., A review of evolution of theories and models of technology adoption (2014) IMJ, 6 (2), pp. 17-29; Moon, J., Kim, Y., Extending the TAM for a world wide web context (2001) Journal of Information and Management Science, 27 (1), pp. 15-22; Schierz, P.G., Schilke, O., Wirtz, B.W., Understanding consumer acceptance of mobile payment services (2010) Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 9 (3), pp. 209-216; Venkatesh, V., Davis, F.D., A theoretical extension of the technology acceptance model: Four longitudinal field studies (2000) Management Science, 46 (2), pp. 186-204; Safeena, R., Date, F., Kammani, A., Internet banking adoption in an emerging economy: Indian consumer's perspective (2011) International Arab Journal of E-Technology, 2 (1), pp. 56-64; Schierz, P.G., Schilke, O., Wirtz, B.W., Understanding consumer acceptance of mobile payment services: An empirical analysis Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 9 (3). , 2020; Macintosh, G., Lockshin, L.S., Retail relationships and store loyalty: A multi-level perspective (1997) International Journal of Research in Marketing, 14 (1), pp. 487-497; Nor, K.M., Shanab, E.A.A., Internet banking acceptance in Malaysia based on the theory of reasoned action (2008) Journal of Information Systems and Technology Management, 5 (1), pp. 03-14; Heijden Der Van, H., Understanding online purchase intentions: Contributions from technology and trust perspectives (2003) European Journal of Information Systems, 12 (1), pp. 41-48; Huang, C.L., Simultaneous-equation model for estimating consumer risk perceptions, attitudes, and willingness-to-pay for residue-free produce (1993) The Journal of Consumer Affairs, 27 (2), pp. 377-396; Ajzen, I., From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior (1985) Action Control SSSP Springer Series in Social Psychology, , In: Kuhl J., Beckmann J.

In this research, theoretical studies conducted on adaptive and personalized e-learning. Additional material obtained either from books or related journals as a reference in the system development. The model developed in this study were made independently in order to design more flexible ontology. Five models developed in this study, (1) prior knowledge, (2) user models, (3) the domain model, (4) content models, (5) learning path. The final output of this study is a recommendation that our proposed model can be applied as a foundation for the next stage, which is prototype development. © 2016 IEEE.","adaptive; e-learning; learning system; personalized","Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Ontology; adaptive; Design ontologies; personalized; Personalized e-learning; Personalized learning systems; Prototype development; System development; User requirements; E-learning",,,,,"Alexander, O., (2009) Designing Ontology User-Model for the Development of Personalized E-Learning System Based on Semantic Web, , Fasilkom UI; Chen, C.-M., Intelligent web-based learning system with personalized learning path guidance (2008) Computers & Education, 51 (2), pp. 787-814; (2011), http://gtoms.com/elearning.php, E-Learning. accessed on 19 November 2015; http://www.internetworldstats.com/top20.htm, Internet World Stat.

Not all the mistyped words are totally wrong. If they are caused by human errors, we should look further to handle it. Thus, enhanced version of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is proposed. LSA is enhanced by calculating the value of mistyped words before constructing the term document matrix. Essays which are scored consists of 119 English essays of student's writing assignment while several essays as gold standard are made by experts. All of the essays have been scored manually by the human grader. Enhanced LSA gives the closeness level of 0.242 to human judgment, while LSA indicates the closeness level of 0.244 to human judgment. Unfortunately, Enhanced LSA cannot outperform GLSA which is one of current methods. The experiment result indicates that Enhanced LSA by considering mistyped words has a better closeness value to human judgment compared with LSA. © 2016 IEEE.","enhanced LSA; Latent Semantic Analysis; mistyped words; term document matrix","Matrix algebra; Automated essay scoring; Document matrices; enhanced LSA; Gold standards; Human judgments; Latent Semantic Analysis; mistyped words; Writing assignments; Semantics",,,,,"Hyland, K., (2004) Disciplinary Discourses: Social Interactions in Academic Writing, , Michigan: The University of Michigan Press; Wild, F., Stahl, C., Stermsek, G., Neumann, G., Parameters Driving Effectiveness of Automated Essay Scoring with LSA (2005) Proceedings of the 9th CAA Conference Loughborough; Dikli, S., Automated Essay Scoring (2006) Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education, 7 (5), pp. 49-62; Dikli, S., An Overview of Automated Scoring of Essays (2006) Journal of Technology, Learning, and Assessment, 5 (1); Landauer, T.K., Foltz, P.W., Laham, D., Introduction to Latent Semantic Analysis (1998) Discourse Processes, 25, pp. 259-284; Islam, M.M., Hoque, S.M.L., Automated Essay Scoring Using Generalized Latent Semantic Analysis (2012) Journal of Computers, 7 (3); Hofmann, T., Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (1999) Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, UAI""99, Stockholm; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 993-1022; Valenti, S., Neri, F., Cucchiarelli, A., An Overview of Current Research on Automated Essay Grading (2003) Journal of Information Technology Education, 2",,,"APTIKOM","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1st International Conference on Informatics and Computing, ICIC 2016","28 October 2016 through 29 October 2016",,127421,,9781509016488,,,"English","Int.

The quantitative results showed that the conversation patterns between the staff and foreign guests; in this case international students and teachers, could happen in two big domains of “face-to-face” and phone interactions. The qualitative results showed that the English proficiency of these staff was mostly at beginner’s level, and thus the pocket book should be designed with simple sentence structure, common vocabulary, and easy pronunciation way.

Although there were many evidences indicating a strong link between effective leadership and successful TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other languages) program, there was still a lack of studies of leadership into the field. This article investigated leadership practices which supported TESOL program for undergraduate EFL students at BINUS University, where English courses were compulsory and EFL students were the majority. Effective leadership practices for TESOL were highlighted, which were setting goals and objectives, allowing leaders to be pioneers, providing TESOL professional training, and facilitating TESOL program. Obstacles to these practices were also found, such as the lack of shared information network and the prevailing minor views on TESOL program, in which members were considered having the low status. The article concluded that as EFL students were growing in number in the university to meet their future targets at international contexts, the need and focus on developing leadership practices and resources to support TESOL program was inevitable. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

The research project applied the descriptive approach of quantitative method, and thus depended on numerical data. The research project examined the data under two paired scores of the same class groups. The set of scores was to compare the reading scores with the writing results. Then, the degree of correlation of the pair was tested so as to find its significance. Interpretation and explanation of data was made based on the statistical results by using correlation research analysis.

To incorporate the syntactic information, Syntactically Enhanced LSA (SELSA) is used, whilst Stanford CoreNLP Natural Language Processing Toolkit is used for the Coreference Resolution. To evaluate the results, we calculate the average absolute difference between the system score and human score for each essay. Based on the results, we can conclude that syntactic information, when combined with Coreference Resolution, do not have higher correlation to human score than LSA (an average absolute difference of 0.15748 as opposed to LSA's 0.12597). But interestingly, the two techniques work better when they are used together, rather than when they are used separately. We also develop a new algorithm to calculate the scores, with a better average absolute difference, which is as high as 0.08969.","Automated essay scoring; Coreference resolution; Syntactically enhanced latent semantic analysis; Word order","Automation; Semantics; Syntactics; Absolute difference; Automated essay scoring; Co-reference resolutions; Latent Semantic Analysis; NAtural language processing; Stanford; Syntactic information; Word orders; Natural language processing systems",,,,,"Landauer, T.K., Foltz, P.W., Laham, D., Introduction to latent semantic analysis (1998) Discourse Processes, 25, pp. 259-284; Kanejiya, D., Kumar, A., Prasad, S., Automatic evaluation of students' answers using syntactically enhanced LSA (2003) Proceedings of the HLT-NAACL 03 Workshop on Building Educational Applications Using Natural Language Processing, 2, pp. 53-60; Miller, T., Essay assessment with latent semantic analysis (2003) Journal of Educational Computing Research, 29 (4), pp. 495-512; Foltz, P.W., Laham, D., Landauer, T.K., Automated essay scoring: Applications to educational technology (1999) Proc. of the ED-MEDIA'99 Conference, , Charlottesville.

In this study, the data used are time series of the number of passengers for eleven years. These data will form patterns which indicate the number of passengers each month in a year as the input data and the number of passengers next year as a target prediction. After the input data are clustered into three types using fuzzy C-means (FCM), the data are processed using adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to get the prediction data. The result shows that the “Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPE ) which represent the errors for 4 years are 4.20%, 5.70%, 5.36% and 4.47% with an average of 4.93% . Based on this result, FCM and ANFIS can be combined to predict the data time series. © 2017 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","ANFIS; FCM; Number of passenger; Prediction",,,,,,"Litman, T., Burwell, D., Issues in sustainable transportation (2006) Int.

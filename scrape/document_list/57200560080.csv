The Indonesian government has introduced a universal coverage system that adopts Diagnosis Related Group (DRG), namely Indonesia Case Base Group (INA- CBG). INA-CBG is used to improve the service of healthcare providers and integrate user data into one database. Hence, there is a possibility of security gaps in protecting data from unauthorized users. Therefore, an analysis was performed based on the regulation published in Indonesia and the current INA-CBG system. A security lattice model of access control was produced to set constraints to prevent data privacy from being retrieved by unauthorized users. There are five security level categorizations as follows: Public, Research, Clinical, Financial, and Provider. Each security level was assigned to 26 attributes which are components of the current INA-CBG system. Furthermore, a simulation has been performed based on the model developed to ensure that the assigned level is correct. The results of the simulation will be used as a reference in determining the security lattice of each attribute if the result shows there are inappropriate levels. © 2020 ICIC International.","DRG; INA-CBG; Security lattice; Security level; Universal coverage system",,,,,,,"Teoh, T.-T., Nguwi, Y.-Y., Elovici, Y., Ng, W.-L., Thiang, S.-Y., Analyst intuition inspired neural network based cyber security anomaly detection (2018) International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 14 (1), pp. 379-386; Zhang, D., Big data security and privacy protection (2018) Proc. of the 8th International Conference on Management and Computer Science (ICMCS 2018); Jayabalan, M., O'daniel, T., Access control and privilege management in electronic health record: A systematic literature review (2016) Journal of Medical Systems, 40 (12); Green, M., Smith, M., Developers are not the enemy!: The need for usable security apis (2016) IEEE Security & Privacy, 14 (5), pp. 40-46; Archenaa, J., Anita, E.

Despite of its high performance, Deep Learning requires a gigantic amount of training data to show its best result. Getting this massive data in reasonable time requires a proper strategy such as crowdsourcing. However, in case of object counting, we found no crowdsourcing system able to effectively collect necessary data. To tackle this problem, we develop a crowdsourcing system to annotate image for object counting dataset. This system is also equipped with validation system to ensure the quality of collected dataset. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

This paper combines two algorithms, cuckoo search algorithm and k-means algorithm in clustering problem called FCSA. Cuckoo search is used to build the robust initialization, while K-means is used to accelerate by building the solutions. The result confirms that FCSA's computational time in ten datasets is faster than the compared algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.","Clustering; Cuckoo search algorithm (CSA); Fast algorithm; K-means algorithm","Learning algorithms; Optimization; Problem solving; Clustering; Clustering problems; Computational time; Cuckoo search algorithms; Fast algorithms; Fast convergence; k-Means algorithm; Optimization problems; Clustering algorithms",,,,,,"Girsang, A.S., Tsai, C.-W., Yang, C.-S., A fast bee colony optimization for traveling salesman problem (2012) Innovations in Bio-Inspired Computing and Applications (IBICA), 2012 Third International Conference On, pp. 7-12; Girsang, A.S., Tsai, C.-W., Yang, C.-S., Rectifying the inconsistent fuzzy preference matrix in AHP Using a multi-objective bicriterionant (2016) Neural Process.

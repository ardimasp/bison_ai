It used the quantitative method with 160 students as the research subjects with the data collection technique of questionnaire distribution. The questionnaires are valid (the corrected item total correlations for knowledge, attitudes and behavior are: 0.745, 0.878 and 0.726) and reliable (α for knowledge, attitudes and behavior are: 0.985, 0.978 and 0.959). The positive nuances questionnaire's results are analyzed through a correlative analysis. The results showed scale 4 were chosen most for knowledge and attitude (41.40% and 42.93%), only in behavior the scale 3 was the most chosen (34.63%). The results concluded that the students tend to have positive knowledge, attitude and behavior towards the sustainable development, and the results will give strong support the sustainable future for human security. The results were connected with the big data, especially in social media and instant messaging where they can learn and get educated about sustainable development. © 2020 ACM.","attitude; behavior; big data; instant messaging; Knowledge; social media; sustainable development","Planning; Students; Surveys; Sustainable development; Correlative analysis; Data collection; Higher education; Human securities; Instant messaging; Quantitative method; Research subjects; Social media; Big data",,,,"Binus University","The study is supported by BINUS University Grant.","Rosen, M.A., The future of sustainable development (2017) Welcome to the European Journal of Sustainable Development Research.

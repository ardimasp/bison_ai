For this time, deficiency surveillance is carried on manually which needs more effort especially for large area. With rapid growth of technology, it is possible to build a system via smartphone to detect the nutrient deficiency of plants. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional neural network to diagnose condition based on image of plants. Inception-Resnet architecture with transfer learning and fine tuning from model that is previously trained using ImageNet dataset is applied in the experi- ments. We trained the model further with image of okra plants. The dataset consists of 184 images for the training process and 47 images for testing. Image augmentation method is also used to increase the variation of the dataset. The experimental results show that fine tuning approach achieves the best accuracy, namely 96% and 86% for training and testing respectively.

Matrix code itself is a 2-dimensional barcode that appears to be a 2D image that consists of usually black and white dots that can be printed or displayed on a screen. CQR Code is an extended version of the popular QR Code. 3D barcodes contains data not only in its x and y axis, but also in depth. By stacking QR Codes we can create a new barcode system that can store more data than other existing barcode systems. Through this barcode system, we can embed data that normally could not be done using existing barcode systems. From the tests that had been conducted, currently the CQR Code is capable of storing data up to 9KB with 3 layers and 8 colors. The CQR Code can be read with 40% - 100% chance of success using a multi-format mobile phone barcode reader prototype. We have also implemented a simple color correction algorithm into the barcode reader to ensure its accuracy. In conclusion, CQR Code has the potential for future developments for it to be a simple, sophisticated, and easy to use barcode system that can store relatively large amounts of data.

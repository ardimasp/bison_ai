This paper presents the application of an open source spreadsheet solver in single depot routing problem. This study focuses on Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) Company as a case study. The objective of this research is to minimize the distance travel. This research begins by collecting data from a respective FMCG Company. A FMCG company based in Jakarta, Indonesia provides drinking water packaged in gallon. This FMCG Company have two distributions characteristic. Head office distribution was used in this case study due to highest internally rejected by company such as un-routed order, no visit, not enough time to visit and transportation issue. Based on computational results, overall solutions to delivered 214 gallons to 26 customers having total distance travelled 56.76 km, total driving time 2 hour and 49 minutes, total driver working time 7 hours and 57 minutes. Total savings of distances travelled between current route and the proposed solutions using open source spreadsheet solver is 7.25 km. As a result, an open source spreadsheet solver can be implemented in FMCG Company for single depot routing problem. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Driving time limit; Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG); Spreadsheet solver;

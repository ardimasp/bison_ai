Accounting information systems produce financial information. Financial information is also referred to as financial statements. The accounting information system collects data in the form of transactions that occur in companies such as purchase transactions, sales transactions, cash disbursements transactions and cash receipt transactions. Information in company financial reports is needed by both internal and external parties. The financial statements must meet the requirements, that is, have quality characteristics. To run an Accounting Information System (AIS), elements are needed so that the system can run properly and correctly. namely: (1) Human resources (HR) who have been trained; (2) Financial Data Form; (3) Hardware; (4) Software; (5) Procedure; (6) communication technology network; (7) database. The quality characteristics of financial statements consist of comprehensiveness, relevance, materiality, reliability, honest presentation, substance outperforming form, neutrality, sound judgment, and completeness. The accounting information system functions to oversee all the company's financial activities and collect and store data on the company's financial activities or transactions. © 2020 EManuscript Technologies.

To improve the competitiveness of cooperative, website that allows members/customers to search products and information related to cooperatives is made. Then, it analyzed using the method of making a website with 7 stages of internet marketing and the method of calculating the cost-benefit analysis to conduct an analysis of the investment value of the website creation. So far, Cooperative's marketing has been done conventionally. Cooperative has not been able to reach the online segment which has a larger market, so that Cooperatives can only serve customers who live close by. The result achieved from this design is a website that can be a place for cooperative in marketing their products. Website contains features that can help the cooper­ative to market their products and announce information like promos and other conveniences that can increase the profit earned by the cooperative.

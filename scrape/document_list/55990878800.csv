Nevertheless, there are still some fields that have the potential to develop with the help of smartphones but have not been maximized, one of which is the health sector. The increasing use of smartphones also makes WHO begin to pay attention to the use of mobile devices for the health sector or known as mHealth. However, based on a WHO survey, the use of mHealth in the South-East Asia Region is the lowest even though in that region there are India and Indonesia which are two of the top ten smartphone users worldwide. The purpose of this research is to develop and design an Android-based mobile application for inpatient management within the hospital which is also equipped with a website for administrators. The application aims to reduce manual recording of inpatient data so that data is more easily accessed when needed and becomes a means of communication between doctors and nurses. © 2020 ISSN 1881-803X.","Android; Application; Inpatient; Management",,,,,,"Sarwar, M., Soomro, T., Impact of smartphone's on society (2013) European Journal of Scientific Research, 98 (2), p. 218; (2018) Top Countries by Smartphone Users and Penetration, , https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-50-countries-by-smartphone-penetration-and-users; Van Der Wielen, B., (2018) Insights into the 2.3 Billion Android Smartphones in use around the World, , https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/insights-into-the-2-3-billion-android-smartphones-in-use-around-the-world; (2016) Global Diffusion of EHealth: Making Universal Health Coverage Achievable, , http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/252529/9789241511780-eng.pdf; Nugraha, D., Aknuranda, I., An overview of e-health in Indonesia: Past and present applications (2017) International Journal of Electrical and Computer, 7 (5), pp. 2449-2550; (2014) Regulation of the Minister of Health of the Republic of Indonesia No. 56 Year 2014, , http://yankes.kemkes.go.id/assets/downloads/PMK%20No.%2056%20ttg%20Klasifikasi%20dan%20Perizinan%20Rumah%20Sakit.pdf; Ernawati, E., (2012) Development of Hospital Information Systems (SIMR) to Improve Service Quality, , http://pkko.fik.ui.ac.id/files/Pengembangan%20Sistem%20Informasi%20Rumah%20Sakit%20-Rev.doc; Sanjaya, G., Rahmanti, A., Anggoro, P., Rachmadani, A., (2013) Hospital Information System: Where Direction of Use?, , https://publikasi.dinus.ac.id/index.php/fiki2013/article/download/527/304; Pereira, A., Marins, F., Rodrigues, B., Portela, F., Santos, M.F., Machado, J., Abelha, A., Improving quality of medical service with mobile health software (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 63, pp. 292-299; Lou, D., Chen, X., Zhao, Z., Xuan, Y., Xu, Z., Jin, H., Guo, X., Fang, Z., A wireless health monitoring system based on android operating system (2013) IERI Procedia, 4, pp. 208-215; Tuon, F., Gasparetto, J., Wollman, L., Moraes, T., Mobile health application to assist doctors in antibiotic prescription - An approach for antibiotic stewardship (2017) The Brazilian Journal of Infectious Disease, 21 (6), pp. 660-664",,,,"ICIC International",,,,,1881803X,,,,"English","ICIC Express Lett.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081959419

The project manager or project owner really needs a good calculation so that the use of resources can be done more efficiently. Use Case Points (UCP) is one method that can be used to measure the size of a software based on a use case diagram. Use case diagrams are usually made before the application begins to be developed into the application. In the calculation of UCP, there are 2 additional factors carried out: Technical Complexity Factor (TCF) and Environmental Factor (EF). This paper presents measurement software using use case points on the SIB mobile application. This application has never been measured both in terms of cost and size of the project. The results of the use case points method produce a UCP value of 129.86 and Effort Estimation (Effort) value of 1298.6 hours. With these results, the project manager gets a picture of the project so that the efficiency of the resources can be carried out properly. © 2019 ISSN.","Mobile application; Software cost; Software metric; Software size; Use case points",,,,,,"(2018) Number of Apps Available in Leading App Stores as of 3rd Quarter 2018, , https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores; Kashyap, D., Shukla, D., Misra, A.

Each data taken will be preprocessing, where the process was done by removing punctuation, hash tags and conversion of several emojis to text. By using the polyglotlibrary, determining an emotion from each term can be done more easily because the library can recognize various languages, including Indonesian. This experiment achieves55.41% accuracy.

Puzzles in the escape room traditionally have disadvantages because the type of puzzle that is made requires a lot of material. The purpose of this research is to produce a game with Escape Room as the basic theme with Virtual Reality technology. Virtual Reality technology is used to develop presence in users, attendance is about the intimacy of users with the gaming world. By using Virtual Reality, the puzzle elements that are created can be replaced regularly without the need to change the building's skeleton. The development method used is a prototype model using Unity game machines. The research method was carried out using a questionnaire for user analysis. The application generated from this research is the Escape Room VR game that can be played on an Android smartphone that is compatible with Samsung Gear VR.

This game also has a high re-playability, thanks to the generation process. Design/methodology/approach: Research methods include methods of data collection, design and implementation. Data collection was done through research literature, questionnaires and analyzing some similar applications. Designing game application using game design document and implementation was the done using the waterfall model and the unity game engine. Findings: Procedural dungeon generation is important when designing the game. If done correctly, it will reduce the designer’s time to design the map especially in dungeon, where in the dungeon, there are many floors and each floor must be designed differently based on the difficulty level of the game. The application uses the combined algorithm to create a variant dungeon, where each algorithm has its own advantages that the designer can use to design the variety of the dungeon. It also opens more algorithms to be used when creating the dungeon. Originality/value: This paper uses the combined algorithm for procedural dungeon generation, and the result shows that a player has high re-playability to the game. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Game developer; Game industry; Procedural content generation; Procedural dungeon generation; Re-playability; Role-playing game",,,,,,"Hendrikx, M., Meijer, S., Van Der Velden, J., Iosup, A., (2013) Procedural content generation for games: a survey, pp. 1-22. , in, ACM Transaction on Multimedia Computing Communication and Application; Linden, R.V.D., Lopes, R., Bidarra, R., (2014) Procedural generation of dungeons, pp. 1-12. , in, IEEE Transaction on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games; Mark, B., Berechet, T., Mahlmann, T., Togelius, J., (2015) Procedural Generation of 3D Caves for Games on the GPU, , in, Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games, Pacific Grove, CA; Shaker, N., Togelius, J., Nelson, M.J., (2016) Procedural Content Generation in Games: A Textbook and an Overview of Current Research, , Springer, Cham; Togelius, J., Champandard, A.J., Lanzi, P.L., Mateas, M., Paiva, A., Preuss, M., Stanley, K.O., (2013) Procedural content generation: goals, challenges and actionable steps, pp. 61-75. , in, Artificial and Computational Intelligence in Games, Schloss Dagstuhl – Leibniz-Zentrum fuer Informatik, Dagstuhl; Yannakakis, G.N., Togelius, J., (2015) Experience-driven procedural content generation (extended abstract), pp. 519-525. , in, International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction ACII, IEEE Computer Society, Xi’an; Adams, E., Fundamentals of game design (2010) Games and Videogames, p. 13. , in, p., 2nd ed., Pearson Education, Berkeley, CA",,,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,07419058,,,,"English","Libr.

Computer Aided Diagnosis (CADx) is system to determine type of cancer. This system divided into two phases, feature extraction and classification. So far, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is frequently used for feature extraction. Unfortunately, DWT has severe shift dependence and poor directional selectivity in 2-D and 3-D. This paper mainly focused on mammogram classification using Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT CWT) as feature extraction and Neural Network (NN) as classifier. Using this methodology produces accuracy 93.33% for cancer type classification. This accuracy is little higher than DWT.

DT-CWT can be used as extracted feature of image. DT-CWT can reduce the dimension of highly dimensional data such as large image. This paper use DT-CWT as feature extraction to obtain feature. This paper use Neural Network for recognition and using extracted feature as input and discuss about finding the effective number of node in Neural Network. Through this research, it can be concluded that one hidden layer give better accuracy compared to two hidden layers. A few number of nodes give same result of large number of nodes. The number of each hidden layer not influence the accuracy, but with few numbers of nodes has better time process. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Dtcwt; Face recognition; Neural network",,,,,,"Faundez-Zanuy, M., (2009) Biometric Security Technology, Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence, pp. 262-264; Kingsbury, N.G., The dual-tree complex wavelet transform: A new technique for shift invariance and directional filters (1998) IEEE Digital Signal Processing Workshop, DSP, 98 (86). , Bryce Canyon; Raja, K.B., Ramesha, K., Dual transform based feature extraction for face recognition (2011) IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, 8 (5). , No 2; Sun, Y., Du, M., Robust face recognition for illumination removal using DT-CWT and EMD (2008) 11th IEEE International Conference on Communication Systems 2008, pp. 357-361; Rajesh, R.S., Jaya Priya, K., Dual tree complex wavelet transform based face recognition with single view (2011) Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (CICN), pp. 601-605; Kingsbury, N.G., Complex wavelets for shift invariance analysis and filtering of signals (2001) Journal of Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis, 10 (3), pp. 234-253","Information Technology, Jl.

Currently, the source of electricity is mainly from gasoline. Therefore, the aims of this study include the investigation of the improvement of the life cycle cost (LCC), the net present value (NPV) and The Saving Investment Rate (SIR), as well as the payback period. In order to fulfill these objectives, software namely ""Building Life Cycle Cost"" or BLCC is applied. The results show that the SIR is more than 1, which means the use of solar panels is considerably beneficial for the aquaculture. The type of solar panels used in this study is a transparent panels made of amorphous solar cell with the efficiency of 0.079. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","economic analysis; LCC; NPV; payback period; SIR","Aquaculture; Costs; Investments; Life cycle; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Amorphous solar cells; Building life cycle; Economic feasibilities; Electricity source; Energy source; Life cycle costs (LCC); Payback periods; The net present value (NPV); Economic analysis",,,,,"(2018) Urban Themes, , https://unhabitat.org/urban-themes/, UN Habitat, retrieved: 5th July; Indriani, The calculation of electricity consumption for grouper fish aquaculture through salination, turbidity, Ph balance and water temperature (2018) Innovation, Technology and Application National Seminar; Fishery Team, W., (2015) Tiger Grouper Fish Aquaculture Using Floating Net Cage System, 2n Ed Series of Small Scale Fishery Guidance; Suharyati, Indonesia Energy Outlook 2019 (2019) National Energy Council; Roy, A., Kabir, A., Relative life cycle economic analysis of stand-alone solar PV and fossil fuel powered systems in Bangladesh with regard to load demand and market controlling factors (2012) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 16 (7), pp. 4629-4637; Hendarti, R., Wangidjaja, W., Septiafani, L.G., A study of solar energy for an aquaculture in Jakarta (2018) IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 195; Solargis, (2017) Solar Resources and Photovoltaic Potential of Indonesia; Hendarti, R., (2018) IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 109","Hendarti, R.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: rhendarti@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The study is aimed to investigate the required illuminance for the fish to grow. This aspect is necessary since the application of the solar panel will affect the illuminance below it. The results showed not all the PV panels type could facilitate the required illuminance. The steps of study is as follows: (1) to study the optimum light for the growth of the grouper fish, (2) to study the structure of the floating net cage, and (3) to study the optimal solar panel type that later will be integrated with the selected facility building © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

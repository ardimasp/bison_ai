This method refers to primary school students. Some of them felt Chinese language was difficult, especially Chinese characters. As a beginner, Chinese characters will seem strange during learn Chinese language. It can decreased children's motivation to learning. In modern age, the authors harness technology to learn Chinese language via mobile game. Chinese language learning through game becomes better solution to children than traditional learning. This paper propose to created game learning with method named mnemonic, the strategy to remember, which has many techniques can help learner to learn Chinese characters. This method would be better if applied in the form of educational games. © 2016 IEEE.","Chinese Language; Game-based Learning; Mnemonic; Mobile Learning","Information management; Chinese characters; Chinese language; Chinese language learning; Educational game; Game-based Learning; Mnemonic; Mobile Learning; Traditional learning; Education",,,,,"(2016) Ethnologue Languages of the World, , http//www.ethnologue.com/statistics/size, The Ethnologue Organization; Cheung, H., (2015) Pertumbuhan Pesat Ekonomi Cina Dalam Angka, , http//www.bbc.com/indonesia/majalah/2015/09/150910_majalah_ekonomi_cina, September; Santrock, J.W., (2007) Child Development, , McGraw-Hill; Tsan Pierre Lu, M., (2011) The Effect of Instructional Embodiment Designs on Chinese Language Learning: The Use of Embodied Animation for Beginning Learners of Chinese Characters; Azan Mat Zin, N., Jaafar, A., Seng Yue, W., Digital game-based learning (dgbl) model and development methodology for teaching history (2009) WSEAS Transactions on Computers, 8 (2); Shieh Jiann, C., The unified phonetic transcription for teaching and learning (2011) TOJET: The Turkish Online Jour Nal of Educational Technology, 10 (4); Greenwood, E., (2007) Get Talking Chinese, , New York: DK Publishing (Dorling Kindersley); (2016) YellowBridge, , http//www.yellowbridge.com/Chinese/pinyin-rules.php, YellowBridge; Yin See, S., Ho Ching, T., Mandarin as the chosen foreign language course among learners of foreign languages: A case study (2013) Researchers World Volume IV Issue, 3 (1), pp. 80-88; Sun, X., (2011) Motivations, Beliefs, and Chinese Language Learning: A Phenomenological Study in A Canadian University; Tsan, P., Lu, M., Hallman, G.L., Jr., Black, J.B., Chinese character learning: Using embodied animations in initial stages (2013) Journal of Technology and Chinese Language Teaching, pp. 1-24; Wong, L., Hsu, C., Sun, J., Boticki, I., How flexible grouping affects the collaborative patterns in a mobile-assisted Chinese character learning game (2013) Educational Technology & Society, 16 (2), pp. 174-187; Amiryousefi, M., Ketabi, S., Mnemonic instruction: A way to boost vocabulary learning and recall (2011) Journal of Language Teaching and Research, 2 (1), pp. 178-182; Shmidman, A., Ehri, L., Embedded picture mnemonics to learn letters (2010) Scientific Studies of Reading, 14 (2), pp. 159-182; Bakken, J.P., Simpson, C.G., Mnemonic strategies: Success for the young-adult learner (2011) The Journal of Human Resource and Adult Learning, 7 (2), pp. 79-85. , December; Yu, N., Mnemonic strategies in learning Chinese as a foreign language through computer-assisted learning process (2010) HRD Journal, 1 (2), pp. 25-31; Adams, E., (2014) Fundamentals of Game Design Third Edition, , Berkeley, California: New Riders; Gros, B., Digital games in education: The design of games-based learning environments (2007) Journal of Research on Technology in Education, pp. 23-38; Hoe Tan, W., Sue, J., Neil, S., Examining the potential of game based learning through the eyes of maths trainee teachers (2008) Proceedings of the British Society for Research into Learning Mathematics, 28 (3), pp. 120-124. , Joubert, M.

It caused by potential of China's economic growth in the world. Chinese language has introduced to children in early age in Indonesia. But sometimes learn Chinese language was difficult to them, which will make them feel boring. This paper has purpose to help children learn Chinese language using gamification and mnemonic method into game content. Briefly, gamification is process that adopt game elements to apply into non-game context and mnemonic is strategy to increase memory with various ways. Both in gamification and mnemonic method have applied in previous paper which the conclusion showed positive result in learning environment. This game refers to primary school, which students in 6-12 years old. The conclusion in this paper show that the developed game by authors can interest children to learn Chinese language based by pre-test and post-test result. © 2017 The Authors.

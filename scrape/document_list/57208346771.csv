However, to maintain credibility, trust from the public on service and learning capabilities as well as recognition extensively are needed. To measure capability in service and learning can be displayed by the technology used during all activities at the university. In this study, an analysis was conducted on the influence of ICT and Public Recognition on University Credibility by using Multiple Linear Regression test. The data used are questionnaire with 13 items representing three variables, namely Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Public Recognition, and University Credibility. Each instrument that is distributed and obtained was used to test the validity and reliability of the items. The results show that 61% of ICT and Public Recognition are proved to influence the credibility of the university. This shows that ICT and Public Regulations play a significant role in showing University Credibility where this can be used as a benchmark in improving good perceptions of university selection. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Credibility; ICT; Public; Recognition; Regression","Linear regression; Credibility; Information and Communication Technologies; Learning capabilities; Multiple linear regressions; Public; Recognition; Regression; Database systems",,,,,"Freeman, R.B., What does global expansion of higher education mean for the United States?

New horizons emerged with the implementation of the BI concept using “Cloud Computing”. The leading IT companies compete to develop BI cloud-based services (cloud BI). This study aimed to determine the factors influencing manager decision to adopt cloud BI in Indonesia’s financial service sector, using the diffusion of innovation (DOI) model and technology organization environment (TOE) framework. The research also obtains prediction of the cloud BI marketing trend in Indonesia. The survey conducted with 30 participants at the senior management level in Indonesia’s financial services sector. The findings reveal, the adoption rate of cloud BI in Indonesia financial service sector still very low. Only 3.4% of firms have implemented cloud BI, while 10% not considering the cloud BI adoption. The results of this research can be used by vendors to develop cloud BI tools that fit into the customer’s need. It is also very useful for marketers to know the characteristics and demographics of cloud BI users. For regulators, this research illustrates how and what drives regulators to make policies that can encourage companies to use the latest technology. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cloud BI; Cloud business intelligence; DOI framework; TOE framework","Commerce; Database systems; Information analysis; Marketing; Surveys; Business intelligent; Cloud business; Diffusion of innovations; DOI framework; Financial services sector; Senior management; Technology-organization-environment frameworks; TOE framework; Finance",,,,,"Olszak, C.M., Toward better understanding and use of business intelligence in organizations (2016) Inf.

Precisely, the Sustainable Supplier Selection is indispensable for company in both sustainable supply chain and sustainable company. This paper comprises a balance among the Conceptual, Theoretical and Managerial implications (CTM) and Empirical Study (ESY), that is known as Case Study (CSY). CTM in this paper constitutes the literature reviews. Those literature reviews are pertaining Supplier Selection (SPS), Supplier Evaluation (SPE), Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Analytic Network Process (ANP) of Saaty ((1980, 1990, 1995,1996, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005 and 2008), and eventually related methods not to mention the need from company for Multiple Criteria Decision Making. ESY in this paper constitutes the empirical study in PT. Alfa Global Indah (PT. AGI) using a software, namely, Super Decision, as elaborated by Saaty (2004). © Research India Publications.","Analytic Network Process (ANP); Business excellence; ICT as enabler; SuperDecision software; Supplier",,,,,,"Amindoust, A., Ahmed, S., Safghafinia, A., Bahreininejad, A., Sustainable supplier selection: A ranking model based on fuzzy inference system (2012) Applied Soft Computing, 12, pp. 1668-1677; De Boer, L., (1998) Operations research in support of purchasing.

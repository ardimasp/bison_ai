Especially in Indonesia's telecommunications industry, there is a change in the use of telecommunications services with a greater need to provide innovative data services. This research aimed to investigate the relationship among transformational leadership, innovative work behavior, performance, and digital literacy (as a moderator of the relationship between innovative work behavior and performance). This illustrates how innovation in technology can serve as a core element to drive the competitiveness of a company, especially in high-tech industries. The role of innovation is becoming increasingly significant and can determine the survival and growth of a company. This study surveyed 230 managerial-level and above employees from three telecommunication companies in Indonesia. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed with LISREL to analyze the data in this quantitative research. The results showed that there was a significant and positive relationship between transformational leadership and innovative work behavior, innovative work behavior was also significantly and positively related to performance, and digital literacy significantly moderated the relationship between innovative work behavior and performance. © IJTech 2019.","Digital literacy; Innovative work behavior; Strategic management; Telecommunication industry; Transformational leadership",,,,,,"Abstein, A., Heidenreich, S., Spieth, P., Innovative Work Behaviour: The Impact of Comprehensive HR System Perceptions and the Role of Work-life Conflict (2014) Industry and Innovation, 21, pp. 91-116; Ahmed, H.M.S., Hybrid E-learning Acceptance Model: Learner Perceptions (2010) Decision Sciences Journal of Innovative Education, 8 (2), pp. 313-346; (2019) Laporan Survei Penetrasi & Profil Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia, , 2018 (Penetration Survey Report & Indonesian Internet User Behavior Profile 2018); Avolio, B.J., Bass, B.M., Individual Consideration Viewed at Multiple Levels of Analysis: A Multi-level Framework for Examining the Diffusion of Transformational Leadership (1995) The Leadership Quarterly, 6 (2), pp. 199-218; Avolio, B.J., Bass, B.M., (2004) MLQ-Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, , Menlo Park, CA: Mind Garden; Bass, B.M., (1985) Leadership and Performance Beyond Expectations, , New York, NY: Free Press; Berawi, M.A., Stimulating Innovation and Creativity: The Way Forward (2017) International Journal of Technology, 8 (1), pp. 1-4; Chang, J., Bai, X., Juan, J., The Influence of Leadership on Product and Process Innovations in China: The Contingent Role of Knowledge Acquisition Capability (2015) Industrial Marketing Management, 50, pp. 18-29; Chen, J., Leung, W.S., Evans, K.P., Are Employee-friendly Workplaces Conducive to Innovation?

Innovation is a key word in the telecommunications industry, where technology development can change market demand and change the habits of telecommunication service users. We focus on innovation work behavior as an antecedent of job satisfaction. Based on personal/ individual factor and environmental factor, we propose two determinants of innovative work behavior that help us to understand how self-efficacy and employee friendly workplace can evolve to facilitate job satisfaction outcomes. We propose that self-efficacy and employee friendly workplace positively affect job satisfaction by creating an innovative work behavior. A 245-employee sample is used to analyze the theoretical model variables’ relationship to innovative work behavior that can change its values to create job satisfaction. The results support the theoretical model, and lead to some implications for the management practice. © BEIESP.","Employee Friendly Workplace; Human Resource Management; Innovative Work Behavior; Self-Efficacy; Strategic Management",,,,,,"Abstein, A., Heidenreich, S., Spieth, P., Innovative work behaviour: The impact of comprehensive HR system perceptions and the role of work-life conflict (2014) Ind.

Adopting new technological advancements will bring benefits but might have a negative impact on current business modes. Adopting new technology leads to the question mark that is it always true that innovation alone will result in organisational sustainability. The focus of the study is to highlight that sustainability is a linkage between the importance of employees work behaviour, their adaptability coupled with technological advancements. Furthermore, other factors such as employee self-efficacy, perceived leader’s proficiency, and perceived employee-friendly workplace play a significant role to innovate work behaviour. This conclusion for other factors impacting innovates work behaviour was made based on the survey conducted at various telecommunication companies across Indonesia comprising of 208 participants. Based on the above results, further theoretical and managerial research topics are recommended that will allow predicting organisations growth and sustainability better.

The current technology advancements empower companies to produce creativity and innovation to serve customer needs and expectation. To deliver this challenge, it requires the continuous breakthrough and innovation. To create organization innovation, employee plays the main key, as the main source and the executor of innovation. The organizational environment in knowledge-based industries, especially in the telecommunication industry, it is very dynamic and work activities tend to involve non-standard tasks and complicated non-routines. Routines carried out by organizations may not be able to respond quickly to rapid technological changes, or often experience technical problems that require fast and creative solutions. This study, focused on the innovative work behavior on employee perspective (creative self-efficacy and transformational leadership) and tested the digital literacy role on moderating the relationship between innovative work and employee performance. This study was made based on the survey conducted at various telecommunication companies across Indonesia comprising of 235 participants with managerial level and above. Structural equation modeling (LISREL) was used for data analysis in this quantitative research. The result proved that there was a positive and significant relationship between creative self-efficacy, transformational leadership and innovative work behavior, innovative work behavior was positively related to performance, digital literacy gave significant moderating influences on the relationship between innovative work behavior and performance. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Creative Self-Efficacy; Digital Literacy; Innovative Work Behavior; Strategic Management; Telecommunication Industry; Transformational Leadership",,,,,,"Avolio, B.J., Bass, B.M., Individual consideration viewed at multiple levels of analysis: A multi-level framework for examining the diffusion of transformational leadership (1995) The Leadership Quarterly, 6 (2), pp. 199-218; Avolio, B.J., Bass, B.M., (2004) MLQ—Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, p. 2004. , Menlo Park, CA: Mind Garden; Bass, B.M., (1985) Leadership and Performance beyond Expectations, , Collier Macmillan; Chang, J., Bai, X., Li, J.J., The influence of leadership on product and process innovations in China: The contingent role of knowledge acquisition capability (2015) Industrial Marketing Management, 50, pp. 18-29; Chen, M.H., Chang, Y.Y., Chang, Y.C., Exploring individual-work context fit in affecting employee creativity in technology-based companies (2015) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 98, pp. 1-12; Chiang, Y.H., Hsu, C.C., Hung, K.P., Core self-evaluation and workplace creativity (2014) Journal of Business Research, 67 (7), pp. 1405-1413; Choi, S.B., Kim, K., Ullah, S.E., Kang, S.W., How transformational leadership facilitates innovative behavior of Korean workers: Examining mediating and moderating processes (2016) Personnel Review, 45 (3), pp. 459-479; Craig, J.T., (2015) Antecedents of Individual Innovative Behavior: Examining Transformational Leadership, Creative Climate, Role Ambiguity, Risk Propensity, and Psychological Empowerment, , Alliant International University; de Jong, J., Den Hartog, D., Measuring innovative work behaviour (2010) Creativity and Innovation Management, 19 (1), pp. 23-36; Dörner, N., (2012) Innovative Work Behavior: The Roles of Employee Expectations and Effects on Job Performance, , [Doctoral Thesis, University of St. Gallen 120 ps.

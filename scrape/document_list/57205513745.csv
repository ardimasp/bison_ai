A total of more than 100 million mobile phones have been used by the Indonesian people and approximately 150 million cellular cards have been registered in Indonesia. This is an opportunity for entrepreneurs in the technology field to take advantage of this business opportunity to create applications that use mobile devices such as banking applications. In Indonesia, banking applications have existed since 2007 and continue to grow until now with almost the same features.

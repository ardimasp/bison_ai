With this data, the behavior of android user can be investigated to get some insights. It then can be used to serve the customer by providing appropriate information needed. This study classifies the transactions into four clusters using k-prototypes algorithm. Before grouping, the preprocessing is conducted by filtering, removing the incomplete record data. Moreover, to be more focus, six attributes from thirteen original attributes are eliminated to analyzed. Each clusters are then analyzed to get the some insight information which can be used to the appropriate users. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

They are expected to be having a character, skilful, expert and competent in their study. To accomplish that, the student attendance system are quite strict. Students will get fine for their late or absence at the end of the semester. The problem is the system is still manually managed. It is hard for the student to know their absence status, how much fine that they must pay in real time. The head of study program and head of study majors are also hard to track the problematic student which has a lot of absence attendance. To answer their problem, we proposed the solution using data warehouse development which was first proposed by Kimball for student absence attendance fine at University ABC. This data is analysed using OLAPto provide data visual such as dashboard or report. With this solution, University ABC can process and present the report of Student Absence and Attendance Fine relatively faster. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Conventional shopping culture is shifting to online shopping. Although Indonesian internet users have not all done online shopping (only 29% of people or 26.3 million of the total who have an internet connection, a Mars 2016 survey source), the e-commerce market potential is still very large. This was followed up by the increasing proliferation of e-commerce companies in the business world, both in large and small scale businesses. Millennial groups are increasingly recognized for their influence in the evolution of social media. Millennials are undeniably the biggest part of society who are familiar with digital devices such as cellphones and computers. Social researchers often classify generations born between the 1980s and 2000s as millennials. So it can be said that the millennial generation is the young generation today who are currently in the range of 15-34 years. In America millennials, 97% have computers, 94 have cell phones, and websites as news sources (Marketing Breakthrough Incorp., 2008). In Indonesia, studies and studies on millennial generation have not been done much, even though the total population of Indonesians aged between 15-34 years is currently very large, namely 34.45%. Millennia generation was researched because based on the Mars survey also mentioned that the largest online consumer in Indonesia aged 22-29 years. Therefore, millennials are undeniably the most important market of many products and services. Research evidence shows that millennial groups in finding information related to purchases refer to their friends and this information seeking behavior is facilitated by digital connections. Therefore the aim of this research is to gain a deeper understanding of millennial communication behavior towards purchases and their relationship to online consumer comments. © BEIESP.","Behavior; Consumer comments; Millennial; Online comments; Word of mouth",,,,,,"Kotler, P., Lane, K.K., (2012) Mark Manag, 1; Chen, Y., Xie, J., Online consumer review: Word-of-mouth as a new element of marketing communication mix (2008) Manage Sci, 54 (3), pp. 477-491; Wilson, E.J., Sherrell, D.L., Source effects in communication and persuasion research: A meta-analysis of effect size (1993) J Acad Mark Sci, 21 (2), p. 101; Wiedmann, K.-P., Walsh, G., Mitchell, V.-W., The Mannmaven: An agent for diffusing market information (2001) J Mark Commun, 7 (4), pp. 195-212; Goldsmith, R.E., Clark, R.A., Goldsmith, E.B., Extending the psychological profile of market mavenism (2006) J Consum Behav an Int Res Rev, 5 (5), pp. 411-419; Walsh, G., Gwinner, K.P., Swanson, S.R., What makes mavens tick?

Therefore, the understanding of electronic Word of Mouth (e-WOM) in SNS is crucial. This research aims to examine the impact of social relationship on e-WOM (electronic Word of Mouth) intention of Indonesia’s SNS (Social Networking Sites) users. Having a large population and SNS users, Indonesia has a highly potential market for deploying e-WOM rapidly. There are four variables of social relationship which are predicted as having a significant impact on e-WOM behavior, such as social capital (which consists of 2 dimensions; bridging social capital and bonding social capital variable), trust, identification, and interpersonal influence (which consists of 2 dimension; normative and informational variables).

The approach that used to enhance the sports organizations is sports science, which is a concept that contributes to the development of athletes by collaborating in many fields and studies, such as anatomy, physiology, psychology, engineering, chemistry, etc. The approach of Sport science articulates the technology that blended on all of the approached. Currently, the use of sports technology or science in Indonesia is also very low in all sports categories. Usually, the management and coaches look at player statistics based on manual data or reports to view player statistics periodically. There is still a lack of exploration to use player statistics to be used by coaches to improve the ability of the players and the organization. This research will propose how to develop sports science with a business intelligence approach that used the Kimball data mart approach as decision support in the field of sports so that management and coaches can apply the correct approach to improve the capacity of players and organizational development. The result of this study will provide the model of sports science that can be implemented for a professional sports organization in Indonesia. © 2020 IEEE.","Business intelligence; Decision support systems; Organization; Sport science; Sports","Decision making; Decision support systems; Information management; Research and development management; Data mart; Decision supports; Indonesia; Internal and external factors; Organization decisions; Organizational development; Sport science; Sports technologies; Sports",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

Port Harbor Company is an IT Consulting. Problems that often occur in IT Consulting are related to the project cost, resource management and control of each project. Problems that occur at the Port Harbor Company are poor resource management, spending costs that exceed a predetermined budget and how to see the status of ongoing projects. Using Business Intelligence and the dashboard as a front end will help the project controller and resource management manage resources, manage project costs and monitor ongoing projects. In this study, the development and implementation of Business Intelligence and dashboards using the ASAP method are expected to be more structured and can solve the Port Harbor Company problem. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Business Intelligence; Business Object; ERP; Project Management","Budget control; Competitive intelligence; Controllers; Database systems; Enterprise resource planning; Information analysis; Natural resources management; Ports and harbors; Project management; Resource allocation; Business objects; Design and implementations; Front end; Project control; Project cost; Resource management; Costs",,,,,,"Vaidya, T., Ahirrao, S., Kadam, K., Lugade, K., Business intelligence system for banking and finance (2014) Int.

Maritime security cooperation concept is based on the increase of the quantity and quality of maritime security threats, both traditional and non-traditional. In the last decade, maritime security has shifted more to facing non-traditional threats that utilize marine resources illegally as well as marine ecosystem pollution. Maritime security cooperation is one of the solutions to strengthen sustainable maritime development. It could be done through bilateral, regional and global frameworks by involving navies and coast guards of coastal states in the region. This initiative is in line with the maritime agenda in the Marine and Ocean Resources Conservation and Use in order to achieve sustainable development (SDG 14). Based on its Global Maritime Fulcrum and Ocean Policy, Indonesia has proposed initiatives to establish maritime security cooperation to eradicate IUU Fishing and to prevent pollution at sea, in which both are very relevant to be further developed in the Indian Ocean region to realize common mindset, attitude and action through strategic partnership frameworks in efforts to achieve sustainable development in the maritime domain. © IAEME Publication.","Cooperation; Maritime security; Sustainable maritime development",,,,,,"Ainsley, H., (2015) IWCZMB, Marine Pollution, , National Environment and Planning Agency; Aston, J., (2006) Management Status: Shipping and Oil Spills, , Australian Government: Great Barrier Rief Marine Park Authority; Czechowska, L., (2013) The Concept of Strategic Partnership as An Input in the Modern Alliance Theory, , Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Poland; Djalal, H., (1992) Perjuangan Indonesia Di Bidang Hukum Laut, , Sinar Grafika: Jakarta; Gause, K., U.S. Navy Interoperability with Its High-End Allies, , friends.

However, currently, there is lack of studies to understand the role of digital technology and entrepreneur orientation on influencing the performance of SME’s in Indonesia. This study aims to develop a conceptual model linking entrepreneurial orientation, digital technology capability and SME performance. This study is using Systematic literature review (SLR) method. The result of SLR was used as the based for the concept development. More than 1100 publication published from 2010 to 2019 were screened with entrepreneurial orientation, digital technology and SMEs’ performance as keywords. Finally, 34 journals were included for this review. Based on the review there were three possible relationships in the conceptual model which are (1) there is a positive relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and firm performance; (2) there is a positive relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and digital technology capability and (3) there is a positive relationship between digital technology capability and firm performance. It concludes with the need for further study to find empirical validation of the three relationships. Contribution of this study is giving the conceptual framework that both entrepreneurial orientation and digital technology capability might have important roles to SMEs’ performance in Indonesia. © 2019, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication.

Universities in Indonesia are required to be able to face and adjust to the changes that occurred in the industrial revolution era 4.0. Many universities think that moving lecture material into online or using high-specification computers means that they have taken part in implementing technology-based learning. The lecturer is the most important person who must respond to the changing times. Lecturers are the front guard in education at the university level. In addition to being important to produce quality graduates according to the needs of the times, self-quality renewal is also important for the sustainability of the lecturers' careers. Research conducted on the performance of industrial revolution-based 4.0 lecturers was used as the theme in this study because researchers assumed that lecturers had an important role in the industrial revolution era 4.0 for that the performance of lecturers needed improved in order to produce quality student graduates in accordance with the industrial revolution era 4.0. The performance of lecturers at this time is still a lot that has not been maximized in supporting the industrial revolution 4.0, this situation is possible because many factors influence it.

In the midst of intense competition with vegetable oil producing countries in the world, Indonesia must have international competitiveness which is strongly supported by the technology in order to achieve a sustained competitive advantage. The major purpose of this paper is to examine the direct effect of technological resources to international competitiveness and sustained competitive advantage as well as measure the mediating effect of international competitiveness in the relationship between technological resources and sustained competitive advantage. For these purposes, an empirical survey was conducted with the active participation of 82 palm oil industries in Indonesia. In addition to the survey, in-depth interviews were conducted to follow up the quantitative results. On the basis of path analysis with SmartPLS, technology resources had positive and significant effect to sustained competitive advantage. This study suggests the importance of technological resources in achieving sustained competitive advantage on the part of palm oil industries in developing countries. © IAEME Publication.","Indonesia;

For this major purpose, both dimensions of quantitative and qualitative research were applied including an empirical survey with active participation of 99 private Colleges of Informatics and Computer Management in Indonesia. In addition to the survey, follow up interviews were conducted with the College Heads and Study Program Heads. Results of quantitative data analysis affirm that IT governance had positive and significant mediating effect on the improvement of IT service management. It was also found that the adoption of IT had high positive and significant direct effect on both IT governance and IT governance. This paper suggest the signicance of IT adoption in the efforts of improving IT service management of higher education institutions in both developing and developed countres. © IAEME Publication.","Indonesia;

We analyze the ambiguity attitudes of almost 3,000 students across thirty countries. For gains, we find ambiguity aversion everywhere, while ambiguity aversion is much weaker for losses. Ambiguity attitudes change systematically with probabilities for both gains and losses. Much of the between-country variation can be explained through a fewmacroeconomic characteristics. In contrast, we find massive unexplained variation at the individual level. We also find much unexplained heterogeneity in individual responses to different decision tasks. © 2018 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,,,,,,"Abdellaoui, M., Baillon, A., Placido, L., Wakker, P.P., 'The Rich Domain of Uncertainty: Source Functions and Their Experimental Implementation, ' (2011) American Economic Review, 101, pp. 695-723; Ahn, D., Choi, S., Gale, D., Kariv, S., 'Estimating AmbiguityAversion in a Portfolio Choice Experiment, ' (2014) Quantitative Economics, 5, pp. 195-223; Alary, D., Gollier, C., Treich, N., 'The Effect of Ambiguity Aversion on Insurance and Self-Protection, ' (2013) The Economic Journal, 123, pp. 1188-1202; Allen, M.J., Yen, W.M., (2001) Introduction to Measurement Theory, , (Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press); Ashraf, Q., Galor, O., 'The 'Out of Africa' Hypothesis, Human Genetic Diversity, and Comparative Economic Development, ' (2013) American Economic Review, 103, pp. 1-46; Baillon, A., Bleichrodt, H., 'Testing Ambiguity Models through the Measurement of Probabilities for Gains and Losses, ' (2015) American Economic Journal: Microeconomics, 7, pp. 77-100; Baillon, A., Bleichrodt, H., Keskin, U., l'Haridon, O., Li, C., 'Learning under Ambiguity: An Experiment Using Initial Public Offerings on a Stock Market, ' (2018) Management Science, 64, pp. 2181-2198; Baillon, A., Huang, Z., Selim, A., Wakker, P.P., (2016) 'Measuring Ambiguity Attitudes for All (Natural) Events, ', , Erasmus University Rotlerdam working paper; Baltussen, G., van den Assem, M.J., van Dolder, D., 'Risky Choice in the Limelight, ' (2016) this review, 98, pp. 318-332; Becker, A., Dohmen, T., Enke, B., Falk, A., (2015) 'The Ancient Origins of the Cross-Country Heterogeneity in Risk Preferences, ', , University of Bonn working paper; Berger, L., Bleichrodt, H., Eeckhoudt, L., 'Treatment Decisions under Ambiguity, ' (2013) Journal of Health Economics, 32, pp. 559-569; Binmore, K., Stewart, L., Voorhoeve, A., 'How Much Ambiguity Aversion?'

Design/methodology/approach: Both dimensions of quantitative and qualitative research were applied for the purpose of this study with active participation of 334 school stakeholders, including principals, teachers, parents, and school council members. In addition to the survey, 33 Interviews and FGDs were conducted with the participation of 61 key informants. These were followed by an examination of school documents, including students’ national examination results. Findings: This study concludes that SBM drives the emergence of decision-making authority of principals, the presence of participatory school decision-making, and high involvement of school council for better teaching and learning environments. In turn, effective implementation of SBM policy is associated with healthier teaching−learning environment and better student academic achievements. However, less effective implementation of SBM is due to lack of proper understanding of the school stakeholders that resulted in lower academic achievement. Practical implications: Adequate provisions of training on the part of school council members and school principals are required for significant results of SBM policy and programs for improved teaching–learning environment and increased student achievements. The training focuses on, among others: school leadership, school development planning and changing roles of school leaders under SBM reform. Originality/value: This study builds on global and Indonesian developments of the decentralized education through SBM model. This study is highly significant in addressing the current debates in existing literature about whether or not SBM has resulted in school improvements and higher student achievements. Practically, this study provides adequate insight to educational leaders, policy makers and international donor agencies in demonstrating why SBM is effective in particular school settings as well as why SBM policy and programs are not effectively implemented in other schools that resulted in lower student achievements. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Indonesia; Student achievement",,,,,,"Anderson, W., Site-based management (2006) School Leadership: Handbook for Excellence in Student Learning, pp. 223-244. , Smith, S.C. and Piele, P.K.,(Eds), Sage, London; Bandur, A., School-based management developments and partnership (2012) International Journal of Educational Development, 32 (2), pp. 316-328; Bandur, A., School-based management developments: impacts and challenges (2012) Journal of Educational Administration, 50 (6), pp. 845-873; Bandur, A., Djerubu, D., Moving towards better school improvement in SBM schools: communication is the key (2013) The Asian Journal of Educational Research and Synergy, 5 (1-2), pp. 1-14; Bandur, A., Gamage, D.T., School-based management policies and programs: improving teaching-learning environments and student achievements in Indonesia (2009) Education and Society, 27 (2), pp. 51-76; Bandur, A., Gamage, D.T., How did school councils in Indonesia improve teaching/learning environments and student achievements?

Design/methodology/approach: The paper employed a mixed-method research design comprising an extensive empirical survey followed by semi-structured and focused group interviews and examination of relevant documents. The data reported here are on the basis of an empirical survey involving 504 school council members from Ngada-Flores, followed by 42 interviews and focus group discussion (FGD) with all relevant stakeholders. Findings: The research findings demonstrate how devolution of power and authority to school level can create partnership in participatory school decision making in terms of setting a school mission, shared-vision, annual programs, school budget, school textbooks, school buildings, school-based curriculum and even students' discipline policies. In turn, devolving power and authority to school level has created several changes in schools, including in-school culture changes, and increased participation of school communities. These factors have led to the improvements in teaching-learning environments and student achievements. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this study are specific to the context of Ngada-Flores, Indonesia. The possibility for the general applicability of the findings is limited by the scope, the sample, and the cultural context of this study. Accordingly, even though there could be common features, the findings may not have general applicability to other systems. Practical implications: The paper suggests that capacity building in school level is required for the effective implementation of SBM policies and programs, including in-service training, regular professional development sessions and workshops on effective school leadership and management, as well as school development planning. Originality/value: This paper could be significant because of the absence of similar studies in the Indonesian context. The findings could be helpful in informing practitioners, the local and national authorities and all those interested in school education on how SBM with devolution of power and authority to school-level decision makers assists in-school improvements and student achievements, as well as problems and challenges confronted by school leaders in the implementation of SBM. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Decentralization; Educational administration; Educational policy; Indonesia; School based management; School reform; Schools",,,,,,"Abu-Duhou, I.A., (1999) School-Based Management, , International Institute for Educational Planning (UNESCO), Paris; Allen, T., Building partnership: Lessons from the specialist schools achievement program (SSAP) (2007) School Leadership and Management, 27 (3), pp. 301-312; Anderson, W., Site-based management (2006) School Leadership: Handbook for Excellence in Student Learning, pp. 223-244. , Smith, S.C., Piele, P.K.

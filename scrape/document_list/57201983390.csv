The product quality is strongly influenced by the software development process. Software development company with limited resources is hard to improve the quality of the software produced. The method to be taken is to improve the software development process to achieve maturity level 2. In this study, CMMI-Dev (CMMI for Development) version 1.3 with continuous representation is used as a reference. SCAMPI-C with PST Tool was used to conduct the assessment of the 5 (five) process areas of CMMI level 2. Data were collected by interviews and observations of project documentation and the process of software development. Unapplied practice from assesment then be analyzed using Ishikawa Analysis to find root of the problem refers to the SPF (Software Process Framework) and subsequently use Pareto Analysis to determine the improvements priority. The process which have already good are in the process area PP (Project Planning), CM (Configuration Management), and most of the processes in the area of PMC (Project Monitoring and Control). Software development processes which are need to be improved in the process area with priority PPQA (Process and Product Quality Assurance), REQM (Requirements Management), then PMC (Project Monitoring and Control). The prior improvement from the SPF category were in the order of procedure category and then process category. © 2017 IEEE.","CMMI-Dev; Ishikawa Analysis; Pareto Analysis; SCAMPI; Software Process Framework","Quality assurance; Quality control; CMMI-Dev; Ishikawa Analysis; Pareto analysis; SCAMPI; Software process; Software design",,,,,"Widodo, W., Evaluasi proses pengembangan perangkat lunak pada virtual team development menggunakan cmmi versi 1. 3 (2016) Jurnal Informatika, 10 (1), pp. 1140-1148. , Jan; (2010) CMMI for Development Version 1. 3, , CMMI Product Team Carnegie Mellon University, Hanscom; Liou, J.-C., On improving cmmi in an immature world of software development (2011) Journal of Information Science and Engineering; Kautsarina, Penilaian tingkat kematangan tiga proses area level 2 CMMI versi 1. 2 pada small independent software vendor di Indonesia (studi kasus: Inovasia) (2011) Widyariset, 14 (3), pp. 665-674; Sommerville, I., (2011) Software Engineering Ninth Edition, , Boston: Addison-Wesley; Oslon, T.G., (1993) A Software Process Framework for the Sei Capability Maturity Model: Repeatable Level, , Software Engineering Institute, Pittsburgh; Kneuper, R., (2008) CMMI Inproving Software and System Developmen Processing Using Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI-Dev), , Santa Barbara: Rockynook; Hayes, W., Miluk, G., Ming, L., Glover, M., (2015) Handbook for Conducting Standard CMMI Appraisal Method for Process Improvement (SCAMPI) B and C Appraisals, Version 1. 1, , Hanscom: Carnegie Mellon University; (2016) PIID and SCAMPI Tool (PST), , http://www.kneuper.de/English/PIID-SCAMPI-Tool/, Accessed 12 May 2016; Haughey, D., (2016) Pareto Analysis Step by Step, , https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/pdf/pareto-analysis-step-by-step.pdf, Accessed 01 August 2016",,"Riza L.S.Pranolo A.Wibawa A.P.Junaeti E.Wihardi Y.Hashim U.R.Horng S.-J.Drezewski R.Lim H.S.Chakraborty G.Hernandez L.Nazir S.",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd International Conference on Science in Information Technology, ICSITech 2017","25 October 2017 through 26 October 2017",,134245,,9781509058662,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

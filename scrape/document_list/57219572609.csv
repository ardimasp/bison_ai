A company often has problems to achieve the standardization of Information Technology (IT) services. This study aims to find forms of improvement that can be carried out by the System Change Management division based on the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) version 3 framework in making recommendations for improvement and increasing maturity level measurements based on the value expected by management and evaluating the Continual Service Improvement process already done this time. © 2020 IEEE.","Change management; Information technology infrastructure library (ITIL); IT service management (ITSM)","Banking; Banking institutions; Change management; Evaluation modeling; Good services; Information technology infrastructure library (ITIL); Information technology services; Service improvement; System change; Information management",,,,,"Shrestha, A., Cater-Steel, A., Tan, W.G., Toleman, M., A model to select processes for it service management improvement (2012) ACIS 2012: Proceedings of the 23rd Australasian Conference on Information Systems, pp. 1-10; Iden, J., Eikebrokk, T.R., Implementing it service management: A systematic literature review (2013) Int.

One method that can be shown as an attempt to solve this problem is the development of Western Art Review subject in Visual Communication Design course at Binus University, Indonesia. The main objective of this practice-led project is mostly about changing the general perspective that Western art is not about ‘learning’ art history but more about ‘understanding’ art story. By understanding the fundamental story of art, students will be able to relate the context of Western cultures into their design content. As a result, students manage to apply their knowledge into their artworks by creating illustrations based on specific Western art contexts, colours, and themes. They are also able to apply some famous paintings or artworks from Western art periods into new artworks by using different materials and techniques such as quilled paper art. Hopefully, these practice-led projects will become new methods for art and design students so that they will be able to develop their theoretical knowledge in a creative manner. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Practice-led; Projects; Prototype; Theoretical; Western art",,,,,,"Malins, J., Gray, C., Bunnell, K., (1995) Appropriate Research Methodologies for Artists, Designers and Craftpersons: Research as a Learning Process, p. 3. , Gray’s School of Art, Centre for Research in Art and Design; Schon, D., The Reflective Practitioners (1983) Basic Books; Boyd, J., (2015) Myths, Misconceptions, Problems and Issues in Arts Education, pp. 2-3. , Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia; (2011), http://www.edvardmunch.org/the-scream.jsp, 1893 by Edvard Munch, Present www.EdvardMunch.org; Swift, F., (2014) Museums and Learning, Museum Narratives, Museum of London, , London; Wijaya, H., Reflections on Project: Interactive Book—40 World Faith Objects (2015) (The Significance of Religious Objects in Museums and Secular Lifestyles), p. 18. , University of Westminster; Ambrose, T., Paine, C., (2012) Museum Basics, p. 61. , 3rd edn., Routledge, London; Abbas, K., Hassan, Z.B., (2014) International Journal for Innovation Education and Research, 5; McNiff, S., (2008) Art Based Research, Handbook of the Arts in Qualitative Research: Perspectives, p. 33. , Methodologies, Examples and Issues, edited by J.

As one of the oldest cultures in the world, Chinese culture—which consists of literary arts, architecture, and craft—has diverse philosophical interpretations. A Chinese restaurant, as a place to serve traditional Chinese food in public space, visibly holds a strong connection to Chinese culture. Moreover, art can become an attractive method to deliver aesthetic contents of Chinese philosophy, especially its symbolic interpretation. In a typical Chinese restaurant, the connection between art and tradition is represented through the aesthetic elements that act functionally with their specific and unique characteristics. Therefore, these characteristics can be observed and studied in order to enhance further knowledge about Chinese culture. Furthermore, the theoretical aspects of culture and aesthetic design can also expand the perspective of our contemporary society and relate their understanding about tradition and ethnicity, especially Chinese culture in Indonesia and other countries. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Aesthetic; Chinese culture; Informal education; Interpretation; Philosophy",,,,,,"(2007) Jurnal Historisme, p. 24; , p. 1. , https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/Chinese_symbols_1109.pdf, A British Museum Tour: Journey to the East, The British Museum Partnership, UK (2008-09); (2016) Vocabulary.Com, , https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/restaurant; Velamuriramakrishna, S., Modern thinking turns traditional food into $400 million business—case study: South Beauty Group The Korea Times, , http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2015/09/332_82990.html; http://www.britannica.com/topic/long; , p. 3. , https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/Chinese_symbols_1109.pdf, A British Museum Tour: Journey to the East, The British Museum Partnership, UK (2008-09), Web.

Using Sang Pencerah film by Hanung Bramantyo as study case, we would discuss the background why chiaroscuro has a significant influence in developing reflective interpretation and specific value in film.

This paper will focus on F. Widayanto’s latest works “Drupadi Pandawa Diva” that has surprised the Indonesian art-loving community. As one of the most prominent ceramicist in Indonesia, F. Widayanto has verified his existence in the art fields for more than thirty years. In his 15th solo exhibition, F. Widayanto decided to choose Draupadi—one of the unique and strong characters from the grand epic Mahabharata—as his main subject. Even though epic of Mahabharata was originally come from ancient India, actually there are many versions of this epic around the world. One of the epic adaptations is come from Javanese Wayang (shadow puppet) play. This epic version was influenced by Islamic philosophy that was introduced in Java, Indonesia around the 13th century. Draupadi is a symbol of perfect womanhood: a strong woman who dares to challenge the strength and power of men. Her beautiful figure has inspired F. Widayanto to interpret and explore Draupadi’s character. F. Widayanto merged the original Indian version with Javanese Wayang version in order to produce his own Draupadi character. As a result, he managed to express his understanding and represented ‘figures’ of Draupadi that are lifted out of traditional art. These masterpieces are unique and can be interpreted in a variety of ways depend on the viewers’ perspective. By applying direct observation and literature review as her method, researcher intended to present the significance of ceramic art as an instrument to deliver Indonesian cultural and religious insights in contemporary way. Thus, this research is a case study of aesthetic project that can be used as a reference for future artists, ceramicists, and art connoisseurs in Indonesia and other countries. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

The main issues that will be discussed and emphasised in this paper is about the importance of copies (replicas) and authenticity of the collections that was carried out by English Heritage during the restoration project since for Kenwood House whose artefacts lost and dispersed at auction in 1922, replicas could be considered as a reminder of the originals. Thus, as the custodian, educator, regulator and advisor on the heritage assets, English Heritage aims to bring back the ‘wholeness’ of historic significance of Kenwood House by using both genuine objects and copies to create a more authentic 18th-century setting to support the concept of restoration that implies the returning of property to its original state. By focusing on a critical context for its research methodology, this paper will open to challenge and debate.

Salt, as a source of life and energy, is essential for all living creatures and humankind. It is an important element and commodity of human life and civilisation in the world. Using a practice-based research and experimental art as its methods, this research will focus on how salt as object can be seen as a subject of art. This exploration intended to verify researchers’ contemplation that art and science can be explored without boundaries of scientific perspective. Through this study, researchers worked in team to find answer about life through salt philosophically, one as an artist and one as an observer.

This study is interesting because of two things: First, comic and its adaptation film are created and directed by the same person, Dwi Koendoro; Second, it is the first academic study on film adaptation of Indonesian comic. Through the structural methods by Ferdinand de Saussure and the clock of character theory by Jens Eder, there are some interesting findings. One of those is the names of characters that were not chosen randomly so that they will sound hilarious, instead those name are significant elements to unify the narrative structure in film. An element of comedy in the characters’ name is related with interpretation and moral values. Therefore, as the final results, we are able to conclude that the characters’ names in Sawung Kampret film are fictional being with the symbolisation of humanism. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Comic adaptation; Film; Humanism; Name of characters",,,,,,"Lafevre, P., (2000) Incompatible Visual Ontologies?

On the other hand, modernity is more focused on ratio as the core of civilisation and stressed on emotive aspect as subordinate point. Hanung Bramantyo’s film Sang Pencerah is an ideological reflection of developing civilisation, which based on the classification of binary opposition between emotive aspect as darkness and ratio as enlightenment. Through the structural semiotics of Ferdinand de Saussure as a method, Sang Pencerah film will be studied in order to signify the classification of two opposite eras and their ideological contexts. From the analysis results, researchers found out that Sang Pencerah film was not just presenting a story of K. H. Ahmad Dahlan as a significant character of Islamic history in Indonesia, but far-reaching into a topic of modernism versus tradition in many aspects of life. Definition of the advancement in the film is a linear contrast compares to the Western modernism that emphasises more to ratio. Therefore, Sang Pencerah film is obviously a product of modernism. Hopefully, the outcomes of this research will be useful to enhance social studies in general society, especially in film. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Film; Ideology; Modernism; Structuralism; Tradition",,,,,,"Sugiharto, B., (2013) Untuk Apa Seni, p. 309. , Matahari, Bandung; Sugiharto, B., (2013) Untuk Apa Seni, p. 324. , Matahari, Bandung; Saidi, A.I., Batas Hati dan Rasio Dalam Keyakinan Beragam (2012) Jurnal Sosioteknologi, p. 70. , Ganesha FSRD-ITB, Bandung; http://www.britannica.com/topic/cogito-ergo-sum, Encyclopædia Britannica (2016), 04 March 2016; Giddens, A., (2003) Masyarakat Post Tradisional, p. 8. , ed by Alie Noer, IRCiSoD, Yogyakarta; Saidi, A.I., (2008) Narasi Simbolik Seni Rupa Kontemporer Indonesia, pp. 42-44. , ISACBOOK, Yogyakarta; Saidi, A.I., Batas Hati dan Rasio Dalam Keyakinan Beragam (2012) Jurnal Sosioteknologi, p. 80. , Ganesha FSRD-ITB, Bandung","Puspitasari, D.G.; Fakultas Seni Rupa dan Desain, Indonesia",,,"American Scientific Publishers",,,,,19366612,,,,"English","Adv.

Thus, it is significant to understand how to construct the depth of interpretation and acquire the efficiency of storytelling and aesthetic visual narrative in film. Chiaroscuro is an artistic lighting technique in film that emphasising light as a significant aspect of storytelling and pictorial composition in film. The boundary between dark and light area that is produced can give dramatical effect and emotional depth in film visualisation. By choosing Hanung Bramantyo’s Sang Pencerah as a study case, researchers can identify the narrative structure, role and interpretation of chiaroscuro artistic lighting in film. This research used narrative discourse analysis as the main approach that was based on Gerard Genette’s narrative concept and Charles Sanders Peirce’s semiotics theory. Result of analysing the film shows that Sang Pencerah is a film with linear structure with three chapters, which used the lighting aspect to bind the plot points of story. In conclusion, chiaroscuro in visual narrative of Sang Pencerah film is a manisfestation of cinematic metaphor that was based on cultural value. This value can enhance both the effectivity of storytelling and the aesthetic aspect of film, which also significant to develop uniqueness and identity of Indonesian film. Hopefully, the outcomes of this research can give contribution in film studies, especially in developing knowledge about lighting. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Chiaroscuro; Film; Lighting; Narrative; Storytelling",,,,,,"Malkiewicz, K., (2012) Film Lighting: Talks with Hollywood’s Cinematographers and Gaffers, 1p. , Touchstone, New York; Vacche, A.D., (2009) Chiaroscuro: Caravaggio, Bazin, Storaro, Senses of Cinema, Online Resources, , Retrieved: 22 January 2016; Lally, D., Digital Chiaroscuro: Transforming a Classical Style through Digital Animation, 12p. , Drexel University, Thesis, USA; Pratista, H., (2008) Memahami Film, 79p. , Homerian Pustaka, Yogyakarta; Genette, G., (1995) Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method, 25p. , Cornell University Press, New York; Short, T.L., (2007) Peirce’s Theory of Sign, pp. 215-220. , Cambridge University Press, New York; Pratista, H., (2008) Memahami Film, pp. 46-47. , Homerian Pustaka, Yogyakarta","Puspitasari, D.G.; Fakultas Seni Rupa dan Desain, Indonesia",,,"American Scientific Publishers",,,,,19366612,,,,"English","Adv.

This research will focus on the relation between the founding characters of educational participants with the learning space design based on traditional education system in Indonesia. The learning space design is considered as a structure of signs that has its own interpretation and values, which then led this research to apply semiotics as its analysis method. The significant finding from the analysis is the existence of ideal values behind the founding characters process that can be acknowledged culturally by educational participants as the products of their society. Moreover, the learning space design is not considered as a merely physical material, but more as a mental substance of learning and teaching process. Therefore, based on the findings of research, researchers can conclude that local aspects are essential to be concerned and studied in order to actualise new perspective in Indonesian educational system that is based on traditional and cultural values.

By using Sang Pencerah film that was directed by Hanung Bramantyo as a study case, the focus of research is about the association of reality between past chronicles with modern life and its involvement with the complexity of contemporary issues.

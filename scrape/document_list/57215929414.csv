Despite its vast paddy field and tropical resources, Indonesia still has not achieved food security. This paper explores ideas about how to present artificial intelligence that may increase rice productivity in Indonesia. Current situations of rice cultivation are mentioned start from existing technologies and systems used in Indonesia. Some artificial intelligence concepts are also introduced. Artificial Intelligence use in rice farming is then analyzed which ideas may be applicable to increase efficiency further. Those that are already implemented in rice farming include diseases and pest detection, prediction and estimation, and automated intelligent systems. In the proposed idea section, ideas to increase production are explored. Using advanced technologies may not be suitable for Indonesia's rice farmers. One argument is to minimize the differences in rice yield in different areas or so what we called yield gap. Factors such as weather, water, and harvest date are those with most impacts on the yield gap. It is beneficial to have a model that can predict the optimal planting date of rice since that will maximize the factors before. Among those implemented, a planting calendar prediction on rice-based on rainfall is already developed. However, rainfall is not the only factor. El-Nino occurrences and temperature changes also have a role in deciding when best to plant rice. The author suggests adding those two new variables, making three in total to the earlier neural network model may improve the overall result. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence for rice productivity;

Slowly but sure, IoT enters our experience in all things. Different visions of this IoT are reported and enabling technologies reviewed. What appears is that still significant issues must be faced by the research community. The technology that relates to IoT is still in development until now, and soon it will be used in human life. IoT embraced people to bring welfare and efficiency for every activity, played the role of technology development; IoT also shows people to think and invent more technology for every application such as vehicle and smart cities. Once it was implemented, the IoT will bring efficiency and make the activity more comfortable than before. The development of IoT also creates a vision for everybody, because it opens people's minds to technology development. Smart transportation will also be implemented in every city, and soon it will become a smart city.

X. The study method used is quantitative method by collecting data through questionnaire. The data analysis uses Warp Partial Least Square version 5.0. These results show that supplier and internal integration have no effect on supply chain performance. Supplier, internal, and costumer integration affect the information sharing. Customer and information sharing have an effect on supply chain performance. The current result conclusion is that managers need to improve customer integration and information sharing. © 2019 IEEE.","customer integration; information sharing; internal integration; supplier integration; supply chain performance","Information analysis; Information management; Integration; Sales; Supply chains; Beverage distributions; Customer integrations; Information sharing; Partial least square (PLS); Quantitative method; Supplier integration; Supply chain performance; Supply-chain integration; Information dissemination",,,,,"(2017) Artikel, , http://www.kemenperin.go.id/artikel/17984/Tertinggi,-Kontribusi-Industri-Makanan-dan-Minuman-Capai-34,17-Persen.Agustus, Kementrian Perindustrian Republik Indonesia Retrieved Mei 30 2018 from Kementrian Perindustrian Republik Indonesia:; Wu, I.-L., Chuang, C.-H., Hsu, C.-H., Information sharing and collaborative behaviors in enabling supply chain performance: A social exchange perspective (2014) International Journal of Production Economics, 148, pp. 122-132. , February; Asamoah, D., Andoh-Baidoo, F.K., Agyei-Owusu, B., Examining the relationships between supply chain integration, information sharing, and supply chain performance: A replication study (2016) Twenty-second Americas Conference on Information Systems, , August; Alfalla-Luque, R., Marin-Garcia, J.A., Medina-Lopez, C., An analysis of the direct and mediated effects of employee commitment and supply chain integration on organisational performance (2015) International Journal of Production Economics, 162, pp. 242-257. , April; Tarifa-Fernandez, J., De Burgos-Jimenez, J., Supply chain integration and performance relationship: A moderating effects review (2017) The International Journal of Logistics Management, 28 (4), pp. 1243-1271. , November; Ataseven, C., Nair, A., Assessment of supply chain integration and performance relationships: A meta-analytic investigation of the literature (2017) International Journal of Production Economics, 185, pp. 252-265. , March; Rafaela, A.L., Juan, A.G., Carmen, M.L., An analysis of the direct and mediated effects of employee commitment and supply chain integration on organisational performance (2015) International Journal of Production Economics, 162, pp. 242-257. , April; He, Y., Lai, K.K., Sun, H., Chen, Y., The impact of supplier integration on customer integration and new product performance: The mediating role of manufacturing flexibility under trust theory (2014) International Journal of Production Economics, 147, pp. 260-270. , January; Vanpoucke, E., Vereecke, A., Wetzels, M., Developing supplier integration capabilities for sustainable competitive advantage: A dynamic capabilities approach (2014) Journal of Operations Management, 32 (7-8), pp. 446-461. , November; Vermeulen, Y., Niemann, W., Kotze, T., Supply chain integration: A qualitative exploration of perspectives from plastic manufacturers in gauteng (2016) Journal of Transport and Supply Chain Management, 10 (1), pp. 1-13. , January; Saleh, Z.M., Roslin, R.M., Supply chain integration strategy: A conceptual model of supply chain relational capital enabler in the Malaysian food processing industry (2015) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 172, pp. 585-590. , January; Beheshti, H., Hultman, M., Supply chain integration and firm performance: An empirical study of swedish manufacturing firms (2014) Competitiveness Review, 24 (1), pp. 20-31. , January; Chavez, R., Yu, W., Gimenez, C., Fynes, B., Wiengarten, F., Customer integration and operational performance: The mediating role of information quality (2015) Decision Support Systems, 80, pp. 83-95. , December; Chang, W., Ellinger, A.E., Kim, K.K., Franke, G.R., Supply chain integration and firm financial performance: A metaanalysis of positional advantage mediation and moderating factors (2016) European Management Journal, 34 (3), pp. 282-295. , June; Huo, B., Zhao, X., Zhou, H., The effects of competitive environment on supply chain information sharing and performance: An empirical study in China (2014) Production and Operations Management, 23 (4), pp. 552-569. , April; Hudnurkar, M., Jakhar, S., Rathod, U., Factors affecting collaboration in supply chain: A literature review (2014) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 133, pp. 189-202. , May; Dhaigude, A., Kapoor, R., The mediation role of supply chain agility on supply chain orientation-supply chain performance link (2017) Journal of Decision Systems, 26 (3), pp. 275-293. , July; Chatzoudes, D., Chatzoglou, P., Supply chain integration (sci) measured from an information sharing perspective: Examining its impact on business success (2015) 2015 IEEE 9th International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS), pp. 52-63. , IEEE.

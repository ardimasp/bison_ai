Medical treatment can not always be done with perfect accuracy. Lung cancer is one of the most deadly disease that prone to misdiagnose. In general, some practitioners tend to read cancer in x-ray rontgen image as tumor this could be fatal. To generate a diagnose, a general practitioner use three kind of examination i.e : patient History, Radiologic examination, phisical examination. In this paper, Gray color for image indexing and retrieval are investigated. The features are derived based on the statistical distribution of Harralick feature from image sample. By utilizing the proposed invariant features, the similarity measure between query and database images provides reliable retrieval results. © 2010 IEEE.","Correlogram Method; Gray color analysis; Gray Level Co-Matrix; Harralick feature","Correlograms; Database images; General practitioners; Gray color; Gray levels; Harralick feature; Image indexing and retrieval; Image samples; Invariant features; Lung Cancer; Medical treatment; Patient history; Rontgen; Similarity measure; Statistical distribution; Artificial intelligence; Biological organs; Color; Diseases; Diagnosis",,,,,"Peterson, M.C., Holbrook, J.H., Hales, D., Smith, N.L., Staker, L.V., Contributions of the history, physical examination, and laboratory investigation in making medical diagnoses (2008) West J Med, 156, pp. 163-165. , Feb; Haralick, R.M., Shanmugan, K., Dinstein, I., Textural features for image classification (1973) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, SMC-3, pp. 610-621; Guojun, L., Multi media data base management system (1999) Multimedia Database Management Systems, , Lu Guojun.

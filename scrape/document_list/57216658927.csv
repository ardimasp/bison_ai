The condition of the human body, e.g. the ECG signal, can be monitored regularly by means of a portable sensor device. The use of the machine learning algorithm would then provide an overview of a patient’s current health on a regular basis compared to a medical doctor’s diagnosis that can only be made during a hospital visit. This work aimed to develop an accurate model for classifying sleep stages by features of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) extracted from Electrocardiogram (ECG). The sleep stages classification can be utilized to predict the sleep stages proportion. Where sleep stages proportion information can provide an insight of human sleep quality. The integration of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was utilized for selecting features and determining the number of hidden nodes. The results were compared to Support Vector Machine (SVM) and ELM methods which are lower than the integration of ELM with PSO. The results of accuracy tests for the combined ELM and PSO were 62.66%, 71.52%, 76.77%, and 82.1% respectively for 6, 4, 3, and 2 classes. To sum up, the classification accuracy can be improved by deploying PSO algorithm for feature selection. © 2021, The Author(s).","Electrocardiogram; Extreme learning machine; Heart rate variability; Particle swarm optimization; Sleep stages",,,,,"039/VR","This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Prototipe dan Aplikasi Monitoring Kualitas Tidur Portabel berbasis Teknologi Cloud Computing dan Machine Learning” or “Portable Sleep Quality Monitoring Prototype and Application based on Cloud Computing Technology and Machine Learning” with contract number: 039/VR.RTT/IV/2019 and contract date: 29 April 2019.","Hirshkowitz, M., National Sleep Foundation 2013 poll (2013) Sleep Heal; Tibbitts, G.M., Sleep disorders: causes, effects, and solutions (2008) Prim Care Clin Off Pract, 35, pp. 817-837; Kales, A., Rechtschaffen, A., (1968) A manual of standardized terminology, techniques and scoring system for sleep stages of human subjects, , U.

This paper presents a hybrid user-collaborative, rule-based filtering recommendation system for education context. User profiles are represented by learning outcome scores and contextual information. The user-collaborative filtering method is used for predicting the targeted student’s learning outcome of a particular course. The predicted learning outcome combined with a set of decision rules are used for recommending some relevant link of learning materials to the targeted student. The initial contextual information which is assessed during the online program entrance test makes it possible for the proposed recommneder system to give automated recommendations to new students. The proposed method was tested using student learning outcome records from BINUS Online repository data. The results of performance evaluation of both recommender system with contextual information which achieves 458.22 MSE and the recommender system without contextual information which achieves 413.19 MSE are not significantly different. However, unlike the latter recommender system, the former recommender system has an advantage mainly that it can be used to give recommendation to the targeted students since their early program stage. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Collaborative filtering; Contextual information; Multi-criteria; Online learning; Recommendation system",,,,,,,"Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: A survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions (2005) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 17 (6), pp. 734-749; Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., (2015) Context-Aware Recommender Systems, pp. 191-226. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4899-7637-6_6, Second ed., Recommender systems handbook; Aher, S.B., Lobo, L.M.R.J., Course (2012) Recommender System in E-Learning, 3 (1), pp. 159-164; Anandakumar, K., Rathipriya, K., Bharathi, A., A Survey on methodologies for personalized (2014) E-Learning Recommender Systems, pp. 4738-4743; Benhamdi, S., Babouri, A., Chiky, R., Personalized recommender system for E-learning environment (2017) Education and Information Technologies, 22 (4), pp. 1455-1477; Bozzon, A., Prandi, G., Valenzise, G., Tagliasacchi, M., A music recommendation system based on semantic audio segments similarity (2008) Proceedings of the IASTED International Conference on Internet and Multimedia Systems and Applications and Visual Communications, pp. 182-187; Cami, B.R., Hassanpour, H., Mashayekhi, H., (2017) A content-based movie recommender system based on temporal user preferences, pp. 121-125. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPIS.2017.8311601; Collins, A.D., Tkaczyk, A., Aizawabeel, J., (2018) A Study of Position Bias in Digital Library Recommender Systems, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06565, February; Corbi, A., Burgos, D., Review of current student-monitoring techniques used in ELearning-focused recommender systems and learning analytics.

Methods used are feature selection of HRV for classification utilizing Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear and with Radial Based Function (RBF) kernel, K Nearest Neigbors (KNN) and RBF Neural Network (RBF NN). SVM with RBF kernel gives better accuracy for almost every feature selected with margin above 20% than SVM linear, while both method also give accuracy result better than with KNN or RBF NN. We conclude that based on this comparison, SVM with RBF kernel is the best method for this classification. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

NPL (Non-Performing Loan) will certainly have an impact on the reduction in the capital of a bank. One good step in reducing the risk of credit default or the emergence of non-performing loans is to take proper care of debtors who begin to experience payment constraints. The main obstacle experienced in bank management, especially in the credit sector, is being unable to identify or detect potential debtors early due to a large amount of data and manual processing. In this study, the debtor payment history is presented as data to predict the existence of problem loans. History payment can be used to predict bad loans. The technic of data mining in this experiment is a new method. The results of research conducted using Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, K-NN, Rule Induction, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Generalized Linear Model, and Gradient Boosted Trees as a comparison then choose the method that has the highest accuracy to be implemented in making additional modules on the core banking system.

The ever-changing factors and variables towards the consideration of credit grant remains a challenge to prevent loss caused by non-performing loans. In the light of the machine learning era, one of the methods that can be applied to solve this problem is by using classification models. Ensemble Method is known for improving better model performance. This paper would focus on assessing the performance of various combination of 7 well-known classification algorithm such as SVC, Decision Tree (CART), Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Extra Trees and XG-Boost.Out of using total 848combination of 1-7 algorithm with 7 meta classifier, this experiment shows that models from stacking ensemble does indeed generally perform better compared to single base-classifier. Assessing the performance between two credit datasets with different product type, the experiment concludes that the most ideal iteration is between 2-5 base-learner combination using SVC as the meta-classifier for this case. This study also suggests the usage of cost function for assessing credit classification problem for its ability to simulate a projection of loss and gain by implementation. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Many researches were carried out on sponsored search where the search query features are taken into account. At an appropriate location the placement of ads leads to CTR value rise which in result increase the customer access growth and also increase the profit for all of the related peoples. So, it means the placement strategy and its efficiency is more important aspect of click through rate. This research work proposes the model which generates the CTR on bases of different dimensions using Avazu mobile adsrate datasets. And from this paper it was concluded that The hourly clicks pattern looks pretty similar every day while in case of days Tuesdays have the greatest number of impressions and clicks, then Wednesdays, followed by Thursdays. Mondays and Fridays have the least number of impressions and clicks. While Tuesdays and Wednesdays have the highest number, of impersonations and ticks, their CTR are amongst the lowermost. Saturdays and Sundays like the uppermost CTR. Seemingly, persons have more period to click over the vacation. It is detected from the investigational consequences that care vector reversion classical is more efficient than the other two models in forecasting click through rate. © 2020 SERSC.","Mobile Advertisement; Rate Prediction",,,,,,,"Abirami, R., Vijaya, M.S., (2012) Stock Price Prediction Using Support Vector Regression, 269, pp. 588-597. , CCIS, Springer Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012; Agarwal, D., Agrawal, R., Khanna, R., Kota, N., Estimating rates of rare events with multiple hierarchies through scalable log-linear models (2010) In Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 213-222; Cheng, H., Cantú-Paz, E., (2010) Personalized Click Prediction in Sponsored Search, , ACM 978-1-60558-889-6/10/02; Chapelle, O., Ya, Z., A dynamic bayesian network click model for web search ranking (2009) WWW ’09: Proceedings of the 18Th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 1-10. , New York, NY, USA.

By relying on CPU processing power, current processing power is depending on the frequency and parallelism of the current CPU device. This means this method will lead to increased power consumption. Current research has shown that by utilize the power of GPU processing power to help CPU to do data processing can compete with parallel CPU processing design but in a more energy-efficient way. The usage of GPU to help CPU on doing general-purpose processing has stimulated the appearance of GPU databases. GPU databases have gained its popularity due to its capabilities to process huge amount of data in seconds. In this paper we have explored the open issues on GPU database and introduce a machine learning model to enhance the GPU memory usage on the system by eliminating unnecessary data processing on GPU as on certain queries, CPU processing still outperforms the GPU processing speed. To achieve this, we develop and implement the proposed approach machine learning algorithm using python 3 languages and OmniSci 4.7 for the database system. The applications are running on Ubuntu Linux environment as the GPU environment and Docker as the CPU environment and the results we find that KNN algorithm performs well for this setup with 0.93 F1-Score value. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Smart sleep monitoring systems have become a solution to tackle this problem, where the system needs to be accessible at any time and condition by multiple users bringing the needs of the high availability and throughput of the system. Containerization has become a trending topic in software development where the container concept has solved many problems of virtual machines such as cost reduction, fewer CPU needed, and CPU utilization has been improved. Many containers have been around since then, and the most famous widely used is Docker. With its extra lightweight, fast, and highly portable characteristics, docker can be run anywhere on all platforms like Linux and Windows distribution. There are so many container orchestrations that can be used to manage docker containers, such as Swarm, Kubernetes, and Nomad. The purpose of this research is to propose Kubernetes as the container orchestration for the implementation in the real-life scenario. The result shows us that Kubernetes gives a good result in availability, flexibility, and scalability compared to the other container orchestration in developing and delivering products. © ICIC International 2020.","Container; Container orchestration; Internet of Things; Kubernetes; Sleep monitoring",,,,,"039/VR","Acknowledgment.

The development of the ballistocardiography (BCG) sensor enables the possibility of dayto-day and portable monitoring at home. The goal of this study is to develop an IoT sleep quality monitoring system using BCG sensors, microcontrollers and cloud servers. The BCG sensor produces ECG data from the physical activity of the patient. The data is sent to the sensor and is read by the microcontroller. The sensor data is collected and pre-processed in the microcontroller. The microcontroller then transmits the data obtained from the BCG sensor to the cloud server for further analysis, i.e. to assess the sleep quality. The assessment of data transmission efficiency and resource consumption is carried out in this paper. The findings of the evaluation show that the proposed method achieves higher efficiency, lower response time and decreases memory usage by up to 77% compared to the conventional method. © 2013 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization.","Ballistocardiography; ECG; HRV; Internet-of-things; Sleep quality",,,,,"039/VR, RTT/IV/2019","This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled ""Prototipe dan Aplikasi Monitoring Kualitas Tidur Portabel berbasis Teknologi Cloud Computing dan Machine Learning"" or ""Portable Sleep Quality Monitoring Prototype and Application based on Cloud Computing Technology and Machine Learning"" with contract number: 039/VR.

This paper is using social media data, social network such as Facebook is able to provide a real-time data. this data can be processed to gain a powerful insight. However, processing social media data have challenge due to the raw text format, therefore the text processing needs to be done in order to make the data readable. In Jakarta, there is an official account which post a traffic condition in Jakarta. In this paper we are getting the post data from this account, do text processing on it and make a reports and dashboard to provide any user insight regarding the traffic data in Jakarta. © 2019 IEEE.","congestion; dashboard; real time; report; social media; text processing","Data handling; Road vehicles; Social networking (online); Text processing; congestion; dashboard; Real time; report; Social media; Traffic congestion",,,,,,"McIntee, J., How to beat the burn-out (1984) Health Soc.

Each year, e-commerce business increasingly popular. Some retail companies finally decided to focus on internet-based sales to get more customers. Along with transactions that continue to be carried out from year to year, transaction data continues to be stored and stacked and of course space consuming. So after years, Business Intelligence is finally appeared and offer great data processing. Without a business intelligence, these stacked big data are useless and wait to be removed because of poor knowledge. Business intelligence turns on the poor knowledge data into rich knowledge data visualization. This paper proposed a data warehouse that can be used to build a business intelligent with utilize information obtained from the history of transactions. To build up this business intelligent, authors uses methodology steps by Kimball which consists 4 steps of dimensional design process.

If marketing performance is good, then the company will also develop well. But in today's conditions, we often find that marketing motivation is often overlooked or not too cared for. So that performance decreases and will be very detrimental to the company. However, marketing motivation needs to be improved by determining the top marketers through a bonus system. Where the use of data warehouse will be carried out as the best Decision Support System (DSS) for manager in determining the top marketers.

Our result illustrates that the support vector machine has a 0.92 (92%) accuracy value and a 0.927 (92.7%) precision value. The support vector machine has the highest result, when compared with other classification algorithms. Our novel method uses a static analysis to extract the function call based sensitive function list correctly and not just as a keyword. The source codes that read as a bag of words or read with neuro linguistic programming are prone to a false positive detection. This is because the source code language has different structures compared with the regular language. The source code uses a static analysis to extract its abstract syntax tree structures. © ICIC International 2019.","Classification; Function call; Static analysis; Web shell backdoor",,,,,,,"Christianini, N., Shawe-Taylor, J., (2000) An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-Based Learning Methods, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Hagen, B., Behrens, S., (2013) Web Shell Detection Using Neopi; Canali, D., Balzarotti, D., Francillon, A., The role of web hosting providers in detecting compromised websites (2013) Proc. of the 22Nd International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 177-188; Chess, B., West, J., (2007) Secure Programming with Static Analysis, Pearson Education; Cooper, K., Torczon, L., (2011) Engineering a Compiler, , Elsevier; (2011) Php Shell Detector: Web Shell Detection Tool; (2013) R-Fx Network, Linux Malware Detect; Grune, D., van Reeuwijk, K., Bal, H.E., Jacobs, C.J.H., Langendoen, K., (2012) Modern Compiler Design, , Springer Science & Business Media; Hagan, M.T., Demuth, H.B., Beale, M.H., (1996) Neural Network Design, , Pws Pub., Boston; Kim, J., Yoo, D.-H., Jang, H., Jeong, K., Webshark 1.0: A benchmark collection for malicious web shell detection (2015) Journal of Information Processing Systems, 11 (2), pp. 229-238; Xu, M., Chen, X., Hu, Y., Design of software to search ASP web shell (2012) Procedia Engineering, 29, pp. 123-127; (2018) Web Server Survey, 2018. , January; Rish, I., An empirical study of the naive Bayes classifier (2001) IJCAI 2001 Workshop on Empirical Methods in Artificial Intelligence, 3, pp. 41-46; Safavian, S.R., Landgrebe, D., A survey of decision tree classifier methodology (1991) IEEE Trans.

The SLR method analyzed papers published in the range of 2013-2018. Out of the 109 papers this study analyzed indepth 42 papers. The study findings confirmed that most of RS studies still focused on e-commerce, movies, tourists, and more whose most popular RS methods were collaborative filtering and content base. Some studies in RS for online education were mostly focused on scheduling, recommendations for courses, books, prospective students and others. The results of this study found that there are still much opportunities to develop methods and approaches for RS in online learning.

While face attractiveness classification seems to be related to personal preference, building a robust attractiveness classifier is not impossible. There are several studies that have developed a classification system of facial attractiveness using a convolutional neural network and provide satisfactory results. The use of Image-net pre-trained convolutional neural network has been largely used by face-related research, yet none of them are related to facial attractiveness. This study aims to compare the famous deep learning architecture, such as VGG, Inception, and ResNet models. This research also aims to analyze the effect of using the Viola-Jones algorithm, as a preprocessing method, to the classification result of the built model. Viola-Jones algorithm will detect faces in image data, and 2 types of cropping will be done to extract the face region from the image, namely loose-crop and tight-crop. This research produces the highest accuracy value of 82.52% by using ResNet50 model and loose-crop preprocessing method. © 2018 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Face Recognition; Facial Attractiveness","Classification (of information); Convolution; Crops; Data mining; Face recognition; Grading; Neural networks; Classification results; Classification system; Convolutional neural network; Facial attractiveness; Learning architectures; Personal preferences; Pre-processing method; Viola - Jones algorithms; Deep learning",,,,,,"Talamas, S.N., Mavor, K.I., Perrett, D.I., Blinded by beauty: Attractiveness bias and accurate perceptions of academic performance (2016) PLoS One, 11 (2); Foo, Y.Z., Simmons, L.W., Rhodes, G., Predictors of facial attractiveness and health in humans (2017) Sci.

The music director has been using global trend, i.e. radio top music charts to produce favorite song list. This study will utilize data warehouse and business intelligence for PT ABC's marketing and sales strategy, e.g. to improve its service to customers, to increase number of active users and the duration of streaming per user. OLTP data suggested for the data warehouse is the existing streaming transactions, which will be used to analyze customers' most preferred songs. The proposed method to design the data warehouse is using 9-steps from Kimball. The selected process for the data warehouse is customers' streaming and downloading process, with dimensions of location, time and song, with fact less table of the streaming itself. The result of analysis will be customers' most preferred play list based on several parameters, such as customers' locations, streaming hours or days and genre of songs. © 2018 IEEE.","Business Intelligence; Data Warehouse; Decision Making; OLAP Analysis; Star Schema","Competitive intelligence; Data warehouses; Decision making; Information analysis; Pattern recognition; Digital music; Global trends; ITS Services; Number of active users; OLAP Analysis; Sales strategies; Star schema; Sales",,,,,,"Kusek, D., Leonhard, G., (2005) The Future of Music: Manifestofor the Digital Music Revolution; Aguiar, L., Martens, B., Digital music consumption on the Internet: Evidence from clickstream data (2016) Inf.

Nevertheless, the mistakenness in the fulfillment of nutrition still concerned. It happens because an individual does not have much knowledge about the energy content of food and food combination to meet the nutrition requirement. The objectives of this research are to facilitate an individual to obtain the optimum nutrition intake from their daily dietary habit. This paper proposes a Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) algorithm to find the optimum combination of food portion and food option for an individual daily dietary habit. The food data is obtained from 'Tabel Komposisi Pangan Indonesia' book which contains more than 1600 kind of Indonesian food. The results show that BPSO provides an optimum nutrition intake accuracy of 99.14%. Moreover, the nutritionist is already validated that this experiment is succeed in recommending a variation of daily dietary habit that meet an optimum nutrition intake for an individual. Based on this result it can be conducted that BPSO can provide the better accuracy of optimum nutrition intake than Genetic Algorithm (GA), while GA can only provide an optimum nutrition intake accuracy of 97.87%. © 2019 The Authors.

Due to the difference in sleep stage proportion for every person, the collected sleep stage data are imbalanced naturally, which can lead to high probability of misclassification. Various learning method has been developed to classify sleep stage based on electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no researches which consider the imbalanced dataset problem for sleep stage classification. In this research, a classification model of sleep stage based on ECG signal was developed using Weighted Extreme Machine Learning (WELM) to deal with imbalanced learning dataset and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. The research will use the MIT-BIH Polysomnographic Database, which contains 10154 sleep stage annotated ECG data which consist of 17.79%, 38.28%, 4.76%, 1.78%, 6.89%, and 30.5% data of NREM1, NREM2, NREM3, NREM4, REM, and awake stage respectively. From each ECG record, a total of 18 features were extracted and the feature selection process resulted in 10 features which highly affect the sleep stage classification. The proposed model successfully obtained a mean accuracy of 78,78% for REM, NREM and Wake stage classification and 73.09% for Light Sleep, Deep Sleep, REM, and Wake stage classification. © 2019 The Authors.

Quality of service will have an effect on the accomplishment of an organization's aim. Suitable and precise evaluation model will help the vocational high school in arranging a master plan to enhance the quality of education services provided. Kirkpatrick's model became the fundamental framework in this case study. This model was usually utilized to evaluate the impact of corporate training to the development of staff and also the impact to organization performance. In this paper, we perform case study for one of the vocational high school in Jakarta. There is a concern from the school about how to conduct evaluation of the teaching activity, students performance, and institution performance. In this paper, we propose a web-based e-learning system using Kirkpatrick evaluation model to solve this problem. We built the e-learning application using codeigniter framework. From the result, it can be seen that the developed system can provide platform for the school to evaluate the quality of teaching activity based on the students feedback, evaluate the performance of students after attending class, and also evaluate how the trend of institution performance year by year. © 2018 IEEE.","codeigniter; e-learning; Kirkpatrick model; software engineering","Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Education computing; Information management; Personnel training; Quality of service; Software engineering; Students; Websites; codeigniter; e-Learning application; Kirkpatrick modeling; Kirkpatrick's models; Organization performance; Quality of education; Teaching activities; Web-based e-learning systems; Quality control",,,,"Binus University","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The publication of this research work is supported by Bina Nusantara University.","Indonesia, P.R., Peraturan Pemerintah Republik Indonesia nomor 19 tahun 2005 tentang standar nasional pendidikan Departemen Pendidikan Nasional Republik Indonesia, 2005; Mathison, S., (2005) Encyclopedia of Evaluation, , Sage; Praslova, L., Adaptation of Kirkpatricks four level model of training criteria to assessment of learning outcomes and program evaluation in Higher Education (2010) Educ.

In this institution, each component has responsibility to manage their own finance and budgeting. Based on this case, they need a solution to summarize the amount and absorption of the budget in every component. This paper proposes a solution to design a data warehouse model to process and analyse the down payment administration data. The nine steps design methodology for developing data warehouse is implemented in this work. This paper aims to bring some benefit for The Constitutional Court, especially in form of information about down payment absorption for every component each year.

But there are still some part that still has opportunity to improve. This research proposed the solution that can improve the plagiarism detection technique that can detect not only copy paste form but more advance than that. The proposed solution is using Winnowing with some addition process in pre-processing stage.

For public sector, ITG implementation is difficult because it is complex than ITG in the private sector. It is therefore necessary to have ITG mechanisms that align public sector needs especially in creating public value. The literature in ITG implementation in the public sector still does not discuss the ITG mechanisms implementation that align with IT strategy to create public value. Using Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we find key practices in ITG mechanisms that align with IT strategy in the public sector. These key practices are the basis of the conceptual model of the relationship between IT G mechanisms, strategic IT alignment, and effective public value. © 2017 IEEE.","IT Governance Mechanisms; Public Value; Strategic IT Alignment","Conceptual model; Information technology governance; IT alignment; IT governance; IT strategies; Private sectors; Public values; Systematic literature review (SLR); Information management",,,,,,"Ross, J.W., Sebastian, I.M., Beath, C., Scantlebury, S., Mocker, M., Fonstad, N., (2016) Designing Digital Organizations; Weil, P., Ross, J.W., (2004) IT Governance: How Top Performers Manage IT Decision Rights for Superior Results; Peterson, R., Crafting information technology governance (2004) Inf.

During sleep, people can stop breathing for a moment that causes the body lack of oxygen that lasts for several seconds to minutes even until the range of hours. If it happens for a long period, it can result in more serious diseases, e.g. high blood pressure, heart failure, stroke, diabetes, etc. Sleep apnea can be prevented by identifying the indication of sleep apnea itself from ECG, EEG, or other signals to perform early prevention. The purpose of this study is to build a classification model to identify sleep disorders from the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features that can be obtained with Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. In this study, HRV features were processed using several classification methods, i.e. ANN, KNN, N-Bayes and SVM linear Methods. The classification is performed using subject-specific scheme and subject-independent scheme. The simulation results show that the SVM method achieves higher accuracy other than three other methods in identifying sleep apnea. While, time domain features shows the most dominant performance among the HRV features. © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Our novel method successfully restructured the PHP parser and reduced grammar artifact objects that must be visited in a taint analysis process by up to 52% grammar variation. Taint analysis is an analysis that detects any injection vulnerability pattern in source code. The analysis identifies the information flow of untrustworthy input that affects the sensitive sink or part of the system. The static taint analysis was run on an abstract syntax tree and traversed all nodes. A static taint analysis uses a parser to traverse abstract syntax trees of the source code. A web PHP parser has 140 grammar combinations in an abstract syntax tree, which has to be traversed to recognize the tainted flow pattern. Additionally, there are many variations of syntax and coding styles for tainted flow patterns. Therefore, the amount of combinations will consume many computation resources. © 2018 The Authors.

Sleep disorder may increase the risk of developing chronic physical and mental illnesses such as heart failure, coronary heart disease, depression, and bipolar disorder. In addition, sleep disorder also decreases work productivity and increases the risk of traffic accidents. The problem of sleep disorder is usually associated with the irregularity in sleep cycles. People need to get the right proportion of every stages and sufficient number of cycles to obtain a quality sleep. The aim of this study is to examine distinctive features related to sleep stages (wake, light sleep, deep sleep) from heart rate variability (HRV), and evaluate their usefulness to classify sleep stages. We utilize support vector machine (SVM) to classify the sleep stages classification and compare the result with conventional methods. We also utilize particle swarm optimization (PSO) for feature selection. The simulation results show that our proposed sleep classification with SVM and PSO can improve the accuracy of sleep stage classification. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Cardiology; Diseases; Heart; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machines; Bipolar disorder; Conventional methods; Coronary heart disease; Heart rate variability; Number of cycles; Sleep disorders; Sleep stages classifications; Work productivity; Sleep research",,,,,,"Moorcroft, W.H., Belcher, P., (2003) Understanding Sleep and Dreaming, , Springer; Beecroft, J.M., Ward, M., Younes, M., Crombach, S., Smith, O., Hanly, P.J., Sleep monitoring in the intensive care unit: Comparison of nurse assessment, actigraphy and polysomnography (2008) Intensive Care Med., 34 (11), p. 20762083; Surantha, N., Kusuma, G.P., Isa, S.M., Internet of things for sleep quality monitoring system: A survey (2016) Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems (KICSS), 2016 11th International Conference on, p. 16; Werteni, H., Yacoub, S., Ellouze, N., An automatic sleep-wake classifier using ECG signals (2014) Int.

Imbalanced nutrition increases risk of health problems. Balanced nutrition means the difference between nutrition needed and nutrition intake must be as minimum as possible. The condition in Indonesian, many people consume food with high carbohydrate; whereas nutrition consists of protein, carbohydrate, and fat. That nutrition obtains from five foods category, namely: main dish (MP), vegetable side dish (LN), meat (LH), vegetable (SY), and fruit (BH). Therefore, it needs a system to provide a suggestion for balanced nutrition. This research used Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) to obtain optimal nutrition, which contains five dimensions (MP, LH, LN, SY, BH). These dimension and variable are represented as food source, which will be optimized by bees. These bees are divided into employee bee (BN), onlooker bee (SN), and scout bee. BN will produce new food source, where if new food source has a better solution, it will replace the old one. SN performers based on the fitness value of each food source; if the food source has high probability, SN will produce new food source. While scout bee will determine a new food source, if the number of trials for releasing a food source is equal to the value of 'limit'. The performance of ABC evaluated using twelve data of men and female. The result shows that ABC achieve 99.90% in giving a recommendation for portion and type of foods a day. © 2016 IEEE.","Artificial Bee Colony; Computational Intelligence; Daily Nutrition; Food Recommendation; Optimization","Artificial intelligence; Carbohydrates; Health risks; Optimization; Vegetables; Artificial bee colonies; Artificial bee colonies (ABC); Fitness values; Food sources; Healthy lifestyles; High probability; Nutrition",,,,,,"Kementrian Kesehatan, R.I., (2010) Badan Penelitian Dan Pengembangan Kesehatan (Balitbang), , Riset Kesehatan Dasar (Riskesdas).

Data are obtained from the Badan Pengkajian dan Penerapan Teknologi (BPPT). We implemented two decomposition approach i.e. standard wavelet decomposition and wavelet packet analysis with coif1, coif2, coif3, db2, db3 and haar as the wavelet basis. The level of decomposition on wavelet decomposition begins from 3 to 11, while on wavelet packet analysis starts from the decomposition level 3 to 6. From each subband we extraced the following features: mean, median, skewness, kurtosis, residual energy, energy, standard deviation, and variance. We used k-nearest-neighbor, naive bayes, support vector machine and decision tree as the classifier. The highest accuracy of the wavelet decomposition is 90.41% with db2 as wavelet basis and 11 level of decomposition using support vector machine as the classifier. Wavelet packet analysis approach gives 80.17% accuracy on Haar wavelet basis and 3 level decomposition using decision tree as the classifier. Based on the experimental results, support vector machine and decision tree have better performance than k-nearest-neighbor and Naive Bayes on 77 of total 84 trials. © 2017 Global IT Research Institute - GiRI.","Decision tree; Feature extraction; K-nearest-neighbour; Naive bayes; Support vector machine; Wavelet","Classification (of information); Classifiers; Decision trees; Extraction; Feature extraction; Higher order statistics; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Statistical methods; Support vector machines; Vectors; Wavelet analysis; Decomposition approach; Decomposition level; K-nearest neighbors; K-nearest neighbours; Naive bayes; Optimum feature extraction; Wavelet; Wavelet Packet Analysis; Wavelet decomposition",,,,,,"Yani, F., (2012) Peranan Tanaman Padi Sawah Terhadap Perekonomian di Kabupaten Kampar Propinsi Riau; Enhas, A.R., (2015) Perbedaan Indeks Glikemik Beberapa Menu Makanan Berbahan Dasar Nasi. 2014; Statistik, B.P., (2015) Kepadatan Penduduk Menurut Provinsi 2000-2014, , Diakses pada; Mondal, P., Basu, M., Bhadoria, P.B.S., Critical review of precision agriculture technologies and its scope of adoption in India (2011) Am.

This server will be using HTTP as communication protocol. To enable multiuser application, this server will be multithreaded. However, access to the database file will be synchronized to help prevent database corruption. And, as data-interchange format, JSON will be used.

Wavelet fusion is one of the pan-sharpening methods which combines the higher spatial resolution panchromatic image with the lower resolution multispectral image to create high resolution fused image. Data fusion using multispectral and high spatial resolution panchromatic images are useful for improving classification accuracy. The study area of our research is Bodetabek (Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi) area, Indonesia. Different wavelet bases (Haar, Db2 to Db6, Coif1 to Coif5, and Sym1 to Sym5) were examined to determine the best basis for the data fusion process. This study also examined the effect of wavelet decomposition level to the spatial and spectral quality of the fused image. The experimental results on LANDSAT data show that the best basis for wavelet fusion is Coif5. The classification accuracy assessment on different wavelet decomposition level fused image also demonstrates that the higher wavelet decomposition, the higher spatial quality of the fused image. Although the spectral quality was degraded as the wavelet decomposition level increased, the classification accuracy assessment results show that higher wavelet decomposition level yields better overall classification accuracy (96.28% for eight decomposition level vs 82.77% for two decomposition level). © 2017 Global IT Research Institute - GiRI.","Land cover classification; LANDSAT; Pan-sharpening; Wavelet fusion","Image enhancement; Image fusion; Image resolution; Classification accuracy; Classification accuracy assessments; High spatial resolution; High-resolution fused images; Land cover classification; LANDSAT; Pan-sharpening; Wavelet fusion; Wavelet decomposition",,,,,,"Vivone, G., Alparone, L., Chanussot, J., Dalla Mura, M., Garzelli, A., Licciardi, G.A., Restaino, R., Wald, L., A critical comparison of pansharpening algorithms (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, pp. 191-194. , Quebec City, QC, Canada, 13-18 July; Gharbia, R., Azar, A., Baz, A., Hassanien, A., (2014) Image Fusion Techniques in Remote Sensing, , arXiv Prepr. arXiv ..; Landsat 7 science data users handbook landsat 7 science data users handbook (1972) Science (80-. )., p. 186. , Nasa; Lu, D., Weng, Q., Urban classification using full spectral information of landsat etm imagery in marion county, Indiana (2005) Photogramm.

However, collecting necessary ground truth data for research in this field requires a lot of effort. Therefore, this paper presents a method for constructing estimated ground truth data using classification. This method reduces the workload in collecting remote sensing ground truth data. The contribution of this paper is to prepare and provide estimated Land Cover/Land Use (LULC) ground truth data of Jakarta area using the proposed method. The estimated ground truth data then can be used along with remote sensing image of Jakarta area to form dataset, which can be used for remote sensing research. For the estimated ground truth data to be reliable, the employed classification model have to achieve a reasonably good result. This research compares several algorithms to find the classification model with the best result for this case. The experimental result shows that Neural Network with single hidden layer of 30 neurons achieves best test accuracy of 75.41%. The method of this paper has been successfully implemented to construct LULC dataset of Jakarta area. © 2016 IEEE.","classification; dataset; land cover; land use; remote sensing","Classification (of information); Image reconstruction; Land use; Classification methods; Classification models; dataset; Ground truth data; Hidden layers; Land cover; Land use/land cover; Remote sensing images; Remote sensing",,,,,,"Liu, Y., Cao, G., Sun, Q., Siegel, M., Hyperspectral classification via deep networks and superpixel segmentation (2015) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 36 (13), pp. 3459-3482. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2015.1055607, [Online]; Mnih, V., Hinton, G.E., Learning to detect roads in high-resolution aerial images (2010) Computer Vision-ECCV 2010, pp. 210-223. , Springer; Mnih, V., Hinton, G.E., Learning to label aerial images from noisy data (2012) Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-12), pp. 567-574; Halmy, M.W.A., Gessler, P.E., Hicke, J.A., Salem, B.B., Land use/land cover change detection and prediction in the north-western coastal desert of Egypt using markov-ca (2015) Applied Geography, 63, pp. 101-112. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622815001599, [Online]; Han, H., Yang, C., Song, J., Scenario simulation and the prediction of land use and land cover change in Beijing, China (2015) Sustainability, 7 (4), pp. 4260-4279; Mondal, A., Khare, D., Kundu, S., Mishra, P., Detection of land use change and future prediction with markov chain model in a part of narmada river basin, madhya pradesh (2014) Landscape Ecology and Water Management, Ser.

We chose four spectral bands (1-4) of MODIS data and four spectral bands of spectroradiometer data with same (the most similar) wavelength with chosen MODIS data. In addition to the spectral reflectance measurements, we also measured rice production data from several 7 × 20 plot areas that contain different rice varieties and different fertilizer compositions. The data from spectroradiometer then used for estimating regression model based on two approaches, Principal Component Regression (PCR) and Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR).

Predictive coding is the next step after beat reordering step. The purpose of using predictive coding is to minimize amplitude variance of 2D ECG array so the compression error can be minimize.

There are more than 200 million residents living in the country. As a developing country, Indonesia has several health problems. First, Indonesia has a high value of mortality caused by heart and cardio vascular diseases. One of the major cause is the lack of medical checkup especially for heart monitoring. It is caused by limited number of medical instrumentation e.g. ECG in hospital and public health center. The supporting factor is the small number of cardiologist in Indonesia. There are 365 cardiologists across the country, which is a very small number compared to the 200 million of Indonesia population. Furthermore, they are not distributed evenly in all provinces, but only centered in Jakarta and other capital cities. Therefore, it is difficult for residents to get appropriate heart monitoring. Second, the mortality rate of mother and baby during delivery of the baby in Indonesia is also high. One way to solve this problem is to devise a system where the health clinics in rural areas can perform fetal biometry detection before consulting the results to the expert physicians from other areas.

The classification process is done with reference of original data. The classifying of class membership is not easy when more than one variable are loaded with the same information, and they can be written as a near linear combination of other variables. The standard approach to overcome this problem is dimension reduction. One of the most common forms of dimensionality reduction is the principal component analysis (PCA). The two-dimensional principal component (2DPCA) is often called a variant of principal component. The image matrices were directly treated as 2D matrices; the covariance matrix of image can be constructed directly using the original image matrices. The presence of outliers in the data has been proved to pose a serious problem in dimension reduction. The first component consisting of the greatest variation is often pushed toward the anomalous observations. The robust minimizing vector variance (MW) combined with two dimensional projection approach is used for solving the problem. The computation experiment shows the robust method has the good performances for matrix data classification. © 2014 IEEE.","2DPCA; outlier; PCA; robust; sensitivity; vector variance; wishart distribution","Classification (of information); Covariance matrix; Data reduction; Matrix algebra; Problem solving; Statistics; 2DPCA; outlier; PCA; robust; sensitivity; Vector variances; Wishart distribution; Principal component analysis",,,,,,"Herwindiati, D.E., Djauhari, M.A., Mashuri, M., Robust multivariate outlier labeling (2007) J.

Discriminant Analysis for multiple groups is often done. This method relies on the sample averages and covariance matrices computed from the training sample. Since sample averages and covariance matrices are not robust, it has been proposed to use robust estimators and covariance instead. In order to obtain a robust procedure with high breakdown point for discriminant analysis, the classical estimators are replaced by Feasible Solution Algorithm (FSA). The input data is a time-series of Landsat 8 Normalize Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The classification process is guided over two steps, training and classification. The purpose of the training step is to produce discriminant functions using FSA estimators, and the purpose of the classification step is to classify rice fields, water, buildings and bare land areas. The aim of this paper is to measure the accuracy of Classic and Robust Discriminant Analysis to classify the rice fields, water, buildings and bare land areas from Landsat 8 NDVI time series. © 2014 IEEE.","discriminant analysis; feasible solution algorithm (FSA); high breakdown point; normalize difference vegetation index (NDVI); outlier; robust discriminant analysis","Algorithms; Covariance matrix; Discriminant analysis; Matrix algebra; Remote sensing; Time series; Vegetation; Classical estimators; Classification process; Discriminant functions; Feasible solution; High breakdown point; outlier; Remote sensing data; Vegetation index; Time series analysis",,,,,,"Filzmoser, F., Joossens, K., Croux, C., Multiple group linear discriminant analysis: Robustness and error rate (2006) Proceedings in Computational Statistics, pp. 521-532; (2013) Using Multivariate Statistics, , 6th ed., Pearson, B.

The implementation of 3D SPIHT decorrelates three types of redundancy that commonly found on a multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signal i.e. intra-beat, inter-beat, and inter-lead redundancies. To optimize overall compression performance we also proposed beat reordering and residual calculation technique. Beat reordering rearranges beat order in 2D ECG array based on the similarity between adjacent beats. This rearrangement reduces variances between adjacent beats so that the 2D ECG array contains less high frequency component. Residual calculation optimizes required storage usage further by minimizing amplitude variance of 2D ECG array. The experiments on selected records from St Petersburg INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia Database show that proposed method gives relatively low distortion at compression rate 8 and 16. © 2014 IEEE.",,,,,,,,"Said, A., Pearlman, W.A.A., A new, fast, and efficient image codec based on set partitioning in hierarchical trees (1996) IEEE Trans.

The purpose of the training step is to determine the reference spectra of the vegetation area, and the purpose of the classification step is to classify Jakarta areas as either vegetation or nonvegetation. An efficient robust approach is used to classify the Jakarta area using the anomolous digital number resulting from a failed instrument. This paper discusses the application of an efficient and effective robust method to classify the remote sensing data with anomolous or inconsistent observations.

First, automatic sleep stage classification based on ECG signal; second, arrhythmia classification. An effective ECG signal compression method based on two-dimensional wavelet transform which employs set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) and beat reordering technique used to compress the ECG signal. This method utilizes the redundancy between adjacent samples and adjacent beats. Beat reordering rearranges beat order in 2D (2 dimension) ECG array based on the similarity between adjacent beats. The experimental results show that the proposed method yields relatively low distortion at high compression rate. The experimental results also show that the accuracy of sleep stage classification and arrhythmia classification using reconstructed ECG signal from proposed method is comparable to the original signal. The proposed method preserved signal characteristics for the automatic sleep stage and arrhythmia classification problems.","ECG compression; Multirate signal processing; Set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT); Wavelet transform","Diseases; Electrocardiography; Forestry; Signal analysis; Signal reconstruction; Sleep research; Wavelet transforms; Arrhythmia classification; ECG compression; Electrocardiogram signal; High compressions; Multirate signal processing; Performance analysis; Set partitioning in hierarchical tree; Signal characteristic; Biomedical signal processing; Diseases; Forestry",,,,,,"Chaudhuri, S., Tanmay, D., Duttagupta, S., (2009) AEE Embulation Analysis in Wearable ECG.

This method utilizes the redundancy between adjacent samples and adjacent beats. Beat reordering rearranges beat order in 2D (2 dimension) ECG array based on the similarity between adjacent beats. The experimental results show that the proposed method yields relatively low distortion at high compression rate.

We apply the Stationary Wavelet Transform to decompose ECG signal into wavelet domain. Performance analysis was performed by evaluating Mean Square Error (MSE) and visual inspection over the denoised signal from each algorithm. The experimental result shows that Universal hard thresholding gives the best denoising performance on synthetic ECG signal. This result is consistent with the experiment on real ECG signal. The result shows that soft threshold not always gives better denoising performance; it depends on which wavelet thresholding algorithm was choosen.

Remote Sensing is the process involving an interaction between incident radiation and the targets of interest. The classification process is guided in two steps; training and classification steps. The training step is done to know the reference spectral of vegetation area, and the classification step is carried out to clasify the Jakarta area into the vegetation and the non vegetation area. The hole process of classification is not simple. The main problem is noise. The claud covering area is considered as noise. The classification of large data with noise needs the efficient and effective approach. The aim of the paper is to propose a new robust approach, the Modified MVV, to classify the vegetation area of Jakarta. The Modified MVV is the modified data subset having minimum of a square of length of a parallelotope diagonal. The good properties of Modified MVV are the consistent estimator and the more efficient computational time than is of MVV.","Breakdown point; Consistent estimator; Minimum vector variance; Outlier; Remote sensing","Breakdown points; Case classification; Classification process; Computational time; Consistent estimators; Data subsets; Incident radiation; Jakarta; Large data; Minimum vector variance; Outlier; Remote sensing data; Robust approaches; Robust classification; Targets of interest; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Classification (of information)",,,,,,"Angiulli, F., Pizzuti, C., Outlier mining in large high-dimensional data sets (2005) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 17 (2), pp. 203-215. , DOI 10.1109/TKDE.2005.31; Billor, N., Hadi, A.S., Velleman, P.F., BACON: Blocked adaptive computationally efficient outlier nominators (2000) Journal of Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, 34, pp. 279-298; Djauhari, M.A., Improved monitoring of multivariate process variability (2005) Journal of Quality Technology, 37 (1), pp. 32-39; Grubbs, F.E., Procedures for detecting outlying observations samples (1969) Technometrics, 11, pp. 1-21; Hadi, A.S., Identifying multivariate outlier in multivariate data (1992) Journal of Royal Statistical Society B, 53 (3), pp. 761-771; Hampel, F.R., Ronchetti, E.M., Rousseuw, P.J., Stahel, W.A., (1985) Robust Statistics, , John Wiley, New York; Hawkins, D.M., The feasible solution algorithm for the minimum covariance determinant estimator in multivariate data (1994) Journal of Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, 17, pp. 197-210; Herwindiati, D.E., Djauhari, M.A., Mashuri, M., Robust multivariate outlier labeling (2007) Journal of Communication in Statistics- Simulation and Computation, 36 (6); Hubert, M., Rousseeuw, P.J., Vanden Branden, K., ROBPCA: A new approach to robust principal component analysis (2005) Technometrics, 47 (1), pp. 64-79. , DOI 10.1198/004017004000000563; Irwin, J.O., On a criterion for the rejection of outlying observations (1925) Journal of Biometrics, 17 (3-4), pp. 238-250; Kendall, S.M., Stuart, A., (1979) The Advanced Theory of Statistics, , Charles Griffin & Co Ltd, 2, Fourth Edition, London; (2010) Fundamental of Remote Sensing, , http://www.ccrs.nrcan.gc.ca/index_e.php, 28 January; Rousseeuw, P.J., Multivariate estimation with high breakdown point (1985) Mathematical Statistics and Applications, pp. 283-297. , Paper appered in Grossman W., Pflug G., Vincze I. dan Wertz W., editors, B, D.

The statistics of RR-intervals per epoch with 1 minute duration were used as an input. The combination of features proposed by Chazal and Yilmaz was transformed into orthogonal features using PCA. Cross validation, random sampling, and test on train data were used on model selection. The results of classification using kNN, Naïve- Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) show that PCA features give better classification accuracy compared to Chazal and Yilmaz features.

The data reduction based on the classical PCA is fruitless if outlier is present in the data. The decomposed classical covariance matrix is very sensitive to outlying observations. ROBPCA is an effective PCA method combining two advantages of both projection pursuit and robust covariance estimation. The estimation is computed with the idea of minimum covariance determinant (MCD) of covariance matrix. The limitation of MCD is when covariance determinant almost equal zero. This paper proposes PCA using the minimum vector variance (MVV) as new measure of robust PCA to enhance the result. MVV is defined as a minimization of sum of square length of the diagonal of a parallelotope to determine the location estimator and covariance matrix. The usefulness of MVV is not limited to small or low dimension data set and to non-singular or singular covariance matrix. The MVV algorithm, compared with FMCD algorithm, has a lower computational complexity; the complexity of VV is of order O(p 2). © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Determinant; generalized variance; outlier; principal component analysis; robust; vector variance","Covariance estimation; Determinant; Dimension Data; generalized variance; Linear combinations; Minimum covariance determinant; Outlying observation; PCA method; Projection pursuits; Robust PCA; Robust principal component analysis; Sum of squares; Computational complexity; Covariance matrix; Data reduction; Estimation; Robust control; Wavelet transforms; Principal component analysis",,,,,,"Gnanadesikan, R., (1977) Method for Statistical Data Analysis of Multivariate Observations, , Wiley, New York; Barnett, V., Lewis, T., (1984) Outliers in Statistical Data, , 2nd edn.

Two issues were considered in the proposed methods. The first issue is the possibility of applying the compression process directly to a set of multispectral images, where the standard JPEG should be applied to each individual image. Considering this issue, a compression and decompression method is proposed based on a hybrid of lower bit suppresion and KarhunenLoeve transform and named as KLT Hybrid. The second issue is the possibility of obtaining a general codebook for a bulky of typical data such as a set of hyperspectral images. Considering this issue, another compression and decompression method is proposed based on vector quantization (VQ) where the general codebook is obtained by a proposed fair-share amount method. Four performance indicators were used to evaluate the results. The indicators include compression ratio, root mean square error, maximum absolute error, and signal to noise ratio. The experimental results have shown good performance indication of both methods.","Hyperspectral; Image compression and decompression; JPEG; Multispectral; Spectrometer; Transform coding; Vector quantization","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Error analysis; Optical sensors; Signal to noise ratio; Vector quantization; Vectors; Multispectral imaging; Image compression",,,,,,"Canta, G.R., Poggi, G., Compression of multispectral images by address-predictive vector quantization (1997) Signal Processing: Image Communication, 11, pp. 147-159. , December; Gelli, G., Poggi, G., Compression of multispectral images by spectral classification and transform coding (1999) IEEE Transaction on.

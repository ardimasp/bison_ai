This study aims to find the behavior of Indonesian Stock Market by empirically investigating its volatility pattern using daily return series. In order to find more evidences, this study examines the stock market in certain condition that gave big shocks to the market by examining the condition during the global financial crisis of 2008/2009. We use both symmetric and asymmetric Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) to model the conditional mean and the conditional variance in order to examine asymmetric and leverage effect in Indonesian Stock Market. Using Jakarta Composite Index (JCI) divided into two periods, the first period is from 2001 to 2007, before global financial crisis happened, and the second one includes the financial crisis, from 2001 to 2012. EGARCH (1,1) is found as the best fitting and also the best forecasting performance model in modeling volatility of returns. The market also shows the existence of leverage effect in both periods and this leverage effect increases in period with crisis.","GARCH; Indonesian stock market; Leverage effect; Volatility",,,,,,"Albaity, M., Ahmad, R., Return performance, leverage effect, and volatility spillover in Islamic stock indices evidence from DJIMI, FTSEGII, and KLSI (2011) Investment Management and Financial Innovations, 8 (3); Asteriou, D., Hall, S., (2007) Applied Econometrics: A modern approach using Eviews and Microfit, , Palgrave Macmillan, USA; Angabini, A., Wasiuzzaman, S., GARCH models and the financial crisis - A study of the Malaysian stock market (2011) The International Journal of Applied Economics and Finance, 5 (3), pp. 226-236; Baillie, R.T., DeGennaro, R.P., Stock return and volatility (1990) Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 25 (2), pp. 3-14; Banumathy, K., Azhagaiah, R., Modeling stock market volatility: evidence from India (2015) Managing Global Transitions, 13 (1), pp. 27-42; Bekaert, G., Wu, G., Asymmetric volatility and risk in equity markets (2000) The Review of Financial Studies, 13 (1), pp. 1-42; Bera, A.K., Higgins, M.L., ARCH models: properties, estimation and testing (1993) Journal of Economic Surveys, 7 (4), pp. 307-366; Black, R., Studies in stock price volatility changes (1976) Proceedings of the 1976 Business Meeting of the Business and Economics Statistics Section, pp. 177-181. , American Statistical Association; Chand, S., Kamal, S., Ali, I., Modelling and Volatility Analysis of Share Prices Using arch and garch Models (2012) World Applied Sciences Journal, 19 (1), pp. 77-82; Chou, R.Y., Volatility persistence and stock valuations: some empirical evidence using garch (1988) Journal of Applied Econometrics, 3 (4), pp. 279-294; Christie, A.A., The stochastic behavior of common stock variances: value, leverage and interest rate effects (1982) Journal of Financial Economics, 10, pp. 407-432; Cizek, P., Hardle, W., Weron, R., (2005) Extensions of the GARCH model, , Humboldt University of Berlin; Diebold, F.X., Modelling the persistence of conditional variances: A comment (1986) Econometric Reviews, 5, pp. 51-56; Engle, R., Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity with estimates of variance of United Kingdom inflation (1982) In: Econometrica, 50 (4), pp. 987-1008; Guidi, F., Gupta, R., Forecasting volatility of the ASEAN-5 stocks markets: a nonlinear approach with non-normal errors (2012) Discussion Papers Finance, (14). , Griffith Business School; (2012) IDX Fact Book 2012, , Indonesia Stock Exchange; Kenneth, A.T., Relationship between Volatility and Expected Returnsin Two Emerging Markets (2013) Business and Economics Journal, 84, pp. 1-7; Lamoureux, G.C., Lastrapes, W.D., Heteroskedasticityin stock return data: volume versus GARCH effects (1990) Journal of Finance, 45, pp. 221-229; Lestano, Sucito, J., Spillover Volatilitas Pasar Saham Indonesia dan Singapura Periode 2001-2005 (2010) Jurnal Akuntansi dan Keuangan, 12 (1), pp. 17-25; Mizrach, B., (1990) Learning and Conditional Heteroskedasticity in Asset Return, , Mimeo, Department of Finance, The Warthon School,University of Pennsylvania; Nelson, D., Conditional heteroskedasticity in asset returns: a new approach (1991) In: Econometrica, 59 (2), pp. 347-370; Perrelli, R., (2001) Introduction to ARCH and GARCH Models, , Optional TA Handout.

Most patients not only have pain in their body, but also anxiety and depression, and physical fatigue. Therefore, the process of handling cancer must be comprehensive, both from physical and mental and psychological care with the Optimal Healing Environment (OHE) approach. The OHE concept needs to be applied not only in cancer-specific hospitals, but also needs to be applied in comprehensive cancer care facilities to relieve patient pain, fatigue and weakness. This study aims to examine the variable of healing environment applied in Cancer Rehabilitation Center Project. The method used in this research is a comparative study method with qualitative discussion. The results can define the principles parameters of healing environment in cancer rehabilitation design. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Cancer Rehabilitation Centres; Comparative Studies; Design Guidelines; Optimum Healing Environment","Cancer care facilities; Cancer Rehabilitation Centres; Comparative studies; Comparison study; Healing environment; Physical fatigues; Rehabilitation design; Diseases",,,,,"Cancer, , https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer, World Health Organization [Online] [Accessed 18 09 2019]; (2018) Hasil Utama Riskesdas 2018, , http://www.depkes.go.id/resources/download/info-terkini/hasil-riskesdas-2018.pdf, Kementrian Kesehatan Republik Indonesia [Online] [Accessed 18 09 2019]; Gerber, L., (2001) Cancer Rehabilitation into the Future, pp. 975-979; Geffen, J., Creating Optimal Healing Environments for Patients with Cancer and Their Families: Insights, Challenges, and Lessons Learned from a Decade of Experience (2004) THE JOURNAL of ALTERNATIVE and COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE, 10 (1), pp. 93-102; Okamura, H., Importance of Rehabilitation in Cancer Treatment and Palliative Medicine (2011) Japanese Journal of Clinical Oncology, 41 (6), pp. 733-738; Sakallaris, B.R., Macallister, L., Voss, M., Smith, K., Jonas, W.B., Optimal Healing Environment (2015) Global Advance in Healh and Medicine, 4 (3), pp. 40-45; Card, A.J., Moving beyond the WHO definition of health: A new perspective for an aging World and the emerging era of value-based care (2017) World Med Health Pol, 9 (1), pp. 127-137; Jones, K., Creedy, D., (2012) Health and Human Behaviour; McCartney, G., Popham, F., McMaster, R., Cumbers, A., Defining health and health inequalities (2019) Public Health, 172, pp. 22-30; Leonardi, F., The definition of health: Towards new perspectives (2018) Int J Health Serv, 48 (4), pp. 735-748; Starfield, B., Basic concepts in population health and health care (2001) J Epidemiol Community Health, 55 (7), pp. 452-454; Elliott, S.J., 50 years of medical health geography(ies) of health and wellbeing (2018) Social Science & Medicine, 196, pp. 206-208; Firth, K., Smith, K., Sakallaris, B., Bellanti, D., Crawford, C., Avant, K., Healing, a Concept Analysis (2015) GLOBAL ADVANCES in HEALTH and MEDICINE, 4 (6), pp. 44-50; Nousiainen, M., (2016) Restorative Environment Design; Maggies Cancer Caring Center (2013) ArchDaily, , https://www.archdaily.com/437008/maggies-cancer-caring-center-snohetta?ad_source=search&ad_medium=search_result_all, Snøhetta 14 10 [Online] [Accessed 20 09 2019]; The Architecture and Design of Maggie's Aberdeen, , https://www.maggiescentres.org/our-centres/maggies-aberdeen/architecture-and-design/, Maggie's [Online] [Accessed 20 09 2019]; Livsrum-Cancer Counseling Center / EFFEKT, , https://www.archdaily.com/464296/livsrum-cancer-counseling-center-effekt?ad_source=search&ad_medium=search_result_all, ArchDaily [Online] [Accessed 20 09 2019]; Livsrum-Cancer Counseling Center, , https://archello.com/project/livsrum-cancer-counseling-center, Archello [Online] [Accessed 20 09 2019]; Livsrum Cancer Counselling Centre by EFFEKT, , https://www.dezeen.com/2013/10/12/livsrum-cancer-counselling-centre-by-effekt/, dezeen [Online] [Accessed 20 09 2019]; University of Arizona Cancer Center / ZGF Architects, , https://www.archdaily.com/797911/university-of-arizona-cancer-center-zgf-architects?ad_source=search&ad_medium=search_result_all, ArchDaily [Online] [Accessed 20 09 2019]; ZGF Wraps Arizona Medical Facility in Layer of Creased Metal Panels, , https://www.dezeen.com/2016/10/07/zgf-architects-university-arizona-cancer-centre-creased-metal-panels-phoenix/, dezeen [Online] [Accessed 20 09 2019]; The University of Arizona, the University of Arizona Cancer Center at Dignity Health St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, , https://www.zgf.com/project/ua-cancer-center/, ZGF Architects LLP [Online] [Accessed 20 09 2019]; Hall, E., (1966) The Hidden Dimension","Djimantoro, M.I.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: misnaeni@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

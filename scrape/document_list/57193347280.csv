People with obesity has higher risk exposed to many diseases. An obese adolescent has a chance to become overweight when he matures at a later time. The fact shows that many diseases which formerly experienced only by adults, now also strikes teenagers such as hypertension and type 2 diabetic. This certainly requires a treatment. There are many obesity cases, one of them is caused by overeating. This research aimed to examine the obese and overweight adolescent eating style. The subsequent result indicated all three-dimensional eating style, on which, external eating was the most dominant. It also implied that the obese and overweight adolescents inclined to overeat were motivated by external factors unrelated to physical needs. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Adolescent; Eating Style; Obesity; Overweight",,,,,,"(2014) Global Status Report on Non-Communicable Disease, , 2014, Geneva, Switzerland; (2005), Preventing Chronic Diseases: A Vital Investment: WHO Global Report, Geneva, Switzerland; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease, (2012), http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/Pages/overweight-obesity-statistics.aspx, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES; (2007), RISET KESEHATAN DASAR, Jakarta; (2013), RISET KESEHATAN DASAR, Jakarta; La Rocca, J.D., (2009) The Internet Journal of Allied Health Sciences and Practice, p. 7; (2011) Health Effects of Childhood Obesity, , http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/obesity/facts.htm; Wilborn, C., Beckham, J., Campbell, B., Harvey, T., Galbreath, M., La Bounty, P., Nassar, E., Kreider, R., (2005) J.

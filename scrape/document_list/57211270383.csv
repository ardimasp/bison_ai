A simple butterfly lifecycle algorithm (BLCA) was successfully created by imitating a real butterfly lifecycle in five stages study; preliminary analysis, literature review, input-process-output analysis, logic analysis, and algorithm construction. The algorithm was represented thru activity diagram, pseudo-code, and class diagram. The dummy case of measuring company growth performance used to experimentally test the algorithm. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Risk management; Activity diagram; Class diagrams; Growth performance; Literature reviews; Logic analysis; Preliminary analysis; Process output; Pseudo codes; Systems engineering",,,,,"Dorigo, M., Gambardella, L.M., (1997), 43, pp. 73-81; Karaboga, D., Akay, B., (2009), 214, pp. 108-132; Mirjalili, S., Mirjalili, S.M., Lewis, A., (2014), 69, pp. 46-61; Yang, F.-C., Wang, Y.-P., (2007) Journal of the Chinese Institute of Industrial Engineers, 24, pp. 475-488; Jia, Z., Yan, J., Leung, J.Y.T., Li, K., Chen, H., (2019), 75, pp. 548-561; Utama, D.N., Djatna, T., Hambali, E., Marimin, K.D., (2011) ICACSIS, pp. 177-182; Jovanovic, A., Nicolic, M., Teodorovic, D., (2017) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 77, pp. 329-350; Forsati, R., Keikha, A., Shamsfard, M., (2015) Neurocomputing, 159, pp. 9-26; Utama, D.N., Zaki, F.A., Munjeri, I.J., Putri, N.U., (2016) ICACSIS, pp. 591-596; Brodic, D., Milivojevic, Z., (2011) J.

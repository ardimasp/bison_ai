One of the data is related to business process sales. From this sales data can be used to analyze the condition of a company whether the condition of the company is in a good condition or not. The purpose of this research is to develop a technique to analyze this data from the company. The method used to implement the data analysis in this paper is to design a data warehouse. Use ninestep methodology as the method for design data warehouse and Pentaho as a tool for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), OLAP analysis and reporting data, the results of this research concluded that the implementation of data warehouse for perform data analysis and reporting better and more effective. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data handling; Data warehouses; Information analysis; Insurance; Business Process; Design and implementations; Insurance companies; Design",,,,,"Khan, A., Ehsan, N., Mirza, E., Sarwar, S.Z., Integration between Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Data Warehousing (2012) Procedia Technol., 1, pp. 239-249; Teixeira, J.W., Annibal, L.P., Felipe, J.C., Ciferri, R.R., De A.

Research methods used include literature studies, field studies by conducting observations, interview and study documentation. The approach used to conduct risk management of information technology is a method of Facilitated Risk Analysis Process (FRAP). The results are the discovery of the risks of using information technology. The conclusions of this study demonstrate the application of information technology is good enough because it takes only a little improvement in information technology risk management. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","FRAP; Information technology; Risk management","Analysis process; Application of information technologies; Field studies; FRAP; Information technology risks; Insurance companies; Literature studies; Insurance; Product design; Risk management; Information technology",,,,,"Fern, G., (2009) Don't Risk IT. the British Journal of Administrative Management, , ISSN: 13535188; Hughes, G., Five Steps to IT Risk management Best Practices (2006) Risk Management, 53 (7), p. 34; Kumsuprom, S., Corbitt, B., Pittayachawan, S., ICT Risk management in Organization: Case Studies in Thai Business (2008) Journal:19th Australian Conference On Information System; Masing, E., Tehnical Support: Improving Performance and Reduing Costs With IT Risk Management (2009) Risk Management, 56 (8). , ISSN: 00355593; Pate-Cornell, E., Deleris, L.A., Failure Risks in The Inurance Industry: A Quantitative System Analysis (2009) Risk and Management and Insurance Review, 12 (2), pp. 199-212. , ISSN: 10981616; Peltier, T.R., (2001) Informartion Security Risk Analysis, , 2nd Edition, Auerbach/CRC Press Release, Washingon D.C; Purtell, T., (2007) A New View On it Risk.

The goal of this paper is to analyze the effects of various factors of ergonomics (lighting, layout, color, and sound) affecting the sensory integration of people with autism and how to improve on them, improve the therapy facility’s current ergonomics/design based on its environment, tools, and methods, and investigate the factors and parameters that inhibit development of the kids treated in the therapy facility. The methods involved in this paper include having a survey on the current therapy facility, determine problem statement based on the therapy facility’s condition, develop measurement tools using questionnaires, measurements of the rooms’ sound level, brightness and temperature as well as anthropometric measurements for the kids and the therapists, sampling, collect measurement data and analyze the data, and develop improvements on the therapy facility based on problems/issues faced by the kids and their therapists. Based on the results from the measurements, the therapy facility should have improved soundproofing (around 27-32%), both natural (91%) and artificial lighting (77%) due to the lighting level far from the required minimal brightness of 250 Lux, minimal amount of stimuli especially stimuli related to sound (80.95%), texture (19.05%) and light (14.29%) in order to keep the kids focused, more ergonomic room layout for better comfort for the kids and their therapists as well as more ergonomic seats (9%) and tables (33%). © IAEME Publication.","Autism; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Ergonomics; Ergonomics on Autism Therapy; Ergonomics on Autistic People",,,,,,"(2015) Acoustics of Schools: A Design Guide, , Acoustics & Noise Consultants; Dewi, B., (2015) FisiologiKerja, , http://epitychiaergonomos.blogspot.com/2016/05/fisiologi-kerja-fisiologimerupakan-ilmu.html?m=1; Dillard, B.G., Frazier Schwager, T., Ergonomic equipment investments: Benefits to apparel manufacturers (1997) International Journal of Clothing Science and Technology, 9 (4), pp. 285-300; Giacolini, L., Marti, P., Iacono, I., Game of stimuli (2007) Proceedings of The European Conference on Cognitive Ergonomics 2015 - ECCE '15; Kathiravan, S., Gunarani, G.I., Ergonomic Performance Assessment (EPA) using RULA and REBA for Residential Construction in Tamil Nadu (2018) International Journal of Civil Engineering and Technology, 9 (4), pp. 836-843; (2013) Ergonomics & Human Factors at Work: A Brief Guide, , Health & Safety Executive; Kanakri, S.M.F., (2014) The Impact of Acoustical Environmental Design of Children with Autism; McAllister, K., (2014) The ASD Friendly Classroom-Design Complexity, Challenge and Characteristics; Rakesh, G.K., Roy, S.C., Ergonomic investigation and their effect on productivity of micro, small & medium industry of Jharkhand state (2014) International Journal of Industrial Engineering Research and Development (IJIERD), 5 (3), pp. 01-12. , May June; Meyer, A., Fourie, I., Collaborative information seeking environments benefiting from holistic ergonomics (2015) Library Hi Tech, 33 (3), pp. 439-459. , https://doi.org/10.1108/LHT-06-2015-0062; Christy, V., Ergonomics and employee engagement (2019) International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Technology, 10 (2), pp. 105-109; Nkakini, S.O., Vurasi, N.M., Ergonomic evaluation of lawn mower operation for comfort in rivers state, Nigeria (2015) International Journal of Advanced Research in Engineering and Technology, 6 (7), pp. 43-51; Megiso, T.D., Passengers ergonomics evaluation of locally modified intercity buses Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (2017) International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Technology, 8 (1), pp. 70-80; Nazri, N.A., Ismail, Z., Educational building facilities for children with autism in Malaysia (2016) Jurnal Teknologi, 78 (5-2); (2000) Ergonomics: The Study of Work, , OSHA 3125, US Department of Labor Occupational Safety & Health Administration; How Noise Affects Learning, , https://www.soundproofcow.com/soundproof-a-space-restaurant-office/classroomsoundproofing/; Salunke, P., Kallurkar, S., Nemade, Identifying anthropometric parameters considered for the improvement in ergonomic design of classroom furniture (2015) International Journal of Industrial Engineering Research and Development, 6 (1), pp. 01-13; Turner, D., (2017) Color and Autism, , http://enduratex.blogspot.com/2017/04/color-andautism.html",,,,"IAEME Publication",,,,,09766340,,,,"English","Int.

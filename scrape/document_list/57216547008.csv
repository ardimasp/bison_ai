Augmented reality itself has been used in our life, especially in fields such as Healthcare, Education, Entertainment, Etc. The used of AR create a new experience for its users. In this paper, a system that integrated the usage of AR technology and mobile banking application is proposed. AR technology proposed in this paper is to be developed and implemented in two steps. The first steps used the AR functions to display simple information of their scanned cards (credit cards and debit cards). The second steps used the AR function to scan the surrounding area and show a location point of the nearest ATM and banks. The integration of AR technologies and mobile banking application is done to increase customer satisfaction and experience in using mobile banking application. However, to ensure that this system could be implemented with no to minimize risks and problems, the implementers of this technology has to take some preventive step. © 2020 SERSC.","Augmented reality; Mobile application; Mobile banking; User experience",,,,,,"Suharfin, P., (2018) Perkembangan Teknologi Dan Dampaknya Bagi Kehidupan Bermasyarakat, , https://www.kompasiana.com/putrianasf/5bd4071512ae94038a6a3839/perkembangan-teknologi-dan-dampaknya-bagi-kehidupan-bermasyarakat; Nisaputra, R., (2019) Terus Berkembang, Mobile Banking Dominasi Transaksi Di BCA, , https://infobanknews.com/topnews/terus-berkembang-mobile-banking-dominasi-transaksi-di-bca/, Accessed: 15-Jan-2020; Brooke, S., (2018) How AR is Changing the Dynamics of Customer Experience in Banking, , https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/15411/how-ar-is-changing-the-dynamics-of-customer-experience-in-banking, Accessed: 26-Jan-2020; Baktha, K., Mobile Application Development: All the Steps and Guidelines for Successful Creation of Mobile App (2017) Int.

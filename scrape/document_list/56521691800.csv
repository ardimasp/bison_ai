Hypothesis testing is one test that is often used to obtain the conclusions of the research conducted. One hypothesis testing that is often used is the testing of hypotheses through ANOVA (Box et al., 1978). However, in determining the validity of a hypothesis is obtained, there are assumptions that must be met, namely the assumption of homogeneity range between treatments (Box et al., 1978; Box and Cox, 1964; Gomez and Gomez, 1984; Guerrero, 1993; Mattjik and Made, 2006). Examination of a wide homogeneity assumption has been made in research involving plants, which use a randomized block design. Wide homogeneity assumption was tested using Bartlett test, but from the tests that have been done show no results were less consistent (Box et al., 1978; Box and Cox, 1964; Gomez and Gomez, 1984; Guerrero, 1993; Mattjik and Made, 2006). Transformation Box-Cox used to transform data that is not homogeneous (Box et al., 1978; Box and Cox, 1964). Calculation of the variance range and test computer-based transformation has been compiled using C # programming language. © 2015 The Yenny Sylvia and Djunaidy Santoso.","ANOVA; Assumption of homogeneity of variance; Randomized block design (RAK); Test bartlett; Transformation box-cox",,,,,,"Box, G.E.P., Hunter, W.G., Hunter, J.S., (1978) Statistics for experimenters: An Introduction to Design, Data Analysis and Model Building, p. 653. , 1st Edn., Wiley, New York; Box, G.E.P., Cox, D.R., An analysis of transformations (1964) J.

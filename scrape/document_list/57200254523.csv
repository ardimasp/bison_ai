Three studies in an umbrella of social representation study were conducted involving 155 participants coming from Greater Jakarta and other Indonesia provinces (Study I, a preliminary study for extracting content frames on relationship; Mage = 21.6 years), 610 samples of images captioned with #RelationshipGoals in an online social media - Instagram - originated mostly from Western users (Study II, a content analysis), as well as 367 participants coming from Greater Jakarta (Study III, a survey for Relationship Goals Scale construction; Mage = 22 years). The results showed that there are three main dimensions of relationship goals, namely (1) Psychological Intimacy, (2) Sexual Activity, and (3) Religious Beliefs. It was found that religious belief should be the fourth pillar, not just the influencing factors of the Sternberg's triangular theory of love of romantic relationships. This study was successful in constructing relationship goals scale for the first time in Indonesia, to our best knowledge, which could be used for education and counselling. This present study also empirically indicated that the evolving analyses of Ulrich Beck, Stephanie Coontz, and Eli Finkel, that self-actualization has become the main romantic relationship goal, are perhaps exaggerated, especially in the context of social life of Indonesian. Individualized marriage might not be applicable as the representation of contemporary relationship zeitgeist in Indonesia. This study is pivotal in preventing marital divorce based on salient social meanings on the romantic relationship among young adults. © 2018 ACCENTS.","Psychoinformatics; Relationship goals; Relationship satisfaction;

This present study hypothesized that meaningful work and perceived unethicality of no harm no foul behavior (NHNF) can predict the proneness in positive directions. Simple linear regression analyses on data from 210 employees (122 males, 88 females; Mage=27.96 years old; SDage=5.265 years) in the Greater Area of Jakarta, Indonesia showed that meaningful work, but not NHNF unethicality perception, can predict most of moral emotions proneness. This study provides empirical evidence against speculative claims that meaning, both in the general and work life, contributes to human morality. Corruption can be minimized by improving work meaning. The underlying assumption is that both meaning and morality make up ""a good life"". This article uses an explanation of the work spirituality inspired by religious teachings - which indeed greatly influence the psychological reality of Eastern society, like Indonesian. This study provides optimism for the prevention of unethical behaviors since meaning is an entity that can be constructed and intervened. We need a serious commitment to have appropriate cultural strategies for developing favored meaning.","Corruptive tendency; Ethical psychology; Guilt; Moral emotion; Shame proneness; Work meaning",,,,,,"Abraham, J., Berline, R.P.N., An investigation on organizational charlatan behaviour and moral identity as predictors of shame: Importance for education (2015) Journal of Education and Learning (EduLearn), 9, pp. 135-144; Abraham, J., Gunawan, H., Moral emotions, income sufficiency, family self-sufficiency, and selflessness (2014) Proceedings of the SGEM 2014 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Conferences on Social Sciences and Arts, 1, pp. 241-248. , https://sgemworld.at/ssgemlib/spip.php?article35; Abraham, J., Maulida, A.F., No harm no foul behavior and consumption motivation among Indonesian students (2015) Anima Indonesian Psychological Journal, 30 (4), pp. 163-177; Abraham, J., Pane, M.M., Corruptive tendencies, conscientiousness, and collectivism (2014) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 153, pp. 132-147; Abraham, J., Pradipto, Y.D., Corruption: Its representations and psychology in Indonesia (2016) ACP/ACERP 2016 Official Conference Proceedings, pp. 357-369; Abraham, J., Sharron, Perceived risk of anti-corruption e-learning, email phishing literacy, and anomia (2015) Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering, 331, pp. 577-584; Abraham, J., Takwin, B., Suleeman, J., Counterfeit self: A confirmatory factor analysis among Indonesians (2017) Kasetsart Journal of Social Sciences, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.kjss.2017.07.011, Advance online publication; Al-Khatib, J.A., Vitell, S.J., Rawwas, M.Y.A., Consumer ethics: A cross-cultural investigation (1997) European Journal of Marketing, 31 (11-12), pp. 750-767. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/03090569710190514; Allan, B.A., Autin, K.L., Duffy, R.D., Examining social class and work meaning within the psychology of working framework (2014) Journal of Career Assessment, 22 (4), pp. 543-561; Amarullah, R., Maulana, L., Patronage culture in the middle of bureaucratic reform efforts in Indonesia (2017) Public Policy and Administration Research, 7 (1), pp. 20-30; Arifianto, A., (2001) Corruption in Indonesia: Causes, History, Impacts, and Possible Cures, , Brandeis University; Aronson, E., Wilson, D., Akert, R.M., (2007) Social Psychology, , (6th ed.).

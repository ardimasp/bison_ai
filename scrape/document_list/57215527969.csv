With advanced technological development and usage in Indonesia, it is expected to have a better health index. However, the health index of the population of Indonesia is still relatively low compared to other countries, being placed at 101 out of 149 countries. Few of the causes of the problem above are the lack of health education, delay in diagnosing/misdiagnosis, and inaccessible healthcare facilities. With the increasing popularity of telemedicine across the world and its nation, Indonesia could improve the healthcare and medical field with the said technology. In this paper, a framework is created and designed for an integrated mobile patient portal for practicing physicians and medical clinics for improving in sharing information in consultations. Furthermore, the application also is intended to help outpatients to make a consultation appointment and increasing outpatient's active engagement and knowledge of their health. This mobile application is expected to be implemented across the nation and to improve the health and medical aspect in Indonesia. © 2019 IEEE.","Electronic Health Record; Electronic Medical Record; Mobile patient application","Health care; Medical computing; Telemedicine; Electronic health record; Electronic medical record; Health education; Healthcare facility; Leading indicators; Mobile applications; Sharing information; Technological development; Diagnosis",,,,,"Debora, Y., (2017) Indeks Kesehatan Indonesia Masih Sangat Rendah, , https://tirto.id/indeks-kesehatanindonesia-masih-sangat-rendah-cBRn, 17 December [Online].

Moreover, become a problem for a vulnerable patient such as unconscious patient, disabled or elderly when seeing a new practical doctor and at the end of the day, it will become malpractice.

As learner, teacher presence and teaching method no longer depend upon time and distance, class enrolment also becomes open for more of the populace regardless of educational background. The goal of the research is to design a learning model that is in accordance withdimensions that are compatible withthe MOOC rules. Literature review, a questionnaire, and interviews were used to define dimensions based on the MOOC rules. The research resulted in a model that is in accordance with MOOC categories and dimensions based on input from bothusers and developers. © by Wydawnictwo Adam Marszałek Toruń 2016.","E-learning; Learner oriented; MOOC dimension; MOOC model; Online courses",,,,,,"Cole, R.A., (2000) Issues in Web-based Pedagogy: A Critical Primer, , Westport.

It is intended to support and use technologies especially in the field of education for helping teachers to do presentation with ease. The program is developed by using a science field of computer vision, as well as additional libraries which are: FLTK, OpenGL, and OpenCV. In order to use this program, the presenters need to have a webcam and a projector. The webcam will be used to recognize the shape and the pattern of the presenters' hands. Furthermore, the program will send signals to the computers based on the recognized pattern. The result of this research is a program that can improve the teaching process of teaching/presentation. © 2015 The Authors.

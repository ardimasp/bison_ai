We argue that the concept of strategy has shifted from the competitive strategy into co-creation strategy based on collaboration value. In developing co-creation strategy, the input is derived from external factors associated with customer experience and internal factors related to distinctive capabilities and both focus on core competence development in supply chain management. We use telecommunication firms as our unit analysis with sample of 35 Indonesian Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) firms analysed using Partial Least Square (PLS). The findings show that the developing of co-creation strategy was supported by distinctive capabilities and customer experience. The findings also indicate that co-creation strategy emerges as a key in sustaining business of the firms to focus on developing customer experience and providing distinctive capabilities. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Co-creation strategy; Customer experience; Distinctive capabilities; Supply chain",,,,,,,,"Bolton, R.N., (2016) Service Excellence: Creating Customer Experiences that Build Relationships.

The way organizations manage resources and capability, especially in relationship with people, culture and process in creating new business models have changed. Previous studies on developing innovation based on customer experience and agility of organization focus on the concept, relationship among variables and the implication. However, in the context of industry 5.0, the study on those topics has not been revealing. Hence, this study aims to assess the concept of experience-agility innovation model to support transformation in the context of digital transformation to face Industry 5.0. The proposed model was assessed with 195 Indonesia ICT firms using SEM-PLS statistical tools. The findings demonstrate that the firm that offers compelling value proposition from customer experience while concurrently developing agility in the organization to create business model innovation could boost the transformational performance. For further researches, the study can be enhanced through expanding the model, sample, and time. © BEIESP.","Business model innovation; Customer experience; Industry 5.0; Organizational agility; Transformational performance",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, MHE&SR

Digital leadership will significantly enable sensing market changes, seizing opportunities, and reconfiguring organizations. Previous studies on digital leadership, dynamic capability, and innovation management focus mainly on constructs, benefits, and implications. However, a study on the role of digital leadership based on dynamic capability in fostering innovation and the impact of market orientation have not been thoroughly explored, which is the aim of this study, taking market orientation as a moderating variable. Employing a quantitative methodology, data were collected through online questionnaires, distributed through email and messaging applications to a purposive sample of 88 senior managers of Indonesian telecommunication firms. The results reveal that digital leadership based on dynamic capability impacts directly and indirectly on developing innovation. Market orientation also plays an important role in accelerating innovation. Due to limitations in terms of research model, sample size, and time, further research using larger samples in other industries and countries should be undertaken. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Digital leadership; Dynamic capability; Innovation management; Market orientation; Transformation model",,,,,,,,"Abiodun, B.Y., The Prospects of Accounting and Economic Systems in the Era of Global Knowledge Economy (2014) The Economics and Finance Letters, 1 (2), pp. 9-14; Ahmed, A., Rehan, R., Chhapra, I.U., Supro, S., Interest Rate and Financial Performance of Banks in Pakistan (2018) International Journal of Applied Economics, Finance and Accounting, 2 (1), pp. 1-7; Ali, A., Haseeb, M., Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology as a strategic tool towards higher performance of supply chain operations in textile and apparel industry of Malaysia (2019) Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 7 (2), pp. 215-226; Amfo, P., Cudjoe, G., Acheampong, G., Adams, M., Boakye, E., Market Orientation, Innovation and Business Performance: Insight from Womenpreneurs in the Fashion Industry in Ghana Market Orientation (2018) Journal of Creativity and Business Innovation, 4. , April; Arief, M., Basuki, Y.T., Dynamic capability as a business strategy enhancing the business performance (A conceptual approach) (2015) Advanced Science Letters, 21 (4), pp. 690-694; Basuki, Y.T., Arief, M., Propheto, A., The role of leadership, dynamic capabilities, and organization culture, in company performance of manufacturing industries in Indonesia (Study in food and beverages industries) (2015) Advanced Science Letters, 21 (5), pp. 1141-1145; Berman, S.J., Marshall, A., The next digital transformation: From an individual-centered to an everyone-to-everyone economy (2014) Strategy and Leadership, 42 (5), pp. 9-17; Bessant, J., Phillips, W., Innovation management and dynamic capability (2013) The Sage Handbook of Strategic Supply Manage-Ment: Relationships, Chains, Networks and Sectors, , http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/12488%5Cnhttp://www.sagepub.com/books/Book229482, Retrieved from; Breznik, L., Hisrich, R.D., Dynamic capabilities vs. Innovation capability: Are they related?

One method is to build a culture of innovation. This paper seeks to evaluate the manufacturing industry in Indonesia and analyze whether an innovation culture provides support in improving the performance of the company. Dynamic capability and leadership are also very important factors in improving the performance of a company. A study conducted on 190 food and beverage companies in Indonesia showed that the culture of innovation does not directly provide improve performance of a company, and increased dynamic capability and leadership skills can improve company performance. An increase in innovation culture will affect company performance through the development of dynamic capability. This study is helpful to practitioners in the manufacturing industry to improve performance in economically turbulent conditions. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

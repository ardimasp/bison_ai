The most commonly pavement failures found are potholes and stripping, which are related to water intrusion to the hot mix asphalt (HMA). This research aims to provide an analysis on the moisture susceptibility of HMA with the addition of waterproofing additives, namely the Wetfix-BE, Wetbond-SP, and hydrated lime. The Marshall, Cantabro Loss, and Indirect Tensile Ratio tests were undertaken to assess the performance of the prepared samples. It was found that the specimens that were prepared using hydrated lime, as an alternative and low-cost waterproofing additive, perform reasonably well compared to the specimens that were prepared using the other additives. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,"12/AKM/PNT/2019","This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Analisa Kelembaban Pada Campuran Aspal” with contract number: 12/AKM/PNT/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","Kandhal, P.S., Rickards, I.J., (2001) Premature Failure of Asphalt Overlays from Stripping: Case Histories; Rmeili, E., Scullion, T., Detecting Stripping in Asphalt Concrete Layers Using Ground Penetrating Radar (1997) Transp.

Ravelling, rutting, and potholes are one the pavement failures that are commonly found and those failures are related to the intrusion of moisture onto the asphaltic mixture. This research aims to study the usage of hydrated lime as an additive to improve the moisture susceptibility of the asphaltic mixture. There were two different natural aggregates used in this research project and the prepared specimens were tested by Marshall, Cantabro Loss, and Indirect Tensile Strength tests. From the research results, it was found that hydrated lime was effective in not only improving the moisture susceptibility of the asphaltic mixture, but also increasing the stability and making the asphalt specimens denser. It was also found that it is critical to choose the suitable aggregate to be used in the asphaltic mixture as it can significantly affect the quality of the asphalt specimens. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Aggregate; Cantabro Loss; Hydrated Lime; Indirect Tensile Strength Test; Marshall Test","Aggregates; Asphalt; Hydrated lime; Hydration; Lime; Mixtures; Moisture; Pavements; Hot mix asphalt; Indirect tensile strength; Marshall test; Moisture resistance; Moisture susceptibility; Natural aggregate; Pavement surface; Research results; Tensile strength",,,,"12/AKM/PNT/2019, 225/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019, 039/VR

One of the additives that can be added is Xypex C-1000 NF, which a crystalline material. A number of past studies have shown that this additive is effective in improving the moisture resistance of concrete structure. However, the application of this additive in Indonesia was found to be challenging as the performance of the concrete mixture was not as good as expected. This research aims to evaluate the effect of adding various percentages of this additive, various amount of water to be added to the concrete mixture, and the methods of mixing the materials, which are wet and dry methods, by looking at both the slump value and the compressive strength of the concrete specimens. From the research results, it was found that the methods used to mix the additive matter to produce a desirable concrete quality. The wet mix method is the preferable method as it produces less variations in compressive strength test results regardless of the additional water amount. It was also found that, by using both dry and wet mix methods, the usage of Xypex C-1000 NF can improve the compressive strength value. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","compressive strength; concrete; dry mix; optimum water content; slump value; wet mix","Additives; Compressive strength; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Concrete mixing; Concretes; Mixtures; Moisture; Nanocrystalline materials; Concrete quality; Concrete specimens; Dry mixes; Moisture resistance; Moisture susceptibility; Optimum water content; Research results; Slump value; Concrete mixtures",,,,,,"Hidayat, I., Gunaedi, The influence of fly ash in concrete compressive strength by using expanded polystyrene as a partial substitution of sand (2014) Int.

One of the most important factors of the bridge is the abutment. Abutment is a structure, built at the edge of the bridge. Abutment is designed to hold the weight of the bridge and over the bridge. The structure of abutment usually planted in to the river. One of methods to minimize the scour impact is considering the shape and design of abutment. This research aims to find out the effect of abutment model or shape variation (semi-circular end abutment, wing wall abutment and spill through abutment) toward the change of velocity using Flow-3D for numerical modeling, the physical test to validation the flow condition and analyze the characteristic sediment transport pattern using Hjulstörm curve. The result of research state that the spill through abutment is the most effective model to keep the stability of flow velocity around the abutment. Correlation between Froude Number (Fr) with Relative Longitudinal Distance Ratio is discussed in this paper. Then, Hjulstörm curve shows that with bed material diameter (d 50) of 0,54 mm, sediment transport in the entire abutment model located at erosion zone. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Abutment; Flow-3D; Hjulstrm curve; sediment transport; velocity","Failure (mechanical); Flow velocity; Scour; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Velocity; Bridge failures; Change of velocities; Flow velocity characteristics; FLOW-3D; Hjulstrm curve; Longitudinal distance; Sediment transport pattern; Shape variations; Abutments (bridge)",,,,"12/KM/PNT/2019, 039/VR

Road pavement is an expensive infrastructure, and hence, it is important to ensure that the pavement layers can last until its designed lifetime. Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) pavement is one of the most commonly used type of pavement. However, the HMA pavements are often found with water-related distresses at an early stage, and hence, the pavement will not be able to last, while Indonesia is a tropical country and has a relatively high groundwater level in some major cities. Therefore, it is necessary to study an additive that could help in improving the moisture susceptibility of HMA layers. This study aims to provide an evaluation of moisture susceptibility of HMA pavements with the addition of waterproofing additives, including Wetfix-BE, and Wetbond-SP. Three tests were conducted to assess the moisture susceptibility, which are Marshall, Cantabro Loss, and Indirect Tensile Strength tests. It was found that both additives worked well in helping the HMA samples to be more resistant to water, although the samples with the additional of Wetbond-SP had a better performance than the samples with Wetfix-BE added. © 2019 Author(s).",,,,,,"Binus University: 12/AKM/PNT/2019

The research aims to model dam failure for Mapping Hazard area including inundation height and arrival time. A key scenario for dam failure is partial breach of embankment dam: overtopping and piping. The overtopping shape modeling was simulated in triangle and trapezoidal shapes. The piping failure modeling is simulated as orifice with rectangular shape. This study was conducted by using the integration of hydraulic modeling, which used a numerical method with Navier-Stoke solver and Geographic Information System (GIS) to assess the risks that could be cause by any damages on Dam failure. Flow simulation of the dam break was performed by using ZhongXing HY-21 software and the results were mapped by using the GIS. The result of the research is overtopping failure was selected for the model with peak discharge maximum (Qmax ) is 2089 m3/sec. The fastest arrival time is 0.4 hours (24 minutes). Several villages catagorized as a high-risk area. This inundation hazard map is very important for emergency plan which determines the evacuation routes and coordination scheme with local disaster agency. © BEIESP.","Dam; Emergency; Failure; Hazard; Inundation",,,,,,,"Wang, C., Zhang, S., Tan, Y., Pan, F., Yan, L., Life Loss Estimation Based on Dam-Break Flood Uncertainties nd Lack of Information in Mountainous Regions of Western China (2017) Htrans.

It is a common problem in major cities of Indonesia, especially in Jakarta, to have a road pavement being damaged after the rainy or monsoon season, especially when the pavements were flooded. This research aims to study the effect of moisture on asphaltic surfaces as designed according to Indonesian standards in order to determine the characteristic of the asphaltic mixture. The results of this study could help in identifying the issue(s) that cause the susceptibility of the asphaltic mixture, and hence, in the future, these issues could be handled better.The samples were prepared by using two different natural aggregates and two 60/70 asphalt binders that were sourced from different producers. There were four sample combinations prepared, which were then tested for Marshall, Cantabro Loss, and Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS) tests. The Marshall test was used to determine the stability and the flow of aggregates, while the other tests were used to determine the impact of water or moisture on the prepared samples. It was found that the samples that were prepared using Aggregate 2 had a higher stability and were more resistant to abrasion load after the samples being immersed in the water for one hour (based on the Cantabro Loss test results) than the samples that were prepared using Aggregate 1. However, from the ITS test results, it was found that the samples that were prepared using Aggregate 2 became “weaker” after being immersed in the water for 24 hours compared to the samples that were prepared using Aggregate 1. This could be due to the fact that Aggregate 2 had a higher percentage of water absorption value, which will place in effect after a long period of time. It did not seem to matter when the samples were being immersed for only one hour. It was also found that the Cantabro Loss and ITS test results had an inverse relationship, which could be due to the difference in the immersion time of both tests. © BEIESP.","Cantabro Loss; Hot mix asphalt; Indirect Tensile Strength; Moisture",,,,,,"The authors would like to thank Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education of Indonesia for its support for this research.","Samad, E., SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN FLEXIBLE PAVEMENT PERFORMANCE USING MECHANISTIC EMPIRICAL METHOD (CASE STUDY: CIREBON–LOSARI ROAD SEGMENT, WEST JAVA) (2012) J.

It is very important to ensure that the road networks perform well and last to their designed life. However, it is very common to find roads with asphaltic surfaces with some pavement failures not long after the construction finished. The most commonly pavement failures found are potholes and stripping, which are related to water intrusion to the hot mix asphalt. Indonesia is a tropical country and its soil has a high groundwater level in general. Therefore, it is very important to study the effect of moisture in asphaltic surfaces. This research aims to provide a preliminary analysis on the moisture susceptibility of hot mix asphalt. It was found that there were a few of Marshall test results that did not satisfy the requirements, which could be caused by human variation and the angularity of aggregates. The Cantabro Loss test results show that the HMA specimens lost around 11% and 15% of material after being exposed to water and abraded. From the research results, it was found that there is a strong relationship between the flow and the Cantabro Loss of the prepared HMA specimens. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Using integration of Geometric Information System (GIS) technology and urban storm water models, the performance of urban drainage system can be analysed.[1] Especially in coastal area, the main problem of urban drainage is overloaded capacity because of rapid urbanization and coastal floods caused by storm surges and wave action superimposed on high water levels generated during the cycle of tides. Land use change, watershed area as settlements area, clogged drainage pipe/channel, the changing of imperviousness of land cover also contributes to large volume of surface runoff. Moreover, the developments can change land cover in urban area and increasing rainfall runoff. One of the solutions for coastal urban drainage is by using polder system for flood control. The purpose of this paper is to illustrated how GIS can model the catchment discretization and MIKE URBAN-SWMM (Storm Water Management Model) can analyse water balance based on the rainfall return period of 25, 50 and 100 years. The research shows evaluation result of the polder performance including inundation depth and pump performance by linking GIS between storm water models. The case study is analysing the Pluit polder in Jakarta-Indonesia, which is connected to the Indonesia Central Bank compartment. Based on the model, this polder system can reduce flooding in Indonesia Central Bank Compartment up to 50%, however the inundation is still occurred. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

However, some of these bridges are failed due to channel bed degradation and scouring. Bridge scour is one of the main causes of bridge failure. To prevent this condition, it is very crucial to thoroughly understanding the river behavior changes at the upstream and downstream area of bridge and barrage constructions. After that, the proper operation and preventive maintenance of bridges and barrages can be formulated. In this study, we identified the indicator parameters that are associated with hydraulic channel and potentially scour the bridge. The objective of this study is to develop a scouring assessment based on the river flow regime. In the assessment, the structures is the indicators status and the performance of the bridge component which will be measured in order to assess the bridge failures performance, and recommendations are proposed to obtain the results by using visual inspection method. The assessment models is an evaluation of the river regime condition using inspection and other direct measures to determine the effect of river condition related with deterioration. The study result shows that the main component to assess the performance of bridge are hydraulic channel, riverbank, and floodplain. The assessment is conducted at the upstream and downstream area of the bridge. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Yogyakarta has problems in water availability. The demand for water in Yogyakarta Province is gradually increasing with higher consumption for human consumption, industry, and agriculture and livestock production. Also, more inhabitants and farmers are utilizing groundwater for domestic purpose and irrigation due to long drought, respectively. This problem will be increasing as higher population leads to higher water consumption and food production. Therefore, this study aim to understand the current situation and long-term projections of water sources, and demands in 2017-2030 by using water balance concept. After that, the assessment of alternative scenarios to overcome water availability problem was performed using managed aquifer recharge concept and efficient irrigation. The result shows that within the period 2017-2030, water storage is negative in 3 (three) regencies. This means that water deficit had occurred in these regencies where water demand rate is higher than recharge rate of groundwater. Also, it might shows that most of storm water goes to surface runoff and/or most of groundwater abstraction for water demand becomes waste water production. According to the Scenario-1, recharging the aquifer with storm water, converting 45% of surface runoff to groundwater can reduce water deficit in only 2 regencies. Scenario-2 shows that converting 65%, can overcome all 3 regencies from water deficit. Combining aquifer recharge by storm water and effective irrigation can solve water deficit problem in all regencies by only converting 40% of surface runoff to groundwater. The study shows that both approaches of managed aquifer recharge and effective irrigation are applicable in Yogyakarta. In small scale, these applications can be low cost, but at larger scale, can require higher investment cost. Therefore a site-specific knowledge on the project field is very important. Large scale application will need more stakeholders and regulators involvement, and also social awareness and acceptance. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Eco-friendly layout term in this study means the layout produced a minimal bed scouring at the bottom of the structures. In this research, we studied the hydrodynamic flow caused by tsunami wave's propagation on the bearing walls in coastal area. This flow which occur in 2 (two) bearing wall layout variations were analysed using the Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modelling program. The data and condition of the simulation are utilizing the bathymetric and topographic data of coastal area in the south of Yogyakarta, Java Island Indonesia. The simulation result shows that wave propagation reduction of square bearing wall 45° and 0° layout are 52,99% and 59%, respectively. The square bearing wall 0° is not recommended to be applied due to its highest tsunami wave impact force on the wall structure. The square bearing wall of 0° has a higher shear force and lateral force. This forces can caused an unstable structure wall. The wave impact forces on wall structure area and layout is important parameter for changing the scouring parameter influenced. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The purpose of assessing the leaching of nitrate in this study is to understand the transformation and transport process of N-source in topsoil that leads to nitrate contamination of groundwater. In order to calculate N-budget in the soil, the model was utilized to predict the nitrogen leaching. In this res earch, the N-budget model was modified to evaluate influence of precipitation and application pattern of fertilizer and manure compost. The result shows that at the time before the addition of manure compost and fertilizer, about 75% of fertilizer leach from topsoil. Every month, the average remaining nitrate in soil from fertilizer and manure compost are 22% and 50%, respectively. The accumulation of this monthly manure compost nitrate, which stored in soil, should be carefully monitored. It could become the potential source of nitrate leaching to groundwater in the future. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Fertilizer; N-Budget Model; Nitrate Available for Leaching","Budget control; Composting; Farms; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Leaching; Manures; Nitrates; Orchards; Soils; Field research; Groundwater nitrates; Nitrate contamination; Nitrate leaching; Nitrogen leaching; Potential sources; Small scale; Transport process; Fertilizers",,,,,,"Korsaeth, A., Eltun, R., Nitrogen mass balances in conventional, integrated and ecological cropping systems and the relationship between balance calculations and nitrogen runoff in an 8-year field experiment in Norway (2000) Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment, 79 (2-3), pp. 199-214; Sieling, K., Kage, H., N balance as an indicator of N leaching in an oil seed rape - Winter wheat - Winter barley rotation (2006) Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment, 115 (1-4), pp. 261-269; Ruijter, F.J., Boumans, L.J.M., Smit, A.L., Berg, M.V.D., Nitrate in upper groundwater on farms under tillage as affected by fertilizer use, soil type and groundwater table (2007) Nutrient Cycle Agroecosystem, 77 (2), pp. 155-167; Ju, X.T., Kou, C.L., Zhang, F.S., Christie, P., Nitrogen balance and groundwater nitrate contamination: Comparison among three intensive cropping systems on the North China Plain (2006) Environmental Pollution, 143 (1), pp. 117-125; Elmi, A.A., Madramootoo, C., Egeh, M., Liu, A., Hamel, C., Environmental and Agronomic Implications of Water Table and Nitrogen Fertilization Management (2002) Journal of Environmental Quality, 31 (6), pp. 1858-1867; Salo, T., Turtola, E., Nitrogen balance as an indicator of nitrogen leaching in Finland (2006) Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment, 113 (1-4), pp. 98-107; Ota, T., Use of Long-term soil monitoring Database for management of arable land in Japan (2010) Technical Bulletin of Food & Fertilizer Technology Center, , http://www.agnet.org/library/tb/179/; Akinnifesi, F.K., Mhango, J., Sileshi, G., Chilanga, T., Early growth and survival of three miombo woodland indigenous fruit tree species under fertilizer, manure and dry-season irrigation in southern Malawi (2008) Forest Ecology and Management, 255 (3-4), pp. 546-557; Agbede, T.M., Ojeniyi, S.O., Tillage and poultry manure effects on soil fertility and sorghum yield in southwestern Nigeria (2009) Soil and Tillage Research, 104 (1), pp. 74-81; Araújo, A.S.F., Santos, V.B., Monteiro, R.T.R., Responses of soil microbial biomass and activity for practices of organic and conventional farming systems in Piauí state, Brazil (2008) European Journal of Soil Biology, 44 (2), pp. 225-230; Wick, K., Heumesser, C., Schmid, E., Groundwater nitrate contamination: Factors and indicators (2012) Journal of Environmental Management, 111, pp. 178-186; Setyandito, O., Syafalni, S., Wijayanti, Y., Intan, C.D., Satriyo, S., Groundwater Quality Assessment and Recharge Well Design of Cengkareng Area, West Jakarta (2015) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 10, pp. 18337-18348. , ISSN 0973 - 4562; Birkinshaw, S.J., Ewen, J., Nitrogen transformation component for SHETRAN catchment nitrate transport modelling (2000) Journal of Hydrology, 230 (1-2), pp. 1-17; McLay, C.D.A., Dragten, R., Sparling, G., Selvarajah, N., Predicting groundwater nitrate concentrations in a region of mixed agricultural land use: A comparison of three approaches (2001) Environmental Pollution, 115 (2), pp. 191-204; Kleinman, P., Saporito, L.S., McGrath, J.M., Bryant, R.B., Phosphorus and Nitrogen Leaching before and after Tillage and Urea Application (2015) Journal of Environmental Quality, 44 (2), pp. 560-571; Garnier, P., Mary, B., Francois, L., Evaluation of a nitrogen Transport and Transformation Model in Bare Soil (2001) European Journal of Soil Science, 52 (2), pp. 253-268; Onsoy, Y.S., Harter, T., Ginn, T.R., Horwath, W.R., Spatial Variability and Transport of Nitrate in a Deep Alluvial Vadose Zone (2005) Vadose Zone Journal, 4 (1), pp. 41-54; Almasri, M.N., Kaluarachchi, J.J., Modeling nitrate contamination of groundwater in agricultural watersheds (2007) Journal of Hydrology, pp. 211-229; Wijayanti, Y., Nakamura, T., Nishida, K., Haramoto, E., Sakamoto, Y., Groundwater nitrate contamination in small agriculture area: Assessing the source and process using isotopes and ions (2012) Journal of Japan Society of Civil Engineering, 69, pp. I217-I222. , Ser.B1 (Hydraulic Engineering); Wijayanti, Y., Nakamura, T., Nishida, K., Haramoto, E., Sakamoto, Y., Seasonal differences and source estimation of groundwater nitrate contamination (2013) Journal of Water and Environment Technology, 11 (3), pp. 163-174; Yamanashi Prefecture Environment Conservation Agriculture Council Report, , www.maff.go.jp/kanto/seisan/nousan/daizu/other/kyourei_renraku.jtd, JA (Japan Agriculture), 201; www.jma.go.jp, JMA (Japan Meteorological Agency), data of Kofu Sta.

A reliable and complete datasets of urban storm inundation area in Indonesia should become its basis to give clear description of inundation area for formulating the best solution. In this study, Statistics Indonesia data in thirty three provinces were assessed during 2000 until 2012 providing data series of urban flood area, flood frequency and land cover changes. Drainage system condition in big cities should be well understood to ensure its infrastructure condition and performance. If inundation occurred, it can be concluded that there is drainage system problem. Inundation data is also important for drainage system design process in the future. The study result is provided estimation of urban storm inundation area based on calculation of Statistics Indonesia data. Moreover, this study is preceded by analyzing and reviewing the capacity of existing drainage channel, using case study of Mataram, West Nusa Tenggara. Rainfall data was obtained from three rainfall stations surround Mataram City. The storm water quantity was calculated using three different approaches as follows: 1) Rational Method; 2) Summation of existing inundation and surface run off discharge; 3) Discharge calculation from existing channel dimensions. After that, the result of these approaches was compared. The storm water quantity gap was concluded as quantity of inundation. The result shows that 36% of drainage channel in Brenyok Kanan River sub system could not accommodate the storm water runoff in this area, which causing inundation. The redesign of drainage channel using design discharge from Rational Method approach should be performed. Within area with the lowest level topography, a construction of detention or storage pond is essential to prevent inundation in this area. Furthermore, the benefits and drawbacks of the statistics database are discussed. Recommendations include utilizing more refined urban land use typologies that can better represent physical alteration of hydrological pathways. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Drainage Channel Capacity; Inundation; Statistics data Indonesia; Storm Water Quantity","Digital storage; Floods; Land use; Rain; Runoff; Storms; Systems analysis; Channel dimension; Discharge calculation; Drainage channels; Indonesia; Inundation; Land-cover change; Storm water runoff; Stormwaters; Drainage",,,,,,"Dewan, A.M., Yamaguchi, Y., Effect of Land Cover Changes on Flooding: Example from Greater Dhaka of Bangladesh (2008) International Journal of Geornformafrcs, 4; Merz, B., Hall, J., Disse, M., Schumann, A., Fluvial Flood Risk Management in A Changing World (2010) Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, 10 (3), pp. 509-527; Baldassare, B., Matteo, B., Giovanna, G., A Semiprobabilistic Approach for the Design of A Flood Control Reservoir (2010) Advances in Water Resources, 62, pp. 37-46; Ball, T., Hendry, S., Werritty, A., Spray, C.J., (2009) Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009, , (Sweet and Maxwell Statues Annotated); Basnayaka Amila, P., Sarukkalige, R., Werellagama, I., Numerical Modeling of Flood Vulnerability in Urban Catchments for Flood Forecastin (2011) International Journal of Environmental Science and Development, 2, pp. 383-388; Chen, A.S., Hsu, M.H., Chen, T.S., Chang, T.J., An Integrated Inundation Model for Highly Developed Urban Areas (2005) Water Science and Technology, 51, pp. 221-229; Yiping, G., Zhengji, Z., Analytical Probabilistic Flood Routing for Urban Stormwater Management Purposes (2008) Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, 35 (5), p. 487; Joong Gwang, L., Heaney James, P., Estimation of Urban Imperviousness and its Impacts on Storm Water Systems (2003) Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management, 129 (5), pp. 419-426; Akm Saiful, I., Sujit Kumar, B., Anisul, H., Flood Inundation Map of Bangladesh Using Modis Surface Reflectance Data (2009) Journal of Flood Risk Management, 3 (3), pp. 210-222; Zhang, J., Hori, T., Tatano, H., Norio, O., Chao, Z., Takuya, M., GIS and Flood Inundation Model-based Flood Risk Assessment in Urbanized Floodplain.

However, this test is a dry test and does not assess the performance of aggregates when they are wet. In tropical countries, including Indonesia, moisture on aggregates is an important issue as it might introduce problems to the pavement layers during and after the construction process. This research aims to investigate the capability of the LA Abrasion test to assess the moisture susceptibility of aggregates by altering the test procedure. In this research, the LA Abrasion test procedure was modified to test wet aggregates and the results were compared to the original LA Abrasion test. There are three different types of aggregates were tested herein, namely igneous, sedimentary, and coral aggregates. Additionally, the various percentage of clay was also added to cover the aggregates. From the preliminary results, it was found that the LA Abrasion test can be modified to detect the moisture susceptibility of aggregates. Different aggregates have different water absorption levels, and hence, affect the final result (percentage of material loss). Adding clay to the aggregates also affected the results. © 2017 Author(s).",,,,,,,,"Nataadmadja, A.D., Setyandito, O., Basrian, F.M., Kurniawardhani, M.G., The study of the usage of coral and limestone aggregates as asphaltic layer on coastal structures (2017) MATEC Web of Conferences; Smith, M.R., Collis, L., Aggregates: Sand, gravel and crushed rock aggregates for construction purposes (2001) The Geological Society; Hosking, J.R., (1970) Synthetic Aggregates of High Resistance to Polishing Part 1 - Gritty Aggregates; Hartley, A., (1974) J.

Any structures constructed along the coastline, such as pavement layer on sea dike, must be able to resist the hydrodynamic forces from the waves, such as the overtopping wave. It is necessary to find an aggregate to be used as surfacing layer for sea dike and/or flexible pavement that can withstand these (compressive) forces. This research analyses the feasibility of two natural aggregates, namely the coral and limestone aggregates, to be used as an ingredient for asphalt surface layer on coastal structures. Asphalt mix samples were prepared by using these two aggregates with various percentage of asphalt. The Marshall stability, flow, and the compressive force (Flab) of the prepared samples were tested in the laboratory. The stability and the flow of asphalt samples were tested to verify that the asphalt mix satisfies the requirements specified by Standar Nasional Indonesia 06-2489-1991. Moreover, this research also calculates the overtopping waves by varying the height and the period of the waves. The results were then converted as a compressive force (Fwave) and compared to the Flab to see whether the prepared samples could resist the calculated Fwave. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",,"Asphalt; Coastal engineering; Hydraulic structures; Levees; Limestone; Pavements; Underwater foundations; Asphalt surface layer; Coastal structures; Compressive forces; Flexible pavements; Hydrodynamic forces; Limestone aggregates; Marshall stability; Overtopping waves; Aggregates",,,,,,"Jassim, I., Tan, S., Vermeer, P.A., Hicks, M.A., (2012) Conference of the Association for Computational Mechanics in Engineering ACME; Pilarczyk, K.W., (1998) Dikes and Revetments: Design, Maintenance and Safety Assessment; Nandlal, S., (1985) Lightweight Semi-flexible Dike; Van Der Meer, J., Pilarczyk, K.W., (1998) Seawalls, Dikes and Revetments; (1977) Asphalt Revetments of Dyke Slopes, , Committee on The Compaction of Asphalt Revetments of Dyke Slopes; Devnita, R., (2009) Jurnal Geologi Indonesia, 4 (1), pp. 19-29; Yamin, A., (2011) Jurnal Jalan - Jembatan, 28, p. 3; Ogundipe, O.M., (2016) Transportation Research Procedia, 14, pp. 685-693; Manglorkar, D., Kandhal, P.S.K., Parker, F., (1991) Evaluation of Limestone Coarse Aggregate in Asphalt Concrete Wearing Courses 1991, , Auburn University Highway Research Center Alabama, United States of America; Chairuddin, F., Tjaronge, M.W., Ramli, M., Patanduk, J., (2016) IACSIT International Journal of Engineering and Technology, 8, p. 3; Bowers, N.A., (1944) Engineering News Record, pp. 80-85. , July; (1993) A Guide to the Structural Design of Bitumen-Surfaced Roads in Tropical and Sub-Tropical Countries, , Overseas Centre, Transportation and Road Research Laboratory; Palmer, J., (2013) Use of Coral As An Engineered Construction Aggregate in Pacific Runways; Schlüttrumpf, H., Van Der Meer, J., Kortenhaus, A., Bruce, T., Franco, L., Kim, Y.C., (2010) Handbook of Coastal and Ocean Engineering; Van Der Meer, J.W., Janssen, J.P.F.M., Kobayashi, N., Demirbilek, Z., (1995) Wave Forces on Inclined and Vertical Wall Structures; Franco, L., Gerloni, M.D., Van Der Meer, J.W., (1994) Coastal Engineering, pp. 1030-1045; Van Gent, M.R.A., (2002) 28th Conference on Coastal Engineering; Steendam, G.J., Van Der Meer, J.W., Hardeman, B., Van Hoven, A., (2012) International Conference on Coastal Engineering ICCE; Wati, W., (2015) Pengaruh Penambahan Bahan Alami Lateks (Getah Karet) Terhadap Karakteristik Campuran Hot Rolled Sheet Wearing Course (HRSWC); Bruce, T., Van Der Meer, J.W., Pullen, T., Allsop, W., (2009) Wave Overtopping at Vertical and Steep Structure; (2007) Calculation Tool, , http://www.overtopping-manual.com/aboutthis-site.html, HR Wallingford Ltd; Pullen, T., Allsop, N.W.H., Bruce, T., Kortenhaus, A., Schlüttrumpf, H., Van Der Meer, J.W., (2007) EurOtop Wave Overtopping of Sea Defences and Related Structures: Assessment Manual; (2010) Dokumen Pelelangan Nasional - Penyediaan Pekerjaan Konstruksi (Pemborongan) Untuk Kontrak Harga Satuan, , Direktorat Jenderal Bina Marga","Dwidarma Nataadmadja, A.; Civil Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: anataadmadja@binus.edu","Iskandar I.Agustina T.E.Komariah L.N.Ismadji S.Yani I.Hasyim S.","","EDP Sciences","1st Sriwijaya International Conference on Engineering, Science and Technology, SICEST 2016","9 November 2016 through 10 November 2016",,126687,2261236X,,,,"English","MATEC Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015903236

Overflow of Ciliwung River is one of rivers that causing floods in Jakarta. Katulampa Post/Weir is an early warning system of flooding occurrence in Ciliwung River before entering the city. The discharge at Katulampa weir measured by using manual or conventional system. This paper presented study result of frequency analysis of maximum dischargeat Katulampa Weir. The outcome will be utilized as the basis in the prediction of design-flood discharge for flood management plan. Flood often occurs in Ciliwung River which detected at Katulampa Weir. This study is preceded by analyzing the discharge and precipitation data using approach hydrology and statistics. Based on the calculated discharge by using rational method, correlation between the discharge at Katulampa Weir and upstream rainfall of Ciliwung River showed linear trendline. The study showed that Gumbel distribution is the best method in calculating design-flood discharge. Based on ratios among Katulampa Weir and Panus Bridge post Depok, Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) on Katulampa Weir has large error percentage compare to Panus bridge post Depok. Hence, conventional water level recording system in the Katulampa Weir is not effective to minimize the error in data recording. Design-flood discharge of 1078,62 m3/s; 1177,61 m3/s; and 1276,61 m3/s was obtained using maximum discharge analysis with 25, 50 and 100 years return periods and 10% risk level.

Land use change from open space area into settlements and business area has increased surface runoff that causing flooding. Also, activities in these areas had caused groundwater pollution and groundwater level declined. Groundwater recharge well is one of many methods to increase groundwater level by utilizing storm water infiltration. Thus, storm water that causing inundation could be converted to recharge the groundwater. This research was performed quality and quantity analysis to study existing groundwater condition. The hydrochemistry of groundwater in all sampling locations shows high NH4 ranging from 2.3 mg/L to 19.02 mg/L indicate groundwater contamination suspected originated from domestic/non domestic waste or septic tank leakage. Also, one of five sampling locations shows Na and EC value which exceeds the permissible limit that might due to salt intrusion. Regarding groundwaterlevel for Cengkareng area, the result shows that there is a significant groundwater level decline at ’deeper confined aquifer (>140)’ wells from 2005 to 2013. The groundwater level trend line shows that the groundwater level will continue to decrease in the future. There is no groundwater decline at ‘above confined aquifer (40-140 m)’ wells, but groundwater level is very low at around -58 m AMSL. This could be the result of intensive groundwater withdrawal that has been occurring years ago until now. Hence, groundwater recharge in this area is critical, in order to restore groundwater storage. Therefore, the artificial recharge of storm water, will work on reducing the groundwater pollutant and increasing the water level. Finally, the design of infiltration wells was completed using Sunjoto Formula and rainfall data of Cengkareng, with soil permeability of 14x10-6 m/s. © Research India Publications.","Cengkareng; Groundwater level; Hydrochemical characteristics; Recharge well",,,,,,,"Djaja, R., Rais, J., Zabidin, H., Wedyanto, K., (2004) Land Subsidence of Jakarta Metropolitan Area, , https://www.fig.net/pub/jakarta/papers/ts_06/ts_06_4_djaja_etal.pdf, Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia.

By undertanding the stability of armour layer on the breakwater due to wave attack, it could minimize the breakwater damage and maximize the armour layer performance as a breakwater protector. The armour stability on composite breakwater has been investigated by 2-D physical model experiments using regular waves, combining with theoretical approach and field data application of South Java coastline, Indonesia. Tetrapods are used as armour layer for the breakwater. The breakwater model was placed inside a wave flume. The result shows that the level of damage was affected by wave characteristics of wave steepness. The steeper the wave steepness, the armour layer profile will change. It is shown by the percentage of the number of displacement and movement number of armour unit from its initial position, or armour layer damage under design wave. The results conclude that the results of physical models study can be used as a reference for the design of armour layer on breakwater. © IDOSI Publications, 2014.","2-D physical model; Armour layer; Wave height; Wave period",,,,,,,"Yasuhara, K., Komine, H., Yokoki, H., Suzuki, T., Mimura, N., Tamura, M., Chen, G., Effects of climate change on coastal disasters: New methodologies and recent results (2011) Sustainability Science, 6 (2), pp. 219-232; IPCC., ""Climate change, The physical science basis (2007) Contribution of Working Group i to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Solomon"", S., Qin, D., Manning, M., Chen, Z., Marquis, M., Averyt, K.

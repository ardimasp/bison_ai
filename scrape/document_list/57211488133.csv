The cat owners need to answer questionnaire to detect what disease is suffering by their cat. The result of the disease is also accompanied by the first treatment that cat owners can do to treat their cats. In addition, this application also has a feature that provides information, tips and tricks in cat care. The research methods used to analyze the development of this application are literature study through books, journals and e-books. Furthermore, observation, distribution of questionnaires for data collection and interviews to ensure data accuracy. We also make comparisons with applications that have similar concepts and features similar to our application. The research method used for the development of this application is waterfall that has five stages, requirements definition, system and software design, implementation and unit testing, integration and system testing and operation and maintenance. The results obtained from this writing show that the owner of the cat can feel the ease in detecting and knowing the disease from their cats who are sick, also getting knowledge on how to take care of cats in a good way. © 2019 ASTES Publishers.

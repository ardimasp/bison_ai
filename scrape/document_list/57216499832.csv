Several methods have been used to detect vulnerabilities in web applications such as black-box testing, dynamic analysis, and static analysis. In this article, we propose a framework for detecting web application vulnerabilities by combining all three methods. The strengths of one method are used to overcome the weaknesses of another method. This framework is believed to provide better results than if each method was used separately. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"This research was supported by Universitas Stikubank Semarang.

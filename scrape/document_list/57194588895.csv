Dark tourism, as the niche of tourism offers an economic value for tourists' consumption that forged between reality and imagination. However, few studies were found to understand the realm of development of dark tourism varieties and attractions, which associated with death and suffering from lower political and ideology to the highest range while consuming it. Therefore, alongside the analytical thinking towards the product's typology and variety, the examination of both SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunity, Threats) model and TOWS (Threat-Opportunity & Weakness-Strength) matrix, synchronize the sites' elaboration resources and capabilities in which the dark tourism's place and space operate. Both of the qualitative case studies of Fatahillah Dungeon and Taman Prasasti museum provide the research practice that emerges from the visitors' voices. The findings deliver undiscovered value for the product development initiative, where at the same time bids the model for the dark tourism's consumption in term of the value creation and experience that giving the sites' meaning in recognizing how 'dark' the product is and stand out from the mass. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Museums; Tourism; Analytical thinking; Economic values; Qualitative case studies; Resources and capabilities; Value creation; Leisure industry",,,,,,"(2017) Travel & Tourism: Economic Impact 2017 - World, , WTTC; (2016) Global Travel & Tourism Economic Impact Update August 2016, , WTTC; Komsary, K.C., Commemorative Tourism: Menuju Sebuah Tipologi Daya Tarik Wisata Yang Berhubungan Dengan Kematian dan Bencana (2016) Jurnal Hospitality Dan Pariwisata, 2; Hartmann, R., Dark tourism, thanatourism, and dissonance in heritage tourism management: New directions in contemporary tourism research (2014) Journal of Heritage Tourism, 9 (2), pp. 166-182; Sharpley, R., Stone, P.R., (2009) The Darker Side of Travel: The Theory and Practice of Dark Tourism, 41; Tarlow, P.E., Novelli, M., (2007) Niche Tourism: Contemporary Issues, Trends and Cases, p. 47; (2018) Auswitch-Birkenau Attendance, , http://auschwitz.org/en/visiting/attendance/, [cited 2018 23 April 2018]; Blair, J., (2002) The New York Times; (2018) Tripadvisor.

This study considers how to determine acceptable levels of impact that occurs in the Pangandaran area. This method involves stakeholders in determining the values, issues, and concerns the acceptable levels of impact for this region.

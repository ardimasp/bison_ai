Methods used are feature selection of HRV for classification utilizing Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear and with Radial Based Function (RBF) kernel, K Nearest Neigbors (KNN) and RBF Neural Network (RBF NN). SVM with RBF kernel gives better accuracy for almost every feature selected with margin above 20% than SVM linear, while both method also give accuracy result better than with KNN or RBF NN. We conclude that based on this comparison, SVM with RBF kernel is the best method for this classification. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

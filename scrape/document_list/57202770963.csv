The success and failure of online sales depends on how satisfied and loyal the customer is to the service of the product or business which can certainly influence and increase competition between the online sales industry. Based on that background we want to measure how much influence the quality of services provided by the Online Marketplace to customers has an impact on customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. The measurement method used is to use E-Service Quality, to determine customer satisfaction (Customer Satisfaction) and determine the level of customer loyalty (Customer Loyalty). This research uses a quantitative approach and uses random sampling techniques. Data collection using a questionnaire with data samples totaling 102 respondents. The results of this study indicate that there is a significant relationship between E-Service Quality, Customer Satisfaction and Customer Loyalty to customers that increase customer online shopping transactions so that companies are able to compete with other companies. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a pattern of relations between rice availability and rice consumption so that a balance occurs in the management of rice availability. The method used is the System Dynamics model, where this method is able to formulate a complex system by utilizing historically existing data to form a model, therefore this approach is expected to form a performance model of balance between rice availability and consumption which can then be simulated to predict needs in the future so that it can be used for faster and more accurate decision making. © BEIESP.","Modelsimulation; Rice availability; System dynamics",,,,,,"Junzeng, X., Bai, W., Li, Y., Wang, H., Wei, Z., Modeling rice development and field water balance using AquaCrop model under drying-wetting cycle condition in eastern China (2019) Agricultural Water Management, 213, pp. 289-297; Muhammadi, E.A., Soesilo, B., (2001) Analisa Sistem Dinamis ‘Lingkungan Hidup, , Sosial.

This process focuses on understanding the needs of the company's business processes to improve employee performance. The purpose of the study was to define business process management systems implementation model that can be used to measure employee performance improvement. The research methodology used the literature study, observations, questionnaires, and analysis of data using factor analysis. Results obtained from the research is a new factor analysis and indicators that can be used as a basis business process management systems implementation model for employee performance measurement model. Thus it can be concluded that in this study, the example of the company used in the study has an inadequate business process management system so that the results of this study produce a business process management implementation model that can be used as a benchmark in improving employee performance in a better direction. © 2018 IEEE.","business process panagement system; factor analysis; key performance indikator","Benchmarking; Enterprise resource management; Factor analysis; Information management; Multivariant analysis; Personnel rating; Supply chain management; Surveys; Business Process; Business process management; Business process management systems; Employee performance; Implementation models; key performance indikator; Literature studies; Research methodologies; Administrative data processing",,,,,"Balaban, N., Belic, K., Marko, G., Business process performance management : Theoretical and methodological approach and implementation (2011) Management Information System, 6, pp. 003-009; Baltzan, P., (2012) Business Driven Information System (3rd Ed.).

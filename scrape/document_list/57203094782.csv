The research methodology is that would be used is literature, collect data sample and data analysis. Method collected data sample with observation and questionnaire. Method data analysis using factor analysis. Method the results obtained from this study is the analysis of new factors and indicators that can be used as a basis for determining that the effect of a successful ERP implementation. Data obtained from questionnaires to 120 respondents in Ministry of Finance unit. Data can be processed from the 92 questionnaire respondents. Data were analyzed using reliability and factor analysis method after that proceed by using regression analysis. Results obtained in the form of a new model that can be used by the Finance Ministry is to evaluate the success of ERP Systems implementation. By using the new model of successful ERP System Implementation evaluate this, we can determine the minimum and maximum values that affect the successful of ERP system implementation to make a reference to improvement and development process of the system for the better system ahead. © 2018 IEEE.","enterprise resources planning; evaluation; factor analysis; regression analysis; successful system implementation","Data handling; Factor analysis; Finance; Information analysis; Information management; Multivariant analysis; Regression analysis; Reliability analysis; Surveys; Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems; Enterprise resources planning; Erp system implementations; ERP systems implementations; evaluation; Factor analysis method; Research methodologies; System implementation; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,"Chou, D.C., Tripuramallu, H.B., Chou, A.Y., BI and ERP integration (2005) Information Management & Computer Security, 13 (5), pp. 340-349; Jayawickrama, U., Yapa, S., Factors affecting ERP Implementations: Client and consultant perspectives.IBIMA Publishing (2013) Journal of Enterprise Resource Planning Studies, , http://www.ibimapublishing.com/journals/JERPS/jerps.html.2013, 2013), Article ID 227873 13; Tambovcevs, A., Tambovceva, T., (2013) ERP system implementation: Benefits and economic effectiveness.

This machine log contains a variety of information about the printed product produced. By analyzing the login, it is expected to find patterns that can be used to find out customer needs. Case-based Reasoning is a knowledge transformation technique used in the context of a new algorithm. The way to find out the case-based reason is to use data mining techniques. One technique is the C4.5 method, called the tree data mining method which is often used in classifying and making rules based on transactional data or facts. The purpose of this study is to determine the rules or segmentation of customers. So that in the future the rules generated from this context can be used in system development. © 2018 IEEE.","C4.5; Consumen Segmentation; Data mining Case base Reasoning","Data mining; Intelligent systems; Trees (mathematics); C4.5; Case-base reasonings; Case-based reasoning approaches; Knowledge transformation; Printed products; Printing machines; System development; Transactional data; Case based reasoning",,,,,"Hendriani, L., (2007) Inovasi Program Promosi Untuk Sales, , Jakarta: AcNielsen; Padmanaban, B., Segmenting customer transactions using a pattern-based clustering approach Int.

As an insurance company, an agency of Commonwealth life agency will be aware of the knowledge for their company. Therefore the agency always pays attention to training and development of science from every agent. But unfortunately there are still some obstacles related to knowledge, such as the absence of good and integrated knowledge settings. That is almost personal knowledge and can't be shared. To maximize the use of knowledge, an Agency of Commonwealth life agency managerial initiative begins to build Knowledge Management. Sales cycle are used as an approach to build the knowledge center, to support the knowledge sharing culture. It is expected that with this knowledge management, existing knowledge in that Agency of Commonwealth life agency can become more organized, and can be utilized more leverage. In the end can help the development of the company.

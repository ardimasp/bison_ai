In this research, sales promotion is the monetary promotion. By using a good sales promotion, the company will know the customer perception of the brand. Previous studies have stated that monetary promotion is a key element in a successful marketing strategy. The management of hypermarkets needs to understand the dynamic of monetary promotion and conceive new ways of organising and executing hypermarket activities that add values to customers. A total of 100 shoppers at a selected hypermarket was used as samples. This study adopted a customer-based approach to address consumer aspects affecting brand awareness, perceived quality, brand association, and brand loyalty. The unit of analysis were Indonesian consumers who are familiar with Antis brand and actively shop at Carrefour’s Puri Hypermarket Jakarta, Indonesia. Data was analysed using Structural Equation Modelling-Partial Least Square (PLS-SEM) method. The results showed intensity of distribution channels had a positive significant influence on perceived quality, brand awareness, brand association, and brand loyalty.

Syahdan, Jakarta, 11530, Indonesia; Ismail, I., School of Management, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Malaysia; Wahid, N.A., Graduate School of Business, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Malaysia","The aim of this conceptual paper is to investigate the social media adoption by Indonesian small and medium enterprises (SME) managers. The proliferation of social media has changed the way enterprises market their products or services. A review of the literature shows there is lack of research investigating the adoption that systematically uses one theoretical model; and later putting the model in the context of the Small and Medium Enterprises in Indonesia. Most research on Social Media adoption by Small and Medium Enterprises used either technological acceptance models, or examined the characteristics of the enterprise. Both UTAUT (The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) and UTAUT2 have shown inconsistent results. This paper proposes a new model by decomposing the social influence with normative, coercive and mimetic pressures. In the proposed model, subjective norm is decomposed into normative pressure of employees, coercive pressure of customers and mimetic pressure of competitors. The framework contributes to the knowledge in the field of consumer behavior and technology acceptance research, by decomposing the construct of social influence. Secondly, and it tested the manager’s characteristics of habit, age, gender and also the experience. It not only merely tested as moderators but also as a predictor of behavioral intention. The results of this study are also expected to benefit entrepreneurs and the government of the Republic of Indonesia in terms of assisting entrepreneurs to be more effective. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

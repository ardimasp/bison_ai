Organizations must define resources and capabilities to help choose and implement the right strategies. By fostering learning can make a difference in navigating the unknown of VUCA. Learning center becomes one of the important functions in improving the ability of employees to help organization gain the competitive advantage. Corporate Universities are increasingly emerging to answer this challenging situation, but whether the established corporate university can provide value for the organization?. This research conducted a case study on Binus Corporate Learning & Development (BCL&D) as a corporate university since 2013. It is found that corporate universities are important to conduct this survey, in order to know the gaps that exist between the programs offered and what is assessed by employees, and how corporate university communicate the value given. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

The number of corporate universities has substantially increased since the 90’s, and some researchers have noted that corporate universities can be a related to production of innovation. Knowledge management somehow plays an important role in managing new and existing knowledge gained from a learning activity. Bina Nusantara (BINUS) a leading organization in education business, is currently known as the only entity that has implemented a corporate university in Indonesia. This research will analyze the role of the corporate university program in building innovation capability through knowledge management; however, only limited related research has conducted empirically. Using the SEM PLS analysis method, research is conducted through the “Best Employee of BINUS” program which considers a “Best Employee” an organization’s representative who guarantees the continuity of the a corporate university program, and its organizational capability via knowledge management. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","A corporate university; Innovation capability; Knowledge management",,,,,,"University for the research grant that funded this study and for my (LKA’s) Supervisors: Dr. Dyah Budiastuti and Dr. Mohammad Hamsal, and also Prof. Dr. Ir.

People can study whenever and wherever based on their availability and interest. The growth of e-learning in higher education has developed rapidly to accommodate the issue. This paper aimed to find out the key success factors of e-learning in higher education. Systematic Literature Review was conducted to reach the finding. 54 journal articles were examined to gain the result. The examined journal articles were published between 2006 up to 2016. The result showed that there were 17 key critical success factors of e-learning in higher education. The most critical factor was the IT infrastructure or the learning management system (LMS) followed by e-learning tools and e-learning models. The result also revealed that there was a paradigm shifting in learning process from traditional way. It was suggested the future focus of this research area to emphasize the implementation of LMS in e-learning so that e-learning in higher education can be implemented well. © 2017 IEEE.","CSFs; e-learning; higher education; SLR","Enterprise resource planning; Information management; Critical success factor; CSFs; E-learning models; Higher education; IT infrastructures; Key success factors; Learning management system; Systematic literature review; E-learning",,,,,,"Barak, M., Watted, A., Haick, H., Computers & Education Motivation to learn in massive open online courses: Examining aspects of language and social engagement (2016) Computers & Education, 94, pp. 49-60. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2015.11.010; Arkoful, V., Abaidoo, N., (2014) The Role of E-learning, the Advantages and Disadvantages of Its Adoption in Higher Education, 2 (12), pp. 397-410; Anderson-Meger, J., (2011) Critical Thinking and E-Learning in Social Work Education, 1 (2), pp. 17-27; Ahmad, Z., Alabaddi, A., Rahahleh, A.H., Al-Omoush, M.M., (2016) Blended E-Learning Constraints from the Viewpoint of Faculty Members, 11 (7), pp. 180-190. , http://doi.org/10.5539/ijbm.v11n7p180; Alazmi, M., Zairi, M., (2017) Total Quality Management & Business Excellence, 3363. , http://doi.org/10.1080/1478336032000051386, January; Alhomod, S., Alsadhan, A.O., Shafi, M.M., (2014) The 3C' S Model: A Framework for Development of E-Learning Courses, 7 (1), pp. 87-93. , http://doi.org/10.5539/cis.v7n1p87; Alowayr, A., Badii, A., (2014) Review of M Onitoring Tools for E-learning Platforms, 6 (3), pp. 79-86. , http://doi.org/10.5121/ijcsit.2014.6306; Alsabawya, A.Y., Cater-Steel, A., Soar, J., IT infrastructure services as a requirement for e-learning system success (2013) Computers & Education, , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.035; Al-Samarraie, H., Teo, T., Abbas, M., Computers & Education Can structured representation enhance students' thinking skills for better understanding of E-learning content?

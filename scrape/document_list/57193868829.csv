Detection of retinopathy can be by analyzing the retinal image, using a deep learning approach, but the problem that is often faced is unbalanced data. In this study, a convolutional neural network architec- ture is proposed for the classification of retinopathy using the MESSIDOR database that has been labeled, by duplicating and augmentation of sample images in classes with low numbers of samples using a data generator to overcome the problem of unbalanced data. The experimental results show that the validation and testing accuracy performance on the model with two output classes are 100%, and 87.50%, while on the model with four output classes are 99.38%, and 76.47%.

Software reliability measurements are performed at every stage of software development process to evaluate whether the software reliability requirements has been fulfilled. In this paper proposed the new methods to measuring the software reliability based on categorize faults. We use J.D Musa-III failure datasets are divided into 5 modules to measure software reliability using our method. Base on J.D Musa-III datasets we got the value of reliability is 0.7416 or 74%. The software reliability can be measured using this method and the future work is to categorize the failure of the software based on the source of its failure. © 2017 IEEE.","fault; matrix; measured; software reliability","Computer software selection and evaluation; Faulting; Matrix algebra; Software design; Failure intensity; Free software; measured; Operating periods; Software development process; Software Quality; Software reliability measurements; Time-periods; Software reliability",,,,,"Nanda, S.S., Soewito, B., Modeling software effort estimation using hybrid pso-ANFIS (2016) 2016 International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications (ISITIA, pp. 219-224. , Lombok; Ryan, R., Gaol, F.L., Service oriented architecture governance implementation in a software development project as an enterprise solutions (2013) Journal of Computer Science, 9 (12), p. 1638; Börcsök, J., (2004) Electronic Safety Systems, Hardware Concepts, Models, and Calculation, , Heidelberg, Germany; Pai, Ganesh, J., (2013) A Survey of Software Reliability Models., , arXiv preprint 1304.4539; Iskandar, K., Gaol, F.L., Soewito, B., Hendric Spits Warnars, H.L., Software size measurement of knowledge management portal with use case point The International Conference on Computer, Control, Informatics, and Its Applications (IC3INA 2016, , 3-5 Oct 2016, Tangerang, Indonesia; Musa, J.D., More reliable software faster and cheaper (2004) Software Reliability Engineering ,United States of America; Schneidewind, N.F., Minimizing risk in applying metrics on multiple projects (1992) Proc.

Most heart attacks occur in patients caused by high blood pressure symptoms of undiagnosed. Hypertensive retinopathy Symptoms such as arteriolar narrowing, retinal haemorrhage and cotton wool spots. Based on this reasons, the early diagnosis of the symptoms of hypertensive retinopathy is very urgent to aim the prevention and treatment more accurate. This research aims to develop a system for early detection of hypertension retinopathy stage. The proposed method is to determine the combined features artery and vein diameter ratio (AVR) as well as changes position with Optic Disk (OD) in retinal images to review the classification of hypertensive retinopathy using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Boltzmann Machines approach. We choose this approach of because based on previous research DNN models were more accurate in the image pattern recognition, whereas Boltzmann machines selected because It requires speedy iteration in the process of learning neural network.

HR signs occur because of narrowing of the arteries in the retina, bleeding in the retina of the eye and cotton wool spots. The diagnosis is conventionally performed by an ophthalmologist by performing fundus image analysis to determine the phases of HR disease symptoms. This paper proposes an early detection system of hypertensive retinopathy disease. We propose to use Fundus image as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) input to determine whether there are any HR symptoms or not. The proposed system is tested by DRIVE image dataset and base on experiment, the accuracy of proposed method is 98.6%, where the more the number of iterations the higher the accuracy level of the training. © 2017 The Authors.

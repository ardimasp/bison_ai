In everyday life, there is a lot of need to predict something. For example, when you want to determine which items someone wants to buy or estimate the results of football matches or predict the rating of a movie. It's better if we can sell something that is in accordance with the wishes of the customer. Therefore, algorithm predictions are needed that can produce predictions accurately and precisely. In this paper, algorithm predictions are presented with prior data concepts, where data will be divided into 2 parts, training and testing dataset. There are 5 stages in the Priori Prediction (PP) algorithm starting from the data input process, checking the similarity of data, calculating using the difference function, calculating the predictive score, then evaluating using MAE. PP algorithm is also compared with other recommender system algorithms, which are collaborative filtering, cosine similarity, and content-based filtering in experiments and evaluations. The test results show that the proposed algorithm has satisfactory performance compared to other recommender system. © 2019 IEEE.","football score prediction; item rating; prediction algorithm; recommender system","Collaborative filtering; Forecasting; Information management; Sports; Statistical tests; Content based filtering; Cosine similarity; Data input; Difference functions; Prediction algorithms; Priori predictions; Training and testing; Recommender systems",,,,,"Mirshahvalad, R., Zanjani, N.A., Diabetes prediction using ensemble perceptron algorithm (2017) 2017 9th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks, pp. 190-194; Oana, L., Spataru, A., Use of genetic algorithms in numerical weather prediction (2016) 18th International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing, pp. 456-461; Sespajayadi, A., Indrabayu, Nurtanio, I., Technical data analysis for movement prediction of euro to usd using genetic algorithm-neural network (2015) 2015 International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications, pp. 23-26; Shibu Kumar, K.B., Susheela Devi, V., Rajeev, K.K., Bhatia, A., Probabilistic algorithms for election result prediction (2014) 2014 International Conference on Soft Computing & Machine Intelligence, pp. 79-82; Haojun, Q., Tao, Z., Jichang, G., Task scheduling prediction algorithms for dynamic hardware/software partitioning (2012) 2012 Fifth International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms and Programming, pp. 80-85; Zhou, D., Wu, X., Zhao, W., Lawless, S., Liu, J., Query expansion with enriched user profiles for personalized search utilizing folksonomy data (2017) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 29 (7), pp. 1536-1548; Du, Q., Xie, H., Cai, Y., Leung, H., Li, Q., Min, H., Wang, F.L., Folksonomy-based personalized search by hybrid user profiles on multiple levels (2016) Neurocomputing, 2014, pp. 142-152. , Apr; Xue, D., Wang, Y., Applying cosine similarity to discount evidence (2017) 2017 10th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design (ISCID), 1, pp. 516-519; Sun, B., Dong, L., Dynamic model adaptive to user interest drift based on cluster and nearest neighbors (2017) IEEE Access, 5, pp. 1682-1691; Yang, J., Leskovec, J., Defining and evaluating network communities based on ground-truth (2012) 12th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining; Leskovec, J., Sosic, R., Snap: A general-purpose network analysis and graph-mining library (2016) ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), 8 (1), pp. 1-20; Aarhof, M., (2018) Football Data, , https://datahub.io/collections/football.[Accessed:21-Nov-2018]; Jain, S., Grover, A., Singh Thakur, P., Kumar Choudhary, S., Trends, problems and solutions of recommender system (2015) International Conference on Computing on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA2015)",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","4th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2019","19 August 2019 through 20 August 2019",,152147,,9781728133331,,,"English","Proc.

With frequent itemset dataset, association rules will be obtained. The main problems that exist in association rule mining is the use of large computer main memory at the time of the formation of Frequent Itemset. EFP algorithms (Expand FP-Growth) overcome this problem by utilizing secondary storage as a processing area to store it in the table object in the database. Data management processes in a database done by using a DBMS (Database Management System). The database used is Oracle database which has its integrated DBMS. Table object is a representation of the set on set theory in mathematics. One of set theory type is an intersection, the result of intersection of a set will be smaller than originally set (dimensionality reduction). IST-EFP algorithm apply the concept of intersection of set theory in EFP algorithm that can reduce 2.33% more items while maintaining association rules obtained. © 2015 IEEE.","association rule mining; EFP algorithm; item reductions; Oracle DBMS; set theory","Algorithms; Association rules; Digital storage; Information management; Set theory; Dimensionality reduction; FP growths; Frequent itemset; Large computers; Main memory; Management process; Oracle database; Secondary storage; Database systems",,,,,"Nath, B., Bhattacharyya, D.K., Ghosh, A., Dimensionality reduction for association rule mining (2011) International Journal of Intelligent Information Processing, 2 (1); Kumbhare, T.A., Chobe, S.V., An overview of association rule mining algorithms (2014) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technologies, 5 (1), pp. 927-930; Sethi, A., Mahajan, P., Association rule mining: A review (2012) The International Journal of Computer Science & Applications, 1 (9), pp. 72-83; Borgelt, C., An implementation of the FP-growth algorithm (2005) OSDB'05, , Chicago, Illinois, USA; Shang, X., Sattler, K.-U., Geist, I., SQL based frequent pattern mining with FP-growth (2005) Applications of Declarative Programming and Knowledge Management Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3392, pp. 32-46; Lipschutz, S., Lipson, M., (2007) Discrete Mathematics, , Third Edition Mc Graw Hill; Vu, L., Alaghband, G., (2012) Mining Frequent Patterns Based on Data Characteristics; Suman, M., Anuradha, T., Gowtham, K., Ramakrishna, A., A frequent pattern mining algorithm based on FP-tree structure and apriori algorithm (2011) Research Journal of Computer Systems Engineering, 2 (5), pp. 275-277; Garg, D., Sharma, H., Comparative analysis of various approaches used in frequent pattern mining (2011) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, pp. 141-147",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd International Conference on Information and Communication Technology, ICoICT 2015","27 May 2015 through 29 May 2015",,117955,,9781479977529,,,"English","Int.

In this institution, each component has responsibility to manage their own finance and budgeting. Based on this case, they need a solution to summarize the amount and absorption of the budget in every component. This paper proposes a solution to design a data warehouse model to process and analyse the down payment administration data. The nine steps design methodology for developing data warehouse is implemented in this work. This paper aims to bring some benefit for The Constitutional Court, especially in form of information about down payment absorption for every component each year. The result is presented in form of pdf report and informative dashboard using data warehouse tools. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Budget control; Design Methodology; Indonesia; Data warehouses",,,,,"Abba Suganda, G., Candrauji Wira, P., Data Warehouse Development for Customer WIFI Access Service at a Telecommunication Company (2017) International Journal on Communications Antenna and Propagation, 7 (2), pp. 114-124; Ove, A., Christian, T., Kristian, T., Simple ETL: ETL Processing by Simple Specifications (2018) CEUR; Ralph, K., Margy, R., (2002) The Data Warehouse Toolkit Second Edition the Complete Guide to Dimensional Modelling, , (Toronto: Robert Ipsen); Lohiya Akshay, S., Optimize ETL for Banking DDS: Data Refinement Using ETL Process for Banking Detail Data Store(DDS) (2017) Imperial Journal of Interdisciplinary Research (IJIR), 3, p. 1839; Sergio, L., Panos, V., Juan, T., (2004) Data Mapping Diagrams for Data Warehouse Design with UML, pp. 191-204. , (Springer); Bhadresh, P., Sanjay, S., Query Optimizer for the ETL Process in Data Warehouses (2015) IJSRSET, pp. 329-333; Gajare Harikishan, P., Rangdale, S.P., ETL Data conversion: Extraction, transformation and loading Data conversion (2017) International Journal of Engineering and Computer Science, pp. 22545-22550; Nayem, R., A Simulation Model for Application Development in Data Warehouses (2018) International Journal of Operations Research and Information Systems, 9 (1), pp. 66-80; Nayem, R., Enterprise Data Warehouse Governance Best Practices (2016) International Journal of Knowledge-Based Organizations, 6 (2), pp. 21-37; Franck, R., Jiefu, S., Olivier, T., OLAP Analysis Operators for Multi-State Data Warehouses (2016) International Journal of Data Warehousing and Mining, 12 (4), pp. 20-53; Ramzan, T., A Multi-Agent Framework for Data Extraction, Transformation and Loading in Data Warehouse (2016) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 7 (11), pp. 351-354; Panos, V., Alkis, S., Spiros, S., Conceptual Modelling for ETL Processes (2002) Dolap, 14, p. 17",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","2nd Nommensen International Conference on Technology and Engineering, NICTE 2018","19 July 2018 through 20 July 2018",,140093,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

For this reason the method used is a quantitative research method which is carried out by distributing questionnaires to the respondents and then completing it by using path analysis. The results showed that Pancasila Education, especially the First Principle has no significant influence. It can be seen on the amounted 34,30%, while the effect of Religion Education on the Faithfulness Formation of the students is significant, which amounted to 59.4%. It can be concluded that Pancasila Education has smaller significant effect on the Faithfulness Formation of the students than Religion Education, which has significant effect. From the results of this study it became clear about the study of what types of education had a significant influence on the formation of the Faitfulness of the students. And the implication is that Religion Education should be delivered more intensively and seriously if we idealized to format faitfulness of our students as the young generation. Therefore, the students as the young generation not only having religion, but they have to be religious and faithful persons. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

As the leader, whoever should be accountable is not only on the horizontal level and at the vertical level as well. Phenomenological studies and literature about the practice of leadership are faced with a number of theories about leadership and then synthesized into more whole leadership rather than just to brand a leadership itself. Based on the assumption a leader is merely a sociological problem that needs to be completed with a spiritual dimension, while in its historical development of leadership, it is never excluded from the spiritual dimension. This article concludes that self-giving as a spiritual dimension in leadership will give more benefit to develop the life system as well as the purpose of leadership itself rather than the apparent leadership, which actually hurts or even manipulate the members for the sake of egoistic the leader and their inner circle. Therefore, it is very important for education to teach self-giving as a spiritual dimension to all students of the World, especially in Asia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Sports; Historical development; Education",,,,,,"Freeman, G.T., Spirituality and servant leadership.

A leader should also be accountable not only on the horizontal level but also at the vertical level. Phenomenological studies and literature about the practice of leadership are faced with a number of theories about leadership and then synthesized into the more authentic leaderships rather than just imaging or false branding leadership. Based on the assumption a leader (including in the political sphere) is merely a sociological problem that needs to be completed with spiritual dimension, while in its historical development of leadership, it is never excluded from the spiritual dimension, although manipulative (just because common people understand that leadership came from the “sky” (gods), resulting in a tyrannical king, which eventulally led to the birth of authentic leadership as popularized by Robert K. Greenleaf as the servant leadership. This article concludes that an authentic leadership will give more benefit to develop the life system as well as the purpose of leadership itself rather than the apparent leadership, which actually hurts the members (people). Therefore, it is very important for education to teach this to all students of the World. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.","Authentic leadership; Branding leadership; Spiritual leadership",,,,,,,"Arifin Abdulrachman, R., (1968) Leadership theory, Pengembangan dan Filosofi Kepemimpinan, , Dinas Latihan Djabatan Lembaga Administrasi Negara, Jakarta; Arisandi, D., Servant Leadership-Memimpin dengan Hati Untuk Melayani, , http://darisandi.wordpress.com/2010/04/17/; Berndt, H., (2006) Agama Yang Bertindak-Kesaksian Hidup dari Berbagai Tradisi, , http://posbali.com/ciri-ciri-pemimpin-buddhis/, A.B.

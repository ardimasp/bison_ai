One of the features of CRM are customer satisfaction level analyses. It is a verbal communication means of sending or receiving information. There are several intonations spoken during verbal communication that reflect the emotional state. Therefore, it can be used to get information regarding the level of customer satisfaction. Sound is one type of digital data that can be processed for an emotional state of classification. In this research, the authors decided to develop a mobile application that is integrated with machine learning to record a sound and classify it into a particular emotional state. This application is believed to be able to improve the user experience and simplify the installation to improve communication engagement. © 2019 IEEE.","component; formatting; style; styling","Android (operating system); Information management; Mobile computing; Public relations; Sales; Application development; component; Customer relationship management; formatting; Mobile applications; style; styling; Verbal communications; Customer satisfaction",,,,,"A Face Recognition System Based on Convolution Neural Network Using Multiple Distance Face, Soft Computing; A Simulation Model for the Waterfall Software Development Life Cycle, International Journal of Engineering & Technology, 25; Chennai, S., (2016) Salesforce, , https://www.salesforcetraining.education/importance-featuressalesforce-make-mandatory-learn/, July 26 Retrieved from www. salesforcetraining. education:; (2013) International Conference on Cognitive Infocommunications, 403-406, , Classification of Emotional Speech Units in Call Centre Interactions Budapest, IEEE; (2011) International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 5692-5695. , Iterative feature normalization for emotional speech detection Prague, Czech RepublicIEEE; (2015) Python in Science Conference, pp. 18-24. , librosa: Audio and Music Signal Analysis in Python; Speech Emotion Recognition Approaches in Human Computer Interaction, Telecommunication Systems, 523, pp. 1467-1478; Speech Emotion Recognition Using Support Vector Machine, International Journal of Smart Home, pp. 6101-6107; Priyotno, A., (2019), https://inet.detik.com/consumer/d-4446865/samsung-masih-rajaponsel-di-Indonesia-ini-daftar-5-besarnya, Feb 27 detik com.

Student graduation rate from 2011-2018 seen from the number of incoming students has decreased. These conditions become reference material for the majors to conduct evaluations and strategic steps in an effort to increase the level of graduation of students so that quality objectives can be achieved. Evaluation of majors needs to be improved by analyzing the factors that cause late graduation for a student. 3. For the purposes of training data Student data is used from 2011 2015, while for testing data Student data is used for 2016. The method used to predict is the Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System method. Based on the test results, training is conducted on the amount of training data as much as 50%, 60% and 70% of the total data available. While testing is conducted on the remaining training data consisting of percentages of 50%, 40% and 30%. For each data combination ten times (Epoch value) and then the average RMSE value is taken from the test. The smallest RMSE value was found in a combination of 60% training data and 40% test data which was 0.006380. The more training data shows the higher the level of accuracy. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

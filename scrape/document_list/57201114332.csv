On the other hand, the public oftentimes is surprised to get their position as a victim in doing something that is common in cyber space. Discrepancy between public perspective and law perspective created tension between the public and law enforcement. Gap of understanding within cyber space concept is because sometimes the law is difficult to catch the dynamic phenomenon in cyber space that shifts in very fast way with many convergence concepts. By the convergency principle in cyber space, this paper tries to discuss from the science of communication. In digital media, communication role is very important, because in cyber space of the backbone concept is communication, and one of the concepts of digital communication is digital proxemics that will be explored with literature review method. This paper found that proxemics concept can determine the scope of personal data protection from privacy and the distribution of information. © 2021 ICIC International","Cyber law; Cyber space; Cybercrime; Digital communication; Digital media; Digital proxemics",,,,,,,"Das, S., Nayak, T., Impact of cyber crime: Issues and challenges (2013) Int.

Its purpose is to reduce unemployment, job creation, and connecting business networks. This paper proposed a study in business incubator indicator performance and to find incubator service indicator performance factor from tenant after graduation from business incubator program. To evaluate and measure incubator service performance the keywords 'indicator service performance' is applied to papers discussing business incubators and the incubation process. There are 100 of papers matching the research questions and after revision 57 papers are identified for candidate study and finally 20 papers are selected for review. The candidate proposed four services demand under business incubator such as, (P1) infrastructure service as to provide affordable space for tenants, secondly (P2) which is affordable program education for tenants. Third (P3) business services include all aspect needed by tenants. Finally, the final service (P4) business planning assistance. © 2017 IEEE.","Business incubator; Indicator service; Systematic literature review","Employment; Business incubators; Business planning; Infrastructure services; Performance factors; Research questions; Service performance; Sustainable business; Systematic literature review; Planning",,,,,,"Mubarak Al-Mubaraki, H., Busler, M., Incubator successes: Lessons learned from successful incubators towards the twenty-first century (2014) World Journal of Science, Technology and Sustainable Development, 11 (1), pp. 44-52; Sungur, O., Business Incubators Networking Firm Survival, , Evidence from Turkey; Okoli, C., Schabram, K., A guide to conducting a systematic literature review of information systems research.

There are many messages that can be found in social media that need to be noticed so the messages from the user could reach the viewer. Social media provides promising as well as challenging data to business intelligence. By using data warehouse and business intelligence, the data from social media can be proceeded to monitor and understand adoption and sentiment. In this research, data warehouse and business intelligence will be designed and implemented using data from social medias; Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Youtube which are expected to be the source to do monitoring to social media contents that are shared by each stakeholder from the talk shows that are going to be analyzed. As for the sentiment analysis, word2vec, Naïve Bayes and Random Forest will be applied for the qualification methods. As a result, this monitoring is used to give understanding of how information spread and the sentiment which underlies the spreading messages could give critical perception to the management on how their product recognized and valued in society. © 2019 Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems.All right reserved.","Business Intelligence; Data Warehouse; Naïve Bayes; Random Forest; Sentiment Analysis; Word2vec",,,,,,"Indonesia, K.P., (2016) Survei Indeks Kualitas Program Siaran Televisi Periode 5 Tahun 2016; Timberg, B.M., (2002) Television Talk: A History of the Tv Talk Show, , The University Of Texas Press; Abdallah, A., Rana, N.P., Dwivedi, Y.K., Algharabat, R., Social media in marketing: A review and analysis of the existing literature (2017) Telemat.

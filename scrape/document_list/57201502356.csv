However, such studies tend to overlook on data and numbers rather than grounded and contextual turn. The present study used a contextual and qualitative analysis to investigate the identities and realities of university graduates through recurring themes and patterns in Twitter. Data for this case study was a corpus compiled from 345 tweets of 35 Twitter accounts of graduates from English Department in a private university in Indonesia. The corpus contained 4, 966 tokens and was analyzed using AntConc.3.5.8 (2019) for the recurring lexical use and collocations. Results showed that university graduates posed themselves as personally engaged, while formal addressing was used in rhetorical style. The graduates were also embalmed with issues related to work, parenting, marriage, and the current pandemic. The corpus also revealed the commonly collegiate style. The use of code-mixing between Indonesian and English in the tweets also further revealed the shared identity of the graduates. It could be concluded that social media postulated the lives and world of graduates and qualitative study of big data analysis could bring more comprehensive results. Implications for educators and university administrators in preparing students for life after university were included in the discussion. © 2020 IEEE.","Big data; Graduates; Identity; Twitter","Big data; Information management; Code-mixing; Indonesia; Qualitative analysis; Qualitative study; Social media; University graduates; Social networking (online)",,,,,,"Cammaerts, B., Social media and activism (2015) Journal of American College Health Publications, 31, pp. 1-8; Felt, M., Social media and the social sciences: How researchers employ big data analytics (2016) Big Data & Society January-June, pp. 1-15; McCormick, T.H., Lee, H., Ceare, N., Shojaie, N., Spiro, E.S., Using twitter for demographic and social science research: Tools for data collection and processing (2015) Sociological Methods & Research, pp. 1-32; Sebei, H., Taieb, M.A.H., Aouicha, M.B., Review of social media analytics process and big data pipeline (2018) Social Network Analysis and Mining, 8, pp. 30-42; Sivarajaha, U., Irania, Z., Guptab, S., Mahroofa, K., Role of big data and social media analytics for business to business sustainability: A participatory web context (2019) Industrial Marketing Management, pp. 2-20. , April; Gutiérrez-Martín, A., Torrego-González, A., The twitter games: Media education, popular culture and multiscreen viewing in virtual concourses (2017) Information, Communication & Society; Noll, M., Technology and the future of the university: A sober view (2000) Information, Communication & Society, 3 (4), pp. 645-647; Armstrong, L., A new game in town: Competitive higher education (2001) Information, Communication & Society, 4 (4), pp. 479-506; Fleming, F., College students' alcohol displays on facebook: Intervention considerations (2012) Journal of American College Health, 60 (5), pp. 388-394; Bennett, L., Segerberg, A., The logic of connective action (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 739-768; Allen, K.A., Ryan, T., Gray-DeLeon, A., McInerenet, D., Waters, L., Social media use and social connectedness in adolescents: The positives and the potential pitfalls (2014) Australian Journal of Educational and Developmental Psychology, 31 (1), pp. 18-31; Jackson, M.H., McDowell, S.D., Enhancing discourse on new technology within higher education (2000) Information, Communication & Society, 3 (4), pp. 629-638; Brown, M.E., Dustman, P.A., Juan, J.B., Twitter impact on a community trauma: An examination of who, what, and why it radiated (2020) Community Psychology, 1, pp. 1-16; Puschmann, C., Burgess, J., (2014) The Politics of Twitter Data, pp. 43-54. , K.

Usually, consumer will do a strategy to coping the confusion, that strategy is known as Confusion Reduction Strategy. The conventional ways usually taken by the consumer to reduce the confusion are, such as: Asking for product recommendation to close relatives, seeking for an additional product information on the internet and so on. However, suggestions and recommendations from conventional sources obtained by the consumer, sometimes are not always accurate (not objective) and time consuming (inefficient). Therefore, this research proposes a Decision Support System (DSS) application to cope with the confusion. In this study, the comparison results between conventional methods (such as: Asking advice to close relatives or seeking for an additional information on the internet) with the proposed method (the DSS) were presented. In addition, another implication of this study is to get the factors that causing consumer confusion in case of smartphone purchases. This research used mixed-method approach, implemented through interview and survey. Research samples were 136 potential smartphone buyers which are converted to 27 smartphone buyers; brand image is the main source of consumer confusion (mean 3.98, std. dev 0.86), followed by proliferation of brands, services and models of smartphone products (mean 3.89, std. dev 0.82). Respondents often use Word of Mouth (WoM) communication as main source of information to reduce the confusion, results of 16 from 27 transactions were contributed from WoM. DSS application contributed only 2 of 27 smartphone transactions. Further research for the development of mobile based DSS application as an alternative conventional CRS needs to be conducted, because of the potential success of static desktop based DSS application in reducing potential consumer confusion especially for value oriented buyers. © 2014 Science Publication.","Confusion Reduction Strategy; Consumer Confusion; Decision Support System; Fuzzy Logic; Simple Additive Weighting",,,,,,,"Afshari, A., Mojahed, M., Yusuff, R.M., Simple additive weighting approach to personnel selection problem (2010) Int.

Agriculture geneticists are faced with numerous computational obstacles with storing, processing, and analyzing genetic and trait data. We introduce a web application for large-scale agriculture genetic diversity and association studies that aims to simplify and automate many of the data management and analysis tasks common across studies. We present a case study where our software is configured and populated with genome-wide data of over 750,000 genetic markers from the commercially available BovineHD array (Illumina Inc.).

The diseases monitored by this study were diabetes, hypertension and tuberculosis. Data were collected through interviews with the company's human resources department and occupational health provider. As for the model, literature and online research were conducted to collect health standards and information system standards on existing DisMan systems. These standards were then compared to the consumer electronics manufacturer's DisMan. The model was designed by utilizing class, use-case, as well as sequence diagrams. The result was an information system model with a registry system that can specifically support DisMan in a consumer electronics manufacturer. The registry system included a medical alert management system and a self-monitoring system. The latter system was supported by the former system, which can assist the DisMan's staff in monitoring the employees' scrupulousness regarding their health care plan as well as notifying the employees on lifestyle management. © 2013 Science Publication.","Alert management system; Disease management; Information system model; Medical care plan; Self-monitoring",,,,,,,"Aiko, H., Domestic Violence (1995) Japanese Women: New Feminist Perspectives On the Past, Present and Future, pp. 265-267. , Fujimura-Fanselow, K. and A.

Individuals who have had their first stroke with permanent damage could become an economic burden to their family and a social burden to the society due to their unproductive nature. Stroke could be prevented and its risk factors have been identified. Through a stroke prevention information system, the user could be made more aware of stroke risks and symptoms. An expert system would be able to direct and motivate users to keep themselves healthy therefore preventing first and recurrent strokes. The expert system is built using an inference engine that provides stroke risk level based on information provided by the user. Information collected are self measured blood pressure, cigarettes consumed, amount of physical activity and body mass index. Users are presented with suggested preventive tasks to reduce their stroke risk. © 2013 Science Publications.",,,,,,,,"(2012) About Stroke, , ASA, American Heart Association; Biswas, M.M., Sen, S., Simmons, J., Etiology and risk factors of ischemic stroke in Indian- American patients from a hospital-based registry in New Jersey (2009) USA.

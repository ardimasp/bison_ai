Moreover, the current conditions for the unavailability of interactive learning media for blind children in Indonesian. The process of developing this application uses the Game Development Life Cycle (GDLC) method which consists of initiation, pre-production, production, testing, beta, and release. This application has been tested on several respondents. From this study, developing the useful application, easy to use, and accommodates all their needs. © 2019 The Authors.

The results of the study prove that the six risk factors perceived by consumers in shopping online have a negative and significant impact on consumer purchase intentions. Among the factors studied, time/psychological risk factors are the main contributors to consumers in considering making an online purchase. © 2020 IEEE.","E-commerce; Online consumer behavior; Online purchase intention; Online purchasing","Electronic commerce; Information management; Linear regression; Sales; Surveys; Consumer purchase; Multiple linear regressions; Online surveys; Online transaction; Perceived risk; Purchase intention; Risk factors; Purchasing",,,,,,,"Doolin, B., Dillon, S., Thompson, F., Corner, J.L., Perceived risk, the internet shopping experience and online purchasing behavior: A New Zealand perspective (2005) J.

Questionnaire data collection came from buyers in the top six e-commerce in Indonesia with a purposive technique. We use PLS-based SEM analysis to answer hypotheses. As a result, we accepted all hypotheses, namely customization, contact interactivity, care, and character factors that had positive and significant effects on trust and buyer retention.

Alterations to service quality and price may lead to service degeneration and price unfairness, which will affect customer satisfaction and trust. The objective of this investigation was to figure out the role of service quality and price fairness in improving customer satisfaction and building customer trust in the airline industry in Indonesia. Questionnaire responses were collected from 300 randomly enrolled passengers at Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport Indonesia. This research took a verification approach by the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique. The results indicate that service quality, price fairness, and customer satisfaction played an important role in building customer trust. Customers’ positive experiences, optimum service quality, and price fairness perception enabled the airline company to be closer to them and build their trust. Satisfaction was proven to mediate the relationship of service quality and price fairness to customer trust. © 2020 by the authors;","Airline industry; Customer satisfaction; Customer trust; Price fairness; Service quality",,,,,,,,"Anderson, D.R., Sweeney, D.J., Williams, T.A., (2011) Essentials of Statistics for Business and Economics, , revised: Cengage Learning; Anderson, E.W., Fornell, C., Lehmann, D.R., Customer satisfaction, market share, and profitability: Findings from Sweden (1994) The Journal of Marketing, 58 (3), pp. 53-66; Anderson, J.C., Narus, J.A., A model of distributor firm and manufacturer firm working partnerships (1990) Journal of Marketing, 54 (1), pp. 42-58; Bebko, C.P., Service intangibility and its impact on consumer expectations of service quality (2000) Journal of Services Marketing, 14 (1), pp. 9-26; Bowman, D., Narayandas, D., Managing customer-initiated contacts with manufacturers: The impact on share of category requirements and word-of-mouth behavior (2001) Journal of Marketing Research, 38 (3), pp. 281-297; Chang, H.H., Wang, Y.-H., Yang, W.-Y., The impact of e-service quality, customer satisfaction and loyalty on e-marketing: Moderating effect of perceived value (2009) Total Quality Management & Business Excellence, 20 (4), p. 10; Chaudhuri, A., Holbrook, M.B., The chain of effects from brand trust and brand affect to brand performance: The role of brand loyalty (2001) Journal of Marketing, 65 (2), pp. 81-93; Chumpitaz Caceres, R., Paparoidamis, N.G., Service quality, relationship satisfaction, trust, commitment and business-to-business loyalty (2007) European Journal of Marketing, 41 (7-8), pp. 836-867; Cronin, J.J., Jr, Taylor, S.A., Measuring service quality: A reexamination and extension (1992) The Journal of Marketing, pp. 55-68; Darke, P.R., Dahl, D.W., Fairness and discounts: The subjective value of a bargain (2003) Journal of Consumer Psychology, 13 (3), pp. 328-338; de Ruyter, K., Bloemer, J., Peeters, P., Merging service quality and service satisfaction.

The primary objective of the study is to examine students’ intentions to become entrepreneurs as an impact of gamification model learning in Entrepreneurship or Business Plan courses in BINUS ONLINE Learning. Data collection was carried out for 400 students who took Entrepreneurship and Business Plan courses for 1 month using questionnaires. The data was then analyzed using multiple linear regression approach. The result shows that attitude towards behavior (ATB), perceived behavior control (PBS), and subjective norms partially give positive impacts and they are significant to entrepreneurial intentions. Perceived behavioral control (PBC) is the dominant factor in forming entrepreneurial intentions for students. © 2020 by the authors","Entrepreneurial Intentions; Long Distance Learning Program; Planned Behavior",,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; (2019) Pertumbuhan Ekonomi Indonesia Triwulan IV-2018.

Customer retention is the form of loyalty related to the behavior measured on the consumer purchase behavior indicated by the high frequency of buying a service, so that the company which wants to know the level of customer retention must see the customer behavior in using its service. This study describes the results of survey on on-line transportation service, namely Gojek, Grab, and Uber in Jakarta, Bandung and Medan. The research methodology uses a survey on 400 users of on-line transportation service and refers to customer retention modelling. The essence of this research is that customer behavioral intention on the on-line transportation service will determine whether they are retained or not based on the customer characteristics and the perception of service employee’s orientation to customer. Furthermore, the findings in this research indicate that consumer’s behavioral intention becomes necessary to be studied by business players in on-line transportation. © 2017, Czestochowa University of Technology.

As a financial institution in the form of cooperative, the credit union had owned and controlled by the members who use its services. Professional management had made CU stronger with regard to solidarity aspect of the stakeholders in it. The use of information technology for service activity in order to keep the solidarity, members also had participated in the growth of the Credit Union, but there are some values of contribution that still unknown, such as the contribution of information technology and the participation of members. The research problem formulated to (a) produce new research on the influence of IT innovation, IT resource, IT service and the involvement of consumer in enhancing business growth; (B) create a hypothetical test design in order to know the influence of each variable in this research. This research aims to produce model and hypothetical test design to recognize the influence of IT innovation, IT resource, IT service and consumer involvement in enhancing business growth. This research was designed with unit explanatory survey that analyzed by organization. Furthermore, this research applied mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative) and triangulation strategy. The sample included 58 Credit Union is measured by using the formula Slovin. Credit Union (CU) determined by simple random sampling technique because it is based on the contribution of information technology and consumer involvement in business growth. This study only produces a research proposal model without providing results that illustrate the role of information technology and empirical consumer involvement. © 2017 IEEE.","Business Growth; Consumer Engagement; IT Innovation; IT Resource; IT Service","Business growth; Consumer Engagement; IT innovation; IT resources; IT services",,,,,"Zehir, C., Acar, A.Z., Tanriverdi, H., Identifying organizational capabilities as predictors of growth and business performance (2006) The Business Review, 5 (2), pp. 109-116; Bharadwaj, A.S., A resource-based perspective on information technology capability and firm performance: An empirical investigation (2000) MIS Quarterly, pp. 169-196; Ogega, D.A., Wanjau, K., Mkala, D.M., The effect of information technology on growth of micro-insurance business: A survey of commercial insurance companies in Kenya (2015) European Journal of Business and Innovation Research, 3 (4), pp. 10-18; Di Gangi, P.M., Wasko, M., The co-creation of value: Exploring user engagement in user-generated content websites (2009) Proceedings of JAIS Theory Development Workshop.

This research used a sample of multinational companies listed in the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX) from the period of 2010 to 2012. The data analysis was based on the company's financial statements generated from the IDX. Transfer pricing aggressiveness was measured by TPRICE index, which consists of items that represent occurrences of non-arm's length transactions. Six determinants of transfer pricing aggressiveness were tested in this study, including firm size, profitability, leverage, intangible assets, multi-nationality and tax haven utilisation. To test the model, multiple regression analysis was applied. Based on the results, the authors discovered that firm size and leverage are positively associated with transfer pricing aggressiveness, while intangible assets and multi-nationality are negatively associated. This study also shows that profitability and tax haven utilisation are not related to transfer pricing aggressiveness. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Arm's length principle; Indonesia; Tax avoidance; Transfer pricing",,,,,,"Bebchuk, L., Cohen, A., Ferrell, A., What matters in corporate governance (2009) Review of Financial Studies, 22 (2), pp. 783-827; Bernard, A.B., Jensen, J.B., Schott, P.K., Transfer pricing by US-based multinational firms (2006) NBER Working Paper Series 12493, , http://www.nber.org/papers/w12493; Brown, L., Caylor, C., Corporate governance and firm valuation (2006) Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, 25 (4), pp. 409-434; Conover, T.L., Nichols, N.B., A further examination of income shifting through transfer pricing considering firm size and/or distress (2000) The International Journal of Accounting, 35 (2), pp. 189-211; (2009) Dormant Accounts, , http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/about/pdf/gba10.pdf, Department for Business Enterprise & Regulatory Reform; Desai, M., Dharmapala, D., Corporate tax avoidance and high powered incentives (2006) Journal of Financial Economics, 79, pp. 145-179; Desai, M., Dyck, A., Zingales, L., Theft and taxes (2007) Journal of Financial Economics, 84 (3), pp. 591-623; Dharmapala, D., What problems and opportunities are created by tax havens (2008) Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation, 24 (4), pp. 661-679; Duhigg, C., Kocieniewski, D., How Apple sidesteps billions in taxes (2012) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/business/apples-tax-strategy-aims-at-low-tax-states-and-nations.html?_r=0; Dyreng, S., Hanlon, M., Maydew, E., Long-run corporate tax avoidance (2008) The Accounting Review, 83 (1), pp. 61-82; (2011) Tracking Global Trend: How Six Key Developments Are Shaping the Business World, , http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Tracking_global_trends/$FILE/Tracking%20global%20trends.pdf; Gravelle, J., Tax havens: International tax avoidance and evasion.

Fifty-eight companies were taken as samples, selected through industrial classification and selection criteria of leader and follower stocks. The data is analysed using Vector Auto Regression method to extrapolate and investigate the existence of lead-lag effects in Indonesian capital market. This study finds that returns to stocks with relatively high market capitalizations lead returns to stocks with relatively low market capitalizations in Indonesian industry portfolios. However, out of ten industries, there are only six who contribute significant result. This research concludes that lead-lag effects do exist in certain industries and it may assist investors in managing the trading strategy.

To fulfill the objective, the “blue chip” Indonesian companies are chosen. The research data period is 2007–2011 and taken quarterly. Technical analysis uses previous quarter return to predict current quarter returns. Fundamental analysis uses operating cash flow and price-to-book ratio. Integrated analysis combines these three variables to test the combined predictive power over current quarter stock returns. The results are compared using multiple regression analysis. Change in price-to-book ratio is significant and can help predict stock returns while previous quarter returns do not have predictive power of the next quarter returns, possibly due to the volatility in Indonesian market. Operating cash flow, while important, does not have predictive power over stock returns, possibly due to it not being an important factor in making investment decisions in Indonesia. Potential investors should understand Price-to-Book ratio and use it in any analysis concerning stock returns. They should also be prudent not to make investment decisions based on historical stock returns. Operating cash flow-generating ability is not one of the indicators the market watches out for. Integrated analysis outperforms a purely technical analysis, but not a purely fundamental analysis. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

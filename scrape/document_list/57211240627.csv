The automotive industry today is reaching out to wider range of users, being accessible in various shapes, sizes and range of mobility. However, the still ongoing vehicular thefts and the fact that it's also difficult at times to report to authorities in regards of the matter has brought forth several problems, such as lack of necessary means to reclaim vehicles, expensive GPS tracker prices, all while having the aforementioned tools that are not quite user-friendly. Using research and experiments on Arduino micro-controllers, and mobile development using Android Studio SDK, such a system was developed. From this system, which was tested by various ranges of age and occupation, it has been concluded and proven that a creation of fair-priced, user-friendly, and functional tracking system is very much possible. This system also operates offline, which is very useful when users are lacking internet connections. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

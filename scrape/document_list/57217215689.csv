The assessment was conducted for temperature and pressure. The measurements were performed offline and online. Offline measurement was by locating drone inside a controlled chamber, while online measurement was when drone is flying. Assessment shows that there were significant error differences in temperature, where offline drone exerted only 0.75% error, but online drone produced 6.23% error. Error increases as temperature increases. Pressure assessment exerted a slight error different between offline and online drone, 0.16% and 0.17%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"This research has been supported by TALENTA USU research grant 2020.","Giones, F., Brem, A., From toys to tools: The co-evolution of technological and entrepreneurial developments in the drone industry (2017) Business Horizons, 60 (6), pp. 875-884; Chand, G.S.L.K., Lee, M., Shin, S.Y., Drone based wireless mesh network for disaster/military environment (2018) Journal of Computer and Communications, 6 (4), p. 44; Pobkrut, T., Eamsa-Ard, T., Kerdcharoen, T., (2016) 2016 13th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics.

Instead, rice is a staple food for about half of the world's population. Some studies show that white rice consumption contributes greatly to the development of type 2 diabetes. Type-2 and type-1 diabetes is caused by obesity which requires tracking carbohydrate intake accurately. Especially in Indonesia, the calculation of the Carbohydrate Adequacy Number (CAN) refers to the regulation of the Minister of Health of the Republic of Indonesia Number 75 of 2013 concerning Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA). To fulfill daily consumption needs of carbohydrates so as not to overdo it, in this study rice dispensers were made to be able to regulate rice consumption needs according to the daily Carbohydrate Adequacy Number (CAN). Rice Dispenser is made using hardware from four half-bridge load cells, HX711 as ADC module, microcontroller NodeMCU and ESP8266 which functions as data communication via WiFi that is connected to online software. On the server side as monitoring and control in consuming rice every day is regulated through the application in real time. From the results of testing both hardware and software, rice dispensers that have been made can work well. The remote control also functions well and in measuring the mass of rice, rice dispensers can measure accurately. Likewise, when removing rice from a rice dispenser it works automatically and is scheduled by setting on the server side. As for testing, the average error values obtained from the measurement results obtained are 1.45 and 6.6. © 2019 IEEE.","carbohydrate; load cell; NodeMCU; rice dispenser; server","Carbohydrates; Computer hardware; Controllers; Remote control; Software testing; Well testing; Average errors; Data-communication; Hardware and software; Monitoring and control; On-line softwares; Recommended dietary allowances; Server sides; Type-2 diabetes; Dispensers",,,,,,"Mayne, S.T., Spungen, J.H., The us food and drug administration's role in improving nutrition: Labeling and other authorities (2017) J.

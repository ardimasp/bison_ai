There are many table to be processed for the data, because of that it's hard to show the report quickly. PT XYZ needs fast and reliable report to be shown, especially for control or audit. The suggested solution is to use data warehouse, because it has more structured storage and the data can be analysed by OLAP analysis that has the capability to show the data quickly. Data warehouse development was done through nine step that has been designed by Kimball and Ross. With this solution, PT XYZ has the capability to maintain quality of the product by monitoring the process and the data. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data warehouses; Risk management; Systems engineering; Data warehouse development; Product defect analysis; Reporting service; Digital storage",,,,,"Rabuzin, K., (2014) Int.

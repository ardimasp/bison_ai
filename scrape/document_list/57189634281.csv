The approach used in this research is a qualitative research approach with the type of descriptive explorative research. The model produced by this research involves five groups of stakeholder, namely government, society, private sector/industry, media and scientists. The role of the five stakeholders is mapped in three types of stakeholders, namely key stakeholders primary stakeholders and secondary stakeholders. Disaster preparedness logistics activities in this research are divided into four activities, namely facility location, stock prepositioning, resource allocation, and relief distribution, while the collaboration indicators set in this research are partnership, participation and network. The mapping of stakeholders and the formulation of stakeholders collaboration models in this research was carried out by the FGD (Focus Group Discussion) process, which consisted of representatives from all groups of stakeholder.The concept model obtained from this paper can be used as a basis for the preparation of the blueprint of the National Logistics System for Disaster Management in Indonesia that can help disaster management actors collaborate in carrying out logistics activities in disaster preparedness, so that logistical activities in disaster preparedness can be carried out quickly, precise and accurate. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Disaster Logistics; Disaster Preparedness; Logistics; Stakeholder Collaborative","Disaster prevention; Logistics; Mapping; Collaboration models; Disaster management; Disaster preparedness; Facility locations; Logistical activities; Qualitative research; Relief distribution; Stakeholder Collaborative; Disasters",,,,,,"UNISDRU Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 (2015) United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction Geneva; Fairuza, M., (2016) Kolaborasi Antar Stakeholders Dalam Pembangunan Inklusif Pada Sektor Pariwisata (Studi Kasus Wisata Pulau Merah di Kabupaten Banyuwangi); Bryson, J.M., What to do when stakeholders matter: A guide to stakeholder identification and analysis techniques (2003) London School of Economics and Political Science, p. 10; (2009) Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction, , UNISDRG; O'Brien, G., O'Keefe, P., Gadema, Z., Swords, J., Approaching disaster management through social learning (2010) Disaster Prevention and Management: An International Journal, 19 (4), pp. 498-508; Rodríguez-Espíndola, O., Albores, P., Brewster, C., Disaster preparedness in humanitarian logistics: A collaborative approach for resource management in floods (2018) European Journal of Operational Research, 264 (3), pp. 978-993; Ishiwatari, M., Flood risk governance: Establishing collaborative mechanism for integrated approach (2019) Progress in Disaster Science, 2",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

This model is expected to be able to generate the type and amount of relief supplies required by those affected during the emergency phase. This research develops ANN using supervised learning paradigm, and backpropagation learning algorithm. The applied ANN network architecture is a multiple-layer system, with 1 (one) neuron used in both input and output layer, and 95 (ninety-five) neurons used in the hidden layer yielding 0.99971 as the greatest value of the correlation coefficient. The output variable in this study is the earthquake impact consisting of six variables. While the input variables (predictors) in this study consisting of eight variables. The model in this study utilizes 123 seismic datasets, divided into 100 data (80%) for the training process and 23 data (20%) for the testing process. This research adds to the existing research and demonstrates the application of ANN in predicting the numbers of damaged buildings and casualties.

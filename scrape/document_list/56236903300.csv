Large businesses are expected to encourage the growth of micro, small and medium business. However, it turned out that the crisis had stopped the success of Indonesia's economic development, which resulted in many large businesses experiencing bankruptcy and largescale termination of employment. In contrast to large businesses, micro and small businesses recover faster from the crisis, and workers who are affected are absorbed into these micro and small businesses. Speed of recovery of micro and small businesses due to the more flexible nature of the business, relatively small capital, and generally does not depend on imported raw materials and foreign debt. Also, many micro and small businesses have sprung up and have begun to have an important role in Indonesia's national economy. In 2017, micro and small businesses made a stagnant ante to Indonesia GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of 60.34%. Therefore, it is important to maintain the stability of the performance or even improve it. The purpose of this study was to analyse the effect of market orientation, marketing capabilities, and product innovation on the performance of micro and small businesses, especially in West Jakarta. The number of samples is determined using the Slovin formula, which is 270 samples of 835 population, micro and small business people in West Jakarta City who already had a Micro Small Business License. While data collected using a questionnaire it was analysed using SPSS software. The results indicate that the most influential on the business performance is product innovation and followed by marketing capability, then the last is market orientation. © 2019, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Business performance; Market orientation; Marketing capability; Micro and small business; Product innovation",,,,,,"Authors would like to thank respondent who wholeheartedly willing to fill out the questionnaire despite their busy days, support from the SMEs West Jakarta and to our university.","Abbas, D., Pengaruh Modal Usaha, Orientasi Pasar dan Orientasi Kewirausahaan terhadap Kinerja UKM Kota Makassar (2018) Jurnal Manajemen, Ide, Inspirasi (MINDS), 5 (1), pp. 95-111. , (Januari-Juni) 2018; Ali, H., (2013) Marketing dan Kasus-Kasus Pilihan, , Yogyakarta: Center for Academic Publising Servive; Andalan, dan Hikmah, T.R., Faktor-Faktor yang Mempengaruhi Kinerja UMKM Di Kabupaten dan Kota Semarang (2013) E-Jurnal Manajemen Untag, 2 (1), pp. 102-114; Assauri, S., (2007) Manajemen Pemasaran, , Dasar, Konsep dan Strategi.

Research focus on students because students are one of the promising young age segments and many use technologies. This mobile banking service is needed by users to increase the mobility of the use of services at the bank for all financial transactions. The developed mobile banking must have several factors that must be met, among others: security factors in transactions and personal data information from users, user data confidentiality factors, risk factors in service use, trust factors of service users, service usability factors, and service factors in mobile banking. Data collection by distributing questionnaires using Google forms and the results obtained were 340 respondents. The analysis was performed using quantitative techniques with SEM with analysis software is SMARTPLS 3.0. The analysis shows that there are four factors that significantly influence the use mobile banking, namely Security and Confidentiality, Perceived Trust, Perceived Risk, Services Mobile Banking. In addition, there is one factor that the Perceived of use smartphones does not affect the use of services mobile banking. The results show that users need the security and confidentiality of personal data and transactions carried out. This will indirectly increase user confidence in mobile banking, and the bank must reduce or eliminate all risks caused by mobile banking services. Knowing the influence of these factors can increase mobile usage in mobile services and increase usage interest, and the bank knows which services can be improved. © 2020 IEEE.","Mobile banking; Perceived of use; Perceived risk; Perceived trust; Security and confidentiality; Smartphone","Information management; Mobile security; Risk assessment; Smartphones; Students; Surveys; Analysis softwares; Data collection; Data informations; Financial transactions; Perceived trusts; Quantitative techniques; Security factors; Service usability; Banking",,,,,,"Hellstrand, A., Breckwoldt, M., (2016) Consumer Acceptace of Mobile Banking in Germany, , May; Singh, S., Srivastava, R.K., Predicting the intention to use mobile banking in India (2018) Int.

Several cases had been reported due to the usage of a fake transcript. One modus of using fake transcript is to enter a higher level of education and job promotion. The new technology found called Blockchain believes in solving the problem. Characteristics of Blockchain Technology such as secured, immutable, distributed, transparent seem to be matched with transcript document requirement. Therefore, the research tries to create a process model of the university teaching and learning process. Several studies have been done; however, no detailed process shown especially for teaching and learning activities. The research question is, how are teaching, and learning activities can be supported by Blockchain Technology? Qualitative method used in this research, focus group discussion with 9 reputable universities discussed the academic operation process and the result show that it is possible to adopt Blockchain Technology into the teaching and learning process to avoid forgery of university transcript documents. © 2020 IEEE.","Blockchain technology; Blockchain technology-based; Teaching and learning process; Transcript","Blockchain; Information management; Teaching; Innovative solutions; Learning Activity; Level of educations; Operation process; Qualitative method; Research questions; Teaching and learning; University teaching; Learning systems",,,,"12/AKM/PNT/2019","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This study is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Implementasi Blockchain Platform Untuk Menciptakan “Good Governance” pada Perguruan Tinggi” or “The Implementation of Blockchain Platform to Create“Good Governance” in Higher Education” with contract number: 12/AKM/PNT/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","Ari, S., (2015) Perguruan Tinggi Harus Waspadai Transkrip Nilai Palsu-Tribun Jogja, , https://jogja.tribunnews.com/2015/01/09/perguruan-tinggi-haruswaspadai-transkrip-nilai-palsu, jogja.

In this part, the phenomena evolved in many countries. In line with this, early research reported the impact of learning using social media by researchers, both positive and negative impact on the university student. However, the researchers encountered demanding effort to obtain the research report on the causal impact of university student background, such as academic achievement, terms, and student social media behavioural activities. This ceaseless research attempts to explore the gap attributed. Therefore, this quantitative and causal or explanatory research will convey the social media impact of behavioural use for the learning of university student. The research involved 336 university students as the respondent in this research. Technically, SPPS application is used to process the data with Correlation Bivariate technique. The research found 29 correlations regarding the university student background and the activities of using media social for learning and a debatable result emerged from early research eventually. © 2020 IEEE.","Explanatory research; Quantitative method; Social media; Social media for learning; SPSS bivariate","Information management; Social networking (online); Academic achievements; Bivariate; Learning media; Research reports; Social media; University students; Students",,,,,,"Syed Ahmed, M., Kabir, S.M.A., The acceptance of smartphone as a mobile learning tool: Students of business studies in Bangladesh (2018) Malaysian Online J.

Where this time, raising problems one of the social distancing that affects a service provided, especially on services that use technology that applies SST. This study develops from previous research where the customer has satisfaction in using SST services. Still, this use does not know a person intention to use SST services, so it is necessary to develop with several factors the adoption of technology, namely influence that can make a person intention to use. The research framework of this research consists of several factors and indicators, namely efficiency (4 indicators), Reliability (4 indicators), security (3 indicators), Convenience (3 indicators), Ease of use (4 indicators). This study uses an online survey with google form for users of self-service technology services in 5 major cities in Indonesia. Dissemination of the survey for three months, and the obtained were 100 respondents valid. This research conducts testing using Smarpls v3.0. The results of this study found two factors that influence perceived usefulness, namely: efficiency and reliability, and found three factors that did not have an impact, namely Security factors, Convenience Factors, Perceived Ease of use, and Service Trust do not have an impact on perceived usefulness. This result is a very interesting finding because during the period pandemic COVID-19. These factors are no longer the top priority in the use of SST services and do not affect who intention to use a technology service. Thus, it can be concluded that whose intention at a certain level of the problem will prioritize the reliability and efficiency of the system for service. This factor can be the focus of the company in developing systems that adopt Self-service technology. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

In its development, many banking companies or those outside have taken the initiative to make mobile banking services more useful for all customers or their use. Therefore, it is necessary to understand what factors influence the customer's intention to adopt mobile banking with a smartphone. For this reason, development is needed in making conceptual models. This development of conducting a literature review is very important to expand the theory found scientifically. It is evaluated from instruments developed by testing validity and reliability using smart pls 2.0 and using the snowball sampling technique for sampling respondents. Distribution of instruments is done with Google Form. Data collected 258 respondents, and valid respondent data obtained 240 respondents to use. The results of this study are conceptual models that have seven variables: security, confidentiality, Perceived trust, Perceived of use smartphones, mobile banking services, the use of mobile banking and the development of instruments producing 39 instruments. The reliability test with Cronbach's alpha value above 0.5 and AVE value above 0.6. Validity test with a cross-loading value above 0.6, which value stated that the instrument was eligible to collect data from a larger survey in this study. © 2019 IEEE.","Adoption; Conceptual model; Mobile Banking; Smartphone","Instrument testing; Sales; Adoption; Conceptual model; Cronbach's alphas; Customer behavior; Literature reviews; Mobile bankings; Reliability test; Sampling technique; Smartphones",,,,,,"Singh, S., Srivastava, R.K., Predicting the intention to use mobile banking in India (2018) Int.

In this line, GoJek is one of the most famous Online Transportation Companies (OTC). As this backdrop, early research reported that single female used the Online Transportation System frequently. In the other angle, passenger's safety, especially for female passenger, has become issues. In this scope, several new findings reported the victim of female passengers. From that lesson, National Police advises the OTC to perform the physiological test for the driver due to security concern. Therefore, the research explored the relationship between the risk factor of the online transportation system for female passenger. In this study, SPSS is used to find the correlation bivariate function and to explain how extent the correlation of risk factor with the passenger background is.

With the vastness of the area, Indonesia has so many and scattered tourist attractions. Indonesia is also a target of tourism by local and foreign tourists. Problems that occur are many tourist attractions that can not be known by tourists so that they experience a severe problem in getting information related to the culinary. One of the problems of information about its existence, which is spread in several locations and knowledge about the area that is not good, especially for tourists from outside the city. Of course, if this is ignored continuously will have a negative impact on culinary tourism, such as the lonely tourists who come to visit in the country of Indonesia. This study provides a solution that is seen from the existing problems; it is necessary to answer the need for fast and more efficient information about culinary attractions in Indonesia, namely by developing an Android-based GIS-based application that provides an easy search for information and culinary tourism locations. User required. Software development uses the waterfall method and tests on users with questionnaires to users. The results of this study, culinary tourism mobile applications that are based on the results of tests carried out obtain a percentage score of 81-100, which can be interpreted that this application is very feasible to use and apply to provide culinary information. © 2019 IEEE","Android; Culinary Tour; Geographic Information System; Mobile","Android (operating system); Information systems; Information use; Software design; Software testing; Surveys; Android; Culinary Tour; Existing problems; Gis-based; Mobile; Mobile applications; Tourist attractions; Waterfall methods; Geographic information systems",,,,,,"Fernando, E., Touriano, D., Murad, D.F., Bimo, A.C., Pemetaan dan analisa sebaran tempat public pada kecamatan jambi Timur di kota jambi dengan sistem informasi Geografis (2018) J.

In this point, the transaction raises several new and crucial challenges. At a closer look, the concerns appeared due to no data integration, verification, and validation from parties both inside or outside of the university. In this respect, the data is not centralized or integrated. As this backdrop, this causes repeated data confirmation, and no one can authenticate the data validity when distributed to other parties. In this point of entry, the diploma certification forgery has become one of the significant issues in education in Indonesia. As a framework that enables the data integration, Blockchain contains verified data on every single of a transaction, so the data is trustworthy. With this in mind, this paper aims to discuss the best blockchain model for the university level. This study is qualitative-based research. As a result, McRhys model is introduced as a potential and implementable blockchain model in university in Indonesia. © 2019 IADIS Press.

The growing city of Jakarta is facing various international events, increasing the complexity of these congestion problems. This research is aimed to propose an alternative solution for congestion problem in Jakarta using Cased-Based Reasoning (CBR) approach on Pejompongan area. The CBR integrated model analyzes congestion at a given point in a particular hour to identify the same case. The Cased-Based Management (CBM) algorithm approach is used to capture transient problems and ultimately reduce case base cases for their contribution to long-term maintenance. Congestion data is obtained from CCTV cameras via website lewatmana.com in some strategic areas. With that data, we use CBR's integrated model to adjust traffic time for traffic flow to be optimized so that congestion will decompose. The results of this study can be used by relevant government agencies and policymakers in Jakarta to formulate the best solution to solve the congestion problem in the Indonesian capital. Image analysis at nights and bad weather conditions become a limitation and also the integration with traffic lights control in this paper that can be a new topic for further research. © 2018 IEEE.","Case based reasoning;

With the recurring spread of fake news in recent time, it provides opportunities for higher education students to be able to receive and spread the fake news through LINE group. The purpose of this research: first, to show college students' activities and the intention of awareness to receive fake news by users. Second, to measure the number of college student groups with awareness of spread fake news. Third, to investigate whether Higher education students with many groups can make or modify fake news. There are 15 questions using a Likert scale and 5 multiple choice questions which are shown to higher education students and presented by using statistical descriptive explanatory analysis for this research. The result of this research is higher education students have many groups and this does not affect the number of fake news because Higher education students need to do advanced research on the news and see if the news has a reliable source. The number of groups in the LINE mobile application imposes no effect on the spread of fake news. © 2017 IEEE.","Fake News; Groups; Higher education students; LINE; Social Media","Information management; Mobile computing; Social networking (online); Fake News; Groups; Higher education students; LINE; Social media; Students",,,,,,"Penyebar Berita Hoax di Indonesia Bisa Raup Rp700 Jutaan, , https://www.cnnindonesia.com/teknologi/20161202085641185-176767/penyebar-berita-hoax-di-indonesia-bisa-raup-rp700-jutaan/, [Online], [Accessed: 20-Aug-2017]; Kehadiran Hoax Hari Ini Oleh Abel Salsabil-Kompasiana.com, , http://www.kompasiana.com/abelsalsabil/kehadiranhoax-hari-ini_593029294b7a6171097eb915, [Online], [Accessed: 20-Aug-2017]; Hoax Jadi Ladang Bisnis Karena Masyarakat Kurang Kritis, , http://www.beritasatu.com/digital-life/449615-hoax-jadiladang-bisnis-karena-masyarakat-kurang-kritis.html, [Online], [Accessed: 30-Aug-2017]; Awas Hoax!

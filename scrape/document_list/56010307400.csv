With a joint scheme, investors can buy a portion of project or business ownership with a relatively small nominal purchase. However, investors need tools to facilitate the search and purchase of projects or businesses that match their character. This research is intended to design a Web-based Crowdfunding Platform model that suits the needs of investors. This study uses the questionnaire method to obtain investor information requirements data. As for model designing, this study employed the Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) method, and used notation from the Unified Modeling Language (UML) standard. The result of this study is a Web-based Crowdfunding Platform model that facilitates investors to choose and arrange investment portfolios that are appropriate to their preferences. © 2020 IEEE.","Crowdfunding; Model; OOAD; UML","Information management; Investments; Object oriented programming; Purchasing; Unified Modeling Language; Websites; Business ownership; Information requirement; Investment portfolio; Object oriented analysis and design; Platform models; Stock exchange; Web based; Crowdsourcing",,,,,"Crowdfunding is a method of raising funds from many investors through an online platform to capitalize on startup company project instead of funding from banks or loan providers [7].

Since fashion is the most favorite item category in Indonesia, there are lots of fashion e-commerce grown in the country. One of the unsatisfactory conditions that are occurred in fashion e-commerce in Indonesia is user drop off. By using funnel analysis, the product detail page of fashion e-commerce founded as the page with the most user drop off. To tackle this problem, several experiments were prepared. With A/B testing, the experiments that possibly improved the conversion rate were identified. This research discovered experimental version of the User Interface (UI) of the product detail page by manipulating button colors, layout, and delivering comprehensible information to users. © 2020 IEEE.","A/B testing; Conversion rate; E-commerce; Funnel analysis; User drop off","Drops; Electronic commerce; Information management; A/b testing; Conversion rates; Indonesia; Item category; Physical stores; Product and services; User interfaces",,,,,,"(2019) Most Purchased Products on 11. 11 Shopping Event Amongst Respondents in Indonesia As of November 2018 by Category, , Statista.com, Statista. com; Maulia, E., (2019) Indonesia Seeks Lead in Global Modest-fashion Industry; Muller, J., (2019) Most Popular E-commerce Sites for Fashion in Indonesia As of 3rd Quarter 2019, by Monthy Web Visits, , Statista.com2; Rahutomo, R., Perbangsa, A.S., Soeparno, H., Pardamean, B., Embedding model design for producing book recommendation (2019) Proc. 2019 Int.

We hence develop a database system which enables time series monitoring on the expected increment of children's physical growth. At this initial step, our database system will be implemented at Public Health Office (Dinas Kesehatan) of Serdang Bedagai, South Celebes. This is a modification from Connoly and Begg's principles. Our database was built through 3-steps design started with conceptual followed by logical and at final step was normalizations-enriched physical design.

Its purpose was to determine the correlation between independent variables consisting of Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Attitude toward Using (AU) with dependent variable Behavioral Intention to Use (BIU). Data collection techniques were carried out by distributing questionnaires through group discussion forums. Respondents consisted of medical workers and health cadres both in Jakarta and Yogyakarta. Data were analyzed using correlation test and t-test. The results of the correlation test state that the correlation between PEU and AU is 0.30, which shows a weak correlation. Meanwhile, the correlation of PU and AU is 0.56, PEU and BIU is 0.41, and PU and BIU is 0.47, which are considered as moderate correlations. Finally, a strong correlation exists between AU and BIU. T-test results show that the effect of PU on AU is statistically significant with CI = 95%. Likewise, the effects of PEU on AU, AU towards BIU, PU towards BIU, and PEU towards BIU are significant (p < 0.05). © Kassel University Press GmbH.","Cancer early detection; Mobile learning; TAM",,,,,,,"Dyanti, G.A.R., Suariyani, N.L.P., Faktor-Faktor Keterlambatan Penderita Kanker Payudara Dalam Melakukan Pemeriksaan Awal Ke Pelayanan Kesehatan (2016) Jurnal Kesehatan Masyarakat, 11 (2), pp. 96-104. , https://doi.org/10.15294/kemas.v11i2.3742; Muljo, H.H., Perbangsa, A.S., Pardamean, B., Assessment of Online Learning Application for Health Education (2019) International Journal of Online and Biomedical Engineering, 15 (12), pp. 69-80. , https://doi.org/10.3991/ijoe.v15i12.11157; Setiati, E., (2009) Waspadai Empat Kanker Ganas Pembunuh Wanita, Kanker Rahim, Kanker Indung Telur, Kanker Leher Rahim, Kanker Payudara, , https://doi.org/10.18860/sains.v0i0.1862, Yokyakarta: Andi; Fernández, M.E., DeBor, M., Candreia, J.D.M., Dissemination of a breast and cervical cancer early detection program through a network of community-based organizations (2010) Health Promotion Practice, 11 (5), pp. 654-664. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839908325064; Ngoc Nguyen, T.-U., Tanjasiri, S.P., Kagawa-Singer, M., Tran, J.H., Foo, M.A., Community Health Navigators for Breast-and Cervical-Cancer Screening Among Cambodian and Laotian Women: Intervention Strategies and Relationship-Building Processes (2008) Health Promotion Practice, 9 (4), pp. 356-367. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839906290251; Muljo, H.H., Pardamean, B., Perbangsa, A.S., The implementation of online learning for early detection of cervical cancer (2017) Journal of Computer Science, 13 (11), pp. 600-607. , https://doi.org/10.3844/jcssp.2017.600.607; Davis, F.D., Perceived Usefullness, Perceived Ease of Use, and User Acceptance of Information Technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3). , https://doi.org/10.2307/249008; Quinn, C., (2000) MLearning, , Mobile, Wireless, In-Your-Pocket Learning.

Recommendation system plays a major role to formulate and produce a series of recommendation based on users' behavior. Surprisingly, user-generated scoring or known as ratings are the main raw materials to learn the pattern of favorable contents of each user. As a part of collaborative filtering strategy, rating is considerable to be included in formulating recommended contents. In this research, the basic formulation to recommend books is discovered. The recommendation system has been tested on one random-picked user behavior and successfully has generated five recommended books by analyzing prior activities. The embedding model produced the recommended books with 59% of accuracy. This research is done to provide an insightful experience for developing content recommendation system in Binus University's corporate learning system. © 2019 IEEE.","collaborative filtering; rating; recommendation system; recommended literatures","Behavioral research; Collaborative filtering; Embeddings; Information management; Learning systems; Rating; Basic formulation; Content recommendations; Internet services; Model design; recommended literatures; User behaviors; User-generated; Recommender systems",,,,,,"Ricci, F., Shapira, B., Rokach, L., Recommender systems: Introduction and challenges (2015) Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 7-8. , Second Edition; Davidson, J., The YouTube video recommendation system (2010) Proc.

Information transparency is needed to maintain good governance and can also prevent corruption. However, information on the sustainability of development programs carried out by the government is much unknown to the public. In addition, the government must be burdened with public dissatisfaction due to fake news (hoax). The Ministry of Public Works has tried to build a website to disseminate its programs. However, measurement of the quality of the website is needed. This study uses questionnaires with a Likert scale to obtain user interface assessment data in accordance with the WebQual 4.0 method.

The development of online learning in supporting the success of health education programs for early detection of cervical cancer is the right solution to improve health workers knowledge. To measure user acceptance of the online learning applications, the study used Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) approach. Data collected from questionnaires then analyzed by calculating the frequency (proportion) of the total value, the interpretation of a score by looking for index% and interval. The final result of the calculation shows that all respondents agreed and strongly agreed with all four factors measured. The conclusions are the users believe that the use of learning online applications can reduce the task effort, improve job performance, give positive idea to use the technology, and consciously and expressed desire to run the online learning process in the future. © 2019 iJOE.","Cervical cancer; Early detection; Online learning; Technology Acceptance Model",,,,,,"This study was funded by a Competitive Grant of the Directorate of Research and Community Services of the Republic of Indonesia’s Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education.","Organization, W.H., ""Human papillomavirus and related cancers,"" (2010), Barcelona, Spain: WHO/ICO Information Centre on HPV and Cervical Cancer; Dwipoyono, B., Kebijakan pengendalian penyakit kanker (serviks) di Indonesia (2009) Indonesian Journal of Cancer, 3 (3), pp. 109-116; El Hajj, M.S., Hamid, Y., Breast cancer health promotion in Qatar: A survey of community pharmacists' interests and needs (2011) International Journal of Clinical Pharmacy, 35 (3), pp. 376-385. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11096-010-9449-y; Wootton, R., Bahaadinbeigy, K., Hailey, D., Estimating travel reduction associated with the use of telemedicine by patients and healthcare professionals: Proposal for quantitative synthesis in a systematic review (2011) BMC Health Services Research, 11, pp. 185-185. , https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-11-185; Means, B., Toyama, Y., Murphy, R., Bakia, M., Jones, K., (2009) Evaluation of Evidence-Based Practices in Online Learning: A Meta-Analysis and Review of Online Learning Studies, , Washington D.C: U.S Department of Education; Kaninnen, E., (2009) Learning Styles and E-Learning, Learning styles in virtual learning environments, , Tampere: Tampere University of Technology; Fry, K., E-learning markets and providers: some issues and prospects (2001) Education + Training, 43 (4-5), pp. 233-239. , https://doi.org/10.1108/eum0000000005484; Kirtman, L., Online versus in-class courses: An examination of differences in learning outcomes (2009) Teacher Education, 18 (2), pp. 103-116; You, J.W., Kang, M., The role of academic emotions in the relationship between perceived academic control and self-regulated learning in online learning (2014) Computers &Education, 77, pp. 125-133. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2014.04.018; Zimeras, S., Gortzis, L.G., Interactive tele-radiological segmentation systems for treatment and diagnosis (2012) International Journal of Telemedicine and Applications, 2012, pp. 1-15. , https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/713739; Chorbev, I., Sotirovska, M., Mihajlov, D., Virtual communities for diabetes chronic disease healthcare (2011) International Journal of Telemedicine and Applications, 2011, pp. 1-7. , https://doi.org/10.1155/2011/721654; Sorensen, C., Classrooms without walls: A comparison of instructor performance in online courses differing in class size (2014) MERLOT Journal of Online Learning and Teaching, 10 (4), pp. 569-576; Smith, S.B., Smith, S.J., Boone, R., Increasing access to teacher preparation: The effectiveness of traditional instructional methods in an online learning environment (2000) Journal of Special Education Technology, 15 (2), pp. 37-46. , https://doi.org/10.1177/016264340001500204; Gordon, M., Hodson, J., Kitchen, J., Lessons learned: Effectiveness of courses developed for aboriginal teacher candidates delivered at a distance (2014) International Journal of ELearning & Distance Education, 29 (2), pp. 1-24; Shonfeld, M., Ronen, L., Online learning for students from diverse backgrounds: Learning disability students, excellent students and average students (2015) The IAFOR Journal of Education, 3 (2), pp. 13-29. , https://doi.org/10.22492/ije.3.2.01; Fonolahi, A.V., Khan, M.G.M., Jokhan, A., Are students studying in the online mode faring as well as students studying in the face-to-face mode?

The legislation initiator unit in the ministry has the duty to propose legislation programs, conduct discussions, and publish legislation already ratified. However, the implementation of these processes still faces obstacles, ranging from submitting legislation program until publication is still done manually and in hardcopy form. From the list of approved legislation, only a few people can access it. This is due to the lack of publication and limited access to the public. The study intends to develop a system model that manages the legislation process, from proposing legislation, harmonization, and publication. Data collection on system requirements is done by spreading questionnaires, interviews, and literature studies.

Agriculture is also very strategic for national development because it absorbs 32 % of the labor market, the largest compared to the trade sector which is only 23 %, services as much as 16%, industry by 13% and construction around 5%. However, agriculture cannot be perceived as a sufficient livelihood for some farmers, which is indicated by a decline in the number of farmers by 1.1 % per year. Knowledge and information will be one of the important solution to the problem if it can be collected, accessed and implemented by farmers, so they can increase productivity, and sell high-value commodities. Agricultural Knowledge and Information System is a necessary instrument for that purpose because it is an efficient model of managing resources which will drive low cost model of operation and can be accessed anytime and anywhere. This study proposes an agricultural knowledge and innovation system model by conducting a literature review and questionnaire distribution to collected data, then followed by conducting system analysis and design with Object Oriented Analysis Design (OOAD) method. Furthermore, the study using use case diagram and class diagram in Unified Modeling Language (UML) notations. The results of this research are the comprehensive and robust system model to collect, manage, and disseminate agricultural knowledge and information in the context of best practices in the field. © 2018 IEEE.","agriculture; innovation; knowledge; system","Agriculture; Commerce; Digital storage; Information systems; Information use; Unified Modeling Language; Agricultural information systems; knowledge; Literature reviews; Managing resources; National development; Object-oriented analysis; system; System analysis and design; Information management",,,,,,"Hoornweg, D., Pope, K., Population predictions for the worlds largest cities in the 21st century (2017) Environ.

This research intended to create a model of web-based supply chain management (e-SCM) for Salt Industry. The data were gathered through interviews, questionnaires, and literature review. The analysis and design of the system used the Object Oriented Analysis & Design (OOAD) method which refers to Unified Process and using Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation. The analysis method is applied while the business is being operated and is based on the needs of the industry. The result of this research was an e-SCM system model that is intended to support operational activities for salt industry. © 2017 IEEE.","model; salt industry; supply chain management system; web-based","Information management; Models; Surveys; Unified Modeling Language; Websites; Analysis method; Business Process; Literature reviews; Object-oriented analysis; Operational activity; Salt industry; Supply chain management system; Web based; Supply chain management",,,,,,"Setywati, E., Integrating and strengthening of national salt industry policy through value chain management upgrading (2015) Journal of African & Asian Local Government Studies, 4 (1), pp. 54-71; Lalit, M.S.N., Kumar, A., Barriers and their relative importance to the adoption of green supply chain management in indian context (2014) International Journal of Engineering Research & Technology, 3 (1), pp. 2260-2269; Muysinaliyev, A., Aktamov, S., Supply chain management concepts: Literature review (2014) IOSR Journal of Business and Management (IOSRJBM), 15 (6), pp. 60-66; Chopra, S., Meindl, P., (2016) Supply Chain Management: Strategy, Planning, and Operation, , Pearson Education; León-Peña, J., E-business and the supply chain management (2008) Business Intelligence Journal, 1 (1), pp. 77-89; Otchere, A.F., Annan, J., Quansah, E., Assessing the challenges and implementation of supply chain integration in the cocoa industry: A factor of cocoa farmers in Ashanti region of Ghana (2013) International Journal of Business and Social Science, 4 (5), pp. 112-123; Hilman, M., (2012) Supply Chain Management Berbasis Layanan: Desain Dan Implementasi Prototipe Sistem, , Universitas Indonesia; Pefkaros, K., Using object-oriented analysis and design over traditional structured analysis and design (2008) International Journal of Business Research, 8 (2), pp. 219-227; Satzinger, J.W., Jackson, R.B., Burd, S.D., (2016) Systems Analysis and Design in A Changing World, , Cengage",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2nd International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2017","15 November 2017 through 17 November 2017",,134470,,9781538629307,,,"English","Proc.

The development of health knowledge can be disseminated by utilizing mobile application based learning technology as media. Many things have been done by the government through special programs, among others, carried out breast cancer awareness campaign through breast self-screening program. The positive impact of this effort has led to mobile applications for learning about early detection of cancer in Indonesia. The development of mobile learning is a continuation of previous online learning to help the process of early detection of cervical cancer. Data collection methods used observation, interview, and questionnaire techniques, while instructional designs use the ADDIE (Analysis Design Development Implementation Evaluations) model and methods for developing object-oriented programming systems using Unified Modeling Language (UML). The resulting output is the application of early detection of cancer-based mobile learning which is the virtue of this study. © 2018, International Association of Online Engineering.","Cancer; Early detection; Mobile learning",,,,,,,"Huang, Y.-M., Hwang, W.-Y., Chang, K.-E., Guest Editorial-Innovations in Designing Mobile Learning Applications (2010) Educational Technology & Society, 13 (3), pp. 1-2; Spector, J.M., (2013) Foundations of educational technology: Integrative approaches and interdisciplinary perspectives, , Routledge; Quinn, C.N., (2011) Designing mLearning: Tapping into the mobile revolution for organizational performance, p. 256. , San Francisco: Pfeiffer; Alsaadat, K., Mobile Learning and University Teaching (2009) International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN09), , Barcelona, Spain; Vinu, P.V., Sherimon, P.C., Krishnan, R., 'Towards pervasive mobile learning-the vision of 21st century' (2011) Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, 15, pp. 3067-3073. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.04.247; Yuen, S., Wang, S., M-learning: Mobility in Learning (2004) Proceedings of E-Learn 2004-World Conference on E-Learning in Corporate, Government, Healthcare, and Higher Education, pp. 2248-2252. , In J.

However, there are numerous difficulties in maintaining a reliable KM system. One of the challenges is to manage knowledge materials in video format. A video file contains complex data that lead to the difficulties in managing them. Without an intelligent system, managing videos for KM requires a laborious effort. In this paper, an intelligent framework for KM system, embedded with deep learning model, is proposed. The use of the deep learning model alleviates the heavy burden of video materials management in KM system.

Cataloging and linking genetic variation in Asian rice to important traits, such as quality and yield, is needed in developing superior varieties of rice. We develop a bioinformatics workflow for quality control and data analysis of genetic and trait data for a diversity panel of 467 rice varieties found in Indonesia. The bioinformatics workflow operates using a back-end relational database for data storage and retrieval. Quality control and data analysis procedures are implemented and automated using the whole genome data analysis toolset, PLINK, and the [R] statistical computing language. The 467 rice varieties were genotyped using a custom array (717,312 genotypes total) and phenotyped for 12 traits in four locations in Indonesia across multiple seasons. We applied our bioinformatics workflow to these data and present prototype genome-wide association results for a continuous trait - days to flowering. Two genetic variants, located on chromosome 4 and 12 of the rice genome, showed evidence for association in these data. We conclude by outlining extensions to the workflow and plans for more sophisticated statistical analyses. © 2014 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","agriculture genetics; bioinformatics; data analysis; genome-wide association study; statistical genetics; workflow","Communication systems; Data reduction; Food supply; Genes; Information technology; Quality control; Days to flowering; Genetic variation; Genome-wide association; Genome-wide association studies; Relational Database; Statistical computing; Statistical genetics; workflow; Bioinformatics",,,,,,"International rice genome sequencing project: The map-based sequence of the rice genome (2005) Nature, 436 (7052), pp. 793-800; Zhao, K., Tung, C.W., Eizenga, G.C., Wright, M.H., Ali, M.L., Price, A.H., Norton, G.J., McCouch, S., Genome-wide association mapping reveals a rich genetic architecture of complex traits in oryza sativa (2011) Nat.

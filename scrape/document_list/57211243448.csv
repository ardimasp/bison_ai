Several web applications offering this type of services have emerged, but they did not come without limitations to certain products and feature availabilities in them. The limitations to individual personal shoppers were raised as the problems that will be discussed in this study. The purpose of this research was to develop an application that can open an opportunity for anyone to become an entrepreneur as well as requester or personal shopper customer. This research involved literature review, comparative analysis of similar applications, application design and evaluation with proportion testing to compare the proportion of users who agreed to those who disagreed with the statements related to the variables evaluated. In addition, an independent test was also performed to find out about the variables related to users' satisfaction with the application. The researchers suggest developing an e-commerce application with an addition of a bidding feature to increase the level of requester-traveler interaction. From the evaluation results, it can be proven that Nitipyuk is useful and easy to use for users. It only needs improvement in the user interface design to better attract users. © 2019 The Authors.

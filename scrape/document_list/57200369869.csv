Many of the current technologies go in the direction of automotive driver assistance features. However, many of the driver assistance features still require physical movement by human to enable the features. In this work, the proposed method is used in order to make certain feature to be functioning without any physical movement, instead human just need to think about it in their mind. In this work, brain signal is recorded and processed in order to be used as input to the recognition system. Right-Left sign lamp based on the brain signal recognition system can potentially replace the button or switch of the specific device in order to make the lamp work. The system then will decide whether the signal is 'Right' or 'Left'. The decision of the Right-Left side of brain signal recognition will be sent to a processing board in order to activate the automotive relay, which will be used to activate the sign lamp. Furthermore, the intelligent system approach is used to develop authorized model based on the brain signal. Particularly Support Vector Machines (SVMs)-based classification system is used in the proposed system to recognize the Left-Right of the brain signal. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent Automatic brain signal-based Right-Left sign lamp access control system. The signal is processed by Linear Prediction Coefficient (LPC) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and the resulting experiment shows the training and testing accuracy of 100% and 80%, respectively. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","brain signal; human factor; Linear Prediction Coding (LPC); Support Vector Machines (SVMs)","Access control; Automobile drivers; Human engineering; Intelligent systems; Signal processing; Speech recognition; Automotive technology; Brain signals; Classification system; Linear prediction coding; Linear prediction coefficients; Recognition systems; Support vector machine (SVMs); Training and testing; Support vector machines",,,,,"9 innovative new car technologies unveiled at CES 2017 (2017) Men's Journal, , http://www.mensjournal.com/gear/collections/9-innovative-new-car-technologies-unveiled-at-ces-2017-w458917/mercedes-benz-w458926, Jim Shi.

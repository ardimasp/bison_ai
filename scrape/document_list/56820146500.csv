The result obtained showed that the variables of BI-Rate, exchange rate and inflation influenced the consumer behaviour variables (credit interest rate and deposit interest rate). Variables such as gross domestic products and liquidity significantly affect the deposit interest rate and the credit interest rate. The deposit value is significantly affected by the deposit interest rate, exchange rate and the gross domestic product while the credit outstanding value is significantly affected by the credit interest rate, liquidity and all macro and monetary economic variables in the models. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Consumer behaviour; Liquidity; Macroeconomics; Monetary policy",,,,,,"The authors wish to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika journal team that help publish this article.","Bansal, R., Coleman, W.

Since its creation, it has significantly contributed to the development and growth of the regional economy with massive growth in the creative industry. It comprises cultural heritage, art, and economic values. Batik Madura is made up of unique colours which are inspired by the nature, culture, and environment of Madura. In recent years, most of the Small Medium Enterprises (SME) businesses carried out by Batik Madura merchants have been facing challenges on how to survive in the current globalization and digital era. Similarly, batik artisans (craftsmen) are decreasing drastically, leading to a decrease in productivity and cultural preservation. The purpose of this research work is to analyze the key factors affecting batik entrepreneurs, to analyze factors affecting their existence and to change their view on the use of social media platforms and information technology to support their businesses. Furthermore, this research work aims at analyzing the ways batik artisans could survive and increase their craftsmanship quality. Data were collected using the quantitative method of data collection which involves the use of questionnaires. The results of the analysis obtained show that the economic growth of Batik Madura is greatly influenced by family and relatives and not by skills. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Batik Artisan; Batik Madura; Digital era; Information technology; Small Medium Enterprise Industry (SME)",,,,,,"The authors wish to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika journal team that help publish this article.","(2017) Batik Madura: Sejarah jati diri dan motif [Batik Madura: History of identity and motives], , Alwiyah.

The data for this study were drawn from a balanced sample of 111 public manufacturing firms listed in the Indonesia Stock Exchange between 2009 and 2013. A Tobit regression analysis with cluster-robust standard errors was then employed to find the effects of firm size, profitability, sales growth, financial leverage, and inter-period on the magnitude of dividend yield. This study finds that firm size, profitability, and sales growth positively influence the magnitude of dividends paid relative to stock prices received by shareholders. On the other hand, it also finds that financial leverage negatively affects dividends.

Therefore, in order to help the company to learn the result of the project budgets that have already been spent for the various needs of project construction, the technology of data warehouse should be present in order to extract and record data more consistently and time-saving. Data warehouse technology to support the development of Data Warehouse is Pentaho because Pentaho is database application that is supported with database MYSQL and OLAP feature as a means to analyze and process data contained in multidimensional tables once the process of ETL is executed. ETL means the process of selecting and extracting data from one source into the designated source in order to produce better-quality data result. OLAP is developed by using pivot 4j view integrated by pentaho server to map the structure of fact and dimension table properly so that, the tables can get a proper connection to display desired information in term of graphs for the need of dashboard display. The dashboard that is coded through mdx queries in CDE Dashboard shows the final result of either monthly or yearly project budget obviously and reliably so that the company can learn the report and make decision that needs to be taken to control the budget costs and maintain the company profit. Both CDE Dashboard and pivot 4j view are integrated with pentaho server. Finally, report is presented by using pentaho report designer as a means to extract needed data more rapidly and consistently because data are called through id stored in different table, but the same field. © BEIESP.","Data warehouse; MYSQL; Pentaho; Realization of project budget CDE dashboard",,,,,,"Alvi, I.A., (2018) Modeling Your Dimensional Data Warehouse: Star Schema Vs.

Voting is also often used in determining something that are very important, such as determining people's representative council. In addition, the current voting is still using the Conventional system that uses paper in balloting, and vote counting. This can cause human error. The technology that is increasingly developing in the current era of globalization is e-voting. From this research, an e-vote system will be developed that applies the concept of the block chain node with smart contract. Smart contracts generate unique code for each new election. So that manipulation of election results will not be possible because each voter has only one account and one address block chain. From the results of the test the author can conclude that the smart contract block chain can be used to prove the results of a safe choice and create e-voting that is honest. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

In running its business, Pegipegi has two platforms for the community to be able to access its services, namely through websites and mobile applications. Data shows that the majority of people access Pegipegi services through mobile applications. For the services offered, Pegipegi has a high rating. However, this cannot make Pegipegi the most visited OTA by the people of Indonesia. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the level of Pegipegi user loyalty is influenced by the user experience (UX) factor. UX measurements in this study were carried out using the user experience questionnaire (UEQ) method. Measurement data using the UEQ method will later be obtained using Microsoft Excel. Based on the measurement results, the results will be associated with indicators of the level of loyalty. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

At the beginning of 2019, the PT.DKB loyalty program changed from a physical membership card to an electronic membership card which support is provided via a website. This study is done to analyze the factors affecting the loyalty of PT.DKB customers with changes in the loyalty program to electronic membership with website-based usage. The factors analyzed in this study are Website Quality, E-Service Quality, Ease of Use, and Perceived Usefulness with the target Customer Loyalty variable. The study was conducted with a total sample of 155 respondents. The analysis is performed by testing validity using Item to Total Pearson Correlation with a correlation level ≥ 0.5, reliability testing using Cronbach's alpha with a minimum value of Cronbach's alpha ≥ 0.6, and hypothesis tests with the condition that a hypothesis is accepted if P-value ≤ 0.05. The test results performed with the SmartPLS application indicate that there are two indicators which correlation level is less than 0.5 both of those indicators are removed from the next step of the test. Reliability tests result in values above 0.6 for all variables. Hypothesis tests performed show that four of the six hypotheses were accepted in this study. The results of this study indicate that the Perceived Usefulness factor directly influences the loyalty of PT.DKB customers and indirectly that the loyalty of PT.DKB customers are influenced by Website Quality and EService Quality. From the results of this study, there are three factors which influenced the customers loyalty of PT.DKB. Those factors are: Website Quality, E-Service Quality, and Perceived Usefulness by increasing the function regarding these factors, PT.DKB could retain and increase their customers loyalty. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Affecting Factors; Customer Loyalty; Electronic Membership; SmartPLS; Website Based Membership",,,,,,"Abu-alhaija, A.

However, very few remain to study the design process or the game model of Game-Based Learning. This paper explains how the framework is implemented to a game best suited for Game-Based Learning in Security Studies classroom. The aim of this study is to define and develop a game best suited for enhancing learning outcomes of National Defense Strategy subject in International Relations Department. The research implements MDA Framework in the development process of the game. The implementation process is done using IT-BluTric framework. IT-BluTric framework lists all processes that needed to be done. After several processes are done, feedbacks from field expert are collected. The questions for the feedbacks are linked to the 4 Key Characteristics of a Learning Game (challenge, curiosity, fantasy, control), which has a deep correlation with MDA Framework. The final result is an assessment of using IT-BluTric framework in developing a Game-Based Learning, along with feedbacks for the game. The conclusions are hoped to give insights on how MDA Framework is implemented in a Game-Based Learning and the whole development process could serve as a reference to other Game-Based Learning applications. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Game engineering; Game-based learning; IT-BluTric framework; MDA framework; Video game",,,,,,"van Eck, R., (2006) Digital Game-Based Learning: It’s Not Just the Digital Natives Who are Restless, , Educause Review, March/April; Prensky, M., Digital Game-Based Learning (2007) Paragon House, St. Paul; Erhel, S., Eric, J., Digital game-based learning: Impact of instructions and feedback on motivation and learning effectiveness (2013) Comput.

This research aims to study several frameworks used to develop games for educational purposes and formulate a framework for the development of game-based learning, specifically for Strategic Studies in International Relations Department, Bina Nusantara University. Literature reviews of previously completed research studied existing frameworks and models, including the Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics (MDA) Framework and the Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation (ADDIE) Model, as well as the First Principles of Learning for designing the content of the game. The result shows the implementation of these frameworks in the design process of the game, as well as the early development of the game presented as a prototype. © 2016 IEEE.","digital game-based learning; game-based learning; international relations; strategic studies; video games)","Bins; Computer games; Curricula; Design; Education; Human computer interaction; Digital game-based learning; Game-based Learning; International relations; Strategic study; Video game; E-learning",,,,,"Van Eck, R., Digital game-based learning: It's not just the digital natives who are restless (2006) Educause Review, , March/April; Asal, V., Playing games with International Relations (2005) International Studies Perspectives, pp. 359-373. , June; Bridge, D., Teaching diplomacy by other means: Using an outside-ofclass simulation to teach International Relations theory (2013) International Studies Perspectives, pp. 1-15; Hatipoglu, E., Muftuler-Bac, M., Murphy, T., Simulation games in teaching International Relations: Insights from a multi-day, multi-stage, multi-issue simulation on Cyprus (2013) International Studies Perspectives, pp. 1-13; Sabin, P., (2012) Simulating War: Studying Conflict Through Simulation Games, , New York: Continuum International Publishing Group; Climate Challenge, , http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/hottopics/climatechange/climate_challenge/, [Accessed 19 October 2016]; Museum, N.A., The Battle of Waterloo Game, , http://waterloo200.org/battle-of-waterloo-game/, [Accessed 19 October 2016]; Southeast Asia Games Market the World's Fastest Growing Region CASUAL GAMES SECTOR REPORT 2015, , Newzoo Games Market Research; Elkus, A., Professor, Tear Down This Wall: Is the Divide between Security Studies and Strategic Studies Permanent?

This paper intended to analyze and evaluate the NGIPS to protect network from penetration system that utilize the weakness from firewall, that is exploitation to HTTP port. By the existence of NGIPS, it is expected can improve the network security, also network administrator could monitor and detect the threats rapidly. Research method includes scenario and topology penetration testing plan. The result of this research is the evaluation of penetration testing that utilizes HTTP port to exploit through malicious domain. The evaluation conducted to ensure the NGIPS system can secure the network environment through penetration testing. This study can be concluded that it can become reference to optimize network security with NGIPS as network security layer. © 2019 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Firewall; Intrusion prevention system; Next generation penetration testing",,,,,,"Fossi, M., Turner, D., Johnson, E., Mack, T., Adams, T., Blackbird, J., (2010) Symantec Internet Security Threat Report-trends for 2009, p.

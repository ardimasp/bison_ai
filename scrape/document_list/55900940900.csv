Findbugs is able to detects many bugs pattern, but some parts are not quite accurately detected. It is called false positives when there is no bugs but the system raised warning. It is called false negatives if there is a bugs but the system didn't raised warning. Here in this paper, with another method, will try to improve false negatives and also false positives. In this paper those 2 variabel will used as measurements. JDBC used as an area of testing because most of JDBC syntax will not seen error unless it executed. This method is needed to handle bugs pattern which is not able to be detected by standard compiler. In this paper will be shown about how bedhigasan will win the false negatives of findbugs and how bedhigasan will loose the false positives of findbugs. Because of the increasing level of awareness of bugs pattern, it decrease the false positives. This application is still need improvement in how mutting some detected bugs. © 2014 SERSC.","Bugs pattern; JDBC; Non-linear code scanning; Static analysis",,,,,,"Shadrach, J., Ford, L.G., Bugs Pattern Detection in JDBC using Static Analysis Non-Linear Method (2013) SERSC; Brian, C., Daniel, H., David, H., Reuven, L., William, P., Kristin, S., Improving Your Software Using Static Analysis to Find Bugs (2006) OOPSLA; Brett, S., (2005) Pro Java Programming, , 2nd, Apress, New York; David, H., William, P., Jaime, S., Evaluating and Tuning a Static Analysis to Find Null Pointer Bugs (2005) PASTE",,,,"Science and Engineering Research Support Society",,,,,17389984,,,,"English","Int.

The analysis will be based on existing best practice in implement JDBC. To analyze JDBC, bugs patterns are needed to be compared with existing best practice. Various methods are available to be used in constructing this kind of application, but in this paper, static analysis non-linear method is used in designing this application. Static analysis means the java program code will be read and analyzed without executing. Non-linear meansthe java program code will not read sequentially, but it will follow the flow of the program code itself. And this application will be called Bedhigasan, which able to detect bugs pattern in implementing JDBC and it will report those bugs to the web page including with location of the bugs ©2013 SERSC.","Bugs pattern; Java; JDBC; Non-linear; Static analysis",,,,,,"Brian, C., Daniel, H., David, H., Reuven, L., Pugh, W., Kristin, S., ""Improving Your Software Using Static Analysis to Find Bugs"" (2006); Jeffrey, F., Michael, H., William, P., ""Improving Software Quality with Static Analysis (2007); David, H., William, P., Finding Bugs is Easy (2004); Brett, S., Pro Java Programming (2005), 2nd, Apress, New York","Jabonir, S.; Departement of Magister Information Technology, , Jakarta, Indonesia; email: shadrach.jabonir@live.com",,,,,,,,17389984,,,,"English","Int.

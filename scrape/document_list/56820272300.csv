IC is an intangible asset that has been acknowledged by various researchers to be the most important asset of a firm and its roles are to shape and integrate tangible assets into value creation processes. In this study, IC was proxied by VAIC and the operating performance was represented by ROA, OPM, and ATO. The sample in this study consists of Indonesian firms in the hospitality industry between the year of 2007 and 2011. This study found out that IC had limited role in driving profitability of a firm. When VAIC was broken down into tangible assets (VACA) and intangible assets (VAHU and STVA), the most dominant which is pushing the profitability of companies is still tangible assets. VACA is even comparable with size and leverage in getting firms profitable. Human capital (VAHU) is the weakest link in value creation of the firms at the hospitality industry in Indonesia. Finally, structural capital (STVA) increases productivity only through reduction of the costs in doing businesses not in revenue increases. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

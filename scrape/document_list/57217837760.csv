It is an electronic certificate that is used for traditional boat and fishing vessel of less than 7 gross tonnage. This electronic certificate is for the first time being applied to a ship in Indonesia. This marks a new era for ship certification in Indonesia. The conventional paper format of certification had been applied before it was changed to electronic certification. Indonesia is implementing electronic certificates on traditional vessels and fishing vessels of less than 7 gross tonnage due to several reasons. The first is the need for durable form material due to lifetime validation of certificates. The second due to problems related to misuse of previous type of conventional paper format certificates that caused difficulties in determining the number of this type of vessels in Indonesia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Fisheries; Ships; Electronic certification; Indonesia; Paper formats; Safe operation; Sea transportation; Fishing vessels",,,,,"Maritime Organization, I., (2016) Guidelines for the Use of Electronic Certificates; Direktur Jenderal Perhubungan Laut, , Surat Edaran No. SE.87/PK/DK/2019 Penerapan Pas Kecil Elektronik Sebagai Pengganti Pas Kecil Untuk Kapal Dengan Ukuran Tonase Kotor Kurang Dari GT.7 Pada Kantor Kesyahbandaran Dan Otoritas Pelabuhan Kelas IV Muara Angke; Ferrell, O., Harline, M., (2005) Marketing Strategy; Bickerstaff, K., Tolley, R., Walker, G., Transport planning and participation: The rhetoric and realities of public involvement (2002) J.

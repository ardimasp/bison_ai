This study focuses in to renew the application and evaluate the updated application for visually impaired children developed by utility Unity software. Besides, standards of good gamification are worthy of study and can increase the motivation to learn, and it only can happen if it meets the needs of the user. To achieve those goals, it has completed some development on several sections includes the homepage, input text, text size, and scoring. In this paper, System Usability Scale (SUS) is utilized, and some statistical model is conducted such as average, mean, Pearson-Product Moment correlation, T-test, and ANOVA. T-test results show that no difference between the partial and fully visually impaired participant, gender, and participants who used a similar application and not. The grades do not affect the SUS score, so it proved that the collected SUS score as average 75 is an objective result from the users although the average grade is 46. Moreover, both variable usability (0.884) and variable learnability (0.771) are positively correlated toward the System Usability Scale, notwithstanding variable usability and variable learnability is not correlated (0.383). The impact of this research can improve the industries especially the education field in Indonesia and some expectations from that result are included experience, knowledge, and skills of the users that need to be evaluated in further research. Hence, in the future, by using this application, we can increase the standard of living visually impaired people and enhance industry 4.0 in Indonesia. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Income smoothing is one of earnings management methods by reducing fluctuations in earnings to make it look stable, because relatively stable earnings are preferred by investors. This study examines the debt to equity variable and the size of the company which according to previous studies have different results between one researcher with another related to the effect on income smoothing. Debt to equity is measured using a comparison of total debt with total capital and company size is measured using total assets. This study uses empirical data from the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) with a sample of 16 companies from the property and real estate sector selected from 46 companies. The analytical method used is the t test for two free samples and multiple linear regression. The results showed that the debt to equity variable and company size did not have a significant difference between the income grading company and the non-income grading company so that the two variables could not be used as indicators that were associated with the actions of companies that did income smoothing. In addition, based on the results of the study also found that the variable debt to equity and company size do not have a significant effect on income smoothing practices. © 2019 by Advance Scientific Research.

In recent years, an increasing number of Indonesia students are turning their interest to study in Taiwan. However, Chinese education in Indonesia is fundamentally based on studies of Mainland China, therefore lacking opportunities for students to understand profoundly Taiwan's language and culture. Furthermore, there is a lack of opportunities for students to understand game design power and industry in Taiwan. The purpose of this on-going program (2014-recent) is to enhance the understanding of game and animation design education in Taiwan, through exchanges with students in Indonesia. It aims to promote exchanges between the faculty and students at the universities with faculties, lecturers and artists in Taiwan for collaborative work, especially in game art design, game engine and animation. It sincerely hopes that students could understand profoundly Taiwan's language and culture by game and animation online tutorials, and provide opportunities for students to understand game design power and industry in Taiwan, Indonesia, and worldwide market. After a year of implementing the four points mentioned in this article, we have already observed some evident outcome. The biggest achievement comes from the workshop which has received significant responses and an increasing number of attendances from both Taiwan and Indonesia. In the near future, it hopes that we can hold a public event such as lecture, workshop and exhibition to raise awareness of and develop an affinity with Taiwanese langue and culture among the general public using the design thinking approach for computational creativity, such as co-design Taiwan language on-line course or game-based learning. © 2019 IEEE.","Computational Creativity; Design Thinking; Game and Animation; International Exchanges","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Curricula; Engineering education; Exhibitions; Human computer interaction; Students; Animation designs; Asia Pacific region; Chinese educations; Collaborative Work; Computational creativities; Game-based Learning; International exchange; Online tutorials; Animation",,,,"Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia, KPM","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This programme was supported financially by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan.

In this case, because of the need for the world of education and coupled with most Japanese people not wanting to use languages other than the original language, Japanese language is now a very important language. On the other hand it is also seen from a person's language skills, based on the results of a survey of 100 international students who continued their studies in Japan, 81 said Japanese was difficult to understand, because the letters were different from ordinary alphabet letters. Therefore we need a new learning model to attract interest and improve one's Japanese language skills. The model was adopted into the game, by using games it is expected that players can understand the letters hiragana and katakana. The game-making method uses a modified game development life cycle so that game creation can be done maximally and flexibly. Then, by adopting the concept of shodo it can produce proportional writing. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The optimal of solving clustering problem occurs when the data joins in one group which has a similar category. This study combines Adaptive Genetic Algorithm, K-Means and Greedy Selection to solve clustering problem, named RAGKA. In first step, the centroid is determined by K-Means. Crossover and mutation are performed based on the fitness value of each centroid. At last, the greedy search is operated to get the better solution. To show the performance of RAGKA, five data sets of clustering problem are used. Moreover, RAGKA is compared with other methods as well. The result shows that RAGKA is successfully to solve cluster problem and outperforms than the others. © 2016 IEEE.","Adaptive Genetic Algorithm; Clustering; Greedy Selection Introduction; K-Means","Genetic algorithms; Problem solving; Adaptive genetic algorithms; Clustering; Clustering problems; Crossover and mutation; Genetic K-means algorithm; Greedy selections; K-means; Robust adaptive; Clustering algorithms",,,,,,"Guliani, S., (2015) An Enhanced Clustering Algorithm by Comparative Study on K-Means Algorithm, 4 (6), pp. 193-196. , http://dx.doi.org/10.17577/IJERTV4IS060271; Karaboga, D., Ozturk, C., A novel clustering approach: Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) (2011) Algorithm, 11, pp. 652-657. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2009.12.025; Subbalakshmi, C., Rao, P.V., Mohan, S.K., (2014) Performance Issues on K-Mean Partitioning Clustering Algorithm, pp. 41-51; Vora, P., Oza, B., (2013) A Survey on K-mean Clustering and ParticleSwarm Optimization, (3), pp. 24-26; Zhang, C., Ouyang, D., Ning, J., An artificial bee colony approach for clustering (2010) Expert Systems with Applications, 37 (7), pp. 4761-4767. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2009.11.003; Cole, R.M., (1998) Clustering with Genetic Algorithms, , University of Western Australia; Zalik, K.R., (2008) An Efficient K-means Clustering Algorithm, 29, pp. 1385-1391. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.patrec.2008.02.014; Shelokar, P.S., Jayaraman, V.K., Kulkarni, B.D., (2004) An ant colony approach for clustering, 509, pp. 187-195. , (December 2003); Zhao, B.J., An ant colony clustering algorithm (2007) Machine Learning and Cybernetics, 2007 International Conference on, 7, pp. 3933-3938. , August.

The process of applying gamification is included understanding the target audience and the context, defining learning objectives, structuring the experience, identify resources, and applying gamification elements. Some typing applications for visually impaired people are consuming braille, touchscreen, and delivered in English. As for some educational-based gamified applications have not supported typing for the blind children especially in Indonesia. Therefore, in this contribution, a novel gamified application for typing is presented. Moreover, this application is delivered in Indonesian language. As a material for typing, this application consumes questions based on the curriculum applied in Indonesia. This model is developed with utilized the Game Development Life Circle (GDLC) method which includes initialization, pre-production, production, testing, and release. The application has been tested on several respondents. The respondents believe that this application is valuable, easy to use, and easy to understand. © 2017 The Authors.

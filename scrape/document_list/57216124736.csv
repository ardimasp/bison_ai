This study used these algorithms to obtain the root cause of delay. The calculation of information gain shows that most influence variables for the classification process of delay are warehouse capacity and quote order lead time. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Data Mining; Decision Tree Analysis; Lead Time; Order Fulfillment","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Algorithm approaches; Classification process; Decision tree analysis; Leadtime; Order fulfillment; Ordering lead time; Problem identification; Warehouse capacity; Data mining",,,,,"Paper Network, E., (2018) The State of the Global Paper Industry; (2018) Analisis Perkembangan Industri; Kotler, P., Keller, K.L., (2012) Marketing Management; Croxton, K.L., The Order Fulfillment Process (2003) Int.

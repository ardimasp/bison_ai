In order to satisfy this requirement, many active queuing algorithms are offered, such as RED, BLUE, and controlled delay (CoDel). The number of publications aimed at evaluating the performance of the active queue management (AQM) algorithm is still limited by using a network simulator and only comparing two algorithms. The combination of AQM and connection types (fairness and no-fairness) in real network implementation has not been discussed much. In this paper, we offer a comparison of the performance of three queuing algorithms, namely DropTail, BLUE, and CoDel, with two types of connections, namely fairness and no-fairness using real network devices and internet video streaming access. Experiments carried out in the real network environment using Sandvine PL8840's bandwidth management device. The quality of services (QoS) parameters that will be compared are throughput, latency, and packet loss. The comparison results show that fairness connections on all queuing algorithms can maintain low latency values; throughput is smaller than no-fairness connections. The absence of packet loss in streaming video based on the TCP protocol does not guarantee that the video being played runs well because it depends on the available bandwidth capacity. © 2020 IEEE.","AQM; BLUE; CoDel; Droptail; QoS; RED","Bandwidth; Information management; Packet loss; Queueing networks; Video on demand; Video streaming; Active queue management algorithms; Available bandwidth; Bandwidth management; Comparison result; Network simulators; Queuing algorithms; Real-time internet; Video-on-demand applications; Queueing theory",,,,"Binus University","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The publication of this research work is supported by Bina Nusantara University.","Arsan, T., Bandwidth allocation and traffic shaping in mobile broadband networks using deep packet inspection (2016) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, 14 (8), pp. 1066-1074; (2018) Comparing Traffic Policing and Traffic Shaping for Bandwidth Limiting, , https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/quality-of-serviceqos/qos-policing/19645-policevsshape.pdf, October; Flach, T., Papageorge, P., Terzis, A., Pedrosa, L., Cheng, Y., Karim, T., Govindan, R., An internet-wide analysis of traffic policing (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on ACM SIGCOMM 2016 Conference-SIGCOMM '16, pp. 468-482. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2934872.2934873; Innocentkechukwu, U., A survey on bandwidth management techniques via the osi model network and application layers (2017) Global Journal of Computer Science and Technology, , https://computerresearch.org/index.php/computer/article/view/1650; Karimah, S.A., Putrada, A.G., Rianda, F., Performansi algoritma proportional integral controlled enhanced (pie) dan droptail pada layanan voip (2019) Indonesia Journal on Computing, 4, pp. 119-132; Li, M., Wang, H., Science, C., Study of Active Queue Management Algorithms; Maratsolas, K.P.E., Video activity-based traffic policing: A new paradigm (2014) IEEE Transaction on Multimedia., 16, pp. 1446-1459; Mohammed, H., Attiya, G., El-Dolil, S., Active queue management for congestion control: Performance evaluation, new approach, and comparative study (2017) International Journal of Computing and Network Technology, 5 (2), pp. 37-49. , http://dx.doi.org/10.12785/IJCNT/050201; Mohammed, S.B.A., Dajab, D.D., Mu'Zu, M.B., Policy creation model for policy based bandwidth management in the core network (a case study of abu data network) (2013) International Journal of Computer Application, 68, pp. 1-6; Singh, G., Nagar, Y., Comparing different active queue management techniques (2015) International Journal of Emerging Research in Management &Technology, 4 (5), pp. 50-56; Solomon, T., Zungeru, A.M., Selvaraj, R., Mangwala, M., A packet distribution traffic model for industrial application: A case of biust network (2017) Internation Journal of Information and Electronics Engineering., 7, pp. 136-140; Solomon, T., Zungeru, Selvaraj, R.A.M., Phakedi, Olefile, Bagwasi, O., Policy-based network management in biust network (2017) American Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences, 10 (3), pp. 661-668; Thato Solomon, A.M., A packet distribution traffic model for industrial application: A case of biust network (2017) International Journal of Information and Electronics Engineering, pp. 136-140; Vimaladevi, B., Manju, Optimizing of video streaming through bufferbload mitigation using hybrid fq-codel algorithm (2016) International Journal of Computer Applications, 142, pp. 33-36; Zhang, W., Ye, S., Li, B., Zhao, H., Zheng, Q., A priority-based adaptive scheme for multi-view live streaming over http (2016) Computer Communications, 85, pp. 89-97. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comcom.2016.04.001; Wairisal, M., Surantha, N., Design and evaluation of efficient bandwidth management for a corporate network (2018) 2018 International Conference on Information Management and Technology (ICIMTech), pp. 98-102. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIMTech.2018.8528162",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","5th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2020","13 August 2020 through 14 August 2020",,163671,,9781728170718,,,"English","Proc.

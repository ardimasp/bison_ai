PT GDA adopts innovations and technology that are currently developing as new knowledge and developed into products and services. Knowledge in this company is a major asset that drives to be more innovative and improve the competitiveness of companies in business as a provider of optimal and leading technology solutions. Knowledge management (KM) is a concept that is needed to manage and make explicit knowledge. PT GDA requires a Knowledge Management System (KMS) as an information system that can be applied to support KM processes and mechanisms with the support of human resources, technology and tools. The implementation of this system is to avoid the risk of ignorance and loss of knowledge in organizations with the movement of human resources. This paper compares and reviews Knowledge Management Success Factors (KMCSFs) from previous studies so that it became KMCSFs in accordance with PT GDA. This paper aims to analyze the readiness of KMS implementation in this company by analyzing the data obtained through a questionnaire. Descriptive statistic resulted in an average value for each aspect, namely people, process, and technology and the mean score of all aspects to determine the level of readiness. © IAEME Publication.","Information Technology; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Management System; Readiness; Success Factors",,,,,,"Gratton, L., Ghoshal, S., Managing personal human capital: New ethos for the ‘volunteer’ employee (2003) European Management Journal, 21 (1), pp. 1-10; Davenport, T., Prusak, L., (2000) Working Knowledge: How Organizations Manage What They Know, , Harvard Business Scholl Press, Boston; Bhatt, D., (2000) EFQM Excellence Model and Knowledge Management Implications, , http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.573.6798&rep=rep1&type=pdf; Alavi, M., Leidner, D., Knowledge management and knowledge management systems:Conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Quarterly, 25 (1), pp. 107-136; Skyrme, D., Amidon, D., The knowledge agenda (1997) Journal of Knowledge Management, 1 (1), pp. 27-37; Davenport, T.H., De Long, D.W., Beers, M.C., Successful knowledge management projects (1998) Sloan Management Review, 39 (2), pp. 43-57; Liebowitz, J., Key ingredients to the success of an organization’s knowledge management strategy (1999) Knowledge and Process Management, 6 (1), pp. 37-40; Becerra-Fernandez, I., Sabherwal, R., (2015) Knowledge Management: Systems and Processes, , 2nd ed.).

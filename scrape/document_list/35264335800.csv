In exploring these factors, referring to the dual factor concept, this study enhances previous studies by integrating consumer intentions to adopt and resistance to adopt innovation in a research model. The research model was tested empirically using structural equation modeling (SEM) on data collected from 300 people targeting the market for NFC-based mobile payment products in Indonesia. Indonesia, which has the world’s fourth-largest population, the second largest number of cash transactions in the world, and cellular phone penetration rates and unbanked bankable numbers that are still very high, is a promising market share for NFC-based mobile payment. Amid these conditions, the rate of adoption of NFC-based mobile payments in Indonesia is not yet satisfactory. From the results of empirical testing it is known that the behavior in adopting NFC-based mobile payment is influenced by consumers’ intention to adopt, and resistance to adopt innovation. In addition to influencing innovation adoption behavior, consumer resistance to adopt innovation also influences consumer intentions to adopt the innovation. The consumer had perceptions that NFC-based mobile payment has advantages over existing innovations, by lifestyle and needs and are easy to use also need to be considered because it is proven to affect consumer intention to adopt NFC-based mobile payment. © IJSTR 2020.","Adoption of innovation behavior; Consumer intention to adopt innovation; Consumer resistance to adopt innovation; Dual factor concept; NFC-based mobile payment",,,,,,"Al-Majali, M., Mat, N.K.N., Modelling the antecedents of internet banking service adoption (IBSA) in Jordan: A structural equation modeling (SEM) approach (2011) J.

In addition, a decrease in sales prices due to competition causes the level of profitability to fall. This condition is thought to be related to problems in collaboration strategies and market attractiveness. So based on this background, this study aims to examine the effect of market attractiveness and collaboration strategies on the business performance of the digital OOH media industry in Indonesia. The type of research used in this study is verification. The unit of analysis and unit of observation in this study is the management of the company's business units which are included in the digital OOH media industry in Indonesia. The research data collected is in the time horizon that is cross-sectional / one shoot. This study uses a multivariate statistics analysis method using PLS. The study population amounted to 183, the sample was taken as many as 118 using simple random sampling which was distributed to 3 major cities namely Jakarta, Surabaya, and Bandung, based on a list of members of the population in each city as a sampling frame. The results of the study show that market attractiveness and collaboration strategies influence business performance. Collaboration strategies have a greater influence than market attractiveness in ac hieving business performance. The results of this study have implications for the management of digital OOH media industry companies that improving business performance rests on a collaboration strategy that is supported by adaptation to market attractiveness. © IJSTR 2019.","Business performance; Collaboration strategy; Digital out of home (OOH) media; Market attractiveness",,,,,,"Best, R.J., (2009) Market-Based Management Strategies for Growing., , Customer Value and Profitability Fifth Edition.

Innovation is a key word in the telecommunications industry, where technology development can change market demand and change the habits of telecommunication service users. We focus on innovation work behavior as an antecedent of job satisfaction. Based on personal/ individual factor and environmental factor, we propose two determinants of innovative work behavior that help us to understand how self-efficacy and employee friendly workplace can evolve to facilitate job satisfaction outcomes. We propose that self-efficacy and employee friendly workplace positively affect job satisfaction by creating an innovative work behavior. A 245-employee sample is used to analyze the theoretical model variables’ relationship to innovative work behavior that can change its values to create job satisfaction. The results support the theoretical model, and lead to some implications for the management practice. © BEIESP.","Employee Friendly Workplace; Human Resource Management; Innovative Work Behavior; Self-Efficacy; Strategic Management",,,,,,"Abstein, A., Heidenreich, S., Spieth, P., Innovative work behaviour: The impact of comprehensive HR system perceptions and the role of work-life conflict (2014) Ind.

It has transformed itself into not just a platform for social interactions, but into a powerful marketing tool. People posting pictures or information through social media will likely influence others seeing it. This research investigates the impact of social media postings on millennial (Gen Y) tourists’ decision in choosing destinations, as well as the perceptions of social media users toward the information they gather from the social media about the tourism destinations. World Travel and Tourism Council in its release in 2018 revealed that tourism industry represents 10.4% of total global GDP. The industry has also contributed 20% of new jobs globally created in the last decade.

Humans can sacrifice anything for health. Health needs to be supported by government facilities, one of which is a hospital. The development of hospitals in Indonesia is increasingly rapid. The availability of more hospitals needs to be supported by the resources available in the hospital. The problem that occurs at this time is that there are still many patients who complain about the lack of availability of resources both in terms of doctors, beds that must be included in the waiting schedule, medical technicians who sometimes queue up for blood collection, administrative processes that take a long time so patients are not immediately treated so on. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine the influence of resources (building area, general practitioners, specialist doctors, nurses, pharmacists, medical technicians, health workers, and non-health workers) on patients (outpatient, inpatient, and emergency room) ) in Indonesian hospitals. The method used is multiple regression with the help of SPSS 20. While the data taken is the population of all hospitals in Indonesia. The results obtained are three, first, building area, bed and medical conditions affect inpatient. Both general practitioners, medical technicians, health workers and non-health workers influence outpatients. Finally, beds, general practitioners, medical specialists, medical technicians, and health workers influence ED patients. Based on the results of these studies it can be suggested that the main focus for each type of patient needs to be considered especially those that have a significant effect. © 2019 iJOE.","Hospital; Patients; Regression; Resources",,,,,,"Hn, S., (2015) Peranan Sektor Kesehatan dalam Pembangunan, , www.ajarekonomi.com:https://www.ajarekonomi.com/2015/12/kesehatan-sebagai-investasi-pembangunan.html, 12 17; Syukro, R., (2017) Ekonomi.

Using quantitative method, the population of this research are online customers in Indonesia, with non-probability sampling that will be done by purposive sampling method based on predetermined criterias, which are customers who were doing transactions in the Business to Consumer (B2C) online sites, experienced service failure in the last 6 months, submitted a complaint, and received a response. Sample of 317 online customers were gathered and analyzed using the Structural Equation Modeling. The results of this study indicated that 5 hypothesis are supported with data. As a conclusion, informational justice and post-recovery satisfaction has positive effect, while service failure severity acts as a moderator between post-recovery satisfaction and behavioral intentions. As a managerial implication, online store management needs to ensure the informational justice to make a post-recovery satisfaction. Therefore, online store management needs to ensure the informational justice to make a post-recovery satisfaction, increase repurchase and positive e-word of mouth intention, also work harder to recover services, especially in high service failure severity condition. © 2019, Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business.","Behavioral intentions; Informational justice; Post-recovery satisfaction; Service failure severity",,,,,,"Ajzen, I., From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior (1985) Action Control, pp. 11-39. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-69746-3_2; Anaza, N.A., Personality antecedents of customer citizenship behaviors in online shopping situations (2014) Psychology and Marketing, 31 (4), pp. 251-263. , https://doi.org/10.1002/mar.20692; Anderson, E.W., Mittal, V., Strengthening the satisfaction-profit chain (2000) Journal of Service Research, 3 (2), pp. 107-120. , https://doi.org/10.1177/109467050032001; Andreassen, T.W., Antecedents to satisfaction with service recovery (2000) European Journal of Marketing, 34 (1-2), pp. 156-175. , https://doi.org/10.1108/03090560010306269; Balaji, M.S., Sarkar, A., Does successful recovery mitigate failure severity?

There are limited previous empiric researches studied on the effect of social technology adoption towards ambidexterity. We hypothesize that social technology adoption can lead to ambidexterity directly and through rapid absorptive capacity and collectivism-based collaboration. Using quantitative method, this research was conducted to organizations that adopt social technology in various sectors in Indonesia. Data was processed by structural equation modeling (SEM). This research shows that ambidexterity positively affects organizational performance. It also shows that social technology adoption positively affects ambidexterity directly and through rapid absorptive capacity. However, this research does not support the hypothesis that social technology adoption will positively affect ambidexterity through collectivism-based collaboration. This research may give benefits to strategic management literature in finding the robust model to build an ambidextrous organization, especially through social technology adoption. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Absorptive capacity; Organizational ambidexterity; Organizational performance; Social technology",,,,,,"Andriopoulos, C., Lewis, M.W., Exploitation-exploration tensions and organizational ambidexterity: managing paradoxes of innovation (2009) Organization Science, 20 (4), pp. 696-717; Ashurst, C., Freer, A., Ekdahl, J., Gibbons, C., Exploring IT-enabled innovation: a new paradigm?

New entrants could bring new innovations with cheaper, simple and efficient technology. This phenomenon referred to as Disruptive Innovation. Then the incumbents have to find new ways to stay competitive. The study is conducted by cross sectional quantitative method. The unit of analysis is telecommunication firm in Indonesia with management of these firms as the observation unit. The sampe taken from the population is as many as 100 respondents from Senior Leader in Indonesia telecommunication firm. The analytical approach and the solution technique that is used as the analysis tool in this research is Partial Least Square (PLS). The result of hypothesis testing shows that DC, IC, and AC affects sustainable competitive advantage (SCA) of Indonesia's incumbent telecommunication firm in digital disruption era, where IC has more dominant influence than AC and DC in increasing SCA. This research has implications for both the management of telecommunication firm in Indonesia in maintaining and improving sustainable competitive advantage in the digital disruption era, as well as the contribution to science and further research. © IEOM Society International.","Alliances capability; Digital disruption; Dynamic capability; Innovation capability; Sustainable competitive advantage",,,,,,"Adner, R., Kapoor, R., Value Creation in Innovation Ecosystems: How The Structure of Technological Interdependence Affects Firm Performance in New Technology Generations (2010) Strategic Management Journal, pp. 306-333; Ambrosini, V., Bowman, C., What are dynamic capabilities and are they a useful construct in strategic management?

Despite the prevalence of these programs, there is only a limited amount of research that focuses on the stage before program implementation. The main purpose of this study is to formulate a theory of designing ex ante competitive loyalty programs, and subsequently to provide supporting empirical evidence. The author argues that loyalty programs could be classified into two types: monetary-based rewards and special treatment-based rewards. The author proposes a theory that posits that customer perceptions of the utility of loyalty programs differ between the two types of reward, and are contingent upon the relationship between the customer and the firm. Programs that are perceived favorably by customers will in turn create stronger attitudinal loyalty and higher customer profitability. Using settings of airline passengers and bank customers, the results of the research produce findings that monetary rewards are perceived to provide higher utility perceptions of customers in contractual relationships as compared to non-contractual relationships. However, this research failed to provide empirical support that special treatment rewards are perceived to provide higher utility perceptions of customers in non-contractual relationships compared to contractual ones. The research also models consumer switching using the Markov Chain, and reveals that higher program utility perception is associated with higher attitudinal loyalty, thereby increasing customer equity. Firms are encouraged to incorporate affective elements into their loyalty programs, additional to monetary elements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,09673237,,,,"English","J. Target. Meas. Anal.

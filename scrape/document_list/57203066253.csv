Mobile applications nowadays have created tremendously compared with the website. Usability issues will be questioning as a measurement of mobile application accepted in the market. This paper reports on the systematic literature review (SLR) from 2010 up to 2020 to investigate how usability evaluation of mobile applications will change along the time through the evaluation of mobile devices. From 168 paper retrieved, 32 papers are selected to find the relevance of the research question. The result shows several famous indicators of usability evaluation, which are effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction. There are new inclusions that come as new indicators such as error, learnability, memorability, simplicity, and cognitive load. This result indicates the need for future research especially for new rapid applications created © 2020 IEEE.","Application; Device; Evaluation; Mobile; Usability","Information management; Usability engineering; Cognitive loads; Growth technologies; Mobile applications; Research questions; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Usability evaluation; User satisfaction; Mobile computing",,,,,"Cole, J.S., Bergin, D.A., Whittaker, T.A., Predicting student achievement for low stakes tests with effort and task value (2008) Contemp.

This alternative offers you online learning interactions through synchronous and asynchronous session, which usually accommodated by learning management systems or another technology platform and applications. Basically, in online learning environment, the learning interaction will have a transition from teacher-dependent to learner-dependent, but it still can't be concluded that the succession in online learning doesn't affected by the teaching styles of the instructor. This study is aimed to see whether the teaching styles of the instructors will have an impact in academic achievement of the students. The study was conducted by a comparative study towards two classes with two different instructors, which have their own teaching styles. The result said that the class with the more active and responsive instructors has a better results in score. © 2017 IEEE.","academic achievement; learning interaction; online learning; teaching styles","Computer aided instruction; Information management; Online systems; Teaching; Academic achievements; Comparative studies; Learning interactions; Learning management system; Online learning; Online learning environment; Teaching styles; Technology platforms; E-learning",,,,,"Kurniali, S., An approach to online learning using learning management system in higher education institution (2014) J.

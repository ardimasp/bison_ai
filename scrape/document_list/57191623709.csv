In the process, the utilization of ICT in language teaching has not comprehensively embraced for the level of digital literacies and the different context of universities. This research aims to explore the level of digital literacies at the universities and distinct context of General English (GE) teaching in two private universities in Jakarta. In this frame, the research describes the category of ICT implemented and the relevant aspects of the lecturers in both universities to teach General English. In supporting this, a triangular method of data collection is applied in the research. Technically, a questionnaire consisting of closed and open questions was distributed to lecturers from both universities. The data is analyzed qualitatively based on percentages indicator. The result revealed that the respondents have a good level of digital literacy. However, they lacked some knowledge and skills in managing the classes in an online platform. As a result, the research contributes to providing training to support them in coping with the need for teaching GE with accepted digital literacy. © 2019 ACM.","Digital; ELT; ICT; Lecturers; Literacy","Artificial intelligence; Data collection; Digital; Digital literacies; Higher education; Jakarta; Lecturers; Literacy; Online platforms; Teaching",,,,"Binus University","Thank you to the Bina Nusantara University for the supported grant.","Toro, U., Joshi, M., Ict in higher education: Review of literature from the period 2004-2011 (2012) International Journal of Innovation, Management and Technology, 3 (1), pp. 20-23; Shelomovska, O., Sorokina, L., Romaniukha, M., Bohomaz, K., Nakaznyi, M., (2016) ICT-Competence of University Teachers in Professional Development and Scientific Activity; Habib, H., Ghulam, B., Role of ict in higher education (2017) International Journal of Creative Research Thoughts (IJCRT), 5 (4); Jamwal, A., Shekhar, C., Alam, S., Religious commitment and paranormal beliefs across gender and educational stream (2016) The International Journal of Indian Psychology, 3 (3), p. 129; Adeoye, Y.M., Oluwole, A.F., Blessing, L.A., Appraising the role of information communication technology (ict) as a change agent for higher education in Nigeria (2013) International Journal of Educational Administration and Policy Studies, 5 (8), pp. 177-183; Agrawal, A.K., Mittal, G.K., The role of ict in higher education for the 21st century: Ict as a change agent for education (2018) Multidisciplinary Higher Education, Research, Dynamics & Concepts: Opportunities & Challenges for Sustainable Development, 1 (1), pp. 76-83; Kern, R., (2000) Literacy and Language Teaching, , Oxford University Press; Hafner, C.A., Chik, A., Jones, R., (2015) Digital Literacies and Language Learning; Heitin, L., (2016) What Is Digital Literacy, , https://www.edweek.org, Education Week.

Presumably, a demand emerges in assessing students’ achievement by using technology. In language teaching learning, it is undeniable that the technology is also applied in assessing students’ language skills including writing. In assessing writing, in a common type, the process is carried out manually or typed in a word document. Based on the results, this research aims to explain the development of an integrated multimedia website for assessing writing and the potential of using the website for writing test. Questionnaires were distributed to 28 students joining English Professional Course at BINUS Online Learning to evaluate the promptness of the website for the test and the students’ sense of the website functionality. The result denoted that the website contribution is well-equipped to use as a tool and to test the writing skill. Moreover, the users were comfortable to exert it for undertaking the writing test. Equally important, the developments on the website require continuous improvement, especially for the variation of the questions including to add video and audio integration eventually. © 2018 ACM.","ESL; Integrated-multimedia; Technology; Website; Writing test","E-learning; Surveys; Teaching; Websites; Continuous improvements; High technology; Integrated-multimedia; Language teachings; Online learning; Teaching-learning; Word documents; Writing skills; Students",,,,"Binus University","The study is supported by BINUS University Grant.","Yunus, M., The use of information and communication technology (ict) in teaching esl writing skills (2013) English Language Teaching, 6 (7). , http://edtech2.boisestate.edu/williamstewart287/512/module5/assets/TheUseOfICTInTeachingWritingYunusetal2013.pdf, 2013.

There are several criteria of good writing, two of them are cohesion and coherence. Research of cohesion and coherence writing has been conducted by using Centering Theory and Entity Transition Value method. However, the result can still be improved. Therefore, in this research, we tried to use Thematic Development approach which focused on the use of Theme and Rheme as a method to analyze coherence level of a paragraph, combined with CogNIAC rules and Centering Theory to analyze its cohesion. Besides improving the result of previous methods, this research aims to help users in evaluating and assessing their writing text. To achieve these objectives, the proposed method is compared to previous works as well as human judge. Based on the experiment, the proposed method yields average result of 91% which is nearly equivalent to human judge which is 92%. Thematic Development also yields better result compared to Centering Theory which is 29% and Entity Transition Value which is 0%, given the same data set of beginner and intermediate simple writing. © 2016 IEEE.","coherence; cohesion; english paragraph; thematic development","Coherent light; Centering theories; cohesion; Data set; Development approach; english paragraph; thematic development; Transition values; Adhesion",,,,,,"Rustipa, K., Theme-rheme organization of learners' texts (2010) Dinamika Bahasa Dan Ilmu Budaya, 4 (2); Mitkov, R., Clark, A., Fox, C., Lappin, S., Discourse Processing (2010) The Handbook of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing, pp. 599-611. , West Sussex: Wlley-Blackwell; Not, E., (1996) Implementation of the Thematic Progression and Realization Component, pp. 09-062. , LRE Project; Miltsakaki, E., Kukich, K., Evaluation of text coherence for electronic essay scoring (2004) Natural Language Engineering, 10, p. 44; Tofiloski, M., (2009) Extending Centering Theory for the Measure of Entity Coherence, , Canadian AI.

In recent years, firms in almost all industries have conducted several initiatives to obtain benefits from digitalization. The organizations decide to perform digital transformation and move from the traditional approach to the agile approach for anticipating the rapid changes in the current digital era. This research will investigate the impact of digital transformation to the IT governance mechanism in established company using study case methodology. We analyse two companies in Indonesia: banking and telecommunication companies that have adopted agile and DevOps team. For this purpose, a qualitative study using Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and in-depth interview method were conducted. Our findings show that digital transformation brings many challenges in the established organization. This transformation impacted key elements of IT governance: structure, process, and relational mechanism. IT managers can benefit from this research as guidelines to implement IT Digital Framework in the transition of digital transformation phase. © 2020 IJSTR.","Agile; DevOps; Digital transformation; IT Digital Governance; IT Governance",,,,,,"Spohrer, J.C., Welser, J.J., ""Digital Innovation and Strategic Transformation,"" no (2016) December, 2020; Amorim, M., Mel, N., Digital Transformation: A Literature Review and Guidelines for Future Research, 1, pp. 411-421; Sommer, A.F., Dukovska-Popovska, I., Steger-Jensen, K., Agile Product Development Governance – On Governing the Emerging Scrum (2014) Stage-Gate Hybrids,"", pp. 184-191; Wiedemann, ""IT Governance Mechanisms for DevOps Teams – How Incumbent Companies Achieve Competitive Advantages,"" vol (2018); van Grembergen, W., Queiroz, M., Coltman, T., Tallon, P., (2018) Introduction to the Minitrack on IT Governance and Its Mechanisms, 9, pp. 4877-4879; Qumer, A., (2007) Defining an Integrated Agile Governance for Large 2 IT Governance: a Systematic Review and Analysis, pp. 157-160; Ismail, M.H., Khater, M., Zaki, M., (2017) ""Digital Business Transformation and Strategy: What Do We Know So Far?,"" No, , November; Fitzgerald, M., Kruschwitz, M., Bonnet, N., Welch, D., Embracing Digital Technology: A New Strategic Imperative.

Digital disruption has changed the way peoples do business and perform transactions. However, the bankers still found many problems when performing DB transformation. Main issues on DB transformation are that many banks still assume that digital transformation is about workflows and systems rather than focus on customer experience. Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data Analytics (BDA) have risen and played as an important role in the new banking era. The recent trend of AI and BDA enable banking to be more customer-centric based on data driven. Personalization service becoming an important strategy for leveraging the existing customer engagement, and attracting potential customer become new customers. This study explores the application of AI and BDA in banking for leveraging customer experience. This study used literature review and interviews to gather the data. We interview more than some persons in Indonesia banking industry to get the insight on the implementation of AI and BDA in Indonesia. The paper reveals best practices of the global banking and Indonesian banking, in the implementation of AI & BDA. The contributions of this study are proposed enterprise architecture and recommended digital innovation in AI and BDA that enables banking institutions to leverage customer experiences. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Big Data Analytics; Digital Banking Transformation","Advanced Analytics; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data Analytics; Sales; Banking institutions; Customer experience; Digital Banking Transformation; Digital innovations; Digital transformation; Enterprise Architecture; Personalization services; Potential customers; Metadata",,,,,"Klaus, P., Nguyen, B., Exploring the role of the online customer experience in firms' multi-channel strategy: An empirical analysis of the retail banking services sector (2013) J.

The rise of predictive analytics (PA) is one of the biggest disruptions in financial services. In the last years, PA methods grew sharply to give the baseline of data driven decision-making process for forecasting future business situation. PA uses various algorithms to discover different patterns in the big data environment that might create more value for businesses including in financial institutions. The potential implementation of data science in financial industry is still to be explored. In this paper, we summarize work done on PA at financial industry.

New horizons emerged with the implementation of the BI concept using “Cloud Computing”. The leading IT companies compete to develop BI cloud-based services (cloud BI). This study aimed to determine the factors influencing manager decision to adopt cloud BI in Indonesia’s financial service sector, using the diffusion of innovation (DOI) model and technology organization environment (TOE) framework. The research also obtains prediction of the cloud BI marketing trend in Indonesia. The survey conducted with 30 participants at the senior management level in Indonesia’s financial services sector. The findings reveal, the adoption rate of cloud BI in Indonesia financial service sector still very low. Only 3.4% of firms have implemented cloud BI, while 10% not considering the cloud BI adoption. The results of this research can be used by vendors to develop cloud BI tools that fit into the customer’s need. It is also very useful for marketers to know the characteristics and demographics of cloud BI users. For regulators, this research illustrates how and what drives regulators to make policies that can encourage companies to use the latest technology. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cloud BI; Cloud business intelligence; DOI framework; TOE framework","Commerce; Database systems; Information analysis; Marketing; Surveys; Business intelligent; Cloud business; Diffusion of innovations; DOI framework; Financial services sector; Senior management; Technology-organization-environment frameworks; TOE framework; Finance",,,,,"Olszak, C.M., Toward better understanding and use of business intelligence in organizations (2016) Inf.

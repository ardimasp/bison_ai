Along with its growth, there are increasing threats to cloud computing because hackers are always exploiting vulnerabilities in the cloud computing infrastructure. XYZ Corporation is an IT system integrator company in Indonesia that has a private cloud infrastructure at the company's data center. Based on the interview, currently there is no cybersecurity in the private cloud and there have been several problems regarding the cybersecurity incident which has caused company financial, operational and reputation losses. The purpose of this study is to analyze current cybersecurity, find out the shortcomings and establish cybersecurity recommendations in the private cloud. This case study research refers to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and uses observation and interviews methods to gather information about current cybersecurity in the private cloud. The results are action plans, recommendations for human resources and cybersecurity technologies integration that are expected to increase the tier of security for information systems in the private cloud so threats and attacks can be detected and handled effectively and efficiently, therefore, confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems in the private cloud is achieved. This study results also can be adopted in companies that have private cloud which want to start improving information system security using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Cybersecurity; Information Security; NIST CSF; Private cloud; System Integrator Company",,,,,,"Mozumder, D.P., Mahi, J.N., Cloud Computing Security Breaches and Threats Analysis (2017) Int J Sci Eng Res, 8 (1), pp. 1287-1297; Sikhosana, B.H.S., (2016) Impact of Cloud Computing on Business, , University of Johannesburg; Schulze, H., Cloud Security Survey: 2016 Results (2016) Cloudpassage; (2014) Comparing Security Frameworks Series: PCI 3.0 and the CSC, , Tripwire Inc; (2014) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, , National Institute of Standards and Technology; Mell, P., Grance, T., (2011) The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing.

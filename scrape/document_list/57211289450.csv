It is able to affect the companys future purposefully. The study conducted to propose a novel decision support model (DSM) for determining the best marketer. Seventeen parameters were considered into model and two methods fuzzy logic and profile-matching (PM) were combined as main method in constructing the model theoretically. The model was applied in medical appliance marketing company. It is finally also able to measure and present the best ranking of marketers that is able to make company for easily making a crucial decision. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Thus, a selection process for top-marketer as a motivating compensation offered by company is an interesting study to conduct. Here, this study, by operating a combination of fuzzy-logic with profile-matching method, was performed to propose a decision model to help a company in deciding a top-marketer. Step-by-step ways to merge a combination of fuzzy-logic and profile-matching methods will be verified to decide feasibility of a top-marketer. Where through this method, marketers who have ideal standards that are in accordance with the needs of the company will be determined scientifically.

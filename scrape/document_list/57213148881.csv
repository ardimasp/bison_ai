The scheme of applying premium rates in Indonesia is uncorrelated when viewed from the basic principles of insurance in determining premium contributions.

The new schema is harness technology in the vehicle will recover in real time the vehicle data, including driving time, distance, and average speed, maximum speed of the driver, the amount of sharp turns, the location and the route of use of the vehicle which will be automatically stored in the database. Not only supported by technology but also the new schema vehicle in Indonesia acquired fairness in premium insurance price determination between good behavior driver and bad behavior driver. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Reported by the daily Republika.co.id, in 2013, Telkomsel operators claimed to have lost up to Three billion rupiahs more due to the theft of BTS batteries in only a few districts and cities in South Sulawesi. Therefore it is necessary to evaluate the method of using technology to prevent damage. The vandalism prevention system can design by utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The design uses a Raspberry Pi computing module, which is accompanied by a GSM transmission module to send a response signal to the motion captured by the camera.

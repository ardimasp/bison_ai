There were many elements that contributed to a traffic accident. Generally, the accident was caused by the aggression of the motorcyclist himself. The aggression behavior itself was usually correlated to stress, where stress would trigger the aggression behavior. This research was conducted to know how the stress contributed to the aggression. Using Buss Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AO) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), we conducted data collection on 208 motorcyclists in Jakarta. Based on the data tabulation result, it was inferred that stress contributed to motorcyclists aggression amounted to 14.2%. However, stress was not sufficient enough to predict the aggression of motorcyclist, but also the perception of the situation and the coping strategy used would also need to be considered. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

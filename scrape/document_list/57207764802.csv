Multiple things have to be considered in creating a competitive business, and one of them includes human resource management. The level of satisfaction of human resources used must be considered for it to be reciprocal to the company. For employees, one of their work satisfaction points is ease of work access. Residence location of mid to low-level employee is an important consideration especially in a retail business with outlets spread in many locations and employee salaries that tend to be low. This study took place in an international hardware retail company and aims to review the process of employee management, in particular, the process of recruitment and employee rotation based on geographical perspective. Various public transportation that supports access to work sites is assessed using a geographic information system approach. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In this research, we aim to create an artificial neural network model to choose a share to enter a portfolio based on its financial factors and big data about the financial condition of companies. The artificial neural network model has 15 input nodes of attributes associated with a company’s financial situation, 8 hidden layer nodes, and 1 output node. The accuracy of the model is 85.71%, with a learning rate of 0.05 trained over 2000 iterations. © 2020, The Author(s).","ANN; Big data; Neural network; Shares choice",,,,,"Binus University","This work is supported by BINUS University.","Ashwood, A.J., (2013) Portfolio Selection Using Artificial Intelligence, , DBA disertation of Queensland University of Technology; Fama, E.F., French, F.K., The cross-section of expected return (1992) J Financ, 47 (2), pp. 611-649; Farrell, J.L., Homogeneous stock grouping: implication for portfolio management (1975) Financ Anal J, 31 (3), pp. 50-62; Jones, C.P., (1992) Portfolio management, , McGraw-Hill’, New York; Khaksari, S., Kamath, R., Grieves, R., A new approach to determining optimum portfolio mix (1989) J Portf Manag, 15 (3), pp. 43-49; Manurung, A.H., (2002) Consistency of Shares Choice in Building Optimal Portfolio on Jakarta Stock Exchange by Fund Manager Associated to Ratio of Empirical Performance (Konsistensi Pemilihan Saham Dalam Pembentukan Portfolio Optimal Di BEJ Oleh Manajer Investasi Dikaitkan Dengan Variabel Rasio Empirik Kinerja Perusahaan), , Doctoral Disertation of University of Indonesia; Markowitz, H.M., Portfolio selection (1952) J Finance, 7 (1), pp. 77-95; Markowitz, H.M., Perold, A.F., Portfolio analysis with factors and scenarios (1981) J Financ, 36 (4), pp. 871-877; Marmer, H.S., Optimal international allocation under different economic environments: a Canadian perspective (1991) Financ Anal J, 3 (6), pp. 85-92; Peavy, J.W., Goodman, D.A., The significance of P/Es for portfolio returns (1983) J Portf Manag, 9 (2), pp. 43-47; Perritt, G.W., Lavine, A., (1990) Diversify: the investor’s guide to asset allocation strategies, , Longman Financial Services Publishing, USA; Rasekhschaffe, K.C., Jones, R.C., Machine Learning for Stock Selection (2019) Financ Anal J, 75 (3), pp. 70-88; Reily, F.K., Brown, K.C., (2002) Investment analysis and portfolio management, p. 272. , The Dryden Press, New York; Reinganum, M.C., The significance of market capitalization in portfolio management over time (1999) J Portf Manag., 25 (4), pp. 39-50; Saaty, T.L., Rogers, P.L., Pell, R., Portfolio selection through hierarchies (1980) J Portf Manag, 6 (3), pp. 16-21; Wainscott, C.B., The Stock-bond correlation and it’s implication for asset allocation (1990) Financ Anal J, 2 (2), pp. 55-60; Wallingford, B.A., A survey and comparison of portfolio selection models (1967) J Financ Quant Anal, 2 (2), pp. 85-106; Zhang, Y., Guo, Q., Wang, J., Big data analysis using neural networks (2017) Adv Eng Sci, 49, pp. 9-18","Budiharto, W.; School of Computer Science, Jl.

Based on data from 'The Role of SMEs in Asia and Their Difficulties in Accessing Finance', one of the four countries in Asia with the largest percentage of SMEs is Indonesia (99.9%). The authors will conduct this particular investigation on SMEs as they play a vital role and have a huge impact on the economic development of Indonesia. According to survey results from Price Waterhouse Coopers in 2014 regarding family businesses, 95% of businesses in Indonesia are owned or managed by families. Previous findings from family enterprise research show how family engagement as a function of family business positively affects the relationship between innovation and enterprise success. More than 1.022.213 publications released between 2014 and 2019 were screened using the keywords: digital business adoption, e-business adoption, e-commerce adoption, family commitment, family firms, SME innovation, and SME performance. Eventually, for this study, 21 journals were selected based on this analysis, the conceptual model has four possible connections: the good relationship between digital business adoption and SME achievements; the positive relationship between the adoption of digital business and innovativeness; the positive direct impacts of innovativeness on family-firm performance; and a good relationship between SME performance and family commitment and innovativeness. This research refers to a conceptual framework that could play a major part in the success of SMEs through digital business, family commitment, and innovativeness. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises represent around 97 to 99% of the enterprise population in most ASEAN countries. In Indonesia, small and medium-sized enterprises made up 99.99% of total businesses and employ 97% of the workforce. Based on data from small and medium-sized enterprises that are already using the internet in Indonesia, the use of e-commerce is still between 9 and 15%. One of the innovation types was frugal innovation, which can be defined as products, services, or solutions that arise regardless of financial, human, technological or other resource constraints, and where the end result is cheaper than competitive offers and meets the needs of customers who have not yet been served otherwise. The objective of this research is to investigate the impact of digital business adoption, frugal innovation, and organizational innovation on firm performance. The study was conducted using a descriptive quantitative method in Indonesia. A structured research questionnaire was developed using a Likert scale-four. Data from a total of 100 returned questionnaires was analysed with SEM-PLS. The results of this research show how the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is affected by digital business adoption, frugal innovation and organisational innovation. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

However, it is not always the same in the rural areas. Using the platform of Resource-Based View and Service Dominant Logic, this exploratory study utilizes focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with successful rural migrants with the objective to get insights on how to accelerate economic development at village level. This study concludes that in order to accelerate economic development at village level, they are encouraged to start with their resources and capabilities, and then innovatively crafted value creation and enhancement based on resources they have. It is very crucial to develop social-economic infrastructure to the market that will only happen with the involvement of all village institutions, both formal and informal. © 2020 SERSC.","Resource-Based View; Socio-Economic Infrastructure; Value Creation; Value Enhancement; Village Development",,,,,,,"Bappenas, (2011) Laporan Akhir: Evaluasi Pembangunan Pedesaaan [Final Report: Village Development Evaluation], National Development Planning Board; Barney, J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 15, pp. 175-190; Boddy, C.R., Sample size for qualitative research (2016) Qualitative Market Research: An International Journal, 19 (4), pp. 426-432; Boyatzis, R., (1998) Transforming Qualitative Information: Thematic Analysis and Code Development, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3 (2), pp. 77-101; Chandler, J., Lusch, R., Service System: A broadened framework and research agenda on value propositions, engagement and service experience (2005) Journal of Service Research, 8 (1), pp. 6-22; Corte, V.D., Resource-based view and service-dominant logic: Similarities, differences and further research (2013) Journal of Business Marketing Management, 6 (4), pp. 192-213; Statistik, B.P., (2018) Gini Ratio September 2017 Tercatat Sebesar 0,391.

Design/methodology/approach: Research data were collected from the executive management of telecommunication technology providers in Indonesia via a questionnaire survey to obtain 150 valid questionnaires for analysis. This study analyzed the overall model fit and causal relationship using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings: The results indicate that market orientation fully mediates the link between networking capability-business process agility and balanced APM-business process agility. Furthermore, business process agility mediates the relationship between market orientation and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This study is based on a cross-sectional nature and might fail to capture the dynamic of the studied variables over an extended period. Originality/value: The study extends the knowledge that dynamic capabilities, represented by networking capability and balanced APM, must be framed by market orientation to create customer value and improve bargaining position. However, market orientation alone is not enough in a highly dynamic business environment. Organization also requires business process agility, responsiveness and adaptability to timely address customers' needs and requirements. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business process agility; Firm performance; Market orientation; Networking capability, Balanced agile project management",,,,,,,"Aghina, W., Smet, A.D., Lackey, G., Lurie, M., Murarka, M., (2018) The 5 trademarks of agile organizations, , https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/the-five-trademarks-of-agile-organizations; Agirre, I., Reinares, P., Agirre, A., Antecedents to market orientation in the worker cooperative organization: the Mondragon group (2014) Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, 85 (3), pp. 387-408; Aguirre, F.H., Azcoitia, S.A., Marcos, C.S., (2019) Disrupting Telco Business Through SDN/NFV, , Deloitte, Madrid; Ahlbäck, K., Fahrbach, C., Murarka, M., Salo, O., (2017) How to create an agile organization, , https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/how-to-create-an-agile-organization; Ahuja, G., The duality of collaboration: inducements and opportunities in the formation of interfirm linkages (2000) Strategic Management Journal, 21, pp. 317-343; Alavi, S., Wahab, D.A., Muhamad, N., Shirani, B.A., Organic structure and organisational learning as the main antecedents of workforce agility (2014) International Journal of Production Research, 52 (21), pp. 6273-6295; Alpkan, L., Yilmaz, C., Kaya, N., Market orientation and planning flexibility in SMEs: performance implications and an empirical investigation (2007) International Small Business Journal, 25 (2), pp. 152-172; Altay, N., Gunasekaran, A., Dubey, R., Childe, S.J., Agility and resilience as antecedents of supply chain performance under moderating effects of organizational culture within the humanitarian setting: a dynamic capability view (2018) Production Planning and Control, 29 (14), pp. 1158-1174. , Taylor and Francis; Ambroise, L., Prim-allaz, I., Teyssier, C., Financial performance of servitized manufacturing firms: a configuration issue between servitization strategies and customer-oriented organizational design (2017) Industrial Marketing Management, 71, pp. 54-68. , Elsevier; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: a review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 411-423; Anderson, E., Jap, S.D., The dark side of close relationships (2005) MIT Sloan Management Review, 46 (3), pp. 75-82; Andersson, T., Cäker, M., Tengblad, S., Wickelgren, M., Building traits for organizational resilience through balancing organizational structures (2019) Scandinavian Journal of Management, 35 (1), pp. 36-45. , Elsevier; Annosi, M.C., Magnusson, M., Martini, A., Appio, F.P., Social conduct, learning and innovation: an abductive study of the dark side of agile software development (2016) Creativity and Innovation Management, 25 (4), pp. 515-535; Arnett, D.B., Sandvik, I.L., Sandvik, K., Two paths to organizational effectiveness – product advantage and life-cycle flexibility (2018) Journal of Business Research, 84 (March), pp. 285-292; Atkinson, H., Brown, J.B., Rethinking performance measures: assessing progress in UK hotels (2001) International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 13 (3), pp. 128-136; Atuahene-Gima, K., Ko, A., An empirical investigation of the effect of market orientation and entrepreneurship orientation alignment on product innovation (2001) Organization Science, 12 (1), pp. 54-74; Bajpai, R., Nesargi, S., Merchant, K., Pareek, V., (2015) Operationalizing SDN and NFV Networks, , Deloitte Consulting LLP, Dallas, Texas; Balashova, E.S., Gromova, E.A., Agile project management in telecommunications industry (2017) Espacios, 38, p. 41; Barnabas, N., Mekoth, N., Autonomy, market orientation and performance in Indian retail banking (2010) Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics, 22 (3), pp. 330-350; Barney, J., Firm resource and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Barney, J.B., Ketchen, D.J., Wright, M., The future of resource-based theory: revitalization or decline?

It was conducted among 67 companies in the financial industry listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange. The research was conducted using a cross-sectional study with a questionnaire to obtain a response from top management, during the period of May to November 2016. Multivariate analysis was done to test the hypothesis, using Structural Equation Modelling based on variance or Partial Least Square (PLS). In the research, it was found that implementation of corporate governance had a negative impact on competitive advantage, but had a positive effect on financial performance. Application of E-Business had a positive impact on financial performance, while the application of innovation had a positive effect on competitive advantage and financial performance. This research also confirmed that competitive advantage had a positive impact on the company's financial performance. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Competitive advantage; Corporate governance; E-business; Financial performance; Innovation",,,,,,"The authors wish to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika journal team that help publish this article.","Abdullah, A., Page, M., (2009) Corporate governance and corporate performance: UK FTSE 350 Companies, , Edinburgh, Scotland: The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland; Bahri, S., Yahya, D.

Customers are viewed as the object of firms' organizational activities to provide benefits for the company. The researcher broadens this view into a bigger perspective, where the customers are now not only becoming the objects, but also the subjects of the organizational activities. The purchase intention must move on to the next level where all actors in organizational activities are taking charge in delivering purchase intention. Human-to-human interaction has become so important in organizational activities that firms must articulate on these factors to complement the existing factors, especially during the Industry 4.0. This research uses a quantitative analysis with 91 respondents aged between 18 to 55 years old with income. The data analysis uses SPSS AMOS. The findings correlate with the newest Consumer Trend Report for 2020 and more that in the future, social interaction between humans takes a great deal in making purchase decisions, known as consumer conformity. Innovations must be done by gaining consumer insights and increasing social roles to the advantages of the firms through social comparison, image related concerns and strategic complements. This research has several limitations. First, data collection was based on convenience sampling and the second, the ideal number of respondents should be 385 based on Cochran's sampling method calculation. Future research should address these two issues. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt. Ltd.

However, the scholar work of literature about determinants of financial innovation is incomplete and limited. This paper propose new angle from Resource-Based View to indicate the determinant of financial innovation which are innovation organization, skill, peer, information technology and firm size. Using sample from mutual funds companies in Indonesia and the method of partial least square to analyze data, this paper finds that innovation organization, skill and technology information are significant to financial innovation.

For stockbrokers, understanding trends and forecasting supported by software are very important to decision making and reacting to changes in behavioral patterns. This paper proposes an algorithm and model for market forecasting in Indonesian exchange based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and compared with ARIMA model. We use data from Bank Central Asia (BCA) from 2013-2018 obtained from Yahoo finance. In our experiments, we predict and simulate the important prices called Open, High, Low and Closing (OHLC) with various parameters. Based on the experiment, the best accurate prediction in LSTM comes from the short term (1 year) with high epoch in training phase rather than using 3 years or 5 years of training data, and our model has better result compared with popular model such as ARIMA. These results should be very useful to be used in stock exchange office. © 2018, ICIC International.

Internal factors are selected under this study consists of several aspects such as growth of the bank's assets, profitability, efficiency, capital adequacy, liquidity, and risk, meanwhile external factors are market power, inflation, and interest rates. Several variables have been used in previous studies to be used as a proxy. The study applied fixed effects on a panel data regression model to a panel of Indonesian commercial banks that covers the period 2008-2012. The results show consistent findings from previous studies. The net interest margin of Indonesian commercial banks are affected by the entire internal variables on a different level of significance, meanwhile inflation is the only external factors that affects on interest margins significantly at 5% level. © 2014 Econjournals.

Using panel data regression, we analyze internal and external factors affecting corporate financial distress. To distinguish the status of financial condition, the process of integral corporate financial distress is classified into four steps: good, early impairment, deterioration and cash flow problem companies. The results show that current ratio (CR), efficiency (Eff), equity (EQ) and dummy variable of the status good financial condition (D3) have positive and significant influences to Debt Service Coverage (DSC) as a proxy of financial distress. On the other hand, leverage (Lev) has a negative and significant relation with DSC. Other variables such as profit, retain earning (RE), good corporate governance (GCG) and macroeconomic factor have no significant impact on the status of corporate financial distress. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that profitable companies should not be a guarantee that the companies can survive to fulfill its liabilities. Liquidity of companies which can be a prominent point can be recognized by evaluating cash flow performance. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.","Corporate financial distress; Debt service coverage (DSC); Indonesia stock exchange (IDX); Panel data",,,,,,,"Adrian, G., Kuldeep, K., (2008) The Role of Survival Analysis in Financial Distress Prediction, , Faculty of Business, Bond University Gold Coast, QLD 4229, Australia; Almeida, H., Philippon, T., (2000) The Risk-Adjusted Cost of Financial Distress, , The Stern School of Business, New York University, USA; Altman, E.I., Hotchkiss, E., (2006) Corporate Financial Distress and Bankcrupty 3rd Edition, , John Wiley and Son, Inc.

Two different events affected the performance of public companies being financial distress. In 2005, there was an oil price shock when the government cut off subsidy for local oil price. Another event in 2007-2008 is the impact of sub-prime mortgage in the USA, where US Dollar repatriation makes global financial crisis included Indonesia. Mostly, financial burden of public companies in Indonesia are cost of money, mainly due to having bank loan and issuing corporate bond. Therefore, the analysis uses Debt Service Coverage (DSC) as a proxy financial distress. DSC becomes one of the most important indicators for commercial bank to see financial condition prior to lending as well as underwriting of bond issuance. This paper would also analyze corporate financial distress by mapping companies in to the steps of process integral financial distress in declining financial performance from good companies, early impairment, deterioration and cashflow problem. Furthermore, mapping will also been done for five different industrial sectors, i.e. agricultural business, mining, manufacture, contruction/properties and services/trade. The results show that oil price shock and sub-prime mortgage crisis have different impacts on the financial performance of the companies listed on the IDX. The impacts seem also varies across different industrial sectors. The evidence indicated that the mining companies are the most affected companies by global financial crisis in 2008, whereas manufacturing companies are the most affected companies by oil price shock in 2005.","Corporate financial distress; Debt Service Coverage (DSC); Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX)",,,,,,,"Abid, F., Zohari, A., Predicting corporate financial distress: A New neural networksapproach (2002) Journal of finance India, 16 (2), pp. 601-611; Andrade, K., How costly is financial (not economic) distress? evidence from highlyleveraged transactions that became distressed (1998) Journal of Finance, 53, pp. 1443-1493; Almeida, H., Thomas, P., (2000) The Risk-Adjusted cost of Financial Distress, , The Stern School of Business, New York University, USA; Altman, L.A.E., (2000) Predicting financial distress of companies: Revisiting the Z-scoreand Zeta models, , New York University.

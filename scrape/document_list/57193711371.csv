By knowing and understanding an individuals personality, many advantages can be obtained. Together with rapid growth of technology, knowing an individuals personality can be done automatically. Psychology researches suggest that certain personality traits have correlation with linguistic behavior. Supported by the fame of social media, predicting humans personality from their post become possible. Most existing researches have done similar approach in predicting personality from social media. However, focuses on closed vocabulary investigation with English as their language and mostly based on Big Five personality type. In this paper, we explore Twitter as data source for open vocabulary personality prediction in Indonesia. We analyze and compare three different statistical model and find correlation about which personality traits are related with linguistic behavior. As a result, Naïve Bayes classifier outperforms the other statistical model with the highest accuracy (80% for I/E and 60% for S/N, T/F, and J/P personality traits) and shows the best performance in terms of speed in classifying the users. Moreover, a simple application was developed based on the best statistical model compared before to classify an individual's personality with their Twitter username and gender as an input. In addition, the top 30 of most frequently used words per personality traits is also the result of this experiment, in which all of the experiments has been validated with a psychology expert. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Classification (of information); Forecasting; Linguistics; Bayes Classifier; Personality predictions; Personality traits; Personality types; Rapid growth; Social media; Statistical modeling; User personalities; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Furnham, A., Crump, J., The myers-briggs type indicator (mbti) and promotion at work (2015) Psychology, 6 (12), p. 1510; Back, M.D., Stopfer, J.M., Vazire, S., Gaddis, S., Schmukle, S.C., Egloff, B., Gosling, S.D., Facebook profiles reflect actual personality, not self-idealization (2010) Psychological Science; Bijalwan, V., Kumari, P., Pascual, J., Semwal, V.B., Machine learning approach for text and document mining (2014) ArXiv Preprint arXiv:1406, 1580; Yoo, J.-Y., Yang, D., (2015) Classification Scheme of Unstructured Text Document Using Tf-idf and Naive Bayes Classifier; Oberlander, J., Nowson, S., Whose thumb is it anyway?: Classifying author personality from weblog text (2006) Proceedings of the COLING/ACL on Main Conference Poster Sessions.

The ISIS has targeted Indonesia as the main source of participants due to the large of Muslim community with active internet users. Despite many ways to connect with social media like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube using videos and images, this paper is selected text as the main of source of materials. This paper is deployed a qualitative technique to analyze related literature and then it was combined with media tracking systems from texts posted on Twitter, Facebook, Website, and Telegram. The text mining was captured words that frequently appears that mentioned their support to the ISIS accounts from 2011 to 2017. This paper found that Indonesian tends to pay more attention to the existence of ISIS in Syria. This paper suggests that the Indonesian related agency to closely monitor the accounts which positively associated with ISIS terrorism and propaganda and take necessary action to clean up the massive haywire issues. © 2020 IEEE.","ISIS; Recruitment; Social media; Terrorism; Text mining","Information management; Social networking (online); Terrorism; Facebook; Indonesia; Internet users; Media tracking; Social media; Text mining techniques; YouTube; Text mining",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

Radicalism gives destructive impacts to an attacked country and the global society. It is not only makes a serious threat to a nation unity, yet it also impacts the cultural, socio-political, and economic among the others. This study is aim to study radicalism intention using content detection. The model was developed using social media content like posting, comment and conversation to indicate the level of radicalism. Data was collected from a Twitter. It has chosen as a social media platform because Twitter can engage the community with powerful and impactful microblogging function. The data was analyzed using machine learning. To be specifically, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) in text mining employed for classification of Twitter's content in national language of republic Indonesia. There were two focus keywords used in this study. The first one is ISIS and follow by Syria. The result shows that 83.3% accuracy of test set tuples, 90% part of the contents indicates positive link to radicalism with no-radicalism class as a precision value. Besides recall value was calculated for accuracy, 95% and 82% part of actual text positively link as radicalism class with a proxy of no-radicalism class. This model is hoped to detect and overcome the terrorism issue in Indonesia. © 2020 IEEE.","Machine learning; Radicalism; Support vector machine; Terrorism; Twitter","Information management; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Text mining; Content detection; Global society; Microblogging; National language; Social media; Social media platforms; Support vector machine techniques; Test sets; Support vector machines",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

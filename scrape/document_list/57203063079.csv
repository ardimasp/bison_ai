However, the research on the phenomenon of applying social media marketing to museums has been investigated by international researchers, but has never been done by researchers in Indonesia. This study has a focus on testing whether the Museum Facebook Fan Page User Experience is a mediator or moderator variable between user motivations and user expectations of intention to use Facebook Museum Fan page and whether the online community involvement moderates the relation between the Facebook Fan Page usage intention to the visit museum intention. The research design is the quantitative approach. Data was collected using a questionnaire distributed to followers of the museum Facebook Fan Page in Indonesia. The researchers was randomly select the museum Facebook Fan Page and online cultural community Facebook groups in Indonesia. The sample size was 270 respondents. The data analysis is the Structural Equation Modeling analysis method using AMOS Ver. 22. In this study, eight hypotheses are accepted and one hypothesis is rejected. The r2 of the Facebook Fan Page usage intention is 0.446, it means that the variable can be explained by user expectations, user motivations, and Facebook Fan Page User Experience. The r2 of the visit museum intention is 0.350, it means that the variable can be explained by the Facebook Fan Page User Experience and online community involvement. The contribution of this research is to contribute the Facebook Adoption model that accommodates the Facebook Fan Page usage experience and the online community involvement for marketing and cultural education in the Museum industry in Indonesia. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Facebook Fan Page User Experience; Online Community Involvement; The Facebook Fan Page Usage Intention; The Visit Museum Intention; User Expectations; User Motivations",,,,,,"(2016) Slideshare: Global Digital Statistics for 2016, , http://www.digitalbuzzblog.com/slideshareglobal-digital-statistics-report-for-2016, [Accessed: 07-Jun-2016]; Utama, I.G.B.R., Mengelola Warisan Budaya Sebagai Produk Pariwisata (2015) Researchgate, , http://www.yayasankertagama.org/article/article3.pdf, [Accessed: 13-Mar-2017]; UNESCO, (2008) Towards Sustainable Strategies for Creative Tourism; (2017) Tentang Pemajuan Kebudayaan. 2017; Wulandari, A.A.A., Fajarwati, A.A.S., Latif, F., The Relationship of Exhibition Space Design and the Success of Delivering Messages to Museum Visitors in Jakarta (2017) Humaniora, 8 (3), p. 219. , Oct; Sulistiyana, R.T., Hamid, D., Azizah, D.F., Pengaruh Fasilitas Wisata dan Harga Terhadap Kepuasan Konsumen (Studi pada Museum Satwa) (2015) J.

Research stages are done through literature based on End-User Computing Satisfaction (EUCS) satisfaction factor which consists of content, accuracy, timeless, ease of use and format. Questionnaires were developed based on each factor of EUCS and distributed to the user ie the students. Based on the formula Izaac and Michael the results of the sample calculation there are 380 students who become sample. Based on data from questionnaires that have been distributed validation test and reliability of 20 data responder first before further processing. The result of the questionnaire that has been collected is analyzed to the gap between expectation and reality to get user satisfaction on the use of LMS. After obtaining user satisfaction, it is done by Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach to determine what factors influence student's satisfaction by the factor on EUCS. The results show that users are not satisfied with all factors, and factor accuracy is the most important factor in determining user satisfaction, while the most important experience factor is timelines. The results of the open questionnaire, the user provides input for improvements to LMS related to access speed and feature addition and development of mobile-based LMS. © 2018 IEEE.","AHP; analytical hierachy process; end-user computing satisfaction; EUC; learning management systems; LMS","Hierarchical systems; Information management; Students; Surveys; Web browsers; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Ease-of-use; End user computing; Learning management system; Research stages; Student's satisfaction; User satisfaction; Validation test; Human computer interaction",,,,,"Watson, W.R., Watson, S.L., An argument for clarity: What are learning management systems, what are they not, and what should they become?

The purpose of this research is to recognize fraudulent transactions on debit cards with development of the Enhanced Auxiliary Classifier-Generative Adversarial Network (EAC-GAN) model which is a development of Auxiliary Classifier-Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN) model. EAC-GAN uses AC-GAN, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and tuning parameter to recognize fraud transactions in debit cards and increase F1-Score. SMOTE is used to overcome imbalanced data in debit card transactions dataset. Then PCA is required to reduce dimension of the dataset and to know which factors are influential in explaining the phenomenon in the dataset while maintaining characteristics of the data. Parameter tuning is useful to achieve the best F1-Score in training and testing the EAC-GAN model. This research also explores the study of AC-GAN and Convolutional Neural Network 2 Dimension (CNN2D) performance. The result of this research describes that EAC-GAN model beats CNN2D done in the previous research. F1-Score for EAC-GAN is 74% and F1-Score generated by the CNN2D model is 35%. Conclusion from this research is that EAC-GAN model works better in fraud transaction in debit cards surpassing CNN2D model. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

For building a supervised machine learning to predict cardiovascular disease risk, a best classifier is tested and selected to fit with the model data. In selecting the best classifier model, five classifiers were used to train the data. In this process, each classifier used sixty thousand medical records from Mayapada private hospital for data training and testing. The data was initially divided into 38 attributes. The training model of each classifier was measured and evaluated using classification accuracy, classification error and F-measurement. As a result, Gradient Boosted Trees classifier was selected as the best classifier with the highest accuracy rate more than 80%, F-measure is more than 92% and the classification error is less than 12%. Hence, a backend machine learning API was built based on this Gradient Boosted Trees classifier and it has been tested for training and predicting the cardiovascular disease risk through the Postman application. © 2020 ISSN 1881-803X.","API (Application Programming Interface); Classifier; Supervised machine learning",,,,,,"Acknowledgment.

More specifically, debit card transaction data from a private Indonesian bank were categorized into fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. Training and testing datasets were then analyzed. Due to its architectural similarity, this study explores the learning performance of an AC-GAN Discriminator model and compares it with the learning performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, as a baseline model. The experimental results illustrate that the training and testing accuracy of the AC-GAN discriminator model (i.e., 81.1% and 93.0%, respectively) outperformed the CNN model (i.e., 68.1% and 67.7%). Given the similar structures of AC-GAN discriminators and CNN models, it is hypothesized that AC-GAN discriminators can perform better than CNNs. This is because the effect of the adversarial training approach embedded up-sampling techniques into the model-training process. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Data helps organization to get valuable insights, allows itself to be innovative and provides ability to develop its unique competitive advantage. Despite of its strategic role, many organizations neglect the necessity to manage their data properly, mainly due to its broad scope, and complexities. The strategic value of data could not be obtained only by capturing and storing it. Instead, data management initiative is required to develop, execute and supervise plans, policies, programs and processes to deliver, control, protect and enhance the data. The entire data lifecycle process needs to be properly planned and managed in order to ensure data integrity, data quality, data security, and data privacy. This study aims to brief the key aspects of data management framework for early adopters based on Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on selected 25 relevant papers. As the conclusion, the study has identified multiple data management frameworks that are available to provide sufficient guide for data management implementation. Organization could selectively customize the framework implementation based on their specific needs and readiness. Organization also can choose to implement data management framework in stages/incremental manner. © 2019 ICIC International.

The challenge is how to take out the potential benefit of texts. Textmining is a solution. In this paper, we report our research in developing text miningapplication namely Named Entity Recognition (NER) applied to the collection of shortmessage service owned by a marketing agency. We built NER modules which can per-form NER modeling and prediction to extract important entities stated in each SMStext from three SMS text collections (Bank X, Bank Y, and Accommodation ReservationCompany Z). We constructed three NER models by using three SMS corpora. The NERmodels can predict and extract entities from 195,036 SMS texts of Bank X with accuracy99.66%, 26,072 SMS texts of Bank Y with accuracy 98.88% and 525,121 SMS texts ofAccommodation Reservation Company Z with accuracy 96.20%.

Fraud detection requires a lot of investments, complex algorithms, training and testing. Fraud destroy the reputation of banks, loss of financials, and loss of the country's finances. This research is conducted in order to propose a model using neural network and data mining to detect fraud in debit card transaction. Neural network can be used as a benchmark to develop a logistic regression model in data mining. The evaluation of performance classifier (accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) in this research showed that the proposed model predicted class label tuple correct (76.3%). The result supports fraud analysis in debit card transaction in ATM. In conclusion the results show that the model has a good performance in detecting fraud in a debit card transaction. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Crime; Data mining; Information systems; Information use; Internet protocols; Regression analysis; Automated teller machines; Class labels; Complex algorithms; Fraud detection; Logistic Regression modeling; On-line banking; Sensitivity and specificity; Training and testing; Automatic teller machines",,,,,,"Case, P., Sisat, S.N., (2014) Secured Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) and Cash Deposit Machine (CDM), 7782, pp. 118-121; Indonesia, B., (2009) Mengenal Kartu Debit & ATM, pp. 1-2; Kebijakan Makroprudensial, D., Kajian Stabilitas Keuangan (2014) Igarss 2014, pp. 1-5; Keuangan Otoritas, J., (2015) Bijak Ber-eBanking, , (Bank Indonesia); General Western Australian, A., (2013) Fraud Prevention and Detection in the Public Sector, pp. 1-24; Jog, Vivek, V., Pardeshi Nilesh, R., Advanced Security Model for Detecting Frauds in ATM Transaction (2014) International Journal of Computer Applications, 95 (15), pp. 47-50; Anderka, M., Klerx, T., Priesterjahn, S., Büning, H.K., Automatic ATM Fraud Detection as a Sequence-based Anomaly Detection Problem (2014) Proc. 3rd Int.

It is required for universities to comply with the regulation of the ministry of research, technology, and higher education of the Republic of Indonesia, Number 32 of 2016 on the accreditation of study programs and universities. However, there are many difficulties in analyzing active student reports, additional and ad hoc reports, and the need for business intelligence and data mining development. The purpose of this research is to analyze and design data warehouse to integrate various operational databases needed to provide information about active students at XYZ University. The method of analysis is done by running system analysis and analysis of the running system weaknesses. While the data warehouse design method uses 4 stages (Four-Step Methodology) used by Ralph Kimball in designing a data warehouse. The stages are selecting the business process, declaring grain, identifying the dimensions, and identifying facts. The results achieved are the design of data warehouse and dashboard that will provide relevant and integrated information about active students that can be viewed from different angles. Designed data warehouses are needed to help organizations to analyze information as needed and help management to make strategic decisions. The conclusion is that with the build of a data warehouse to support active student management can help the university to analyze active student and make decisions in the student area. © 2018 IEEE.","dashboard; data warehouse; four-step methodology; strategic","Data mining; Data warehouses; Decision making; Information management; Students; dashboard; four-step methodology; Integrated informations; Method of analysis; Operational database; strategic; Strategic decisions; Student management; Design",,,,,,"Santoso, L.W., Analysis of the Impact of Information Technology Investments-A Survey of Indonesian Universities (2014) Petra Christian University; Santoso, L.W., Data Warehouse with Big Data Technology for Higher Education (2017) Procedia Comput.

But to improve, it is very difficult. A company often get a problem to achieve a standardization of Information Technology (IT) services. This paper aims to propose an effectiveness and efficiency design of ITSM through capability maturity model integration (CMMI) in an organization to manage IT division. ITSM is affected by the procedure, performance, and capability of IT division. They determine the success level of the Services Level Agreement (SLA) within the organization. Derived from literature studies and interviews from the organization management member and the IT user, the paper argue that the practice of information technology infrastructure library (ITIL) done by CMMI is recommended to improve the IT services to support an organization to meet SLA. © 2017 IEEE.","CMMI; IT Services; ITSM; SLA","Information management; Software engineering; Capability maturity model integration; CMMI; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Information technology infrastructure library (ITIL); Information technology services; IT services; ITSM; Services level agreements; Efficiency",,,,,,"Kumbakara, N., Managed IT services: The role of IT standards (2008) Inf.

The premise of this research is fraudulent transaction contains 'anomaly' from the pattern of non-fraudulent transactions so that the anomalous pattern can be detected and separated at some point using classification models. Less availability dataset for research, non-stationary distribution of the data, highly imbalanced class distributions, and continuous streams of transactions become the main driven of using CHAID and k-NN classification method. Empiric result using actual debit card transaction using ATM services shows that Accuracy of CHAID model is 0.8 and F = 0.7; and k-NN model (for k=3) is 0.7 and F = 0.6 These results are comparable to previous studies using Hidden Markov Models. © 2016 IEEE.","CHAID; debit card fraud recognition; k-NN","Classification (of information); Crime; Hidden Markov models; Markov processes; CHAID; Classification models; Debit cards; Fraudulent transactions; Imbalanced class; K-nearest neighbors; K-NN classifications; Transaction records; Nearest neighbor search",,,,,,"Case, P., Sisat, S.N., (2014) Secured Automatic Teller Machine (ATM).

The data contains information that is essential for the development of health care. Data warehouse (DW) development has been widely used in business, but it also can be used in health care. The objective of this study is design a model of data warehouse that can be implemented in radiology department so it can be a source of knowledge of radiology science. The research method used on this study are 1) data collection through literature review, forum group discussion with radiologist, and observations; 2) design method of data warehouse using the fourth stages of data warehouse design methodology Kimball and Ross (2013). Through this research we will design a radiology data warehouse so the radiologist or researcher can analyze report requirement from case study of patient historical record and assess the accuracy of diagnosis by comparing the results of radiological diagnosis with laboratory test results and other medical record from anamneses, medical procedure, medical treatment, or patient questionnaire. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT & LLS.

Attributes such as mechanics and dynamics that can be added to a system other than games make gamification development begin to be carried out in all business sectors. This paper aims at inviting millennial generation to be aware of the long-term insurance needs by using elements in the game. Millennial are known to learn fast in using new things and get bored quickly. While insurance companies in Indonesia think about how insurance products are made and assume their products can make all people want to buy insurance, but in reality, almost all insurance products fail to get the millennial market. An obstacle that usually happens is where millennial is confused in choosing the means to spend money even though they have small income. Microinsurance is the right choice for millennial generation in terms of insurance. As for the design of gamification in this paper using the MDE (mechanics, dynamics, emotions) framework which is believed to be able to attract millennial interest in having insurance. © 2020 SERSC.","Gamification; Insurance; MDE framework; Microinsurance; Millennial",,,,,,"Roth, J., McCord, M., Liber, D., (2007) The Landscape of Microinsurance in the World’s 100 Poorest Countries - Microinsurance Centre, , April; Ovier, A., (2019) Penetrasi Jasa Keuangan Di Kalangan Milenial Perlu Didongkrak; Martin, C.A., Turley, L.W., Malls and consumption motivation: An exploratory examination of older Generation Y consumers (2004) International Journal of Retail & Distribution Management; Wolburg, J.M., Pokrywczynski, J., A Psychographic Analysis of Generation Y College Students (2001) J.

Any structures constructed along the coastline, such as pavement layer on sea dike, must be able to resist the hydrodynamic forces from the waves, such as the overtopping wave. It is necessary to find an aggregate to be used as surfacing layer for sea dike and/or flexible pavement that can withstand these (compressive) forces. This research analyses the feasibility of two natural aggregates, namely the coral and limestone aggregates, to be used as an ingredient for asphalt surface layer on coastal structures. Asphalt mix samples were prepared by using these two aggregates with various percentage of asphalt. The Marshall stability, flow, and the compressive force (Flab) of the prepared samples were tested in the laboratory. The stability and the flow of asphalt samples were tested to verify that the asphalt mix satisfies the requirements specified by Standar Nasional Indonesia 06-2489-1991. Moreover, this research also calculates the overtopping waves by varying the height and the period of the waves. The results were then converted as a compressive force (Fwave) and compared to the Flab to see whether the prepared samples could resist the calculated Fwave. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",,"Asphalt; Coastal engineering; Hydraulic structures; Levees; Limestone; Pavements; Underwater foundations; Asphalt surface layer; Coastal structures; Compressive forces; Flexible pavements; Hydrodynamic forces; Limestone aggregates; Marshall stability; Overtopping waves; Aggregates",,,,,"Jassim, I., Tan, S., Vermeer, P.A., Hicks, M.A., (2012) Conference of the Association for Computational Mechanics in Engineering ACME; Pilarczyk, K.W., (1998) Dikes and Revetments: Design, Maintenance and Safety Assessment; Nandlal, S., (1985) Lightweight Semi-flexible Dike; Van Der Meer, J., Pilarczyk, K.W., (1998) Seawalls, Dikes and Revetments; (1977) Asphalt Revetments of Dyke Slopes, , Committee on The Compaction of Asphalt Revetments of Dyke Slopes; Devnita, R., (2009) Jurnal Geologi Indonesia, 4 (1), pp. 19-29; Yamin, A., (2011) Jurnal Jalan - Jembatan, 28, p. 3; Ogundipe, O.M., (2016) Transportation Research Procedia, 14, pp. 685-693; Manglorkar, D., Kandhal, P.S.K., Parker, F., (1991) Evaluation of Limestone Coarse Aggregate in Asphalt Concrete Wearing Courses 1991, , Auburn University Highway Research Center Alabama, United States of America; Chairuddin, F., Tjaronge, M.W., Ramli, M., Patanduk, J., (2016) IACSIT International Journal of Engineering and Technology, 8, p. 3; Bowers, N.A., (1944) Engineering News Record, pp. 80-85. , July; (1993) A Guide to the Structural Design of Bitumen-Surfaced Roads in Tropical and Sub-Tropical Countries, , Overseas Centre, Transportation and Road Research Laboratory; Palmer, J., (2013) Use of Coral As An Engineered Construction Aggregate in Pacific Runways; Schlüttrumpf, H., Van Der Meer, J., Kortenhaus, A., Bruce, T., Franco, L., Kim, Y.C., (2010) Handbook of Coastal and Ocean Engineering; Van Der Meer, J.W., Janssen, J.P.F.M., Kobayashi, N., Demirbilek, Z., (1995) Wave Forces on Inclined and Vertical Wall Structures; Franco, L., Gerloni, M.D., Van Der Meer, J.W., (1994) Coastal Engineering, pp. 1030-1045; Van Gent, M.R.A., (2002) 28th Conference on Coastal Engineering; Steendam, G.J., Van Der Meer, J.W., Hardeman, B., Van Hoven, A., (2012) International Conference on Coastal Engineering ICCE; Wati, W., (2015) Pengaruh Penambahan Bahan Alami Lateks (Getah Karet) Terhadap Karakteristik Campuran Hot Rolled Sheet Wearing Course (HRSWC); Bruce, T., Van Der Meer, J.W., Pullen, T., Allsop, W., (2009) Wave Overtopping at Vertical and Steep Structure; (2007) Calculation Tool, , http://www.overtopping-manual.com/aboutthis-site.html, HR Wallingford Ltd; Pullen, T., Allsop, N.W.H., Bruce, T., Kortenhaus, A., Schlüttrumpf, H., Van Der Meer, J.W., (2007) EurOtop Wave Overtopping of Sea Defences and Related Structures: Assessment Manual; (2010) Dokumen Pelelangan Nasional - Penyediaan Pekerjaan Konstruksi (Pemborongan) Untuk Kontrak Harga Satuan, , Direktorat Jenderal Bina Marga","Dwidarma Nataadmadja, A.; Civil Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: anataadmadja@binus.edu","Iskandar I.Agustina T.E.Komariah L.N.Ismadji S.Yani I.Hasyim S.","","EDP Sciences","1st Sriwijaya International Conference on Engineering, Science and Technology, SICEST 2016","9 November 2016 through 10 November 2016",,126687,2261236X,,,,"English","MATEC Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015903236

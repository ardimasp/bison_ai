Cashless payment system is an emerging market in Indonesia. There are many of users and merchants that have been adopting cashless payment system replacing the conventional transactions. Micro-merchant is one of the stakeholders of mobile payment ecosystem which specifically receiving the low-value payment transaction from the mobile payment users. To measure micro-merchant’s readiness in continuing their usage on cashless payment system, we used the Technology Readiness Index (TRI) 2.0 approach. Parasuraman and Colby (2014) developed TRI 2.0 as a research scale in measuring and classifying individuals by their propensity to adopt technology. This research will provide the highlights of current situation of micro-merchant’s technology readiness and their continuance intention to adopt cashless payment system based on TR constructs. There are four constructs which are Optimism, Innovativeness, Discomfort and Insecurity that will be tested to find their relationship to the continuance intention in adopting cashless payment system. This research found that optimism is a determinant factor driving the micro-merchants’ continuance intention to adopt cashless payment system while discomfort is becoming main inhibitor. © 2020 IJSTR.","Cashless payment system; Micro-merchant; Mobile payment; Technology readiness; TRI",,,,,,"Ariani, A., Napitupulu, D., Jati, R., Kadar, J., Syafrullah, M., Testing of Technology Readiness Index Model Based on Exploratory Factor Analysis Approach (2018) Journal of Physics: Conference Series; Aron, J., Mobile Money and the Economy: A Review of the Evidence (2018) The World Bank Research Observer, 33 (2), pp. 135-188; Arvidsson, N., Consumer attitudes on mobile payment services-results from a proof of concept test (2014) International Journal of Bank Marketing, 32 (2), pp. 150-170; Au, Y.A., Kauffman, R.J., The economics of mobile payments: Understanding stakeholder issues for an emerging financial technology application (2008) Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 7 (2), pp. 141-164; Celik, H., Kocaman, R., Roles of Self-Monitoring, Fashion Involvement and Technology Readiness in an Individual's Propensity to Use Mobile Shopping (2017) Journal of System and Information Technology; Dahlberg, T., Guo, J., Ondrus, J., A critical review of mobile-payment research (2015) Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 14 (5), pp. 265-284; Eka, R., (2018) Trend of the Development of ""Mobile Payment"" in Indonesia., , https://dailysocial.id/post/perkembangan-mobile-payment-indonesia, March 6, Retrieved January 14, 2019, from dailysocial.id; Gombachika, H.S., Khangamwa, G., (2013) ICT Readiness and Acceptance among TEVT Students in University of Malawi, 30 (1), pp. 35-43; Guo, J., Bouwman, H., An analytical framework for an m-payment ecosystem: A merchants' perspective (2015) Telecommunications Policy, 40 (2-3), pp. 147-167; Hair, J.F., Jr., Black, W.C., Babin, B.J., Anderson, R.E., (2014) Multivariate Data Analysis, , 7 ed.).

However, given the great degree of uncertainty, software developers must continually cope with extremely rapid changes that demand innovative technological and managerial responses. Based on dynamic capability theory and strategic organizational flexibility, this study developed a theoretical model to explore the effect of dynamic capability and technology flexibility on product development competencies and product superiority. Data were collected from 112 business executives from packaged software firms in Indonesia. Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis supports the study's hypotheses that when dynamic capability and technology flexibility are introduced to the model, the relationship between a software firm's functional competencies and product superiority becomes insignificant. The findings can provide guidelines for software developers to cultivate dynamic capability and pursue technology flexibility to craft superior software products. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Dynamic capability; Product development competencies; Product superiority; Technology flexibility",,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., Kumar, V., Day, G.S., (2008) Marketing Research, , Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), p. 411; Bagozzi, R.P., Yi, Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models (1988) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16 (1), pp. 74-94; Brown, S.L., Eisenhardt, K.M., The art of continuous change: Linking complexity theory and time-paced evolution in relentlessly shifting organizations (1997) Administrative Science Quarterly, 42 (1), pp. 1-34; Chin, W.W., The partial least squares approach to structural equation modeling (1998) Modern Methods for Business Research, 295 (2), pp. 295-336; Cooper, R.G., Selecting winning new product projects: Using the new product system (1985) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 2 (1), pp. 34-44; Danneels, E., The dynamics of product innovation and firm competences (2002) Strategic Management Journal, 23 (12), pp. 1095-1121; Das, R.K., Elango, B., Managing strategic flexibility: Key to effective performance (1995) Journal of General Management, 20 (3), pp. 60-75; Day, G.S., The capabilities of market-driven organizations (1994) Journal of Marketing, 58 (4), pp. 37-52; Dosi, G., Nelson R R, R., Winter, S., (2000) The Nature and Dynamics of Organizational Capabilities, , Oxford University Press, New York; Eisenhardt, K.M., Tabrizi, B.N., Accelerating adaptive processes: Product innovation in the global computer industry (1995) Administrative Science Quarterly, 40 (1), pp. 84-110; Eisenhardt, K.M., Brown, S.L., Patching: Restitching business portfolio in dynamic markets (1999) Harvard Business Review, 77 (3), pp. 72-82; Fornell, C., Larcker, D.F., Structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error: Algebra and statistics (1981) Journal of Marketing Research, 18 (3), pp. 382-388; Galunic, D.C., Eisenhardt, K.M., Architectural innovation and modular corporate forms (2001) Academy of Management Journal, 44 (6), pp. 1229-1249; Garud, R., Kotha, S., Using the brain as a metaphor to model flexible production systems (1994) Academy of Management Review, 19 (4), pp. 671-698; Gefen, D., Straub, D., A practical guide to factorial validity using PLS-Graph: Tutorial and annotated example (2005) Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 16 (1), p. 5; Haigh, M., Software quality, non-functional software requirements and IT- businessalignment (2010) Software Quality Journal, 18 (3), pp. 361-385; Hair, J.F., Hult, G.T.M., Ringle, C., Sarstedt, M., (2014) A Primer on Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM)., , https://www.pls-sem.net/downloads/2st-edition-a-primer-on-pls-sem/, Retrieved on April 1, 2017; Hamel, G., Prahalad, C.K., (1994) Competing for the Future, , Boston, Massachusetts: Harvard Business School Press; Henderson, R., Cockburn, I., Measuring competence?

Comparing to other alternatives of mobile payment, the proximity mobile payment using NFC technology clearly has an advantage. Not only it is fast, secure, and intuitive, the implementation of NFC opens up a new world of opportunities to be used for other value-adding purposes aside from proximity mobile payment services. The benefits and potential growth in Indonesia supports business cause for investing in this breakthrough payment service.

Many countries already implemented Green IT initiatives to reduce carbon emissions. Studied about the level of awareness of Green IT has been done in many countries, except Indonesia. Indonesia has committed to reduce carbon emission by 26% in 2020 and Green IT is one of the potential ways to be implemented to achieve the goal. This proposed paper is going to use survey that has been done previously by RMIT University and Info~Tech to get the level of awareness of Green IT among IT professionals in Indonesia. The results then will be compared to other countries and to highlight the opportunities to increase the awareness level in Indonesia. Following study will be under taken to assess the Green IT readiness index of companies in Indonesia as per Green IT framework developed by previous researchers.","Awareness; Carbon emissions; CO2; Environmental footprint; Green IT; Readiness","Information management; Awareness; Carbon emissions; CO2; Environmental footprints; Green IT; Readiness; Knowledge management",,,,,"Addressing the challenge of energy efficiency through Information and Communication Technologies (2008), http://www.euractiv.com/en/infosociety/brussels-launch-new-green-ict-plan/article-178747, Commission of the European Communities, EurActiv.

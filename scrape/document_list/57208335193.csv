A survey was conducted to collect data from 201 respondents. This study employed Cronbach Alpha to test the reliability and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to test the validity of the measurement items. Additionally, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that attitude towards packaging design has a significant and positive relationship toward perceived quality; perceived quality in turn has a significant and positive relationship with perceived value. Additionally, brand preference significantly and positively influence repurchases intention. However, attitude toward visual packaging design does not show any significant relationship toward brand preference and perceived value. Furthermore, perceived quality is found to insignificantly influence brand preference and repurchase intention. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Attitude; Brand preference; Candy products; Perceived quality; Perceived value; Repurchase intention; Visual packaging",,,,,,"Abdalkrim, G.M., Al-Hrezat, R.S., The role of packaging in consumers’ perception of product quality at the point of purchase (2013) EuropeanJournalofBusinessandManagement, 5 (4), pp. 69-82; Adam, M., Ali, K., Impact of packaging elements of packaged milk on consumer buying behaviour (2014) Cell, 312, p. 2093312; Agariya, A.K., Johari, A., Sharma, H.K., Chandraul, U.N., Singh, D., The role of packaging in brand communication (2012) International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, 3 (2), pp. 1-13; Ahmed, S., From customer perceived value to repurchase intention in the textile sector of Bangladesh: A correlation study (2014) International Journal of Ethics in Social Sciences, 2 (1), pp. 59-72; Bolton, R.N., Drew, J.H., A longitudinal analysis of the impact of service changes on customer attitudes (1991) Journal of Marketing, 55 (1), pp. 1-9; Chandrashekaran, R., The influence of redundant comparison prices and other price presentation formats on consumers’ evaluations and purchase intention (2004) Journal of Retailling, 80 (1), pp. 53-66; Choi, E.J., Kim, S., The study of the impact of perceived quality and value of social enterprises on customer satisfaction and repurchase intention (2013) International Journal of Smart Home, 7 (1), pp. 239-252; Chomvilailuk, R., Butcher, K., Enhancing brand preference through corporate social responsibility initiatives in the banking sector (2010) AsiaPacificJournalofMarketingandLogistics, 22 (3), pp. 397-418; Davis, K., Newsroom, J.W., (2006) Seri Ilmu Dan Manajemen Bisnis, , Jakarta, Indonesia: Elex Media computindo; De Bondt, W.F.M., Thaler, R., Does the stock market overreact?

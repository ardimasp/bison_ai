Until 2017, there are more than 1.173 cities around the world has implemented bike-sharing programs and with active bikers has reached around 1.9 million. The fast growth of bike sharing program globally, unfortunately, is not followed with its trend in Indonesia. Bike sharing idea is still new and hardly can be found in Indonesian cities. With the status of eighth largest of world economy in 2017, the bike sharing business is expected to grow along with global trend. The article examined the pilot project of bike sharing in one of well-known state universities in Indonesia to illustrate the feasibility of bike sharing business. The article applied mobile application with cloud computing paradigm and business model canvas (BMC) to illustrate the feasibility of bike sharing business. The outcome of the paper is expected to be used as reference for growing bike sharing business in Indonesia. © 2017 IEEE.","bike sharing program; business model canvas (BMC); cloud computing paradigm; mobile application","Application programs; Cloud computing; Environmental impact; Mobile cloud computing; Mobile computing; bike sharing program; Business modeling; Fast growths; Global trends; Indonesia; Mobile applications; Pilot projects; World economy; Bicycles",,,,,"Jifeng, W., Huapu, L.U., Hu, P., System dynamics model of urban transportation system and its application (2008) J.

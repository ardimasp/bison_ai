These factors which have major influences to the implementations of microservices containers are source code commit, merge source code, installed dependency, connection latency to master node, construction time. The results of test tests on published data for implementing microservices architecture show that using a regression model can find the level of influence of variables that exist during the implementation process as well as solve the issue. The factors that most influence the level of success of the implementation according to the trials carried out are merge source code, installed dependency, connection latency and construction time. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS","Container; Microservices Artitecture; Opendaylight",,,,,,"Alshuqayran, N., Ali, N., Evans, R., A systematic mapping study in microservice architecture (2016) IEEE 9th International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications; Waseem, M., Liang, P., Microservices architecture in DevOPs (2017) 24th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference Workshops; Kratzke, N., About microservices, containers and their underestimated impact on network performance (2015) Cloud Computing Conf, , 2015; Mironov, O., (2018) DevOps Pipeline with Docker, , Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, Thesis; Shadija, D., Rezai, M., Hill, R., Towards an understanding of microservices (2017) Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Automation & Computing, , University of Huddersfield, Huddersfield, UK, 7-8 September; Xiao, Z., Wijegunaratne, I., Australia, I., Qiang, X., Reflections on SOA and microservices (2016) 4th International Conference on Enterprise Systems",,,,"Little Lion Scientific",,,,,19928645,,,,"English","J.

This small-scale study surveyed 100 foreign tourists who visited Jakarta and stayed at least one night during the previous 12 months. The research employed cluster analysis to group foreign tourists with similar characteristics and preferences. Using a city branding hexagon as measurement variables, the results suggested there were three groups of foreign tourists with different characteristics and preferences during their visits in Jakarta. These are named On Duty Traveler, Deja Vu Traveler and New Face Traveler. The On Duty Traveler segment is the most dominant type of traveller, visiting Jakarta for working purposes and comprising travellers from the Asia-Pacific region. Understanding the differences between these three market segments and their demands provide the government with important information to inform Jakarta's City Branding and the creation of distinct marketing programs to appeal to each segment. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","City branding; City branding hexagon; Cluster analysis; Segmentation",,,,,,"The authors wish to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika journal team that help publish this article.","Blain, C., Levy, S.

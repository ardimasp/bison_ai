The purpose of this research was to determine the effects of temperature on stayed cable of the bridge, to analyze the contribution of pylon and girder stiffness to the cable tension forces variation due to temperature effect. The result of the analysis using Finite Element Method then compared with the available field measurement data. To validate the finite element model, the dynamic finite element model of the bridge will be compared with the dynamic properties of the bridge from dynamic testing of actual bridge. It was found from the finite element model that he effects of temperature on the cable force is linear and the girder and pylon stiffness has significant contribution to the variation of cable tension force due to temperature change. The different between field measurement and finite element model has been found due to assumption on the temperature behavior of bridge deck, pylon and cable © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

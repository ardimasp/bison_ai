The application is intended to help people with visual limitations or blind people to access Android-based devices so that they can use library resources by using android devices. Design/methodology/approach: The necessary data are collected from journals, articles, books and questionnaires, and similar applications are analyzed. The application design method used is the Scrum method, which consists of Backlog, Sprint and Scrum Meeting. From the operational side of the application, the method used is speech-to-text and text-to-speech. Findings: This application has been tried with some users who have total blindness and low vision, and all provided a good response to this application. From the performance side, the user gives a very satisfied response to this application. While the ease of using the application, the user also provides a satisfactory response to the ease of using this application. Research limitations/implications: The application still has limitations in penetration to the user, and the application is only built using Android as its platform. In addition, the dependence on libraries from Google has caused difficulties in implementing this application with local dialect, which is only understood by the local community. Social implication: This application has implications for the society, especially those with limitations in eyesight can be so much more productive and independent. This can reduce the social burden in society. Originality/value: This application provides an easy access of an android device to blind people and people with low vision, as well as access to library resources with devices that have been installed with this application. This facility can improve the library accessibility to the blind and visually challenged community. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Android; Application; Assistant; Blind; Mobile device; Speech; Text; Voice recognition",,,,,,"Bruegge, B., Dutoit, A.H., (2004) Object-Oriented Software Engineering Using UML, Patterns and Java-(Required) (Vol. 2004), , Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ; Craven, J., (2003) Access to electronic resources by visually impaired people; Epp, M.A., Closing the 95 percent gap: library resource sharing for people with print disabilities (2006) Library Trends, 54 (3), pp. 411-429; Lee, W.M., (2012) Beginning Android 4 Application Development, , John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ; Naone, E., TR10: intelligent software assistant - MIT technology review (2017) MIT Technology Review, , www2.technologyreview.com/news/412191/tr10-intelligent-software-assistant/, (accessed: 27 November 2017; Sutherland, J., Schwaber, K., (2011) The definitive guide to scrum: the rules of the game",,,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,07419058,,,,"English","Libr.

There were many research have been done in this area, but the issue is about the accuracy. From studies that have been done before, there are differences between the results of calculation using RSSl with the actual distance with the average of 1.6 meters. Our result indicate that when calculating the distance using optimization RSSl method, we can reduce the distance difference average value between Access Point (AP) and smartphone is 0.6 meters with an accuracy of 86.1%. Coordinate measurement using Pythagoras Theory also produce average of localization error valued of 0.6 meters. © 2016 IEEE.","Access Point; accuracy; RSSI; Wi-Fi","Smartphones; Wi-Fi; Access points; accuracy; Coordinate measurements; Distance-difference; Indoor environment; Localization errors; Received signal strength indicators; RSSI; Signal encoding",,,,,"Ma, S., Tang, Z., Xiao, Q., Liu, J., Duong, T.T., Lin, X., Detecting GPS information leakage in android applications (2013) Communication and Information System Security Symposium, p. 826; Zhang, L., Liu, J., Jiang, H., Guan, Y., Senstrack: Energy-efficient location tracking with smartphone sensors (2013) IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL, p. 3775; Lubbad, M.A., Alkurdi, M.Z., Samra, A.A., Robust indoor wi-fi positioning system for android-based smartphone (2013) International Journal of Research in Business and Technology, 3 (2); Cypriani, M., Lassabe, F., Canalda, P., Spies, F., (2009) Open Wireless Positioning System: A Wi-Fi-Based Indoor Positioning System, , Computer Science Laboratory of the University of Franche-Comte; Beom, J.S., Kwang, W.L., Sun, H.C., Joo, Y.K., Woo, J.L., Hyung, S.K., Indoor wifi positioning system for android-based smartphone (2010) IEEE; Okorogu, V., Oguejiofor, O., Adewale, A., Osuesu, B., Outdoor localization system using rssi measurement of wireless sensor network (2013) International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering (IJITEE), 2 (2); Mahiddin, N.A., Madi, E.N., Dhalila, S., Hasan, E.F., Safie, S., Safie, N., User position detection in an indoor environment (2013) International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering, 8 (5), pp. 303-312; Loy, M., Sylla, I., (2007) Fundamentals of ISM-Band and Short Range Device Antennas, Part 3, , http://www.eetimes.com/, http: //www. eetimes. com/document.

With its capability to create environment of connecting students with students, connecting student with teacher and giving the impactful learning resources, some of institution are dare to invest of expensive system. Hence, some of them keep searching for more efficient way to learning language. In this study, based on the previous research of REST Web Service as open content, proposed a Mobile Platform Based Language Laboratory on Web Service. With this idea, hopefully, a more fun language learning mobile environment can be created in the future. © 2014 H.

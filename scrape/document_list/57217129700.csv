Not only vehicle driving components, tyres also play a role in safety, passenger comfort, fuel consumption efficiency, endurance components of car legs and so forth. So, the condition of the tyre must receive special attention from the owner of a motorized vehicle. When riding on a motorcycle, tyre leakage is one of the problems that is often encountered. Not only because of sharp objects, tyres can also leak due to several other reasons. If problems are not immediately sought, leaks in tyres can cause loss of control, endangering the safety of motorists and other road users. And the place and timing of leakage events that cannot be predicted are often a scourge for motorists. After a leak, motorists, especially motorcycle riders, are very dependent on the existence of patched tyre entrepreneurs. With helps from IoT application based in advance, the design of this tool will be an opportunity for tyre patch entrepreneurs to be able to ""Pick Up the Ball"" to every customer/driver who has a leak. The design of this tool is quite concise and integrated thru Programmable Logic Control (PLC) with each main component making easier for entrepreneurs for patching tyres and can reduce downtime repair/replacement of the tyre. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Automatic Controller; Market opportunity; Motorcycle; Repair; Tyres",,,,,,"https://motorcyclesdata.com/2019/12/15/indonesia-motorcycles/, MotorcyclesData 2019; , pp. 7-14. , https://jakarta.bps.go.id, Biro Pusat Statistik Provinsi DKI Jakarta 2018 Statistik Transportasi DKI Jakarta 2018; Widowati, H., (2019), https://databoks.katadata.co.id/datapublish/2019/08/02/berapa-jumlah-kendaraan-di-dki-jakarta; Benidiktus, A., (2012) Perancangan Alat Press Tambal Ban Elektrik Dengan Pengatur Waktu Untuk Ban Dalam Sepeda Motor, pp. 1-2. , http://repository.upnyk.ac.id/4016/, (Yogyakarta: UPN ""Veteran"" Yogyakarta); Andrizal, (2003) Pembuatan Alat Tambal Ban Dalam (Benen) Kendaraan Semi Otomatis, pp. 15-16; Landschuetzer, C., Andreas, W., Simulation Potentialities for a Reciprocating Compressor (2010) Proceedings in Manufacturing Systems, 5, pp. 1-2; Quinonez-Varela, G., Cruden, A., Development of a Small-Scale Generator set model for Local Network Voltage and Frequency Stability Analysis (2007) IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 22 (2), pp. 368-372; Kay, B.B., Harmon, J.L., Twelve functions in a new digital meter (1969) Hewlett-Packard Journal, 20, pp. 2-13; Wulandari, D.C., Wildian, Rancang bangun ammeter DC tipe nondestructive berbasis mikrokontroler ATmega8535 dengan sensor efek hall ACS712 (2014) Jurnal Fisika Unand, 3, pp. 121-127; Bull, K., Thermocouples: Basic function and sources of error thermistors and thermocouples: Matching the tool to the task in thermal validation (2008) The Journal of Validation Technology, 14, pp. 73-76; Zhengyu, W., Xiaoyang, Y., Guanghui, L., Guangyu, T., Online cutting temperature measurement system based thermocouple (2014) International Journal of Control and Automation, 7 (10), pp. 355-364; Cengel, Y.A., (2003) Heat Transfer: A Practical Approach; Ortuño, M., Márquez, A., Gallego, S., Neipp, C., Beléndez, A., An experiment in heat conduction using hollow cylinders (2011) European Journal of Physics, 32 (4), pp. 1065-1075; (2015) Compressed Air Manual Book, pp. 20-22. , Atlas Copco Airpower N.V; Ashari, A., Mufarida, A., Efan, A., Analisis perpindahan panas pada alat tambal ban elektrik.

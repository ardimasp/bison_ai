This study focuses in to renew the application and evaluate the updated application for visually impaired children developed by utility Unity software. Besides, standards of good gamification are worthy of study and can increase the motivation to learn, and it only can happen if it meets the needs of the user. To achieve those goals, it has completed some development on several sections includes the homepage, input text, text size, and scoring. In this paper, System Usability Scale (SUS) is utilized, and some statistical model is conducted such as average, mean, Pearson-Product Moment correlation, T-test, and ANOVA. T-test results show that no difference between the partial and fully visually impaired participant, gender, and participants who used a similar application and not. The grades do not affect the SUS score, so it proved that the collected SUS score as average 75 is an objective result from the users although the average grade is 46. Moreover, both variable usability (0.884) and variable learnability (0.771) are positively correlated toward the System Usability Scale, notwithstanding variable usability and variable learnability is not correlated (0.383). The impact of this research can improve the industries especially the education field in Indonesia and some expectations from that result are included experience, knowledge, and skills of the users that need to be evaluated in further research. Hence, in the future, by using this application, we can increase the standard of living visually impaired people and enhance industry 4.0 in Indonesia. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

NLP and API.AI are some of the components that are crucial in making chatbot as they help chatbot in performing chatting operations. Chatbot could be implemented in many aspects of life such as education, social media platforms, games, even in business. Business has always been an important part of human life and it is irreplaceable. As the era evolves, the business industry is also getting modernized and automated which resulted in implementing the latest technology into the industry like chatbot. In the context of the business industry, chatbot can be used as an assistant that will help dealing with the customer service section as well as giving the latest information about the business. This study aims to determine how the chatbot gives impact to the business as well as the owners, what kind of features that the chatbot needs, and how the chatbot should be developed so that it will be compatible in the business environment. The research was conducted using two methods which are literature review and survey: questionnaire. The result of the research conducted are the impacts that the owner gets by using chatbot in their business, a set of features that are relevant in developing chatbot and recommendation for further implementation. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Dissemination of health information becomes a daunting task for the government. Data were collected from samples representing Indonesia, covering deaths throughout 2016, and at all deaths were verbal autopsies, according to World Health Organization guidelines in real time by doctors and trained personnel. From the data, it is seen that 10 types of diseases are the most common cause of death in Indonesia including cancer, cerebrovascular, and ischemic heart. But the information of 10 types of disease is still not common to the people of Indonesia. This research describes the design of a mobile application called 'I'm CARE'. The application is based on the 10 most dangerous diseases in Indonesia, as reported by the health information media. The research method used is data collection method that includes interviews with several specialist doctors. It also uses the method of analysis and database design that includes the design of the conceptual database, logical, and physical. Then using manual interaction computer to design user interface on mobile application and some machine learning models such as Decision Tree, k = Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The results achieved are the design of mobile-based application 'I'm CARE' model as a health information media about 10 diseases dangerous in Indonesia and prediction model of heart. The conclusion is that with the design of 'I'm CARE' mobile-based application model as health information media about 10 diseases dangerous disease in Indonesia and prediction model of heart hence dissemination of health information to Indonesian society can be improved and assist government in health area. © 2017 IEEE.","Health; Heart; I'm CARE; Mobile","Decision trees; Health; Heart; Information management; mHealth; Mobile computing; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Support vector machines; User interfaces; Application modeling; Data collection method; Health informations; Machine learning models; Mobile; Mobile applications; Mobile health application; World Health Organization; Information dissemination",,,,,"Statistik, B.P., (2014) Persentase Penduduk Daerah Perkotaan Menurut Provinsi, 2010-2035, , https://www.bps.go.id/linkTabelStatis/view/id/1276, [Online]; Utarini, A., Djasri, H., Keselamatan Pasien dan Mutu Pelayan Kesehatan: Menuju Kemana?

The process of applying gamification is included understanding the target audience and the context, defining learning objectives, structuring the experience, identify resources, and applying gamification elements. Some typing applications for visually impaired people are consuming braille, touchscreen, and delivered in English. As for some educational-based gamified applications have not supported typing for the blind children especially in Indonesia. Therefore, in this contribution, a novel gamified application for typing is presented. Moreover, this application is delivered in Indonesian language. As a material for typing, this application consumes questions based on the curriculum applied in Indonesia. This model is developed with utilized the Game Development Life Circle (GDLC) method which includes initialization, pre-production, production, testing, and release. The application has been tested on several respondents. The respondents believe that this application is valuable, easy to use, and easy to understand. © 2017 The Authors.

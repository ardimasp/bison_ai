In order to maintain the healthcare sector in Industrial Revolution 4.0, smart contracts are used to provide those addresses which provide transparent ways to do transactions among entities. In the other hand, the adoption has challenges, such as the adoption curve, the complexity of the business ecosystems and standardization, data privacy, and people expectations in the healthcare industry. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

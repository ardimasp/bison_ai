The instrument used is a USE Questionnaire to obtain user satisfaction data. Atisa Dipamkara High School has been using an online application system to process the Students Grade. The application system is a web-based information system to assist the process of making the student reports every semester. This paper discusses the method of measuring the level of use of the application of student grade processing in Atisa Dipamkara High School. One factor in measuring the quality of an information system is usability. Usability level refers to the ease of use of such information systems or software. The higher the usability value means the higher the benefits of the information system in helping the users. This measurement of usability is using USE Questionnaire consisting of 3 parameters namely benefits (usefulness), ease to use and ease to learn. Data collection involves 25 teachers as user respondents of this information system. The result of usability measurement will have the value of «feasibility» and proof that there is significant influence between usefulness variable, ease to use and ease to learn to user satisfaction variable. © 2018 The Authors.

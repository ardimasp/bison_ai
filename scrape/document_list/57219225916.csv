Smart sleep monitoring systems have become a solution to tackle this problem, where the system needs to be accessible at any time and condition by multiple users bringing the needs of the high availability and throughput of the system. Containerization has become a trending topic in software development where the container concept has solved many problems of virtual machines such as cost reduction, fewer CPU needed, and CPU utilization has been improved. Many containers have been around since then, and the most famous widely used is Docker. With its extra lightweight, fast, and highly portable characteristics, docker can be run anywhere on all platforms like Linux and Windows distribution. There are so many container orchestrations that can be used to manage docker containers, such as Swarm, Kubernetes, and Nomad. The purpose of this research is to propose Kubernetes as the container orchestration for the implementation in the real-life scenario. The result shows us that Kubernetes gives a good result in availability, flexibility, and scalability compared to the other container orchestration in developing and delivering products. © ICIC International 2020.","Container; Container orchestration; Internet of Things; Kubernetes; Sleep monitoring",,,,,"039/VR","Acknowledgment.

This certainly affects self-productivity and work productivity in the office / business. With the establishment of the Money Diary application, it is expected to become a solute task and money management application. The purpose of making this application is to assist users in managing and managing their tasks and finances all at once in an application. The research method used in data collection is literature study and indirect observation. The application development method uses the system development life cycle method with the waterfall model. This model uses a systematic and sequential approach that starts at the level of requirement to the level of maintenance. This application is based on Android developed with the Java programming language. The result is a money diary application that can be used to daily actions, to remind users of the need to pay bills on time, to facilitate financial management for users, to remind users to perform certain actions that were previously planned. © 2020 IEEE.","Android; Mobile application; Money diary; System development life cycle","Computer programming; Finance; Information management; Life cycle; Productivity; Application development; Application models; Financial managements; Literature studies; research methods; Sequential approach; System development life cycles; Work productivity; Android (operating system)",,,,,"(2018) Success in Disruptive Times|Expanding the Value Delivery Landscape to Address the High Cost of Low Performance, , P.

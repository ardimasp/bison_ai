Those include the Banks with category IV. In many cases, the companies recruit the most talented person and continue to initiate training to improve the current resources capabilities and competencies. This research evaluated the impact of the recruitment of a higher level of education person, training costs, and investment of corporate assets, to the performance of the company. This research used secondary longitudinal data in the period between 2011 until 2015. The calculations of data and research model analysis used SPSS version 19 and WarpPLS software. This study concluded that training and asset development had a significant influence on company performance. Therefore, evaluation on training cost allocation to improve the competency and capacity of the company becomes one of the important indicators for the sustainability of the company's performance, especially with today's business disruption by information technology as a key challenge in the bank industry. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Competition; Education; Indonesia Bank Type IV; RBT; Resource development",,,,,,"The authors wish to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika journal team that help in publishing this article.","Ahmadi, S.

It also aimed to examine the relationship between EO and student inclination toward entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional survey was conducted targeting students at Indonesian universities. Using a pilot sample of 65 students, the authors developed their hypotheses. Thereafter, based on a sample of 381 students, the hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. Findings - The findings revealed that EO in the Indonesian context was a three- factor instrument consisting of the three dimensions: risk-taking, innovativeness and proactiveness. Moreover, the findings showed there is a positive relationship between EO and Entrepreneurial Intention (EI) among business students at Indonesian universities. Practical implications - Given the imperative need for universities to monitor and improve the entrepreneurial spirit among business students, this study can help business students to understand better regarding the business attitude they need to maintain, which can help them to improve proactive personality and formulate effective business strategies in the future. Originality/value - This paper came to be one of the first studies that attempted to assess the EO among business student in Indonesia using AMOS-SEM. Additionally, this study pioneered through drawing a factorial picture for EO in the Indonesian context.","Business studentsr; Entrepreneurial intention; Entrepreneurial orientation; Structural equation modeling",,,,,,,"Amrullah, A., (2012) Mayoritas Lulusan Perguruan Tinggi tak Tertarik Jadi Wirausahawan, Kok Bisa?, , http://www.republika.co.id/berita/nasional/umum/12/03/03/m0aira-mayoritas-lulusan-perguruan-tinggi-tak-tertarik-jadi-wirausahawan-kok-bisa, Accessed 13 May 2015; (2015) Jumlah pengangguran terbuka Indonesia 7,24 juta, , http://nasional.kontan.co.id/news/jumlah-pengangguran-terbuka-indonesia-724-juta, Accessed 13 May 2015; (2015) Jumlah Pengusaha Indonesia Hanya 1,65 Persen, , http://www.republika.co.id/berita/nasional/umum/15/03/12/nl3i58-jumlah-pengusaha-indonesia-hanya-165-persen, Accessed 13 May 2015; (2013) Sekjen Kemenakertrans Muchtar LuthfiMembuka Forum Inkubator Bisnis Asia Pasific di Bandung, , http://bbppk-lembang.com/view_news_detail-152-sekjen-kemenakertrans-muchtar-luthfi-membuka-forum-inkubator-bisnis-asia-pasific-di-bandung.aspx, Accessed 25 May 2015; Astuti, D.A.W., (2009) Pengaruh Konteks Keluarga, Kerja, Pendidikan, Hambatan Dalam Memulai Bisnis, Dukungan Sosial, Nilai-Nilai Individualisme dan Kolektivisme Pada Intensi Berwirausaha, , working paper, Management Department, Universitas Sebelas Maret, 19 October; Begley, T.M., Boyd, D.P., Psychological Characteristics Associated with Performance in Entrepreneurial Firms and Smaller Businesses (1987) Journal of Business Venturing, 2 (1), pp. 79-93; Bentler, P., Comparative fit indexes in structural models (1990) Psychological Bulletin, 107 (2), pp. 238-246; Bentler, P., (2005) EQS 6 Structural Equations Program Manual, , Multivariate Software, Encino, CA; Bentler, P.M., Bonett, D.G., Significance tests and goodness of fit in the analysis of covariance structures (1980) Psychological Bulletin, 88 (3), pp. 588-606; Bolton, D.L., Lane, M.D., Individual entrepreneurial orientation: development of a measurement instrument (2012) Education + Training, 54 (2-3), pp. 219-233; Brislin, R.W., Translation and content analysis of oral and written materials (1980) Triandis: Handbook of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 2. , J.

Mudharabah financing is known to be suitable for small business financing, but requires collateral as one of the financing conditions to the sharia bank which is always a barrier for Small and Medium Enterprises in obtaining financing. The alternative model built to be used in financing this small business combines Mudharabah and Musyarakah concepts, and is called The Rotating Multiple Wheels Management Model. This model involves small and medium-sized businesses, but does not require collateral for avoiding all risks of Mudharabah Financing, namely: (i) Side Stream Risk, (ii) Neglect Risk, (iii) Manipulation Risk. This model can be used by banks in assisting the development of financing to Small and Medium Enterprises by minimizing risk to the minimum level, while also facilitating Small and Medium Enterprises in obtaining bank financing without collateral. However, this study does not examine the morale of parties involved in the financing process to small and medium-sized businesses so that the failure of financing due to moral hazard is not included in this model. © 2017 Serials Publications Pvt.

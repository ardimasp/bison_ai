Youtube as the number 1 social media in Indonesia, has an important role as a promotional strategy media for beauty products. Research design, data and methodology: This study used the online survey to 210 female respondents aged 17-30 years who became a subscriber of an Indonesian beauty influencer. Simple regression and multiple regressions were performed to analyze the independent variables towards the dependent variable. Results: The results show that social media influencer, electronic word of mouth, and perceived quality simultaneously have a significant influence on purchase intention. Nevertheless, only two variables individually have a significant influence on purchase intention, which is social media influencer and perceived quality. Conclusions: Perceived quality and social media influencer could be the best strategies to increase consumers when promoting through the influencer's Youtube channel by utilizing a subscriber. While e-WOM can be influential on other social media platforms rather than on the Youtube platform. Therefore, suggested that digital marketer must use multiple social media platforms to increase consumers' purchase intention. © The Author(s).","Electronic word of mouth; Perceived quality; Purchase intention; Social media influencer; Youtube",,,,,"Binus University","* This Reasearch was financially supported by Bina Nusantara University.","Asshidin, N.H.N., Abidin, N., Borhan, H.B., Perceived Quality and Emotional Value that Influence Consumer's Purchase Intention towards American and Local Products (2016) Procedía Economics and Finance, 55 (2016), pp. 639-643. , https://doi.org/10.1016/s2212-5671(16)00078-2; Awad, N.F., Ragowsky, A., Establishing trust in electronic commerce through online word of mouth: An examination across genders (2008) Journal of Management Information Systems, 24 (4), pp. 101-121; Bou-Llusar, J., Camison-Zornoza, C., Escrig-Tena, A.B., Measuring the relationship between firm perceived quality and customer satisfaction and its influence on purchase intentions (2001) Journal of Total Quality Management, 12 (6), pp. 719-734; Brown, J., Broderick, A.J., Lee, N., Word of Mouth Communication Within Online Communities: Conceptualizing the Online Social Network (2007) Journal of Interactive Marketing, 21 (3), pp. 2-20. , https://doi.org/10.1002/dir.20082; Cheng, L.P., Effects of Brand Image, Perceived Price, Perceived Quality, and Perceived Value on the Purchase Intention towards Sports and Tourism Products of the 2016 Taichung International Travel Fair (2017) The Journal of International Management Studies, 12 (2), pp. 97-107; Cheung, M.Y., Luo, C., Sia, C.L., Chen, H., Credibility of electronic word-of-mouth: Informational and normative determinants of on-line consumer recommendations (2009) International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 13 (4), pp. 9-38; de Veirman, M., Marketing through Instagram influencers: The impact of number of followers and product divergence on brand attitude (2017) International Conference on Research Om Advertising (ICORIA) 2016, 36 (5), pp. 798-828; Durmaz, A., Yüksel, M., The Effect of Ewom on Purchase Intention: Evidence From E-Commerce Sites Ağizdan Ağlletişimin Satin AlmNiyetinEtkisi: ETicareSiteleriŪzerineBir Araştirma (2017) Suleyman Demirel University The Journal of Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences Y, 22 (1), pp. 231-239. , http://iibfdergi.sdu.edu.tr/assets/uploads/sites/352/files/yil-2017-cilt-22-sayi-1-yazi19-18022017.pdf, Retrieved from; Erkan, I., Evans, C., The influence of eWOM in social media on consumers' purchase intentions: An extended approach to information adoption (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, 61 (2016), pp. 47-55. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2016.03.003; Goyette, I., Ricard, L., Bergeron, J., Marticotter, F., E-WOM Scale: Word of-Mouth Measurement Scale for eServices Context (2010) Canadian Journal of Administrative Sciences, 27 (1), pp. 5-23; Ha, N.M., Lam, N.H., The Effects of Celebrity Endorsement on Customer's Attitude toward Brand and Purchase Intention (2016) International Journal of Economics and Finance, 9 (1), pp. 64-77. , https://doi.org/10.5539/ijef.v9n1p64; Henricks, M., (1998) Spread the Word, Entrepreneur, , 26(6), 120125; Heriyati, S., Effects of word of mouth communication and perceived quality on decision making moderated by gender: Jakarta blackberry smartphone consumer's perspective (2011) Contemporary Management Research, 7 (4), pp. 329-336; Hui, T.X., The Effect of source credibility on consumers' purchase intention in Malaysia online community (2017) Journal of Arts and Social Sciences, 1 (1), pp. 12-20; Jamil, R.A., Influence of Celebrity Endorsement on Consumer Purchase Intention for Existing Products: A Comparative Study (2014) Journal of Management Info, 4(1), 1-23; Kamins, M.A., An Investigation into the ""Match-up"" Hypothesis in Celebrity Advertising: When Beauty May Be Only Skin Deep (1990) Journal of Advertising, 19 (1), pp. 4-13; Kotler, P., Keller, K.K., (2016) Marketing Managemen, , (15th ed.).

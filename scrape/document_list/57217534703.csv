All this time, services require the content provider to register the copyright to the marketplace or third party. With the existence of blockchain technology makes it possible for the customer to control their data, the available blockchain technology is Smart Contract. Smart Contracts enables instant payment without delay, without obstacles, and without a third party (mediator) which are performed in a decentralized network. Based on the reasons above, this paper will be focusing on a discussion about the smart contract blockchain on digital video streaming application by creating design a streaming video platform with a decentralized peer-to-peer concept. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

In 2004, the government of Indonesia introduced PSAs-government agencies that were given large autonomy to manage their financial affairs. The rationale behind this autonomy is consistent with the New Public Management ideal: The creation of more market-oriented government institutions with the objective of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of public service delivery. The PSA policy has increased state revenues significantly, yet the quality of services and accountability has not improved accordingly. A comparison with SOEs reveals that the restructuring of government agencies and SOEs took place before a supportive framework was set in place. We argue that to tackle informality and to safeguard the social functions of public services, the spearheads of efficiency and revenues in Indonesian bureaucratic reform policies require a strong foundation, consisting of regulatory and ideological components. © 2020 by Shidarta and Stijn Cornelis van Huis.","Economic; Indonesia; Policy; Public service agencies; Restructuring; State-owned enterprises (soes)",,,,,,"Ambariani, A.S., Hospital financial performance in the Indonesian national health insurance era (2014) Review of Integrative Business and Economic Research, 4 (1), pp. 367-379. , http://e-journal.uajy.ac.id/17742/, accessed 28-10-2019; Bel, G., Esteve, M., Is private production of hospital services cheaper than public production?

This is due to different reasoning methods. The legal consideration approach to judex facti decisions, in verifying facts as norms, is performed lexically. The way the judge's logic works is by using deductive logic and verifying the facts of the defendant's actions to normalise elements that are merely restrictive. The judex juris decisions of judges and the judex facti legal judgments understand the act of participation in corruption case by using an inductive reasoning method. Judex juris decisions examine judex facti legal considerations by determining the major premise more extensively. Judges search for the legal principles underlying norms to verify the facts of the defendant's condition. The results of the verification and the conclusion of judex juris state that the defendant's actions are proven but there are no faults. Thus, judex facti decisions are cancelled and it is decided that the defendant is free from all legal charges. © Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Corruption crime; Judge decision; Legal reasoning",,,,,,"(2019), https://id.mwikipedia.org, (n.d.).

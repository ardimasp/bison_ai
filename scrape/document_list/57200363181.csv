The approach used in this research is a qualitative research approach with the type of descriptive explorative research. The model produced by this research involves five groups of stakeholder, namely government, society, private sector/industry, media and scientists. The role of the five stakeholders is mapped in three types of stakeholders, namely key stakeholders primary stakeholders and secondary stakeholders. Disaster preparedness logistics activities in this research are divided into four activities, namely facility location, stock prepositioning, resource allocation, and relief distribution, while the collaboration indicators set in this research are partnership, participation and network. The mapping of stakeholders and the formulation of stakeholders collaboration models in this research was carried out by the FGD (Focus Group Discussion) process, which consisted of representatives from all groups of stakeholder.The concept model obtained from this paper can be used as a basis for the preparation of the blueprint of the National Logistics System for Disaster Management in Indonesia that can help disaster management actors collaborate in carrying out logistics activities in disaster preparedness, so that logistical activities in disaster preparedness can be carried out quickly, precise and accurate. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Disaster Logistics; Disaster Preparedness; Logistics; Stakeholder Collaborative","Disaster prevention; Logistics; Mapping; Collaboration models; Disaster management; Disaster preparedness; Facility locations; Logistical activities; Qualitative research; Relief distribution; Stakeholder Collaborative; Disasters",,,,,,"UNISDRU Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 (2015) United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction Geneva; Fairuza, M., (2016) Kolaborasi Antar Stakeholders Dalam Pembangunan Inklusif Pada Sektor Pariwisata (Studi Kasus Wisata Pulau Merah di Kabupaten Banyuwangi); Bryson, J.M., What to do when stakeholders matter: A guide to stakeholder identification and analysis techniques (2003) London School of Economics and Political Science, p. 10; (2009) Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction, , UNISDRG; O'Brien, G., O'Keefe, P., Gadema, Z., Swords, J., Approaching disaster management through social learning (2010) Disaster Prevention and Management: An International Journal, 19 (4), pp. 498-508; Rodríguez-Espíndola, O., Albores, P., Brewster, C., Disaster preparedness in humanitarian logistics: A collaborative approach for resource management in floods (2018) European Journal of Operational Research, 264 (3), pp. 978-993; Ishiwatari, M., Flood risk governance: Establishing collaborative mechanism for integrated approach (2019) Progress in Disaster Science, 2",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

There are three occurrences of a devastating earthquake that once rocked Jakarta which damaged several houses and tall buildings and permanently stone walls. Conceptual and implementation readiness is needed when a major earthquake occurs, especially in terms of inspections of building structure capabilities, public education, and contingency plans that are in accordance with the conditions of the people of Jakarta. This research aims to build a conceptual framework for the readiness of Jakarta society through various approaches. The conceptual framework will be the theoretical basis of earthquake disaster profiling and disaster mitigation-based spatial planning. The study was conducted on exploratory research as part of the Neuroresearch research method. The results of the study were in the form of theoretical constructs of the study of socio-cultural ecology to realize the spatial layout of Jakarta residential areas based on earthquake mitigation. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","earthquake mitigation; socio-cultural ecology; urban planning","Disasters; Ecology; Tall buildings; Urban planning; Building structure; Conceptual frameworks; Disaster mitigation; Earthquake disaster; Earthquake mitigations; Exploratory research; Historical records; Socio-cultural; Earthquakes",,,,"Binus University","This work is partially supported by Research Interest Group in Educational Technology, Bina Nusantara University.

Prevention efforts will be realized when everyone has awareness and preparedness for the disaster itself. For architects, preparedness to face an earthquake is important because it can be felt in the implementation of their work that is utilized by the community. This study wants to see Architect's Earthquake Readiness as a measurement of how responsive architects are in preparing for disasters in their work. The research method is Neuroresearch method with survey techniques.

Through this analysis, the development of an area can be intervened in a planned manner. Morphology can be a valuable tool by linking technological aspects to urban sustainability strategies with various aspects of culture, social, civil through urban architectural design. This tool can be used in accordance with comprehensive and complex sustainability ideas that can only be achieved fully through the renewal of public awareness and the use of available resources. Architecture and language (linguistics) have a basic resemblance, where both are tools for conveying messages, radiating impressions and as objects to capture impressions and messages. Likewise, in understanding the form, both have the same similarity. The form of the two fields of science is studied in morphology. Morphology of the city learn the intricacies of urban space form and function changes the shape of urban space, both functions of grammatical and semantic functions. The smallest element of linguistics is morpheme, the smallest element of architecture urban is the space, so morpheme can be analogical into the space (morpheme = space).

Changes in road network patterns will have an impact on the permeability of the area. Permeability measures the extent to which road network patterns provide an option in traveling. If the permeability increases the travel distance decreases and the route of travel choice increases, permeability like this can create an easy access system and physically integrated. This study aims to identify the relationship of physical characteristics of residential area and road network pattern to the level of space permeability in Bojonggede area. By conducting this research can be a reference for the arrangement of circulation, accessibility, and land use in the vicinity of Bojonggede. This research uses quantitative method and space syntax method to see global integration and local integration on the region which become the parameter of permeability level. The results showed that the level of permeability globally and locally high in Bojonggede physical area is the physical characteristics of the area that has a grid pattern of road network grid. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","accessibility; road network pattern; space syntax method; sustainable transportation","Land use; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Syntactics; accessibility; Permeability increase; Physical characteristics; Physical structures; Road network; Space syntax; Sustainable transportation; Unplanned settlements; Transportation",,,,,,"Black, J., (1981) Urban Transport, Planning Theory and Practise, , (London: Croom); Suwardjoko, W., (1990) Merencanakan Sistem Perangkutan, , (Bandung: ITB); Bentley, I., (1985) Responsive Environments, , (London: Routledge); Carmona, (2003) Publics Space Urban Space, , (London: Architectural Press London); Trancik, R., (1986) Finding Lost Space Theories Urban Design, , (New York: Van Nostrand Reindhold Co); Zahnd, M., (1999) Perancangan Kota Secara Terpadu: Teori Perancangan Kota Dan Penerapannya, , (Semarang: Kanisius); Marshall, S., (2005) Street & Pattern, , (New York: Spon Press); Hillier, B., (2015) Space Is the Machine: A Configurational Theory of Architecture, , (London: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform); Siregar, P., (2014) Metodologi Dasar Space Syntax Dalam Analisis Konfigurasi Ruang, , (Malang: Jurusan Perencanaan Wilayah dan Kota Fakultas Teknik Universitas Brawijaya)",,"Kasih T.P.","","Institute of Physics Publishing","International Conference on Eco Engineering Development 2017, ICEED 2017","14 November 2017 through 15 November 2017",,133427,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The concept of Jakarta socio-cultural ecology architecture is characterized by residential development capabilities that reflect and express the indigenous culture, the settlements built by linking the social and economic activities of the people of Jakarta and the settlements built by maintaining the building with the value of existing heritage. The objectives of this research are 1) to find a relevant construct to housing condition in Jakarta which then called Jakarta socio-cultural ecology, and 2) to see the tendency of complex condition of Jakarta socio-cultural ecology settlement. This research uses Neuroresearch method, which is one of mix-method research method as a mixture research method between qualitative research (exploration) and quantitative research method (explanatory and confirmatory). The population of research as well as unit analysis are all settlements in Jakarta. Sampling technique using probability sampling that is with multistage sampling. The results show that nowadays the Jakarta residential complex tends to lead to socio-cultural ecology and rather reflects and expresses the indigenous culture, the residential complex in Jakarta tends to form the building has been linked fully with the social and economic activities of Jakarta society but tends to occasionally maintain buildings with existing heritage values. This study also found that indigenous culture is a significant determinant of the formation of the condition of Jakarta socio-cultural ecology. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","socio-cultural ecology; sustainable architecture; sustainable settlement; urban neighbourhood","Architecture; Economics; Housing; Neighbourhood; Quantitative research methods; Residential complexes; Residential development; Settlement development; Socio-cultural; Sustainable architecture; Sustainable settlements; Ecology",,,,,,"Susilo, Y.O., Joewono, T.B., A reflection of motorization and public transport in Jakarta metropolitan area: Lessons learned and future implications towards better transportation development in developing countries (2007) Proceedings of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies, 6; Steinberg, F., Jakarta: Environmental problems and sustainability (2007) Habitat International, 31 (3-4), pp. 354-365; Hudalah, D., Firman, T., Beyond property: Industrial estates and post- suburban transformation in Jakarta metropolitan region (2012) Cities, 29 (1), pp. 40-48; Agustiananda, P.A.P., Urban Heritage Conservation in Surakarta, Indonesia Scenarios and Strategies for the Future (2012) Int.

The theory of planned behaviour explains the possible reason(s) why the employee is reluctant to invest in retail bonds. This study sheds light by adding the product involvement variable to the original model to identify the intention to spend and what the factors are those are influencing it. As predicted, attitude and subjective norm are positively related to the intention to invest in retail bonds. Based on the results of data processing, it was found that the attitude and subjective norm variables are factors that positively and significantly affect the intentions of ORI investment by IDX employees. Also, the results of data processing showed that intention had a significant effect on the investment behaviour of ORI by IDX employees. This study is limited to discussing the intentions of ORI investment by IDX employees, making it possible for other researchers to examine different variables. © 2020 Mery Kusuma Dewi and Dewi Tamara.","Intention to invest; Planned behavior; Product involvement; Retail bonds",,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., The Theory of Planned Behaviour: Organizational Behaviour and Human Decision Processes (1991), 50, pp. 179-211. , https://doi.org/10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T, Retrieved from; Ajzen, I., (2005) Attitudes, Personality and Behavior, , New York: Open University Press; Ajzen, I., Consumer attitudes and Behavior: The Theory of Planned Behavior Applied to Food Consumption Decisions (2015) Rivista di Economia Agraria, 70 (2), pp. 121-138. , http://dx.doi.org/10.13128/REA-18003, Retrieved from; Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., (1980) Understanding attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Alleyne, P., Broome, T., Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour and Risk Propensity to Measure Investment Intentions among Future Investors (2011) Journal of Eastern Caribbean Studies, 36 (1), pp. 1-20. , https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299483632-Using-the-theory-of-planned-behaviour-and-risk-propensity-to-measure-investment-intentions-among-future-investors, Retrieved from; Ali, S., Zani, R.M., Kasim, K., Factors Influencing Investors Behavior in Islamic Unit Trust: An Application of Theory of Planned Behavior (2014) Journal of Islamic Economics, Banking & Finance, 10 (2), pp. 183-201. , https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ac9f/0ae2fafd13635b28cccff8aba99be7cf357e.pdf, Retrieved from; (2010) Prosedur Penelitian Suatu Pendekatan Praktek, , Arikunto.

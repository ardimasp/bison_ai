Analytics include the ability to get different point of view from data by manipulating the data using statistics, mathematics, economics, simulations, optimizations, or other techniques that will enhance decision making of business organizations. BD is led by the widespread use of digital technologies in companies in various sectors, including Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company. The amount of data produced and communicated in is piled up everyday. Data in database include items sold, store inventory, and warehouse inventory of retail partner for specific stock keeping units (SKUs) produced by the manufacturer. These records called Point-of-Sale (POS) data. In modern days dynamic consumer markets, supply chains need to be value driven and consumer oriented. Demand planning allows supply chain members to focus on the consumer and create optimal value. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

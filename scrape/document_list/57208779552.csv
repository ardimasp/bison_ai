In Indonesia alone, the issue of cyber security is certainly closely related to technological growth. In 2018 as many as 83.19% of Indonesia’s population are active internet users and as many as 26.26% of Indonesia’s population are smartphone users. When viewed positively, the use of technological developments can facilitate data collection so that existing data or information can be reused for interests that can benefit both organizations and individuals. This study aims to find out what factors influence smartphone users to open their personal information and provide access to mobile applications. These factors have been examined previously by Benson et al [1], which consists of 4 factors, namely Control Over Personal Information, Use of Information, and Privacy Notice that affect Information Disclosure, and using questionnaire techniques with 101 respondents. From the results obtained, it was found that the Personal Control Over, Use of Information, and Privacy Notice are the influential factors for individuals to open their information or not. In addition, when users know the function of information that is opened and get privacy notifications in advance, smartphone users will tend to open their personal information and give permissions to either mobile platforms or mobile applications to access personal information. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Control; Information disclosure; Privacy notice; Smartphone; Use of information",,,,,,"Benson, V., Saridakis, G., Tennakoon, H., Information disclosure of social media users (2015) Inf.

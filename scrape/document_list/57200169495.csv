Traditionally, it is used by customers inside the store to transport goods to the cashier during shopping and designed not to leave the store. It is an inconvenience and time wasted for customers who want to find the desired product in the store by using the traditional shopping trolley. Our goal is to develop an automatic moving trolley with smart shopping devices to solve the problem. Our smart shopping trolley is based on a two-wheeled mobile robot, developed in our previous research. This paper presents the hardware and software design of a smart trolley system. Our smart trolley used IOIO microcontroller and Android smartphone as sensors and controller. The trolley is modeled as a two-wheeled mobile robot. Android smartphone will control the robot by sending a signal to IOIO microcontroller paired with a robot's actuator and monitor the situation using the smartphone camera. Furthermore, we exploited the smartphone compass for robot navigation. This system is also equipped with the indoor positioning system to detect user position using Navisens which based on gyroscope and accelerometer in the smartphone. Finally, the results of the testing on robot navigation are presented. The result is our smart trolley system based on Navisens framework can move and show its location to the user. © 2019 The Authors.

BSS is a problem of separation of several speech signals in a real world from mono or stereo audio record. In this research, we implement BSP system using DUET algorithm which allow to separate any number of sources by using only stereo (two) mixtures. The DUET (Degenerate Unmixing Estimation Technique) algorithm replaces our previous FastICA (Fast Independent Component Analysis) method only success in simulation but failed in the implementation. The main problem of FastICA is that it assumes instantaneous mixing without time delay in the recording process. To deals with audio record in the presence of inevitable time delays, it has to be replaced with DUET algorithm to separate well in real time. Finally, the DUET algorithm is implemented to humanoid robot which is developed using Raspberry Pi and equipped with RaspPi Cam to detect human face. Furthermore, the Cirrus Logic Audio Card is stacked to Raspberry Pi in order to record stereo audio. In our experiments, there are three controlled variables to evaluate algorithm performance, that is: distance, number of sources, and subject's name. Robot will record stereo audio for four seconds after face is detected by system. The recording is then separated by DUET algorithm and produce two source estimations with average computation time 1.8 seconds. With Google API, the recognition accuracy of separated speech is varying between 40%-70%. © 2017 The Authors.

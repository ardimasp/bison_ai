The study was conducted for 3 weeks at an elementary school in West Jakarta. 40 students that involved in the study were divided into 2 classes. Each class consists of 20 children, and each of them labeled as control class and experiment class. The instrument was a 10 item test that developed from scientific literacy indicators PISA 2015. Data processing was carried out in two ways, first statistically test used to see the significance of difference in scientific literacy achievement from both class control and experiment. Wilcoxon test on both class normalized gain showed signif icance of 0.004 which is smaller than the normal level α = 0.005 which means that the hypothesis was accepted, where the integration on STEM education could significantly improve students' scientific literacy. In addition, a qualitative analysis also conducted to get deeper understanding of students' improvement. The result shows that students who studied with the integration of STEM education have improved the quality of answering questions and provide a better explanation than the students who study with common project-based study. © 2019, IJSTR.","Elementary Students; Index Terms: STEM Education; Scientific literacy",,,,,,,"(2016) OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-Operation Development; Vieira, R.D., Melo, V.F., Avraamidou, L., Lobato, J.A., Reconceptualizing scientific literacy: The role of students’ epistemologycal profiles (2017) MDPI Educ Sci; Snow, A.E., Dibner, K.A., Science Literacy: Concepts, Contexts, and Consequences, , National Academy Press: Washington, DC, 2016; Ogunkola, B.J., Scientific Literacy: Conceptual overview, Importance, and strategies for improvement (2013) JESR, 3, pp. 265-274. , vol , January, pp; (1996) National Research Council (NRC), , National Education Standards; National Academy Press: Washington, DC; Firman, H., (2014) Pendidikan Sains Berbasis STEM: Konsep, , Pengembangan. dan peranan riset pascasarjana.

Experimental research was conducted for four weeks with learning using e-learning media as an experimental group (n = 32) and using book-based learning as a control group (n = 30). This study used a quasi-experimental method with a pretest and posttest control group design. The research instrument was taken from observations and scores on student learning outcomes. The data were analyzed using a quantitative statistical method. Based on data, the researchers know that a teacher plays an essential role in developing student learning media through ICT based learning design. Also, the results of the study based on Mann-Whitney N-gain score of students’ comprehension ability obtained a significance value of 0.00 less than α = 0.05 so that H0 was rejected. This result shows that the ability of students to understand sci ence using e-learning media is significantly better than students who get book-based learning. © International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

The teacher's challenge is to select and use learning models that are appropriate to the needs of the 21st-century students. This study offers the application of collaborative learning models from Flipped Classroom and Jigsaw which are expected to develop the character of students at the elementary level in Jakarta. The model is the answer to the problems of students living in a rapidly evolving technology era and requires an active, creative, and collaborative learning model. The research design and data collection techniques used the Pre-experimental Design model with One Group Pretest-Posttest Study by observing and measuring the students' attitude over a period of time using character observation sheets, then the results were analyzed using descriptive percentage analysis to confirm or reject the initial hypothesis, answering research questions, and drawing conclusions. The research finds that teachers play an important role in developing the character of students through the design and model of learning used, the growth of the character of the treated class students are higher than the untreated class so that the value of the characters in the treated class in the category of very good and entrenched, the N-gain score average of the treated class is higher than that of the untreated class but the difference is not significant. Students also report on the positive impact of technology utilization and improvement of skills gained on learning using flipped classroom and jigsaw models. © 2018 IEEE.","character; flipped classroom; jigsaw; learning models","Educational technology; Teaching; character; Collaborative learning model; Design and modeling; Flipped classrooms; jigsaw; Learning models; Research questions; Technology utilization; Students",,,,,,"Goda, Y., Yamada, M., Hata, K., Matsukawa, H., Yasunami, S., Effects of flipped jigsaw collaborative classroom on english as a foreign language classroom anxiety (2017) Emerging Technologies for Education.

The result of the treatment of Positive Discipline Method, Which was done in six weeks produced a considerable effect on students’ self regulatory skills and interpersonal skills.

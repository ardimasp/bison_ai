A field experiment was conducted in Jakarta to 240 respondents. The data was collected using 2×2×2 between subject factorial designs. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's Post Hoc test were employed to analyze the significant different between research variables. For parent brands: celebrity endorser credibility does not increase brand awareness, brand association but it increases perceived quality of brand with high credibility. Meanwhile, celebrity endorser credibility increases awareness but it does not increase brand association and perceived quality of brand with low credibility. For sub-brands: celebrity endorser credibility of sub-brand of highly credible brand only increases brand awareness of the sub-brand but it does not increase brand awareness, brand association and perceived quality of both sub-brands with high and low credibility. The role of celebrity endorser has important role in increasing awareness of brands with low credibility, so that celebrity endorser can be considered as effective marketing tools for new brand in the market. Moreover, celebrity endorser increases perceived quality of the more established brands. © Medwell Journals, 2015.","Brand credibility; Celebrity endorser credibility; Consumer-based brand equity; Parent brand; Sub-brand",,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., (1991) Managing Brand Equity, p. 299. , Free Press, New York, USA; Belch, G.E., Belch, M.A., (1994) Introduction to Advertising and Promotion: An Integrated Marketing Communications Perspective, p. 784. , Irwin Professional Pub., USA; Belch, G.E., Belch, M.A., (2001) Advertising and Promotion: An integrated Marketing Communications Perspective, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Bello, D.C., Holbrook, M.B., Does an absence of brand equity generalize across product classes?

Determination of the coordinates of the center point (centroid) is generally done by generating random numbers and each instance will then be placed based on proximity to random numbers generated. Determining a good centroid will prevent the occurrence of local optima problems in K-Means. The GenClust++ algorithm is a pretty good algorithm in determining centroid. However, what needs to be considered is the influence of the selection and crossover process on the performance of clustering. This study will discuss the combination of selection and crossover processes that are good in the process of determining the centroid. Performance measurement method will be based on the measurement of Mean Square Error and distance calculation using Euclidean Distance. The results show that the Roulette Wheel Selection and Whole Arithmetic Crossover selection processes will give the best performance for the GenClust++ Algorithm. © 2019 IEEE.","centroid; crossover; GenClust++; K-means; selection","Mean square error; Random number generation; centroid; crossover; GenClust; K-means; selection; K-means clustering",,,,,"Islam, M.Z., Estivill-Castro, V., Rahman, M.A., Bossomaier, T., Combining k-means and a genetic algorithm through a novel arrangement of genetic operators for high quality clustering (2018) Expert Systems with Applications, 91, pp. 402-417; Lloyd, S., Least squares quantization in pcm (1982) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 28 (2), pp. 129-137; Wu, X., Kumar, V., Quinlan, J.R., Ghosh, J., Yang, Q., Motoda, H., McLachlan, G.J., Steinberg, D., Top 10 algorithms in data mining (2008) Knowledge and Information Systems, 14 (1), pp. 1-37; Maitra, R., Peterson, A.D., Ghosh, A.P., (2010) A Systematic Evaluation of Different Methods for Initializing the K-Means Clustering Algorithm; Maulik, U., Bandyopadhyay, S., Genetic algorithm-based clustering technique (2000) Pattern Recognition, 33 (9), pp. 1455-1465; Rahman, M.A., Islam, M.Z., Crudaw: A novel fuzzy technique for clustering records following user defined attribute weights (2012) Tenth Australasian Data Mining Conference; Zahra, S., Ghazanfar, M.A., Khalid, A., Azam, M.A., Naeem, U., Prugel-Bennett, A., Novel centroid selection approaches for kmeans-clustering based recommender systems (2015) Information Sciences, 320, pp. 156-189; Liu, Y., Wu, X., Shen, Y., Automatic clustering using genetic algorithms (2011) Applied Mathematics and Computation, 218 (4), pp. 1267-1279; Rahman, M.A., Islam, M.Z., A hybrid clustering technique combining a novel genetic algorithm with k-means (2014) Knowledge-Based Systems, 71, pp. 345-365; Beg, A.H., Islam, M.Z., Estivill-Castro, V., Genetic algorithm with healthy population and multiple streams sharing information for clustering (2016) Knowledge-Based Systems, 114, pp. 61-78; Muzid, S., Dinamisasi parameter algoritma genetika menggunakan population resizing on fitness improvement fuzzy evolutionary algorithm (profifea) (2014) Seminar Nasional Teknologi Dan Informatika; He, S., Dai, Y., Zhou, R., Zhao, S., A clustering routing protocol for energy balance of wsn based on genetic clustering algorithm (2012) IERI Procedia, 2, pp. 788-793; Cowgill, M.C., Harvey, R.J., Watson, L.T., A genetic algorithm approach to cluster analysis (1999) Computers & Mathematics with Applications, 37 (7), pp. 99-108; Meng, Y., Liang, J., Cao, F., He, Y., A new distance with derivative information for functional k-means clustering algorithm (2018) Information Sciences, 463-464, pp. 166-185; Ongko, H.E., Abdullah, D., Determining a cluster centroid of k-means clustering using genetic algorithm (2015) International Journal of Computer Science and Software Engineering, 4 (6), pp. 160-164; (2018) Machine Learning Repository, , https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php, UCI [online] Available: [Accessed 6 September",,"Supangkat S.H.Sembiring J.Arman A.A.Nugraha IGB.B.Bandung Y.",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","10th International Conference on ICT for Smart Society, ICISS 2019","19 November 2019 through 20 November 2019",,157204,,9781728148809,,,"English","Proceeding - Int.

But to improve, it is very difficult. A company often get a problem to achieve a standardization of Information Technology (IT) services. This paper aims to propose an effectiveness and efficiency design of ITSM through capability maturity model integration (CMMI) in an organization to manage IT division. ITSM is affected by the procedure, performance, and capability of IT division. They determine the success level of the Services Level Agreement (SLA) within the organization. Derived from literature studies and interviews from the organization management member and the IT user, the paper argue that the practice of information technology infrastructure library (ITIL) done by CMMI is recommended to improve the IT services to support an organization to meet SLA. © 2017 IEEE.","CMMI; IT Services; ITSM; SLA","Information management; Software engineering; Capability maturity model integration; CMMI; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Information technology infrastructure library (ITIL); Information technology services; IT services; ITSM; Services level agreements; Efficiency",,,,,"Kumbakara, N., Managed IT services: The role of IT standards (2008) Inf.

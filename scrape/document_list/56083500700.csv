It is not commonly practiced systematically, particularly in state owned companies. Hence, the purpose of this research is to develop a web-based knowledge management system design based on the path analysis results and TAM model to support state owned companies. The path analysis aims to determine the extent of the employee's intention to support knowledge management system creation. The data will be collected from 63 respondent questionnaire, interviews and observation in the construction consulting company. The research results revealed the significance between attitude toward computer and organizational culture toward the intentions of employees using knowledge management systems. Therefore, the knowledge management system design is recommended to apply in the company with the suggestive KMS features. © 2020 IEEE.","Knowledge management system; OOAD; Path analysis; State owned companies; TAM","Behavioral research; Human resource management; Knowledge based systems; Regression analysis; Surveys; Systems analysis; Consulting companies; Knowledge management system; Organizational cultures; Path analysis; Research results; State-owned companies; Support knowledge; Web based; Knowledge management",,,,,"Yusof, M.N., Bakar, A.H.A., Knowledge management and growth performance in construction companies: A framework (2012) Procedia-Soc.

In contrary, the increasing of the ICT usage is not followed by the increasing of the green ICT awareness and behavior. Our previous research on Private higher education institution practice of green information technology governance model had resulted some obstruction on the implementation. One of the most crucial aspect among others is the government policies and regulations deficiencies.

The high-level house of quality matrix was modified and used as a tool to evaluate the ongoing KMS implementation. Additionally, the Infosys KM Maturity Model was applied to determine its maturity level. Targeted result for this study is to form a recommendation for KMS implementation in the organization, especially in the private banking industry. KMS spread to various business field. It becomes an obligation for every organization to manage its knowledge flow and drive it to achieve innovation. As an industry with huge amount of knowledge come in and out daily, banking industry need to take their KMS to another level. By evaluating its KMS periodically, organization may improve the performance, quality and maturity level of its KMS. © 2019 IEEE.","HoQ; house of quality; KMS; knowledge management system; private banking industry","Houses; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Banking industry; Evaluation of knowledge; House of Quality; Indonesia; Knowledge flow; Knowledge management system; Maturity levels; Maturity model; Quality control",,,,,"Tanaji, B.S., (2012) Benefits of Knowledge Management System for Banking Sector, 3 (1), pp. 133-137; Chawla, D., Joshi, H., (2010) Knowledge Management Initiatives in Indian Public and Private Sector Organizations, 14 (6), pp. 811-827; Cham, T.H.T.H., Lim, Y.M., Cheng, B.L., Lee, Determinants of knowledge management systems success in the banking industry (2016) VINE J.

It can be classified into several types, such as unacceptable dimensions, defects on the material, and others. However, due to the various factors that may cause the defect, it is not easy to pinpoint what actually causes the defect on the products. By using a decision tree, it is easier to determine the root cause of each defect as well as providing fast-response solution for each case. In the Quality Control (QC) department of a grinding wheel manufacturing company, the QC staffs need to answer some questions about the characteristics of the products. The decision tree certainly will help to find the root cause and it also generates the action for solving the problems. At the end of the session, the staff will get the decision whether the product can be accepted or should be destroyed. © 2018 IEEE.","decision tree; defect; quality control","Decision trees; Defects; Information management; Product design; Defect classification; Design faults; Fast response; Manufacturing companies; Product defects; Root cause; Quality control",,,,,"Bak, B., Batmaz, I., Göntörkön, F.A., Köksal, I.A.I.G., Özdemirel, N.E., (2008) Defect Cause Modeling with Decision Tree and Regression Analysis, 2 (12), pp. 1334-1337; Rokach, L., Maimon, O., (2014) Data Mining with Decision Trees, 81; Tan, P.-N., Steinbach, M., Kumar, V., Classification : Basic concepts , decision trees (2006) Introd.To Data Min, 67 (17), pp. 145-205; Venkatasubramaniam, A., Wolfson, J., Mitchell, N., Barnes, T., Jaka, M., French, S., Decision trees in epidemiological research (2017) Emerg.

As a matter of fact, the use of information technology and information system for medical purpose is continuously growing. This phenomenon is widely known as telemedicine. Indonesia as the largest country in South East Asia has been facing healthcare as its key problem. The equal distribution of healthcare is difficult to achieve due to the geographical condition. Therefore, the need to implement knowledge management (KM) for telemedicine in Indonesia will help Indonesian society obtain medical knowledge simultaneously. The KM model for Telemedicine in Indonesia was derived from SECI model by Nonaka and Takeuchi. The conversion of 2(two) types of knowledge (tacit and explicit knowledge) were becoming the focus point. The research methodology used literature review and forum group discussion (FGD) with medical practitioners. Expectantly, most features created from this model, will become propose features for KM portal for telemedicine in Indonesia. © 2017 IEEE.","Knowledge Conversion; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Management Model; SECI Model; Spiral Model; Telemedicine","Health care; Information use; Knowledge management; Telemedicine; Geographical conditions; Knowledge conversion; Knowledge management model; Medical practitioner; Research methodologies; SECI model; Spiral models; Tacit and explicit knowledge; Medical information systems",,,,,"(2014) Kompas.com, , http://health.kompas.com/read/2014/03/12/0924352/Hadapi.Era.Telemedicine.Siapkah, Unoviana Kartika, Maret, [Online]; Suharto, H., (2015) Infoasia.id, , http://www.infoasia.id/berita-telemedis-diagnosa-pasien-jarakjauh.html, Desember, [Online]; Hatem, B., Nick Hajili, M., Xiaolin, L., Mauricio, F., Ivan, C., Social media for developing health services (2013) Qualitative Market Research: An International Journa, 17 (3), pp. 283-296; (2013) News.detik.com, , http://news.detik.com/berita/2360584/siasati-penanganan-cepatpasien-haji-bphi-makkah-ujicoba-telemedicine/2, DetikNews, September, [Online]; (2015) Newsroom.gehealthcare.com, , http://newsroom.gehealthcare.com/getting-puskesmas-online-the-next-frontier-forindonesian-healthcare/, Newsroom.gehealthcare.com, Agustus, [Online]; Elfita, R., (2016), http://lifestyle.bisnis.com/, Oktober, HYPERLINK http://lifestyle.bisnis.com/read/20160628/106/562026/telemedicinesolusi-untuk-peningkatan-pelayanan-kesehatan-di-daerah-terpencil"" http://lifestyle.bisnis.com/read/20160628/106/562026/telemedicinesolusi-untuk-peningkatan-pelayanan-kesehatan-di-daerah-terpencil; Laudon, K.C., Laudon, J.P., (2016) Management Information Systems: Managing the Digital Firm, , Pearson; Wickramasinghe, N., Healthcare knowledge management: Incorporating the tools, technologies, strategies, and process of knowledge management to effect superior healthcare delivery (2007) Healthcare Knowledge Management: Issues, Advances, Sucesses, pp. 21-38. , Springer; Alsanad, A., Zemirli, N., A guideline for using knowledge management in telemedicine systems dedicated for diabetes patients in Saudi Arabia (2015) New Contributions in Information Systems and Technologies: Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 1, pp. 193-201. , Springer; DelliFraine, J.L., Dansky, K.H., Rumberger, J., The use of knowledge management in telemedicine (2009) International Journal of Healthcare Management and Technology, 10 (3), pp. 209-222; Lamont, J., (2014) KMworld.com, , http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/Editorial/Features/Healthcareanatomy-of-telemedicine-systems-101144.aspx, Desember, [Online], HYPERLINK http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/Editorial/Features/Healthcare-anatomy-of-telemedicine-systems-101144.aspx; Fong, B., Fong, A.C.M., Li, C.K., (2011) Telemedicine Technologies: Information Technologies in Medicine and Telehealth, , John Wiley & Sons; Jawad, M., Abass, J., Hariri, A., Akl, E.A., Social media use for public health campaigning in a low resource setting: The case of waterpipe tobacco smoking (2015) BioMed Research International; Aitken, M., Engaging patients through social media: Is healthcare ready for empowered and digitally demanding patients?

As the market becomes increasingly unpredictable, people are forced to develop their individual potentials for the sake of survival. Besides personal development, interaction among people through sharing of knowledge is equally critical. This paper discusses the impact of downsizing on knowledge sharing environment in an airline company. The findings reveal that employees had different views on the impact of downsizing on knowledge sharing. Their views were influenced by self-enthusiasm towards knowledge sharing. The availability of media for sharing also had an influence on knowledge sharing.","Airline industry; Downsizing; Knowledge management; Knowledge sharing",,,,,,"Amabile, T.M., Conti, R., Changes in the work environment for creativity during downsizing (1999) Academy of Management Journal, 42 (6), pp. 630-640; Appelbaum, S.H., Patton, E., Shapiro, B., The early retirement incentive program: A downsizing strategy (2003) Journal of European Industrial Training, 27 (1), pp. 22-35; Armstrong-Stassen, M., Cameron, S.J., Thornburgh, M.E., Downsizing initiated job transfer of hospital nurses: How do the job transfers fare?

The negative impact that is caused from the waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), has forced many institutions to take some serious action. In the other hand the dependencies toward electronic devices are getting higher, especially in the education area. This paper discusses the E-Waste handling in the area of private higher education institution. Private higher education institution gives significantly contribution to the increasing of the electronic waste. The use of technology has grown rapidly caused by the growth of the student’s intake as well as the need to provide them with the latest technology. However, E-Waste model has been developed and still under reviewed continuously. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT & LLS.

Meanwhile, DKI Jakarta as the capital city of Indonesia has a total of 325 private higher education institutions. Green IT term is quiet well known in these areas, although its implementation is still sporadic. However, information technology (IT) gives fully support toward the learning process at the campus area. As its project scope, this research was focused in DKI Jakarta, but it is applicable for others. Many research on green IT or green computing have been conducted, however none of them focusing on Private Higher Education Institutions in Indonesia. Based on the previous research done by various Private Higher Education Institutions,IBM and Green Computing Methodology by GTYS, the Green IT Governance Model for Private Higher Education Institutions in DKI Jakarta area was developed. However, further researches are expected in order to develop the best practice. Furthermore, energy saving, waste management systems and information technology will be controlled accordingly and the threat of toxins that can harm our health can be avoided. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

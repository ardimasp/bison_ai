However, the research on the phenomenon of applying social media marketing to museums has been investigated by international researchers, but has never been done by researchers in Indonesia. This study has a focus on testing whether the Museum Facebook Fan Page User Experience is a mediator or moderator variable between user motivations and user expectations of intention to use Facebook Museum Fan page and whether the online community involvement moderates the relation between the Facebook Fan Page usage intention to the visit museum intention. The research design is the quantitative approach. Data was collected using a questionnaire distributed to followers of the museum Facebook Fan Page in Indonesia. The researchers was randomly select the museum Facebook Fan Page and online cultural community Facebook groups in Indonesia. The sample size was 270 respondents. The data analysis is the Structural Equation Modeling analysis method using AMOS Ver. 22. In this study, eight hypotheses are accepted and one hypothesis is rejected. The r2 of the Facebook Fan Page usage intention is 0.446, it means that the variable can be explained by user expectations, user motivations, and Facebook Fan Page User Experience. The r2 of the visit museum intention is 0.350, it means that the variable can be explained by the Facebook Fan Page User Experience and online community involvement. The contribution of this research is to contribute the Facebook Adoption model that accommodates the Facebook Fan Page usage experience and the online community involvement for marketing and cultural education in the Museum industry in Indonesia. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Facebook Fan Page User Experience; Online Community Involvement; The Facebook Fan Page Usage Intention; The Visit Museum Intention; User Expectations; User Motivations",,,,,,"(2016) Slideshare: Global Digital Statistics for 2016, , http://www.digitalbuzzblog.com/slideshareglobal-digital-statistics-report-for-2016, [Accessed: 07-Jun-2016]; Utama, I.G.B.R., Mengelola Warisan Budaya Sebagai Produk Pariwisata (2015) Researchgate, , http://www.yayasankertagama.org/article/article3.pdf, [Accessed: 13-Mar-2017]; UNESCO, (2008) Towards Sustainable Strategies for Creative Tourism; (2017) Tentang Pemajuan Kebudayaan. 2017; Wulandari, A.A.A., Fajarwati, A.A.S., Latif, F., The Relationship of Exhibition Space Design and the Success of Delivering Messages to Museum Visitors in Jakarta (2017) Humaniora, 8 (3), p. 219. , Oct; Sulistiyana, R.T., Hamid, D., Azizah, D.F., Pengaruh Fasilitas Wisata dan Harga Terhadap Kepuasan Konsumen (Studi pada Museum Satwa) (2015) J.

Therefore, improvement of business processes, technological reliability (technology), and readiness of human resources (people) is very important to be done continuously in order to provide a perfect educational service for all stakeholders concerned. Because of its online environment, every academic operational activities should be run smoothly so the institution could deliver a high-quality services to every stakeholders related. Some of the activity that needed to be improved in academic operational is the exam preparation and planning process. Since it's still manual, the process of it is still reluctant of human-error and very time-consuming. This study aims to implement business process management (BPM) in the exam preparation process in Operational Section of BINUS Online Learning, BPM framework will be conducted and some of tools are used in the research, such as business process model and notation, process selection matrix, and activity-based costing. Based on findings, online exam application came out as a proposed solution. Cost and time saving estimation by 85.85% and 36.04% are the result if the proposed solution will be developed and implemented. © 2018 IEEE.","activity-based-costing; business process; business process management; business process management framework; online learning business process","Administrative data processing; Computer aided instruction; Cost accounting; Costs; Enterprise resource management; Information management; Activity based costing; Business Process; Business process management; Business process model; Educational services; High quality service; Online learning environment; Operational activity; E-learning",,,,,"Drǎgan, M., Ivana, D., Arba, R., Business process modeling in higher education institutions developing a framework for Total Quality Management at Institutional Level (2014) Procedia Econ.

We found that local online startup SME professionals were aware of risks that might happened from IT services failure to their business, however, effort to manage the IT services were still minimum. It was due to the company size, as deploying a proper IT service and risk management are not cheap, hence there is no economic value to deploy an end to end IT service and risk management solution. In the other hand, they have never experienced a prolonged IT outage with severe damages. The research also showed that IRP (incident Resolution and Prevention) method to manage IT services availability is more suitable to be deployed by SME online business instead of Full ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) method. © 2017 IEEE.","IRP; IT service and risk management; IT service failure; ITIL; Online startup SME","Information management; Company size; Economic values; In-progress research; It infrastructure libraries; IT services; ITIL; Online business; Online startup SME; Risk management",,,,,"https://www.statista.com/statistics/254456/number-of-internet-users-Inindonesia/; Umesh, U.N., Jessup, L., Huynh, M., Current issues faced by technology entrepreneurs (2007) Communications of the ACM, 50 (10), pp. 60-66. , (October); What is Descriptive Research ?, , https://www.aect.org/edtech/ed1/41/41-01.html; What is ITIL ?, , https://www.axelos.com/best-practice-solutions/itil/whatis-itil; ITIL V2 Vs ITIL V3: What's the Difference?, , http://www.bmc.com/blogs/itil-v2-vs-itil-v3-whats-difference/; Cronholm, S., Hallqvist, C., (2016) Assesment of IT Services : The Need of A Service Perspective; University of Boras; Du-Moulin, T., Turbitt, K., ITIL best practices in SAP environment (2007) Pink Element 2007; Olaitan, O., Flowerday, S., Successful IT governance in SMEs: An application of the technology-organisation-environment theory (2015) South African Journal of Information Management, 18 (1). , a696",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2nd International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2017","15 November 2017 through 17 November 2017",,134470,,9781538629307,,,"English","Proc.

At first, local startup online companies learned that free stuffs will attract traffics and once you get the traffic, revenue will follow. However, it doesn't come easily. PT IP, as a local online escrow service provider for C to C, transaction traffics were dropped to more than 80% after they start to charge the transactions with a very low administration fee. While PT PS, which offers part time jobs to freelancers, had a different strategy, they charged their services from the day one. This in-progress research found that creating traffics by giving free services to generate future revenue may not be suitable for SME (small to medium enterprise) due to capital limitation and lack of economic of scale, therefore start managing your online business revenue from the day one, stop giving free stuffs and start making money by managing valuable traffics. © 2016 IEEE.","Free Offers; Internet; Online Business; Revenue; SME; Startup; valuable traffics","Earnings; Information management; Internet; Reactor startup; Escrow services; Free Offers; In-progress research; Online business; Part time jobs; SME (small to medium enterprise); Study case; valuable traffics; Internet protocols",,,,,"Chuttur, M.Y., Overview of the technology acceptance model: Origins, developments and future directions (2009) Indiana University.

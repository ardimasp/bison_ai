This study was conducted in PT XYZ, a small company which had problems in selecting and evaluating the candidate employees for some higher positions in an attempt of improving the effectiveness of their employees’ performance. The respondents were nine employees with different positions. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) system, Expert Choice software, interview, and questionnaire were used to solve the problem. The results show: first, shift 3 supervisor is eligible to get promoted to line A supervisor. Second, shift 1 supervisor is eligible to be promoted to line B supervisor; and third, line B supervisor is more qualified to be promoted to a production manager than supervisor A. They are eligible to be promoted because they have met the criteria according to standard of the performance appraisal using AHP. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","AHP; Performance appraisal; Promotion selection",,,,,,"Al-Salamin, H., Al-Baqshi, J., Micro-factors influencing site selection for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Saudi Arabia: Alhassa area using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) analysis (2015) European Scientific Journal, ESJ, 11 (28); Alberto, P., The logistics of industrial location decisions:An application of the analytic hierarchy process methodology (2000) International JournalofLogistics:ResearchandApplications, 3 (3), pp. 273-289; Aro-Gordon, S., An IT-based appraisal model for effective performance management system in Nigeria (2015) 4 th International Conference on Managing Human Resources at the Workplace, , December 4-5; Bhattacharya, S., Subramanian, J., Bhopte, B., Implementation of analytical hierarchical process to support decisions in employee performance appraisal (2012) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology and Security, 2 (2); Bitici, U.S., Suwignjo, P., Carrie, A.S., Strategy management through quantitative modelling of performance measurement system (2001) International Journal of Production Economics, 69 (1), pp. 15-22; Büyüközkan, G., Feyzioğlu, O., Nebol, E., Selection of the strategic alliance partner in logistics value chain (2008) International Journal of Production Economics, 113 (1); Caesar, L.A.Y., Performance excellence by transformational leadership in developing collectivistic culture for Indonesian companies (2016) Pertanika Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities, 24 (S), pp. 19-32; Cebi, F., Zeren, Z., A decision support model for location selection: Bank branch case (2008) Portland International Conference in Management of Engineering and Technology, 2008.

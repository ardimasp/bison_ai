Numerous kinds of inventories are stored in a warehouse where locating goods can be troublesome for the employees. Specifically, in corrugated box company, inventories of paper rolls are placed in a huge warehouse where there are hundreds of paper rolls stock ranging from different weights and sizes. Finished goods are also stored in a warehouse awaiting delivery, placed in between hundreds of other customers' orders where delivery schedule varies from one another. Thus, the positioning of the goods is not permanent and is changing along with the incoming orders. The research aims to explore BLE beacons for the most effective solution in handling inventory placement problems. Common tracking technologies for inventories include barcodes, QR codes, and RFID. The fourth industrial revolution drives the application of IoT, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons are one of the examples in the area. It is the successor of the previous Bluetooth technology, which is more eminent in energy saving. In warehouses, BLE beacons are positioned to determine zone mapping in organizing the floor plan, assists in indoor navigation for guiding employees, and support asset tracking with beacon tags for identification and goods tracing. © 2020 IEEE.","Asset tracking; Bluetooth beacon; Bluetooth low energy; Bluetooth low energy beacon; Indoor navigation; Inventory mapping","Bluetooth; Energy conservation; Information management; Inventory control; Mapping; Personnel; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Supply chains; Bluetooth low energies (BLE); Bluetooth low energies (BTLE); Bluetooth technology; Delivery schedules; In-door navigations; Industrial revolutions; Inventory management; Tracking technology; Warehouses",,,,,"Singh, D., Verma, A., Inventory management in supply chain (2018) 7th International Conference of Materials Processing and Characterization, pp. 3867-3872; Priniotakis, G., Argyropoulos, P., Inventory management concepts and techniques (2018) IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 459, pp. 1-8; Trab, S., Bajic, E., Zouinkhi, A., Abdelkrim, M., Chekir, H., RFID iot-enabled warehouse for safety management (2018) Int.

The current fraud detection system applied in financial institutions relies heavily on manual intervention, consuming a lot of time and prone to errors. Hence, a fraud detection decision support system will be created to aid financial institutions to detect suspicious activities quickly and requires minimum manual intervention. Classification rule will be set up depending on fraud scenario based on real-life use cases. Common scenarios will be adopted into learning models for the dataset to be processed. Transactional dataset will be prepared according to the predefined template and scenario. The result of the processing will be categorized based on the Risk Level which was derived from the Confidence Level that were obtained. Testing were conducted using 3 different datasets using a set of parameters.

PCB boards goes through lots of production process from panel cutting to laminating and one single defect in a board will make the entire board become obsolete. With the rise of electronic appliances demand every day, the demand for higher quality components is rising. With the high price tag of commercial AOI, lots of manufacturers are not able to do an automated inspection. This is where Computer Vision can provide an alternative for commercial AOI to assist small scale manufacturers to do an automated inspection. Image Subtraction and Blob detection enable users to easily find numerous visual defects in PCBs especially with a complex method. By dissecting pictures and pointing out the differences on the output image, PCBs can be inspected quickly to find out the defective parts. And thus, this thesis will focus on the basis that a basic image subtraction will be enough to assist Manufacturers in Quality Inspections. © 2017 IEEE.","AOI; Computer Vision; Image Subtraction; OpenCV; PCB","Computer vision; Defects; Information management; Inspection; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Printed circuit manufacture; Automated inspection; Electronic appliances; Image subtraction; OpenCV; Pcb manufacturing; Production process; Quality components; Quality inspection; Printed circuit boards",,,,,"Chauhan, A.P.S., Bhardwaj, S.C., Detection of bare PCB defects by image subtraction method using machine vision (2011) Proceedings of the World Congress on Engineering 201, 2. , July; McIntyre, S., 7 simple & technology driven PCB quality control methods (2017) Syscom Tech USA, , http://www.syscomtechusa.com/simple-technology-driven-pcb-qualitycontrol-methods/, 2 February, [Online]; Anjoran, R., What Is A Quality Inspection?, , https://qualityinspection.org/qc-inspection-china/, [Online]; Moganti, M., Ercal, F., Dagli, C.H., Tsunekawa, S., Automatic PCB inspection algorithms (1996) Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 63 (2), pp. 287-313; Shapiro, L.G., Stockman, G.C., (2001) Computer Vision, , Pearson; Bradski, G., Kaehler, A., (2008) Learning OpenCV, , O'Reilly; Nixon, M., (2008) Feature Extraction & Image Processing, , Academic Press; Russell, S.J., Norvig, P., (2009) Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, , New Jersey: Prentice-Hall; Fisher, R., Perkins, S., Walker, A., Wolfart, E., (2000) Image Arithmetic-Pixel Subtraction, , https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/pixsub.htm, [Online], [Accessed 1 July 2017]",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2nd International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2017","15 November 2017 through 17 November 2017",,134470,,9781538629307,,,"English","Proc.

It because the only product produced by Research Institute is knowledge. P2LD LIPI (Deep Sea Research Center - Indonesian Institute of Sciences) has faced problems; one of them is limited human resources, noticed from the number of available researchers who are mostly in their retirement period. It requires right solution to solve it, which is right KM implementation to give positive impact for organization advancement. That problem is noticed before the existence of knowledge sharing culture and lack of KM understanding, so knowledge is only owned by an individual. The current KM implementation do not give the expected result yet and need to be evaluated the reason and how to solve. Instrument that is used in research has been tested both validity and reliability. This study used OCAI as instrument that researched the effect of organization culture to KM process and questionnaires as instrument that researched the effect of organization structure to KM process in P2LD LIPI. Using simple regression analysis tests KM process and organization structure. From analysis, P2LD organization culture is expected to have clan and hierarchy cultures with requirements clan dominates and from organization structure and KM process are resulted an analysis that there is an influence between those 2 variables. From this research, it can be concluded that organization culture at P2LD is expected to be clan and hierarchy that are flexible, caring each other, stable and controllable. Besides that, there will be top-down information flow and working in team. © 2017 IEEE.","KM Process; Knowledge Management; OCAI; Organization Culture; Organization Structure","Regression analysis; Surveys; Deep sea research; Evaluation of knowledge; Knowledge sharing cultures; OCAI; Organization culture; Organization structures; Research institutes; Simple regression analysis; Knowledge management",,,,,"Alavi, M., Leidner, D.R., Review : Knowledge management and knowledge management systems : Conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Quarterly, pp. 107-136; Ambon, P.L., (2016) LKJ P2LD 2015.

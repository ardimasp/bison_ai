The result by using 7 tools of quality method finds that there are 6 types of production defects in the company in which 3 of them have high frequency of defect. These defects are caused by several major factors which are machines, men, measurement and environment. In addition, the results also show that the company's production processes are outside the control limits. Therefore, the company is advised to take immediate quality control steps by monitoring the productivity of two main factors that cause defect which are machines and men.

It is an important research since the rise of smart phones these days students have been more attached to their phones instead of focusing on the lessons. The urgency of this research is that students might get more and more distracted everyday with their smart phones instead of focusing on the lessons in the class. The data were collected by distributing questionnaire to 100 students. The result shows even though the students are aware that the using of smart phone might disturb their learning process, they cannot leave it. Thus, incorporating the smart phone in learning activities could be the best option. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

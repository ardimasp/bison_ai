Indonesia Transportation State-Owned Enterprise PT Angkasa Pura II Indonesia has the leeway and autonomy to do ERP investments in supporting the achievement of its vision and mission. The World Economic Forum, put Indonesia on a ranking of 82 among the countries in the world in ICT utilization. This research was conducted to evaluate the performance of ERP implementation project. ERP implementation success rates seen from aspect of project management, determination of critical elements of urgency and contextual factors. The result that all independent variables influence significantly to the success of the implementation of ERP of SOE's manufactures. The greatest contribution to the success of such in sequence are an element of urgency determination of critical factors, a contextual factor, and management of the project. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Economics; Investments; Project management; Contextual factors; Critical elements; Enterprise resource planning (ERP); ERP implementation; Erp implementation projects; Independent variables; State owned enterprise; Transportation sector; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,,"Cline, M.K., Guynes, C.S., A study of the impact of information technology investment on firm performance (2001) The Journal of Computer Information Systems, 3, p. 41; The Ministry of Finance.

ABC is one of the well-known resin manufacturing companies that produces resin in large quantity. However, there is still residual production due to excess raw materials. The objective of this research is to find out appropriate combination of resin to be used in paint production, so that PT. ABC would achieve an optimal profit. The research method used to solve the problem is Forecasting Method and De Novo Programming. Besides, this research uses QM for Windows 2 software to support data analysis process. The results show that the demand forecast in December 2015 for each type of resin is: 240,146 kg (long type), 311,858 kg (medium type), 340,783 kg (short type), and 376.660 (other types).

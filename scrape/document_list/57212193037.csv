Discussion forums, also referred to as a means to discuss all learning materials and conference systems, are also a means to discuss the material as a substitute for face-to-face meetings between students and lecturers. This phenomenon is also found in online learning. Unfortunately, online learning is not supported by 24-hour real-time lecturer responses. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify, analyze needs, and design Chatbots that can be used as role models to develop LMS as an intelligent academic information system, especially to support 24 hours of interactive learning processes in all subjects. This study uses the Natural Language Processing approach to generate responses such as daily conversations. The analysis is done and used to design chatbots that can maximize LMS work that is smart and can help student learning activities, especially around the most frequently asked questions. After being tested on several subjects in the Information System Engineering group, it is known that Chatbot can interact with students like having daily conversations. In the future, the results of this study are used as supporting systems for recommendations on smart LMS. © 2019 IEEE.","Chatbot; Massive Online Open Courses; Natural Language Processing; Smart LMS","E-learning; Information systems; Information use; Natural language processing systems; Students; Chatbot; Face-to-face meetings; Frequently asked questions; Interactive learning; Massive Online Open Courses; NAtural language processing; Smart LMS; Supporting systems; Learning systems",,,,,"Serban, I.V., Sankar, C., Germain, M., Zhang, S., Lin, Z., Subramanian, S., Rajeshwar, S., (2017) A Deep Reinforcement Learning Chatbot, , arXiv preprint arXiv, 1709.02349; Hone, K.S., El Said, G.R., Exploring the factors affecting MOOC retention: A survey study (2016) Computers & Education, 98, pp. 157-168; Lalwani, T., Bhalotia, S., Pal, A., Bisen, S., Rathod, V., (2018) Implementation of a Chat Bot System Using AI and NLP; Weizenbaum, J., ELIZA-a computer program for the study of natural language communication between man and machine (1966) Communications of the ACM, 9 (1), pp. 36-45; Radziwill, N.M., Benton, M.C., (2017) Evaluating Quality of Chatbots and Intelligent Conversational Agents, , arXiv preprint arXiv, 1704.04579; Shawar, B.A., Atwell, E., Chatbots: Are they really useful?

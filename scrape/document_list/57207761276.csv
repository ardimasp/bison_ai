The desire to grow crops in the housing unit is increasingly gone. But now, all can be made using hydroponic techniques. Hydroponic technique is six cultivation by utilizing water without using soil by emphasizing the fullness of nutritional needs for plants. This farming technique is now being tucked away as an effort to present green land in a settlement with small and dense land. Therefore, a lay out design solution that accommodates residents in the housing area can be planted with hydroponics. Hydroponics is a business for urban farming. The research method used is an experiment with qualitative research. The plan for conducting the research activities will be a survey and field data collection, then continued with drawing work and designing layout. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Housing; Hydroponics; Lay out","Housing; Design solutions; Designing layout; Field data collection; Hydroponics; Lay-out; Qualitative research; Research activities; research methods; Engineering research",,,,,"Donald, W., (2003) Time Saver Standards for Urban Desain.; Philippe, P., (2004) Urban Form, p. 103; Terry, W., Anthony, R., Helen, B., (2003) Understanding Sustainable Architecture; Sue, R., Manuel, F., Stephanie, T., (2001) Ecohouse (A Design Guide); Gernot, M., (2006) Building with Earth (Cultural Issues in Vernakular Architecture)","Ardiani, Y.M.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: millaardiani@binus.ac.id",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Government has realized the need of infrastructure development for the settlement in small islands through the Presidential Decree. However, the development of infrastructure must follow the characteristics of its potential and constraints as an island. Bawean Island is a small island with an area approximately 190 km2 that is located in the Java Sea and in the north of Surabaya, which the capital of East Java, Indonesia. The soil morphology of Bawean is mountainous, and high and low hilly. So, it is necessary to identify the infrastructure in Bawean Island to facilitate the design of island according to its soil morphology. This research used qualitative method that is a direct survey by staying in Bawean Island. The data collection is by interviewing local people and supplemented with theories of islands. It is expected that the complete data about Bawean Island's infrastructure can create spatial design of Bawean Island. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Information systems have a role to help manage business processes effectively and efficiently. Case studies on PT XYZ companies show that the use of IS / IT has not been optimal in supporting the sustainability of its business processes. This is due to the absence of information technology architecture planning that is aligned with the company's business strategy, especially related to the Enterprise Architecture (EA) which consists of Business Architecture, Data Architecture, Application Architecture and Technology Architecture. Business processes and organizational activities. This study aims to design cloud computing-based Enterprise Architecture (EA) for PT. TELIN using the TOGAF ADM method as a framework. The integration between Enterprise Architecture (EA) and cloud computing brings great benefits to the company. Cloud Computing provides elasticity in software and hard solutions in organizations, while Enterprise Architecture (EA) guarantees compatibility between business strategies and IT strategies. This study produced the architectural design of the company PT. TELIN is done by looking at business strategies in the process of production and product distribution with the aim of supporting the implementation of the company's information system as a whole, resolving the problem of information system integration, and increasing effectiveness and efficiency in the implementation of information technology infrastructure. © 2019 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; Enterprise Architecture; TOGAF","Architectural design; Cloud computing; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Application architecture; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Enterprise Architecture; Information system integration; Information technology architectures; Information technology infrastructure; Organizational activities; TOGAF; Computer architecture",,,,,"Hackney, R., Tassabehji, R., Hey you?

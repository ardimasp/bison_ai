There are many techniques in data mining that is frequently used by developer for business, healthcare, technology, and also government. However, the existing research has shown that selecting suitable data mining techniques for complaint service can provide useful information to government. This literature review aims to investigate data mining technique that suitable to e-government complaint service according to desired outcome and characteristic of data obtained. There are 5 determination factor in this study to determine the suitable data mining techniques such as the desired outcome, characteristic of the data, and etc. The techniques itself have been found 6 such as classification, regression, clustering, summarization, change and deviation detection, and dependency modelling. The result will benefits to government in selecting data mining techniques for complaint service to analyse a large sum of complaint service data. © 2020 IEEE.","Complaint service; Data mining; E-government","e-government; Information management; Dependency modelling; Deviation detection; Literature reviews; Service data; Systematic literature review; Data mining",,,,,"Rosana, A.S., (2010) Kemajuan Teknologi Informasi Dan Komunikasi Dalam Industri Media di Indonesia., pp. 144-156; Saputra, N., Teguh Bahrata, Aji., Erna Permanasari, A., (2016) Analisis Sentimen Data Presiden Jokowi Dengan PreProcessing Normalisasi & Stemming Menggunakan Metode Naïve Bayes Dan SVM, 5 (1); Wyld, D.C., (2004) The Essential Elements of A Definition of EGovernment, 1 (1); Fayyad, U., Gregory piatetsky shapiro dan padhraic smyth (1996) Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining: Toward A Unifying Framework; Neelamegam, S., Ramaraj, E., (2013) Classification Algorithm in Data Mining: An Overview, 3; Koh, H.C., Tan, G., Data mining applications in healthcare (2011) Journal of Healthcare Information Management, 19 (2), p. 65; Larose, D.T., (2005) Discovering Knowledge in Data: An Introduction to Data Mining.

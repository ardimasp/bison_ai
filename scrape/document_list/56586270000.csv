This paper has objectives to provide analysis in both theoretical aspects and its empirical aspects of PT. Kakada Pratama, within Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework, not to mention the aspects of Supply Chain Risk Management. Precisely, it covers the process of analyzing risk relationship; identifying risk and its impact level toward supply chain activity level; and eventually deciding on the risk priority and select action within supply chain risk management strategy. PT. Kakada Pratama (PT. KP), is one of enterprises that plays role as component supplier of bridge construction projects. As Research Methodology, this paper refers to the Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) Framework, as developed by Hallikas (2002) (PT. KP). As the result of this paper, the Risk Map is compiled, and considered as the reference for the ERM and the SCRM Framework; eventually provide the table of Supply Risk Category of PT. KP. The mentioned analysis is supported by the SuperDecision Software, through Analytic Network Process (ANP) that is used in this paper. Posterior to that analysis, there are 28 risks resulted from brainstorming results and interviews with PT. KP, and at the risk of supply chain level PT. KP has a total of 14 low-risk categories, 15 moderate-risk categories, and zero high-risk categories. The mentioned results constitute the ground for further improvement for both theoretical and empirical aspects for future research. © Research India Publications.","Analytic network process; Enterprise risk management; PT.

XYZ in its development requires speed and security because security is one of the key points in product development. As we know, without a safety software system product, customers will never feel confident using the software system product. In software system development, security always faces difficulties, because testing is still done manually so that the testing process also cannot be accelerated. This study discusses how SOA can help this problem and uses one of the appropriate methodologies to support orchestration development. This research will follow the two steps of Service Oriented Architecture Delivery Lifecycle (SOADL) which includes Service Orientation Analysis and Services Orientation Design. As a result, the development of orchestration itself will become a set of service processes (Controllers) which summarize the application service layer in accordance with business rules and business logic. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

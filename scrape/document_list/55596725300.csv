With the potential of cultural diversity in Java, creative economic activities on this island need the development. The local wisdom and cultural events are reflecting the creativity of the community and can provide economic value to the community. The physical quality of creative economic spaces that can become generators in some cultural tourism areas does not have functional quality space. To support the preservation of cultural heritage and the development of superior cultural tourism areas, the quality of an excellent creative economic space is necessary. The aim of this study is to identify physical quality of space for creative economic activities or events. The method of this study used a qualitative descriptive method. Results of this study provide an overview that cultural village in Semarang and Banyuwangi have five potential creative economic activities: traditional architecture, culinary, crafts, music, and performing arts. The physical quality of these two creative economic spaces is still limited because of the limited economic capacity of the community in providing the spaces. They are shaping and realizing space with utilizes natural conditions (green open spaces or spaces among tall trees) and local material (bamboo). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Historic preservation; Tourism; Cultural diversity; Cultural events; Cultural heritages; Economic activities; Economic capacity; Natural conditions; Physical quality; Traditional architecture; Economic analysis",,,,"Kementerian Riset Teknologi Dan Pendidikan Tinggi Republik Indonesia

In general, the cooling loads are from internal and external heat. The external heat plays significantly in determining the cooling load; therefore, it is necessary to reduce the amount of solar radiation received by the external surface of the building. The objective of the paper is to investigate the reduction of solar radiation received by the surface of the multi-storey office building by applying parametric design study and to add a building envelope as the secondary skin as well as the architectural element. There are two steps of analysis in the methodology, (1) to conduct solar radiation analysis, and (2) to conduct building facade analysis. In the process, four alternatives form were simulated to obtain the most optimum shape in relation to the incident solar radiation reduction. The final parametric study results of the solar radiation and building facade analysis showed that the reduction of the irradiance is around 25% with the additional facades. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","irradiance reduction; office building; parametric facade","Air conditioning; Cooling; Facades; Office buildings; Architectural element; Building envelopes; Building facades; External surfaces; Irradiance level; Parametric design; Parametric study; Radiation analysis; Incident solar radiation",,,,,,"(2018) Handbook of Energy and Economic, , https://www.esdm.go.id/en/publication/handbook-of-energy-and-economic, Kementrian ESDM (Oktober 2) Retrieved from Kementrian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral Republik Indonesia; (2016) Panduan Penerapan Bangunan Gedung Hijau, , https://greenbuilding.jakarta.go.id, Green Building Jakarta (September 23) Retrieved from Jakarta Green Building; Woodbury, R., (2010) Elements of Parametric Design; Anton, I., Tanase, D., Informed Geometries.

Whereas, the local electricity or the grid is the main energy source for the lighting and water pump machine, therefore the energy source becomes a significant issue during this period. Currently, the local government has already provided diesel generators to substitute the local grid when it is off, however, the amount of the generators is still limited. This study, therefore, investigated an alternative energy for the electricity, particularly solar energy and this paper presents an analysis of the Jakarta duration of sunshine during rainy seasons in order to investigate which Crystalline Silicone solar cell type that can be implemented optimally for energy supply in the period of flood evacuation as well as for the shelter. A deep analysis on literature review was conducted on the three types of Crystalline Silicone solar cell, Jakarta local weather. Furthermore, the standard of International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) was also studied for the shelter design.

PV cell can converts solar radiation into electricity and as the consequence the remaining heat is lesser than that of the concrete roof. Based on this principal theory, this study focused on investigating the level of irradiance of a roof top made of PV modules. The construction process of the PV modules was conducted through simulation and parametric study in order to obtain not only an optimum irradiance level, but also to create an aesthetic form. In order to facilitate that objective, this study consists of 3 steps: (1) to determine the required parameter, (2) to construct all the required parameter into an algorithm and (3) to execute the constructed algorithm. The initial flat roof form was used as the basic form. The results show that the average shaded area of the final form is only 3%. © 2016 The Authors.

A school complex was selected to simulate the implication of this integration on an architectural design. The concept itself is based on the principle of ICT, smart city and renewable energy and is constructed through literature review. The main deliverables of the analysis are the concept of the building form and the impact of the ICET integration system on the room organization of the school building design. The outcome of this study could be used as a basic consideration for architect in regards to the application of ICET system on architectural planning and design. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","Architecture; Design; Integrated ICET system; Planning","Architecture; Building materials; Design; Information management; Planning; Building complexes; Energy technologies; Integrated ICET system; Integrated informations; Integration systems; Literature reviews; Planning and design; Renewable energies; Architectural design",,,,,,"(2008, October 24), ICT for Energy Efficiency, DG-Information Society and Media, Brussels; Kramers, A., Smart sustainable cities – Exploring ICT solutions for reduced energy use in cities (2014) Environmental Modelling and Software, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2013.12.019; Lee, J.H., (2013) Towards an Effective Framework for Building Smart Cities: Lessons from Seoul and San Fransisco, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfor.2013.08.033, Technol.

In addition, if the growth are not accompany with the advantages of the technology, it would be such a time and work stress. In this work will focus on the integration citizen's suggestion system. In addition to the suggestion system, citizen will be able to suggest an improvement through android application independently, various categories provided in the system. By implementing such system, the government will collect the data efficiently and will execute the proposal effectively without gap of time due to the traditional approach. © 2018 The Authors.

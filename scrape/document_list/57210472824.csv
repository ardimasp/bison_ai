This study aims to propose an adaptive e-learning model that is able to determine the MBTI learning styles of students. It can be used by the system as to provide learning materials or e-learning activities in each phase of learning. In this study, adaptive e-learning model there are learning sessions namely: Introduction, Content, Assignment, and Exercise. Each learning session is based on MBTI learning style. © 2018 IEEE.","Adaptive; E-learning; Learning aterial; Learning style; MBTI","E-learning; Adaptive; Adaptive e-learning; Adaptive e-learning systems; Learning aterial; Learning materials; Learning Style; MBTI; Myers-Briggs Type Indicators; Learning systems",,,,,"Hauger, D., Köck, M., State of the art of adaptivity in elearning platforms (2007) LWA, pp. 355-360; Stoyanov, S., Kirchner, P., Expert concept mapping method for defining the characteristics of adaptive e-learning: ALFANET project case (2004) Educational Technology Research and Development, 52 (2), pp. 41-54; Graf, S., Kinshuk, K., Providing adaptive courses in learning management systems with respect to learning styles (2007) E-Learn: World Conference on E-Learning in Corporate, Government, Healthcare, and Higher Education.

To increase stability and handling, four-wheel steering and active suspension were being studied. In this field of study, there is one possibility to affect vehicle stability and tires, which will be focused on to develop is Camber. Each type of Camber has advantages and disadvantages. Negative camber has the advantage of preventing tilt on the vehicle when turning, positive camber will reduce steering load when turning at low speed, and camber 0 will maximize grip when the vehicle is moving straight. Therefore, it is possible to adapt it to their needs. In this research, maximizing the camber duty of vehicles using MacPherson strut suspensions, that widely used in vehicles today, to increase vehicle stability while turning or running straight; and to help stop tire wear in its track. To maximizing the duty, automatic adjustment, namely controlling and camber modification mechanism was done in this research. The result is the simulation of camber movements controlled using Arduino, which the movement can be adjusted to the road conditions at an angle of 0 to -4 degree; in the future, the simulation of vehicle movement and yaw rates will be implemented using a DC motor to move the camber; and stress analysis will be able to withstand the weight of the car when the camber changes. This research is expected to help the development of the automotive industry to make vehicles better in the future. © 2020 IEEE.","Arduino; camber; MacPherson strut; vehicle stability","Automobile suspensions; Cambers; DC motors; Four wheel steering; Stress analysis; Struts; Suspensions (components); Active suspension; Automatic adjustment; Camber angle; Macpherson strut suspensions; Modification mechanism; Road condition; Vehicle movements; Vehicle stability; Automobile steering equipment",,,,,"Shinde, S., Maheshwari, S., Kumar, S., Literature review on analysis of various components of mcpherson suspension (2018) Materials Today: Proceedings, 5 (9), pp. 19102-19108; Park, S., Jang, J., Sohn, J., 59102 effect analysis of vehicle handling performance due to camber angle change of front and rear suspension (vehicle dynamics & control including tire dynamics) (2010) The Proceedings of the Asian Conference on Multibody Dynamics, pp. 591021-591026. , 20105; Lu, Guo, K., Lu, D., Wang, Y., Effect of tire camber on vehicle dynamic simulation for extreme cornering (2006) Vehicle System Dynamics, 44 (1), pp. 39-49; Yuhara, N., Horiuchi, S., Arato, Y., A robust adaptative rear wheel steering control system for handling improvement of four-wheel steering vehicles (1992) Vehicle System Dynamics, 20 (1), pp. 666-680; Whitehead, J., Rear wheel steering dynamics compared to front steering (1990) Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control, 112 (1), pp. 88-93; Wang, E., Semi-active control of vehicle suspension with magnetorheological dampers part_-evaluation of suspension performance (2008) Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering (English Edition), 21 (2), p. 45; Valášek, M., Kortm, W., Mechatronic automotive suspension as friendly suspension (2000) IFAC Proceedings Volumes, 33 (26), pp. 151-156; Camber: What is it, how it works, and how can it make you faster (2020) Turnology, , https://www.turnology.com/tech-stories/brakes-suspension/camberwhat-is-it-and-how-can-it-make-youfaster/#:-:text=To%20make%20adjustments%20to%20a,laterally%20on%20a%20grooved%20track, [Accessed: 01-Jun-2020]; Repanich, N., INTRODUCTION to MOTOR SIZING, p. 8. , Chico, CA 95929-0789; Pacejka, H., Bakker, E., The magic formula tyre model (1992) Vehicle System Dynamics, 21 (1), pp. 1-18; Park, S., Sohn, J., Effects of camber angle control of front suspension on vehicle dynamic behaviors (2012) Journal of Mechanical Science and Technology, 26 (2), pp. 307-313; Online, A., Blhm5100kc-15 / blhd100k, 100 w (1/8 hp) brushless dc motor speed control system (15: 1 gear ratio) (24 vdc) (2020) Oriental Motor USA, , https://catalog.orientalmotor.com/item/blh-series-brushless-dc-motorspeed-control/100w-blh-brushless-dc-motor-speedcontrol/blhm5100kc-15-blhd100k, [Accessed: 04-Jun-2020]",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","7th International Conference on Information Technology, Computer, and Electrical Engineering, ICITACEE 2020","24 September 2020 through 25 September 2020",,164776,,9781728172255,,,"English","Int.

The problem is a lack of integrated information system to help the company in finding the successors of vacant positions and in mapping out the employee career path. Several methods were used in this research such as questionnaire and benchmarking with literature review. The questionnaire method consists of 16 questions which were based on Likert scale and literature benchmarking method that compared Evergreen Retirement Community, Boomers, and Brazilian Professionals to SME Sector. As for the information system design, Unified Modeling Language (UML) was utilized to produce use case diagram, sequence diagram, activity diagram, and entity relationship diagram (ERD) to help designing the user interface. The result of this research revealed an information system succession planning and career path model that is integrated and computerized to help companies in finding the successor for the vacant position and map out an employee career path. © 2016 IEEE.","career path; information system; succession planning; talent management","Benchmarking; Information systems; Modeling languages; Surveys; Systems analysis; Telecommunication services; Unified Modeling Language; User interfaces; Benchmarking methods; Career paths; Entity relationship diagrams; Information system model; Integrated information system; Literature reviews; Succession planning; Talent management; Information management",,,,,"Eshiteti, S.N., Okaka, O., Maragia, D.S., Odera, O., Akerele, E.K., Effects of succession planning programs on staff retention (2013) Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences, 4 (6), pp. 157-162; Chaves, L.D., Ferreira, J.B., Camelo, S.H., Balderrama, P., Tanaka, O.Y., Reflections on information systems in health (2014) Evaluative Search and Nursing.

The purpose of this research is to examine the two main factors of Solo towards tourist attraction. The research method is quantitative. Data collected from observation and survey. A total of 113 respondents obtained from accidental sampling method. The results indicate based on cognitive and affective image. Cognitive consists of culture, batik, city tagline, and community. While, affective consists of tradition, culinary, purposes, climate, and welcoming. The findings show that image has weak correlation towards tourist attraction of Solo. It means most of the tourists are not influenced by city image when they choose Solo as one of their travel destination. The differences between primary and minor image are also examined. Research implication is directed for local government to pursue continuous improvement particularly for the branding of Solo. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","affective; city image; cognitive; destination; tourism","affective; city image; cognitive; destination; tourism",,,,,"Martins, M., The tourist Imagery the Destination Image and the Brand Image (2015) Journal of Tourism and Hospitality Management, 3 (2), p. 1; Sia, J.K.M., Lew, T.Y., Sim, A.K.S., Miri city as a festival destination image in the context of Miri (2015) Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, 172, p. 68; Souiden, N., Ladhari, R., Chiadmi, N.E., Destination personality and destination image (2017) Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, 32, p. 54. , 55; Kani, Y., Aziz, Y.A., Sambasivan, M., Bojei, J., Antecedents and outcomes of destination image of Malaysia (2017) Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, 32, p. 89; Hernández-Mogollóna, J.M., Duarteb, P.A., Folgado-Fernándezc, J.A., The contribution of cultural events to the formation of the cognitive and affective images of a tourist destination (2017) Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, p. 2; Sia, J.K.M., Lewb, T.Y., Sim, A.K.S., Miri city as a festival destination image in the context of Miri Country Music Festival (2015) Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, 172, p. 68. , 69; Teodorescu, N., Stǎncioiu, A.F., Rǎvar, A.S., Boto, A., Creativity and innovation Sources of competitive advantage in the value chain of tourism enterprises (2015) Theoretical and Applied Economics, 22, p. 36; Manoa, A., Costa, R.A.D., A conceptual model of the antecedents and consequences of tourist destination image (2015) Procedia Economics and Finance 23, 23, p. 17; Martín-Santana, J.D., Beerli-Palacio, A., Nazzareno, P.A., Antecedents and consequences of destination image gap (2017) Annals of Tourism Research, 62, p. 13. , 15; Sam, S., Huang, J., Exploring Mainland Chinese students motivations of re-visiting Hong Kong as a familia place and their links to student life experiences (2016) Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, p. 2; Xu, J., Huang, S., Exploring Mainland Chinese students motivations of re-visiting Hong Kong as a familiar place and their links to student life experiences (2016) Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, p. 2; Swarbrooke, J., Horner, S., (2007) Consumer Behaviour in Tourism, , (Oxford: Elsevier)",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","4th International Conference on Friendly City 2017","11 October 2017 through 12 October 2017",,135340,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

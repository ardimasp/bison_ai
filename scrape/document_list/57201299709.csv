The idea is triggered by the company's efficiency program in information technology investment both infrastructure and application development so it enforce MahaDasha’s IT team to find out the best innovation solution by optimizing open source technology which suitable with the user's need. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of e-learning adoption based on open source moodle technology platform by developing The DeLone & McLean Information Success Model and empirically measured the relation between aspect of information quality, system quality, service quality, user readiness and user satisfaction. The quantitative data are gained through questionnaire by distributing the questionnaires to all MahaDasha employees who use e-learning. The analysis of data indicated that the user satisfaction is the most positive influenced by information quality and user readiness. The contribution of this research was performed by evaluation process both for quality of trainer and IT support team based on result of the research. In the other hand, the system quality had been re-reviewed whether moodle application is suitable or not for user needs in MahaDasha. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS","Application; E-learning; Knowledge management system; Learning management system; Open source",,,,,,"Jafari, S.M., Salem, S.F., Moaddab, M.S., Salem, S.O., Learning Management System (LMS) success: An investigation among the university students (2016) 2015 IEEE Conf.

It is essential for a company to make its employees satisfied and pleased with their jobs. These very satisfaction and pleasure are hoped to serve as a key for motivating employees to perform and contribute their best for the company. Numerous research studies have proven the positive effect of work well-being on job performance, but the findings came with inconsistencies and controversies. This fact has caused reluctance in a good many companies to invest in their employees’ work well-being. A survey of 509 millennial employees in the Indonesian startup digital industry was conducted in this research. The results show that employee’s work well-being had a significant, positive effect on job performance. Theoretically, this research has contributed in responding to inconsistencies in literature. It is hoped that this research will also offer practical contribution to individual employees as well as human resources department and increase company executives’ confidence in making organization-related strategic decisions to attain sustainable performance. Finally, we propose a number of intervention suggestions for performance improvement through work well-being. © 2020 by the authors;","Industrial Revolution; Job Performance; Millennial; Sustainable Performance; Work Well-being",,,,,,"Albuquerque, A.S., Troccoli, B.T., Development a measure of subjective well-being (2004) Psicologia, 20, pp. 153-164; Amelia, A., (2018) Employer Branding: When HR Is the New Marketing, , Jakarta, Indonesia: Penerbit Buku Kompas; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review of recommended two step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 411-423; (2012) Creating People Advantage: Mastering HR Challenges in A Two Speed World, , BCG; Bouckenooghe, D., Raja, U., Butt, A.N., Combined effect of positive and negative affectivity and job satisfaction on job performance and turnover intentions (2013) Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied, 147 (2), pp. 105-123; Campbell, J.P., Modeling the performance prediction problem in industrial and organizational psychology (1990) Handbook of Industrial and Organizational Psychology, pp. 687-732. , Dalam M.

In the digital business industry, innovative work behaviour has been considered as a key performance indicator. Individual performance becomes the basis of the company performance which will further increase the value of the company. This study employs the paradigm of positive psychology, focusing on how performance improvement can be achieved by increasing employee work well-being. Previous studies show that there is an inconsistency in the relationship between work well-being and performance. So, it needs to be understood further through the role of mediation variables that can explain when an employee work wellbeing can improve performance. This study aims to examine the role of employee organisational commitment as a mediator of the relationship between employee work well-being and innovative work behaviour. Taking the digital business industry in Indonesia as a research context, this research reveals that employee organisational commitment fully mediated the relationship between employee work well-being and innovative work behaviour.

However, research related to employee well-being and organizational commitment of millennial generation is still difficult to find in Indonesia. This study aims to investigate the role of psychological capital and organizational fit to employee well-being and organizational commitment of millennial employees in e-commerce industry in Indonesia. Data were collected through a survey of 288 millennial employees who work in e-commerce industry in Jakarta, Indonesia. By using structural equation modelling, we found that employee well-being and organizational commitment are positively associated with both psychological capital and organizational fit, while employee well-being also mediates the relationship between psychological capital and organizational fit toward organizational commitment. The results contribute to better understanding of attitude of millennial generation in general and specifically to the predictors of employee well-being and commitment at work, especially in e-commerce industry. Furthermore, this research also provides both theoretical and managerial implications explaining the contribution of human factors in e-commerce industry as well as limitations of this study and direction for future research. © IEOM Society International.","Business management; E-Commerce; Human factors; Millennial generation; Organizational commitment",,,,,,,"Nangoy, R.; Doctor of Research in Management, Indonesia; email: rizalmmgd@gmail.com",,"Eaton;INFORMS (Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences);Siemens","IEOM Society","8th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management, IEOM 2018","6 March 2018 through 8 March 2018",,138293,21698767,9781532359446,,,"English","Proc.

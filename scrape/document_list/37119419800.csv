The condition of the human body, e.g. the ECG signal, can be monitored regularly by means of a portable sensor device. The use of the machine learning algorithm would then provide an overview of a patient’s current health on a regular basis compared to a medical doctor’s diagnosis that can only be made during a hospital visit. This work aimed to develop an accurate model for classifying sleep stages by features of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) extracted from Electrocardiogram (ECG). The sleep stages classification can be utilized to predict the sleep stages proportion. Where sleep stages proportion information can provide an insight of human sleep quality. The integration of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was utilized for selecting features and determining the number of hidden nodes. The results were compared to Support Vector Machine (SVM) and ELM methods which are lower than the integration of ELM with PSO. The results of accuracy tests for the combined ELM and PSO were 62.66%, 71.52%, 76.77%, and 82.1% respectively for 6, 4, 3, and 2 classes. To sum up, the classification accuracy can be improved by deploying PSO algorithm for feature selection. © 2021, The Author(s).","Electrocardiogram; Extreme learning machine; Heart rate variability; Particle swarm optimization; Sleep stages",,,,,"039/VR","This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Prototipe dan Aplikasi Monitoring Kualitas Tidur Portabel berbasis Teknologi Cloud Computing dan Machine Learning” or “Portable Sleep Quality Monitoring Prototype and Application based on Cloud Computing Technology and Machine Learning” with contract number: 039/VR.RTT/IV/2019 and contract date: 29 April 2019.",,"Hirshkowitz, M., National Sleep Foundation 2013 poll (2013) Sleep Heal; Tibbitts, G.M., Sleep disorders: causes, effects, and solutions (2008) Prim Care Clin Off Pract, 35, pp. 817-837; Kales, A., Rechtschaffen, A., (1968) A manual of standardized terminology, techniques and scoring system for sleep stages of human subjects, , U.

Many studies have been done to find an arrhythmia classification algorithm which has satisfactory learning speed and accuracy. However, many of those result in unstable performances in addition to slow learning speed. This research uses the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database from the PhysioNet Resource which will be tested through three stages: preprocessing performed by resampling and scaling, feature extraction using Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), and classification using the method of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) which has a high learning speed and accuracy. This research is limited to five classes of arrythmia: Paced Beat (PB), Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB), Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and the normal heart condition Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR). The parameters of accuracy, sensitivity, and computation time are tested out of 125 test data. The result shows that arrhythmia classification using ELM has 100% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and average computation time of 0.107 seconds. This result is also compared with another method in supervised learning used in classifications called Support Vector Machine (SVM) to prove that ELM is the suggested approach.

In order to satisfy this requirement, many active queuing algorithms are offered, such as RED, BLUE, and controlled delay (CoDel). The number of publications aimed at evaluating the performance of the active queue management (AQM) algorithm is still limited by using a network simulator and only comparing two algorithms. The combination of AQM and connection types (fairness and no-fairness) in real network implementation has not been discussed much. In this paper, we offer a comparison of the performance of three queuing algorithms, namely DropTail, BLUE, and CoDel, with two types of connections, namely fairness and no-fairness using real network devices and internet video streaming access. Experiments carried out in the real network environment using Sandvine PL8840's bandwidth management device. The quality of services (QoS) parameters that will be compared are throughput, latency, and packet loss. The comparison results show that fairness connections on all queuing algorithms can maintain low latency values; throughput is smaller than no-fairness connections. The absence of packet loss in streaming video based on the TCP protocol does not guarantee that the video being played runs well because it depends on the available bandwidth capacity. © 2020 IEEE.","AQM; BLUE; CoDel; Droptail; QoS; RED","Bandwidth; Information management; Packet loss; Queueing networks; Video on demand; Video streaming; Active queue management algorithms; Available bandwidth; Bandwidth management; Comparison result; Network simulators; Queuing algorithms; Real-time internet; Video-on-demand applications; Queueing theory",,,,"Binus University","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The publication of this research work is supported by Bina Nusantara University.",,"Arsan, T., Bandwidth allocation and traffic shaping in mobile broadband networks using deep packet inspection (2016) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, 14 (8), pp. 1066-1074; (2018) Comparing Traffic Policing and Traffic Shaping for Bandwidth Limiting, , https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/quality-of-serviceqos/qos-policing/19645-policevsshape.pdf, October; Flach, T., Papageorge, P., Terzis, A., Pedrosa, L., Cheng, Y., Karim, T., Govindan, R., An internet-wide analysis of traffic policing (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on ACM SIGCOMM 2016 Conference-SIGCOMM '16, pp. 468-482. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2934872.2934873; Innocentkechukwu, U., A survey on bandwidth management techniques via the osi model network and application layers (2017) Global Journal of Computer Science and Technology, , https://computerresearch.org/index.php/computer/article/view/1650; Karimah, S.A., Putrada, A.G., Rianda, F., Performansi algoritma proportional integral controlled enhanced (pie) dan droptail pada layanan voip (2019) Indonesia Journal on Computing, 4, pp. 119-132; Li, M., Wang, H., Science, C., Study of Active Queue Management Algorithms; Maratsolas, K.P.E., Video activity-based traffic policing: A new paradigm (2014) IEEE Transaction on Multimedia., 16, pp. 1446-1459; Mohammed, H., Attiya, G., El-Dolil, S., Active queue management for congestion control: Performance evaluation, new approach, and comparative study (2017) International Journal of Computing and Network Technology, 5 (2), pp. 37-49. , http://dx.doi.org/10.12785/IJCNT/050201; Mohammed, S.B.A., Dajab, D.D., Mu'Zu, M.B., Policy creation model for policy based bandwidth management in the core network (a case study of abu data network) (2013) International Journal of Computer Application, 68, pp. 1-6; Singh, G., Nagar, Y., Comparing different active queue management techniques (2015) International Journal of Emerging Research in Management &Technology, 4 (5), pp. 50-56; Solomon, T., Zungeru, A.M., Selvaraj, R., Mangwala, M., A packet distribution traffic model for industrial application: A case of biust network (2017) Internation Journal of Information and Electronics Engineering., 7, pp. 136-140; Solomon, T., Zungeru, Selvaraj, R.A.M., Phakedi, Olefile, Bagwasi, O., Policy-based network management in biust network (2017) American Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences, 10 (3), pp. 661-668; Thato Solomon, A.M., A packet distribution traffic model for industrial application: A case of biust network (2017) International Journal of Information and Electronics Engineering, pp. 136-140; Vimaladevi, B., Manju, Optimizing of video streaming through bufferbload mitigation using hybrid fq-codel algorithm (2016) International Journal of Computer Applications, 142, pp. 33-36; Zhang, W., Ye, S., Li, B., Zhao, H., Zheng, Q., A priority-based adaptive scheme for multi-view live streaming over http (2016) Computer Communications, 85, pp. 89-97. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comcom.2016.04.001; Wairisal, M., Surantha, N., Design and evaluation of efficient bandwidth management for a corporate network (2018) 2018 International Conference on Information Management and Technology (ICIMTech), pp. 98-102. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIMTech.2018.8528162",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","5th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2020","13 August 2020 through 14 August 2020",,163671,,9781728170718,,,"English","Proc.

The research uses simplified structural models to explore the sensitivity of the index to damages, to compare the index performance with a traditional but popular damage detection method, and to understand the local/global predictive capability of the index. The research uses two simple models, namely, single- and two-degree-of-freedom systems. The results suggest that the damage index is local, that can only monitor damages occurring near the points of measurements, but it is sensitive to damages, unlike the natural frequency, which is global but less sensitive. © 2020 Author(s).","Damage Index; General Vibration Method; Mode Shape; Natural Frequency; Structural Health Monitoring",,,,,,,,"Xu, Y., Brownjohn, J.M., Hester, D., Enhanced sparse component analysis for operational modal identification of real-life bridge structures (2019) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 116, pp. 585-605; Perez, M.A., Serra-Lopez, R., A frequency domain-based correlation approach for structural assessment and damage identification (2019) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 119, pp. 432-456. , 2019; Chang, C.M., Lin, T.K., Chang, C.W., Applications of neural network models for structural health monitoring based on derived modal properties (2018) Measurement, 129, pp. 457-470; Gunawan, F.E., Improving the reliability of F-statistic method by using linear support vector machine for structural health monitoring (2018) ICIC Express Letters, 12, pp. 1183-1193; Gomes, G.F., De Almeida, F.A., Junqueira, D.M., Da Cunha, S.S., Jr., Ancelotti, A.C., Jr., Optimized damage identification in CFRP plates by reduced mode shapes and GA-ANN methods (2019) Engineering Structures, 181, pp. 111-123; Zhao, R., Yan, R., Chen, Z., Mao, K., Wang, P., Gao, R.X., (2019) TITLE Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 115, pp. 213-237; Khodabandehlou, H., Pekcan, G., Fadali, M.S., (2019) Structural Control and Health Monitoring, 26, p. e2308; Gunawan, F.E., Soewito, B., Surantha, N., Mauritsius, T., One more reason to reject manuscript about machine learning for structural health monitoring (2018) 2018 Indonesian Association for Pattern Recognition International Conference (INAPR)., pp. 62-66. , IEEE, 2018; Zhang, C., Cheng, L., Qiu, Q., Ji, H., Ji, J., Deep learning and its applications to machine health monitoring (2019) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 123, pp. 316-332; Farrar, C.R., Worden, K., (2012) Structural Health Monitoring: A Machine Learning Perspective., , John Wiley & Sons; Kopsaftopoulos, F., Fassois, S., Vibration based health monitoring for a lightweight truss structure: Experimental assessment of several statistical time series methods (2010) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 24, pp. 1977-1997; Kopsaftopoulos, F.P., Fassois, S.D., Scalar and vector time series methods for vibration based damage diagnosis in a scale aircraft skeleton structure (2011) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, 49, pp. 727-756. , 2011; Fassois, S.D., Sakellariou, J.S., Time-series methods for fault detection and identification in vibrating structures (2007) Philosophical Transactions of Royal Society A, 365, pp. 411-448","Gunawan, F.E.; Industrial Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: fgunawan@binus.edu","NahryMarthanty D.R.",,"American Institute of Physics Inc.","16th International Conference on Quality in Research, QiR 2019 - 2019 International Symposium on Advances in Mechanical Engineering, ISAME 2019","22 July 2019 through 24 July 2019",,164750,0094243X,9780735419865,,,"English","AIP Conf.

This research focuses on the reliability of the Power Spectral Density (PSD) method via the use of the F statistic for damage detection. To the author best knowledge, the method is rather classic but its realibility has not been discussed in the context of a large data size. Priory, the research anticipates that the accuracy is a function of the damage level. In this study, we evaluate 3500 cases with five levels of structural integrity, namely, healthy condition and damaged conditions with 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20% damage levels. The dataset is established via a numerical analysis of a seven degree-of-freedom system loaded with a concentrated dynamic force with random magnitude. A spring on the system is reduced in its stiffness to simulate damages. Our significant findings are the following: it is challenging for the PSD-based method to differentiate the healthy condition from the damaged conditions when the damage level is small. However, the reliability is high at 95% probability when the structural integrity has dropped by five percent. © 2020 Author(s).",,,,,,,,,"Gunawan, F.E., (2018) ICIC Express Letters, 12, pp. 1183-1193; Gopalakhrishnan, S., Ruzzene, M., Hanagud, S., (2011) Computational Techniques for Structural Health Monitoring., , Springer; Higgins, S., Inspection of steel-tired wheels (1895) Proceedings of New York Railroad; Farrar, C.R., Worden, K., (2012) Structural Health Monitoring: A Machine Learning Perspective, , John Wiley & Sons; Gunawan, F.E., Soewito, B., Surantha, N., Mauritsius, T., One more reason to reject manuscript about machine learning for structural health monitoring (2018) 2018 Indonesian Association for Pattern Recognition International Conference (INAPR), pp. 62-66; Khodabandehlou, H., Pekcan, G., Fadali, M.S., (2019) Structural Control and Health Monitoring, 26, p. e2308; Chang, C.-M., Lin, T.-K., Chang, C.-W., (2018) Measurement, 129, pp. 457-470; Gomes, G.F., De Almeida, F.A., Junqueira, D.M., Da Cunha, S.S., Jr., Ancelotti, A.C., Jr., (2019) Engineering Structures, 181, pp. 111-123; Zhang, C., Cheng, L., Qiu, J., Ji, H., Ji, J., (2019) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 123, pp. 316-332; Fassois, S.D., Sakellariou, J.S., (2007) Philosophical Transactions of Royal Society A, 365, pp. 411-448; Kopsaftopoulos, F., Fassois, S., (2010) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 24, pp. 1977-1997; Kopsaftopoulos, F.P., Fassois, S.D., (2011) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, 49, pp. 727-756; Valverde-Albacete, F.J., Peláez-Moreno, C., (2014) PloS One, 9, p. 84217; Worden, K., Farrar, F.R., Manson, G., Park, G., Proceedings of the royal society of london a: Mathematical (2007) Physical and Engineering Sciences, 463, pp. 1639-1664; Schilling, R.J., Harris, S.L., (2011) Fundamentals of Digital Signal Processing Using MATLAB., , Cengage Learning; Gunawan, F.E., (2016) Inverse Problems in Science and Engineering, 24, pp. 1107-1132; Powers, D.M.W., (2007) Evaluation: From Precision, Recall, and F-factor to ROC, Informedness, Markedness & Correlation, School of Informatics and Engineering, , Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia, Technical Report SIE-07-001; Alamdari, M.M., (2015) Vibration-based Structural Health Monitoring, , PhD thesis, University of Technology, Sydney, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering; Salawu, O., (1997) Engineering Structures, 19, pp. 718-723","Gunawan, F.E.; Industrial Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: fgunawan@binus.edu","NahryMarthanty D.R.",,"American Institute of Physics Inc.","16th International Conference on Quality in Research, QiR 2019 - 2019 International Symposium on Advances in Mechanical Engineering, ISAME 2019","22 July 2019 through 24 July 2019",,164750,0094243X,9780735419865,,,"English","AIP Conf.

It results in an increase in the number of car accidents, lower productivity and a higher risk of chronic disease. Advancing wearable and contactless health sensors offers the possibility of daily sleep quality monitoring that can be done on a regular basis by patients in their homes. The goal of this research is to propose the design of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) sleep quality monitoring system that can be integrated with a wearable or contactless sensor. The proposed platform architecture is based on micro-services and is event-driven. The simulation results show that the implementation of the IoT sleep quality monitoring system based on the proposed design decreases the response time by 55.85 per cent while increasing the throughput by 34.76 per cent compared to the traditional approach. On the other hand, the rate of increase in memory usage per instance replication for proposed method is lower than the traditional method. © 2020 IEEE.","Event-Driven; Health Monitoring; Internet-of-Things; Microservices; Sleep Quality","Accidents; Monitoring; Sleep research; Springs (components); Wearable sensors; Contactless sensors; Internet of Things (IOT); Number of peoples; Platform architecture; Rate of increase; Resource-efficient; Sleep monitoring; Traditional approaches; Internet of things",,,,"039/VR","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Portable Sleep Quality Monitoring Prototype and Application based on Cloud Computing Technology and Machine Learning” with contract number: 039/VR.RTT/IV/2019 and contract date: 29 April 2019.",,"Surantha, N., Kusuma, G.P., Isa, S.M., Internet of things for sleep quality monitoring system: A survey (2017) Proceedings-11th 2016 International Conference on Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems, KICSS 2016; Kim, M., Asthana, M., Bhargava, S., Iyyer, K.K., Tangadpalliwar, R., Gao, J., Developing an on-demand cloud-based sensing-as-a-service system for internet of things (2016) J.

Therefore, a new solution for modern agriculture is needed to overcome this problem. Technology is useful for modern agriculture, such as the use of IoT for hydroponic farming systems. By using IoT with a smart controlling system, the hydroponic agriculture becomes easier. With the use of IoT in this research, nutrition, pH management, and temperature can be controlled easily. This research also uses fuzzy logic to make the decision making in the control system more efficient and precise. The results of experiments with bok choy and lettuce indicate that the system automatically measures the nutritional value and pH according to the time specified. Then, the system will immediately adjust the value of nutrient content and pH within the specified range. Smart control system shows better plant growth which can be seen from the growth of the leaves’ width, length and plant’s height. © 2020 ICIC International.","Fuzzy logic; Hydroponics; IoT; Smart controlling systems; Urban farming","Agriculture; Computer circuits; Control systems; Decision making; Internet of things; Nutrition; Plants (botany); Agricultural land; Agricultural productions; Controlling system; Hydroponics; Modern agricultures; Nutritional value; Smart control systems; Urban farming; Fuzzy logic",,,,"038/VR","Acknowledgment.

These factors or variables are needed to build a classification model of the hypertension dataset. In the construction of classification models, class imbalance problems are often found due to oversampling. This research aims to obtain the best classification model by implementing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method to get the optimal level of accuracy. The dataset consists of 8 features and a label with two classes: hypertensive and non-hypertensive. Overall test result performance is then compared to assess between SVM combined with SMOTE and not. The results show that SMOTE can improve the accuracy of the model for unbalanced data into 98% accuracy compared to 91% accuracy without SMOTE. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

To diagnose this abnormality, the arrhythmia expert or cardiologist uses an electrocardiogram (ECG) by analyzing the pattern. ECG is a heartbeat signal that is produced by a tool called an electrocardiograph sensor that records the electrical impulses produced by the heart. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is often used by researchers to classify ECG signals to Arryhtmia classes. The state-of-the-art research had applied CNN 2D (CNN 2D) with accuracy up to 99% with 128x128 image size obtained by transforming the ECG signal. In this paper, authors try to classify arrhythmia disorder with a different approach by creating simpler image classifier using CNN 2D with a smaller variety of input size that is smaller than state-the-art input and group the classes based on transformed ECG signal from MIT- BIH Arrhythmia database with the purpose to know what the most optimum input and the best accuracy to classify ECG signal image. The result of this research had produced an accuracy of up to 98.91% for 2 Classes, 98.10% for 7 Classes dan 98.45% for 8 Classes. © 2020 Science and Information Organization.","Arrhythmia; CNN; CNN 2D; Convolutional neural network; Ecg; Electrocardiogram; Image classifier",,,,,,"This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research and Technology, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Dasar Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled ""Sistem dan Aplikasi Portabel Pendeteksi Gangguan Irama Jantung Menggunakan Sinyal ECG Berbasis Machine Learning dan Cloud Computing"" or ""Portable ECG-based Heart Arrhythmia Prediction System and Application using Machine Learning and Cloud Computing.""",,"Humphreys, M., Warlow, C., McGowan, J., ""Arrhythmias and their Management,"" (2013) Nurs.

Personal healthcare device such as ECG senses very sensitive voltage from heart and stream the data in high speed to the IoT platform. Data from ECG can be used for many disease diagnoses, including Arrhythmia and sleep disorder. In order to obtain the optimum diagnosis result, IoT platform for healthcare should be able to handle very rapid data stream from users or devices simultaneously and keep the successful connections at a high rate. In this paper, an IoT architecture for healthcare implementing asynchronous processing is proposed. Asynchronous process allows the system to process the data outside the main loop of process. The proposed system measures HTTP successful connections and analytics accuracy. By implementing asynchronous processing, the system can increase the successful HTTP connection up to 50% for 100 users testing scenario compared to the benchmark system.

The development of wearables and its sensor enables the possibility of easy-to-use real-time monitoring. The goal of this study is to improve an IoT monitoring system by enabling real-time heart rate monitoring and analysis, also to assess the use of PPG sensors in smart wearables compared to other clinical-tested heart rate sensors. The PPG sensor will be used to record heart rate data of the user physically. The measurements are then sent to the application for pre-processing. The application can then transmit the pre-processed measurements to the cloud server for monitoring or further analysis, i.e. to assess the health of users' heart. The measurement comparison with measurement collected by a BCG sensor is carried out in this paper.

Smart sleep monitoring systems have become a solution to tackle this problem, where the system needs to be accessible at any time and condition by multiple users bringing the needs of the high availability and throughput of the system. Containerization has become a trending topic in software development where the container concept has solved many problems of virtual machines such as cost reduction, fewer CPU needed, and CPU utilization has been improved. Many containers have been around since then, and the most famous widely used is Docker. With its extra lightweight, fast, and highly portable characteristics, docker can be run anywhere on all platforms like Linux and Windows distribution. There are so many container orchestrations that can be used to manage docker containers, such as Swarm, Kubernetes, and Nomad. The purpose of this research is to propose Kubernetes as the container orchestration for the implementation in the real-life scenario. The result shows us that Kubernetes gives a good result in availability, flexibility, and scalability compared to the other container orchestration in developing and delivering products. © ICIC International 2020.","Container; Container orchestration; Internet of Things; Kubernetes; Sleep monitoring",,,,,"039/VR","Acknowledgment.

Guard interval (GI) is used in OFDM system to reduce inter-symbol interference (ISI). As selection of the length of guard interval depends on the channel condition, the length of guard interval will change dynamically. Thus there must be a way to synchronize this parameter between the transmitter and the receivers. Traditional OFDM systems require a transmitter to notify its receivers using additional signal and thus result additional bandwidth. However, the length of guard interval is usually fixed in conventional OFDM system, which decreases the power and spectrum efficiency considerably, especially in a mobile environment. To solve this problem, an OFDM system with variable guard interval is proposed in this paper. This system first utilizes the preamble and pilot sub-carriers of each OFDM packet burst to estimate the channel RMS delay spread, and then the result is fed into the guard interval controller. Then, the controller uses a criterion to calculate the guard interval and control the OFDM transmitter. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Signal receivers; Transmitters; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Channel conditions; Design and simulation; Guard intervals; High throughput; Mobile environments; Rms delay spread; Spectrum efficiency; Wireless broadband; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing",,,,,,,"(2003) Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications Amendment 4: Further Higher Data Rate Extension in the 2.4 GHz Band, , IEEE Std 802.11g.-2003 IEEE, Tech.

Therefore, a landless planting method is needed to supply the food for society. Hydroponics is one of the solutions for gardening methods using water as a nutrition media. Traditionally, hydroponic farming conducted manually by monitoring the nutrition such as acidity or basicity (pH), the value of total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), and nutrient temperature. In this research, we propose a system that measures pH, TDS, and nutrient temperature values in the nutrient film technique (NFT) technique using a couple of sensors. We use lettuce as an object of experiment and apply the KNN (k-Nearest Neighbor) algorithm to predict the classification of nutrient conditions. The result of prediction is used to provide a command to the microcontroller to turn on or off the nutrition controller actuators simultaneously at a time. The experiment result shows that the proposed KNN algorithm achieves 93.3% accuracy when k=5. © 2019 IEEE.","Hydroponic; k-nearest neighbor; pH; TDS","Alkalinity; Controllers; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Man machine systems; Motion compensation; Nutrients; Nutrition; pH; Text processing; Crowded urban areas; Electrical conductivity; Hydroponic; K-nearest neighbors; Nutrient conditions; Nutrient film techniques; Temperature values; Total dissolved solids; Nearest neighbor search",,,,,,,"Roser, M., Hannah, R., Ortiz-Ospina, E., World population growth (2019) Our World in Data, , https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth, [Online]; Ritxchie, H., Roser, M., Urbanization (2018) Our World in Data, , https://ourworldindata.org/urbanization, [Online]; Roberto, K., (2000) How-To Hydroponics, , Third.

In this study, we developed an indoor air quality monitoring system to detect and dispose bad air out of the room. Proposed system applied internet of things concept to do monitoring of air quality for gases of carbon dioxide (CO2) and PM10 gases. The sensors of CO2 and PM10 are connected to Arduino UNO to process analog to digital signal.This system has a mamdani fuzzy logic rule to efficiently set the working interval of exhaust fan. To process fuzzy logic rules, it used Raspberry Pi 3 in this proposed system.Based on result, Proposed System can maintain PM10 and CO2 AQI for safety level in longer periods compared to the system that used sugeno fuzzy logic system. For AQI PM10 values, if using the proposed system in 30 minutes, the interval of safe AQI values obtained in 30 minutes is for 1501 seconds. Whereas the safe AQI value interval obtained with fuzzy sugeno system only 1018 seconds. And for the value of AQI CO2, if using the system in 30 minutes, the interval of safe AQI value obtained in 30 minutes is for 816 seconds. Whereas the safe AQI value interval obtained with fuzzy sugeno system only 686 seconds. © IJSTR 2019.","AQI; Arduino Uno; Exhaust Fan; Fuzzy Logic; Indoor Air Quality; Internet of Things; Raspberry Pi 3",,,,,,,,"Cincinelli, A., Martellini, T., Indoor Air Quality and Health (2017) International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 14 (11), p. 1286; Kankaria, A., Indoor Air Pollution in India: Implications on Health and its Control (2014) Indian Journal of Community Medicine, 39 (4), pp. 203-207; Marcella, U., The Effect of Indoor Temperature and CO2 Levels on Cognitive Performance of Adult Females in Universitas Building in Saudi Arabia (2017) International Conference-Future Buildings & Districts-Energy Efficiency from Nano to Urban Scale, 122, pp. 451-456; ASHRAE/ANSI Standard 62.I-2013 Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality [Online], , http://www.myiaire.com/product-docs/ultraDRY/ASHRAE62.1.pdf, Available; Mukesh, D.M., Akula, S.K., Automated Indoor Air Quality Monitor and Control (2017) International Journal of Computer Applications, 159 (6), pp. 0975-8887; Malche, T., Maheshwary, P., Internet of Things (IoT) for building smart home system (2017) 2017 International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud), pp. 65-70; Preethicandra, D.M.G., Design of a smart indoor air quality monitoring wireless sensor network for assisted living (2013) IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference(I2MTC); Dobbin, A., The Benefit of kitchen exhaust fan use after cooking-An experimental assesment (2018) Building and Evirontment, 135, pp. 286-296; Kumar, S., Jasuja, A., Air quality monitoring system based on IoT using Raspberry Pi (2017) 2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation, pp. 1341-1346; Shu, M., Tang, M., Yang, M., Wei, N., The Vital Signs Real-Time Monitoring System Based on Internet of Things (2017) 2017 4th International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering, pp. 747-751; Gupta, M.S.D., Patchava, V., Menezes, V., Healthcare based on IoT using Raspberry Pi (2015) 2015 International Conference on Green Computing and Internet of Things, pp. 796-799; Naba, A., (2009) Belajar cepat fuzzy logic menggunakan Matlab, , Yogyakarta: Andi; Suyanto, (2007) Artificial Intelligence, Searching, Planning and Learning, , Bandung: Informatika Bandung; Sharma, V., Two Ways Ducting System Using Fuzzy Logic Control System (2013) 2013 International Journal of Electronics and Communication Engineering & Technology (IJECET); Batubara, S., Analisis Perbandingan Metode Fuzzy Mamdani Dan Fuzzy Sugeno Untuk Penentuan Kualitas Cor Beton Instan (2017) IT Journal Researrch and Development, 2 (1), p. 644",,,,"International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research",,,,,22778616,,,,"English","Int.

These kinds of plants need a precise amount of nutrient and water every time to grow ideally. Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a technology that enables regular monitoring of every aspect of human life. It can be a solution to monitor the water and nutrition needs of the plants periodically.

Indoor air pollution is 2-5 times larger than outdoors, but people still do not care about it. Currently, people open the window or use an exhaust fan to refresh the air condition inside the room. However, people sometimes are too busy to pay attention to the air quality inside the room. Therefore, automation is required to bring the air quality into the required level. This study discussed indoor air quality monitoring and controlling system that can monitor the air condition and control the air condition using an exhaust fan.

Traditional home security systems, i.e., Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) can only capture and record videos without the ability of giving warning feedback if there is any suspicious object. Therefore, an additional object detection and warning method is required. The proposed design is implemented using Raspberry Pi 3 and Arduino, that is connected by USB cable. The PIR sensor is installed on Arduino and webcam is mounted on Raspberry Pi 3. The Raspberry Pi 3 is used to process inputs from sensors and process images for human detection. PIR sensor detects the movement around the sensor to activate the webcam to capture a picture. Then, the object recognition is performed using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect the suspicious object. If the suspicious object is detected, then the alarm is activated and sends an email to warn the house owner about the existence of the intruder. The results show that it takes on average 2 seconds for the proposed system to detect an intruder and that the system can successfully detect the intruder with accuracy of 90%. © 2019 Nico Surantha and Wingky R.

Physical security could be improved through the implementation of indoor positioning with a real-time monitoring system. Other than security needs, the information provided could be used for emergency evacuation purposes in a disastrous situation. Presently, indoor positioning is principally based on wireless signals, such as WiFi, RFID, Zigbee, Bluetooth, etc. This study designs a user access management system in the Data Center using indoor-positioning. For the indoor positioning method, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbor (FkNN) algorithms and Kalman Filter implementation are evaluated. The simulation result shows that the proposed method can improve the positioning accuracy until 8% compared to the existing method. © 2019 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.","Bluetooth Low Energy; Fuzzy kNN; Indoor Positioning; Kalman Filter; RSSI",,,,,,,,"Salas, A.C., (2014) Indoor Positioning System Based on Bluetooth Low Energy, , Degree's Thesis Submitted to the Faculty of the Escola Tècnica d'Enginyeria de Telecomunicació de Barcelona Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Barcelona; Kriz, P., Maly, F., Kozel, T., Improving Indoor Localization Using Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons (2016) Mobile Information Systems, pp. 1-11. , http://dx.doi.org/DOI:10.1155/2016/2083094; Sukhov, R.R., Amzakarov, M.B., Isaev, E.A., Advanced Data Center Economy (2013) Business Informatic, 2 (24), pp. 13-18; Dumsky, D.V., Isaev, E.A., Data centers for physical research (2015) Physics Procedia, 71, pp. 298-302. , http://dx.doi.org/DOI:10.1016/j.phpro.2015.08.330, Elsevier B.V; Lin, X.Y., Ho, T.W., Fang, C.C., Yen, Z.S., Yang, B.J., Lai, F., A mobile indoor positioning system based on iBeacon technology (2015) Proceedings of the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, 2015, pp. 4970-4973. , https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319507, EMBS, Milan; Van, H.T., Poorter, E.D., Crombez, P., Lemic, F., Handziski, V., Wirström, N., Wolisz, A., Moerman, I., Performance analysis of multiple Indoor Positioning Systems in a healthcare environment (2016) International Journal of Health Geographics, 15 (7), pp. 1-15. , https://doi.org/10.1186/s12942doi.org/10.1186/s12942-016-0034-z; Soewito, B., Wiguna, A., Suharjito, S., Diana, D., Bluetooth Low Energy: Comparing 4 Trilateration Models in Indoor Positioning System (2018) International Journal on Communications Antenna and Propagation (IRECAP), 8 (6), pp. 500-509. , https://doi.org/10.15866/irecap.v8i6.13476; Yang, Z., Liu, Y., Quality of Trilateration: Confidence-Based Iterative Localization (2010) IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 21 (5), pp. 631-640. , May; Zhuang, Y., Yang, J., Li, Y., Qi, L., El-Sheimy, N., Smartphone-based indoor localization with bluetooth low energy beacons (2016) Sensors (Switzerland), 16 (5), pp. 1-20. , https://doi.org/10.3390/s16050596; Hansen, R., Thomsen, B., Thomsen, L.L., Adamsen, F.S., SmartCampusAAU-an open platform enabling indoor positioning and navigation (2013) Proceedings of 14Th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management, 2, pp. 33-38; Karlsson, F., Karlsson, M., Bernhardsson, B., Tufvesson, F., Persson, M., Sensor fused indoor positioning using dual-band WiFi signal measurements (2015) Proceedings of European Control Conference (ECC), Linz, pp. 1669-1672; Zafari, F., Papapanagiotou, I., Enhancing iBeacon Based Micro-Location with Particle Filtering (2015) Proceedings of IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 1, pp. 1-7. , San Diego, CA; Deepesh, P.C., Akshay Tiwary, R.R., Vikram, N., Rao, and N.

Due to the difference in sleep stage proportion for every person, the collected sleep stage data are imbalanced naturally, which can lead to high probability of misclassification. Various learning method has been developed to classify sleep stage based on electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no researches which consider the imbalanced dataset problem for sleep stage classification. In this research, a classification model of sleep stage based on ECG signal was developed using Weighted Extreme Machine Learning (WELM) to deal with imbalanced learning dataset and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. The research will use the MIT-BIH Polysomnographic Database, which contains 10154 sleep stage annotated ECG data which consist of 17.79%, 38.28%, 4.76%, 1.78%, 6.89%, and 30.5% data of NREM1, NREM2, NREM3, NREM4, REM, and awake stage respectively. From each ECG record, a total of 18 features were extracted and the feature selection process resulted in 10 features which highly affect the sleep stage classification. The proposed model successfully obtained a mean accuracy of 78,78% for REM, NREM and Wake stage classification and 73.09% for Light Sleep, Deep Sleep, REM, and Wake stage classification. © 2019 The Authors.

Scrum methodology commonly used to overcome uncertain condition and tight deadline. Scrum consists of three roles, they are product owner, development team, and scrum master. Scrum can be implemented on many areas such as development of education mobile application, integration of document management system, strengthen IT development centers, and many others. The successful of Scrum implementation depends on the skill and knowledge of the team members. The Scrum also has several risk factors and therefore needs risk management approaches. A comparison between agile and waterfall model is also discussed. The Scrum performance can also be tested with certain ways. Scrum used to make sure that all parts of the software can be delivered on time. The other benefits, scrum can make creative and productive workplace, and scrum can also increase business value. © 2019, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

In this research, we propose a classification method on the basis of the general vibration model. The general vibration model is essentially a set of differential equations describing the dynamics of the structure under consideration. For the purpose of damage detection, a deviation of the general vibration model from the dynamic equilibrium point marks the occurrence of the damage. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we study two simplest dynamical systems consisting of one- and two-concentrated masses subjected to a prescribed dynamic load. The structural damages are introduced artificially by reducing the stiffness of spring in the structures. We find that the general vibration model is more sensitive to damages than the traditional methods. © 2019 The Authors.

For a reason, recently, many attempts have been endured to reduce the emission and to increase fuel efficiency, including vehicle platooning, better driving strategy, and increasing engine efficiency. This study intends to provide a more detail assessment regarding the effects of the driving strategy to fuel consumption. For the purpose, the vehicle dynamics are quantified by employing the car-following model based on the optimal velocity model. The fuel consumption is estimated from the regression model of Ahn18. The result suggests that the braking distance strongly affects fuel consumption. © 2019 The Authors.

FMEA is widely used in a design, a manufacturing or assembly process, or a product and service for identifying all possible failures. Risk identification is part of risk management. Therefore it is a critical first step of it. This paper is a case study on XYZ University which trying to implement risk management which only focused on how to identify the risk using FMEA. FMEA needs some parameters to be defined which are severity values, the likelihood of occurrence, and detection. Risk Priority Number (RPN) is a matrix that indicates potential risk calculated by multiplying the three components, and it used to classify which should be taken care of first based on the highest RPN value. Filtering the ticketing system and mapped the incidents that happened to the current business process is how the data collected, also the interview to end user for validation. The result of this paper is astonishing because it is different from the initial expectation that business process like LMS or network facility will get the highest RPN value, but after doing all the process, it is found that telecommunication is at the top.

At the core of the system lies an algorithm for classification of damages. This work intends to establish such an algorithm. In the current proposal, the algorithm receives data of the probe vehicle rate of rotations, extracts statistics descriptive from the data to produce a feature vector, and finally, feeds the vector to a simple-three-layer neural network to classify the damages. The types of damages are limited to four cases: normal, pothole, speed bump, and expansion joint. For the development, a probe vehicle is used to produce 400 empirical data involving those four damage cases. By using Monte Carlo approach, the established neural network model is evaluated. The results show that the approach is able to classify the cases with 85% accuracy. The study also finds that the rates of pitch and roll to be the determining factors. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The design is performed using top-down network design that considers the business and technical goals of the corporate. In order to improve the bandwidth utilization efficiency, we evaluate few traffic shaping methods in terms of bandwidth utilization, packet loss, and latency.

Quality of service will have an effect on the accomplishment of an organization's aim. Suitable and precise evaluation model will help the vocational high school in arranging a master plan to enhance the quality of education services provided. Kirkpatrick's model became the fundamental framework in this case study. This model was usually utilized to evaluate the impact of corporate training to the development of staff and also the impact to organization performance. In this paper, we perform case study for one of the vocational high school in Jakarta. There is a concern from the school about how to conduct evaluation of the teaching activity, students performance, and institution performance. In this paper, we propose a web-based e-learning system using Kirkpatrick evaluation model to solve this problem. We built the e-learning application using codeigniter framework. From the result, it can be seen that the developed system can provide platform for the school to evaluate the quality of teaching activity based on the students feedback, evaluate the performance of students after attending class, and also evaluate how the trend of institution performance year by year. © 2018 IEEE.","codeigniter; e-learning; Kirkpatrick model; software engineering","Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Education computing; Information management; Personnel training; Quality of service; Software engineering; Students; Websites; codeigniter; e-Learning application; Kirkpatrick modeling; Kirkpatrick's models; Organization performance; Quality of education; Teaching activities; Web-based e-learning systems; Quality control",,,,"Binus University","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The publication of this research work is supported by Bina Nusantara University.",,"Indonesia, P.R., Peraturan Pemerintah Republik Indonesia nomor 19 tahun 2005 tentang standar nasional pendidikan Departemen Pendidikan Nasional Republik Indonesia, 2005; Mathison, S., (2005) Encyclopedia of Evaluation, , Sage; Praslova, L., Adaptation of Kirkpatricks four level model of training criteria to assessment of learning outcomes and program evaluation in Higher Education (2010) Educ.

The proposed method is the combination of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection and hidden node number determination. The combination of ELM and PSO produces mean of testing accuracy of 82.1 %, 76.77%, 71.52 %, and 62.66% for 2, 3, 4, and 6 number of classes respectively. This paper also provides comparison to ELM and Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods whose testing accuracy is lower than the combination of ELM and PSO. Based on the results, can be concluded that the addition of PSO method is able to increase classification performance. © 2018 IEEE.","component; ECG; HRV; sleep stages","Electrocardiography; Sleep research; Support vector machines; Classification models; Classification performance; component; Electrocardiogram signal; Extreme learning machine; Heart rate variability; Optimal accuracy; Sleep stage; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",,,,,,,"Hirshkowitz, M., (2013) 2013 Exercise and Sleep Poll-National Sleep Foundation, , https://sleepfoundation.org/sites/default/files/RPT336%20Summary%20of%20Findings%2002%2020%202013.pdf, 20 February.

It includes user access and traffic management. Monitoring people positions, in the Data Center, will be more efficient with the indoor positioning system. Beside to security needs, indoor positioning system should be used for emergency evacuation needs in the Data Center. Indoor positioning has its challenges where global positioning system (GPS) becomes ineffective when used indoors because of no line of sight (LOS) with satellite. Currently, the indoor positioning is mainly based on the wireless signal, such as WiFi, RFID, Zigbee, Bluetooth, etc. In this paper, indoor positioning is developed based on Bluetooth 4.0 beacon technology and its RSSI value. As the classifier, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbors (FkNN) algorithm are evaluated. Impact of Kalman Filter application to improve the accuracy also being tested. The simulation results shows that the performance of FkNN is better than kNN. While, Kalman Filter can improve the performance of kNN significantly. © 2018 IEEE.","Bluetooth Low Energy; FkNN; Indoor Positioning; Kalman Filter; KNN","Advanced traffic management systems; Bluetooth; Indoor positioning systems; Kalman filters; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Wi-Fi; Bluetooth low energies (BTLE); Emergency evacuation; Filter applications; FkNN; Fuzzy k nearest neighbor (FKNN); Indoor positioning; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Traffic management; Global positioning system",,,,"Binus University","This research is partially funded by Bina Nusantara University through Hibah Terapan Universitas Bina Nusantara 2018.",,"Corbacho Salas, A., Indoor positioning system based on bluetooth low energy (2014) Universitat Polit{e}cnica de Catalunya; Kriz, P., Maly, F., Kozel, T., Improving indoor localization using bluetooth low energy beacons (2016) Mob.

The secret message could not be revealed unless the recipients exchange and collect shares to reconstruct the actual message. Even though the attacker obtain shares shadow during the share exchange, it would be impossible for the attacker to understand the correct share. There are few algorithms have been developed for secret sharing, e.g. secret splitting, Asmuth-Bloom secret sharing protocol, visual cryptography, etc. There is an unanswered question in this research about which method provides best level of security and efficiency in securing message. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of three methods, i.e. secret splitting, secret sharing, and recursive threshold visual cryptography for handwritten image security in terms of execution time and mean squared error (MSE) simulation. Simulation results show the secret splitting algorithm produces the shortest time of execution. On the other hand, the MSE simulation result that the three methods can reconstruct the original image very well. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Secret sharing; Splitting; Visual cryptography",,,,,,,,"Pakshwar, R., Trivedi, V.K., Richhariya, V., A Survey on Different Image Encryption and Decryption Techniques (2013) Int J Comput Sci Inf Technol, 4 (1), pp. 113-116; Sharma, A., Srivastava, D.K., A Comprehensive View on Encryption Techniques of Visual Cryptography (2014) Int J Recent Res Rev, 7 (2); Deng, H., Song, X., Chaos-Based Image Encryption Algorithm Using Decomposition (2014) Indones J Electr Eng Comput Sci, 12 (1), pp. 575-583; Yong-Jun, G., Li-Zheng, G., Ming-Hui, Z., Improved Multi-secret Sharing Scheme Based on One-Way Function (2014) Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (IJEECS), 12 (6), pp. 4463-4467; Anbarasi, L.J., Mala, G.S.A., Prassana, D.R.L., Visual Secret Sharing of Color Image Using Extended Asmuth Bloom Technique (2015) Computational Intelligence in Data Mining-, 3, pp. 555-562. , Springer; Yan, X., Lu, Y., Liu, L., Wan, S., Ding, W., Liu, H., Chinese Remainder Theorem-Based Secret Image Sharing for (k, n) Threshold (2017) International Conference on Cloud Computing and Security, pp. 433-440; Farras, O., Padró, C., Xing, C., Yang, A., Natural generalizations of threshold secret sharing (2014) IEEE Trans Inf Theory, 60 (3), pp. 652-664; Kumar, S., Sharma, R.K., Recursive information hiding of secrets by random grids (2013) Cryptologia, 37 (2), pp. 154-161; Parakh, A., Kak, S., Internet voting protocol based on improved implicit security (2010) Cryptologia, 34 (3), pp. 258-268; Hwang, S.J., Sung, Y.H., Chi, J.F., Deniable authentication protocols with confidentiality and anonymous fair protections (2013) Advances in Intelligent Systems and Applications, 2, pp. 41-51. , Springer; Husain, A.K., Rahman, A.A.R.A., A New Scheme for Pseudo Random Numbers Generator Based on Secret Splitting (2015) Int J Soft Comput Eng (IJSCE), pp. 2231-2307; Muhammad, Y.I., Kaiiali, M., Habbal, A., Wazan, A.S., Sani Ilyasu, A., A secure data outsourcing scheme based on Asmuth-Bloom secret sharing (2016) Enterp Inf Syst, 10 (9), pp. 1001-1023; Harn, L., Fuyou, M., Chang, C.-C., Verifiable secret sharing based on the Chinese remainder theorem (2014) Secur Commun Networks, 7 (6), pp. 950-957; Rathore, A.K., Jain, A., A Review on Various Implemented Techniques for Visual Cryptography (2016) Int J Comput Appl, 155 (5); Yan, X., Wang, S., Niu, X., Yang, C.-N., Generalized random grids-based threshold visual cryptography with meaningful shares (2015) Signal Processing, 109, pp. 317-333; Lecun, Y., MNIST handwritten digit database, Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes and Chris Burges, , http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, [Internet].

The company often asks the employees to do some assignments outside the office area, either inside or outside of their home country. A portable virtual private network (VPN) is a device that enables the employees to perform remote access connection to internal computer resources via internet. Therefore, the employee can still work on their assignments in company server while doing business travelling. In this paper, the secure and low power portable VPN prototype is being proposed. The prototype of the VPN portable gateway device is built using OpenVPN-R core applications that are modified from OpenVPN version 2.3.10 with OpenSSL version 1.0.2h. It is implemented into a single board computer (SBC) Raspberry Pi 3 Model B +. The modification performed in this system is the inclusion of Rabbit stream cipher algorithm to OpenSSL as one of the alternative options of TLS ciphersuites on OpenVPN. The prototype portable VPN gateway device generated from this research has Rabbit ciphersuites, platform independent, and has additional features inbuilt firewall. The simulation results show that the proposed prototype can perform secure data transfer. On the other hand the proposed Rabbit stream cipher algorithm shows better performance than other algorithm in terms of data transfer rate, CPU utilization, and memory usage which leads to smaller power consumption. © 2018 The Authors.

The traditional home security system, i.e. closed circuit television (CCTV) can only capture and record the video without able to give warning feedback if there is any suspicious object. Therefore, an additional object detection and warning method is required if there is an intruder. The proposed design is implemented using Raspberry Pi 3 and Arduino, which are connected by USB cable. The PIR sensor is installed on the Arduino and the webcam is mounted on Raspberry Pi 3. The Raspberry Pi 3 is used to process inputs from received sensors and process images for human detection. The PIR sensor detects the movement around the sensor to activate the webcam to capture a picture. Then, the object recognition is performed using histogram of gradient (HoG) and support vector machine (SVM) to detect the suspicious object. If the suspicious object is detected, then alarm is activated to warn the house owner about the existence of intruder. The evaluation results show that it takes in average 2 seconds for proposed system to detect the intruder. It also shows that the system can successfully detects the intruder with accuracy of 89%. © 2018 The Authors.

The reason is because company wants to reduce investment and maintenance cost by investing on single integrated network rather than traditional separated telecommunication, broadcasting and internet network. In this research, we use top down network design approach to create converged network design that tailored to fulfill the requirement from business and technical aspects. It is started by analyzing design requirement, perform logical and physical design, and perform design testing. Both data and voice traffic should be working well in converged network. In order to optimize the network design, the quality of service (QoS) will be considered. It will be used to accomodate various kind of traffic in this network. Simulation and experiment results show that the proposed network design can satisfy required QoS of converged service network. The proposed network design also performs better availability compared to the existing network design. © 2018 The Authors.

During sleep, people can stop breathing for a moment that causes the body lack of oxygen that lasts for several seconds to minutes even until the range of hours. If it happens for a long period, it can result in more serious diseases, e.g. high blood pressure, heart failure, stroke, diabetes, etc. Sleep apnea can be prevented by identifying the indication of sleep apnea itself from ECG, EEG, or other signals to perform early prevention. The purpose of this study is to build a classification model to identify sleep disorders from the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features that can be obtained with Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. In this study, HRV features were processed using several classification methods, i.e. ANN, KNN, N-Bayes and SVM linear Methods. The classification is performed using subject-specific scheme and subject-independent scheme. The simulation results show that the SVM method achieves higher accuracy other than three other methods in identifying sleep apnea. While, time domain features shows the most dominant performance among the HRV features. © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Sleep disorder may increase the risk of developing chronic physical and mental illnesses such as heart failure, coronary heart disease, depression, and bipolar disorder. In addition, sleep disorder also decreases work productivity and increases the risk of traffic accidents. The problem of sleep disorder is usually associated with the irregularity in sleep cycles. People need to get the right proportion of every stages and sufficient number of cycles to obtain a quality sleep. The aim of this study is to examine distinctive features related to sleep stages (wake, light sleep, deep sleep) from heart rate variability (HRV), and evaluate their usefulness to classify sleep stages. We utilize support vector machine (SVM) to classify the sleep stages classification and compare the result with conventional methods. We also utilize particle swarm optimization (PSO) for feature selection. The simulation results show that our proposed sleep classification with SVM and PSO can improve the accuracy of sleep stage classification. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Cardiology; Diseases; Heart; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machines; Bipolar disorder; Conventional methods; Coronary heart disease; Heart rate variability; Number of cycles; Sleep disorders; Sleep stages classifications; Work productivity; Sleep research",,,,,,,"Moorcroft, W.H., Belcher, P., (2003) Understanding Sleep and Dreaming, , Springer; Beecroft, J.M., Ward, M., Younes, M., Crombach, S., Smith, O., Hanly, P.J., Sleep monitoring in the intensive care unit: Comparison of nurse assessment, actigraphy and polysomnography (2008) Intensive Care Med., 34 (11), p. 20762083; Surantha, N., Kusuma, G.P., Isa, S.M., Internet of things for sleep quality monitoring system: A survey (2016) Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems (KICSS), 2016 11th International Conference on, p. 16; Werteni, H., Yacoub, S., Ellouze, N., An automatic sleep-wake classifier using ECG signals (2014) Int.

The proposed generated testbench is written in SystemVerilog to represent the functions and to reduce the code size compared to traditional Verilog testbench.

In the large-scale industrial network composed of multiple access points (APs), a delay time during roaming from one AP to another AP causes a discontinuation of the control of the iRBs. This roaming delay is usually induced by two processes; 1) scanning for a new AP and 2) authentication at the new AP. In order to avoid roaming delay, we propose a novel access scheme using pre-registration and time-synchronization. In this scheme, all APs operate in same channel with time-synchronization, and each iRBs are pre-registered to every AP before control. The analysis results show that the proposed scheme realizes zero delay, zero communication cost and low storage requirements for roaming. © 2016 IEEE.","Deterministic transmission; FA communication; Fast roaming; Industrial WLAN; pre-authentication; Wireless communication","Authentication; Factory automation; Industrial robots; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless telecommunication systems; Fast roaming; Industrial networks; Industrial wireless; Industrial WLAN; Multiple access points; Pre-authentication; Time synchronization; Wireless communications; Local area networks",,,,,,,"Willig, A., Recent and emerging topics in wireless industrial communications: A selection (2008) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, pp. 102-124. , May; Lo Bello, L., Mirabella, O., Communication techniques and architectures for Bluetooth networks in industrial scenarios (2005) IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA), pp. 52-61. , Sept.

The SFO can cause an intersymbol interference and an intercarrier interference that may degrade the performance of an OFDM system and result in high bit error rate. Since the value of SFO is usually very low (part per million scale), the SFO estimation is very susceptible to a noise. In this paper, we propose the estimation method that can minimize the influence of the noise in SFO estimation and also minimize the computational complexity. The performance of the proposed method has been verified with computer simulation. The computer simulation results show that the proposed sampling frequency offset estimation is more efficient in computational complexity compared to the conventional method to achieve the similar performance. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Computationally efficient; Conventional methods; Digital terrestrial television; High bit error rates; Intercarrier interference; Sampling frequencies; Sampling frequency offset; Transmitter and receiver; Computational complexity; Computer simulation; Digital television; Frequency allocation; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Signal encoding; Television systems; Estimation",,,,,,,"Chen, H.S., Novel sampling clock offset estimation for DVB-T OFDM (2003) IEEE VTC 2003-Fall, 4, pp. 2272-2276. , Oct; (2009) Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Framing Structure, Channel Coding, and Codulation for Digital Terrestrial Television, , ETSI EN 300 744 V1.6.1, Jan; Morelli, M., Moretti, M., Fine carrier and sampling frequency synchronization in OFDM systems (2010) IEEE Trans.

In order to estimate symbol timing, we employ correlation based synchronization in time domain by exploiting periodical pattern, that is introduced by Cyclic Prefix of ISDB-T OFDM frame structure. This periodical pattern induces higher correlation result in the beginning of each symbol, which gives us the information about the start of symbol. To increase the performance of system in Multipath Fading environment, we propose DFT window shift method. The correlation method just produces rough estimation of the start of symbol. The estimation result still cannot avoid Inter Symbol Interference. In order to avoid interference, we proposed DFT window shift. Simulation results shows that the proposed synchronizer can improve the performance of system in multipath fading channel.

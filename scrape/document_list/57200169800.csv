In this research, we propose sentence-level SLR using deep learning method by combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-RNN). Specifically, 3D CNN is implemented to extract features from each video frame and bidirectional-RNN is implemented to extract the unique features from the video frame's sequential behavior, which later generate a possible sentence. There are two key takeaways from this paper. The first is our proposed dataset of Indonesian Sign Language (SIBI) which is comprised of 30 sentences in SIBI. The second is our novel approach of using deep learning and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function in sentence-level SLR. The result shows that the hyperparameter used, in this case Hyperparameter 1, achieves the best result. Also, this research found that deeper network does not necessarily guarantee good results. A bigger number of dataset also affects the performance of the system. © 2018 IEEE.","CNN; CTC loss; deep learning; RNN; SIBI; sign language recognition","Bismuth compounds; Convolution; Deep learning;

Sign Language Recognition (SLR) system, which is required to recognize sign languages, has been widely studied for years. The studies are based on various input sensors, gesture segmentation, extraction of features and classification methods. This paper aims to analyze and compare the methods employed in the SLR systems, classifications methods that have been used, and suggests the most promising method for future research. Due to recent advancement in classification methods, many of the recent proposed works mainly contribute on the classification methods, such as hybrid method and Deep Learning. This paper focuses on the classification methods used in prior Sign Language Recognition system. Based on our review, HMM-based approaches have been explored extensively in prior research, including its modifications. Deep Learning such as Convolutional Neural Network is popular in the past five years. Hybrid CNN-HMM and fully Deep Learning approaches have shown promising results and offer opportunities for further exploration. However, overfitting and high computational requirements still hinder their adoption. We believe the future direction of the research is toward developing a simpler network that can achieve high performance and requires low computational load, which embeds the feature learner into the classifier in multi-layered neural network fashion. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Classification methods; Hidden Markov model; Neural networks; Sign language recognition",,,,,,"This research was supported by Research Grant No. 039A/VR.RTT/VI/2017 from Ministry of Research Technology and Higher Education of Republic of Indonesia.","Adithya, V., Vinod, P.R., Gopalakrishnan, U., Artificial neural network based method for Indian sign language recognition (2013) 2013 IEEE Conference on Information & Communication Technologies (ICT), pp. 1080-1085. , Thuckalay, Tamil Nadu, India; Ahuja, M.K., Singh, A., A Survey of Hand Gesture Recognition (2015) International Journal, 3 (5), pp. 266-271; Apoorva Ranjini, S.S., Chaitra, M., Deepika, V., Patil, J.M., Sign Language Recognition System (2014) International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication, 2 (4), pp. 947-953; Assael, Y.M., Shillingford, B., Whiteson, S., de Freitas, N., (2016) Lipnet: Sentence-Level Lipreading.

Unfortunately, every research has its own limitations and are still unable to be used commercially. Some of the researches have known to be successful for recognizing sign language, but require an expensive cost to be commercialized. Nowadays, researchers have gotten more attention for developing Sign Language Recognition that can be used commercially. Researchers do their researches in various ways. It starts from the data acquisition methods. The data acquisition method varies because of the cost needed for a good device, but cheap method is needed for the Sign Language Recognition System to be commercialized. The methods used in developing Sign Language Recognition are also varied between researchers. Each method has its own strength compare to other methods and researchers are still using different methods in developing their own Sign Language Recognition. Each method also has its own limitations compared to other methods. The aim of this paper is to review the sign language recognition approaches and find the best method that has been used by researchers. Hence other researchers can get more information about the methods used and could develop better Sign Language Application Systems in the future. © 2017 The Authors.

In geographical unit analysis, it refers to the Global Competition, that affecting the Regional Competition and eventually Country including Indonesia. The mentioned theoretical aspects are further equipped with the empirical aspects in Steel Industry, as Industry unit analysis. The mentioned Industry in this paper explores the usage of Analytical Network Process (ANP) as relates to Distributor Selection. The analysis in this paper provides also the analysis using ARENA Simulation Software. Simultaneously the ANP is deemed as the methodology in this paper, using questionnaires. The objectives of this paper is to have balances among theoretical aspects and empirical aspects. Precisely, the balances refer to theoretical aspects of Industrial Engineering, Supply Chain Management using ANP and ARENA, toward the empirical aspects of Steel Industry in determining Distribution Selection. Subsequently the mentioned balances refer to the decision making through ANP through some available options and prioritized criteria. The mentioned results are related to the objectives of this paper to obtain the best distributor, resulted from 46.64 % of selected distributor among existed distributors. The data used for the calculation of ANP was obtained from the average row, average weight sum, sum average weight, consistency ratio, consistency index, the random indices, lambda vector consistency, consistency vector. © Research India Publications.","Analytical network process; Industrial engineering; Iron rods; Steel industry; Supply chain",,,,,,"Abugabah, A., Sanzogni, L., Poropat, A., (2010) The Impact of Information Systems on User Performance: A Critical Review and Theoretical Model, 1, pp. 1-13; Branch, A.E., (2009) Global Supply Chain Management and International Logistics, , New York.

Websites that provides such information often misleads since the information changes from time to time. This paper discusses the development of an application to provide updated information about public transportation route guide that can be accessed through a website. The application has worked successfully in searching routes, searching places, adding routes, adding places, editing routes, and editing places for the city of Jakarta, Indonesia. Based on the survey done by author, 73% respondents are willing to use the site and 80% respondents are willing to contribute information to the site. The test showed that 50% of the respondents can use the application's function in the first try without any difficulty. The application has managed to provide useful functions for the target users therefore attracted enough attention to build a growing and informative e-society. © 2010 IEEE.","Google map geocoding; Public transportation; Route guide","E-society; Geo coding; Google maps; Indonesia; Jakarta; Public transportation; Developing countries; Surveys; World Wide Web; Transportation routes",,,,,"Zulfiki, M., Hino, Y., Principal issues to improve the Urban transport problems in Jakarta (2006) Mem.

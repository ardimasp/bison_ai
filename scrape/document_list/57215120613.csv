Selected values are generally performed by trial and error. This study evaluates performance of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and two optimizers combined with changes in 6 learning rate values. Researched optimizers are Adaptive Moment Estimation and RMS Prop in wildlife animal classification domain. Other hyperparameter values are set same. The architectures are implemented on DenseNet 121, ResNet 50 and AlexNet. This study recommends best value of learning rate for training process which will be conducted with conditions similar to this study and provide other insights during study. The images in this study used wild animals with various positions from front side, back side and some part of bodies that describe real condition. In contradiction to other studies which generally use images in the hundreds of thousands to millions, the number of images used is 47, 841 taken from the Serengeti Season 1 Snapshot with imbalance conditions. Obtained result with the highest recall reached 79%. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

OLTP data suggested for the data warehouse is the existing employment type based transactions, which will be used to analyze employment and unemployment rate in each region. The proposed method to design the data warehouse is using 9-steps from Kimball. The selected process for the data warehouse is calculating number of employment type, with dimensions of region, education type, sex and employment type.

However, different type of ownership will have different level of conflict. Family ownership is deemed to be more affected by agency problem type II. Using the data of Kompas 100 listed firms in Indonesia, this study aims to comprehend the effect of a family ownership and its level of accounting conservatism. The study also analyses the correlation between managerial ownership toward the level of accounting conservatism. Findings show that family business significantly affects the level of accounting conservatism. In contrast, this study cannot find any effect on managerial ownership on the degree of accounting conservatism.","Accounting conservatism; Agency problem type I; Agency problem type II; Family business; Indonesia listed firms; Managerial ownership",,,,,,"Ahmed, A.S., Duellman, S., Accounting conservatism and board of director characteristics: An empirical analysis (2007) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 43 (2), pp. 411-437; Ali, A., Chen, T.Y., Radhakrishnan, S., Corporate disclosures by family firms (2007) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 44 (1), pp. 238-286; Anderson, R.C., Reeb, D.M., Foundingfamily ownership and firm performance: Evidence from the S&P 500 (2003) Journal of Finance, 58, pp. 1301-1328; Ball, R., Robin, A., Sadka, G., Is financial reporting shaped by equity markets or by debt markets?

Many of them are now big public firms that contribute significantly to the Indonesian economy. As public firms, their reports are used by investors to value their traded shares. A firm’s reported earnings are important information for investors. This study aims to examine the earnings quality of Indonesian listed family businesses and compare this information with their counterparts. Using earnings persistence and predictability as proxies for earnings quality, this study finds that the earnings of Indonesia family businesses are less persistent than their counterpart’s earnings, due to type II agency problem and business diversification. However, there is no difference found in earnings predictability of both businesses. Thus, this study concludes that Indonesian family businesses have poor earnings quality compared to their counterparts. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

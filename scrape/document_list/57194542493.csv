One of the main issues faced by those tourists is that they can not make simple queries to search engines about, for example, which sites or places to visit optimally if we only have one day or two-day visit? Search engines are better and better in replying users' queries with relevant answers. However, search engines are not always able to respond queries suited to users' characteristics such as their styles, personalities, knowledge backgrounds, etc. Also, search engines are not as flexible as chatbots in enabling dialogical-communication-queries. This case study aims to respond aformentioned issue by applying hierarchical cluster analysis on a set of tourism sites around Malang city, Malang regency, and Batu city based on AGNES (Agglomerative Nesting) algorithm. The result, then, is fed into chatbot's knowledge base. This chatbot will assist tourists to get information on which possible sites they have to visit optimally if they are under limited vacancy-Time constraints. © 2018 IEEE.","AGNES algorithm; chatbot; tourism sites","Cluster analysis; Hierarchical systems; Information management; Knowledge based systems; Search engines; Chatbot; Chatbots; Hierarchical cluster analysis; Knowledge base; Time constraints; tourism sites; Clustering algorithms",,,,,"Brooke, S., A travel industry revolution: The chatbots (2017) Chatbots Journal, , https://chatbotsjournal.com/a-Travelindustry-revolution-The-chatbots-1a2468baf78c, [Accessed: 30-Mar-2018]; Han, J., Kamber, M., Pei, J., (2012) Data Mining-Concepts and Techniques 3ed-Jiawei Han, Micheline Kamber Elsevier 2006 772s; Zhao, Y., Karypis, G., Evaluation of hierarchical clustering algorithms for document datasets (2002) Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management-CIKM 02, p. 515; Davidson, I., Ravi, S.S., Agglomerative hierarchical clustering with constraints: Theory and empirical resutls (2005) 9th Eur.

Unstructured content such as images, audio, video, PDF, Word documents and other types are becoming more and more common in various fields. Database is an area that has found extensive use of images and text in past few years. This paper present a model for storing unstructured data such as document in database using BasicFile and SecureFile method within Oracle 12c Database. The result, SecureFiles method is more efficient in using storage and faster then BasicFiles method. © 2016 IEEE.","BasicFiles; Oracle; SecureFiles; Unstructured","Digital storage; Information management; BasicFiles; Comparative studies; Critical business; Oracle; Oracle database; SecureFiles; Unstructured; Unstructured data; Database systems",,,,,"Guo, C., Design and implementation of a multimedia database application system (2013) J.

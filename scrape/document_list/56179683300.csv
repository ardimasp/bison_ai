The system itself is a subsystem of a home security system. The subsystem is one of the essential parts of a home security system that protects its inhabitants, the house itself and the environment around it. It is based on technology that is related to Internet of Things (IOT). The IOT technology being utilized depends on the data communication infrastructure that is running in a house. The infrastructure is built and based on Lora (long Range) technology and in particular Lorawan. The Infrastructure complies with the demand that it is useful and fulfils the requirements of IOT. Lorawan is quite recent but technically comply with the demands for IOT. This research focused on gas leakage detection using a detector. Gas leakage that needs immediate detection is generally used for home use such as LPG. LPG is generally used in house kitchens or sometimes bath rooms. The developed module is for detection and issuance of warning the existence of LPG in its environment. The data for issuance of warning is communicated to a system called Premises Controller. The protection of a house against gas leakage is essential due to its sensitivity to fire sparks. Fire sparks can trigger fire and often explosion. A sensor's sensitivity and the time of early warning determine the effectiveness of mitigating efforts. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Gas Sensor; Internet of Things; Lorawan; Sensor Location","Chemical sensors; Fire protection; Houses; Liquefied petroleum gas; Security systems; Data-communication; Early warning; Gas leakages; Home security systems; Infra-structure; Internet of Things (IOT); Lorawan; Sensor location; Internet of things",,,,,"Robles, R.J., Kim, T.H., Cook, D., Das, S., A review on security in smart home development (2010) International Journal of Advanced Science and Technology, 15; Rajitha, S., Swapna, T., Security alert system using GSM for gas leakage (2012) International Journal of VLSI and Embedded Systems-IJVES, 3, pp. 173-175; Fraiwan, L., Lweesy, K., Bani-Salma, A., Mani, N., A wireless home safety gas leakage detection system (2011) Proceedings IEEE 1st Middle East Conference on Biomedical Engineering (MECBME), pp. 11-14; Murvay, P.S., Silea, I., A survey on gas leak detection and localization techniques (2012) Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries, 25 (6), pp. 966-973; Technical Data MQ-2 Gas Sensor, , https://www.mouser.com/ds/2/321/605-00008-MQ-2-Datasheet-370464.pdf, Hanwei Electronics (nd); MQ-2 Semiconductor Sensor for Combustible Gas, , https://www.pololu.com/file/0J309/MQ2.pdf, Polulu (nd); Jaladi, A.R., Khithani, K., Pawar, P., Malvi, K., Sahoo, G., Environmental monitoring using wireless sensor networks (WSN) based on IOT (2017) Int.

IOT applications for Home Security and Smart Home applications are of interest. Both applications are sensor rich and those sensors face the problem of transmitting data related to their task. Hence, this research concern providing solution of data transmission infrastructure within the house and ultimately to a centralized control and monitoring site. Infrastructure is important as each sensor has its specific task and generally made by different vendors. The infrastructure selection methods is based on the logic that wireless infrastructure is preferred to avoid costly installation and aesthetics reasons. Energy consumption for green compliance is another consideration. Sensors that are IOT ready are low power for green compliance. IOT ready sensors have intelligence embedded to it and could receive and transmit data according to its needs. In this research Lorawan is selected as the solution of providing the wireless infrastructure within a house due to its readiness for IOT and fulfil other requirements as well. The behaviour of Lorawan in terms of data transmission reliability and coverage is measured. Experiments are conducted for determining transmission coverage. The result shows Lorawan is suitable for implementing in house wireless infrastructure. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In this research the understanding of eco friendly is minimum power consumption. The devices that are selected have operationally low power consumption and normally have no power consumption as they are hibernating during idle state. To have the reliability a router of a router that has internal load balancing feature will provide the improvement of previous research on multi 3G services for broadband lines. Previous studies emphasized on accessing and downloading information files from Public Cloud residing Web Servers. The demand is not only for speed but high reliability of access as well. High reliability will mean mitigating both direct and indirect high cost due to repeated attempts of uploading and downloading the large files. Nomadic and mobile computer users need viable solution. Following solution for downloading information has been proposed and tested. The solution is promising. The result is now extended to providing reliable access line by means of redundancy and automatic reconfiguration for uploading and downloading large information files to a Web Server in the Cloud. The technique is taking advantage of internal load balancing feature to provision a redundant line acting as a backup line. A router that has the ability to provide load balancing to several WAN lines is chosen. The WAN lines are constructed using multiple 3G lines.

Mobility is increasingly demanded along with broadband. Certain to locations do not have the necessary infrastructure for broadband. Users that are residing in fixed locations will be able to access broadband service. They could access high-speed access line and enjoy for broadband services offered by service providers. The operators provide both conventional copper cables and fiber optic cables as access lines. Sometimes it is not possible for users that are nomadic or mobile to obtain broadband access line. Quite often small and medium-sized companies need to have an alternative solution to access broadband lines that are economic and technically simple. In the mean time, cellular service providers offer 3G Internet services with nationwide coverage to access the Internet. 3G service has reasonably high transmission speed. We had performed a similar research but changes in the platform and algorithm in the router challenged us to ensure sustainability of the concept. This research still develops an application that uses multi 3G services to provide broadband access. The solution that is being developed should sustain its economic nature and simplicity. Using available multiple 3G connections, a user can access large files of information through virtual high speed channel anytime and any where. A technique of paralleling multiple lower speed channels to obtain a virtual high-speed channel is called inverse multiplexing. To simplify the technique a router that has the ability to provide load balancing to several WAN lines is chosen. The inverse multiplexing concept through a number of channels with 3G services can run well for downloading files from a Web Server as shown by laboratory experiments and field measurements. © 2016 IEEE.","3G; Inverse Multiplexing; Load balancing","Cables; Internet service providers; Multiplexing; Multiplexing equipment; Resource allocation; Speed; Technical presentations; Telecommunication lines; Web services; Alternative solutions; High transmission; High-speed access lines; High-speed channels; Information contents; Inverse multiplexing; Laboratory experiments; Small and medium-sized companies; Electronic document exchange",,,,,"Tanutama, L., Wijaya, R., Alexander, K., Wiratama, A., Indraswara, R., A novel broadband line construction using 3g service (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 19-26; Qiu, R.C., Zhu, W., Zhang, Y., Third-generation and beyond (3.5g) wireless networks and its Applications (2002) IEEE International Symposium.

If the location is static the needs can be addressed easily. There are high-speed transmission or broadband services offered by a large number of operators through both conventional and fiber optic cables. If the users are moving nomadically or are mobile, then obtaining large-capacity transmission systems is not simple. For some purposes, especially for small and medium-sized companies, they need to have alternative solutions that are economic and technically feasible. Cellular service providers offer 3G Internet services with wide coverage. This study develops an application using 3G services to provide broadband access that is economic and relatively simple. This solution uses multiple 3G connection to transmit information at high speed as if there is broadband channel capacity. Information on a Web Server can be downloaded by the parties concerned. The information retrieval can obtain the necessary capacity using multiple 3G connections. The technique of bundling multiple lower speed channels to obtain high-speed channel is called inverse multiplexing. In this research, the technique is simplified by using a router that has the ability to provide load balancing. This research was carried out by conducting laboratory experiments and field measurements. The experimental results show that the concept of inverse multiplexing through a number of channels with 3G services can run well for downloading files. © 2015 The Authors.

The system was designed to send and track data by which the stability, the level of system response, and the availability of the system were continually measured. The experiment result showed that the mean interval for updating data under HSDPA connection was better than EDGE. By using HSDPA, it was observed that the fastest interval recorded in the database was 1 second.

As Information Technology (IT) provides the infrastructure backbone for business activities, a corporate network connects the company to Internet and enables it to perform its activities globally. The corporate carries data packets generated by the users' while performing their business tasks. Traditionally, the infrastructure operations mainly maintain the data carrying capacity and network devices performance. The research provides a simple method of mapping the business activity reflected by the network data. Modified Attribute Oriented Induction (AOI) approach mines the network data for mapping corporate users' activities. A frequency count was taken for each attributes of interest to show what happened in the network. The collected data were samples taken within a certain sampling period. based on the frequency count, we define four novel corporate network characteristics: Network Infrastructure characteristics, User Characteristics, Accessibility Characteristics, and Activity Characteristics.

As Information Technology infrastructure backbone for business activities, corporate network connects the company to Internet and enables its activities globally. It carries data packets generated by the activities of the users performing their business tasks. Traditionally, infrastructure operations mainly maintain data carrying capacity and network devices performance. It would be advantageous if a company knows what activities are running in its network. The research provides a simple method of mapping the business activity reflected by the network data. To map corporate users' activities, a slightly modified Attribute Oriented Induction (AOI) approach to mine the network data was applied. The frequency of each protocol invoked were counted to show what the user intended to do. The collected data was samples taken within a certain sampling period. Samples were taken due to the enormous data packets generated. Protocols of interest are only Internet related while intranet protocols are ignored. It can be concluded that the method could provide the management a general overview of the usage of its infrastructure and lead to efficient, effective and secure ICT infrastructure. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,"Applegate, L.M., Austin, R.D., Soule, D.L., (2009) Corporate Information Strategy and Management, , Mc.Graw-Hill; Berson, Smith, Thearling, (2000) Building DM Applications for CRM, , http://www.ii.edu.mk/predmeti/Inteligentni%20sistemi/Predavanja/ dm%20techniques.pdf, McGraw-Hill; Fayyad, U.M., Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Smyth, G.P., (1996) AI Magazine, 17, p. 3; Gangopadhyay, B., Arsenio, A., Antunes, C., Data engineering and management (2012) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 101-108. , Springer Berlin / Heidelberg; Goth, G., (2010) Comm.Of the ACM, 53, p. 11; Han, J., Kamber, M., (2001) Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, , Morgan Kaufman; Li, S.T., Shue, L.Y., Lee, S.F., (2006) Expert Systems with Applications, 30, pp. 621-632; Li, S.T., Shue, L.Y., Lee, S.F., (2008) Expert Systems with Applications, 35, pp. 739-754; Martín-Bautista, M.J., Vila, M., Escobar-Jeria, V.H., (2008) Proceedings of the IADIS, pp. 73-76; Weiss D.

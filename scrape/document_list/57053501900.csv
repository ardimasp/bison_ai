The purpose of this current study is to evaluate the user experience of an application called Teksologi: Gamification interactive typing for visually impaired children in Indonesia. User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) were applied to measure several aspects include attractiveness, dependability, efficiency, perspicuity, novelty, and stimulation. A total of 22 visually impaired participants had been involved for this study. Besides, Alpha Cronbach test and directly check the means of each items inside the scales to draw the conclusions were conducted to examine the consistency of each aspect, then comparison to UEQ benchmark also applied. The result show that all the quality aspect is positive. At the same time, stimulation had the highest value, but perspicuity had the smallest value that enhancement will be needed to make user feel easy to get familiar with the application, easy to learn to use the application. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

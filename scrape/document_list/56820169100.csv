MRI images of brain tumors have quite high complexity both from variable size and structure, low contrast, bad boundaries, and low homogeneity. In some cases noise appears like blur, miss focus, and miss alignment of images. Manually image segmentation requires high accuracy, since each pixel contains important information. In addition, it will potentially lead to different interpretations of each expert. The tools that are used by experts to read MRI images of the brain nowadays, can present images into several regions namely sagittal, coronal, and cross sectional. The division into these three regions is actually quite helpful during the diagnosis process, since the doctor can see the brain tissue in the three regions, but the display cannot lead to an object that is found slightly different from particular area or focus on one particular object or area that shows a difference or abnormality. The expected outcome of this initial research is an architecture design for segmenting MRI images of brain tumors by involving two algorithms, MDWT and CNN. Combination both of MDWT and CNN provides new approaches in medical images analysis including brain image tumor segmentation. Researchers use literature study and laboratory experiment as the research methods.

However, the local governments can only use the plans from the central government. The negative effects of this, among others, are improper land use allocation, lack of facilities, and crimes that are difficult to handle. This study proposes a geographic information system (GIS)-based method to analyze the proper central business district in Karawang, a small district in Java, Indonesia. Multi-criteria analysis of factors affecting the candidate locations was used through a weighted sum method in a model. The spatial data were retrieved and analyzed using a GIS tool to classify region into urban, peri-urban, and rural. Some central business locations have been found after reclassification which is located near the toll gates. Two locations in the north of Karawang were classified have the potential to become the new central business locations. © 2020 IEEE.","Extended Urbanization; Peri-Urban; Reclassification; Spatial Data Analysis; Weighted Sum Method","Land use; Location; Candidate locations; Central business districts; Central government; Land use allocation; Local government; Multi Criteria Analysis; Spatial data; Weighted sum method; Geographic information systems",,,,,,"Steiner, F., (2008) The Living Landscape-An Ecological Approach to Landscape Planning-Second Edition, , Washington DC: ISLAND PRESS; Williams, K., Burton, E., Jenks, M., (2000) Achieving Sustainable Urban Form.pdf, , E & FN Spon, New York; (2015) Habitat III Issue Papers-Public Space, , UN United Nation Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development; Mardiansjah, F.H., Extended urbanization in smaller-sized cities and small town development in Java: The case of the Tegal Region (2020) Iop Conf.

The purpose of this research is to recognize fraudulent transactions on debit cards with development of the Enhanced Auxiliary Classifier-Generative Adversarial Network (EAC-GAN) model which is a development of Auxiliary Classifier-Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN) model. EAC-GAN uses AC-GAN, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and tuning parameter to recognize fraud transactions in debit cards and increase F1-Score. SMOTE is used to overcome imbalanced data in debit card transactions dataset. Then PCA is required to reduce dimension of the dataset and to know which factors are influential in explaining the phenomenon in the dataset while maintaining characteristics of the data. Parameter tuning is useful to achieve the best F1-Score in training and testing the EAC-GAN model. This research also explores the study of AC-GAN and Convolutional Neural Network 2 Dimension (CNN2D) performance. The result of this research describes that EAC-GAN model beats CNN2D done in the previous research. F1-Score for EAC-GAN is 74% and F1-Score generated by the CNN2D model is 35%. Conclusion from this research is that EAC-GAN model works better in fraud transaction in debit cards surpassing CNN2D model. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Detection of retinopathy can be by analyzing the retinal image, using a deep learning approach, but the problem that is often faced is unbalanced data. In this study, a convolutional neural network architec- ture is proposed for the classification of retinopathy using the MESSIDOR database that has been labeled, by duplicating and augmentation of sample images in classes with low numbers of samples using a data generator to overcome the problem of unbalanced data. The experimental results show that the validation and testing accuracy performance on the model with two output classes are 100%, and 87.50%, while on the model with four output classes are 99.38%, and 76.47%.

Using the Global Financial Development Database-GFDD, we estimate a regression of net interest margins to a set of variables specifically proxies for competition, capacity and some controlling variables. Panel data econometric techniques employed are fixed effect, random effect and pooled OLS. We find that intermediation cost is positively associated with capital adequacy, overhead cost, return on equity and ZSCORE. On the other hand, it is negatively associated with loan to deposit ratio, deposit to GDP and GDP per capita. Finally, our study has shown that income level and financial deepening have positive impact on intermediation efficiency. © 2020, Universita Putra Malaysia.","Bank intermediation cost; Capacity; Competition; Panel data econometrics",,,,,,,"Aaron, A., Nainggolan, Y.A., Trinugroho, I., Corporate failure prediction model in Indonesia: Revisiting the Z-scores, discriminant analysis, logistic regression and artificial neural network (2017) Journal for Global Business Advancement, 10 (2), pp. 187-209; Al-Harbi, A., The determinants of conventional banks profitability in developing and underdeveloped OIC countries (2019) Journal of Economics, Finance and Administrative Science, 24 (47), pp. 4-28; Allen, L., The determinants of bank interest margins: A note (1988) Journal of Financial and Quantitative analysis, 23 (2), pp. 231-235; Angbazo, L., Commercial bank net interest margins, default risk, interest-rate risk, and off-balance sheet banking (1997) Journal of Banking & Finance, 21 (1), pp. 55-87; Angori, G., Aristei, D., Gallo, M., Determinants of Banks' Net Interest Margin: Evidence from the Euro Area during the Crisis and Post-Crisis Period (2019) Sustainability, 11 (14), p. 3785; Ariss, R.T., On the implications of market power in banking: Evidence from developing countries (2010) Journal of banking & Finance, 34 (4), pp. 765-775; Athanasoglou, P.P., Brissimis, S.N., Delis, M.D., Bank-specific, industry-specific and macroeconomic determinants of bank profitability (2008) Journal of international financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 18 (2), pp. 121-136; Barth, J.R., Caprio, G., Levine, R., (2008) Rethinking bank regulation: Till angels govern, , Cambridge University Press; Beck, T., Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Levine, R., Bank concentration, competition, and crises: First results (2006) Journal of Banking & Finance, 30 (5), pp. 1581-1603; Berger, A.N., Udell, G.F., Some evidence on the empirical significance of credit rationing (1992) Journal of Political Economy, 100 (5), pp. 1047-1077; Berger, A.N., Udell, G.F., Small business credit availability and relationship lending: The importance of bank organisational structure (2002) The economic journal, 112 (477), pp. F32-F53; Berger, A.N., Molyneux, P., Wilson, J.O., (2014) The Oxford handbook of banking, , OUP Oxford; Berger, A.N., Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Levine, R., Haubrich, J.G., Bank concentration and competition: An evolution in the making (2004) Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, pp. 433-451; Boone, J., A new way to measure competition (2008) The Economic Journal, 118 (531), pp. 1245-1261; Boyd, J.H., De Nicolo, G., The theory of bank risk taking and competition revisited (2005) The Journal of finance, 60 (3), pp. 1329-1343; Bresnahan, T.F., The oligopoly solution concept is identified (1982) Economics Letters, 10 (1-2), pp. 87-92; Walsh, C.E., (2017) Monetary theory and policy, , MIT press; Čihák, M., Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Feyen, E., Levine, R., Benchmarking financial systems around the world (2012) World Bank policy research working paper, p. 6175; Degryse, H., Kim, M., Ongena, S., (2009) Microeconometrics of banking: Methods, applications, and results, , Oxford University Press, USA; Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Huizinga, H., Financial structure and bank profitability (2000) World Bank Policy Research Working Paper, p. 2430; Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Levine, R., (2004) Financial structure and economic growth: A cross-country comparison of banks, markets, and development, , MIT press; Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Laeven, L., Levine, R., Regulations, Market Structure, Institutions, and the Cost of Financial Intermediation (2004) Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 36 (3), pp. 593-622; Demirguc-Kunt, A., Martínez Pería, M.S., (2010) A framework for analyzing competition in the banking sector: An application to the case of Jordan, , The World Bank; Dietrich, A., Wanzenried, G., Determinants of bank profitability before and during the crisis: Evidence from Switzerland (2011) Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 21 (3), pp. 307-327; Eichenbaum, M.S., Hansen, L.P., Singleton, K.J., A time series analysis of representative agent models of consumption and leisure choice under uncertainty (1988) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 103 (1), p. 5178; Entrop, O., Memmel, C., Ruprecht, B., Wilkens, M., Determinants of bank interest margins: Impact of maturity transformation (2015) Journal of Banking & Finance, 54, pp. 1-19; Fischer, K.H., Pfeil, C., (2003) Regulation and competition in German banking: An assessment, , (No. 2003/19).

Distribution process carried out the process of acquisition, purchase, storage, distribution, transport, repackaging, re-labeling, documentation, and record-keeping practices. The problems that occur in the validation process of each distribution process in each party involved are not well registered and integrated with each other, so in the complex drug distribution environment, the monitoring process becomes a necessity every time more urgent and primary to reduce theft, prevent counterfeiting, and improve efficiency, synchronization, visibility, and safety. Providing good tracking of goods gives consumers greater interest in the consumption of goods that meet certain ecological and ethical standards and thus requires the quality of the goods consumed. In this thought, it aims to discuss the best blockchain models for the drug distribution process. This research is qualitative research. As a result, the model was introduced as a potential blockchain model and could be applied in pharmaceutical companies in Indonesia.

The growth of SMEs has made little contribution to Indonesia export value while their business orientation is ready to export in real data. The purpose of this study is to analyse the mediating effect of the Internationalisation process on knowledge management and export towards SMEs Export Performance. The research strategies used include the associative quantitative method where the data collection method consists of a survey distributed to 154 Export-Oriented SMEs respondents while data analysis technique incorporates path analysis using double regression method. The results show that the internationalisation process has a mediating effect on knowledge management and the dynamic capabilities that affect SMEs export performance. Knowledge management and dynamic capabilities have a direct impact on SMEs export performance. The value of mediating effect is lower than its direct effect, showing that the internationalisation process enhances the effect of knowledge management and dynamic capabilities towards SMEs export performance. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Dynamic capabilities; Export performance; Internationalisation process; Knowledge management; Mediating effect",,,,,,,"Management influences on export performance: A review of the empirical literature 1978-1988 (1989) International Marketing Review, 6 (4), pp. 7-26; Strategi produk untuk mengatasi hambatan ekspor UKM industry kerajinan Indonesia (2015) Jurnal Manajemen & Bisnis Sriwijaya, 13 (1), pp. 39-53; Knowledge management and the innovation performance in a high-tech SMEs industry (2011) International Small Business Journal, pp. 1-18; Internationalization of small-and medium-sized enterprises: A multi case study (2010) European Business Review, 22 (6), pp. 608-623; International new ventures: Rapid internationalization across different industry contexts' (2014) European Business Review, 26 (5), pp. 390-405. , https://doi.org/10.1108/EBR-05-2014-0040; Determinants and measures of export performance-comprehensive literature review (2014) Journal of Contemporary Economic and Business Issues, 1 (1), pp. 63-74; Export market-oriented behaviour and export performance: Quadratic and moderating effects under differing degrees of market dynamism and internationalization (2009) Journal of International Marketing, 17 (4), pp. 71-89; 29 Tantangan Internasionalisasi Ukm Di Indonesia Dalam Menghadapi Masyarakat Ekonomi (2015) Journal Kajian, 27 (9), pp. 129-144; Marketing strategy-performance relationship: An investigation of the empirical link in export market ventures (1994) Journal of Marketing, 58, pp. 1-21; The Determinants of Export Performance: A Review of the Literature 2006-2014 (2016) International Marketing Review, 33 (5), pp. 626-670; Information, knowledge and collaboration management in the internationalisation of SMEs: A systematic literature review (2016) International Journal of Information Management, 36 (4), pp. 557-569; The emergence, advance and future of international entrepreneurship research: An introduction to the special forum (2011) Journal of Business Venturing, 26 (6), pp. 625-631; Institutional theory and institutional change: Introduction to the special research forum (2002) The Academy of Management Journal, 45 (1), pp. 43-56; Viewpoint-Export Performance Measurement: Reflective Versus Formative I˙ndicators (1999) International Marketing Review, 16 (6), pp. 444-457; Knowledge management in SMEs: A literature review (2012) Journal of Knowledge Management, 16 (6), pp. 879-903; Dynamic capabilities and Knowledge Management: An integrative role for learning?

This conceptual framework includes problems in predicting student performance, the possibility of graduating on time, and recommends choosing subjects according to performance, and career interests, which are useful for assisting pedagogical interventions in future student development. The success in the development and implementation of the proposed IRS framework is inseparable from using data mining and machine learning techniques in predicting and providing recommendations. Data analysis consisted of clustering techniques, association rules, and classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN). These techniques are used to solve problems related to students and to provide appropriate recommendations. The result is an IRS conceptual framework for the college student that can be used as smart agents to provide student guidance and suggestions to support the process of education in higher education. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data mining; Nearest neighbor search; Recommender systems; Support vector machines; Clustering techniques; Conceptual frameworks; Higher education institutions; Intelligent recommender system; K nearest neighbours (k-NN); Machine learning techniques; Student development; Student performance; Students",,,,,,"Alharbi, Z., Cornford, J., Dolder, L., De La Iglesia, B., Using data mining techniques to predict students at risk of poor performance (2016) 2016 SAI Computing Conference (SAI) (IEEE), pp. 523-531; Higher Education Statistical 2017 (2017) Higher Education Statistical Year Book, pp. 1-194. , Ministry of Research Technology and Higher Education of Republic of Indonesia; Flasiński, M., (2016) Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, pp. 3-13; Lu, J., Wu, D., Mao, M., Wang, W., Zhang, G., Recommender system application developments: A survey (2015) Decis.

Reasons for educational institutions to use cloud computing as a means of learning include cloud service providers providing sizable hardware and software resources, so educational institutions do not have to pay a large amount of money to buy hardware and software as an investment. But as long as this online learning system runs there will definitely be risks, for example performance problems from internet network connections. This study aims to discuss this problem. Methodology/approach In this study, firstly identifying dangerous or harmless activities to the activities carried out in cloud computing, then determining the impact, aspects, likelihood and severity of risks, and finally determining the level of risk from these activities using a risk matrix. Finding- By using a risk register in the learning system, risk analysis and evaluation can show the Incident, Cause, impact, risk type, risk category, aspect, likelihood, severity, and risk level for each dangerous or non-hazardous activity.

Educational institutions that provide open networks and connected to many devices simultaneously become an exciting testing ground for cybercriminals. Anti-virus is often used as prevention by applying signature-based detection of specific tiles contained in the database. Unfortunately, because much new malware continues to grow, the detection of the database becomes inaccurate. Therefore, automatic detection has been carried out using Autoencoder hybridized with ANN and CNN approaches. It will be developed using Python programming language with computer specification of 16GB RAM and Processor i7-7500U. Samples used are malware dataset obtained from various types of repositories such as virussign.com, the Zoo, and certain libraries from researchers. The dimensions of samples will be reconstructed using Autoencoder to generate new values that will be used as input on ANN and CNN. This research also has been developed Principal Component Analysis as a comparison architecture. Those approaches provide outstanding results in detecting malware, scilicet PCA-ANN with an accuracy of 0.985, PCACNN with an accuracy of 0.963, Autoencoder -ANN with an accuracy of 0.994, and Autoencoder -CNN with an accuracy of 0.970. Therefore, those approaches can be used as reference in increasing the need for educational institutions to improve their security from malware by detecting tiles that will be sent or read by each user. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial;

Fall detection method is needed to minimized the problem when human fallen and smartphone can be used as the device to detect it. Usually people carry smartphone in any positions and can make fall detection method difficult to detect when fall occurs. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) combined with Sigmoid helps to answer the challenge to handle smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope data in many smartphone orientation position. LSTM method on this experiment can achieved 91.67% for the accuracy result.

Data from the satellite usually have lower accuracy than other expensive methods e.g. drone, aerial view, etc. However, the data from satellite have wide range area and sufficient enough for modeling a land use. The accuracy assessment, therefore, becomes a vital task to ensure the model from the satellite imagery meets the minimum requirement. Validating the classification result by comparing to the real location or by other higher resolution images is needed. The paper proposed additional validation by comparing the classification result by another result in different date through the cross-tabulation method. Two satellite imageries in the same year were processed before classification to get the land-use and land-cover classification. Comparing two land-use classified images gave the accuracy statistics using cross-tabulation. The kappa statistic and accuracy showed the classification performance of 0.7592 that similar to the sampling-based accuracy assessment (0.75390). Therefore, the proposed method was appropriate as the accuracy assessment. © 2019 IEEE.","cross-tabulation; kappa statistic; land-use classification; satellite imagery","Antennas; Land use; Satellite imagery; Accuracy measurements; Classification performance; Classification results; cross-tabulation; Higher resolution images; Kappa statistic; Land-use and land cover classifications; Landuse classifications; Image classification",,,,,,"Handayanto, R., Tripathi, N.K., Kim, S.M., Herlawati, H., Land use growth simulation and optimization for achieving a sustainable urban form (2018) TELKOMNIKA (Telecommunication Comput.

The data for this study were collected by recording many sample units from each of the following human activity categories: stand-fall, walk-fall, stand-jump, stand-sit, stand, and walk. Several time-series data captured by the sensors were used as human motion features. One of the challenges of this study was the existence of human body motions whose features resembled those of body falls. In addition, unfixed smartphone positioning made human body falls harder to detect and can lead to high rate of misclassification (not detected as fall). This incident can caused serious bone fracture or even death if the person not handled as immediately as possible because of misclassification. To address this problem, we modified Resultant Acceleration and ∠ Y formulas to address the problem of unconstrained smartphone positions. We proposed to combine five methods such as AGVeSR, Alim, ∠α, GyroReDi, and AGPeak to build a robust detector model to reduce the misclassification. The experiment results showed that the accuracy of the combination of both sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) outperformed the accuracy of accelerometer only by more than 15%. The decision fusion that used voting involving five methods could boost the accuracy rate by up to 4.15%. © BEIESP.","Accelerometer; Gyroscope; Human fall detection; Unconstrained smartphone positions",,,,,,,"de la Concepción, M.Á.Á., Morillo, L.M.S., García, J.A.Á., González-Abril, L., Mobile activity recognition and fall detection system for elderly people using ameva algorithm (2017) Pervasive and Mobile Computing, 34, pp. 3-13;

The views that arise are views that come from various backgrounds of shareholder members and property stakeholders who are in the circle of residential property supply chain, including property owners and everyone who becomes working and in touch with the property business itself. The data obtained from qualitative and quantitative research give a lot of understanding and input to see the role of CSR and the relation of the performance of property company organization in Indonesia which is generally incorporated in Real Estate Indonesia membership (REI). Property firms provide data representing owners and supply chain properties with careful observation of the company’s CSR activities. The fundamental findings found by the researcher is the existence of adequate understanding level of CSR, and still the scarcity of CSR program organizing in the property company that researched causing CSR in the property industry has not got big impact when compared with CSR done in other industries such as mine, oil and gas. In the future, the contribution of CSR is expected to be greater and more effective and have an impact in building the property especially the housing that can be reached by the wider community including informal sector along with the financing scheme which is not convoluted and can fulfill the backlog of public housing which is getting bigger from year to year. © 2019 IJSTR.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Housing; Informal sector; Organizational performance; Property; Shareholder; Stakeholder; Supply chain",,,,,,,"Pérez, A., Del Rodríguez Bosque, I., Salazar, J., Husted, B.W., Biehl, M., (2012) Measuring CSR Image: Three Studies to Develop and to Validate a Reliable Measurement Tool., , Journal citation; Salazar, J., Husted, B.W., Biehl, M., (2012) Thoughts on the Evaluation of Corporate Social Performance Through Projects., , Journal citation; Drucker, P.F., (2001) Management Challenges for the 21st Century, , Harper Business, New York, USA.

The project manager or project owner really needs a good calculation so that the use of resources can be done more efficiently. Use Case Points (UCP) is one method that can be used to measure the size of a software based on a use case diagram. Use case diagrams are usually made before the application begins to be developed into the application. In the calculation of UCP, there are 2 additional factors carried out: Technical Complexity Factor (TCF) and Environmental Factor (EF). This paper presents measurement software using use case points on the SIB mobile application. This application has never been measured both in terms of cost and size of the project. The results of the use case points method produce a UCP value of 129.86 and Effort Estimation (Effort) value of 1298.6 hours. With these results, the project manager gets a picture of the project so that the efficiency of the resources can be carried out properly. © 2019 ISSN.","Mobile application; Software cost; Software metric; Software size; Use case points",,,,,,,"(2018) Number of Apps Available in Leading App Stores as of 3rd Quarter 2018, , https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores; Kashyap, D., Shukla, D., Misra, A.

To avoid fraud, it can be done by blockchain technology by the use of University, Company, Traceability, Profit and Policy-making of crypto-governance. Crypto-governance is able to use IBM using hyperledger fabric protocol and private blockchain network. Muhammadiyah Tangerang University (UMT) saved the graduate documents storage manually by human resources. Moreover, it would be wasting time for many tasks, for example when staffs searched database, they would consume a lot of time and the graduate documents were vulnerable to damage in the disaster. Based on the problems above it would face the research questions; how did we keep the graduate documents storage secure and how it could be authentic guaranteed? Blockchain technology with distributed ledger and consensus is considered to overcome this problem.

Government has spent a lot of time, money, and sources to improve the public service but there are always challenges to improve public interest in using social media-based e-government applications. Web 2.0 and social media provide opportunities to user that is the community, stakeholders, and service providers to discuss and share opinions about features regarding people’s expectations. This study involved 349 people as end users and 10 service providers in producing e-government features based on social media according to their expectations. Society as application’s user was asked to see the current quality of social media-based e-government services based on end users. This aimed to conduct evaluations so that they could propose features for the development of social media-based e-government application. © 2019, ICIC International.

All ideas from the development of intelligent transportation to a town that wants to build and want to change into a smart city, especially in the field of ACP (system created, computing developed), based on parallel management and control system (PTMS). PTMS is considered to be enlarged to a new generation of an intelligent transportation system, and its essential component of architecture then make the hardware and software that will support a new architecture in a developing city to a smart city. The case in a lift is a communication system on a car that uses peer to peer networks and smart cards, with a communication system in a vehicle is expected to control congestion in a developing city through an original town with a connected system. This paper proposed four aspects of surveillance such as Traffic surveillance, vehicle Surveillance, passenger surveillance and driver surveillance. The combination of these surveillances will create best applied Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) or can be called as Smart Transportation Systems(STS). © 2018 IEEE.","Intelligent Transportation Systems;

Electronic learning (e-learning) using Internet and digital technologies to create experience in educating others. E-Learning in STMIK Mikroskil used to help students and lecturers in teaching and learning process. This study uses the UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) model. The aim is to analyze the tendency of users of e-learning systems at STMIK Mikroskil Medan, by testing whether Behavioral Intention and Behavior to Use a technology are influenced by Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, and Facilitating Conditions. These four factors are moderated by gender, experience, and voluntary factors. Questionnaire data were collected from 346 active students and analyzed by structural equation modeling (SEM) using AMOS 24. The results of this study showed Performance Expectation Factors, Effort Expectation Factors, Social Influence Factors had a positive effect on Behavioral Intention, Facilitating Conditions Factors had a positive effect on Use Behavior, Behavioral Intention has a significant influence on Use Behavior. Gender does not have a moderating effect that affects the factors of Performance Expectation and Effort Expectancy on Behavioral Intention, but Gender has a moderating effect that affects Social Influence factors towards Behavioral Intention. Experience does not have a moderating effect that influences Business Expectancy factors on Behavioral Intention. However, experience has a moderating effect that influences Social Influence factors that have a positive effect on Behavioral Intention. Experience also has a moderating effect that affects the Facilitating Conditions factor for Use Behavior. Voluntariness has a moderating effect that affects Social Influence factors towards Behavioral Intention. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","E-Learning; Effort Expectancy; Facilitating Conditions; Performance Expectancy; Social Influence; Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)",,,,,,,"Venkatesh, V., Morris, M.G., Davis, G.B., Davis, F.D., User Acceptance of Information Technology: Toward a Unified View, MIS Q (2003) Int.

It has transformed itself into not just a platform for social interactions, but into a powerful marketing tool. People posting pictures or information through social media will likely influence others seeing it. This research investigates the impact of social media postings on millennial (Gen Y) tourists’ decision in choosing destinations, as well as the perceptions of social media users toward the information they gather from the social media about the tourism destinations. World Travel and Tourism Council in its release in 2018 revealed that tourism industry represents 10.4% of total global GDP. The industry has also contributed 20% of new jobs globally created in the last decade. The findings from samples taken from respondents in greater Jakarta (Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang and Bekasi) show that social media contributes significantly on shaping the millennial tourists’ decision in choosing their holiday destinations. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Decision on destination; Impact; Perception; Social media; Tourists’ destination",,,,,,,"Bialik, K., Matsa, K.E., (2017) Key Trends in Social and Digital News Media, p. 4. , Pew Research Center; Dudensing, R.M., Hughes, D.W., Shields, M., Perceptions of tourism promotion and business challenges: A survey-based comparison of tourism businesses and promotion organizations (2011) Tourism Management, 32 (6), pp. 1453-1462; Felix, R., Rauschnabel, P.A., Hinsch, C., Elements of strategic social media marketing: A holistic framework (2017) Journal of Business Research, 70, pp. 118-126; Kovathanakul, D., Central Northeastern Thailand Tourism Branding, Supporting the ASEAN Economic Community (2015) Procedia Economics and Finance, 23, pp. 291-297; Lin, J., The effects of gratifications on intention to read citizen journalism news: The mediating effect of attitude (2014) Computers in Human Behavior, 36, pp. 129-137; Malik, A., Dhir, A., Nieminen, M., Uses and gratifications of digital photo sharing on Face-book (2016) Telematics and Informatics, 33 (1), pp. 129-138; Nunnally, J., Bernstein, I., (1994) Psychometric Theory 3Rd Edition, , (MacGraw-Hill, New York; Punyanunt-Carter, N.M., de La Cruz, J.J., Wrench, J.S., Investigating the relationships among college students' satisfaction, addiction, needs, communication apprehension, motives, and uses & gratifications with Snapchat (2017) Computers in Human Behavior, 75, pp. 870-875; Rodríguez-Molina, M.A., Frías-Jamilena, D.M., Castañeda-García, J.A., The contribution of website design to the generation of tourist destination image: The moderating effect of involvement (2015) Tourism Management, 47, pp. 303-317; Sánchez, M., Campo, S., Alvarez, M.D., The effect of animosity on the intention to visit tourist destinations (2018) Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, 7, pp. 182-189; Gao, J., Wang, G., Wu, J., Arsenic trioxide inhibits Skp2 expression to increase chemosensitivity to gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells (2019) Am J Transl Res, 11, pp. 991-997; Souiden, N., Ladhari, R., Chiadmi, N.E., Destination personality and destination image (2017) Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, 32, pp. 54-70; Strauss, W., Howe, N., (2000) Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation, p. 29. , New York: Vintage Books; Thai, N.T., Yuksel, U., Too many destinations to visit: Tourists’ dilemma?

Humans can sacrifice anything for health. Health needs to be supported by government facilities, one of which is a hospital. The development of hospitals in Indonesia is increasingly rapid. The availability of more hospitals needs to be supported by the resources available in the hospital. The problem that occurs at this time is that there are still many patients who complain about the lack of availability of resources both in terms of doctors, beds that must be included in the waiting schedule, medical technicians who sometimes queue up for blood collection, administrative processes that take a long time so patients are not immediately treated so on. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine the influence of resources (building area, general practitioners, specialist doctors, nurses, pharmacists, medical technicians, health workers, and non-health workers) on patients (outpatient, inpatient, and emergency room) ) in Indonesian hospitals. The method used is multiple regression with the help of SPSS 20. While the data taken is the population of all hospitals in Indonesia. The results obtained are three, first, building area, bed and medical conditions affect inpatient. Both general practitioners, medical technicians, health workers and non-health workers influence outpatients. Finally, beds, general practitioners, medical specialists, medical technicians, and health workers influence ED patients. Based on the results of these studies it can be suggested that the main focus for each type of patient needs to be considered especially those that have a significant effect. © 2019 iJOE.","Hospital; Patients; Regression; Resources",,,,,,,"Hn, S., (2015) Peranan Sektor Kesehatan dalam Pembangunan, , www.ajarekonomi.com:https://www.ajarekonomi.com/2015/12/kesehatan-sebagai-investasi-pembangunan.html, 12 17; Syukro, R., (2017) Ekonomi.

Despite its high accuracy, the model was not practical when high computing power was not available. Thus, deep model with not-so-deep structure or less number of model parameters is needed for low capacity computer. Logo and brand recognition task is an important and challenging problem in computer vision with wide potential applications. The inherent challenge to address this task is not only due to the presence of logo in various direction and clutters as well as imbalanced dataset but also because of high computing workload when deep learning models were adopted. This paper presents empirical results of logo recognition method using MiniVGGNet and MiniGoogleNet models combined with augmentation technique to increase variation and number of samples. The results show that the proposed model combined with augmentation technique increased accuracy of model accuracies and fasten training convergence of both models. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Augmentation technique; Logo detection; MiniGoogLeNet; MiniVGGNet","Database systems; Marketing; Augmentation techniques; Brand recognition; Computing workloads; Imbalanced dataset; Logo detections; MiniGoogLeNet; MiniVGGNet; Number of samples; Deep learning",,,,,"Acknowledgment.

In the midst of intense competition with vegetable oil producing countries in the world, Indonesia must have international competitiveness which is strongly supported by the technology in order to achieve a sustained competitive advantage. The major purpose of this paper is to examine the direct effect of technological resources to international competitiveness and sustained competitive advantage as well as measure the mediating effect of international competitiveness in the relationship between technological resources and sustained competitive advantage. For these purposes, an empirical survey was conducted with the active participation of 82 palm oil industries in Indonesia. In addition to the survey, in-depth interviews were conducted to follow up the quantitative results. On the basis of path analysis with SmartPLS, technology resources had positive and significant effect to sustained competitive advantage.

The k-NN algorithm works by making a prediction based on the closest data points between the old data history as training data and the new data as testing data. The data collected totals 1018 students with 24 scholarship receiver candidate students are used as the dataset for the test purposes. The attributes used in the prediction process are a semester, parents' income, number of family dependents, and Cumulative Grade Point Average. The distance calculation of the value from testing attribute to each training attribute uses Euclidean Distance equation, while the test of the model accuracy value is calculated using Confusion Matrix. The results of the simulation of the prediction model show that the determining factor of training data from both the number and the variation of different values can improve the performance of the k-NN algorithm with the best accuracy rate of 95.83 percent in predicting students who have the greatest chance of getting the scholarship. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Education computing; Forecasting; Motion compensation; Pattern recognition; Statistical tests; Students; Confusion matrices; Cumulative grade point averages; Distance calculation; Euclidean distance; K nearest neighbor algorithm; K-nearest neighbors; Prediction model; Prediction process; Nearest neighbor search",,,,,,"Kurniadi, D., Warnars Sasmoko, H.L.H.S., Gaol, F.L., Software size measurement of student information terminal with use case point in (2017) IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Computational Intelligence (CyberneticsCom), pp. 164-169; Aulawi, H., Ramdhani, M.A., Slamet, C., Ainissyifa, H., Darmalaksana, W., Functional Need Analysis of Knowledge Portal Design in Higher Education Institution (2017) Int.

E-learning system usage will be less than optimal if students refuse or cannot use the system. Therefore, an understanding of student acceptance behavior toward the system is also important in order to improve online learning environment. This study measures the acceptance of e-learning system using the extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). This study aims to determine the relationship between self-efficacy, subjective norm, and experience as exogenous constructs to perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness as endogenous construct followed by testing to determine the relationship between perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness toward behavioral intention to use on e-learning system usage in STMIK Mikroskil Medan. Questionnaire data was collected from 354 active students and analyzed with structural equation modeling (SEM) using AMOS 24. The result of this study showed that self-efficacy, subjective norm, and experience has significant positive effect on perceived ease of use. Perceived ease of use has significant positive effect on perceived usefulness. Perceived usefulness has significant positive effect on behavioral intention to use, but perceived ease of use has no significant effect on behavioral intention to use. This finding improves the understanding of student acceptance behavior toward e-learning system that can help improve the service of STMIK Mikroskil e-learning system and can be used as reference for doing other similar research. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","E-learning; Perceived ease of use; Perceived usefulness; Structural equation modeling; Technology acceptance model",,,,,,,"Hussein, R., Aditiawarman, U., Mohamed, N., (2007) E-Learning Acceptance in A Developing Country: A Case of the Indonesian Open University, , in German e-Science Conference; Tarhini, A., Hone, K., Liu, X., Tarhini, T., Examining the moderating effect of individual-level cultural values on users’ acceptance of E-learning in developing countries: A structural equation modeling of an extended technology acceptance model (2017) Interact.

The purpose of this research is to identify the important factors in Technology- Organization-Environment framework that affect ERP system adoption's intention. Online survey data were collected from 175 employees with active status from each department who had used ERP in PHG, Indonesia. The research data was collected through simple random sampling method and applying SEM in AMOS 24. The results of this article proves that technology readiness, organization size, and external support significantly influence ERP system adoption intention. Compatibility, relative advantage, complexity, top management support, business operation, and competition pressure have no significant influence on ERP system adoption intention. Thus, it can be concluded that ERP system adoption's intention is important to enhance corporate competitive advantage. Adopted ERP system can be developed continuously by involving employees to achieve information technology and business strategy within company.

Various government initiatives are implemented with the purpose to build services focused on the community needs and to provide better access to government services to its citizens. Government invests the resources, power, time, idea for the provision of e-government with the belief that it will improve the service quality to citizens. The goal of e-government initiatives is how the government improves services so that public trust and satisfaction are increasing. To make effective services, interface design was made to be more user-friendly. So it is necessary to develop a sustainable system by always doing interface design evaluation. Perceived quality is a determining factor for the success of important government services applications. Another thing to be done to increase the confidence and satisfaction of its citizens is e-government should be properly managed to avoid failure. © IAEME Publication.","E-government; Public service; Satisfaction;

This metrics used to identify measurable properties of the code and relation between them. Several measures can be calculated with this method are program vocabulary, program length, volume, difficulty and effort. In learning process, the final result obtained by students should be linear with the results obtained each time the students doing their exercises. This study aims to see the pattern similarity relationship between coding that students do on each exercise in term of difficulty, programming effort and programming time with the final value that they obtained. The experiment was done by giving the students three sets of exercise questions which were derived from the final problem, then each set of exercise code done by each students measured using halstead method and compare with the final grade obtained by each student. © 2018 IEEE.","halstead; pattern; programming; software metric","Codes (symbols); Mathematical programming; Complexity measures; halstead; Learning process; pattern; Pattern similarity; Programming time; Software metrices; Software metrics; Students",,,,,,"Arpaia, P., Bernardi, M.L., Di Lucca, G., Inglese, V., Spiezia, G., An aspect-oriented programming-based approach to software development for fault detection in measurement systems (2010) Comput.

In recent years there have been several studies that have used games, especially computer-based ones to improve the executive function of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) especially in working memory improvements. There are still several obstacles in using computer-based games that have been circulating today in Indonesia. The aim of this research is to develop and create a prototype game that can be used to improve working memory of children with ADHD using Bahasa Indonesia. The prototype game application is a race game with matching colors and memory work tasks; developed using Construct2. Players will play as a driver, delivering certain fruits to specific homes with different colors. The game also included visuospatial tasks such as remembering the objects.

Every year, the number of mobile application is increased. It is important for mobile application project owners to calculate the required resources before building a mobile application. In software metric, Use Case Points method is able to count software size of mobile application based on their functionality. This method utilizes use case diagram as their computation factors in the estimation process. Moreover, two other complexity factors are also considered in this method, which are: Technical Complexity Factor and Environment Factor. In this paper, we present software size calculation of QuestDone Mobile Application using 7 steps use case points method. QuestDone has been implemented, but we do not know its software size (i.e. how big the software, how much it cost, how many people is needed). As the result from use case points method, the Use Case Points value of QuestDone is 126.88 with Effort Estimation equal to 889 hours. The software size estimation process of QuestDone Mobile Application detailed in this paper can give an insight to project owners to count software size of other similar projects. © 2017 IEEE.","mobile application; software metrics; software size; use case points","Artificial intelligence; Mobile computing; Environment factors; Estimation process; Mobile applications; Software metrics; Software size; Software size estimation; Technical complexity; Use case points; Application programs",,,,,,"Costello, S., How Many Apps Are in the App Store?""

However, testing process is a time-consuming activity that requires good planning and a lot of resources. Therefore, technique and methodology for predicting the testing effort is important process prior the testing process to significantly increase efficiency of time, effort and cost usage. Correspond to software metric usage for measuring software quality, software metric can be used to identify the faulty modules in software. Furthermore, implementing machine learning technique will allow computer to 'learn' and able to predict the fault prone modules. Research in this field has become a hot issue for more than ten years ago. However, considering the high importance of software quality with support of machine learning methods development, this research area is still being highlighted until this year. In this paper, a survey of various software metric used for predicting software fault by using machine learning algorithm is examined. According to our review, this is the first study of software fault prediction that focuses to PROMISE repository dataset usage. Some conducted experiments from PROMISE repository dataset are compared to contribute a consensus on what constitute effective software metrics and machine learning method in software fault prediction. © 2017 IEEE.","machine learning algorithm; software defect prediction; Software metric; software testing","Artificial intelligence; Computer software selection and evaluation; Forecasting; Learning systems; Life cycle; Software design; Software testing; Fault-prone modules; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Machine learning techniques; Software defect prediction; Software development life cycle; Software fault prediction; Software metrices; Learning algorithms",,,,,,"Kumar, L., Krishna, S., Sureka, A., Ku, S., Effective fault prediction model developed using Least (2017) Square Support; Kumudha, P., Venkatesan, R., Cost-sensitive radial basis function neural network classifier for software (2016) Defect Prediction, 2016; Malhotra, R., Jain, A., Fault prediction using statistical and machine learning methods for improving software quality (2012) J.

However, in this paper we do not interested with political conversation, how one candidate couples can win or how one candidate couples could lose. We are interested to learn based on our science knowledge in Computer Science perspective particularly with the term of Data Mining with this 5 years DKI Jakarta event program. Hopefully, by reading this paper the students of Computer Science can understand their Computer Science knowledge in their surrounding life events. Obviously, voters' decisions are influenced by human nature characteristic which like to similarity preferences, where human like to choose someone who have full or frequent similarity in profile and/or program. Beforehand, voters should do learning by doing the characterization of their and candidate couples' profile and program. Afterwards, based on candidate couples' profile and program, the voters will do discrimination between candidate couples, classification, clustering or association among candidate couples.

Most of IT uses in these schools can be recognized from the technical aspects of IT and factor management determining the success of IT application. There are 149 active private schools of informatics management and computing in Indonesia. However, only 6 (4.03%) of them were institutionally accredited with Grade B. The other 21 schools were institutionally accredited with Grade C (14.09%) and none obtained Grade A. Schools of informatics management and computing are holders of most study programs of computing and IT. The measurement of IT performance was conducted based on the aims on the use of IT, process performance, and IT outcomes. The result would be used to determine IT performance of schools of informatics management and computing. Therefore, the aims were on this aspect related to IT knowledge, IT strategy, IT alignment and IT innovation. This research used a causal-explanatory method. This research applied a mixed method (quantitative and qualitative method). It was based on the previous relevant studies on the relationships among these variables. It developed the conceptual framework and hypotheses showing these relationships.

Development of small medium enterprises in Jakarta, Indonesia is very fast, that it makes intense competition between small medium enterprises. This research aims at finding the impact of information system strategy on business competitiveness among small medium enterprises moderated by technology dependency. Questionnaires are distributed to low to top level management of small medium enterprises in Jakarta. Data are analyzed using Structural Equation Model with Partial Least Square method. The result proves that there are significant effects of information system strategy on business competitiveness of small and medium enterprises. Hence, IS/IT strategy does contribute to enhancing competitiveness of small and medium enterprises. The contribution however varies between 57 to 67 percent from the four Business Balanced Score Card perspectives. It was also found that there are no significance differences between technology dependent enterprise and non-technology dependent enterprise on the impact of IS/IT strategy on competitiveness of the SMEs. © 2005 - Ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Business competitiveness; Information system strategy; Partial least square; Small medium enterprises; Technology dependency",,,,,,,"Arslan, Tathdil, N.H., Defining and Measuring Competitiveness: A Comparative Analysis of Turkey with 11 Potential Rivals (2012) International Journal of Basic & Applied Sciences, 7 (2); Asemi, L., The Role of Management Information System (MIS) and Decision Support System (DSS) for Manager's Decision Making Process (2011) International Journal of Business and Management, 6 (7); Baltzan, P., Phillips, A., (2010) Business Driven Technology, , 4th.

The methodology includes an empirical study that was conducted in education franchising in Indonesia. The results show that the quality of relational relation is important in improving franchisee performance results. Meanwhile, entrepreneur orientation as a moderator variable gives an effect towards the improvement of franchisee performance. From the four indicators of entrepreneur orientation, in education franchise context in Indonesia, the most required indicator is the courage to take risks. This quality is required by franchisee in increasing franchisee performance because without courage to try new things and find creative ideas, franchisee performance will not improve.

A wood-based industry has competitive advantage and comparative advantage. It becomes the mainstay of economy in Indonesia. As a country that has the second largest forest area in the world, Indonesia got less successful in forest industry plants based Transmigration. This becomes an interesting phenomenon. From the point of previous literature review can be seen that variety aspects related to the impact of the strength of strategic planning and corporate performance such as in studies on the assessment outline controversy and inconsistency in general. Some research groups on strategic planning effectiveness showed positive performance, and another research showed negative performance. However, there has no research related to the strategic planning effectiveness impacts to the performance of the forest industry plants until now. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of three constructs of strategic planning. The independent variables are managerial, environmental and organizational culture factors in relation to the company performance either directly or indirectly. This research was conducted by collecting questionnaire data from respondents, and was developed the answers from several theories. The results of research described that there is no significant relationship between strategic planning and corporate performance. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Corporate performance; Economy; Effectiveness; Environment; Managerial; Organizational culture; Strategic planning",,,,,,,"Aram, J.D., Cowen, S.S., (1990) Strategic Manage.

HR signs occur because of narrowing of the arteries in the retina, bleeding in the retina of the eye and cotton wool spots. The diagnosis is conventionally performed by an ophthalmologist by performing fundus image analysis to determine the phases of HR disease symptoms. This paper proposes an early detection system of hypertensive retinopathy disease. We propose to use Fundus image as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) input to determine whether there are any HR symptoms or not. The proposed system is tested by DRIVE image dataset and base on experiment, the accuracy of proposed method is 98.6%, where the more the number of iterations the higher the accuracy level of the training. © 2017 The Authors.

The integrity of the digital evidence must be maintained through the chain of custody in order to be admissible in court. Most digital extraction tool use either MD5 (Message Digest) or SHA (Secured Hash Algorithm) hashing to check the integrity of digital evidence. The hashing algorithm has been found to have a weakness known as collision in which two different messages have the same hashing values. Although the probability of producing such weakness is very small, this collision can be used to deny the usage of the evidence in court of justice. After the first collision has been found, many cryptanalysts have tried to explore various methods to detect the collisions with shorter and efficient time. This paper is to review the existing methods in digital forensic tools that have been used to create a collision attacks in digital evidence. © 2017 The Authors.

The research model is applied on two groups, one at the State University, the other at a Private University. in Jakarta and West Java. The data is analysed using Structure Equation Model using Wrap PLS. The results show that overall, the relationship between variables in the Private Universities is stronger than in State Universities suggesting students in the Private University are more diffused by innovation than those in the State University.","Consumer Behaviour; Diffusion of Innovation; Satisfaction; Website Service",,,,,,,"Adler, P.S., Market, hierarchy, and trust: The knowledge economy and the future of capitalism (2001) Organization Science, 12 (2), pp. 215-234; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Anderson, E., Sullivan, M., Antecedents and consequences of customer satisfaction for firms (1993) Marketing Science, 12 (2), pp. 125-143; (2013) Indonesia Internet Users, Asosiasi Penyelenggara Jasa Internet Indonesia, , http://www.apjii.or.id/v2/index.php/read/page/halaman-data/9/statistik.html, APJII; Belanche, D., Casalo, V.C., Guinalin, M., Fostering future purchase intentions through website interaktivity: The mediating role of consumer trust (2011) Advance in Information Service Science, 3, p. 5; (2012) Bureau of Indonesian Statistic, , http://www.bps.go.id/booklet/Boklet_Agustus_2013.pdf; Castro, L.M., Sanches, A.M., Criado, M., Innovation in services industries: Current and future trends (2011) The Service Industries Journal, 31 (1), pp. 7-20; Chin, W.W., Marcolin, B.L., Newsted, P.R., A partial least squares latent.

To combine both systems, blended learning is created. In Extention Program of Informatics Engineering Faculty at XYZ university most of the students already have jobs. As much 47,5 % of students who take this program have a job in daily office hours. Then, to facilitate the learning process the XYZ university develop learning management system (LMS) by Moodle. XYZ university want to make a learning process with blended learning concept. However, the Moodle sytem has limited function to adapt the blended learning system (BLS). In the aim to improve the class usability in BLS, then this study proposes to apply to Blended Learning System Structure (BLESS) into LMS design. BLESS is offered as a framework which matches to learning and uses a top-down approach. Then, the system design maed it ""Mixtio"". At the end of this study, it can be seen the analysis result of the use of BLESS can improve system usability of LMS. © 2019 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Blended learning; BLESS; E-learning; Usability",,,,,,"Tick, A., (2006) The Choice of E-Learning or Blended Learning in Higher Education, , 4th Serbian-Hungarian joint Symposium on Intelligent Systems; Matukhin, D., Evseeva, A., Further Professional Training as a Constituent Part of Continuing Vocational Education (2014) Lecture Notes in Management Science, 2nd International Conference in Humanities, 31, pp. 104-109. , Social Sciences and Global Business Management; Derntl, M., Motshnig-Pitrik, R., Employing Patterns for Web-Based, Person-Centered Learning: Concept and First Experiences (2004) Ed Media: World Conference on Educational Media and Technology 2003; Buran, A., How to Use Blogs in Creating Special Opportunities for Language Learning (2015) Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences, 6 (1), pp. 532-536; Garrison, D.R., Kanuka, H., Blended learning: Uncovering its transformative potential in higher education (2004) The Internet and Higher Education, 7, pp. 95-105; Thurab-Nkosi, D., Blended learning at the University of the West Indies, St (2013) Augustine: a first look at policy implementation.

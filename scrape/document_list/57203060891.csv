Factors that cause fires in homes or buildings tend to be caused by electrical short circuit and LPG gas cylinders. Losses due to fire are in the form of moral, material and life. This research focuses on making microcontroller-based devices to prevent fires by turning off electricity based on smoke and fire detection and sending short messages (SMS) to registered numbers. This device is designed using Arduino Uno, fire sensor, smoke sensor, sim card module, and doorbell to produce sound. © 2020 IEEE.","LPG; Short message; Smoke detection","Electric circuit breakers; Electric network parameters; Information management; Liquefied petroleum gas; Smoke; Timing circuits; Automatic circuits; Fire detection; Fire-sensor; Microcontroller-based; Research focus; Short message; SIM cards; Smoke sensors; Fires",,,,,,"Luo, R.C., Su, K.L., Autonomous fire-detection system using adaptive sensory fusion for intelligent security robot (2007) Ieee/Asme Transactions on Mechatronics, 12 (3), pp. 274-281; Lukman Hakima, V.Y., Deteksi kebocoran gas lpg menggunaka detektor arduino dengan algoritma fuzzy logic mandani (2017) Rekayasa Sist.

The disabilities can take a form as hearing impaired. We, at Distance Education Binus Online Learning (BOL), were keen to observe the implementation of ADAB (Ayo Dengar Ayo Bicara) To Connect application for hearing-impaired students in video conference sessions. The current study was aimed at seeking learning model innovations in data and text mining courses as well as measuring impacts of ADAB to Connect application to hearing-impaired students' academic performances. It was observed that by implementing the application, the students' academic performance was elevated to 90%. We, therefore, are convinced that this learning innovation worths further study and improvisation. © 2019 Kassel University Press GmbH.","ADAB; Distance-earning; Hearing-impaired; Innovation","Audition; Education computing; Learning systems; Students; Text mining; Academic performance; Conference sessions; Hearing impaired; Human being; Learning models; Online learning; Persons with disabilities; Physical barriers; E-learning",,,,"Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Tinggi, DIKTI","General Director Pensus Belmawa DIKTI to fully fund this article.","(2016) Salinan Undang Republik Indones Nomor 8 Tahun 2016 Tentang Penyandang Disabil, 2016 (147), pp. 11-40. , https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/xtdba; (2012) Kementrian Kesehatan Republik Indonesia.

The data used is the data of student learning transactions in 2016 and 2017 as many as 16000. There are 4 assessment indicators of distance learning student learning outcomes, namely Forum discussion (FOD), Personal assignment (PAS), TAS and Quiz (QIZ). The technique is then discussed in terms of prediction accuracy, using machine learning with the Naïve Bayes algorithm with the Rapid Miner application. The results state that student activity in the FOD discussion forum is the biggest indicator that influences student learning outcomes. With performance vector result accuracy of 84.03%. With an active group discussion forum with diverse backgrounds and student characteristics, most of which are workers showing activities, the discussion forum provides knowledge sharing between students and lecturers in the learning process to be both very good and important. © 2019 IEEE.","distance learning; Machine learning; Naïve bayes; online learning; recommender system","Distance education; Engineering education; Forecasting; Machine learning; Assessment indicator; Group discussions; Knowledge-sharing; Learning achievement; Performance vectors; Prediction accuracy; Student characteristics; Student learning outcomes; Students",,,,,,"Kaewkiriya, T., Utakrit, N., Tiantong, M., The design of a rule base for an e-learning recommendation system base on multiple intelligences (2015) Int.

This alternative offers you online learning interactions through synchronous and asynchronous session, which usually accommodated by learning management systems or another technology platform and applications. Basically, in online learning environment, the learning interaction will have a transition from teacher-dependent to learner-dependent, but it still can't be concluded that the succession in online learning doesn't affected by the teaching styles of the instructor. This study is aimed to see whether the teaching styles of the instructors will have an impact in academic achievement of the students. The study was conducted by a comparative study towards two classes with two different instructors, which have their own teaching styles. The result said that the class with the more active and responsive instructors has a better results in score. © 2017 IEEE.","academic achievement; learning interaction; online learning; teaching styles","Computer aided instruction; Information management; Online systems; Teaching; Academic achievements; Comparative studies; Learning interactions; Learning management system; Online learning; Online learning environment; Teaching styles; Technology platforms; E-learning",,,,,,"Kurniali, S., An approach to online learning using learning management system in higher education institution (2014) J.

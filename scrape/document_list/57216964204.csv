Since there is limited research in Indonesia to explain this issue, many hoteliers will need to take advantage of new research with this trend of growing numbers of female travellers in Indonesia. The objective of this study was to briefly examine the satisfaction of female business travellers in Indonesia related to desired hotel attributes. This research used a quantitative analysis and structured questionnaires which were distributed to 150 respondents who were female business travellers. The method of collecting the data was by spreading online questionnaires through Google forms. To analyze the data, SPSS statistics software was used to run multiple linear regression tests. The results of the research indicate that the facility safety and security and room quality are the key significant factors for female business traveller's satisfaction with hotel attributes considered. It can be said that Indonesians female business travellers prefer valuing their satisfaction of hotel attributes depending on facilities provided by the hotel industry. So, using this research the hotel industry can perhaps gain female business traveller satisfaction based on the attributes provided by focusing on the provision of a facility which has safety and security, clean rooms and things such as fast internet connections, and entertaining TV cable channels. © 2019 AJHTL Authors.","Facility; Female business traveller; Hotel industry; Indonesia; Satisfaction",,,,,,"Albayrak, T., Caber, M., Prioritisation of the Hotel Attributes According to Their Influence on Satisfaction: A Comparison of Two Techniques (2015) Tourism Management, 46, pp. 43-50; Alegre, J., Garau, J., Tourist Satisfaction and Dissatisfaction (2010) Annals of Tourism Research, 37 (1), pp. 52-73; Amin, M., Yahya, Z., Ismayatim, W.F.A., Nasharuddin, S.Z., Kassim, E., Service Quality Dimension and Customer Satisfaction: An Empirical Study in the Malaysian Hotel Industry (2013) Services Marketing Quarterly, 34 (2), pp. 15-125; Anton, J., Customer Relationship Management: Making Hard Decisions With Soft Numbers (1997) Journal of Leisure Research, 29 (3), p. 355; Artaya, I.P., Arimbawa, I.G., Croostab's Method of Use to Test the Linearity Hotel Facilities Variable (2018) Workers and Credibility Competency Level Customer Satisfaction With Service in Denpasar Hotel Inna Grand Bali Beach, , https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324983866; (2014), https://languages.oup.com/; (2019) Keadaan Angkatan Kerja di Indonesia, , BPS, Indonesia; Baker, S., Huyton, J., Bradley, P., (2000) Principles of Hotel Front Office Operation, , 2nd edn.

Fraud detection is very important because service providers can feel a significant loss of income. We conducted a fraud research case study on one of the operators that experienced fraud in 2009 and 2018. Call Detail Record (CDR) containing records of customer conversations such as source and destination number, call start time, duration of calls at the operator can be a source of information to use in fraud detection. The method used in this study uses machine learning with unsupervised learning techniques which are quite popular methods used in fraud detection. The purpose of this study is to propose an effective method that can be applied to detect fraud on the CDR. Variables used include caller number, number dialled, duration, fee and destination city of the dataset totalling 11,418 rows from record periods 01 to 31 May 2018. In analyzing our CDR using the K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms, we then evaluate the results to calculate accuracy by comparing to actual fraud data. Based on evaluations using confusion matrix on actual CDR fraud, we obtained the K-Means algorithm to show a better accuracy value to model fraud on telecommunications CDR compared to DBSCAN. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

This paper uses the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method in identifying, evaluating, and interpreting various methods of studies related to vessel anomalous behavior at the sea the author highlights several methods that are always applied to studies that already exist in detecting vessels anomalous behavior, the study detected the movement of vessel with AIS data from the history of vessel locations and fusion with another sensor in seeing movements of abnormal vessel behavior through patterns that were formed. This paper refers to various studies and reviews some of them about the use of AIS track data history in vessel including combining with other data to detect anomalous behavior of vessel, the results of the analysis are used to find out activities that have the potential for illegal activities or other crimes that can be detrimental and can be used as decision making, the authors hope the results of this paper can be an option to be applied to the surveillance system of vessel around the territorial waters in order to guard against crime and other illegal behavior. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

However, the nature of XBRL which is oriented towards documents and based on XML makes the XBRL taxonomy difficult to use because the information cannot be directly read by ordinary users. The same obstacle was felt by the Financial Services Authority of Indonesia (Indonesian: Otoritas Jasa Keuangan or OJK) as financial regulator in utilizing the XBRL taxonomy, therefore a web-based application system called E-Reporting was developed to input financial statements conducted from financial service institutions to the regulator. The core of the application system is the XBRL taxonomy reading and mapping function, utilizing the Java library for reading XML and the Spring Java framework as a system backend, the Zkoss framework as the system frontend, and the database for storing data and specifically developed for the needs of the OJK. The purpose of this paper is to show other ways of implementing XBRL taxonomy, one of which is to present XBRL into a dynamic user interface according to the dynamic and flexible nature of XBRL. The results of the system evaluation indicate that the system is quite good at presenting the taxonomy into a user interface that suits the needs and can ease the burden of data validation, as well as providing convenience in forming the instance document, which is needed as the final result of the reporting process carried out by financial service institutions. Therefore, this system has been proven to provide added value in the use of XBRL taxonomy in financial reporting activities. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Based on the problem, identifying the face of the query in low resolution, based on high resolution (64x64) proves to be a huge challenge. The aim of this research is to develop a new model for face recognition of low-resolution image in order to increase the accuracy of recognition. A Multi-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (MRCNN) is proposed to address the problem. First, Antialiasing is used in preprocessing phase, then use MRCNN to extract the feature of the image. LWF (Labeled Face in Wild) will be used to evaluate the model. The result of this study is increasing the accuracy of face recognition on low-resolution image compared to the previous MRCNN model. © Science and Information Organization.","Antialiasing; Convolutional neural network; Face recognition; Low resolution",,,,,,"ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by Research Grant No. 225/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019 from Ministry of Research Technology and Higher Education of Republic of Indonesia.","Dandpat, S.K., Meher, S., ""Performance improvement for face recognition using PCA and two-dimensional PCA"" (2013) in International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics; Kan, M., Shan, S., Zhang, H., Lao, S., Chen, X., ""Multi-view discriminant analysis"" (2015) IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence, 38, pp. 188-194; Abiantun, R., Juefei-Xu, F., Prabhu, U., Savvides, M., ""SSR2: Sparse Signal Recovery for Single-Image Super-Resolution on Faces with Extreme Low Resolutions.""

Several factors have been found and determined potentially capable to stimulate dropouts. Many researchers have been applied data mining methods to analyze, predict dropout students and also optimize finding dropout variables in advance. The main objective of this study is to find the best modeling solution in identifying dropout student predictors from 17432 student data of a private university in Jakarta. We also analyze and measure the correlation between demographic indicators and academic performance to predict student dropout using three single classifiers, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB) and Decision Tree (DT). We found indicators such as student’s attendance, homework-grade, mid-test grade, and finals-test grade, total credit, GPA, student's area, parent's income, parent’s education level, gender and age as student’s dropout predictors. The results only get 64.29 (NB), 64.84% (DT), and 75.27%(KNN) while we tried to combine algorithms with Ensemble Classifier Methods using Gradient Boosting as meta-classifier and gets better about 79.12%.

A consumer act as a seller put their product in a platform later will be displayed to another consumer act as a buyer. This condition encourages platform to maintain high quality product information especially image that is provided by the seller. Product images need to be relevant to the product itself. It can be controlled automatically using image classification. In this paper, we carried out a research to find out the best deep learning model in image classification for e-commerce products. A dataset of 12,500 product images is collected from various web sources to be used in training and testing process. Five models are selected and fine-tuned using a uniform hyperparameter set-up. Those hyperparameters are found by using a manual process by trying a lot of hyperparameters. The testing result from every model is presented and evaluated. The result shows that NASNetLarge yield the best performance among all evaluated models with 84% testing accuracy. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.","Deep learning; E-commerce; Hyperparameter tuning; Image classification; Product images",,,,,"23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019","This work was supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia, through research grant number 23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019.","Das, K., Gryseels, M., Sudhir, P., Tan, K.T., 'Unlocking Indonesia's digital opportunity,' (2016), pp. 1-28. , October; Dan, C., 'Consumer-To-Consumer (C2C) Electronic Commerce: The Recent Picture,' (2014) Int.

A great amount of researches aimed to realize a tracking system that works inside a building. However, only few researches uses BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). In a tracking system using BLE, its position strongly determines the accuracy of the position of the object. Therefore, the goal of this research was to develop a positioning system using Bluetooth generation 4 and Bluetooth Low Energy based on the distance measurement. In this research, the trilateration technique applied at 4 models position was analyzed: AOTG (All on the Ground), UBS (Upper Beacon and Smartphone), UBLS (Upper Beacon Lower Smartphone) and LBUS (Lower Beacon Upper Smartphone). The experiment provided in this paper indicated that the best result achieved from the four models is shown by AOTG models with the direct line of sight between a beacon and a smartphone, which was fulfilled. The average error generated is 0.771meter. The second best result has been given by LBUS that has an average error of 0.841 meter. The third best result has been given by UBS that has an average error of 1.061 meter and the worst one has been given by UBLS that has an average error of 1.217 meter. © 2018 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.

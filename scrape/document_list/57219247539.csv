The game will use Procedural Content Generation to minimize the amount of resource needed and incorporating the theme that will be beneficial to learn something about Mental Illness. A game that were made using Procedural Content Generation, but there are not yet a game that combines this with a Tangential learning element of Mental Illness. This thesis focuses on the development of the game from the start to finish and conduct game test to see how effective it is as an enjoyable game that indirectly give someone new information about Mental Illness. This testing is done by doing a post-test survey to measure the player’s experience, whether they learned something new or not and whether their experience is enjoyable or not. Based on the survey, the majority of players answered that they have learned something new and/or received the message of the game, and they rated their experience as good. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

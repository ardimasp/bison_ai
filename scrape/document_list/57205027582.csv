The application of Knowledge Management is also widely used to improve the quality of human resources. Especially for the type of industry that requires high HR capabilities where the individual capabilities of its HR are very influential to the results of the quality of its products. The purpose of this study is to provide a solution to the problems faced by PT. GAI, especially in the production section where the knowledge and ability of cutting, installation, repair of window film on the car are not evenly distributed in all existing HR, including the absorption of knowledge on new types of cars. The method used is Knowledge Spiral Model (SECI Model) from Nonaka and Takeuchi where there are 4 stages of the process, namely socialization, externalization, combination and internalization are needed PT. GAI for enhancing their HR capability. The results of the analysis show that PT GAI is a company that is rich in knowledge, but less well-organized need to build KM application to enables organization sustainability and strengthening their organizational human resources. Therefore, it is necessary to have a good Knowledge Management System to enable organization learning, where all employees can share and put their knowledge and look for what they want in the system. This study aims to identify the application of Knowledge Management carried out by industrial companies that require high HR capabilities. This can be done if you want to apply knowledge management more broadly. Certainly, it will provide greater benefits to the world of industry in the future. © 2019 IEEE.","HR; knowledge; knowledge management; quality improvement","Human resource management; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Industrial companies; knowledge; Knowledge management system; Organization learning; Private companies; Quality improvement; Spiral models; Window film; Knowledge management",,,,,"Koenig, M.E.D., (2012) What Is KM?

The Knowledege Management combined with InformationTechnology is a key success factor for sustainable organization. The Information in Knowledge Management should be readyand easy to access from anywhere and anytime. The problem ininformation is the data is too much, and spread out anywhere inmany formats. In this condition, the user may not find theinformation or wasting time to search the correct informationaccording to their needs. The Knowledge Management System isdeveloped to answer the needs to find the data with efficient, reliable, and trust. The Knowledge management keeps the datasystematically, and easy to find based on several indicatordetermined by user. The saved information is available to alllevel in organization, from operational, tactical to strategic levelaccording to their position. The success of Knowledgemanagement is depend on the information technology. Thetechnology should be suitable with the system and support interms of scalability, security and mobility. The technology willcreate the Knowledge Repository, to enable data and informationis kept secure. The Knowledge Repository operation andmaintainance is designed with the concept of Data Warehouse. The knowledge will grow each time and the structure will growalong the grow of data. In this research, the model is PTAutochem Industry, the retail organization of HealthCare.

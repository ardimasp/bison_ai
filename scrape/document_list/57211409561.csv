The ultraturrax and high-pressure homogenizer were used to prepare 1.34±0.25 - 5.79±1.61 nm of nanoemulsion size which confirmed by particle size analyzer. The morphology observed by SEM that exhibited the oil globules were covered by chitosan. They were aggregated and rough droplets. Interactions among the materials were observed using FTIR which led to the presence of a new peak at 1736 cm-1. The coated strawberry by high-pressure homogenizer-emulsion showed the best result suppressing microbial (2.41±0.01) and mould-yeast (2.78±0.10) growth at the end of storage compared to control which were 3.37±0.02 and 3.69±0.14 for microbial and mould-yeast count respectively. © 2019 The Authors.","Chitosan; Edible coating; Microbial; Nanoemulsion; Nutmeg seed oil; Strawberry","chitosan; emulsifying agent; nutmeg oil; antimicrobial activity; Article; cinnamon; controlled study; food coating; food quality; food storage; food texture; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; microbial adhesion; microbial growth; mold; morphology; nanoemulsion; nonhuman; particle size; physical chemistry; plate count; scanning electron microscopy; strawberry; yeast",,"chitosan, 9012-76-4; nutmeg oil, 8008-45-5","Malvern, United Kingdom; Gea, Italy; Thermo","015/KM/ PKM/2018","We thank the Ministry of Research, Technology Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia which provide the funding of this research through the grant of Student Creativity Program - Research 2018 (015/KM/ PKM/2018).","Aitboulahsen, M., Zantar, S., Laglaoui, A., Chairi, H., Arakrak, A., Bakkali, M., Zerrouk, M.H., Gelatin-based edible coating combined with Mentha pulegium essential oil as bioactive packaging for strawberries (2018) Journal of Food Quality, 5, pp. 1-7. , https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/8408915; Aulakh, J., Regmi, A., Post-harvest food losses estimation - Development of consistent methodology (2013) In Selected Poster Prepared for Presentation at the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association’s AAEA and CAES Joint Annual Meeting, , 4 - 6 August 2013.

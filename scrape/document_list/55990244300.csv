This platform can help freelancers in Indonesia in finding project opportunities. Moreover, project owners who need people to work on their projects will be facilitated by this online marketplace. To see the feasibility we analyzed the current market situation and then design the freelancer online marketplace platform. Data are collected by distributing questionnaires and literature reviews have also been done to collect information regarding trend of online marketplace. We also use object-oriented method to analyze and design the freelancer online marketplace. Freelancer Online Marketplace provides business-driven service in collaborative way whereby it can be an opportunity for freelancers to find new job opportunities, increase their skills, and develop new experiences and portfolios. On the other Freelance Online Marketplace could be an effective option realizing or implementing an idea into a real finish product for Project Owners. © 2020 IEEE.","Freelance; Freelancer; Marketplace; Online marketplace; Project owner","Information management; Planning; Surveys; Feasibility studies; Job opportunities; Literature reviews; Market situation; Object oriented method; On-line marketplaces; Project owners; Prototype designs; Electronic commerce",,,,,"Oberman, R., Dobbs, R., (2012) The Archipelago Economy: Unleashing Indonesia's Potential, , McKinsey Global Institute; (2017) International Labour Organization ILO Office for Indonesia and Timor-Leste, , Indonesia Jobs Outlook 2017 Harnessing technology for growth and job creation; Green, Gig economy and the future of work: A fiverr. com case study (2018) Management and Economics Research Journal, 4, pp. 281-288; Norbäck, M., Styhre, A., Making it work in free agent work (2019) Scandinavian Journal of Management, 35 (4); Ramesh, A., Krishnamoorthy, L., Suhaimi Baharudin, A., Intention to adaption and influence of using online freelance portal among Malaysians (2016) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 11 (19), pp. 10020-10026; Gu, G., Zhu, F., Trust and disintermediation: Evidence from an online freelance marketplace (2018) Harvard Business School., , Working Paper 18-103; Abdul Ghafoor Kazia, R.M., (2014) The Freelancer: A Conceptual Review, pp. 1-7. , Sains Humanika; Kitching, J., Smallbone, D., Are freelancers a neglected form of small business?

By looking at these requirements, a safer way to communicate, such as Cryptography, has been developed. However, the result of this method is not sufficient, because it still risk from the interception of the sent data, caused by cryptography which only hides the data resulting the packaging to be suspicious and draw attention of the hijackers. Therefore, Steganography then developed in which not only hides the content, but also deceptive hijackers with packaging that is not suspicious. In this paper, we discuss the design of steganography which is applied in mobile devices (e.g. mobile phone) using the BPCS (Bit-Plane Complexity Segmentation) by hiding text message into the media reservoir of JPEG data types images. When using this method the message hiding capacity is larger than any other method, up to 40% of the image container. The simulation result reconstructed images which is measured by an objective assessment parameters, based on the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio PSNR, with efficient value obtained on average is 74.3294 dB which is well worth the image quality. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Cryptography; Mobile device; PSNR; Steganography",,,,,,"Cachin, C., (2005) Digital Steganography, , http://www.zurich.ibm.com/~cca/papers/encyc.pdf, Switzerland, Accessed on 30 December 2011; Bucklin, T., Davidson, C., Newman, D., Sergaves, J., Taylor, D., (2009) PSNR Quality Analysis Methodology, , http://techblog.cineform.com/, April 18, Accessed pada 20 Januari 2012; Chamorro, A.G.H., Miyatake, M.N., A new methodology of image steganalysis including for jpeg steganography (2010) Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics Conference (CERMA); Chen, Y.H., Huang, H.C., A copyright information embedding system for android platform (2011) Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing; Kawaguchi, E., (1999) A Research on Bit-Plane Complexity Segmentation Based Steganography, , Kyushu Institute of Technology; Kawaguchi, E., Eason, Richard.O., (1998) Principle and Applications of BPCS Steganography, , http://www.ece.umaine.edu/~eason/steg/SPIE98.pdf, Kitakyushu, Japan: Kyushu Institue of Technology.

An a priori ordering of the greediness of genetic algorithms is constructed based on the nature of selection strategy that favors fitter candidate solutions. For the implementers of genetic algorithms, this ordering represents the design space of genetic algorithms involving selection, replacement, and generation gap on which design decision should be taken. These relative orderings of the greediness were examined by experimental runs on timetabling benchmark problems. The results suggest that for a fixed computational budget, a high greediness can be achieved by biased selection with a large generational gap and elitism. © 2018 IEEE.","genetic algorithm; greediness; selective pressure; timetabling","Budget control; Information management; Scheduling; Bench-mark problems; Computational budget; Design decisions; Design spaces; greediness; Selective pressure; Timetabling; Genetic algorithms",,,,,,"Holland, J.H., (1975) Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems, , The University of Michigan Press; Eiben, A.E., Smith, J., From evolutionary computation to the evolution of things (2015) Nature, 521 (7553), pp. 476-482; De Jong, K., Sarma, J., Generation gaps revisited (1993) Foundation of Genetic Algorithms 2, Morgan Kaufmann, pp. 19-28; De Jong, K., (1975) An Analysis of the Behavior of A Class of Genetic Adaptive Systems, , Doctoral Thesis, Department of Computer and Communication Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; Eiben, A.E., Smith, J.E., (2015) Introduction to Evolutionary Computing, 2nd Edition, , Springer; Goldberg, D.E., Deb, K., A comparative analysis of selection schemes used in genetic algorithms (1991) The Foundation of Genetic Algorithms, 1, pp. 69-93; Back, T., Selective pressure in evolutionary algorithms: A characterization of selection mechanisms (1994) Proceedings of the First IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computing, IEEE World Congress of Computational Inteligence, (1), pp. 57-62; Möhlenbein, H., Schlierkamp-Voosen, D., The science of breeding and its application to the breeder genetic algorithm (1994) Evolutionary Computation, 1, pp. 335-360; Sahargahi, V., Drakhshi, M.F., Comparing the methods of creating educational timetable (2016) IJCSNS Int.

Some of these images are genuine, while some others have gone through modifications. Although the creation and posting of edited photographs in media are basically not prohibited, it becomes a problem when they are used improperly. Until now, the common practice in Indonesia when assessing whether an image has been modified or is original is still heavily dependent on human expert assessment that could be subjective. This research offers an alternative solution that is objective by developing a systematic image analysis method for distinguishing between original and modified image. The method utilizes high-level feature, namely the metadata of the image file, to differentiate between original and modified image. A prototype system was implemented in Visual Basic as a desktop application. The application used MS Windows GDI+. This prototype application can be used as a reliable and faster means to assist in fake image detection. However, as metadata-based analysis only detects whether a photograph has possibly been edited and it does not show which part of the photograph has been manipulated, future work includes development of pixel-based analysis approach. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Metadata; Photography; Alternative solutions; Analysis approach; Comparison study; Desktop applications; High-level features; Image analysis method; Image detection; Prototype system; Image analysis",,,,"Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Tinggi, DIKTI","This research is supported by DIKTI Hibah Bersaing research funding 2016.","Kaskus, (2014), Super-ngakak-meme-foto-syahrini-tiduran-di-padang-rumput-di-itali-yang-unyu- unyu Retrieved from http://www.kaskus.co.id/thread/53ce6cf45a5163b46f8b46f8/super-ngakak-meme-foto-syahrini-tiduran-di-padang-rumput-di-itali-yang-unyu-unyu/82; Indonesian Voices, G., (2015), http://www.globalindonesianvoices.com/18576/foto-mesra-ketua-kpk-abraham-samad-says-intimate-photos-with-elvira-devinamira-are-fake/; Forester, T., Morrison, P., (1994) Computer Ethics: Cautionary Tales and Ethical Dilemmas in Computing, , 2nd ed (Cambridge MA: MIT Press); (2007) Section 14: Best Practices for Image Authentication, , http://www.crime-scene-investigator.net/swgit-section14.pdf; Farid, H., (2009) A Survey of Image Forgery Detection IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 26 (2), pp. 16-25; Sencar, H., Memon, N., (2009) Overview of State-of-the-art in Digital Image Forensics Algorithms, Architectures and Information Systems Security, p. 325; Mahdian, B., Saic, S., A bibliography on blind methods for identifying image forgery (2010) Image Communication, 25, pp. 389-399; Mahdian, B., Saic, S., Nedbal, R., JPEG quantization table forensics: A statistical approach (2010) Proceedings of International Workshop on Computational Forensics, pp. 150-159; Kakar, P., Sudha, N., Ser, W., (2011) Exposing Digital Image Forgeries by Detecting Discrepancies in Motion Blur IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 13, pp. 443-452; Popescu, A.C., Farid, H., (2005) Exposing Digital Forgeries in Color Filter Array Interpolated Images IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 53, pp. 3948-3959; Kakar, P., Sudha, N., Authenticating image metadata elements using geolocation information and sun direction estimation (2012) Proceedings of International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME), pp. 236-241; Working Group, M., (2010) Guidelines for Handling Image Metadata v2.0., , http://www.metadataworkinggroup.org/specs/; http://imageforensic.org/, Ghiro [Software]; Kee, E., Johnson, M.K., Farid, H., (2011) Digital Image Authentication from JPEG Headers IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 6 (3), pp. 1066-1075; http://raymondbahana.blog.binusian.org/rekayasa-photo-i; http://raymondbahana.blog.binusian.org/rekayasa-photo-ii",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Computing and Applied Informatics, ICCAI 2016","14 December 2016 through 15 December 2016",,127044,17426588,,,,"English","J.

Heuristics adopted from graph coloring theory have been used in many algorithms to solve timetabling problem. While it has been known that the application of these heuristics alone does not guarantee in producing feasible timetables, it will be useful if there exists any indicator of what condition the heuristics will lead to producing feasible timetables. In order to understand this condition, a constructive heuristic based on Least Saturation Degree First (LSDF) graph coloring is proposed in this work. Further, the quality of the generated feasible timetable is improved by a new operator based on a column permutation. These proposed algorithms attempt to solve the timetabling benchmark problems. Results are encouraging and provide useful insight into the solution of timetabling problem. © 2012 IEEE.","Benchmark Problem; Column Permutation; Graph Coloring; Timetabling","Bench-mark problems; Constructive heuristic; Graph colorings; Saturation degree; Timetabling; Timetabling problem; Two stage optimizations; Algorithms; Graph theory; Information science; Problem solving; Technology; Scheduling",,,,,,"Qu, R., Burke, E.K., McCollum, B., Merlot, L.T.G., Lee, S.Y., (2006) A Survey of Search Methodologies and Automated Approaches for Examination Timetabling, , The University of Nottingham, Nottingham; Chiarandini, M., Birattari, M., Socha, K., Rossi-Doria, O., An effective hybrid algorithm for university course timetabling (2006) Journal of Scheduling; Rossi-Doria, O., Blum, C., Knowles, J., Samples, M., Socha, K., Paechter, B., A Local Search for Timetabling Problem Proc. of the 4 th International Conference on Practice and Theory of Automated Timetabling 2002, Gent, Belgium, August 21-23; Lewis, R., (2006) Metaheuristics for University Course Timetabling, , School of Computing. vol.

Since the local search itself depends on the definition of the neighborhood operator, we intend to understand the effect of the employed neighborhood operator to the performance of MA.

The results reveal the importance of defining neighborhood operator suitable with the problems.

Visual Novels are very popular in Japan, where they make up nearly 70% of PC games released. However, due to its heavy contents of erotic things and sex scenes, this type of games are less acceptable in other regions. Despite its popularity, not many tools or engines are available to help visual novel creators to easily develop these games. The implemented prototype is developed using Java Swing. Basically, the program has two main components, the visual authoring interface and the compiler. The visual interface lets the users to specify the flow of the story and compose words, pictures, as well as sounds to tell stories. Having finished the composition, the users can compile it to a Java class simply by pressing a button, that can then run independently outside the authoring tool itself. Unlike other Visual Novels authoring tools that require users to write a script to specify the novels, the proposed tool provides a graphical interface to compose the novels. This visual approach frees the users from learning the scripting which normally is a an obstacle for non-technical users. It also facilitates the settings of users' involvement level in the composed novel that allows the creator of this novels to adjust how much engagement of the users is expected in the finished novels. A simple test on the users shows that this visual authoring interface can help non-technical users to develop a visual novel relatively easily. Moreover, since it uses Java Swing , the tool is ensured to work crossplatform.","Authoring tool; Game development; Java swing; Visual novel","Animation; IPTV; Java programming language; Program compilers; Security of data; Security systems; Software design; Authoring tool; Game development; Graphical interface; Java swing; Non-technical users; Visual authoring tools; Visual Interface; Visual novel; Computer games",,,,,,"(2008) AMN and Anime Advanced Announced Anime Game Demo Downloads, , http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/pressrelease.php?id=1510, February 18, Online.

Supporting tools design needs to be modified for the tools capability improvement and to provide new ways of working. The concept of innovative design can be applied to tools designing for up living the work way more productive in order to boost the manufacturing and service performances, meeting the mounted up customer demand. Taking the wrench product design as an example of observation and improvement initiative opportunity, this article discovers the chance of the mechanical and machinery products innovation, with the project methodology presented in applying the theories of product redesign from a manual conventional wrench to an advance design and puts forward the thought of the wrench innovative engineering design, principles and the process to electrical and mechanical mechanism. As a result, the proposed design scheme is evaluated, which indicates that the optimized design approach can be applied to a manual wrench design. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","improvement; machinery; product; redesign; tools; Wrench",,,,,,"Cooper, R.G., Kleinschmidt, E.J., New products: What separates winners from losers?

One of attempts to overcome this problem is the establishment of Malang Waste Bank (B.S.M.). The Quality Function Deployment with House of Quality approach is implemented for the evaluation in this study. Data are collected by distributing survey questionnaires to customers and by interviewing the B.S.M. to obtain information about the current state of the B.S.M.. Based on the questionnaire's result, the five points of Voice of Customer obtained. The relationship assessment between VoC and technical response conclude the most powerful influences toward customer's satisfactions. Thus, further researches regarding them are required to meet B.S.M.'s customer's needs, to attract more people to become the customers, and to succeed the B.S.M. program. © 2015 IEEE.","HOQ; QFD; Service; Waste","Function evaluation; Quality function deployment; Sales; Surveys; Waste management; Wastes; Bank managements; House-of-quality approach; Indonesia; Quality function deployments (QFD); Service; Voice of customer; Quality control",,,,,"(1991) Standar Nasional Indonesia (SNI) S-04-1991-03 Tentang Spesifikasi Timbulan Sampah Untuk Kota Kecil Dan Kota Sedang di Indonesia, , Badan Standarisasi Nasional (BSN), Departemen Pekerjaan Umum, Jakarta; (1992) Standar Nasional Indonesia (SNI) 19-2454-1992 Tentang Tata Cara Pengelolaan Teknik Sampah Perkotaan, , Badan Standarisasi Nasional (BSN), Departemen Pekerjaan Umum, Jakarta; (1994) Standar Nasional Indonesia (SNI), SIN 03-3241-1994, , Badan Standarisasi Nasional (BSN), tentang Tata Cara Pemilihan Lokasi Tempat Pembuangan Akhir Sampah Departemen Pekerjaan Umum, Jakarta; (1994) Standar Nasional Indonesia (SNI) 19-3964-1994 Tentang Metode Pengambilan Dan Pengukuran Contoh Timbulan Dan Komposisi Sampah Perkotaan, , Badan Standarisasi Nasional (BSN), Departemen Pekerjaan Umum, Jakarta; (2006) Permen PU Nomor: 21/PRT/M/2006 Tentang Kebijakan Dan Strategi Nasional Pengembangan Sistem Pengelolaan Persampahan (KSNPSPP), , Departemen Pekerjaan Umum, Jakarta; Penyusunan Pedoman Teknis Operasi Dan Pemeliharaan Pembangunan Prasarana Perkotaan, , Direktorat Bina Program, Diirjen.

Tourists are the main source of income for gross domestic income in Indonesia. However, although Indonesia as a beautiful archipelago country has so much offer to foreign and local tourist, until now it fails to give their potential to the country. Furthermore, the COVID-19 situation made Indonesia tourism worse. Travelling is banned as a consequence of lockdown in Indonesia. Business and economic need to adjust into their new normal. Unfortunately, in the midst of the current era of Internet technology and new normal, Indonesia’s tourism promotion is considered to be uneven and unwell targeted. Many tourist destinations are very interesting and clean but not yet known by potential tourists both from domestic and abroad due to the lack of targeted promotions and re-branding of a safe place to visit. Seeing to this prob-lem, this study aims to propose an integrated tourism system called SONIA, by using a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to build a personalized recommender system. Through this system integration model, a significant socio-economic benefit can be made for tourism sector in Indonesia. The results of the research will be exploited for the tourism industry and Indonesia’s participation in the global tourism competition market. © 2020, ICIC International.

The implementation of ML techniques has been largely focused on black box methods where the general conclusions are not easily interpretable. Hence, the elaboration with other declarative software models to identify the correctness and completeness of the models is not easy to perform. On the other hand, the emerge of some logic-based machine learning techniques with their advantage of white box approach have been proven to be well-suited for many software engineering tasks. In this paper, we propose the use of a logic-based approach to learn user preference in the form of pairwise comparisons. APARELL as a novel approach of inductive learning is able to model the user’s preferences in description logic representation. This offers a rich, relational representation which is then can be used to produce a set of recommendations. A user study has been performed in our experiment to evaluate the implementation of pairwise preference recommender system when compared to a standard list interface. The result of the experiment shows that the pairwise interface was significantly better than the other interface in many ways. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Decision Tree can be considered as one of the suitable methods for this problem due to its white-box approach, so that we can evaluate the result and re-use the model for further analysis, such as giving a recommendation. We used 10-fold cross-validation and hold-out technique to evaluate the performance of four different decision tree algorithms. The result shows that some decision tree algorithms like J48 outperform the others for learning pairwise preferences on a specific training split point.

Businesses are also utilizing this very rapid increase in internet technology. They sell products and services through the internet with various attractive offers and competing with each other to increase their sales. One strategy that can be done to get more sales is through the method of personalizing services for customers. The personalization aspect in e-tourism has been predicted to increase. Customers who are making valuable data at every stage of their journey are making a challenge for travel companies to collect and link these data points to improve their customer experience. Learning the customer behaviour can be very significant for Online Travel Agent. Because collecting millions of search results through their services and provide a smart travel experience, Online Travel Agent in Indonesia must use Big Data and Cloud technology alignment to win the competition in the market. The entire data lifecycle must be simple because of the needs of users to keep batch ingesting a lot of data likes once in an hour.

This is due to inability of the current technology to support the property products. Some people feel uncomfortable to buy houses from the online market. Buyers need to be very careful to deal with the sellers as the houses price is considered quite expensive. On the other hand, improving real estate market is still a challenge. This business still needs a physical representation, although it can be sold from the online market. In this paper, we propose the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) system of virtual reality and drone. We use drone to help scanning the property units and then make 3D models with visual mapping so it can be run in a virtual reality environment, video 360. In real estate, business process can be developed in various ways. Our proposed SOA in this study can be used to integrate all of them. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,"Nabila, M., (2018) APJII: Penetrasi Pengguna Internet Indonesia Capai, p. 143. , www.dailysocial.id/post/apjii-survei-internet-Indonesia-2017, access date 10 April Juta Orang; (2018) Statista Research Department, Number of Internet Users in Indonesia, , https://www.statista.com/statistics/254456/number-of-internet-users-in-Indonesia/, access date 09 April; Ma, Y., Sun, L., On relationship between real estate enterprise e-business model and its performance (2010) 2010 International Conference on Web Information Systems and Mining, p. 171; Xiong-Yi, L., Research and application of soa in b2b electronic commerce (2009) 2009 International Conference on Computer Technology and Development, p. 649; Cherif, E., Grant, D., Analysis of e-business models in real estate (2013) Electronic Commerce Research, 14, pp. 25-50; Footen, J., Service-oriented architecture (SOA) in media systems (2009) SMPTE Motion Imaging Journal, 118, pp. 33-37; Rao, B., Gopi, A.G., Maione, R., The societal impact of commercial drones (2016) Technology in Society, 45, pp. 83-90; Exner, K., Stark, R., Validation of product-service systems in virtual reality (2015) Procedia CIRP, 30, pp. 96-101; Mesbah, A., (2015) Advances in Computers, pp. 201-235. , ed A.

Despite their many practical advantages, the users of online shopping systems can be overwhelmed with the abundant information about the goods they want to buy. While some users start their search with a preference for certain items or manufacturers, others may find it difficult to narrow down the range of options being offered. The recommender system can assist the users to filter the information and show the most relevant items to the users. Despite being very popular in ecommerce area, research on recommender systems for education is still underexplored. Similar to the users of ecommerce system, some students may also feel overwhelmed by the available choices of material contents offered by the elearning system in which, it does not always suit to their learning style. This is important as some experts in educational psychology suggest that students need to learn by following their personal learning style. We propose an implementation design of e-learning recommender system based on a logic approach, APARELL (Active Pairwise Relation Learner), which has been implemented for used car sales domain. There is an opportunity to apply the same procedure for e-learning system to help the student to choose the best material according to their preferences. We also propose an ontology of material content based on the different learning styles. In this paper, we show that there is a big potential to implement a personalised recommender system in e-learning based on the students learning style. © 2019 IEEE.","e-learning; education; logic based approach; pairwise user preferences; recommender system","Automobile manufacture; E-learning; Electronic commerce; Intelligent systems; Online systems; Recommender systems; Students; E-commerce systems; Educational psychology; Implementation design; Material content; On-line Shopping systems; Online shopping; Personal learning; Students learning; Learning systems",,,,,,"Rivera, A.C., Tapia-Leon, M., Lujan-Mora, S., Recommendation systems in education: A systematic mapping study (2018) International Conference on Information Theoretic Security, pp. 937-947. , Springer, Cham; Rich, E., User modeling via stereotypes (1979) Cognitive Science, 3 (4), pp. 329-354; Yu, Z., Nakamura, Y., Jang, S., Kajita, S., Mase, K., Ontology-based semantic recommendation for context-Aware e-learning (2007) International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing, pp. 898-907. , Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg; Shishehchi, S., Banihashem, S.Y., Zin, N.A.M., A proposed semantic recommendation system for e-learning: A rule and ontology based e-learning recommendation system (2010) 2010 International Symposium on Information Technology, 1, pp. 1-5. , IEEE; Kolekar, S.V., Sanjeevi, S.G., Bormane, D.S., Learning style recognition using Artificial Neural Network for adaptive user interface in e-learning (2010) 2010 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research, Coimbatore, pp. 1-5; Tarus, J., Zhendong, N., Khadidja, B., E-learning recommender system based on collaborative filtering and ontology (2017) International Journal of Computer, Electrical, Automation, Control and Information Engineering, 11 (2), pp. 256-261. , World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology; Benhamdi, S., Babouri, A., Chiky, R., Personalized recommender system for e-Learning environment (2017) Education and Information Technologies, 22 (4), pp. 1455-1477; Strainu, R.M.P., Georgescu, M., SOA the link between modern educational technologies and mobile learning in the Higher Education Landscape (2017) Timisoara Journal of Economics and Business, 10 (1), pp. 120-133; Jati, G., Teaching Writing using web-log (2006) International Conference on Competency-Based Learning.

In the real world, buyers may be offered a lot of choices while trying to choose the item that best suits their preference. Such items may have many attributes, which can complicate the process. The classic approach in decision support systems-to put weights on the importance of each attribute-is not always helpful here. For instance, there are cases when users find it is hard to formulate their priorities explicitly. In this paper, we promote the use of pairwise comparisons, which allow the user preferences to be inferred rather than spell out. Our system aims to learn from a limited number of examples and using clustering to guide the selection of pairs for annotation. The approach is demonstrated in the case of purchasing a used car using a large, real-world data set. © 2017 IEEE.","inductive logic programming; mixed type data; pairwise comparisons; preference learning; Recommender system","Decision support systems; Machine learning; Recommender systems; Data set; Mixed type; Multi-attributes; Pair-wise comparison; Preference learning; Real-world; Used cars; Inductive logic programming (ILP)",,,,"20130622010016","Here we present a new approach to learning user preferences from pairwise comparisons. In this preliminary work, our algorithm can produce a very good accuracy result in the smaller length of clause. We need to follow the full idea of ILP by searching through all possible hypotheses to make a better prediction. For the next pair selection, we implement clustering technique to improve the value of the data being annotated, in a way resembling Active Learning approaches. This link should be explored more systematically in the future, ideally in an iterative setup where the next pairwise comparison is chosen on the basis of all previous answers, e.g. by drawing on existing work on Active Learning in recommender systems [12], [4]. Finally, while the simulated data has been very useful for evaluation purposes, we plan to perform an experiment with real users and involve them in the hypothesis validation.

An item may be characterised by many attributes, which can complicate the process. Here the classic approach in decision support systems - to put weights on the importance of each attribute - is not always helpful as users may find it hard to formulate their priorities explicitly. Pairwise comparisons provide an easy way to elicit the user's preferences in the form of the simplest possible qualitative preferences, which can then be combined to rank the available alternatives. We focus on this type of preference elicitation and learn the individual preference by applying one statistical approach based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), and two logic-based approaches: Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) and Decision Trees. All approaches are compared on two datasets of car preferences and sushi preferences collected from human participants. While in general, the statistical approach has proven its practical advantages, our experiment shows that the logic-based approaches offer a number of benefits over the one based on statistics.","E-commerce; Inductive logic programming; Inductive reasoning; Machine learning; Pairwise and mixed-type data comparisons; Recommender systems","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Computer circuits; Decision making; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Electronic commerce; Learning systems; Recommender systems; Support vector machines; Data comparisons; Individual preference; Inductive reasoning; Logic-based approach; Pair-wise comparison; Preference elicitation; Preference relation; Statistical approach; Inductive logic programming (ILP)",,,,"20130622010016

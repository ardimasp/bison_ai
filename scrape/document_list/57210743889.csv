Components that will be displayed in OLAP Analysis and Design Reports and Dashboards. This result will be used as a reference to build Business Intelligence, data warehouse and web reporting. The data warehouse designed in this study is very helpful in processing daily transaction data generated and stored in OLTP databases (Online Transactional Processing) into data that can be analyzed as Online Analysis Processing data using the Qlik Sense tool. Bl reports are designed to help in making research reports and can be tailored to the needs, so the problem of making reports can be overcome without using complicated programing codes. Bl Dashboard designed in this research, certainly very helpful for leaders in analyzing data to support decision making and can also be used to study sales trends and market analysis. © 2019 International Journal Of Scientific and Technology Research.

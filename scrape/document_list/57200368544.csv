In Indonesia there are several standards that are used to calculate the cost estimation of a project. One of the standards used in based on the Ministerial Regulation of Public Work No. 11/2013. However in a construction project, contractor often has their own cost estimation based on their own calculation. This research aimed to compare the construction project total cost using calculation based on the Ministerial Regulation of Public Work No. 11/2013 against the contractor's calculation. Two projects were used as case study to compare the results. The projects were a 4 storey building located in Pantai Indah Kapuk area (West Jakarta) and a warehouse located in Sentul (West Java) which was built by 2 different contractors. The cost estimation from both contractors' calculation were compared to the one based on the Ministerial Regulation of Public Work No. 11/2013. It is found that there were differences between the two calculation around 1.80 % - 3.03% in total cost, in which the cost estimation based on Ministerial Regulation was higher than the contractors' calculations. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","building contractor; construction project; cost estimation; ministerial regulation","Construction; Contractors; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Engineering research; Public works; Building contractors; Construction projects; Cost estimations; Indonesia; Jakarta; ministerial regulation; West javas; Cost estimating",,,,,"Rad Parviz, F., (2001) Project Estimating and Cost Management.

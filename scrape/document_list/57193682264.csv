As one of the biggest mosaic industry in Indonesia, Venus Tiles eager to give contribution in educational field, especially in developing knowledge about tiles as material to study in interior design. By distributing this specific product knowledge to students, industry elegantly inseminates its marketing strategy into educational institution. In Binus University, mosaic if one of topics that is essential to be learned by students in their fourth year of study. Students will gain knowledge through their learning experience, from installing tiles, developing conceptual and contextual design, enhancing sense of colours, and building their sensibility in aesthetical composition. Therefore, by applying this method, students will be able to gain knowledge theoretically and enhance their sensibility of space and design creativity while exploring materials in interior elements. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Exploration; Interior; Material; Mosaic; Pattern",,,,,,"Francisching, D.K., (2014) Building Construction Illustrated, p. 4. , John Wiley & Sons, New Jersey; (2015), Solusi Kebutuhan Konstruksi dan Teknologi Bangunan, Info, Pikiran Rakyat, April (2012), Online Article, accessed on October; Pile, J.F., (2007) Interior Design, p. 42. , 4th edn., Pearson Prentice Hall, New Jersey; Demirkan, H., (2016) Design Studies Journal, 44, p. 28; Cohen, G.M., (2002) The Essential of Art History, 51p. , Research and Education Association, New York; Hombostel, C., (1991) Material, Types, Uses and Application, 92p. , 2nd edn., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Canada; Wong, W., (1996) Principles of Form and Design, John Wiley & Sons, 44p. , Inc., Canada; Tile, V., (2002) Mosaic Installation, , http://venus-tiles.com/collections/, accessed on March 2016; McCulloch, J., (2010) Design in Black and White, 13p. , Images Publishing, Australia","Nediari, A.; Interior Design Department, Indonesia",,,"American Scientific Publishers",,,,,19366612,,,,"English","Adv.

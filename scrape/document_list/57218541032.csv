The objective of this research is to examine the existing classification of mutual funds database. The data of mutual funds is taken from Bloomberg through Portal Reksadana 2013 which covered 690 mutual funds. The existing classification consists of mutual funds fixed income (reksadana pendapatan tetap), equity (reksadana saham), money market (reksadana pasar uang) and structured (reksadana campuran). The existing financial attributes consists of the net asset value, percentage annualized return the last 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and year-to-date. This paper uses K-means clustering to propose new classification of Indonesian mutual funds. The result reveals that mutual funds in equity and fixed income belong to its group. However, mutual funds money market is belong to mutual fund fixed income and mutual funds structures are identified to mutual funds equity. Furthermore, we find that in average 43% of Indonesian mutual funds are misclassified in accordance with their attributes. Finally, it is suggested to re-group the mutual funds into smaller classification, which has lower rates of misclassified mutual funds and possibility to achieve better performances in terms of its percentage annualized return. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

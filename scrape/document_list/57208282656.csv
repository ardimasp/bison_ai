Self-diagnostic is done from the self-assessment stage to obtain profiling of teachers on the condition of engagement. The next stage is to intervene on the results so that teachers can do the improvement program engagement independently. This research uses exploratory research method as one part of Neuroresearch method. Overall this research produced an application with intervention design that is beneficial for the teacher so that with correct improvement program individually impact to the teacher become more engaged with its profession and ultimately able to improve performance impacting to education quality nationally. © 2018 IEEE.","ITEI Apps; Neuroresearch","Education quality; Exploratory research; Improve performance; Neuroresearch; One parts; Self assessment; Self-diagnostics; Application programs",,,,,"This work is partially supported by Ministry of Research, Technology, Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia (Kemenristekdikti-RI) and The Ministry of Education, Culture of the Republic of Indonesia (Kemendikbud-RI) and National Board Teachers Association of the Republic of Indonesia (PB-PGRI).

Nevertheless there is indication of other benefit of social curiosity that have not yet been explored, namely overcoming the anxiety of death. This indication is based on previous research which found a positive relationship between anxiety and social curiosity. In this study, social curiosity is framed as representation of symbolic immortality, which people use to overcome the terror of death. To support this conjecture, two studies were conducted using the Terror Management Theory (TMT) framework. Study 1 (N = 352, M age = 19.39) found a positive relationship between death anxiety and social curiosity. In Study 2 (N = 507, M age = 20.68) it was found that intolerance of uncertainty and desire for self-verification mediated the relationship between death anxiety and social curiosity. The results of this study indicate that increasing interest in obtaining information about how other people think, feel, or act is a form of mechanism used by people to control anxiety related to death. © 2020 The Author(s)Psychology; Philosophy; Death anxiety; Social curiosity; Intolerance of uncertainty; Desire for self-verification; Terror management theory. © 2020 The Author(s)","Death anxiety; Desire for self-verification; Intolerance of uncertainty; Philosophy; Psychology; Social curiosity; Terror management theory",,,,,"Universitas Indonesia, UI

There were many elements that contributed to a traffic accident. Generally, the accident was caused by the aggression of the motorcyclist himself. The aggression behavior itself was usually correlated to stress, where stress would trigger the aggression behavior. This research was conducted to know how the stress contributed to the aggression. Using Buss Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AO) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), we conducted data collection on 208 motorcyclists in Jakarta. Based on the data tabulation result, it was inferred that stress contributed to motorcyclists aggression amounted to 14.2%. However, stress was not sufficient enough to predict the aggression of motorcyclist, but also the perception of the situation and the coping strategy used would also need to be considered. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

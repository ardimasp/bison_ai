There are two basic objectives for the use, which are first to facilitate and deepen the basic knowledge of polynom spline art principles by understanding the correct use of the polynom spline art formula. The second mastery of this theme is the need to produce a graphical system, which is based on the polynom spline art formula. The use of polynom spline art is a large number in the field of construction of object graphs. This Research takes into account the node K of the B-spline blending function. The method used is based on the polynom spline-art theory. The results to be achieved, namely the model of making objects based on polynom spline Art. In this research using programming language to describe and achieve the goal, that is graph by using simple openGL and make in general and can recordthe structure of good data. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Graphical system; OpenGL; Polynom spline art","Application programming interfaces (API); Blending; Electronic commerce; Graph theory; Blending function; Construction technique; Design modeling; Graphical system; Object graphs; OpenGL; Polynom spline art; Smooth curves; Interpolation",,,,,"Appreciation to the Ministry of Research Technology and Higher Education of Republic of Indonesia, which has provided support to the author through 2018 Research Grants.","Newman, W.M., Sproull, R.F., (1981) Principles of Interactive Computer Graphics, , Kogakusha, McGraw-Hill; David, F., Rogers, Adams, J.A., (1998) Mathematical Elements for Computer Graphics, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Pavlidis, T., (1997) Algorithms for Graphics and Image; Giloi, W.K., (1999) Interactive Computer Graphics, , Prentice Hall, Inc.

Hypothesis testing is one test that is often used to obtain the conclusions of the research conducted. One hypothesis testing that is often used is the testing of hypotheses through ANOVA (Box et al., 1978). However, in determining the validity of a hypothesis is obtained, there are assumptions that must be met, namely the assumption of homogeneity range between treatments (Box et al., 1978; Box and Cox, 1964; Gomez and Gomez, 1984; Guerrero, 1993; Mattjik and Made, 2006). Examination of a wide homogeneity assumption has been made in research involving plants, which use a randomized block design.

The main goal is to help facilitate language learning automata theory. This research describes the system development of the application program, from the creating of automata structures to the implementation of algorithm in the creation and running of automata transformation. The test is conducted by observing the system in dealing with the formation and transformation of finite automata. It is conducted to examine the system's ability to run automata in large state. From the test we obtain that the system is capable of creating automata and performing transformations between finite automata.

Unfortunately, most of musical creations are written in music block notations. This is quite troublesome for Indonesian singers because students are used to use sheet music written in cipher notations or numbered musical notations. Therefore, authors intend to make an application program that can solve this problem. There are many methods which can be used in making the voice-related applications. The method used by author is the Fast Fourier Transform method which will transform digital signals into analog signals. Application program created by author is expected to help singers to master the songs, specially in terms of tone and pitch intervals.","Block notation; Fast fourier transform; Sheet music; Tone","Analog signals; Application programs; Block notation; Digital signals; Fourier transform method; Musical notation; Sheet music; Tone; Computer science; Engineers; Fast Fourier transforms",,,,,,"(2010) How to Visual Studio, , http://ilmukomputer.com/2007/09/10/visual-studio-net-open-source/, Anonim, 16 Juni; (2010) Music Theory, , http://library.thinkquest.org/15413/theory/theory.htm, Anonim, 22 April; Bracewell, R.N., (2000) The Fourier Transform and Its Application, , McGraw-Hill; Brigham, E.O., (1988) The Fast Fourier Transform and Its Application, , Prentice-Hall International, New Jersey; Burns, E.M., (1990) Intervals, Scales, and Tuning, , Academic Press; Mueller, J.P., (1999) Visual Studio 6: The Complete Reference, , Mc-Graw-Hill; Schuler, C., Chugani, M., (2005) Digital Signal Processing: A Hands-On Approach, , McGraw-Hill; Steams, S.D., Hush, D.R., (1990) Digital Signal Analysis, , Prentice-Hall","Gazali, W.; Mathematics Department, , Jakarta, Indonesia; email: wikaria@binus.edu",,"IAENG Society of Artificial Intelligence;IAENG Society of Bioinformatics;IAENG Society of Computer Science;IAENG Society of Data Mining;IAENG Society of Electrical Engineering",,"International MultiConference of Engineers and Computer Scientists 2011, IMECS 2011","16 March 2011 through 18 March 2011","Kowloon",85583,,9789881925121,,,"English","IMECS - Int.

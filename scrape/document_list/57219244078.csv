This study uses quantitative data, using the fuzzy ahp model. The selection of criteria in this new decision-making system is carried out using FGD (Forum Group Discussion) by involving decision-makers within the IT department, to get the right criteria, and also using data from developer performance reports. so that the main criteria are right. The results obtained from the selection of developers using the Fuzzy AHP model show that criteria such as workload, speed, knowledge, and skills are the main criteria in selecting the right developer. The results of this study are developer alternatives that have been ranked based on the new method so that decision-makers can use the data as a basis for selecting developers to work on projects. Fuzzy AHP in the consistency level assessment is carried out at the hierarchical structure level and can accommodate inconsistencies in the assessment. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

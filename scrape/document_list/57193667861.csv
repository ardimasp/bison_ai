The research applied a quantitative method by distributing online questionnaires to 68 freshmen and sophomore students of Bina Nusantara students who took Indonesian language subject on the 2nd semester of 2018-2019 term. Data were analyzed by tabulation and it can be concluded that there are three factors which motivate students in learning Indonesian language. Students consider that there are no obstacles in lack of time during their six class sessions. Students also consider that the new learning model for Indonesian language course is not essentially required. © 2020 ACM.","blended learning; Indonesian language; perception; university students","Education computing; Learning systems; Surveys; Blended learning; Indonesian language learning; Indonesian languages; Learning models; Online questionnaire; Quantitative method; Students",,,,,"Rybinski, K.I., Holzhacker, H., Blended learning can improve student grades-narxoz university's large scale experiment shows (2016) Kazakhstan; Alwasilah, A.C., (2017) Membangun Kreativitas Menulis: Membenahi Pendidikan Bahasa di Perguruan Tinggi, 7 (2), pp. 111-120. , Komposisi: Jurnal Pendidikan Bahasa, Sastra, Dan Seni; Thinking skills for environmental sustainability perspective of new students of biology education department through blended project based learning model (2015) Jurnal Pendidikan IPA Indonesia, 4 (2), pp. 110-119. , Husamah; Hariadi, T., Suwandi, S., Slamet, S.Y.S., The need to develop a fast-track-based bahasa Indonesia learning model in higher education institutions (2018) KnE Social Sciences, 3 (9), pp. 330-336; Kunaefi, T., (2006) ICT in University Teaching/learning and Research in Southeast Asia Countries: Case of Indonesia, , http://www.rihed.seameo.org/uploadfiles/ict/ICT_Indonesia.pdf, Accessed 25 July 2019; Zainuddin, Z., Keumala, C.M., Blended learning method within Indonesian higher education institutions Jurnal Pendidikan Humaniora, 6 (2), pp. 69-77. , (n. d.); Barokati, N., Annas, F., Pengembangan pembelajaran berbasis blended learning pada mata kuliah pemograman komputer (unisda lamongan case study) (2013) Jurnal Sistem Informasi, 4 (5), pp. 352-359; Widodo, H.P., Budi, A.B., Wijayanti, F., Poetry writing 2. 0: Learning to write creatively in blended language learning environment (2016) Electronic Journal of Foreign Language Teaching, 13 (1), pp. 30-48; Shi Wei, Y., Shi, Y., Yang, H.H., Liu, J., Blended learning versus traditional learning: A study on students' learning achievements and academic press (2017) The 2017 International Symposium on Educational Technology (ISET), , Hong Kong, China, 27-29 June 2017; Aslam, S., A comparative study of blended learning versus traditional teaching in middle school science (2017) International Conference on the Future of Education",,,"Osaka University","Association for Computing Machinery","8th International Conference on Information and Education Technology, ICIET 2020","28 March 2020 through 30 March 2020",,160127,,9781450377058,,,"English","ACM Int.

The results show that the diction and sentence deviations become major problem faced by the students. The deviations themselves occur because of language transfer from students' first language to target language.

The research method used is a qualitative method with case study technique. The sample of this research is 32 students of BIPA BINUS of academic year 2017/2018. The results showed that: (1) there was an increase of average learning result of BIPA BINUS students' speaking skill from 68.7 to 76.2 by using CTL learning method; (2) 21 out of 32 BIPA get high rank (istimewa to madya) and 11 low rank (semenjana to terbatas) in their speaking skill outcomes; (3) 22 out of 32 students of BIPA BINUS stated strongly that CTL learning method is motivating, fun, meaningful, and helpful to improve the speaking skill of BIPA students; (4) CTL learning method is done through technique of educational visit, cultural visit, and business visit; (5) education for sustainable development can be done through the application of motivational and student-centered learning methods, one of which is the CTL learning method. CTL learning method has advantages and weaknesses that can be used as input for BIPA teachers as an alternative to be creative in BIPA teaching. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Learning systems; Teaching; Contextual Teaching and Learning; Education for sustainable development; Learning methods; Qualitative method; research methods; Student-centered learning; Students",,,,,"http://kniu.kemdikbud.go.id/sektor/pendidikan/education-for-sustainable-development-esd/, Education for Sustainable Development (ESD); Tarigan, H.G., (2008) Berbicara Sebagai Suatu Keterampilan Berbahasa, , (Bandung: Angkasa); Abidin, Y., (2013) Desain Sistem Pembelajaran Dalam Konteks Kurikulum 2013, , (Bandung: RefikaAditama); Wassid, I., Sunendar, D., (2013) Strategi Pembelajaran Bahasa, , (Bandung: PT Remaja Rosda karya); Johnson, E.B., (2007) Contextual Teaching and Learning: Menjadikan Kegiatan Belajar-mengajar Mengasyikkan Dan Bermakna, , (Bandung: Mizan Learning Center)",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Advance and Scientific Innovation, ICASI 2018","23 April 2018 through 24 April 2018",,148653,17426588,,,,"English","J.

One of the challenges derives from either productive or receptive skills. In accordance with productive skill, this study aims to determine the forms of error in the speaking practice of international students in Bina Nusantara (BINUS) University in 2017-2018 through Online UKBIPA application. In this scope, UKBIPA represents the proficiency test of Indonesian language for international students in BINUS University. The research method is qualitative based-research with content analysis techniques. The data of this study contains the utterance of the practical speaking of international BIPA students transcribed in complete sentences. Based on the analysis of 175 sentences in the form of BIPA students' speech, the results obtained 72 phonological errors (40%), 43 lexical errors (25%), 22 semantic errors (13%), and 38 grammatical errors (22%) in student speech. The results of this study benefits for the development of BIPA materials, especially for speaking skill; the development of BIPA speaking method; development of evaluation tools and speaking tests of BIPA; and refinement of the Online UKBIPA Binus test application. The study concludes that the major error in speaking practice of BIPA appeared in phonological errors. In this sense, the study contributes to the learners and teachers in preparing BIPA learning eventually. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Linguistics errors; Online; Speaking practice; UKBIPA BINUS","E-learning; Errors; Learning systems; Semantics; Speech; Grammatical errors; Indonesian languages; International students; Online; research methods; Speaking practice; Test applications; UKBIPA BINUS; Students",,,,,"Bahri, S., Rasyid, S.F., Fenomena Kedwibahasaan di Sekolah Dasar; Sebuah Kondisi dan Bentuk Kesantunan Berbahasa (2018) Jurnal Bidang Pendidikan Dasar (JBPD), 2 (2), pp. 62-72; Ruriana, P., Nurul, I., Pamungkas, S., (2010) Interferensi Dan Integrasi Bahasa, , https://pusatbahasaalazhar.wordpress.com/hakikat-hakikikemerdekaan/interferensi-dan-integrasi/, Retrieved August 14, 2018, from; Budiarti, A., Interferensi Bahasa Indonesia Ke Dalam Bahasa Inggris Pada Abstrak Jurnal Ilmiah (2013) Bahasa Dan Seni: Jurnal Bahasa, Sastra, Seni, Dan Pengajarannya, 41 (1), pp. 10-17; Yulianto, B., Mintowati, M., (2009) Analisis Kesalahan Berbahasa, , Jakarta: Universitas Terbuka; Wood, J.F., Errors in second/foreign language learning and their interpretations (2017) Education and Linguistics Research, 3 (1), p. 1; Maharani, M., (2012) Efektivitas Pembelajaran Bahasa Indonesia Bagi Penutur Asing Untuk Meningkatkan Keterampilan Menulis, , Unpublished master's thesis).

It serves as the barometer in the Indonesian Studies major that required an effective learning model. The learning model constituted salient indicators addressing to all BIPA students in the university. The concern is in accord with the vision and mission of the university, and competitiveness quality for all students regionally. The research intended to advocate a consenting model in learning BIPA effectively, to achieve the maximum target score, and finally to implement the skills for all students for effective communication. The study involved 60 students in the BIPA program. The model of CLIL is applied in BIPA classes. Moreover, the research pinpointed the framework efficacy and the formulation of deliberate strategy involving the approach, method, and technique. The research intertwined eclectic the students with diverse academic disciplines and cultural aspect. This descriptive research implemented the combination of survey method and action research.

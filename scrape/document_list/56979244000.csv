The current technology development makes the classic games have to adapt by converting the style of play, such as online version of the classic game. N-tier architecture provides a model for software developers to create an application which has a high flexibility and reusability. By dividing the application into some tiers, developers have options to modify or add a particular layer, instead of changing the whole application. The implementation of n-tier can be done by supporting with internet. The combination of Xiang Qi with online game technology based on web is expected to be successful in attracting the attention of gamers/players. The paper presents a re-packaging of conventional games into an online game application which built using n-tier developing approach that can manage accessibility and interactivity of the games. © 2015 The Authors.

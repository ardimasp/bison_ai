The organizations decide to perform digital transformation and move from the traditional approach to the agile approach for anticipating the rapid changes in the current digital era. This research will investigate the impact of digital transformation to the IT governance mechanism in established company using study case methodology. We analyse two companies in Indonesia: banking and telecommunication companies that have adopted agile and DevOps team. For this purpose, a qualitative study using Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and in-depth interview method were conducted. Our findings show that digital transformation brings many challenges in the established organization. This transformation impacted key elements of IT governance: structure, process, and relational mechanism.

However, their business processes are often inefficiently managed, which increase the cost of operation. The current Enterprise Resource Planning system could address the problem, but the price is relatively expensive for current condition of SME in Indonesia. The problem continues when the business operation run in different places, where data inconsistencies reduce operation efficiency. Cloud-based ERP is a possible solution, but it is relatively slow to fully maximize the benefit. Therefore, new affordable solution with remote access, which use less internet bandwidth is needed to answer problems in implementing ERP. This study aims to analyze the problem and use the findings to provide a prototype that could address the existing problem. Through implementation of various technologies such as Single Page Application, Gzip Compression, and Webpack Module Bundler, the author successfully developed the prototype of ERP system. Several tests, including compatibility test and user acceptance test were performed to evaluate the prototype. Although this prototype has not been able cover the whole modules, the test results showed a satisfactory result in terms of accessibility and basic functionality. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","ERP; Single Page Application (SPA); SME; Web Application","Acceptance tests; Competition; Resource allocation; Software prototyping; Testbeds; Cost of operations; Data inconsistencies; Enterprise resource planning systems; Operation efficiencies; Single Page Application (SPA); Small medium enterprise; Various technologies; WEB application; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,,,"Development of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (Smes) and Large Enterprises, , http://www.depkop.go.id/berita-informasi/data-informasi/data-umkm, Ministry of Cooperation and SMEs Republic of Indonesia Online; Handayani, P.W., Hidayanto, A.N., Budi, I., Business process requirements for indonesian small medium enterprises (smes) in implementing enterprise resource planning (erp) and erp systems comparison (2013) Journal of Computers, 8 (9), pp. 2437-2441; Saputro, J.W., Handayani, P.W., Hidayanto, A.N., Budi, I., Roadmap of enterprise resource planning (erp) research for small and medium enterprises (smes) in indonesia (2010) International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems (ICACSIS); Raihana, G.F.H., Cloud ERP-a solution model (2012) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology & Security, 2, pp. 76-79; (2016) Improve Your Understanding of Web Applications, , https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-web-application-3486637, Nations D Online; Shimanorvsky, S., (2015) Multi Page Web Applications Vs Single Page Web Applications, , http://www.eikospartners.com/blog/multi-page-web-applications-vs.-single-page-web-applications, Online; Mikowski, M.S., Powell, J.C., (2013) Single Page Web Applications; Eckerson, W.W., Three tier client/server architectures: Achieving scalability, performance, and efficiency in client/server applications (1995) Open Information Systems, 3, pp. 46-50; Darwin, P.B., Kozlowski, P., (2013) AngularJS Web Application Development; Jain, N., Mangal, P., Mehta, D., AngularJS: A modern mvc framework in javascript (2015) Journal of Global Research in Computer Science, 5, pp. 17-23; About Nodejs, , https://nodejs.org/en/, Online; A Tutorial on Database Concepts, Sql Using Mysql, , http://www.atlasindia.com/sql.htm, Online; Nosql Databases Explained, , https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained, Online; Introduction of Gzip, , http://www.gzip.org/, Online; What Is Webpack, , http://webpack.github.io/docs/what-is-webpack.html, Online; Burger, R., (2016) The Ultimate Guide to Agile Software Development, , http://blog.capterra.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-agile-software-development/, Online","Kosala, R.R.; Computer Science Department, Indonesia; email: rkosala@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Educators and institutions are unsure which digital content is the most appropriate to improve a student’s skills. For this study, an experimental design method using a control-group pretest-posttest was conducted to compare learning outcomes through the implementation of digital content in blended learning for computer programming. The instrument used was a programming case. The factor and level tested included various digital content types, and the desired response was an increment in learning outcomes. This study concludes that there is a significant increment in the average scores of groups that are using Ebooks in blended learning—not video as many educators may think.

In 2014, the travel industry is still the king in the e-commerce industry of Indonesia. But there are some things that hinder Indonesian people using e-commerce. Previous research has subjectively contributed to the design and marketing of the online tourism industry, but no one has done an evaluation directly through user perspective assessment. The absence of a theoretical reference model causes significant ambiguity regarding how to create e-travel sites and evaluates them in practice. In this study, it is proposed and validate an evaluation model of the use of e-commerce in tourism derived from previous research theories linked to the risk theory of the Davis’s Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The results obtained from this research indicate that the interest of users of travel booking applications online is influenced by several factors, namely: technology, environment, behavior, and e-lifestyle. The purpose of this research is to understand which factors influence the intention of using tourism booking applications online. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

A problem often encountered is the difficulty in formalizing and articulating the knowledge, and for this reason, a media is required to extract into an easily translated form. This study focuses on explicit forms of knowledge, and as a result, the method employed is the collection of research findings related to tacit knowledge and community learning. Also, these findings were surveyed based on predetermined keywords and analysed into a complete report which can be used as material for decision making especially in the matter of sharing this knowledge in community-based learning. The purpose of this study was to determine the understanding of measuring this knowledge in terms of existing dimensions, such as technical and cognitive. However, in this case, the conditions and processes help inform about tacit with reference to the Community. The survey activity is still limited to its conceptual measurement and has not yet led to implementation in the form of community learning where members can interact directly using text, images, videos and other forms. In addition to using two dimensions of measurement, knowledge can be shared through socialization, externalization, combination and internalization that refer to the Nonaka and Ba models for learning to provide a sense of fun for the community group. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Community learning; Survey; Tacit knowledge",,,,,,,,"Ozmen, F., (2010) The Capabilities of the Educational Organizations in Making Use of Tacit Knowledge, 9, pp. 1860-1865; Fullan, M., The Role of Leadership in the Promotion of Knowledge Management in Schools, , OECD Conference (18–19 March 2002).

Research mitigates the other research paper and makes a conclusion and a report by PRISMA method. The development of computer technology will support the development of an organization. Considering any factors in choosing the right and suitable high-performance computer resource due to our organization is a must.

There are many health application available on mobile phones. However, the applications available on the market right now are usually only able to do a specific task, such as calorie tracker or fitness tracker or blood pressure tracker. To maintain or improve health and fitness we need to take into account combination of several factors, which require users to use different applications. In this paper, we developed a mobile application that has combined health-relevant features: a calorie tracker to help user loss or maintain weight, blood pressure and pulse tracker, and fitness tracker. These are three essential factors to help user live a healthy life and prevent heart disease. In addition, we also implemented a simple gamification feature to increase users' motivation to use the application and do the exercises. The experimentation and findings showed that the proposed solution would be beneficial to help people keep a healthy heart and go fit. © 2019 IEEE.","Blood Pulse; Calorie Tracker; Gamification; Health Status; Mobile Application; Recommender","Blood; Blood pressure; Cardiology; Gamification; Mobile computing; Heart disease; Infectious disease; Mobile applications; Relevant features; Specific tasks; Diseases",,,,,,,"Rachmi, C.N., Li, M., Baur, L.A., Overweight and obesity in Indonesia: Prevalence and risk factors-a literature review (2017) Public Health, 147, pp. 20-29; Dewanti, W., High prevalence of child obesity in Jakarta sparks concerns The Jakarta Post, , http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/10/16/high-prevalence-childobesity-jakarta-sparks-concerns.html, 16 October 2014, [Accessed 29 Febuary 2016]; Hruby, A., Hu, F.B., (2015) The Epidemiology of Obesity: A Big Picture.

This enhances studies to try to improve services to meet these demands. is one to shape a better experience. development needs to be done in a structured way so that they are integrated and efficiently implement the latest technology to build a digital economy. For this reason, it is necessary to apply good governance in planning for the development of technology-based services, so that the development of smart cities towards digital prosperity can be realised. The most important thing that needs to map out is prioritising services in smart cities development.In this study, we conducted a literature study and observations of ICT implementation in the development of services in Indonesia. Then we do a mapping between services that can shape into a digital economy by referring to digital welfare introduced by Atkinsons.Our results show that the initial program that supports faster productivity growth is an ICT service that makes up smart cities is a priority that must be considered by the central and local governments. © 2019 IEEE.","Digital Economic; Digital Prosperity; Governance; Productivity Growth; Smart City","Information use; Productivity; Development needs; Digital Prosperity; Good governances; Governance; Information and Communication Technologies; Latest technology; Literature studies; Productivity growth; Smart city",,,,,,,"Kulesa, T., A vision of smarter cities: How cities can lead the way into a prosperous and sustainable future 'a vision of smarter cities: How cities can lead the way into a prosperous and sustainable future (2009) Susanne, Thank You for Joining Me Today, pp. 1-6; Visvizi, A., Lytras, M.D., Damiani, E., Mathkour, H., Policy making for smart cities: Innovation and social inclusive economic growth for sustainability (2018) Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management, 9 (2), pp. 126-133; Lopes, N.V., Smart governance: A key factor for smart cities implementation (2017) 2017 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid and Smart Cities, ICSGSC 2017, pp. 277-282; (2016) Cobit-it Governance Framework-Information Assurance Control | Isaca, , http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/cobit/Pages/Overview.aspx, isaca isaca.org.

The absence of a theoretical reference model causes significant ambiguity regarding how to create e-travel sites and evaluates them in practice. In this study, it is proposed and validate an evaluation model of the use of e-commerce in tourism derived from previous research theories linked to the risk theory of the Davis’s Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The results obtained from this research indicate that the interest of users of travel booking applications online is influenced by several factors, namely: technology, environment, behavior, and e-lifestyle. The purpose of this research is to understand which factors influence the intention of using tourism booking applications online. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The focus of this study was HEI in Indonesia, that was the HEI’s National Quality Assurance Standard as a case. To define the component, this study applied a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to clarifying the composition of the EA framework. There were two EA frameworks that had been commonly used in HEI to further analyze the study, which were TOGAF and Zachman. The same process was done to define the HEI governance component. To seek the update education situation in 4.0 era, the exploration search was not just from HEI quality assurance and HEI value chain, but it came also from the future university. As a result, the EA component has seven groups and eight groups of components for HEI. Component between EA and HEI map was used to seek the relationship between components. HEI can use the map as a guideline when deciding to implement EA in their organization. Another result is that there are 16 components that are not directly discussed as Indonesia’s National Quality Assurance Standard. © 2019 ICIC International.","EA framework; Enterprise arhiteture; Higher eduation institution; Institution governanes; Systemati literature review",,,,,,,,"de Vries, M., van Rensburg, A.C.J., Evaluating and refining the “enterprise arhiteture as strategy” approah and artefats (2009) The South African Journal of Industrial Engineering, 20 (1), pp. 31-44; (2018) University of the Future Bringing Education 4.0: Bringing Education to Life; Jairak, K., Praneetpolgrang, P., Applying IT governane balaned soreard and importane-performane analysis for providing IT governane strategy in university (2013) Information Management & Computer Security, 21 (4), pp. 228-249; Llamosa-Villalba, R., Carreño, L.T., Paez, Q.A.M., Delgado, Q.D.J., Barajas, A.B., Sney-Der, E.G., (2015) Enterprise Arhiteture of Olombian Higher Eduation, IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE); (2015) Social CRM in Higher Education: Model, Process, Channel Preference, and Critical Success Factors, , Ph.D. Thesis, University of Indonesia; Oderinde, D.O., (2012) Understanding Enterprise Architecture in Four UK Universities, , Ph.D. Thesis, University of Bolton; Tjong, Y., Adi, S., Kosala, R., Prabowo, H., A systemati mapping study on enterprise arhiteture mining (2018) International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Technology, pp. 403-411; Bokor, J., (2012) University of the Future: A Thousand Year Old Industry on the Usp of Profound Hange, , Ernst and Young; Zandi, F., Tavana, M., A fuzzy group multi-riteria enterprise arhiteture framework seletion model (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39 (1), pp. 1165-1173",,,,"ICIC International",,,,,21852766,,,,"English","ICIC Express Lett Part B Appl.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073316162

In the context of Information Overload, an additional load of information does not always increase benefits to users. In the previous study, a KMS MR framework was designed to address Information Overload. Following that, this research follows through earlier research by experimenting with a case study. The case study involved students working on quizzes that were allowed to open the Internet, open books, and KMS applications with a 30-minute time limit. In this baseline, the research question ushers on the impact of the implementation of the KMS MR framework in the case study and whether to improve the information quality perceived by students. The research method is based on experimental, questionnaires and statistics for processing data and decision making. In addition, this study intends to evince the reliability of the KMS MR framework in overcoming the Information Overload issue. At the end of the study, the results indicated the gap of 1.50 points as the differences in the value of information quality between the two groups of KMS MR and KMS. Per this outcome, the KMS MR framework is capable of improving the information quality and shifting the culmination point of Information Overload. © 2019 ISSN.","Case study; Information overload (IO); KMS MR; Knowledge management system (KMS); MapRe-duce",,,,,,,,"Eppler, M.

Productivity is a demand for improving organizational performance. ERP systems are a way to increase productivity. Therefore, ERP implementation is important to ensure that ERP runs well. Critical factors in ERP implementation must get serious attention to project management. Even so, the reality of ERP implementation is slowly, even tends to experience failure, resulting in highly expensive. The previous research that carried out ERP implementation showed that the failure reached 40%, and the achievement of the benefits of ERP implementation in Indonesia is still not optimal. It can be said that ERP implementation is a complexity project. For this reason, it is necessary to consider other implementation methods that can overcome the problem in implementing ERP. An agile method is a proactive and reactive alternative to handle the problem in implementing of ERP. The development of an agile ERP model is one way to achieve success in ERP implementation. This research methodology is a survey approach to the study of literature. This research will propose an agile ERP model which will be used as an effective guide for achieving the success of ERP implementation. © 2019 IEEE.","agile ERP model; agile method; ERP implementation","Information management;

Crypto-governance is able to use IBM using hyperledger fabric protocol and private blockchain network. Muhammadiyah Tangerang University (UMT) saved the graduate documents storage manually by human resources. Moreover, it would be wasting time for many tasks, for example when staffs searched database, they would consume a lot of time and the graduate documents were vulnerable to damage in the disaster. Based on the problems above it would face the research questions; how did we keep the graduate documents storage secure and how it could be authentic guaranteed? Blockchain technology with distributed ledger and consensus is considered to overcome this problem. There were 5 steps taken in this research starting from discussing, literature review, analyzing, learning blockchain technology, creating system model and making a conclusion. The conclusions of this study were expected that the data of graduate students could find faster, easily and authentic guaranteed. © 2019 IEEE.","blockchain in private university; blockchain technology; crypto-governance; graduate document; private university","Blockchain; Crime; Digital storage; Information management; Critical problems; crypto-governance; Document storage; graduate document; Graduate students; Literature reviews; private university; Research questions; Students",,,,,,,"Bo, X., Tshilidzi, M., (2017) Implication of the Fourth Industrial Age on Higer Education, , 17 Maret; Krishnan, U., Gearing up education towards Industry 4. 0 International Journal of Computers & Technology., 17 (2). , 21-09-2018; Miroslav, M., Slavomir, B., (2016) Mass Customization in the Context of Industry 4. 0: Implications of Variety Induced Complexity, pp. 21-39. , December; Zeynep Meral, T., The possible effects of 4th industrial revolution on Turkish educational system (2018) Eurasian Journal of Educational Research, 77, pp. 163-184; Nancy, G.W., Singapore's Higher Education Systems in the Era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution: Preparing Lifelong Learners, , Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 22 June 2018; Van, T.H., Le Thai Kim, A.M.A., The 4. 0 industrial revolution affecting higher education organizations operation in Vietnam (2017) International Journal of Management Technology, 4 (2), pp. 1-12. , October; Afaf, T., It governance impact on business unit performance (2013) A Thesis in the John Molson School of Business, , Concordia University, Canada.

However, no studies have tested the effects of the adoption of information technology on the performance of surveyors in performing their duties at the Indonesian Commission for Accreditation of Hospitals (KARS). The purpose of research is to test empirically the external factors that influence the adoption of applications for increased surveyors’ works performance as an assessor of hospitals in Indonesia. External factors studied were: (1) the support of top management, (2) self-efficacy, (3) the quality of the system, and (4) training. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is the best way to evaluate the factors that influence the decision of the assessor and the hospital professionals on the acceptance of a system. Through the distribution of questionnaires were processed using SmartPLS, proving that the four external factors studied had a significant influence on the acceptance of information technology. Based on observations also prove that through the use of Information System of Indonesian Commission for Accreditation of Hospitals or SIKARS application, assessor performance is more effective and efficient. So that, through the data and information provided on the application can support all stakeholders in decision-making. SIKARS as national accreditation database can be used as a reference for service quality improvement in Indonesian hospitals. ©BEIESP.","Hospitals accreditation; Information system of indonesian commission for accreditation of hospitals; Technology acceptance model",,,,,,"First Author Diyurman Gea is a senior faculty member at Bina Nusantara University, Jakarta, Indonesia.

To ensure the implementation of information systems in line with institutional objectives, the information system must be managed properly by implementing IT Governance. Educational institutions also have an interest in this matter. To be able to compete with other educational institutions and ensure the quality of the three pillars of education (teaching, research, and community service) can run well, IT management in educational institutions must use the principles of IT Governance. The extent to which universities in Indonesia have implemented IT governance will be discussed in this article.

In this corridor, the growth of digital content in the system seems to have a positive impact on the organization. However, this continued growth is not always beneficial for the organization over time. In this context, the con- dition is renowned as Information Overload (IO) in the system. The research question in the study is to determine the KMS framework to overcome the information overload issue. As this backdrop, the paper provides the KMS framework guidance to overcome IO issues based on the MapReduce approach. In this respect, this study aims to be a useful reference framework for organizations that address IO problems. The method in this study refers to literature studies which collect various references related to KMS and MapReduce algorithm. It directs to the use of in-depth observation to build the frame- work. Ultimately, this study concludes that the production of KMS MapReduce framework has been completed and set prepared for the implementation in a real case.

It is still considered a very important preventive measure of cardiovascular disease as it gives a significant impact to reducing mortality rates and cardiovascular events. Prior to developing a prediction model of cardiovascular risk, identification of dominant predictor variables is very crucial. Some prominent studies have proposed a vast number of predictor variables. Although some predictor variables might be universal in nature, as the premise of this study, some of the variables might be associated with local lifestyle that governs patient behavior. This paper presents a verificative study on previous studies predicting cardiovascular risk level by using Indonesian adult patients’ lab records as the input dataset. In relation to this objective, this study aimed to select dominant biochemical indicators as predictor variables and trained machine learning models as classifier. Finally, this study compared the performance of several prominent classifier models such as: XGBoost, Random Forest, k-NN, Gradient Boosting, Artificial Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron), Decision Tree, and Ada Boost. The results show that: XGBoost model achieved the best training and testing accuracy (0.965 and 0.964) compared to Random Forest (0.964 and 0.962), 5-NN (0.952 and 0.948), Gradient Boosting (0.948 and 0.940), Artificial Neural Networks (0.945 and 0.933), Decision Tree (0.861 and 0.860) and Ada Boost models (0.748 and 0.718). © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cardiovascular risk prediction; Machine learning","Data mining; Database systems; Decision trees; Forecasting; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Biochemical indicators; Cardio-vascular disease; Cardiovascular event; Cardiovascular risk; Machine learning models; Predictor variables; Preventive measures; Training and testing; Machine learning",,,,,,,"Rovio, S.P., Cardiovascular risk factors from childhood and midlife cognitive performance: the Young Finns Study (2017) J.

Nevertheless, because of the lack of literature on the smart IPO framework, we refer to smart government and smart city framework. The aim of this paper is to propose a framework for smart IPO in developing countries in the context of smart city framework. The study found that smart IPO composed of several components such as 1) Smart IPO Model; 2) Smart IPO Enterprise Architecture; 3) Smart IPO Collaboration Model; 4) Smart IPO Development Model; 5) Smart IPO Measurement Model; 6) Smart IPO Standard; and 7) Smart IPO Services. It also found that there are four models of IP office as follows: Model 1 (basic web-based, public services); Model 2 (advanced internal administration); Model 3 (full process automation); and Model 4 (knowledge-based IP services). Moreover, we found also three stages of IP development model: Stage 1 (automation of internal processes); Stage 2 (web-based e-services); Stage 3 (e-dossier, e-filing, e-payment). © 2019 The Authors.","IP office; IT governance; Smart IP office framework","Developing countries; Information use; Knowledge based systems; Patents and inventions; Public administration; Smart city; Websites; Collaboration models; Computer-implemented Inventions; Economic development; Enterprise Architecture; IP office; IT governance; Smart IP office framework; Theoretical framework; Internet protocols",,,,,,,"What is intellectual property?

In this respect, IO research case areas are evolving and varying through the times. In line with this, the researchers undertake IO related studies in a myriad of fields and offer a diverse solution. In regard to the idea, this study aims to summarize the implemented solutions to solve various IO research case areas. The research applied Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method to collecting, analyzing and synthesizing the relevant IO papers. The research consists of eighty-six relevant IO papers and represents six electronic databases. The topnotch solutions in this research are categorized into Information Processing, Application Utilization, and Information Searching. In this sense, the case areas of Education, Organizations and Research Dataset represent the most highlighted research fields. The research contributes to subsequent studies and contemporary state of the art IO references eventually. © 2018, ICIC International.

Currently, education has reached the Education 4.0 stage. Education 4.0 requires technological commitment. Learning processes focus on students, not the teacher as in the previous educational system. Learning processes involve other stakeholders such as the industries, the communities, the experts, or the government. Smart Hybrid Learning Method is a learning method that responds to the Education 4.0 system, which is possible to create collaboration among stakeholders. The purpose of this research is to produce a model of Smart Hybrid Learning Method and architectural framework design of Smart Hybrid Learning System using three-layer architecture approach. The Smart Hybrid Learning Method is the evolution of the flipped or inverted classroom method combined with several other learning method approaches, such as Challenge Based Learning and Case Based Learning. Learning can be done inside and outside the classroom. To apply the Smart Hybrid Learning Method, it needs system called Smart Hybrid Learning System, which can be accessed by several stakeholders.

Therefore, ERP system is important strategy for organization's survival. One of the critical issues that affect a successful ERP implementation is the implementation method. In previous research, it showed that many organizations had faced complexity when they were implementing ERP in order to meet their requirements. In other cases, the ERP systems are unable to provide solution which is a simplicity of the necessary business processes. The ERP implementation complexity is one of the factors that lead the failures. Thus, here, we intend to propose an agile approach to reduce complexity and eventually our intention is to improve ERP implementing to become more successful. In this study, we are employing a systematic literature review (SLR) approach to identify the principles factors of the agile methods for ERP implementation. In result of employing this SLR method, we found that agile values and principles are correlated in ERP implementation complexity. © 2018 IEEE.","agile methods; complexity; ERP implementation; systematic literature review","Agile manufacturing systems; Information management; Agile approaches; Agile methods; Business environments; Business Process; complexity; ERP implementation; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Enterprise resource planning",,,,,,,"Alleman, G.B., Agile project management methods for ERP: How to apply agile processes to complex COTS projects and live to tell about it (2002) Conference on Extreme Programming and Agile Methods, , Springer; Amid, A., Moalagh, M., Ravasan, A.Z., (2012) Identification and classification of ERP critical failure factors in Iranian industries; Ali, M., Miller, L., Erp system implementation in large enterprises-A systematic literature review (2017) Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 30, p. 4; Baig, J.J.A., Shah, A., Sajjad, F., Evaluation of agile methods for quality assurance and quality control in ERP implementation (2017) Intelligent Computing and Information Systems (ICICIS), 2017 Eighth International Conference on, pp. 252-257. , IEEE; Bansal, V., Negi, T., A metric for ERP complexity (2008) International Conference on Business Information Systems, pp. 369-379. , Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg; Baramichai, M., Zimmers, E.W., Jr., Marangos, C.A., Agile supply chain transformation matrix: An integrated tool for creating an agile enterprise.

This research is aimed at exploring the effect of consumer confusion towards purchase intention moderated by omni-channel integration. Inspired by the new concept of omni-channel, this study developed a model of consumer confusion to increase purchase intention. Data was collected from a survey of 442 consumers, and SmartPLS was used as a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) tool to analyse data. As a hypothetical development about omni-channel integration as a part of the e-quality service, this study developed three hypotheses. The results of this study showed that e-WOM has a significant impact on (1) consumer confusion, (2) purchase intention mediated by consumer confusion, and (3) purchase intention mediated by consumer confusion and moderated by quality of omni-channel integration quality. The findings of this study differed from those of previous research.

For public sector, ITG implementation is difficult because it is complex than ITG in the private sector. It is therefore necessary to have ITG mechanisms that align public sector needs especially in creating public value. The literature in ITG implementation in the public sector still does not discuss the ITG mechanisms implementation that align with IT strategy to create public value. Using Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we find key practices in ITG mechanisms that align with IT strategy in the public sector.

Learning Analytics (LA) is needed to collect and analyze learners' activity logs on MOOC and predict their passing potential. The prototype application is developed by using Rational Unified Process (RUP) software development method.

These days, the emerging growth of technology creates an increasing trend for art commissions, as the process can now be done through the Internet rather than physical meetings. Art commissions are often conducted through social media or other general e-commerce web platforms. However, the current solutions are lacking in features which are needed to support the art-commissioning process. One of the problems is the unorganized commission ordering process. As a result, it is difficult to make the art-commissioning process a smooth experience. A feature such as a recommender system can be implemented in a website to improve the art-commissioning process. This paper aims to develop a system that can be used to recommend artwork images based on the combination of features of artwork image, art style category and user-generated tag contents. The recommendation algorithm takes into account a combination of the features content of the image, the category which refers to the art style, and the descriptive tags including similar tags. Our experiments and test on the users suggest that the recommender system worked well in recommending artworks to potential art buyers. © 2017 IEEE.","Content-based filtering; Digital artwork; Image search; Recommender system","Arts computing; Electronic commerce; Search engines; Commissioning process; Content based filtering; Digital artwork; Image search; Ordering process; Recommendation algorithms; Social media; User-generated; Recommender systems",,,,,,,"Read, R., (2015) Hiscox Corporate, , http://www.hiscoxgroup.com/~/media/Files/H/Hiscox/reports/Hiscox%20Online%20Art%20Trade%20Report%202015.pdf; Lubis, M., (2014) Indonesian Consumers Flock Online to Purchase Products and Services, , http://www.nielsen.com/id/en/press-room/2014/indonesian-consumersflock-online-to-purchase-products-and-services.html; Ellen, Web-based digital art commission: Process subsystem (2016) Technical Report, Binus University International; Saputra, M.D., Web-based digital art commission: Structure subsystem (2016) Technical Report, Binus University International; Linyuan, L., Medo, M., Yeung, C.H., Zhang, Y.C., Zhang, Z.K., Zhou, T., Recommender systems (2012) Physics Reports, 519 (1), pp. 1-49; Burke, R., Hybrid recommender systems: Survey and experiments (2002) User Modeling and User-adapted Interaction, 12 (4), pp. 331-370; Balabanovic, M., Shoham, Y., Fab: Content-based, collaborative recommendation (1997) Communications of the ACM, 40 (3), pp. 66-72; Godoy, D., Corbellini, A., Folksonomy based recommender systems: A state of the art review (2016) International Journal of Intelligent Systems, 31 (4), pp. 314-346; Zhang, Z.K., Zhou, T., Zhang, Y.C., Tag-aware recommender systems: A state-of-the-art survey (2011) Journal of Computer Science and Technology, 26 (5), pp. 767-777; Musto, C., Narducci, F., Lops, P., De Gemmis, M., Semeraro, G., Content-based personalization services integrating folksonomies (2009) International Conference on Electronic Commerce and Web Technologies, , September.

Most of IT uses in these schools can be recognized from the technical aspects of IT and factor management determining the success of IT application. There are 149 active private schools of informatics management and computing in Indonesia. However, only 6 (4.03%) of them were institutionally accredited with Grade B. The other 21 schools were institutionally accredited with Grade C (14.09%) and none obtained Grade A. Schools of informatics management and computing are holders of most study programs of computing and IT. The measurement of IT performance was conducted based on the aims on the use of IT, process performance, and IT outcomes. The result would be used to determine IT performance of schools of informatics management and computing. Therefore, the aims were on this aspect related to IT knowledge, IT strategy, IT alignment and IT innovation. This research used a causal-explanatory method. This research applied a mixed method (quantitative and qualitative method). It was based on the previous relevant studies on the relationships among these variables. It developed the conceptual framework and hypotheses showing these relationships.

To reach more of the target market, game developers need to maintain good performance while still delivering high quality graphical effects. Game developers want to use the most efficient ways to render game graphics, specifically particle systems, one of the most resource intensive elements in a game. Geometry shader is a new technology that was proposed to offer the right capability in rendering particle systems. The aim of this paper is to find out whether geometry shader is more efficient to render particle systems by analyzing the performance differences and resource consumption between rendering particle systems using a CPU and geometry shader. These research experiments support the power of a GPU-based geometry shader approach to render particle systems compared to the CPU rendering of particle systems. Geometry shader is shown to be effective and provides sufficient benefits for optimizing the geometry generations. However, the benefits of the geometry shader approach diminish when the particle size increases and the screen resolution gets higher. © 2016 IEEE.","game visual elements; geometry shader; GPU rendering; graphics rendering; particle system","Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Geometry; Graphics processing unit; Human computer interaction; Particle size; Geometry shader; GPU rendering; Graphics rendering; Particle systems; Visual elements; Rendering (computer graphics)",,,,,,,"Blythe, D., Rise of the Graphics Processor (2008) Proceedings of the IEEE, 96 (5), pp. 761-778; Zhang, Y., Qu, P., Cihang, J., Zheng, W., A Cloud Gaming System Based on User-Level Virtualization and its Resource Scheduling (2016) IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 27 (5), pp. 1239-1252; Diard, F., Using the Geometry Shader for Compact and Variable-Length GPU Feedback (2007) GPU Gems, 3, pp. 891-907. , Addison-Wesley; Zink, J., Pettineo, M., Hoxley, J., (2016) Practical Rendering and Computation with Direct3D 11, , CRC Press; Shreiner, D., Sellers, G., Kessenich, J., Licea-Kane, B., (2013) OpenGL Programming Guide: The Official Guide to Learning OpenGL, Version 4.3, , Addison-Wesley; Petersson, S., Particle System Rendering: The Effect on Rendering Speed when Using Geometry Shaders (2007) The Department of Interaction and System Design Blekinge Institute of Technology, , Thesis; Reeves, W.T., Particle Systems - A Technique for Modeling a Class of Fuzzy Objects (1983) Computer Graphics, 17 (3), pp. 359-376; Owen, G.S., Particle Systems (2000) ACM SIGGRAPH Education Committee, , https://www.siggraph.org/education/materials/HyperGraph/animation/particle.htm; Blythe, D., The Direct3d 10 System (2006) ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 25 (3). , ACM; Cebenoyan, C., Graphics Pipeline Performance (2004) GPU Gems: Programming Techniques, Tips and Tricks for Real-Time Graphics, , R.

E-government facilitates the provision of relevant government information in electronic form to the citizens promptly; better services for the citizen; the citizen development through information access without bureaucracy; the increasing productivity and cost saving in doing business with supplier and customer from government; and participation of public policy in decision-making. E-governance refers to how a manager and supervisor utilize IT and Internet to execute their function in supervision, planning, organization, coordination, and employee effectively. Principle of IT Governance in the digital era must not be separated from the good information technology governance. Information technology has been entered in business strategy of government, so the decision-making and the supervision have become an important agenda that discussed in the meeting of high officials in the government. Nowadays, there are many cases of digital asset misuse, one way to prevent it is to implement IT good Governance in government. © 2016 IEEE.","Digital Era; E-Government; IT Governance","Decision making; Digital devices; Information management; Business strategy; Digital era; E-governments; Government information; Government institutions; Information access; Information technology governance; IT governance; Government data processing",,,,,,,"Ahmad, B.S., Studi Kesiapan Pemanfaatan Teknologi Informasi dan Komunikasi serta Implementasi e-government dengan Kerangka Kerja Cobit (2011) Jurnal Buletin Pos Dan Telekomunikasi, 9 (1). , Maret; (2006) ITGI Governance Report, , http//www.itgi.org, ITGI,[cited; Available from:; Sharma, S.K., An E-government services framework, encyclopedia of commerce, e-government and mobile commerce (2006) Mehdi Khosrow-Pour, Information ResourcesManagement Association, Idea Group Reference, USA, pp. 373-378; Tata kelola dan organisasi teknologi informasi dan komunikasi (2008) Peraturan Gubernur Pemerintah Provinsi Daerah Khusus Ibukota, , Jakarta Nomor 16 Tahun 2008 Tanggal 18 Februari; Jakli, J., Štemberger, M.I., Towards t-Government by increasing process maturity in public sector (2009) Handbook of Research on ICT-Enabled Transformational Government: A Global Perspective, IGI Global, pp. 15-34. , Dwivedi, Y.K., Janssen, M. and Weerakkody, V.

Previous studies were tested that the omni-channel integration quality can improve customer satisfaction. As a novelty, we introduced omni-channel integration as a moderating variable that influence consumer confusion to the intention of purchase. This paper constituted a hypothetical development about the proposed omni-channel integration as a part of the e-quality service. This proposed research aimed to explore the effect of consumer confusion towards purchase intention moderated by omni-channel integration. In addition, this study discussed about the antecedent of consumer confusion to the intention of purchase, namely e-WOM. Three hypotheses were modeled in this research proposal. The future results of this research were expected to be a significant contribution towards business, science, and society. © 2016 IEEE.","consumer confusion; electronic word of mouth; omni-channel integration quality; purchase intention","Customer satisfaction; Information management; Integration; Purchasing; consumer confusion; Development plans; Electronic word of mouths; Purchase intention; Quality services; Research proposals; Sales",,,,,,,"(2015) B2C E-commerce Sales in Indonesia from 2011 to 2016, , http//www.statista.com/statistics/280925/b2c-ecommerce-sales-in-indonesia/, Statista; (2015) Profil Pengguna Internet Indonesia 2014, , APJII,rfsti Jakarta: Puskakom UI; Nielsen, (2014) E-commerce: Evolution or Revolution in the Fast-moving Consumer Goods World; (2015) Mobile Commercce Growing Fast in Asia Pacific with Half of Smartphone Uses Now Shopping in Their Device, , Mastercard; (2015) State of Mobile Commerce: Apps and Cross-device Lead Mobile Business, , Criteo; Stelzer, J., New insights into the ever-evolving consumer (2014) IBM Commerce Blog, , https//www.ibm.com/blogs/commerce/2014/11/new-insights-everevolving-consumer/, November 5; (2014) Online Shopper Study IDEA Roundtable, , Google; (2014) Customer Desires Vs .

MOOC (Massive Open Online Course), a web-based LMS providing online courses, is a new popular learning media expected to facilitate better teaching-learning process for improving learning outcomes. Unfortunately, most of the current MOOCs are intended only for non-vocational (non-practical) learning and have set aside research on MOOC for computer programming courses. This study employed systematic literature review (SLR) method to summarize and review available functionalities as the core in designing a proposed MOOC architecture model. The proposed model covers application layers (user, system, and data layers) and adopts the theories of cognitive, constructive, and social situated learning. The proposed model is expected to provide guidance for institutions to develop their own MOOC and utilize it in blended learning processes to improve the outcome in computer programming courses. © 2016 IEEE.","architecture model; blended learning; learning outcome; massive open online course; MOOC; programming","Computer architecture; Computer programming; Curricula; Education; Information management; Mathematical programming; Teaching; Architecture modeling; Blended learning; Learning outcome; Massive open online course; MOOC; E-learning",,,,,,,"Ibrahim, R., Jaafar, A., Using educational games in learning introductory programming: A pilot study on students' perceptions (2010) 2010 Int.

From many perspectives particularly for educational, it is interesting to examine how social media can contribute to the learning process. This channel can support an interactive process that occurs when a group of learners collaborates with other to combine their knowledge into new insights. This research focuses on identifying social learning factors framework that enable higher education to be sustainable and be more adaptive. It also depicts conceptual social learning ontology according to Zachman Framework for enhancing collaboration and increasing responsiveness by leveraging social media channel in higher education. The objective of this study is to support classification scheme for descriptive representations of the social learning model. That is not only doing the design artifacts, but it depicts all supportive components to the organizational perspective. This set of view appears to be universal of the subject or object being described, including what (data), how (function), where (network), who (people), when (time), and why (motivation). The primary method of this study is systematic literature review process to define social learning factors that can be mapped into Zachman Framework. The result of this research is conceptual of ontology model for social learning that can be implemented for higher education. © 2016 IEEE.","Ontology; Social learning; Web 2.0; Zachman Framework","Information management; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Classification scheme; Interactive process; Learning process; Organizational perspectives; Social learning; Systematic literature review; Web 2.0; Zachman framework; Ontology",,,,,,,"Elkaseh, A.M., Wong, K.W., Fung, C.C., Perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of social media for e-learning in libyan higher education: A structural equation modeling analysis (2015) Int.

And, if needed, multiple applications may work with same SQLite database, optionally, using filesystem sharing services. However, file sharing option is not always available and reliable in certain conditions. In this paper, we propose a server for SQLite database. This server will be using HTTP as communication protocol. To enable multiuser application, this server will be multithreaded. However, access to the database file will be synchronized to help prevent database corruption. And, as data-interchange format, JSON will be used. We also run several tests to make sure that proposed server is usable.

Trust is very important in e-commerce. The nature of online shopping has a greater uncertainty than offline shopping. Seeing as there is an uncertainty that can produce risks, a prospective buyer's trust is needed. A lot of people's unwillingness to shop online is caused by their lack of trust toward e-commerce. E-commerce is said to be one of the ways for SME to compete with bigger companies. However, building trust requires immense time and cost. SME with limited resources may experience difficulties in building trust just with their own resources. Base on literature research that needs to be validated in next research, we found that trust can be built through trust transfer from the reputable and well-known trust-mark issuer, and third party protection such as escrow account service and credit card issuer. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Commerce; Account services; Literature researches; Online shopping; Primary objective; Prospective buyers; Small medium enterprise; Third parties; Trust transfer; Electronic commerce",,,,,,,"(2014), Google (Jakarta) Online Shopper Study : IDEA Roundtable; (2013) Trust Marks Report 2013 : ""can i Trust the Trust Mark?"", , The European Consumer Centres'Network; (2015) Profil Pengguna Internet Indonesia 2014, , Asosiasi Penyelenggara Jasa Internet Indonesia and Puskakom UI (Jakarta: Pertama); Li, X., Rong, G., Thatcher, J.B., DO we trust the technology?

In finance literature, deciding to pay dividends is a controversial subject. Thus, there are several theories on the reason why companies choose to pay dividends. This paper investigates the likelihood of dividend payment from public companies in Indonesia using some artificial intelligence and statistical techniques. In the process, the possibility of using dividend related data from public companies as a dataset for predictive techniques is analysed. Then domain expert knowledge is used from finance literature to determine the predictor variables. Next predictive models are developed for the likelihood of using dividend payments by applying four different methods: logistic regression, artificial neural networks, decision tree induction, and support vector machines. Afterwards, the predictive accuracy performance of the models generated by these methods is examined. Finally, the resulting decision tree model is analysed and the validity of the resulting predictive model is confirmed with a domain expert. Then the resulting model is converted to create simple and understandable if-then rules, which can be used by company management to make decisions on dividend payments in practice. These if-then rules support the lifecycle theory of dividends as exhibited in previous works.

The study of Knowledge Management System (KMS) issues are based on Systematic Literature Review (SLR). It aims to analyze the state of the art, identify current popular issues on KMS, and offer directions for future research agenda. The methodology used in this paper is based on the systematic literature review to collect, synthesize and analyze numerous papers on a variety of topics that are closely related to knowledge management system issues that published in the last two decades. Based on fifty-four papers reviewed from six electronic databases, the result of this paper obtained fourteen current issues on knowledge management system. Moreover, the top three popular issues consist of the development of capabilities and features of KMS, Big Data issues on KMS, and adoption to new technology issue for KMS respectively. The conclusion of this study emphasized the big data phenomenon as the most contemporary topic for the future research area besides the growing of required KMS capabilities and features development. © 2017 The Authors.

As implemented in the cloud, Web IDE (WIDE) can be accessed online through browsers and on mobile devices. WIDE takes many advantages and becomes popular in recently years. Unfortunately, there is no tool found yet in currently WIDE to support translating novice programmers' algorithm into programming language before they become experts in techniques of writing computer programs. This study goal is to design a tool to support novice programmers' early learning of programming before they step into coding, compiling, running, and debugging in WIDE. Software development method used in this study is Rational Unified Process (RUP). Conclusion of this study is block-code tool can help novice programmers to learn programming language in early phase, and motivate them better. © 2017 The Authors.

The result of a survey that we conducted shows that users were longing for a higher performing search engine with a holistic view of the search results. This work is aimed to elevate the effectiveness of web searching results by incorporating visual and social representation into the results. We have designed and developed a social and integrated search interface that utilizes three-dimensional image renderer to deal with the above issues. Social search results are incorporated with the basic search engine results, while giving users the capability of navigating and visualize through the search results using the three-dimensional image renderer. We tested the system by administering a survey to measure users' experience and satisfaction. It can be concluded from the result of the survey that in general the users were happy with how the search interface works, including the social media search results and the three-dimensional visualization. The system was able to enhance the users' experience when searching for some general topics by having a better visualization. © 2015 The Authors.

However since this technology is still new, there are still many potentials in the game development area that are not explored yet. This paper tries to uncover the potential of integrating physics frameworks with WebGL technology in a game engine for developing 2D or 3D games. Specifically we integrated three open source physics frameworks: Bullet, Cannon, and JigLib into a WebGL-based game engine. Using experiment, we assessed these frameworks in terms of their correctness or accuracy, performance, completeness and compatibility. The results show that it is possible to integrate open source physics frameworks into a WebGLbased game engine, and Bullet is the best physics framework to be integrated into the WebGL-based game engine. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,,,"Schultheiss, D., (2007) Long-term Motivations to Play MMOGs: A Longitudinal Study on Motivations, Experience and Behavior, p. 344. , DiGRA; (2010) Web Browser Plugin Market Share / Global Usage, , Statowl.com,.

We have conducted three types of test to measure the performance of cloud server compared to conventional dedicated server. The first test is to measure the download speed of each server. The second test is to see the possibility of remotely accessing both servers via a Virtual Network Computing (VNC) application. The third test is to deploy a Ragnarok Online game in both servers, from which a group of users will play the game. The first test result showed that although the dedicated server had a bigger bandwidth, the download speed from the cloud server was faster. The second test result showed a failure in establishing the remote access connection since the local Internet Service Provider blocked the VNC package to the cloud server in North America. The third test result shows that the online game was more responsive if deployed in the Cloud server due to traffic flexibility and faster access to the mirror system. We conclude that cloud computing is very promising to be used as a game platform, even for game that does not use the full power of the cloud computing. © 2014 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Bandwidth test; Cloud computing; Games platform; Ragnarok server",,,,,,,,"(2010) Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), Video Game Industry Statistics, , http://www.esrb.org/about/video-game-industry-statistics.jsp, [Online]; Jurgelionis, A., Fechteler, P., Eisert, P., (2009) International Journal of Computer Games Technology, , 2009, doi: 10.1155/2009/231863; Gerling, K.M., Klauser, M., Niesenhaus, J., (2011) Measuring the Impact of Game Controllers on Player Experience in FPS Games, , In MindTrek 2011, Tampere, Finland; Monaco, A., A View Inside the Cloud (2012) The Institute IEEE, p. 8; Mell, P., Grance, T., (2011) The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing, , http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-145/SP800-145.pdf, National Institute of Science and Technology [Online]; Del Conte, N., (2006) SaaS Experts Predict 20 Percent Growth, , http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2020388,00.asp, PC Magazine [Online]; Nae, V., Prodan, R., Iosup, A., Massively multiplayer online game hosting on cloud resources (2011) Cloud Computing, Principles and Paradigms, , edited by R.

This research focuses on the time series data of some individual stocks from the Indonesian Stock Exchange as well as the index data. The financial forecasting agent implemented is based on a Multilayer Neural Network trained with the Genetic Algorithm. An incrementally trained Naïve Bayesian classifier to classify the news stories automatically is also implemented. The agent is measured for its performance on the specified historical stock price data. The first testing surveys its performance against the benchmark agents in a range of stocks. Although the agent does not consistently outperform the benchmarks, it does have its own advantages in terms of stability. The second test tries to find out whether news improves the agent's prediction accuracy. We find that in certain stocks and the index, the inclusion of news does improve the prediction accuracy. © 2011 IEEE.","financial forecasting; news classification; web agent","Bayesian classifier; Financial forecasting; news classification; Prediction accuracy; Stock exchange; Stock price; Time-series data; web agent; Finance; Knowledge based systems; Multilayer neural networks; Research; Time series; User interfaces; World Wide Web; Forecasting",,,,,,,"Mishkin, F.S., Eakins, S.G., (2006) Financial Markets and Institutions, , 5th ed.

Although numerous evaluations on GPS-based system in taxi service have been implemented in many countries, little has been said on the implementation of the taxi dispatch system based on positioning system such as MDT in Indonesia. The general objective of this research is to assess: (i) perceived benefit of existing MDT system, (ii) usage level of existing MDT system, and (iii) driver loyalty on using MDT. The particular objective of this research is to consider the importance of knowledge on existing MDT functionalities. The result of this research is expected to give contribution to improve service quality of taxi service delivery, particularly in the Blue Bird Taxi. © 2010 IEEE.","GPS-based system; MDT","GPS-based system; Indonesia; MDT; Passenger satisfaction; Passenger waiting time; Perceived benefits; Positioning system; Service Quality; System implementation; Taxi dispatch system; Taxi services; Time reduction; Usage level; Data transfer; Global positioning system; Motor transportation; Navigation systems; Research; Telecommunication; Taxicabs",,,,,,,"Bachtiar, E., (2010) Blue Bird: Memulai Dengan Baik, , http://ekonomi.kompasiana.com/2010/01/08/memulai-dengan-baik/[, [Online] Available: June 1; Sholihin, B., (2010) Dunia Selebar Telapak Tangan, , http://majalah.tempointeraktif.com/id/arsip/2004/10/25/TI/mbm.20041025.

We have done some experiments using a testbed program to measure the performance, memory usage and hard disk space used by the two animation models. Our experiment results suggest that the skeletal model has major advantages over the keyframe model, both in terms of the FPS (frame per second) and the memory load.

Matrix code itself is a 2-dimensional barcode that appears to be a 2D image that consists of usually black and white dots that can be printed or displayed on a screen. CQR Code is an extended version of the popular QR Code. 3D barcodes contains data not only in its x and y axis, but also in depth. By stacking QR Codes we can create a new barcode system that can store more data than other existing barcode systems. Through this barcode system, we can embed data that normally could not be done using existing barcode systems. From the tests that had been conducted, currently the CQR Code is capable of storing data up to 9KB with 3 layers and 8 colors. The CQR Code can be read with 40% - 100% chance of success using a multi-format mobile phone barcode reader prototype. We have also implemented a simple color correction algorithm into the barcode reader to ensure its accuracy. In conclusion, CQR Code has the potential for future developments for it to be a simple, sophisticated, and easy to use barcode system that can store relatively large amounts of data.

However, creating game-based application is not easy, laborious, and requires good knowledge of the technology and programming skill. A typical game development process might take months or years to complete. In order to improve the usage of game technology, certain methods and tools have been invented, and the most popular one is game engine. However, learning to use game engine is not simple and takes time. Moreover, we still need programming skills and technical knowledge to use the game engine. This paper focuses on building a games authoring tool that can flexibly work with the existing game engines. We propose a novel plug-in architecture so that the authoring tool can use existing game engines. The advantage of this independent authoring system is that whenever one of the systems became obsolete, the developer can replace it without changing the whole system structure. In the experiments with the prototype system, the usage of the authoring tool shows significant process reduction compared to programming it manually. Furthermore, test on the users shows that the authoring tool can help non-technical users to develop 3D games easily.","Authoring tool; Game development; Game engine; User interface","Authoring systems; Authoring tool; Game development; Game engine; Game technologies; Non-technical users; Plug-ins; Process reductions; Programming skills; Prototype system; System structures; Computer software; Human computer interaction; IPTV; Software design; Technology; User interfaces; Animation",,,,,,,"(2007) Intel Glossary, , http://www.intel.com/products/glossary/body.htm, Game Engine, November Available: [Accessed November 14, 2007]; Eberly, D., (2005) 3D Game Engine Architecture, , United States of America: Morgan Kaufmann; (2007), http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net, SourceForge.net, October Available: [Accessed November 14, 2007]; (2007) Linux Filesystem Hierarchy, , http://tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/glossary.html, GUI, November Available: [Accessed November 15, 2007]; The 3D Game Makers Features, , http://t3dgm.thegamecreators.com/?f=features, Available: [Accessed August 31, 2007]; 3D Game Studio Features, , http://www.conitec.net/english/gstudio/3dgs7.htm, 3D Game Studio, Available: [Accessed August 31, 2007]; Unity3D Features, , http://unity3d.com/features/easy.html, Available: [Accessed August 31, 2007]; Dodge, B.J., George, M., Lessons Learned from the San Diego Microworlds Project (1997) Sixth Annual German-American Dialog, pp. 12-14","Kosala, R.; School of Computer Science, Jl.

Much of the previous work on IE from structured documents, such as HTML or XML, uses learning techniques that are based on strings, such as finite automata induction. These methods do not exploit the tree structure of the documents. A natural way to do this is to induce tree automata, which are like finite state automata but parse trees instead of strings. In this work, we explore induction of k-testable ranked tree automata from a small set of annotated examples. We describe three variants which differ in the way they generalize the inferred automaton. Experimental results on a set of benchmark data sets show that our approach compares favorably to string-based approaches. However, the quality of the extraction is still suboptimal. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

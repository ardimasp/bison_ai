Usually, patients come to hospitals or clinics to have their vitiligo conditions assessed. This can be very tiring to the patients, as vitiligo treatments usually take a relatively long period of time, which can range from months to years. To address this challenge, we present in this paper a prototype of an Android-based mobile application called Vi-DA, which stands for Vitiligo Diagnostic Assistance. Vi-DA consists of three subsystems, which are user sign-up subsystem, camera and image analysis subsystem, and progress report subsystem. The mobile application was developed in Java programming language and uses MySQL as the database system. Vi-DA adopts a vitiligo segmentation algorithm to segment input image into normal skin area, vitiligo skin area, and non-skin area. Results showed that Vi-DA gave comparable results to the previous system implemented in Matlab. User acceptance testing results also showed that all respondents agreed on the usefulness of the system and agreed to use Vi-DA again in the future. Vi-DA benefits both dermatologists and patients as not only a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tool but also as a smart application that can be used for self-assessment at home. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Acceptance tests; Computer aided diagnosis; Dermatology; Image segmentation; MATLAB; Medical computing; Mobile computing; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Mobile applications; Progress report; Segmentation algorithms; Self assessment; Skin disorders; Smart applications; User acceptance testing; Computer systems programming",,,,,"(2017) What Is Vitiligo?, , http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Vitiligo/vitiligo_ff.asp, National Institute of Arthritis Musculoskeletal Skin Diseases [Online]; Kochmann, M., Locatis, C., Telemedicine in the Apple App Store: An Exploratory Study of Teledermatology Apps (2016) Proc. of the Int.

Games with the right presentation can train the brain as a whole. This research is focused on High-Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) in order to be able to train the brain's ability in players. This was made so that the implementation problems in disadvantaged, frontier and outermost areas could be overcome. © 2019 IEEE.","CBL; Game; GDLC; HOTS; Neuroresearch","Brain; High order thinking skills; Engineering education",,,,,"Udjaja, Y., Guizot, V.S., Chandra, N., Gamification for elementary mathematics learning in Indonesia (2018) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 8 (5), p. 3859; Wibisono, W., Yulianto, L., Perancangan game edukasi untuk media pembelajaran pada sekolah menengah pertama persatuan guru republik Indonesia gondang kecamatan nawangan kabupaten pacitan (2012) Speed-Sentra Penelitian Engineering Dan Edukasi, 2 (2); Udjaja, Y., Gamification assisted language learning for Japanese language using expert point cloud recognizer (2018) International Journal of Computer Games Technology, 2018; Kristiadi, D.P., Udjaja, Y., Supangat, B., Prameswara, R.Y., Warnars, H.L.H.S., Heryadi, Y., Kusakunniran, W., The effect of ui, ux and gx on video games (2017) 2017 Ieee International Conference on Cybernetics and Computational Intelligence (CyberneticsCom, pp. 158-163. , November)., IEEE; Sasmoko Harsono, J., Udjaja, Y., Indrianti, Y., Moniaga, J., The effect of game experience from counter-strike: Global offensive (2019) 2019 International Conference of Artificial Intelligence and Information Technology (ICAIIT, pp. 374-378; Sasmoko, H.S.A., Indrianti, Y., Udjaja, Y., Moniaga, J., Makalew, B.A., The repercussions of game multiplayer online battle arena (2019) 2019 International Conference of Artificial Intelligence and Information Technology (ICAIIT)., pp. 443-447; Price, F., Kadi-Hanifi, K., E-motivation the role of popular technology in student motivation and retention (2011) Research in Post-Compulsory Education, 16 (2), pp. 173-187; Yan, F., Udjaja, Y., Sari, A.C., A gamification interactive typing for primary school visually impaired children in Indonesia (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 116, pp. 638-644; Schell, J., (2008) The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses/by Jesse Schell; Koster, R., (2013) Theory of Fun for Game Design., , ""O'Reilly Media, Inc; Bergeron, B., (2006) Developing Serious Games (Game Development Series)., , Charles River Media, Inc; Susi, T., Johannesson, M., Backlund, P., Serious games 1 an overview (2009) 2017 Ieee 8th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference, 2017 (2018), p. 488191. , UEMCON, Janua; Gollnick, D.M., Chinn, P.C., (2013) Multicultural Education in a Pluralistic Society., , Pearson Higher Ed; Alwasilah, S., Karyono, (2009) Etnopedagogi, , Bandung: PT.Kiblat Buku Utama; Kartadinata, S., (2010) Etnopedagogik: Sebuah Resureksi Ilmu Pendidikan (Pedagogik)., , Bandung: Pascasarjana UPI Bandung; Klara, K., Baktiyar, O., Sandygul, K., Raikhan, U., Gulzhiyan, J., Ethnic pedagogy as an integrative, developing branch of pedagogy (2015) Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences, 6 (1 S1), p. 612; Dennis, A., Wixom, B.H., Roth, R.M., (2015) System Analysis and Design, 6; Johnson, L.F., Smith, R.S., Smythe, J.T., Varon, R.K., (2009) Challenge-based Learning: An Approach for Our Time, pp. 1-38. , The New Media Consortium; Udjaja, Y., Steven, R., Tanuwijaya, K., Wairooy, I.K., The use of role playing game for Japanese language learning (2019) Procedia Computer Science, 157, pp. 298-305; Fios, F., Sasmoko Gea, A.A., Neuro-research method: A synthesis between hermeneutics and positivism (2016) Advanced Science Letters, 22 (9), pp. 2202-2206; Sasmoko, I.Y., Widhoyoko, S.A., Udjaja, Y., Tanurwijaya, A., Teacher engagement interventions through itei apps (2018) 2018 6th International Conference on Cyber and It Service Management (CITSM, pp. 1-4. , August., IEEE; Sasmoko Indrianti, Y., Widhoyoko, S.A., Udjaja, Y., Rosyidi, U., Performance change with or without itei apps (2018) 2018 6th International Conference on Cyber and It Service Management (CITSM, pp. 1-4. , August)., IEEE; Akmal, A., Local culture and morality attachment to tpack framework of pre-service english teachers within the chalenge of the 21st century skills (2017) International Journal of Education, 9 (2), pp. 113-119; Udjaja, Y., Android application for detection of skin cancer using expert system (2018) Social Economics and Ecology International Journal, 2 (1); Aulia, A., Udjaja, Y., Wairooy, I.K., Hutama, A.P., Shabira, D.K., Muhtadin, S., Android application to detect cat disease using an expert system (2019) Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems Journal, 4 (5), pp. 158-162",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2019 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Education, TALE 2019","8 April 2019 through 11 April 2019",,164144,,9781728126654,,,"English","TALE - IEEE Int.

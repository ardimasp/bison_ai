The e-voucher is used as a flight ticket payment instead of cash payment to buy a ticket. The e-voucher consists of some attributes such as destination, flown date, and flight class. Particularly, a marketing manager needs to review the utilization of e-voucher when a ticket has been approved in every year. The proposed solution is to redeploy existing OLTP database into data warehouse. The data warehouse already developed using nine-step Kimball’s methodology. All data will be analyzed using OLAP to present a report in a visual form such as dashboard. Furthermore, airlines company can produce an analysis report using business intelligence. © IAEME Publication","Business Intelligence; Data Warehouse; ETL; Pentaho System; Reporting",,,,,,"Al-Debei, M.M., Data warehouse as a backbone for business intelligence: Issues and challenges (2011) European Journal of Economics, Finance and Administrative Sciences, 33; Watson, H.J., BI-based Organizations (2010) Business Intelligence Journal, 15 (2); Xiao, B., Cheng, G., (2015) The Research Of Teradata Data Warehouse Technology, , IEEE; Parra, V.M., Mohammad, A., Syed, A., Halgamuge, M.N., Pentaho and Jaspersoft: A comparative study of business intelligence open source tools processing big data to evaluate performances (2016) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 7 (10); Chung, P.-T., Chung, S.H., (2013) On Data Integration and Data Mining for Developing Business Intelligence, , IEEE; Tarnaveanu, D., Pentaho Business Analytics: A business intelligence open source alternative (2012) Database Systems Journal, 3 (3). , III,. 2012,. 3; Tutunea, M.F., Rus, R.V., Business intelligence solutions for SME's (2012) International Conference Emerging Markets Queries in Finance and Business, , Romania; Data warehousing as a healthcare business solution (1998) Healthcare Financial Management: Journal of The Healthcare Financial Management Association, 52 (2), pp. 56-59. , S.

Several factors have been found and determined potentially capable to stimulate dropouts. Many researchers have been applied data mining methods to analyze, predict dropout students and also optimize finding dropout variables in advance. The main objective of this study is to find the best modeling solution in identifying dropout student predictors from 17432 student data of a private university in Jakarta. We also analyze and measure the correlation between demographic indicators and academic performance to predict student dropout using three single classifiers, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB) and Decision Tree (DT). We found indicators such as student’s attendance, homework-grade, mid-test grade, and finals-test grade, total credit, GPA, student's area, parent's income, parent’s education level, gender and age as student’s dropout predictors. The results only get 64.29 (NB), 64.84% (DT), and 75.27%(KNN) while we tried to combine algorithms with Ensemble Classifier Methods using Gradient Boosting as meta-classifier and gets better about 79.12%. In addition, we also get the best accuracy of about 98.82% using this method which was tested by 10-fold cross-validation. © 2019 ASTES Publishers.

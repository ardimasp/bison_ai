Businesses are also utilizing this very rapid increase in internet technology. They sell products and services through the internet with various attractive offers and competing with each other to increase their sales. One strategy that can be done to get more sales is through the method of personalizing services for customers. The personalization aspect in e-tourism has been predicted to increase. Customers who are making valuable data at every stage of their journey are making a challenge for travel companies to collect and link these data points to improve their customer experience. Learning the customer behaviour can be very significant for Online Travel Agent. Because collecting millions of search results through their services and provide a smart travel experience, Online Travel Agent in Indonesia must use Big Data and Cloud technology alignment to win the competition in the market. The entire data lifecycle must be simple because of the needs of users to keep batch ingesting a lot of data likes once in an hour. Streaming analytics has grown over the past few years, it has become one of the most critical components of most of the businesses.

Modern Education in Indonesia is encountering a complex situation for higher education. The complex ecosystem intended to deliver learning material and develop potential talent to become expertise. We proposed the SOA system architecture which create a new ecosystem based on SOA. It will give student and other stakeholders have interconnected learning systems. We proposed SOA system architecture and SOA system reference for interconnected modern higher education in Indonesia. Its purpose is being interconnection between students, lecturers/instructors, universities, financial institutions, fund institutions, and employers/industries. In the end, we should be able to create powerful tools that have seamlessly connected platform which offers a valuable service.

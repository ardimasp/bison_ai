The study is based on phenomenal conditions where Online Social Networks have become a popular trend among Indonesian young generation, particularly young females. Indonesian young females have extravagantly used Online Social Networks as a platform for sharing information, demonstrate self-identity, and sustaining relationship. This condition also occurs in university context, where female students are often found busy working with Online Social Networks through their mobile phone. Based on those reasons, this study seeks to indicate factors indicate that Indonesian young females are so addicted to Online Social Networks usages. In addition, this recent study also figures out kinds of information regularly shared on Online Social Networks (OSNs) profiles. To obtain the findings, this study involved fifteen young female students from Mass Communication major as the respondents of the study. The data were gathered through semi-structured questionnaire distributed to the fifteen female students of Mass Communication. The results reveal that four major factors were leading these young females become addicted to Online Social Networks as Line, WhatsApp, and Facebook. Those factors were number of OSN groups joined, time-spent using OSNs, number of friends in OSNs, and medias for accessing OSNs. Furthermore, the findings also declare that pictures, videos, and real names were top listed information shared by online through the social networks. By the end of the study, it is suggested that educators and parents should highly concern on the negative implications of young females? addictive behavior. For further research this study recommends to conduct a similar study to different gender as male students in order to investigate their major causes of addiction to Online Social Networks. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",,"Students; Addictive behaviors; Information shared; Mass communication; On-line social networks; Online social networks (OSNs); Sharing information; Undergraduate students; University context; Social networking (online)",,,,,,"Leea, L., Chena, D., Lia, J., Lin, T., Understanding new media literacy: The development of a measuring instrument (2015) Computers and Education, 85, pp. 84-93; DeAndrea, D., Ellison, N.B., LaRose, R., Steinfield, C., Fiore, A., Serious social media: On the use of social media for improving students? adjustment to college (2011) Internet and Higher Education, 15 (1), pp. 15-23; Al-Sharqi, L., Hashim, K., Kutbi, L., Perceptions of social media impact on students? social behavior: A comparison between Arts and Science students (2015) International Journal of Education and Social Science, 2 (4), pp. 122-131. , http://www.ijessnet.com/?s=Al-sharqi, , Apr.2015; Nguyen, H., Indonesia is the fastest growing country for internet use - Report (2017) Rappler News Forum, , https://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asiapacific/indonesia/bahasa/englishedition/159593-internetsocial-media-statistics, Jan.2017; Lenhart, A., Madden, M., Smith, A., Internet adoption over time by teens and adults (2011) Pew Research Center Report, , http://www.pewinternet.org/2011/11/09/part-1-teens-andsocial-networks/, Nov, 2011; (2016) Indonesia, Facebook Remains The Most Popular Site, , https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Indonesia-FacebookRemains-Most-Popular-Social-Site/1014126, Jakpat Research.

This study envisages the positive values of accommodating Social Media Sites (SMSs) in teaching practices according to the professional educators. Thirty professional educators, i.e. the lecturers, from two universities (i.e. Multimedia Nusantara University and Bina Nusantara University) has participated in this study. The data was collected from the survey by means of questionnaires, analysed using percentages, and exposed the results descriptively. The findings reflected that the positive values of accommodating Social Media Sites in teaching practices were to develop social skills and improve academic skills. However among the two values, the latter was highly influencing the professional educators because of the four reasons: enabling to do tutorial lessons, providing online discussion space with experts or guest lecturers, assisting in doing peer-review and peer-editing, and enhancing the receptive skills, the productive skills, and also the critical thinking skills of the users in SMSs, especially the professional educators or lecturers. Thus, accommodating Social Media Sites (SMSs) in teaching practices is essential for professional educators in Indonesia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Education; Professional aspects; Robotics; Surveys; Teaching; Critical thinking skills; Educational institutions; Online discussions; Peer review; Positive value; Social media; Social skills; Teaching practices; Social networking (online)",,,,,,"Manca, S., Ranieri, M., Is is a tool suitable for learning?

One of the difficult parts is grasping the attention of audiences during the critical situations, such as in the early morning or after the lunch break. At the situations, students are not paying more attention to any speeches or presentations occurred in the classroom because of some lapses of attention span such as poor listening, yawns, blurred visual images, and noisy situations. For that reasons, the study seeks to investigate the most preferred SCREAM Rhetorical devices used by male and female students when doing persuasive presentation and verify whether gender differences play a role in the way the male and female students exploited SCREAM Rhetorical devices to persuade the audiences. To explore the application of SCREAM Rhetorical devices, this study involved sixteen English Business Presentation students; eight males and eight females who were randomly selected to record the business presentation in video as multimedia learning device. Then, the presentations through the videos were analyzed using Windingland (2012) SCREAM taxonomy that comprises Rhetorical devices into six types: Simile, Contrast, Rhyme, Echo, Alliteration, and Metaphor. The significant findings proved that the presentations displayed on the videos showed that all respondents executed SCREAM Rhetorical devices. The gender differences influenced the SCREAM rhetorical devices used. Interestingly, of six devices, Echo is the most preferred device exploited in the students' persuasive presentation. © 2017 IEEE.","Gender; Persuasive presentation; SCREAM rhetorical devices; Video presentation","Education; Social sciences; Business presentations; Gender; Multi-media learning; Persuasive presentations; SCREAM rhetorical devices; Undergraduate students; University students; Video presentations; Students",,,,,,"Jones, P.A., 21 Rhetorical devices explained (2016) Mental Floss, pp. 1-3. , http://mentalfloss.com/article/60234/21-rhetoricaldevicesexplained, Nov; Hamm, P.H., (2006) Teaching and Persuasive Communication, , USA: Brown University; Jensen, K., (2010) Persuasive Presentations, , Massachusetts: Acanthus Publishing; Windingland, D., (2012) Rhetorical Devices: SCREAM to Give your Presentation Power, pp. 1-3. , www.virtualspeechcoach.com/.../rhetoricaldevice, VirtualSpeachCoach.Com, Feb; Labov, W., (1966) The Social Stratification of English in New York City, , Washington, D.C. : Center for Applied Linguistics; Trudgill, P., Sex, covert prestige and linguistic changes in the urban british english of norwich (1972) Language in Society, 1, pp. 179-195; Holmes, J., (1995) Women, Men and Language, , London: Longman; Mayer, R.E., (2001) Multimedia Learning, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; (2004) Television Goes to School: the Impact of Video on Student Learning in Formal Education, , http://www.cpb.org/stations/reports/tvgoestoschool/, Corporation for Public Broadcasting; Jesse, S.D., Billig, S.H., Creating a WEB of evidence of student performance in a technology-rich learning environment (2002) International Journal of E-learning, 1, pp. 33-34; Traynor, O., Effects of computer-assisted-instruction on different learners (2003) Journal of Instructional Psychology, 30, pp. 137-143; Brown, J.D., (2001) Using Surveys in Language Programs, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press",,,"BK21 Plus Project, University of Ulsan;University of Ulsan","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","10th International Conference on Human System Interactions, HSI 2017","17 July 2017 through 19 July 2017",,129837,,9781509046881,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

One of the big problems is that getting students’ attention. Since students are huge in numbers, it is not easy to gain the students’ focus of the lesson. The purpose of this study is to describe the challenges and best practices used by Collaborative Teaching (co-teaching) lecturers in gaining students’ attention in immense size classes. There were two Bina Nusantara university lecturers involved in this study. The research method of this study is a descriptive qualitative that scrutinized the findings through self-surveys using interviews and classroom observations. The results of the analysis show that Collaborative Teaching (Co-Teaching) could not be performed well in the immense sizeclasses. One striking factor leading to the ineffectiveness of Collaborative Teaching (Co-teaching) was the big number of students about 200–600 each class that results in an uncontrolled condition of retaining students’ attention. To deal with the obstacles, Co-teaching lecturers reformed the course content performance by using creative demonstration i.e., videos and games, and also developed conducive learning environment by giving proper reward and punishment. Thus, findings of the study will contribute positively to classroom management since it will supply positive and constructive apprehensions for lecturers encountered managing large class problems. Likewise, students of the large classes would understand the lesson better. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Attention-Getting; Collaborative teaching (Co-Teaching); Immense classes",,,,,,,"Dieker, L., (2006) The Co-Teaching Lesson Plan Book, , The University of Kansas, Kansas; Eastwood, J.D., Frischen, A., Fenske, M.J., Smilek, D., (2012) Perspectives on Psychological Science, 7, p. 482; Bocanegra, B.R., Zeelenberg, R., (2009) Emotion, 9, p. 865; Forsyth, D.R., (2003) The Professor’s Guide to Teaching: Psychological Principles and Practices: American Psycological Association, , Washington, D.C; Kaplan, M., (2016) Eutopia, p. 2016; Lamba, S., (2014) IOSR Journal of Nursing and Health Science, p. 1; Peres, J., (2015) Taking the Doors off the Classroom Trough Collaboration, , http://www.hotchalkeducationnetwork.com/collaboration-withpurpose, February 21, 2016; Wei, F.-Y.F., Wang, Y.K., Klausner, M., (2012) Communication Education, 61, p. 185","Luke, J.Y.; Language Center, Kemanggisan Ilir III No.45 Palmerah, Indonesia",,,"American Scientific Publishers",,,,,19366612,,,,"English","Adv.

There were 10 (ten) immensely apprehensive students who took part in this study. All of the students were similar in terms of level of English, intermediate, TOEFL Scores above 500, and joined the same program called BINUS Pre-Univ English Programs. The research method of this study is a descriptive qualitative that scrutinized the findings through surveys using simplified version of Daly Miller (1984) Writing Apprehension Test and Farrah (2011) Writing in Group Test. The results of analysis shows that majority immensely apprehensive students examined liked to adopt Collaborative Group Writing (CGW) to accomplish writing assignments, particularly essays. At the same time, the findings of the study prove Collaborative Group Writing was effective to help immensely apprehensive students reducing the evaluation apprehension the students encountered with during completion of essays. Findings of the study also contribute positively in English Language Learning situations where students may vary in terms of knowledge of writing process. English lecturers may also take benefit of Collaborative group writing as a proper method for motivating students to like writing activities. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

For some countries illegal settlements, slum areas, urbanisation, internal migration and employment dislocation exacerbate these problems. A common urban disaster that occurs in many Asian and Pacific countries is flooding, especially during the rainy season. Floods in Jakarta affect vulnerable communities situated on the riverbank of the Ciliwung River. Temporary shelters have been used in response, but they have not answered the needs of these communities. While many studies argue that socio-economic factors are significant contributors to community resilience, this study found that cultural and historical connections, 'connecting to place', was a significant factor that helps people survive and adapt. As such, relocating communities to safer locations is not always the answer and may contribute to other problems. This study supports designs for temporary shelters and facilities following flood disasters through community-led design processes that meet the needs of communities without disconnection from place, temporarily or permanently. © AJEM Australian Journal of Emergency Management, 2017.",,"article; disaster; flooding; human; river; socioeconomics",,,,,"Chilmy, V., Widyawati, K., Perkembangan Pola Permukiman Masyarakat Kampung Melayu (2013) Faktor Exacta, 6 (2), pp. 87-98; Cronin, V., Guthrie, P., (2013) Community-led resettlement: From a flood-affected slum to a new society in Pune, pp. 58-74. , India, Beyond Shelter after Disaster: Practice, Process and Possibilities, Routledge, London and New York; de Boer, J., Definition and Classification of Disasters: Introduction of a Disaster Severity Scale (1990) Journal of Emergency Medicine, 8, pp. 591-595; de Boer, J., (2016) Risk, resilience and the fragile city, Urban disaster resilience, New dimensions from international practice in the built environment, pp. 76-86. , Routledge, New York and London; Fathy, H., (1979) Architecture for the Poor: An Experiment in Rural Egypt, , (Paperback ed.)

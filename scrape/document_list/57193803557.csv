Web usage mining consists of three phases: data preprocessing, pattern discovery, and pattern analysis. In pattern discovery phase, we propose to use classification technique with k-nearest neighbor algorithm implemented with standardized Euclidean distance to classifying frequent access pattern. The result shows that the k-nearest neighbor algorithm can be implemented in web usage mining and can help company to find interesting knowledge in web server log. © 2016 IEEE.","classification technique; k-nearest neighbor classification; web usage mining","Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Pattern recognition; Web crawler; Classification technique; Data preprocessing; Euclidean distance; Frequent access patterns; K nearest neighbor algorithm; K-nearest neighbor classification; Pattern discovery; Web usage mining; Data mining",,,,,"Dhawan, S., Goel, S., Web usage mining: Finding usage patterns from web logs (2013) AIJRSTEM, pp. 203-207; Imandoust, S.B., Bolandraftar, M., Application of K-nearest neighbor (KNN) approach for predicting economic events: Theoretical background (2013) Int.

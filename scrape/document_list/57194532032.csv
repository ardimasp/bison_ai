At this time, the market has been populated with many mobile apps with similar capabilities, making the competition extremely stringent. The purpose of this research is to obtain a more profound understanding regarding the features of the apps that influence the customers in using the online food delivery services. Thus, the results are of importance for businesses and developers. The results should provide a recommendation for the design and effectiveness of the app. The theoretical framework of the study is established by literature reviews of several existing models. In general, those sources focused on five main attribute factors in the apps, namely, Visual Design, Information Design, Navigation Design, Collaboration Design, and Service Level. Data are collected by using a questionnaire and obtained from a sample of 401 respondents. The data are analyzed by a multivariate linear regression model using SPSS software. The results suggest that those factors are equally important in influencing the Conversion Rate of the customers. © 2020 ICIC International.

The lesson learnt can be captured through the formulation of strategy that needed to consider internal and external aspects. For example, as in the digital world, customer experience as well as customer satisfaction. Capability on the side of the network owned combined with network and social capabilities are expected to create distinctive organizational capability. Based on this background, the study aims to examine the effects of customer experience and distinctive organizational capability on the business model innovations of telecommunication firms in Indonesia using quantitative research. The target population are 445 telecommunication network companies in Indonesia which includes 312 ISP firms, 34 satellite firms, 27 tower firms, and 72 Telkom subsidiaries and affiliates, with samples taken from 34 firms. PLS is used as the analytical tool to process the data in this study. The results of the study show that customer experience and distinctive organizational capabilities have an influence to business model innovations. Customer experience has a bigger role than distinctive organizational capability in building business model innovation. These findings have practical implications for the management of telecommunications industries in Indonesia as the development of vocational training rely on the needs of business model innovation development, which directly based on the development of customer experience and supported with development of distinctive organizational capability. Further research can be explored by expanding the sample, industry and in other countries. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.","Business model innovation; Customer experience; Distinctive organization capability; Telecommunication industry",,,,,,,,"Abdelkafi, N., Makhotin, S., Posselt, T., Business Model Innovations for Electric Mobility — What Can Be Learned from Existing Business Model Patterns?

The authors seek to examine the technological impact as part of digital transformation antecedents of CX and OA in developing DSI. The study also aims to investigate the digital transformation model to attain a more sustainableICT performance in Indonesia. The novelty of this study lies in the identifying and testing the concurrent effects of studied variables in improving the understanding of DSI and SP as part of the Indonesian ICT digital transformation model. The study used a sample of 195 Indonesia ICT firms. The finding from PLS-SEM reveals that GIS has a significant moderating role in accelerating the development ofDSI on the relationship with CX and OA, while SP is positively and significantly influenced by CS, OA and DSI. The implication and the proposed of digital transformation model for Indonesian ICT firms is also discussed in this paper. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Information services;

It was supported by the strength of existing firms, which is corporate reputation. The concept of co-creation-innovation itself is based on the theory of service dominant (S-D) logic. Past studies have focused on the critical elements of co-creation (CC) and digital service innovation (DSI), as well as corporate reputation (CR) in shaping a sustainable performance (SP). However, the study of co-creation-innovation and CR and its relationship to green environment has not been intensively explored. This study has aim to oversee the role of Green Information System (GIS; Green IS) in the development of corporate reputation and co-creation-innovation in order to attain sustainable performance. The study was conducted using a sample size of 195 respondents representing Indonesian telecommunication firms. Smart PLS was used as the statistical tool for analyses. Findings demonstrate that green IS directly and indirectly has a significant relationship on corporate reputation, CC and DSI. However, CR has a direct impact on CC but no direct impact on DSI. The limitations and implications of the current study and recommendations for future study is also discussed in this paper. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Information systems; Information use; Statistical mechanics; Corporate reputations; Critical elements; Digital service innovations; Green environments; Green information systems; Service-dominant (S-D) logic; Sustainable performance; Telecommunication firm; Information services",,,,,,,"Lusch, R.F., Nambisan, S., Service innovation: A service-dominant logic perspecive (2015) MIS Quarterly, 39 (1), pp. 155-175; Vargo, S.L., Lusch, R.F., (2014) The Service-Dominant Logic of Marketing, pp. 21-46; Barrett, M., Davidson, E., Prabhu, J., Vargo, S.L., Service innovation in the digital age: Key contributions and future directions (2015) MIS Quarterly, 39 (1), pp. 135-154; Vargo, S.L., Lusch, R.F., Service-dominant logic: Continuing the evolution (2008) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 36 (1), pp. 1-10; Walsh, G., Mitchell, V.W., Jackson, P.R., Beatty, S.E., Examining the antecedents and consequences of corporate reputation: A customer perspective (2009) British Journal of Management, 20 (2), pp. 187-203; Blaschke, M., Haki, K.M., Riss, U.V., Winter, R., Aier, S., (2016) Digital Infrastructure: A Service-dominant Logic Perspective Association for Information Systems; Grönroos, C., Value co-creation in service logic: A critical analysis (2011) Marketing Theory, 11 (3), pp. 279-301; Shrivastava, P., Effect of Co-creation on Customer Experience, Trust and Brand Loyalty (2016) International Journal of Sales & Marketing Management Research and Development, 6, p. 1; Sjödin, C., Kristensson, P., Customers' experiences of co-creation during service innovation (2012) International Journal of Quality and Service Sciences, 4 (2), pp. 189-204; Dean, A.M., Griffin, M., Kulczynski, A., Applying service logic to education: The co-creation experience and value outcomes (2016) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 224, pp. 325-331; Galvagno, M., Dalli, D., Theory of value co-creation: A systematic literature review (2014) Managing Service Quality, 24 (6), pp. 643-683; Payne, A.F., Storbacka, K., Frow, P., Managing the co-creation of value (2008) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 36 (1), pp. 83-96; Sebhatu, S.P., (2010) Corporate Social Responsibility for Sustainable Service Dominant Logic; Iglesias, O., Markovic, S., Bagherzadeh, M., Singh, J.J., Co-creation: A key link between corporate social responsibility, customer trust, and customer loyalty (2018) Journal of Business Ethics, pp. 1-16; Ciasullo, M.V., Troisi, O., Cosimato, S., How Digital Platforms Can Trigger Cultural Value Co-Creation?-A Proposed Model (2018) Journal of Service Science and Management, 11 (2), p. 161; Stevens, E., Boucher, R., Designing Co-Creation Platforms (2016) In Istec, pp. 1-11; Martínez, P., Del Bosque, I.R., Sustainability dimensions: A source to enhance corporate reputation (2014) Corporate Reputation Review, 17 (4), pp. 239-253; Das, K., Gryseels, M., Sudhir, P., Tan, K.T., (2016) Unlocking Indonesia's Digital Opportunity; Chandler, J.D., Lusch, R.F., Service systems: A broadened framework and research agenda on value propositions, engagement, and service experience (2015) Journal of Service Research, 18 (1), pp. 6-22; Zhang, Y., How Smart, Connected Products Are Transforming Companies (2015) Blog.

A quantitative survey was conducted with 500 'middle managers' in indonesia in 2016. The questionnaire utilized a simple random sampling method, and the hypotheses were tested through an sem analysis. The results showed that transactional and transformational leadership styles affect the organization's performance, especially for financial performance. However, transformational leadership will be more effective if it is built through successful strategy implementation rather than done directly to support financial performance. By building links between the leadership style and financial performance, an organization will know the effects of leadership style on their employee performance, while the transactional leadership used to give an immediate effect on the financial and transformational leadership will have negative effects if it is applied directly to drive the financial performance. The findings suggest that to have an immediate result on a company, transactional leadership is the best leadership style. However, to be successful in leading change, transformational leadership should be applied. Moreover, a leader should have both leadership styles and know when to use each. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt. Ltd.

It empirically shows how the driving strategy, such as the braking distance, affects gasoline usage. The movement of vehicles in this work is computed by using the car-following model of the optimal velocity model. For the case of vehicles in a platoon, the model is implemented in an agent-based model. From the dynamic vehicle data, we estimate the fuel consumption by a regression model. We analyze cases involving one, two, and twenty vehicles moving in a platoon for various driving strategies. The result shows that strong braking on high vehicle speed leads to a surge in fuel consumption. The efficient driving condition can be maintained at various speeds given the braking distance is adjusted proportionally with speed. © 2020 ICIC International.","Agent-based modeling; Fuel consumption; Optimal velocity function; Optimal velocity model",,,,,,,,"Fontana, G., Galloni, E., Variable valve timing for fuel economy improvement in a small sparkignition engine (2009) Applied Energy, 86 (1), pp. 96-105; Bhoopalam, A.

It was conducted among 67 companies in the financial industry listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange. The research was conducted using a cross-sectional study with a questionnaire to obtain a response from top management, during the period of May to November 2016. Multivariate analysis was done to test the hypothesis, using Structural Equation Modelling based on variance or Partial Least Square (PLS). In the research, it was found that implementation of corporate governance had a negative impact on competitive advantage, but had a positive effect on financial performance. Application of E-Business had a positive impact on financial performance, while the application of innovation had a positive effect on competitive advantage and financial performance.

Digital technology has become an enabler in the innovation of business models. New capabilities are required to be developed, especially for incumbent firms, since new entries have more agility in establishing new business models to create value. Even though the incumbent firms have strong reputation, they need to develop new distinct capabilities to create value in the long run. The fastest way to develop new capabilities is through collaboration also known as co-creation. Co-creation is a form of economic strategy to bring mutual values from different parties as a mediating role in creating business model innovations. Since there are limited study on co-creation strategy in relation to corporate reputation and business model innovation, this paper aims to assess the mediating role of co-creation strategy on the relationship between business model innovation and corporate reputation. The unit of analysis is taken from Indonesian telecommunication firms with sample of 35 firms out of 445 firms using purposive sampling method. Smart PLS (Partial Least Square) is used as the analytical approach and solution in the study. Research results reveal that corporate reputation has an indirect effect on business model innovation, but a direct effect on co-creation strategy. Co-creation strategy also plays significant effect to business model innovation. Co-creation strategy is a moderator variable between business model innovation and corporate reputation. The paper provided insight that the enhancement of corporate reputation should be directed towards building co-creation strategy which will then help strengthen business model innovation article. © 2019, Penerbit UTHM.

Sustainable values through co-creation involve crucial stakeholders, especially customers, organizations, and social communities to maximise the captured total value. Past studies have explored the concept, system and role of those stakeholders, however the sustainability of co-creation in the digital era has not been covered. Therefore, this paper aims to provide an understanding of the key concepts and models that would support practitioners in building sustainable innovation-driven digital co-creation. The study was conducted using 195 samples representing Indonesian ICT firms. Findings demonstrate that digital co-creation plays a significant role as an intervening variable in the relationship between customer experience orientation, social community, and organization agility and transformational performance. ©BEIESP.","Customer experience orientation; Digital co-creation; Organizational agility; Social community; Sustainability",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, MHE&SR

Hence, this paper examines the roles of digital leadership in developing strategic alliance and dynamic capability based on the market orientation. It is put forward that digital leadership behaviors have a stronger influence on the development of strategic alliance in order to drive dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. A quantitative method was used, comprising 88 senior leaders of Indonesian telecommunication companies. Purposive sampling method was used with the Smart PLS statistical tool. The findings confirm the direct and indirect significant effects between digital leadership and the development of strategic alliance and dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. The study has practical implications to take priority in developing digital leadership to enforce the transformation. The limitations of the study are identified to be the sample, time and statistical tool used, hence longitudinal study is suggested in the future with a more extended sample quantity and time frame. © 2019, Czestochowa University of Technology.

The collaboration with customers is also known as co-creation strategy and predominantly drives transformational performance. Transformational performance is based on performance management theory and transformation paradigms. However, its development to ensure the works of co-creation strategy, based on customer experience, remains unclear. To address this gap the digital transformational model based on co-creation strategy, with a focus on customer experience, was investigated to accelerate transformational performance. This study uses quantitative research, with a sample of 35 representatives from telecommunication firms. The findings demonstrate that co-creation strategy significantly supports customer experience, in driving transformational performance. Customer experience also appears to significantly impact co-creation strategy indirectly. The findings have theoretical implications for the emergence of collaboration strategy in the disruptive era. They show practitioners how co-creation strategy is becoming key in sustaining the business, as it shifts the focus onto the development of customer experience to drive transformational performance. Suggestions for future research are also included in the study. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Co-creation strategy; Customer experience; Transformational performance",,,,,,,,"Bolton, R.N., Gustafsson, A., McColl-Kennedy, J., Sirianni, N.J., Tse, D.K., Small details that make big differences: A radical approach to consumption experience as a firm's differentiating strategy (2014) Journal of Service Management, 25 (2), pp. 253-274; Brochado, A., Troilo, M., Shah, A., Airbnb customer experience: Evidence of convergence across three countries (2017) Annals of Tourism Research, 63, pp. 210-212; Cave, D., Digital Islands: How the Pacific's ICT Revolution is Transforming the Region (2012) Lowy Institute Analyses, pp. 1-24. , https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/155343/cave_digital_islands_web.pdf; D'Aveni, R.A., Gunther, R., (1994) Hypercompetition: Managing the Dynamics of Strategic Maneuvering, , (1st ed.).

Hence, the purpose of this paper is to examine what are the roles of digital leadership in developing strategic alliance and dynamic capability based on market orientation. We argue that digital leadership behaviors have a stronger influence on the development of strategic alliance to drive dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. A quantitative method is used comprising 88 senior leaders of Indonesian telecommunication. The purposive sampling methods is used with the statistical tool is Smart PLS. The findings confirm the significant influence directly and indirectly between digital leadership and the development of strategic alliance and dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. The study has practical implication to take the priority in developing of digital leadership in enforcing the transformation. the limitations of study could be identified as the sample, time and used statistical tools, hence the further study can be extended in term of sample quantity, time horizon to become longitudinal research. © 2019, Dorma Journals.

In doing so, the authors seek to examine the technological antecedents of customer experience (CUE) by examining the role of green information systems (GIS) and service innovation (SEI). Moreover, the study also aims to investigate the association of SEI and GIS with customer satisfaction (CUS) and hotels environmental performance (ENP). The novelty of the present study lies in identifying and testing the joint effects of the studied variables in improving the understanding of CUS and ENP in an existing complex environment. The results of PLS-SEM confirm that customer experience and ENP have a positive and significantly influenced by the GIS. Moreover, the results further suggested that customer experience and CUS have significantly and positively impacted by SEI. Finally, the results of PLS-SEM confirm that ENP and CUS have significantly and positively impacted by customer experience in multinational firms in Indonesia. © 2019, Econjournals.

The Indonesian market is unique in terms of its ICT infrastructure, but still left behind compared to other countries. However, the market has tremendous opportunities in terms of digital capability innovations. The strategic management outline used as a framework for this paper. Mediating variables were co-creation strategies and business innovations with distinctive organisational capability as an internal factor and consumer orientation as the external independent factor. The construct of co-creation strategy and transformational performance were discussed. This model of digital transformation was a suitable model for senior leaders to transform digital business capability and academics. Moreover, the model and construct of variable can be used to further develop the theory of digital transformation.

In addition to that moderating role of mutual trust is also examined. The study has broached the argument that knowledge sharing and transformational leadership style improves team performance. Findings of the current study suggest creativity is a process that starts in the team through the sharing of knowledge. The currents study is also of the view that the that the process of creativity starts in the situation when the team members share knowledge through coordination and it is also argued that the much of the knowledge is shared when team members meet to share knowledge in a given area, much of which is tacit. Sharing such tacit knowledge creates a flow of novel ideas that contribute to successful outcomes, such as new products, processes and patents. The findings of the study have shown agreement with the proposed or hypothesize results. The study has used PLS-SEM to analyses the data.

However, several literatures had acknowledged that this condition was the result of an abnormal internal condition, where firms competed not to engage in competitive selling activities but rather as an effort to maintain performance. This paper was written and prepared as part of a recent study in the Indonesian lighting industry, where many players in the industry considered themselves caught in a severe price war condition. Based on a qualitative survey using open-ended interviews of seven lighting companies in Indonesia, the study found that the industry regard price wars as the result of severe intra-brand competition and an effort to maintain the “status quo” of continuous growth. Propositions to ease friction in price were suggested: exploration to other market segments; exploiting information to induce loyalty; understanding rivalry through capacity size; and management of short-term performance constraints. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Internal firm condition; Lighting industry; Price Wars",,,,,,,,"Barney, J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Composite Materials, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Bhattacharya, R.R., (1999) Short-Run Constraints and Price Wars, , Sydney, Australia; Bungert, M., (2003) Termination of Price Wars: A Signaling Approach, , Wiesbaden: Deutscher Universitäts-Verlag; Busse, M., Firm financial condition and airline price wars (2000) The RAND Journal of Economics, 33 (2), pp. 298-318; Caves, R.E., Porter, M.E., From entry barriers to mobility barriers: Conjectural decisions and contrived deterrence to new competition (1977) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 91 (2), pp. 241-261; Ciriminna, R., Albanese, L., Meneguzzo, F., Pagliaro, M., LED street lighting: A looking ahead perspective (2015) Green, 5 (1-6), pp. 83-94; Deneckere, R., Kovenock, D., Price leadership (1992) The Review of Economic Studies, 59 (1), pp. 143-162; Deneckere, R., Kovenock, D., Lee, R., A model of price leadership based on consumer loyalty (1992) The Journal of Industrial Economics, 40 (2), pp. 147-156; Diallo, M.F., Coutelle-Brillet, P., Riviere, A., Zielke, S., How do price perceptions of different brand types affect shopping value and store loyalty?

The split incentive problem identified in Indonesia shows that the currently designed program of incentives is still problematic for both providers and customers. This suggests that there are multiple alternatives to the incentives that are more suitable to assist in energy-efficiency implementation. Using case studies on retrofit financing for LED lamps in Indonesia, this study aimed to test the validity of those issues, which involved the process of energy decision-making within an organization. Triangulating the findings from case studies and questionnaire surveys, recommendations for future researchers, practitioners, and the government were made. The results indicated that retrofit financing in Indonesia is feasible. Financial metrics such as the analysis of discounted payback period, IRR, and NPV were used to further validate the result. The study also identified that the provider can use Game Theory as a tool to analyze the costs and benefits of retrofit business decisions to tackle the split incentive problems. These findings could lead to improvement in strategies in considering the effectiveness of a firm’s policy measures for delivering energy efficiency in the future. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","ESA & ESPC; Game theory; LCC; Retrofit; Split incentive problem",,,,,,,,"Allcott, H., Greenstone, M., Is there an energy efficiency gap?

To support this transformation, strong digital leader is important to assure the development of this transformation. The study on the role of digital leadership on business model innovation and customer experience has not been explored, significantly, Hence, this research aims at assessing the role of digital leadership, whether it directly or indirectly influences the customer experience orientation in developing business model innovation. This study was conducted through survey to 88 senior leader respondents from Indonesia telecommunication firms, in which Smart-PLS application was used to analyze the data. The result show that digital leadership had direct and indirect impacts on customer experience orientation in developing business model innovation. The practical implications of these findings are recommended for the senior leader of management of telecommunications industries in Indonesia to strengthen digital leadership capability in conjunction with the development of business model innovation and customer experience orientation.

Digital transformations are required by Telecommunication firms to transform their portfolio beyond the pipeline to close the gap in business model innovations, redefine customer engagement and co-creation, and set up new distinctive organization capabilities. This paper has the objective to develop a digital transformation model by assessing the mediating role of co-creation strategy on the relationship between distinctive organizational capability and business model innovation. The units of analysis are Indonesian telecommunication firms, using a sample of 35 out of 445 telecommunication firms. The analytical approach used for analysis is Smart Partial Least Square (PLS). The study results reveal that distinctive organizational capability has an indirect effect on business model innovation, but direct effect to co-creation strategy. © 2018, Czestochowa University of Technology.

As the main aspect of business activities relates to the success of financial transactions, customer loyalty and price sensitivity becomes a decisive factor that defines market characteristics in the long run.

This paper has the objective to provide the antecedents of business model innovation and compare the effects of corporate reputation and distinctive organizational capability in developing business model innovation. The study is based on the digital disruption phenomenon, where established companies are disrupted by the new entries with the new business model that leverages digital capability. The study focuses on information, communication and technology (ICT) of the incumbent companies in developing business model innovations as the second curve in sustaining the business. The ICT industry is an important sector in the development of other industries and has a significant influence on economic growth, which currently relies on emerging markets such as Indonesia. The Indonesian ICT market has unique characteristics where innovation grows rapidly, but infrastructure lacks behind and the market is very competitive. This creates a gap between innovation opportunities and development of digital infrastructure. As for the incumbent firms, the mitigation of risks of the investment of ICT infrastructure and competition with new entries with their new business model and market. Incumbent firms still have the advantage of corporate reputation and are required to develop distinctive capability. However, the study of developing business model innovations for incumbent firms in the market with a focus on corporate reputation is still limited. The current study is an empirical study using a sample of 35 Indonesian ICT firms. Smart Partial Least Square (SmartPLS) is the analytical approach and solution technique used in the study. Research findings show that the distinctive organization capability has more influence compared to corporate reputation in developing business model innovations. The study implicates on the theory that the development of business model innovations should focus on distinctive organization capabilities rather than relying more heavily on corporate reputation. This means that ICT Incumbent firms are required to transform their capabilities to align with market changes. In terms of management, the study also implicates the urgency in developing distinctive organizational capabilities in respective units, especially in intangible assets. Further research can be explored by expanding the research sample and industry conducting longitudinal study on the transformational model of incumbent firms. © 2018, Universidad del Zulia.

This paper aims to discuss how ICT firms could manage the transformational performance by integrating business model innovations and co-creation strategy. The construction model of transformational performance and co-creation strategy is expected to contribute to the theory of performance and co-creation reviewed in literatures based on the Indonesian ICT phenomenon. Indonesia’s ICT Industry has gained the attention to be studied since it is one of the emerging markets with unique market characteristics with numerous opportunities but lacking the digital infrastructure. The digital transformation is required for firms to be able to sustain their business. Measurement on the success of implementing the transformation is one of the key success factors. The construction of the transformational performance variable is driven from the theory of quality management, balance scorecards and digital maturity. The construct could contribute as a reference model to track the firms’ transformational performance. In digital transformation and disruptive era, business models and co-creation are key factors to drive performance. Co-creation is one of the business model innovations that is done through collaboration and partnerships. It is also an integrated strategy used in order to perform in the market. To elaborate the model, we develop a prototype using a sample of 35 senior leaders from Indonesian ICT firms. Partial Least Square (PLS) is the statistical tool used to analyze the data foo this study. The findings show that a firm’s transformational performance is significantly influenced by business model innovations and co-creation strategy. Further findings show that in digital transformation, a firm cannot fulfill all core capabilities as it requires collaboration and crowd sourcing. Our selected examples are only prototypes of the research model and implications of this study are limited to their particular context. Ultimately, our research model requires further research and validation, which should be done in future studies. © 2018, Universidad del Zulia.

However, the nature of relationships between learning and innovation is less certain. This paper investigates the role of organizational learning capability in improving the innovation process within Indonesia's most reputable organization across all of its diverse subsidiary companies. A survey was conducted to help better understand and more systematically study this role. The data were collected from a sample of 82 top management executives obtained from 31 subsidiary companies. The results of this research show that organizational learning play a critically important role in enhancing the effectiveness of innovation value chain and should be viewed as a unitary process. © 2011 IEEE.","innovation capability; innovation value chain; organizational learning capability","Continuous improvements; Indonesia; Innovation capability; Innovation process; Organizational learning; Top management; Value chains; Industrial management; Innovation; Knowledge management; Engineering research",,,,,,,"Sawyer, G.C., Innovation in organizations (1978) Long Range Planning, 11 (6), pp. 53-57; Ray, G.F., Innovation as the source of long term economic growth (1980) Long Range Planning, 13 (2), pp. 9-19; Roper, S., Du, J., Love, J.H., Modelling the innovation value chain (2008) Research Policy, 37 (6-7), pp. 961-977; Nonaka, I., Takeuchi, H., The knowledge-creating company (2007) Harvard Business Review, 85 (7-8), p. 162; Scholz, R.W., Stauffacher, M., Managing transition in clusters: Area development negotiations as a tool for sustaining traditional industries in a Swiss prealpine region (2007) Environment and Planning A, 39 (10), p. 2518; Hurley, R.F., Hult, G.T.M., Innovation, market orientation, and organizational learning: An integration and empirical examination (1998) The Journal of Marketing, pp. 42-54; Hargadon, A., Brokering knowledge: Linking learning and innovation (2002) Research in Organizational Behaviour, 24, pp. 41-85; Limpibunterng, T., Johri, L.M., Complementary role of organizational learning capability in new service development (NSD) process (2009) The Learning Organization, 16 (4), pp. 326-348; Matheson, D., Matheson, J.E., (1998) The Smart Organization: Creating Value Through Strategic R&D, , Harvard Business Press; Hansen, M.T., Birkinshaw, J., The innovation value chain (2007) Harvard Business Review, 85 (6), p. 121; Boisot, M.H., Is your firm a creative destroyer?

Through the application of medical records that have good quality will affect the level of service to patients. Utilization of a good medical record management system, the orderly administration of health services becomes effective and efficient. In this research, the proposed systems are web-based and mobile application. The scope of the design evaluated is architectural design, flow chart design, data flow diagram design, database design and system interface design. The beginning of this research using exploratory method to make confirmation involving 5 doctors and nurses working in hospitals in Jakarta, and 72 road patients who are being treated. This study also involved IT consultants at the Hospital Accreditation Commission as a resource person who understood the problem of integrating the medical record system at the hospital. Data was collected through the distribution of questionnaires during the period January - April 2020. The objective of this research is to propose medical record information system that can improve input and output problems in the patient registration process, speed of service, medical record data processing and ease of tracking medical record information. © 2020 IEEE.","E-health; Healthcare; M-health; Smart healthcare system","Data flow graphs; Data handling; Flowcharting; Hospitals; Information management; Medical problems; Patient treatment; Surveys; Data flow diagrams; Health services; Input and outputs; Level of Service; Medical record systems; Mobile applications; Patient registration; System-interface design; Medical information systems",,,,,,"(2009) Undang-Undang Republik Indonesia Nomor 36 Tahun 2009, , Jakarta; (2018) Kementrian Kesehatan Republik Indonesia.

At times of crisis that is full of challenges, individuals who prefer to compelled to do what needs to protected from the negativity caused by the disaster. One who managed to save himself in times of crisis caused a panic of buying that happens a lot in retail stores. Companies must study the efforts made by buyers related to panic buying that is happening around them. Companies can explore these insights through sentiments formed from social media user posts on social media platforms. This research explores consumer sentiment related to panic purchases using qualitative analysis with NVivo software. The results of a study of 647 posts on Twitter microblogging revealed that panic buying contained negative attitude. Based on the results of this analysis, there are tactical steps that can be taken by companies in supporting individual efforts to protect themselves from losses caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. © 2020 IEEE.","COVID-19; Panic buying and protection motivation theory","Information management; Retail stores; Social networking (online); Viruses; Microblogging; Netnography; Qualitative analysis; Social media; Social media platforms; Virus spreads; Sales",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

However, no studies have tested the effects of the adoption of information technology on the performance of surveyors in performing their duties at the Indonesian Commission for Accreditation of Hospitals (KARS). The purpose of research is to test empirically the external factors that influence the adoption of applications for increased surveyors’ works performance as an assessor of hospitals in Indonesia. External factors studied were: (1) the support of top management, (2) self-efficacy, (3) the quality of the system, and (4) training. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is the best way to evaluate the factors that influence the decision of the assessor and the hospital professionals on the acceptance of a system. Through the distribution of questionnaires were processed using SmartPLS, proving that the four external factors studied had a significant influence on the acceptance of information technology. Based on observations also prove that through the use of Information System of Indonesian Commission for Accreditation of Hospitals or SIKARS application, assessor performance is more effective and efficient. So that, through the data and information provided on the application can support all stakeholders in decision-making. SIKARS as national accreditation database can be used as a reference for service quality improvement in Indonesian hospitals. ©BEIESP.","Hospitals accreditation; Information system of indonesian commission for accreditation of hospitals; Technology acceptance model",,,,,,"First Author Diyurman Gea is a senior faculty member at Bina Nusantara University, Jakarta, Indonesia.

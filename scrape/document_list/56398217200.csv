The focus of this study was HEI in Indonesia, that was the HEI’s National Quality Assurance Standard as a case. To define the component, this study applied a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to clarifying the composition of the EA framework. There were two EA frameworks that had been commonly used in HEI to further analyze the study, which were TOGAF and Zachman. The same process was done to define the HEI governance component. To seek the update education situation in 4.0 era, the exploration search was not just from HEI quality assurance and HEI value chain, but it came also from the future university. As a result, the EA component has seven groups and eight groups of components for HEI. Component between EA and HEI map was used to seek the relationship between components. HEI can use the map as a guideline when deciding to implement EA in their organization. Another result is that there are 16 components that are not directly discussed as Indonesia’s National Quality Assurance Standard. © 2019 ICIC International.","EA framework; Enterprise arhiteture; Higher eduation institution; Institution governanes; Systemati literature review",,,,,,,"de Vries, M., van Rensburg, A.C.J., Evaluating and refining the “enterprise arhiteture as strategy” approah and artefats (2009) The South African Journal of Industrial Engineering, 20 (1), pp. 31-44; (2018) University of the Future Bringing Education 4.0: Bringing Education to Life; Jairak, K., Praneetpolgrang, P., Applying IT governane balaned soreard and importane-performane analysis for providing IT governane strategy in university (2013) Information Management & Computer Security, 21 (4), pp. 228-249; Llamosa-Villalba, R., Carreño, L.T., Paez, Q.A.M., Delgado, Q.D.J., Barajas, A.B., Sney-Der, E.G., (2015) Enterprise Arhiteture of Olombian Higher Eduation, IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE); (2015) Social CRM in Higher Education: Model, Process, Channel Preference, and Critical Success Factors, , Ph.D. Thesis, University of Indonesia; Oderinde, D.O., (2012) Understanding Enterprise Architecture in Four UK Universities, , Ph.D. Thesis, University of Bolton; Tjong, Y., Adi, S., Kosala, R., Prabowo, H., A systemati mapping study on enterprise arhiteture mining (2018) International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Technology, pp. 403-411; Bokor, J., (2012) University of the Future: A Thousand Year Old Industry on the Usp of Profound Hange, , Ernst and Young; Zandi, F., Tavana, M., A fuzzy group multi-riteria enterprise arhiteture framework seletion model (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39 (1), pp. 1165-1173",,,,"ICIC International",,,,,21852766,,,,"English","ICIC Express Lett Part B Appl.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073316162

This program is planned, implemented, directed and supervised by the government so that the program's objectives are in line with the targets, namely poverty reduction. Many efforts have been made but the impact of this program has not been optimal, one of the reasons is the unavailability of object target data for these programs that state who the poor are and where they live for the basis of program intervention so that implementation is not on target as well as the realization report.

Education, health, and food are the three main points of concern to the government, besides unemployment, business opportunities, infrastructures, and village economics. The target is villagers and their communities. Today there are mainly three interventions of village development programs in education (Indonesia Smart Card), health (Indonesia Health Card) and food (Household Food Program) that supported by macro data only. Data on the number of villagers requiring education, health, food and data of village potential resources are available, but who and where they are cannot be known. Furthermore, at the village level, there is no such decision-making tools and no data that specifically refer to the object so that program interventions are often not targeted. The purpose of this paper is to design a database and application of village Business Intelligence (BI) by utilizing the GIS advantage to assist village officials and other government officials for decision making processes in the intervention of village community welfare development program. The methods used are literature studies of village legislation, surveys, and interviews. The result of this research is the design of dashboard including database and applications. © 2018 IEEE.","business intelligence; development; GIS; intervention; program; social welfare; village","Application programs; Competitive intelligence; Decision making; Geographic information systems; Health; Information analysis; Information management; Macros; Smart cards; development; intervention; program; Social welfare; village; Rural areas",,,,,,"Sharda, R., Delen, D., Turban, E., (2014) Business Intelligence and Analytics, System for Decision Support, , 10ed Pearson Edition Limited, ISBN 10: 1-292-00920-9; Elena, C., Business intelligence (2013) Journal of Knowledge Management, Economics and Information Technology, Titu Maiorescu University, Romania; Marakash, G.M., O'Brien, J.A., Introduction to information system (2013) McGraw-Hill Irwin, , 6th, ISBN: 978-0-01-131804-4; Jinpong, P., Jaroensutansinee, M., Jaroensutansinee, K., Business intelligence and its application in the public healthcare system (2011) Center of Excellent for Ecoinformatics, School of Science, WalailakUniversity, Nakhon Si Thammarat 80161, Thailand; Kodge, B.G., Hiremath, P.S., Web-based geo-spatial and village level information extraction system using foss (2012) Journal of Advances in Information Technology, 3 (4). , November; Parmanto, B., Spatial and multidimensional visualization of Indonesia's village health statistics (2008) International Journal of Health Geographics, 7, 30; Huisman, O.R.A., Principles geographic information system (2009) ITC Publisher, , ISBN-13 9789061642695; Monwar Alam, B., Application of geographic information systems (2012) InTech Publisher, , BN-13 9789535108245; Campbell, J., Shin, M., Essentials of geographic information systems (2011) Publisher: Flat World Knowledge, , BN-13 9781453321973; Shivpuje, P.R., Parmeshwar, V.P., Deshmukh, N.K., Application of Geoinformatics for Smart Village Creation (2017) International Journal of Computational Intelligence Research, 13 (5), pp. 1073-1081; Aronoff, S., Geographic information systems: A management perspective (1989) John Wiley, and Son; Owen, P., Hall, Using dashboard based (2003) Siness Intelligence Systems: An Approach to Improve Business Performance Graziadio Business Review; Verbert, K., Duval, E., Klerkx, J., Learning analytics dashboard applications (2013) American Behaveiuors Scientist (ABS); (2014) Indonesia Law of the Republic of Indonesia 6 the Year, , About Villages; (2005) Government Regulation, (72). , The year About Village; (2007) Regulation of the Minister of Home Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, , 12 The year About Villages; Regulation of the minister of village, development of underdeveloped regions, and transmigration of the republic of Indonesia (2017) On Determination of Priority of Village Fund Usage Year 2018 19 the Year; Regulation of the minister of home affairs of the republic of Indonesia 74 of the year (2015) The Procedure for Changing the Element of Population Data in Electronic Identity Cards; Regulation of the minister of home affairs of the republic of Indonesia 81 of the year (2015) Evaluation of Village Development; (2015) Decree of the Minister of Home Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia 12 of the Year the Implementation of Village Governments; (2015) Regulation of the Minister of Home Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia 39 of the Year the Code and Data of Regional Government Administration; Regulation of the minister of home Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia 5 of the year (2007) Guidelines for Regulating Community Institutions; Regional Profile Information System, the Minister of Home Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia Website, , http://www.sipd.go.id; National Policy Database System, State Secretariat of the Republic of Indonesia.

At the provincial level, almost all tourism business actors such as hotels, tourist destinations, and tourism travel bureaus, have websites to support promotional activities and marketing of tourism products. The website was developed for the purpose of disseminating information on Indonesian tourism products and attracting tourists as much as possible to visit tourism destinations. Currently tourism websites are generally built apart from each other so that sometimes inform the same tourism products but not complete and not support each other. Nevertheless the existence of the website has not been optimal in boosting the increase in the number of tourists visiting Indonesia, even when compared with neighboring countries the number of foreign tourists who come to Indonesia is still relatively low. The current information technology enables collaboration between websites so as to increase the chance of tourism information access for potential tourists both at home and abroad and impact on the increase of tourist visit. This paper aims to see the potential use of web and data communications technologies currently available to enhance the promotion and promotion of digital tourism. The method used is literature study, document study of tourism legislation and field survey to study the potential utilization of information and communication technology relevant to collaboration model and its implementation. The expected result is the recommendation of the strategy of tourism websites development and their implementation of collaboration at the provincial level so as to have an impact on the increasing number of tourists visiting the province. © IAEME Publication","Collaboration; Marketing; Promotion; Province; Tourism; Website",,,,,"039A/VR

Tourist visits from year to year have increased, but still below the number of countries in Southeast Asia. Under these conditions, the government, especially the tourism office needs to conduct a collaboration to maintain and increase the growth of the number of tourists visiting Indonesia. This study aims to integrate information services from other parties who collaborate to support tourism activities, especially collaboration at the provincial level. Related parties are the Tourism office, hotel, Travel & Tourism Agent and Tourism Destination. The integration of information is intended to facilitate access to information by tourists in accordance with their needs. Observation, literature study and information system integration design were used in this study. Observations were conducted at the tourism office and tourism destination in three different locations to obtain the needed information in Semarang, Surabaya and Yogyakarta. UML Modeling is used for system analysis and development. A prototype of information integration is generated, which can be used to integrate information between tourism office, hotel, Travel & Tourism Agent and tourism destination. With the Integration of such information each party will obtain a marketing benefit, income and other benefits economically. © 2017 IEEE.","information; integration; json; tourism; Web services","Information management; Information services; Integration; Websites; information; Information integration; Information system integration; json; Literature studies; Southeast Asia; tourism; Tourism activities; Web services",,,,,,"(2017) Perkembangan Pariwisata Dan Transportasi Nasional Maret 2017, , https://www.bps.go.id/website/brs_ind/brsInd-20170502115528.pdf, Badan Pusat Statistik, Mei; Adi, S., A collaborative tourism websites to support electronic promotion and marketing by using enterprise service bus (ESB (2016) Adv.

Higher education as a place to educate and share knowledge has to realize these phenomena. With social media, organization supports the knowledge sharing process within organization. Then it changes learning mechanism from e-learning into social learning environment. According to this fact, this research will combine the concepts of knowledge management and social learning as a model framework's component by identifying the significant factors and its relationship with social media. A systematic and relevant literature review from journals and textbooks was conducted to support the development of component framework model. As the result, we propose an integrated model of knowledge management with social learning for higher education. © 2016 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.","E-learning; Higher education; Knowledge management;

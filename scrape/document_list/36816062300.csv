Phintraco and how to minimize the risk of information technology. The research methodology used involves library research, documentation studies and interviews, collected data were analyzed using the NIST method. Results from this study indicate there are 13 types of risks that might occur, one of them at high risk (Malicious code) and there are two risks with a medium risk level (Information theft, server hangs). The conclusion was that risk control has been applied quite good but can still be improved controls to ensure company objectives achieved. Some of the controls that have been implemented quite well but still there are some weaknesses in it, among others: the password is not changed periodically, there is no documentation about the system, the right of access to the IT division is too free and antivirus programs inadequate. © 2010 IEEE.","Information technology; Measurement; NIST; Risk","Anti-virus programs; Company objectives; Information technology risks; Information thefts; Library research; Malicious codes; NIST; NIST method; Research methodologies; Risk controls; Risk levels; Information technology; Research; Telecommunication; Risk assessment",,,,,"(2010) Information Technology, , http://www.answers.com/topic/information-technology, Retrieve on May 2, 2010 from; Borade, G., (2009) Advantages of Information Technology, , http://www.buzzle.com/articles/advantages-of-information-technology.html, on May 2, 2010 from; (2004) Enterprise Risk Management, , www.coso.org/Publications/ERM/COSO_ERM_ExecutiveSummary.pdf, Retrieve on May 2, 2010 from; Djojosoedarso, S., (2005) Prinsip-prinsip Manajemen Risiko Asuransi, , Salemba Empat, Jakarta; Gever, J., (2010) IT Saves S3 Billion in VA Health System, , www.medpagetoday.com/PracticeManagement/InformationTechnology/19455, April 8, Retrieve on May 2, 2010 from; Klossner, K., (2009) Computer Information Technology - What It Is & Why It Is Important, , http://ezinearticles.com/?Computer-Information-Technology-What-it-is-and- Why-it-is-Important&id=2033670, Retrieve on May 2, 2010 from; Massing, E., (2009) Technical Support: Improving Performance and Reducing Costs with IT Risk Management, , http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=0&did=1924761451&SrchMode= 1&sid=4&Fmt=4&VInst=PROD&VType=PQD&RQT=309&VName= PQD&TS=1268427307&clientId=68814), Retrieve on May 2, 2010 from; McKendrick, J., (2009) Does IT Save More Energy Than It Consumes?

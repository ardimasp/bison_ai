This research will involve some numbers of respondent which are the health insurance participant. They will have to complete a survey for our data that make us possible to determine the factors affecting acceptance of the application. We made the survey questions based on TAM framework and one factor that we proposed. The questions consist of factors related to users’ view of service availability, usefulness, ease of use, attitude toward users using the application and users’ behaviour intention to use the application. A total of 88 respondents in this research indicate that the factors we have significantly impacted the users’ behavior to have intention to use the mobile app of health insurance. However, the result from our research using TAM framework and statistical factor analysis shows the hypotheses from TAM framework PU (Perceive of usefulness) affects BI (Behavioral Intention) were not supported in this research. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Dark tourism, as the niche of tourism offers an economic value for tourists' consumption that forged between reality and imagination. However, few studies were found to understand the realm of development of dark tourism varieties and attractions, which associated with death and suffering from lower political and ideology to the highest range while consuming it. Therefore, alongside the analytical thinking towards the product's typology and variety, the examination of both SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunity, Threats) model and TOWS (Threat-Opportunity & Weakness-Strength) matrix, synchronize the sites' elaboration resources and capabilities in which the dark tourism's place and space operate. Both of the qualitative case studies of Fatahillah Dungeon and Taman Prasasti museum provide the research practice that emerges from the visitors' voices. The findings deliver undiscovered value for the product development initiative, where at the same time bids the model for the dark tourism's consumption in term of the value creation and experience that giving the sites' meaning in recognizing how 'dark' the product is and stand out from the mass. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Museums; Tourism; Analytical thinking; Economic values; Qualitative case studies; Resources and capabilities; Value creation; Leisure industry",,,,,,"(2017) Travel & Tourism: Economic Impact 2017 - World, , WTTC; (2016) Global Travel & Tourism Economic Impact Update August 2016, , WTTC; Komsary, K.C., Commemorative Tourism: Menuju Sebuah Tipologi Daya Tarik Wisata Yang Berhubungan Dengan Kematian dan Bencana (2016) Jurnal Hospitality Dan Pariwisata, 2; Hartmann, R., Dark tourism, thanatourism, and dissonance in heritage tourism management: New directions in contemporary tourism research (2014) Journal of Heritage Tourism, 9 (2), pp. 166-182; Sharpley, R., Stone, P.R., (2009) The Darker Side of Travel: The Theory and Practice of Dark Tourism, 41; Tarlow, P.E., Novelli, M., (2007) Niche Tourism: Contemporary Issues, Trends and Cases, p. 47; (2018) Auswitch-Birkenau Attendance, , http://auschwitz.org/en/visiting/attendance/, [cited 2018 23 April 2018]; Blair, J., (2002) The New York Times; (2018) Tripadvisor.

IoT can be applied in supporting an environmentally friendly tourism industry. This study aims to see the possibilities of implementing IoT in the tourism SMEs (small-medium enterprises) by designing a simple prototype of a light controlling device as a solution to reduce energy consumption in the tourism-related industry. The prototype was designed by collaborating IoT, mobile devices and sensors in an electronic device (microcontroller Atmega 328P-PU) for lighting control. Furthermore, the switching device can be operated using an Android-based smartphone. The black box test examining the functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures or workings was carried out in the system, both server and client. The test results indicate that the device is functional, and wider use of IoT in the tourism industry in Indonesia is possible with a breakthrough in exploring the use of information technology. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Atmega 328P microcontroller; Internet of Things (IoT); Lights controlling",,,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

By empowering local community, business competition has led to the undesired development of the tourism sector. This becomes the concern of the negative impact of physical changes in the area. This study aims to identify and measure the acceptable changes (limits of acceptable change-LAC) of tourism development in Pangandaran to remain adaptable as a tourist attraction. This study considers how to determine acceptable levels of impact that occurs in the Pangandaran area. This method involves stakeholders in determining the values, issues, and concerns the acceptable levels of impact for this region. The result of acceptance rate then compared with the effects of the current state. Through review and analysis methods used in this study, the LAC situation in Pangandaran outlined.

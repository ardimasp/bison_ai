One of these structural systems is the outrigger system. Outrigger is one of the structural stiffening systems that can be used on building structures, especially in high-rise buildings. Structural systems such as outriggers are used for earthquake-resistant buildings, so the performance of building structures can be increased by producing minimum displacement. This research will design the building as high as 40 and 50 floors, with the calculation of earthquake based on Indonesia Earthquake Design Code SNI 1726-2012. This study will be compared the calculation of seismic loads in the building structure with and without using outrigger, so that it can be seen the difference in the seismic loads and the performance of the structure. From this research, it is found that the outrigger system can reduce the seismic loads in the structure, and also is able to reduce the lateral displacement of the structure. The inter-story lateral displacement of 50 storey and 40 storey structure can be reduce up to 2.06% and 7.84% with one outrigger and 3.76% and 12, 49% with two outrigger. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","earthquake; high-rise building; lateral displacement; load distribution; outrigger","Earthquake engineering; Earthquakes; Electric power plant loads; Loads (forces); Tall buildings; Building structure; Earthquake-resistant buildings; High rise building; High-rise building structure; Lateral displacements; Load distributions; outrigger; Performance of buildings; Structural design",,,,,"Alok, R., Savita, M., The Behavior of Outrigger Structural System in High-Rise Building: Reviews (2017) International Journal of Science, Engineering and Technology Research (IJSETR); Fauzan, K., Faimun, Tavio, (2017) Desain Modifikasi Struktur Edung Apartemen Gunawangsa Tidar Surabaya Menggunakan Struktur Beton Bertulang Dengan Sistem Outrigger Dan Belt-Truss; Gerasimidis, S., Efthymiou, E., Baniotopoulos, C.C., (2009) Optimum Outrigger Locations of High-Rise Steel Buildings for Wind Loading; Standardisasi Nasional, B., (2012) Tata Cara Perencanaan Ketahanan Gempa Untuk Struktur Bangunan Gedung Dan Non-Gedung; Wai-Ming Ho Arup, G., The Evolution of Outrigger System in Tall Buildings (2016) International Journal of High-Rise Buildings, 5; Wiratman, W., Struktur Unik Gedung MNC Media Tower Bertingkat 56 di Jakarta (2013) Konferensi Nasional Teknik Sipil ke-7","Suangga, M.; Civil Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: suangga@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The purpose of this research was to predict whirlwind in Cilacap region of Central Java using meteorological parameters as predictive parameters and adaptive neighborhood modified backpropagation (ANMBP) parameters as a prediction method. In the preprocessing process, the input data variable was reduced from seven input variables to five input variables by using the principal component analysis (PCA) method. The prediction process using ANMBP, and trial and error processes are carried out repeatedly by changing the hidden layer values, learning rate, and the amount of training and testing data. The best performance is obtained from the distribution of training and testing data at 60–40%, it produced an MSE value of 0.0004, and accuracy is 85.59% using two hidden layers with values of 110 and 95 and learning rate of 0.1. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Adaptive neighborhood modified backpropagation; ANMBP; PCA; Small tornado; Whirlwinds","Backpropagation; Disasters; Adaptive neighborhood; Meteorological parameters; Modified backpropagation; Natural disasters; Prediction methods; Prediction process; Training and testing; Trial-and-error process; Forecasting",,,,,"Ginzburg, E., Journey into the Whirlwind, , Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Boston; Suryantoro, A., Siklon Tropis di Selatan dan Barat Daya Indonesia dari Pemantauan Satelit TRMM dan Kemungkinan Kaitannya dengan Gelombang Tinggi dan Puting Beliung (2010) Maj.

Early identification is needed to prevent a lot of casualties and losses. Whirlwind caused by instability in the atmosphere. Instability in the atmosphere usually occurs at the beginning of the day and the whirlwind can be identified based on the upper air parameter which can represent atmospheric instability. The purpose of this research is to optimize SVM classification with SMOTE algorithm to handling problems in imbalanced data and this research can minimize casualties and losses or also be a breakthrough for disaster-prone areas to be given early warning. The process for identifying whirlwind has several stages, namely pre-processing, imbalanced data handling, and classification. Pre-processing is normalized data. Whirlwind data has a classification problem, namely inter-class data that is not balanced so it needs to be corrected using the SMOTE Algorithm. Research on the identification of whirlwind using a combination of SMOTE-SVM produces the best accuracy is 98.8 %. When compared to data without the SMOTE algorithm the results obtained are better if the SMOTE method is applied. The specificity value is also better when given the SMOTE method. Based on these results it can be concluded that SMOTE can overcome the problem of imbalanced data in the upper air data by increasing the value of the classification of the whirlwind. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Classification (of information); Disasters; Support vector machines; Upper atmosphere; Early warning; Imbalanced data; Inter class; Natural disasters; Pre-processing; SMOTE algorithm; SVM classification; SVM classifiers; Data handling",,,,,"Cahyadi, A., Mada, U.G., (2017) Peringatan Dini Puting Beliung di Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta; Davies-Jones, R., Trapp, R.J., Bluestein, H.B., Tornadoes and Tornadic Storms Severe Convective Storms, Meteorological Monographs, 28, pp. 167-221; Doswell, C.A., Weiss, S.J., Johns, R.H., (2011) Tornado Forecasting: A Review, pp. 557-571; Trafalis, T.B., Adrianto, I., Richman, M.B., Lakshmivarahan, S., Machine-learning classifiers for imbalanced tornado data (2014) Comput.

This paper develops Bayesian forecasting method of counts whose conditional distributions given past observations and explanatory variables follow a Poisson distribution. To determine a forecasted value of an observation-driven integer valued autoregressive model, a series of well thought alghoritm needs to be developed, resulting in the use of Bayesian framework. This effective alghoritm sets is then used for the aforementioned calculation for the modelling of time series count data. To get the demanded results, a particle MCMC algorithm for the autoregressive Poisson regression model is introduced in the equation. Two real-life data sets, monthly demand for medicines type X and type Y (2016-2018) are successfully be analysed. We also illustrate that the Bayesian forecasting is more accurate than the corresponding frequentist's approach. © 2019 The Authors.

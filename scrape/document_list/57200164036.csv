While face attractiveness classification seems to be related to personal preference, building a robust attractiveness classifier is not impossible. There are several studies that have developed a classification system of facial attractiveness using a convolutional neural network and provide satisfactory results. The use of Image-net pre-trained convolutional neural network has been largely used by face-related research, yet none of them are related to facial attractiveness. This study aims to compare the famous deep learning architecture, such as VGG, Inception, and ResNet models. This research also aims to analyze the effect of using the Viola-Jones algorithm, as a preprocessing method, to the classification result of the built model. Viola-Jones algorithm will detect faces in image data, and 2 types of cropping will be done to extract the face region from the image, namely loose-crop and tight-crop. This research produces the highest accuracy value of 82.52% by using ResNet50 model and loose-crop preprocessing method. © 2018 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Face Recognition; Facial Attractiveness","Classification (of information); Convolution; Crops; Data mining; Face recognition; Grading; Neural networks; Classification results; Classification system; Convolutional neural network; Facial attractiveness; Learning architectures; Personal preferences; Pre-processing method; Viola - Jones algorithms; Deep learning",,,,,"Talamas, S.N., Mavor, K.I., Perrett, D.I., Blinded by beauty: Attractiveness bias and accurate perceptions of academic performance (2016) PLoS One, 11 (2); Foo, Y.Z., Simmons, L.W., Rhodes, G., Predictors of facial attractiveness and health in humans (2017) Sci.

Unfortunately, every research has its own limitations and are still unable to be used commercially. Some of the researches have known to be successful for recognizing sign language, but require an expensive cost to be commercialized. Nowadays, researchers have gotten more attention for developing Sign Language Recognition that can be used commercially. Researchers do their researches in various ways. It starts from the data acquisition methods. The data acquisition method varies because of the cost needed for a good device, but cheap method is needed for the Sign Language Recognition System to be commercialized. The methods used in developing Sign Language Recognition are also varied between researchers. Each method has its own strength compare to other methods and researchers are still using different methods in developing their own Sign Language Recognition. Each method also has its own limitations compared to other methods. The aim of this paper is to review the sign language recognition approaches and find the best method that has been used by researchers. Hence other researchers can get more information about the methods used and could develop better Sign Language Application Systems in the future. © 2017 The Authors.

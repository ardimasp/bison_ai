For example, in Jakarta, Indonesia, in some roadway, motorcycle is the most dominant vehicle, with total volume is four times higher than a passenger car. Thus, the traffic characteristic in motorcycle-dominated traffic differs from a common traffic situation. The purpose of this study is to apply the concept and theory developed to analyze motorcycle behaviour under motorcycle-dominated traffic condition. The survey is applied by recording the traffic flow movement of research location at specified time period. The macroscopic characteristic analyzed in this research is a speed-flow relationship based on motorcycle equivalent unit (MCU). Furthermore, a detail microscopic characteristic analyzed that is motorcycle time headway regarding traffic flow. MCU values computed were consists of motorcycle (MC), light vehicle (LV) and heavy vehicle (HV). Those values were calculated 1.00, 6.13 and 10.71 respectively. The speed and volume relationship result is showing a linear regression model with R2 value is 0.58, it can be explained that the correlation between two variables is intermediate. The headway distribution of motorcycle is compatible with the negative exponential distribution which fitted with the proposed theory for a small vehicle such as a motorcycle. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","flow; headway distribution; motorcycle equivalent unit; transportation modes","Developing countries; Linear regression; Microcontrollers; Regression analysis; Speed control; Traffic control; Traffic surveys; Urban growth; Vehicles; flow; Headway distribution; Linear regression models; Microscopic characteristics; Negative exponential distribution; Speed-volume relationships; Traffic characteristics; Transportation mode; Motorcycles",,,,,"Minh, C.C., Sano, K., Mai, T.T., Matsumoto, S., Development of motorcycle unit (MCU) for motorcycle-dominated traffic (2010) J.

The system generates power, cooling, and desalinated water embracing a Kalina cycle in integration with an ejector refrigeration cycle and a humidification dehumidification-based desalination. A parametric study is conducted to analyze the influence of variation in some design parameters on the system's performance. The results indicates that both energy and exergy efficiencies enhance as separator pressure, vapor generator terminal temperature difference and condenser temperature decrease, and evaporator temperature increase. Additionally, Ammonia concentration in the Ammonia–water mixture is seen to have opposing effects on efficiencies. The desalinated water production rate reaches a maximum value of 1.34 kg/s when the Ammonia concentration is equal to 22–23%. Moreover, this parameter declines as the separator pressure increases, and remains unchanged when the evaporator temperature varies. As for cooling, it is deduced that augmentations in separator pressure, evaporator temperature, and vapor generator terminal temperature difference contribute to improvements in cooling output. In a regular input situation, energy and exergy efficiencies, net output power, cooling, and desalinated water production rate are found to be 60.4%, 39.7%, 559.8 kW, 604.7 kW, and 1.31 kg/s, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Desalinated water; Ejector refrigeration cycle; Energy and exergy; Kalina cycle; Ship's engine; Trigeneration","Ammonia; Desalination; Engines; Evaporators; Exergy; Humidity control; Refrigeration; Separators; Ships; Water filtration; Ammonia concentrations; Condenser temperature; Ejector refrigeration; Energy and exergy efficiency; Evaporator temperature; Humidification-dehumidification; System's performance; Trigeneration systems; Temperature",,,,,,,"Jana, K., Ray, A., Majoumerd, M.M., Assadi, M., De, S., Polygeneration as a future sustainable energy solution–a comprehensive review (2017) Appl.

In this paper, hollow cylindrical configuration is investigated as a novel leg structure for thermoelectric module in which the n-type and p-type legs are placed co-axial inside each other. A validated 3D numerical simulation was employed to investigate the proposed structure from thermal, economic, exergetic and mechanical viewpoints. The cylindrical ring-shape co-axial configuration can be made in different azimuthal angle, slant angle and width ratio all of which are probed in this research under different boundary conditions. The ring shape structure is able to reduce the thermal-stresses level without the reduction of thermal efficiency. Results indicate that the increment of hot side temperature can improve the output power and conversion efficiency of the cylindrical thermoelectric generator (CTEG) device but reduces the mechanical reliability of the system. It addition, with increment of slant angle of thermoelectric legs, the maximum Von Mises stress in the legs increases and power output of the CTEG is improved. The increase of the width ratio leads to the improvement of the output power and reduction of conversion and exergy efficiencies. Moreover, it is proved that the azimuthal angle of CTEG device has minor impact on the conversion and exergy efficiencies. It is found that the Von Mises stress attains the peak values in the contact regions between wielding layers and hot sides of the legs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cylindrical; Ring-shape; Seebeck; Thermoelectric","Conversion efficiency; Electronic equipment; Exergy; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectricity; 3-D numerical simulation; Cylindrical configurations; Different boundary condition; Exergy efficiencies; Mechanical reliability; Ring-shape structures; Thermo-electric modules; Thermoelectric generators; Thermoelectric energy conversion",,,,,"This work was financially supported by the Key project of the National Social Science Foundation of the year 2018(18AJY013); the 2017 National Social Science Foundation project (17CJY072); the 2018 Planning Project of Philosophy and Social Science of Zhejiang province (18NDJC086YB); the 2018 Fujian Social Science Planning Project (FJ2018B067); The Planning Fund Project of Humanities and Social Sciences Research of the Ministry of Education in 2019 (19YJA790102).",,"Yan, S.R., Fazilati, M.A., Samani, N., Ghasemi, H., Toghraie, D., Nguyen, Q., Karimipour, A., Energy efficiency optimization of the waste heat recovery system with embedded phase change materials in greenhouses: A thermo-economic-environmental study (2020) J.

In this work, a novel biomass fueled externally fired gas turbine with closed cycle is introduced. Then its exhaust heat is utilized for power generation via organic Rankine cycle or inlet cooling of gas compressor via an absorption cooling cycle. Comprehensive analysis and performance comparison is made for proposed two systems from thermoeconomic standpoint. The effects of key design variables are examined on their performance and two-objective optimization is accomplished by genetic algorithm procedure to determine the optimum operating points based on levelized cost of electricity and exergetic efficiency. The results indicted superiority of waste heat utilization for compressor inlet cooling than the use of it for power generation, for all the variety of operating/design conditions. It is found that, at multi-objective optimal points, the gas turbine system with inlet cooling has 11.2% higher exergy efficiency and 12.3% lower electricity cost than the gas turbine system combined with organic Rankine cycle. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass gasification; Closed cycle gas turbine; LCOE; Multi-objective optimization; Thermoeconomic","Absorption refrigeration; Biomass; Compressibility of gases; Conversion efficiency; Costs; Gas absorption; Gas compressors; Gas turbines; Gases; Genetic algorithms; Rankine cycle; Sustainable development; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Comprehensive analysis; Exergetic efficiency; Externally fired gas turbines; Levelized cost of electricities; Organic Rankine cycles; Performance comparison; Sustainable energy development; Two-objective optimization; Absorption cooling",,,,,,,"Siddiqui, O., Dincer, I., Yilbas, B.S., Development of a novel renewable energy system integrated with biomass gasification combined cycle for cleaner production purposes (2019) J.

This study by presenting a multiobjective mixed integer mathematical model for the location-routing of the medical relief problem at the time of a disaster, proposes a new extension to this applicable model with reliability considerations. The proposed model focuses on the location of temporary relief centers and delivers the pharmaceutical commodities to centers at the shortest possible time with reliability assurance. The model includes three simultaneous objectives of minimizing response time, minimizing operational costs, and maximizing the reliability of the transportation network. As far as we know, this study firstly optimizes these three objectives simultaneously. Another novelty is to add the uncertainty of the problem. In this regard, the inherent uncertainty is formulated by a scenario-based approach. Considering the multiobjectiveness of the proposed model, the Epsilon constraint method as a solution algorithm has been used to solve the model. Results are tested for numerical examples via different scenarios. The results represent the excellent performance of the model to minimize the costs and to increase the reliability for the proposed location-routing problem of relief commodities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Mixed integer programming;

The feasibility of the proposed cogeneration system is evaluated using exergy and thermal balance relations as the utmost productive tools. A comprehensive parametric evaluation is conducted, and it is found that the thermal and energetic performances of the unit can be maximized with adjusting separator 2 pressure. An accord with the performed parametric evaluation, it is discerned that the thermal efficiency of the devised electricity/cooling system can be enhanced with the booster pressure ratio and evaporator temperature. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the exergy efficiency improves with reducing the booster pressure ratio, condenser pressure, and evaporator temperature or rising separator 1 pressure. Later, the productivity of the suggested set-up is optimized by highlighting energy and exergy efficiencies. Considering energy and exergy efficiencies simultaneously in an optimization mode, it is found that the net generated electricity and exergy efficiency can be improved by 62.33% and 57.78%, respectively. In addition, the results indicated that the highest exergy destruction rate is related to the condenser by the value of 3425 kW. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cogeneration; Double-flash binary geothermal; Ejector; Exergy; Genetic algorithm; Optimization","Cogeneration plants; Cooling; Evaporators; Exergy; Geothermal energy; Geothermal power plants; Multiobjective optimization; Separators; Cogeneration systems; Condenser pressure; Energy and exergy efficiency; Evaporator temperature; Exergy destructions; Exergy efficiencies; Thermal efficiency; Thermodynamic evaluation; Parameter estimation; cogeneration; cooling; detection method; electricity; energy efficiency; equipment; geothermal energy; optimization; performance assessment; temperature effect; thermodynamics",,,,,,,"Aleklett, K., Höök, M., Jakobsson, K., Lardelli, M., Snowden, S., Söderbergh, B., The peak of the oil age–analyzing the world oil production reference scenario in world energy outlook 2008 (2010) Energy Pol, 38 (3), pp. 1398-1414; Kåberger, T., Progress of renewable electricity replacing fossil fuels (2018) Glob.

Geothermal energy as a reliable sustainable resource has significant potential in the mitigation of greenhouse gas and pollution emissions. In this article, three different geothermal-based systems are designed for hydrogen and electricity production. All three configurations used the same low-temperature geothermal energy. The three proposed systems include ORC, APC and KCS system integrated with PEM technology. These systems are analyzed and compared to energy, exergy, thermoeconomic aspects. The net thermal productivity for the PEM-ORC system, PEM-APC system, and PEM-KCS system are respectively 11.89%, 13.46%, and 11.05%. The overall exergy efficiency for the PEM-ORC system, PEM-APC system, and PEM-KCS system are respectively 50.82%, 48.41%, and 49.02%. The hydrogen production rate of three configurations of PEM-ORC, PEM-APC, and PEM-KCS is 4.78 kg/h, 5.154 kg/h and 4.581 kg/h. Besides the total SUCP of the PEM-ORC unit is 76.72 $/GJ. The net SUCP of the PEM-APC system is 78.89 $/GJ, this value for combined PEM-KCS is 259.9 $/GJ. Moreover, a comprehensive sensitivity evaluation is carried out on the system to evaluate the impact of the key variables on the operation of the plant. Then, optimization procedures are conducted for all three systems. Four TOED, EOED, SOED and MOED methods are employed for this purpose. The SOED method decreased the SUCP of the PEM-KSC system significantly about 22%. The MOED enhances the exergy productivity of the PEM-ORC system about 10%. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Energy; Exergy; Geothermal; Hydrogen production; Low temperature source","Exergy; Fossil fuels;

This paper aims to design and develop a thermodynamic model and a multi-criteria optimization of thermal performance for a DX-SAHPWH using R-134a as the working refrigerant that supplies domestic hot water for a typical building throughout the whole year. The thermodynamic model of the DX-SAHPWH is developed so that the performance of the system is solved through the try and error technique with the least initial data of the thermodynamic cycle of DX-SAHPWH. After the validation of the thermodynamic model, the performance of the DX-SAHPWH is analyzed for a typical building located at the temperate climate of Iran. Then, a parametric study is conducted to identify how various design parameters may affect the performance of the DX-SAHPWH system. In the current investigation, the effects of design parameters including solar radiation intensity, ambient air temperature, outlet water temperature of the condenser, solar collector area, compressor speed, length of tube in the condenser, external diameter of the tube in collector plate, fin thickness, and thermal conductivity of collector plate on the performance of the DX-SAHPWH are investigated. Besides, single and bi-criteria optimizations are carried out using genetic algorithm (GA) to obtain the optimal solutions of design parameters, where the coefficient of performance (COP) and the solar collector efficiency (SCE) are selected as two fitness functions. The optimal solutions achieved from the bi-criteria optimization process will be given as Pareto frontier. The final optimum solution from the available solutions on the Pareto optimal frontier is selected using decision-making methods, such as LINMAP, TOPSIS, and Shannon's Entropy. The comparison of single and bi-criteria optimization results illustrate that the bi-criteria optimization method yields more proper results than single ones, mainly because of the lower deviation index from the ideal solution. The results of bi-criteria optimization show that SCE decreases 1.6% compared to the initial model while the COP increases close to 20% that makes the optimum solution more desirable compared to the single ones. Moreover, the performance of the optimized DX-SAHPWH system is compared with the initial model in each month of the year. The results indicate that the performance of the optimized DX-SAHPWH is highly improved so that the working hours of the system decrease close to 109 h compared to the initial model during the whole year. © 2020","Coefficient of performance; Decision-making; Direct-expansion solar-assisted heat pump; Multi-objective optimization; Parametric study; Solar collector efficiency","Climate models; Coefficient of performance; Collector efficiency; Condenser tubes; Decision making; Energy harvesting; Genetic algorithms; Heat pump systems; Hot water distribution systems; Hot working; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal systems; Pareto principle; Radiation effects; Solar radiation; Solar water heaters; Thermal conductivity; Water heaters; Ambient air temperature; Bicriteria optimization; Coefficient of performances (COP); Multicriteria optimization; Outlet-water temperatures; Pareto-optimal frontiers; Solar assisted heat pump; Solar radiation intensity; Structural design",,,,,,,"Blackman, C., Bales, C., Thorin, E., Techno-economic evaluation of solar-assisted heating and cooling systems with sorption module integrated solar collectors (2015) Energy Procedia, 70, pp. 409-417; Zhai, X.Q., Wang, R.Z., Dai, Y.J., Wu, J.Y., Xu, Y.X., Ma, Q., Solar integrated energy system for a green building (2007) Energy Build., 39 (8), pp. 985-993; Mateus, T., Oliveira, A.C., Energy and economic analysis of an integrated solar absorption cooling and heating system in different building types and climates (2009) Appl.

Most recently, segmented annular thermoelectric was proposed as an efficient structure for annular thermoelectric in which each leg of thermoelectric (n-type and p-type) is made of two different materials termed low temperature material and high temperature material. Although a few of investigations have reported thermal behavior of segmented annular thermoelectric, no exergetic and economic analysis have been performed yet on segmented annular thermoelectric generators. Exergetic and economic evaluations are significant criteria on marketing area of any industrial product. Hence, in this study, a comparison between segmented and non-segmented annular thermoelectric is first presented and then the impacts of the main parameters of segmented annular thermoelectric generator on energy, exergy and economic factors (including output power, conversion efficiency, exergy efficiency and cost per unit of output power) are comprehensively investigated and presented via validated 3-D numerical simulation method. The results showed that the segmented thermoelectric is more efficient than the non-segmented thermoelectric from the viewpoint of all said criteria.

Although there is bulk of research on environmental Kuznets curve (EKC), very limited studies explored the scope in context of tourism in BRICS countries. So this research is conducted to explore the association of tourism, renewable energy, and economic growth with carbon emissions by using annual data of BRICS countries from the year 1995 to 2018. By using the recent approach of method of moments quantile regression (MMQR), the finding shows that tourism has stronger significant negative effects from 10th to 40th quantile while the effects are insignificant at remaining quantiles. Furthermore, an inverted U-shape EKC curve is also apparent at all quantiles excluding 10th and 20th quantiles. For renewable energy, the results are found negatively significant across all quantiles (10th–90th) which claim that CO2 emission can be reduced by opting renewable sources. Hence, the empirical results of the current study provide insights for policymakers to consume renewable energy sources for the sustainable economic growth and solution of environmental problems. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","BRICS;

No experimental-data-based economic evaluation has been carried out before for cooling/heating aim of Peltier effect. Obviously, lack of economic analysis results in incorrect or imperfect decision-making on marketing area of any product. This paper focuses on cold and hot water production by thermoelectricity and provides a comprehensive thermal/economic/exergetic evaluation for said application using recently developed SPECO (Specific Exergy Costing) method. The effect of all thermal/flow and electrical parameters are investigated. The formulation/evaluation process of economic factors is explained step by step to make it ease understanding for the future readers. The results showed that, obtaining for example 1 kWh energy in the form of water cooling or heating is much more cheaper if the input power (DC voltage) of any individual thermoelectric is adjusted in lower value. However, it will take more time to obtain 1 kWh cooling/heating energy when the input power is low. Hence, it is recommended to produce the cold/hot water in no-peak water consumption times with lower input power and store it (instead of cold/hot water production with higher input power through shorter time). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Economic study; Peltier; SPECO∖; Water cooler/heater","Cooling; Decision making; Peltier effect; Thermoelectric power; Cold and hot waters; Economic evaluations; Economic factors; Electrical parameter; Specific exergy; Water consumption; Water cooling; Water production; Economic analysis",,,,,"This work was financially supported by the Key project of the National Social Science Fundation of the year 2018 ( 18AJY013 ); the 2017 National Social Science foundation project ( 17CJY072 ); the 2018 planning project of philosophy and social science of zhejiang province ( 18NDJC086YB ); the 2018 Fujian Social Science Planning Project ( FJ2018B067 ); The Planning Fund Project of Humanities and Social Sciences Research of the Ministry of Education in 2019 ( 19YJA790102 ).",,"Agwu Nnanna, A.G., Rutherford, W., Elomar, W., Sankowski, B., Assessment of thermoelectric module with nanofluid heat exchanger.

Considering the rising emphasis of economies in utilizing natural resources to attain higher levels of globalization, the current research was aimed at investigating how the returns of natural resources and globalization affect energy consumption in top Asian economies. In doing so, the study emphasized the nonlinear relationship among the variables and applied the novel nonparametric method of causality in quantile to identify the quantile-based causal connection of natural resources and globalization on the returns and volatility of energy utilization in selected Asian countries. Moreover, the presence of nonlinearity in the variables was tested by the Brock- Dechert-Scheinkman test (BDS test), which confirmed that all variables showed nonlinear behavior. Furthermore, the findings of quantile cointegration confirmed a nonlinear long-run relationship of natural resources and globalization with energy utilization. The prime findings of causality in quantile revealed that the returns of natural resources and globalization had a significant causal effect on the returns of energy consumption in all countries. On the other hand, the volatility in energy consumption concluded no causal association with the returns of natural resources and globalization in any of the studied Asian countries. The findings are beneficial for the policymakers to formulate policies that will help to reduce the level of energy consumption. © 2020 by the authors.","Energy; Globalization; Natural resources; Nonparametric causality in quantiles","Energy policy; Sustainable development; Asian countries; Brock-dechert-scheinkman; Cointegration; Environmental sustainability; Non-linear relationships; Non-parametric; Nonlinear behavior; Nonparametric methods; Energy utilization",,,,,,,"Balcilar, M., Bekiros, S., Gupta, R., The role of news-based uncertainty indices in predicting oil markets: A hybrid nonparametric quantile causality method (2017) Empir.

The study evaluates the asymmetric impact of textile manufacturing on energy intensity in leading Asian economies based on textile dominance. China, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand, Japan and Vietnam are dominant in textile manufacturing. In the present study we used yearly textiles and clothing data from top ten selected Asian textile manufacturing countries from 1990 to 2018. The results of quantile-on-quantile regression (QQ) confirmed that textiles and clothing (T&C) production have a positive and significant impact on energy intensity in all countries. The results further suggested that a low level of T&C production increases the level of energy intensity in all selected countries. On the other hand, the results of Granger causality in quantiles confirm a bidirectional causal relationship between T&C production and energy intensity in all selected countries except Thailand and Japan, where a uni-directional causal connection between textile and clothing manufacturing and energy intensity can also be found. This study recommends that governments and investors need to invest more in green and advanced technologies to reduce the energy intensity in Asian economies. © 2020 by the authors.","Asian countries; Energy intensity; Non-linear model; Quantile-on-quantile","Garment industry; Textile processing; Textiles; Advanced technology; Causal relationships; Energy intensity; Granger Causality; Production increase; Quantile regression; Textile and clothings; Textile manufacturing; Textile industry",,,,,,,"Jomo, K.S., (2013) Industrializing Malaysia: Policy, Performance, Prospects, , Routledge: Abingdon, UK; Huang, B., Zhao, J., Geng, Y., Tian, Y., Jiang, P., Energy-related ghg emissions of the textile industry in china (2017) Resour.

The Takaful industry is facing stiff competition with conventional insurance industry in Malaysia and Indonesia as the Southeast Asian region has a large Muslim population. SRP is crucial in insurance industry specifically in the Islamic Insurance (Takaful) industry and plays a vital and key role in sustainable competitive advantage for value addition for firms in future to acquire market. Design/methodology/approach: The data was collected from 350 front line agents of the Takaful industry operating in Malaysia and Indonesia on convenience sampling technique. Data was analyzed by using PLS-SEM to examine the relationship between constructs. Findings: The results show that human capital, training and reward significantly influence commitment of employee which further influenced SRP to be improved. Mediation effect was also found to be influential and statistically positive and significant by employee commitment between key HR practices (human capital, training, rewards) and SRP. Originality/value: current study contributed to the body of knowledge in explaining relationship of human capital to employee commitment and SRP, further, inconclusive findings between training and rewards was also explained in the Takaful industry of the Southeast Asian region. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Employee commitment (EC); Human capital (HC); Rewards (RE); Service recovery performance (SRP); Training (TR)",,,,,,,,"Abbas, S.K., Hassan, H.A., Asif, J., Junaid, H.M., Zainab, F., (2018) What are the key determinants of mobile banking adoption in Pakistan?; Abbas, S.K., Hassan, H.A., Hashmi, Z.M., Junaid, H.M., Majid, S., Ijaz, T., Intellectual capital impact on organizations' performance (2018) International Journal of Advanced Engineering, Management and Science, 4 (7); Abbas, S.K., Hassan, H.A., Iftikhar, S., Waris, A., (2018) Assimilation of TTF and UTAUT for Mobile Banking Usage; Akhgari, M., Bruning, E.R., Finlay, J., Bruning, N.S., Image, performance, attitudes, trust, and loyalty in financial services (2018) International Journal of Bank Marketing; Al-Ababneh, M.M., Al-Sabi, S.M., Al-Shakhsheer, F.J., Ma'moun, A.H., Mediating role of empowerment between total quality management (Tqm) and service recovery performance in the hotel industry (2018) Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, 6 (3), pp. 286-313; Amron, A., Usman, U., Mursid, A., Buying decision in the marketing of Sharia life insurance (evidence from Indonesia) (2018) Journal of Islamic Marketing(just-accepted); Ashill, N.J., Carruthers, J., Krisjanous, J., Antecedents and outcomes of service recovery performance in a public health-care environment (2005) Journal of Services Marketing, 19 (5), pp. 293-308; Asiaei, K., Jusoh, R., Bontis, N., Intellectual capital and performance measurement systems in Iran (2018) Journal of Intellectual Capital, 19 (2), pp. 294-320; Babakus, E., Yavas, U., Karatepe, O.M., Avci, T., The effect of management commitment to service quality on employees' affective and performance outcomes (2003) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 31 (3), pp. 272-286; Bayburina, E., Golovko, T., Design of sustainable development: intellectual value of large BRIC companies and factors of their growth (2009) Electronic Journal of Knowledge Management, 7 (5), pp. 535-558; Bontis, N., Chua Chong Keow, W., Richardson, S., Intellectual capital and business performance in Malaysian industries (2000) Journal of Intellectual Capital, 1 (1), pp. 85-100; Boshoff, C., Allen, J., The influence of selected antecedents on frontline staff's perceptions of service recovery performance (2000) International Journal of Service Industry Management, 11 (1), pp. 63-90; Bulimo, A.M., (2014) Effects of Technology on the Recruitment and Placement of Women Employee's in Chemelil Sugar Company, , Moi University, Kenya; CheRusuli, M., Zakaria, M., Azemawati, I., Fauzan, H., Ismail, M., Suhaila, A., Examining the key practices of human resource development (HRD), employees competencies (EC) and service performance (SP) among frontline employees of hotel industry: are they significantly related?

The lesson learnt can be captured through the formulation of strategy that needed to consider internal and external aspects. For example, as in the digital world, customer experience as well as customer satisfaction. Capability on the side of the network owned combined with network and social capabilities are expected to create distinctive organizational capability. Based on this background, the study aims to examine the effects of customer experience and distinctive organizational capability on the business model innovations of telecommunication firms in Indonesia using quantitative research. The target population are 445 telecommunication network companies in Indonesia which includes 312 ISP firms, 34 satellite firms, 27 tower firms, and 72 Telkom subsidiaries and affiliates, with samples taken from 34 firms. PLS is used as the analytical tool to process the data in this study. The results of the study show that customer experience and distinctive organizational capabilities have an influence to business model innovations. Customer experience has a bigger role than distinctive organizational capability in building business model innovation. These findings have practical implications for the management of telecommunications industries in Indonesia as the development of vocational training rely on the needs of business model innovation development, which directly based on the development of customer experience and supported with development of distinctive organizational capability. Further research can be explored by expanding the sample, industry and in other countries. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.","Business model innovation; Customer experience; Distinctive organization capability; Telecommunication industry",,,,,,,,"Abdelkafi, N., Makhotin, S., Posselt, T., Business Model Innovations for Electric Mobility — What Can Be Learned from Existing Business Model Patterns?

In doing so, the study has utilized the quarterly data of percentage of manufacturing covered by T&amp;C sector and CO2 per capita from the period of 1990–2018. The empirical investigation is carried out by applying the innovative Quantile-on-Quantile (QQ) regression and Granger causality in quantile methods. The findings of the study have identified the significant asymmetric behavior in the quantiles of T&amp;C industry on the quantiles of CO2 emission in the considered economies. Precisely, the outcomes have documented the significant positive contribution of T&amp;C manufacturing on CO2 emission in China, India, Pakistan, and Indonesia. On the other hand, the effect of T&amp;C on CO2 emission is negative in the case of Vietnam. As for causal relationships, the study also confirmed the presence of bi-directional causality between T&amp;C and CO2 emission in all countries except Indonesia, where the relationship is uni-directional. The study recommended regulators to introduce some incentives and subsidies for the new investors in T&amp;C industry with higher emphasis on green manufacturing. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Asian economies; CO2 emission; Quantile-on-Quantile; Textile & clothing","Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Green manufacturing; Tellurium compounds; Textiles; Asian economies; Asymmetric behaviors; Carbon dioxide emissions; Causal relationships; CO2 emissions; Empirical investigation; Quantile-on-Quantile; Textile and clothings; Industrial economics; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; environmental economics; industrial emission; manufacturing; quantitative analysis; regression analysis; textile industry; China; India; Indonesia; Pakistan; Viet Nam",,,,,,,"Akhtar, S., Baig, S.F., Saif, S., Mahmood, A., Ahmad, S.R., Five year carbon footprint of a textile industry: a podium to incorporate sustainability (2017) Nat Environ Pollut Technol, 16 (1), pp. 125-132; Zubair, M., Farid, M., Danish, M., Zafar, M.N., Evaluation of air pollution sources in selected zone of textile industries in pakistan (2017) Environ Eng Manag J (EEMJ), 16 (2); Parry, M., Parry, M.L., Canziani, O., Palutikof, J., Van der Linden, P., Hanson, C., (2007) Climate change 2007-impacts, adaptation and vulnerability: working group II contribution to the fourth assessment report of the IPCC, 4. , Cambridge University Press; Mia, R., Selim, M., Shamim, A.M., Review on various types of pollution problem in textile dyeing & printing industries of Bangladesh and recommandation for mitigation (2019) J Textile Eng Fashion Technol, 5 (4), pp. 220-226; USEPA, U.S. Environmental protection agency (2008), Quantifying Greenhouse gas emission working draft, 15-1; Ganesan, P., Thirugnanasambandam, M., Rajakarunakaran, S., Devaraj, D., Specific energy consumption and CO2 emission reduction analysis in a textile industry (2015) Int J Green Energy, 12 (7), pp. 685-693; Palamutcu, S., Electric energy consumption in the cotton textile processing stages (2010) Energy, 35 (7), pp. 2945-2952; Ozturk, H.K., Energy usage and cost in textile industry: a case study for Turkey (2005) Energy, 30 (13), pp. 2424-2446; Heo, Y.J., Seong, D.B., Park, S.J., Synthesis of polyethylenimine-impregnated titanate nanotubes for CO2 capture: influence of porosity and nitrogen content on amine-modified adsorbents (2019) J CO2 Util, 34, pp. 472-478; Zhang, L., Shen, Q., Wang, M., Sun, N., Wei, W., Lei, Y., Wang, Y., Driving factors and predictions of CO2 emission in China's coal chemical industry (2019) J Clean Prod, 210, pp. 1131-1140; Wang, H., Zhou, P., Xie, B.C., Zhang, N., Assessing drivers of CO2 emissions in China's electricity sector: a metafrontier production-theoretical decomposition analysis (2019) Eur J Oper Res, 275 (3), pp. 1096-1107; Shyam, S.S., Shridhar, N., Carbon emissions in Indian marine fisheries sector: cradle to grave analysis (2019) Clim Change, 5 (19), pp. 200-210; Ma, M., Cai, W., Do commercial building sector-derived carbon emissions decouple from the economic growth in Tertiary Industry?

The authors seek to examine the technological impact as part of digital transformation antecedents of CX and OA in developing DSI. The study also aims to investigate the digital transformation model to attain a more sustainableICT performance in Indonesia. The novelty of this study lies in the identifying and testing the concurrent effects of studied variables in improving the understanding of DSI and SP as part of the Indonesian ICT digital transformation model. The study used a sample of 195 Indonesia ICT firms. The finding from PLS-SEM reveals that GIS has a significant moderating role in accelerating the development ofDSI on the relationship with CX and OA, while SP is positively and significantly influenced by CS, OA and DSI. The implication and the proposed of digital transformation model for Indonesian ICT firms is also discussed in this paper. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Information services;

It was supported by the strength of existing firms, which is corporate reputation. The concept of co-creation-innovation itself is based on the theory of service dominant (S-D) logic. Past studies have focused on the critical elements of co-creation (CC) and digital service innovation (DSI), as well as corporate reputation (CR) in shaping a sustainable performance (SP). However, the study of co-creation-innovation and CR and its relationship to green environment has not been intensively explored. This study has aim to oversee the role of Green Information System (GIS; Green IS) in the development of corporate reputation and co-creation-innovation in order to attain sustainable performance. The study was conducted using a sample size of 195 respondents representing Indonesian telecommunication firms. Smart PLS was used as the statistical tool for analyses. Findings demonstrate that green IS directly and indirectly has a significant relationship on corporate reputation, CC and DSI. However, CR has a direct impact on CC but no direct impact on DSI.

Customer experience should become a key role in developing business model innovation in driving transformational performance. This paper argues that the transformational performance is derived from business model innovation and focuses on customer experience. We use telecommunication firms as our unit analysis with sample of 195 Indonesian ICT firms out of 542 units. The analytical approach and solution technique that is used for analysis is Partial Least Square (PLS). The findings demonstrate that business model played significant role on supporting contribution of customer experience in driving transformational performance. The finding has implication that by synergizing the value proposition of customer experience in a business model innovation, the transformational performance can be maintained through focus on customer experience driven business model innovation. Further study can be explored through additional variable, sample and further study on longitudinal on digital transformation firms. © 2020 by the authors.","Business Model Innovation; Customer experience; Industry 4.0; Transformational Performance",,,,,,,,"Amit, R., Zott, C., Value creation in e-business (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22, pp. 493-520; Amit, R., Zott, C., Business model innovation: Creating value in times of change (2010) Universia Business Review, 3. , https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1701660; Basceanu, L., (2014) Business Model Innovation and Value Co-Creation - Based on a Single Case Study on Liz Claiborne, , http://studenttheses.cbs.dk/bitstream/handle/10417/4570/lelia_ecaterina_basceanupdf.pdf?sequence=1, Retrieved from; Berman, S.J., Digital transformation: Opportunities to create new business models (2012) Strategy and Leadership, 40 (2), pp. 16-24; Bolton, R.N., (2016) Service Excellence: Creating Customer Experiences That Build Relationships, , http://www.ruthnbolton.com/Webinar160915_Bolton.pdf, N.

Therefore, the objective of the current study is to investigate the factors which limits the implementation of IoT. Additionally, the moderating role of employee innovative capabilities is also considered. A survey was carried out in the Indonesian engineering companies for data collection. Data collection was carried out form the employees of these companies. After data collection, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyse the data with the help of Partial Least Square (PLS). Findings of the study demonstrated that there are five key factors which effect the IoT implementation. These factors include; willingness to use, hardware characteristics, replacement of existing technology, failure threat and implementation cost. All these factors have the ability to influence IoT implementation. Additionally, employee innovative capability also has the ability to encourage or discourage the IoT implementation. Therefore, this study is most significant for the engineering industry of Indonesia as it provides the influencing factors towards IoT implementation. © 2020-IOS Press and the authors.","implementation; Industry 4.0; innovative capabilities; Internet of things (IoT); willingness to use","Data acquisition; Personnel; Engineering companies; Engineering industries; Hardware characteristics; Implementation cost; Innovative capability; Internet of Things (IOT); Partial least square (PLS); Structural equation modeling; Internet of things",,,,,,,"Radanliev, P., DeRoure, D.C., Nurse, J.R., Montalvo, R.M., Burnap, P., The industrial internet-of-Things in the industry 4. 0 supply chains of small and medium sized enterprises (2019) University of Oxford; Radanliev, P., (2019) New Developments in Cyber Physical Systems, the Internet of Things and the Digital Economy-discussion on Future Developments in the Industrial Internet of Things and Industry, 40; Chowdhury, A., Raut, S.A., Benefits, challenges, and opportunities in adoption of industrial iot (2019) International Journal of Computational Intelligence & IoT, 2 (4); Fernandez, F., Pallis, G.C., Opportunities and challenges of the internet of things for healthcare: Systems engineering perspective (2014) 2014 4th International Conference on Wireless Mobile Communication and Healthcare-Transforming Healthcare through Innovations in Mobile and Wireless Technologies (MOBIHEALTH, pp. 263-266; Bargshady, G., Alipanah, F., Abdulrazzaq, A.W., Chukwunonso, F., Business inteligence technology implimentation readiness factors (2014) Jurnal Teknologi, 68 (3); Curtis, M.B., Payne, E.A., An examination of contextual factors and individual characteristics affecting technology implementation decisions in auditing (2008) International Journal of Accounting Information Systems, 9 (2), pp. 104-121; Akman, G., Yilmaz, C., Innovative capability, innovation strategy and market orientation: An empirical analysis in Turkish software industry (2008) International Journal of Innovation Management, 12 (1), pp. 69-111; Rahmani, A.M., Exploiting smart e-health gateways at the edge of healthcare internet-of-Things: A fog computing approach (2018) Future Generation Computer Systems, 78, pp. 641-658; Santoro, G., Vrontis, D., Thrassou, A., Dezi, L., The internet of things: Building a knowledge management system for open innovation and knowledge management capacity (2018) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 136, pp. 347-354; Manogaran, G., Varatharajan, R., Lopez, D., Kumar, P.M., Sundarasekar, R., Thota, C., A new architecture of internet of things and big data ecosystem for secured smart healthcare monitoring and alerting system (2018) Future Generation Computer Systems, 82, pp. 375-387; Iftikhar, S., Saqib, A., Sarwar, M.R., Sarfraz, M., Arafat, M., Capacity and willingness to use information technology for managing chronic diseases among patients: A crosssectional study in lahore, Pakistan (2019) PloS One, 14 (1), p. 0209654; Beldad, A.D., Hegner, S.M., Expanding the technology acceptance model with the inclusion of trust, social influence, and health valuation to determine the predictors of German users' willingness to continue using a fitness app: A structural equation modeling approach (2018) International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 34 (9), pp. 882-893; Manis, K.T., Choi, D., The virtual reality hardware acceptance model (vr-ham): Extending and individuating the technology acceptance model (tam) for virtual reality hardware (2018) Journal of Business Research; Bi, Y., Gaillardon, P.-E., Hu, X.S., Niemier, M., Yuan, J.-S., Jin, Y., Leveraging emerging technology for hardware security-case study on silicon nanowire fets and graphene symfets (2014) 2014 Ieee 23rd Asian Test Symposium, pp. 342-347; Suryanegara, M., Arifin, A.S., Asvial, M., Ramli, K., Nashiruddin, M.I., Hayati, N., What are the Indonesian concerns about the internet of things (iot)?

Though there exists literature on the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) and pollution haven hypothesis (PHH), very few explore the scope in the light of Belt and Road host countries (B&amp;RCs). Therefore, the study examines the income-induced EKC and Chinese outward foreign direct investment (FDI)-based PHH in the multivariate framework of people’s connectivity and technology innovation in B&amp;RCs from 2003 to 2018. The outcome of the study reveals that the observed relationship is quantile-dependent, which may disclose misleading results in previous studies using traditional methodologies that address the averages. Utilizing the novel “Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR)” of Machado and Silva (J Econom 213:145–173, 2019), the findings confirm an inverted U-shape association between economic growth and CO2 emissions only at lower to medium emission countries, thus validating the EKC hypothesis. The Chinese outward FDI flows increase carbon emissions at medium to high emission countries, thereby confirming PHH. The findings also indicate that people’s connectivity contributes to increasing emissions while innovation mitigates carbon emissions at lower to medium polluted countries. Moreover, the outcomes of Granger causality confirm one-way causality between economic growth and CO2 emissions, between FDI and CO2 emissions, between people’s connectivity and CO2 emissions, and between innovation and CO2 emissions. The results offer valuable insight for legislators to counteract CO2 emissions in B&amp;RCs through innovation-led energy conservation in infrastructure projects while adopting green and sustainable financing mechanisms to materialize mega construction projects under the BRI. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Belt and Road Initiative; Environmental Kuznets Curve; Innovation; Method of Moments Quantile Regression; People’s Connectivity; Pollution haven hypothesis",,,,,"71703013

We argue that the concept of strategy has shifted from the competitive strategy into co-creation strategy based on collaboration value. In developing co-creation strategy, the input is derived from external factors associated with customer experience and internal factors related to distinctive capabilities and both focus on core competence development in supply chain management. We use telecommunication firms as our unit analysis with sample of 35 Indonesian Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) firms analysed using Partial Least Square (PLS). The findings show that the developing of co-creation strategy was supported by distinctive capabilities and customer experience. The findings also indicate that co-creation strategy emerges as a key in sustaining business of the firms to focus on developing customer experience and providing distinctive capabilities. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Co-creation strategy; Customer experience; Distinctive capabilities; Supply chain",,,,,,,,"Bolton, R.N., (2016) Service Excellence: Creating Customer Experiences that Build Relationships.

Due to various issues like gender discrimination, women's self-sustainability is quite low, and this accounts for the negligible contribution of women in Pakistan's economy (up to 20 to 25%). In addressing this issue, the current study adopted a quantitative research approach and cross-sectional research design. By using a survey questionnaire, data were collected from female clients of microfinance institutions during May 1, 2018 to August 30, 2018. SmartPLS 3 was utilized to analyse the data. The results of the inquiry revealed that microfinance institutions have an essential role to play in promoting women's self-reliance. With the help of micro-enterprises for women, services offered by microfinance institution such as micro-credit, micro-savings, micro-insurance, micro-training and social capital have a major role in developing women's self-sustainability. However, an environmental disaster is one of the crucial factors, which limits the positive contribution of microfinance institutions towards women's self-sustainability. Our thorough research and knowledge on the subject indicates that the current study is the pioneer study that has investigated microfinance institutions as major facilitators of women's self-reliance but which has been limited by many factors such as environmental disasters. Hence, the current study appears salient for microfinance institutions, the government of Pakistan and other practitioners that desire to boost women's self-sustainability. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","An environmental disaster; gender mainstreaming; microfinance; women micro-enterprise success; women' self-sustainability",,,,,,,,"Akanji, O., Microfinance as a strategy for poverty reduction (2006) Central Bank of Nigeria Economic and Financial Review, 39 (4), pp. 111-134; Al-Shami, S.S.A., Razali, M.M., Majid, I., Rozelan, A., Rashid, N., The effect of microfinance on women's empowerment: Evidence from Malaysia (2016) Asian Journal of Women's Studies, 22 (3), pp. 318-337; Amudha, R., Selvabaskar, S., Motha, L.C.S., Micro-insurance: A mechanism for women empowerment through self help group linked LIC (2014) 2014 International Conference on Science Engineering and Management Research (ICSEMR), pp. 1-3. , United States, IEEE; Atmadja, A.S., Su, J.-J., Sharma, P., Examining the impact of microfinance on microenterprise performance (implications for women-owned microenterprises in Indonesia) (2016) International Journal of Social Economics, 43 (10), pp. 962-981; Babajide, A.A., Effects of microfinance on micro and small enterprises (MSEs) growth in Nigeria (2012) Asian Economic and Financial Review, 2 (3), pp. 463-477; Bacon, D.R., Sauer, P.L., Young, M., Composite reliability in structural equations modeling (1995) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 55 (3), pp. 394-406; Bali Swain, R., Floro, M., Microfinance, vulnerability and risk in low income households (2014) International Review of Applied Economics, 28 (5), pp. 539-561; Bali Swain, R., Wallentin, F.Y., Factors empowering women in Indian self-help group programs (2012) International Review of Applied Economics, 26 (4), pp. 425-444; Banerjee, S.B., Jackson, L., Microfinance and the business of poverty reduction: Critical perspectives from rural Bangladesh (2017) Human Relations, 70 (1), pp. 63-91; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator–mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51 (6), pp. 1173-1182; Bateman, M., (2010) Why doesn't microfinance work?: The destructive rise of local neoliberalism, , London, United Kingdom, Zed Books Ltd; Becker, J., Kovach, A.C., Gronseth, D.L., Individual empowerment: How community health workers operationalize self-determination, self-sufficiency, and decision-making abilities of low-income mothers (2004) Journal of Community Psychology, 32 (3), pp. 327-342; Bernard, D.K., Kevin, L.L.T., Khin, A.A., Entrepreneurial success through microfinance services among women entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka: A pilot study and overview of the findings (2016) International Journal of Economics and Financial Issues, 6 (3), pp. 1144-1150; Bhukuth, A., Roumane, A., Terrany, B., Cooperative, human capital and poverty: A theoretical framework (2018) Economics & Sociology, 11 (2), pp. 11-18; Birkmann, J., Measuring vulnerability to promote disaster-resilient societies: Conceptual frameworks and definitions (2006) Measuring Vulnerability to Natural Hazards: Towards Disaster Resilient Societies, 1, pp. 9-54; Blaikie, P., Cannon, T., Davis, I., Wisner, B., (2004) At risk: Natural hazards, people's vulnerability and disasters, , Abingdon, UK, Routledge; Boholm, Å., Corvellec, H., A relational theory of risk (2011) Journal of Risk Research, 14 (2), pp. 175-190; Bosma, N.S., Levie, J., (2010) Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2009 Executive Report; Bourdieu, P., (2003) Firing back: Against the tyranny of the market 2 (Vol. 2), , Brooklyn, New York, Verso; Buckley, G., Microfinance in Africa: Is it either the problem or the solution?

For a country like Singapore, which has shown a radical growth and is known for its population density, it is important to explore the role of green technology innovation in the pursuit of economic excellence with the least possible cost to the environment. By employing the novel bootstrap autoregressive-distributed lag (BARDL) technique using a time series data from 1990 to 2018, the results reported a positive and significant relationship of green technology innovation with economic growth and negative and significant relationship with carbon emissions in both long run and short run.

Hence, the motivation of this study is to design an auxiliary tri-generation system for a ship based on exhaust gases from its engine and implement the smart use technique of the waste heat. Thermodynamic and exergoeconomic analyses are conducted to evaluate the proposed system considering acceptable thermodynamic assumptions. The system consists of a Kalina cycle, an ejector-booster refrigeration cycle, and a humidification dehumidification desalination unit for power, cooling, and freshwater production. A parametric analysis is conducted to illustrate the effect of some design variables on the sum unit cost of products. Also, to achieve the best design of the system, different optimized cases are evaluated based on a genetic algorithm. According to the attained results, employing exhaust gases from a ship's engine through the proposed tri-generation system enhanced the thermodynamic and cost outcomes. So, this is a cost-effective and clean production solution to improve the design of a ship. Considering the multi-objective optimization, energy and exergy efficiencies and the sum unit cost of products were 81%, 49%, and 78.6 $/GJ, correspondingly. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Desalination; Exergoeconomic; Kalina cycle; Optimization; Ship's engine; Tri-generation","Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Desalination; Exhaust gases; Genetic algorithms; Humidity control; Multiobjective optimization; Product design; Refrigeration; Ships; Waste heat; Clean production; Desalination units; Energy and exergy efficiency; Environmental problems; Exergoeconomic analysis; Humidification-dehumidification; Parametric -analysis; Refrigeration cycles; Exhaust systems (engine)",,,,,"All authors dedicate this paper to Karabakh.

Digital technology has become an enabler in the innovation of business models. New capabilities are required to be developed, especially for incumbent firms, since new entries have more agility in establishing new business models to create value. Even though the incumbent firms have strong reputation, they need to develop new distinct capabilities to create value in the long run. The fastest way to develop new capabilities is through collaboration also known as co-creation. Co-creation is a form of economic strategy to bring mutual values from different parties as a mediating role in creating business model innovations. Since there are limited study on co-creation strategy in relation to corporate reputation and business model innovation, this paper aims to assess the mediating role of co-creation strategy on the relationship between business model innovation and corporate reputation. The unit of analysis is taken from Indonesian telecommunication firms with sample of 35 firms out of 445 firms using purposive sampling method. Smart PLS (Partial Least Square) is used as the analytical approach and solution in the study. Research results reveal that corporate reputation has an indirect effect on business model innovation, but a direct effect on co-creation strategy.

The way organizations manage resources and capability, especially in relationship with people, culture and process in creating new business models have changed. Previous studies on developing innovation based on customer experience and agility of organization focus on the concept, relationship among variables and the implication. However, in the context of industry 5.0, the study on those topics has not been revealing. Hence, this study aims to assess the concept of experience-agility innovation model to support transformation in the context of digital transformation to face Industry 5.0. The proposed model was assessed with 195 Indonesia ICT firms using SEM-PLS statistical tools. The findings demonstrate that the firm that offers compelling value proposition from customer experience while concurrently developing agility in the organization to create business model innovation could boost the transformational performance. For further researches, the study can be enhanced through expanding the model, sample, and time. © BEIESP.","Business model innovation; Customer experience; Industry 5.0; Organizational agility; Transformational performance",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, MHE&SR

Sustainable values through co-creation involve crucial stakeholders, especially customers, organizations, and social communities to maximise the captured total value. Past studies have explored the concept, system and role of those stakeholders, however the sustainability of co-creation in the digital era has not been covered. Therefore, this paper aims to provide an understanding of the key concepts and models that would support practitioners in building sustainable innovation-driven digital co-creation. The study was conducted using 195 samples representing Indonesian ICT firms. Findings demonstrate that digital co-creation plays a significant role as an intervening variable in the relationship between customer experience orientation, social community, and organization agility and transformational performance. ©BEIESP.","Customer experience orientation; Digital co-creation; Organizational agility; Social community; Sustainability",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, MHE&SR

The platform service becomes critical in order to collaborate and innovate based on organizational agility and customer experience. Co-creation-driven innovation is considered as part of the service dominant development, where a dynamic organization model and customer experience feedback are required in the shaping of business model innovations within the digital ecosystem. The study was performed with a sample size of 175 respondents representing Indonesian telecommunication firms. Smart PLS was used as the statistical tool for analyses. Findings demonstrate that customer experience orientation and organizational agility has a direct impact on digital co-creation and business model innovation. Simultaneous testing of hypotheses shows that customer experience orientation has an indirect influence on business model innovation through co-creation strategy. However, organizational agility does not have any indirect impacts. The study has some limitations in terms of the time period and sample size, therefore suggestions for future studies are included in the paper. © BEIESP.","Business model innovation; Customer experience orientation; Digital co-creation; Organizational agility; Service dominant logic",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, MHE&SR

Data were collected from managers working in Malaysian SMEs. A total of 384 questionnaires was finally used for analysis using SmartPLS 3.8.2. Area cluster sampling was used for data collection, and seven out of sixteen clusters were selected randomly. These included Selangor, Johor, Kuala Lumpur, Sabah, Penang, Sarawak, and Perak because these seven states cover 73.9% of total SMEs. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the hypotheses. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was also used to examine the reliability and validity, and structural model assessment was used to test the relationship between variables. Findings revealed that an MCS package had a positive influence on a firm's sustainability, cost leadership, and differentiation strategy. Moreover, cost leadership and differentiation strategy have a significant and positive influence on a firm's sustainability. In addition, cost leadership strategies and differentiation strategies significantly mediate between the MCS package and a firm's sustainability. This research assesses the influence of the MCS package through cost leadership and differentiation strategy on a firm's sustainability of Malaysian SMEs. It helps top management to focus on the MCS package and business strategies in attaining a firm's long-term sustainability. Finally, research recommendations discuss that the present study helps future researchers and academicians. © 2019 by the authors.","Cost leadership strategy; Differentiation strategy; Firm sustainability; MCS package",,,,,,"This research received no external funding",,"Heinicke, A., Performance measurement systems in small and medium-sized enterprises and family firms: A systematic literature review (2018) J.

Hence, this paper examines the roles of digital leadership in developing strategic alliance and dynamic capability based on the market orientation. It is put forward that digital leadership behaviors have a stronger influence on the development of strategic alliance in order to drive dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. A quantitative method was used, comprising 88 senior leaders of Indonesian telecommunication companies. Purposive sampling method was used with the Smart PLS statistical tool. The findings confirm the direct and indirect significant effects between digital leadership and the development of strategic alliance and dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. The study has practical implications to take priority in developing digital leadership to enforce the transformation. The limitations of the study are identified to be the sample, time and statistical tool used, hence longitudinal study is suggested in the future with a more extended sample quantity and time frame. © 2019, Czestochowa University of Technology.

The current business model innovation generally fails to sufficiently embrace the sustainability dimension, especially in relation with organization agility and customer experience orientation. This paper assesses the relationship TP with business model innovation (BMI), organizational agility (OA), operational efficiency (OE), and customer experience orientation (CEO) in the Indonesian ICT Industry toward sustainability development. The study used purposive sampling using sample of 195 out of a population of 542. The collected data was then analyzed using Smart PLS. Findings of the study shows that OA has directly influence to TP while CEO and OA, has an indirect significant influence on TP through BMI, but OE has no direct and indirect influence on TP. Findings of the study has implications on strengthening the transformation model based on OA and CEO toward sustainability development, while OE is found as critical part in developing BMI. © 2019, Czestochowa University of Technology.

The collaboration with customers is also known as co-creation strategy and predominantly drives transformational performance. Transformational performance is based on performance management theory and transformation paradigms. However, its development to ensure the works of co-creation strategy, based on customer experience, remains unclear. To address this gap the digital transformational model based on co-creation strategy, with a focus on customer experience, was investigated to accelerate transformational performance. This study uses quantitative research, with a sample of 35 representatives from telecommunication firms. The findings demonstrate that co-creation strategy significantly supports customer experience, in driving transformational performance. Customer experience also appears to significantly impact co-creation strategy indirectly. The findings have theoretical implications for the emergence of collaboration strategy in the disruptive era. They show practitioners how co-creation strategy is becoming key in sustaining the business, as it shifts the focus onto the development of customer experience to drive transformational performance.

The market has become more dynamic due to new business model innovations offered by new entries in the industry. Incumbent firms require a digital transformation in order to have a more dynamic capability in shaping their existing business to fit the new paradigm. The fastest way of developing capabilities to align with the new paradigm is through collaboration with partners. Developing capabilities for innovation management and dynamic capabilities requires strong digital leadership to optimize the use of digital technology. The need for collaboration is urgent to accelerate the development process of innovation in the digital era, therefore, this study uses collaboration as its moderating variable. Most published research focusing on digital transformation examines digital leadership, innovation dynamic capabilities based on construct, applicability and benefit, and the role of collaboration. However, the role of digital leadership in driving innovation management and dynamic capability has not been intensively explored nor specifically the influence of collaboration. This study was conducted through a survey of 88 senior leader respondents from Indonesian telecommunication firms using a purposive sampling method. The statistical data was processed using Smart-PLS application for analyses. Findings demonstrate that innovation management moderated by collaboration had a significant influence in accelerating the relationship between digital leadership and dynamic capabilities. It is also found that digital leadership had a direct and indirect impact on the development of dynamic capability. This indicates that digital leadership actually had a strong role in driving the transformation. These findings have practical implications to support the theory that collaboration is a critical factor in the digital era. It supports the role of firm management in strengthening digital leadership capabilities in conjunction with the development of innovation management with a focus on co-creation values in developing dynamic capabilities. Recommendation for further research is also discussed in this paper. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Collaboration; Digital leadership; Dynamic capability; Innovation management",,,,,,,,"Al-Debei, M.M., The Design and Engineering of Innovative Mobile Data Services: An Ontological Framework Founded on Business Model Thinking (2010) Engineering, p. 288; Barney, J., Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Berman, S.J., Digital transformation: Opportunities to create new business models (2012) Strategy and Leadership, 40 (2), pp. 16-24. , https://doi.org/10.1108/10878571211209314; Bessant, J., Phillips, W., (2013) Innovation management and dynamic capability The Sage Handbook of Strategic Supply Manage-Ment: Relationships, Chains, Networks and Sectors, , http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/12488%5Cn; Bhattarai, K., Carter, M., An Empirical Analysis of the Taylor Rule and its Application to Monetary Policy: A Case for the United Kingdom and Euro Area (2018) Asian Journal of Economics and Empirical Research, 5 (2), pp. 173-182; Bhuia, M.R., Das, S., Rahman, K., Alam, K., Kawsar, L.A., Hossain, M., An Assessment of the Importance of Admission Test for Enrollments in Public Universities of Bangladesh (2016) Journal of Education and e-Learning Research, 3 (1), pp. 9-16; Bourne, M., Neely, A., Implementing Performance Measurement Systems: a literature review (2003), 5 (1), pp. 1-24; Carayannis, E.G., Sindakis, S., Walter, C., Business Model Innovation as Lever of Organizational Sustainability (2015) Journal of Technology Transfer, 40 (1), pp. 85-104; Chesbrough, H., Open Innovation: Where We've Been and Where We're Going (2012) Research-Technology Management, 55 (4), pp. 20-27; Cockburn, T., Smith, P.A.C., VUCA and the power of Emergence Teams.

The collaboration, service orientation, agility and customer experience become a critical in this dynamic environment. Hence, the firm strategy has shifted from a competition strategy to a col-laboration strategy. Collaboration with customers is effected through co-creation Strategy (CCS). It could enable the firms in accelerating digital transformation. This study of the development of co-creation strategy focuses on customer experience orientation (CXO) and organization agility (OA) to support transformational performance (TP) in terms of relationship among variables and an empirical study has been conducted. Hence, in this paper, we propose a model of digital transformation for ICT Industry based on co-creation of strategy focused on customer experience orientation and organization agility. The study is based on an empirical study of 195 Indonesian ICT firms. The findings from this analysis reveal the concept of Service Dominant logic (S-D Logic) where the Co-creation capability and organizational agilities can suffice. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Co creation strategy; Customer experience orientation; Organization agility; Transformational performance",,,,,,,,"Bello, H.Y., Jikan-Jatum, A.M., Inuwa, N., An Appraisal of Socio-Economic Impacts of Commercial Motorcyles in Gombe State, Nigeria (2017) International Journal of Asian Social Science, 7 (6), pp. 480-488; Bessie, S., Beyene, F., Hundie, B., Goshu, D., Mulatu, Y., Land use/land cover change and its effects on bamboo forest in benishangul gumuz region, Ethiopia (2016) International Journal of Sustainable Development & World Policy, 5 (1), pp. 1-11; Chakravarty, A., Grewal, R., Sambamurthy, V., Information technology competencies, organizational agility, and firm performance (2013) Information Systems Research, 24 (4), pp. 976-997; Dean, A.M., Griffin, M., Kulczynski, A., Applying Service Logic to Education: The Co-creation Experience and Value Outcomes (2016) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 224, pp. 325-331. , August 2015; Fatma, S., Antecedents and Consequences of Customer Experience Management-A Literature Review and Research Agenda (2014) International Journal of Business and Commerce, 3 (6), pp. 32-49; Frow, P., Nenonen, S., Payne, A., Storbacka, K., Managing Co-creation Design: A Strategic Approach to Innovation (2015) British Journal of Management, 26 (3), pp. 463-483; Hamidi, F., Shams Gharneh, N., Impact of co-creation on innovation capability and firm performance: a structural equation modeling (2017) AD-Minister, pp. 73-90. , (june); Hemel, C., Rademakers, M.F., Building Customer-centric Organizations: Shaping Factors and Barriers (2016) Journal of Creating Value, 2 (2), pp. 211-230; Loss, L., Crave, S., Agile Business Models: an Approach to support collaborative networks (2011) Production Planning & Control, 22 (5-6), pp. 571-580; Lusch, R.F., Vanco, L., Service-Dominant Logic What It Is, What It Is Not, What It Might Be (2006) In The service dominant logic of marketing: Dialog, debate and directions, pp. 43-56; Mihardjo, L.W.W., Alamsjah, F., Elidjen, E., Sasmoko, S., Digital Transformation in the Age of Industry 4 (2018) 0: Acceleration of Transformational Performance through Business Model Innovation and Co-Creation Strategy in Indonesian ICT Firms Transformación digital en la era de la industria 4. 0: Aceleración del.

Hence, the purpose of this paper is to examine what are the roles of digital leadership in developing strategic alliance and dynamic capability based on market orientation. We argue that digital leadership behaviors have a stronger influence on the development of strategic alliance to drive dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. A quantitative method is used comprising 88 senior leaders of Indonesian telecommunication. The purposive sampling methods is used with the statistical tool is Smart PLS. The findings confirm the significant influence directly and indirectly between digital leadership and the development of strategic alliance and dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. The study has practical implication to take the priority in developing of digital leadership in enforcing the transformation. the limitations of study could be identified as the sample, time and used statistical tools, hence the further study can be extended in term of sample quantity, time horizon to become longitudinal research. © 2019, Dorma Journals.

In doing so, the authors seek to examine the technological antecedents of customer experience (CUE) by examining the role of green information systems (GIS) and service innovation (SEI). Moreover, the study also aims to investigate the association of SEI and GIS with customer satisfaction (CUS) and hotels environmental performance (ENP). The novelty of the present study lies in identifying and testing the joint effects of the studied variables in improving the understanding of CUS and ENP in an existing complex environment. The results of PLS-SEM confirm that customer experience and ENP have a positive and significantly influenced by the GIS. Moreover, the results further suggested that customer experience and CUS have significantly and positively impacted by SEI. Finally, the results of PLS-SEM confirm that ENP and CUS have significantly and positively impacted by customer experience in multinational firms in Indonesia. © 2019, Econjournals.

The Indonesian market is unique in terms of its ICT infrastructure, but still left behind compared to other countries. However, the market has tremendous opportunities in terms of digital capability innovations. The strategic management outline used as a framework for this paper. Mediating variables were co-creation strategies and business innovations with distinctive organisational capability as an internal factor and consumer orientation as the external independent factor. The construct of co-creation strategy and transformational performance were discussed. This model of digital transformation was a suitable model for senior leaders to transform digital business capability and academics. Moreover, the model and construct of variable can be used to further develop the theory of digital transformation.

In addition to that moderating role of mutual trust is also examined. The study has broached the argument that knowledge sharing and transformational leadership style improves team performance. Findings of the current study suggest creativity is a process that starts in the team through the sharing of knowledge. The currents study is also of the view that the that the process of creativity starts in the situation when the team members share knowledge through coordination and it is also argued that the much of the knowledge is shared when team members meet to share knowledge in a given area, much of which is tacit. Sharing such tacit knowledge creates a flow of novel ideas that contribute to successful outcomes, such as new products, processes and patents. The findings of the study have shown agreement with the proposed or hypothesize results. The study has used PLS-SEM to analyses the data. The study will be helpful for policy makers in the researcher in understanding the issues related to supply chain, its integration, flexibility, and internal performance. © 2019, General Jonas Zemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania.","knowledge sharing; Leadership; Transformational",,,,,,,,"Avolio, B.J., Bass, B.M., Individual consideration viewed at multiple levels of analysis: A multi-level framework for examining the diffusion of transformational leadership (1995) The Leadership Quarterly, 6 (2), pp. 199-218. , https://doi.org/10.1016/1048-9843(95)90035-7; Basheer, M., Siam, M., Awn, A., Hassan, S., Exploring the role of TQM and supply chain practices for firm supply performance in the presence of information technology capabilities and supply chain technology adoption: A case of textile firms in Pakistan (2019) Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 7 (2), pp. 275-288. , https://doi.org/10.5267/j.uscm.2018.9.001; Bock, G.W., Kim, Y.-G., Breaking the myths of rewards: An exploratory study of attitudes about knowledge sharing (2002) Information Resources Management Journal (IRMJ), 15 (2), pp. 14-21. , https://doi.org/10.4018/irmj.2002040102; Burke, C.S., Sims, D.E., Lazzara, E.H., Salas, E., Trust in leadership: A multi-level review and integration (2007) The Leadership Quarterly, 18 (6), pp. 606-632. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2007.09.006; Casimir, G., Lee, K., Loon, M., Knowledge sharing: influences of trust, commitment and cost (2012) Journal of Knowledge Management, 16 (5), pp. 740-753. , https://doi.org/10.1108/13673271211262781; Cerneviciute, J., Strazdas, R., Teamwork management in Creative industries: factors influencing productivity (2018) Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Issues, 6 (2), pp. 503-516. , http://doi.org/10.9770/jesi.2018.6.2(3); Cheng, W., Hailin, L., Hongming, X., Does knowledge sharing mediate the relationship between trust and firm performance?

To address this purpose, business firms from Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore are selected with a sample of 10 firms in each state over 2012 to 2016. Multiple regression technique is applied to analyze the relationship between financial ratios and stock prices. It is observed that current ratio, quick ratio, assets growth, return on assets, return on equity, return on capital employed, and price to earning ratio are significant determinants of stock price. Although this study is a reasonable addition in existing literature of financial ratios as determinants of stock price. However, contribution of the study can be viewed through covering a gap from the context of ASEAN region, which is under reserachers attentions for stock price determinants. Core limitations of the study covers limited number of sample size and five years of time duration. Besides, some ratios are missing which can be reconsidered in upcoming studies. These ratios include debt ratios, interest payment ratios, and fixed cost covered ratios as well. © 2019, General Jonas Zemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania.","ASEAN; Assets growth; Financial ratios;

The digital transformation is required by incumbent to develop innovation on product and service business model based on customer experience orientation. To support this transformation, strong digital leader is important to assure the development of this transformation. The study on the role of digital leadership on business model innovation and customer experience has not been explored, significantly, Hence, this research aims at assessing the role of digital leadership, whether it directly or indirectly influences the customer experience orientation in developing business model innovation. This study was conducted through survey to 88 senior leader respondents from Indonesia telecommunication firms, in which Smart-PLS application was used to analyze the data. The result show that digital leadership had direct and indirect impacts on customer experience orientation in developing business model innovation. The practical implications of these findings are recommended for the senior leader of management of telecommunications industries in Indonesia to strengthen digital leadership capability in conjunction with the development of business model innovation and customer experience orientation.

The capabilities can be fostered when the leader is oriented towards digital technology and market orientation. The role of digital leadership has gained attention for studies to develop innovation and dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. Studies have been conducted on dynamic capabilities with focus on the strategy, management and economic literature including the understanding of its driving key to success. However, the study on the role of digital leadership on the development of dynamic capability based on innovation capability and market orientation has not been intensively discussed. It is argued that the development of dynamic capability and innovation capability is strongly driven from a combination of digital leadership and market orientation. Data in this study is taken from a survey conducted on 88 Indonesian telecommunication firms as a unit for analyses. The results show that digital leadership had a strong direct and indirect relationship with dynamic capability, however the strong path in developing capability is determined from the development of innovation capability that is driven from digital leadership based on market orientation. The finding reinforces the role of digital leadership as a critical influence on development of dynamic capability. Future studies are suggested to extend the research by exploring the research model to elaborate more on the impact of collaboration, leveraging a larger sample size and better statistical tools. A longitudinal study on the companies that implement the transformation based on dynamic capabilities is also recommended for future studies. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

Digital leadership will significantly enable sensing market changes, seizing opportunities, and reconfiguring organizations. Previous studies on digital leadership, dynamic capability, and innovation management focus mainly on constructs, benefits, and implications. However, a study on the role of digital leadership based on dynamic capability in fostering innovation and the impact of market orientation have not been thoroughly explored, which is the aim of this study, taking market orientation as a moderating variable. Employing a quantitative methodology, data were collected through online questionnaires, distributed through email and messaging applications to a purposive sample of 88 senior managers of Indonesian telecommunication firms. The results reveal that digital leadership based on dynamic capability impacts directly and indirectly on developing innovation. Market orientation also plays an important role in accelerating innovation. Due to limitations in terms of research model, sample size, and time, further research using larger samples in other industries and countries should be undertaken. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Digital leadership; Dynamic capability; Innovation management; Market orientation; Transformation model",,,,,,,,"Abiodun, B.Y., The Prospects of Accounting and Economic Systems in the Era of Global Knowledge Economy (2014) The Economics and Finance Letters, 1 (2), pp. 9-14; Ahmed, A., Rehan, R., Chhapra, I.U., Supro, S., Interest Rate and Financial Performance of Banks in Pakistan (2018) International Journal of Applied Economics, Finance and Accounting, 2 (1), pp. 1-7; Ali, A., Haseeb, M., Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology as a strategic tool towards higher performance of supply chain operations in textile and apparel industry of Malaysia (2019) Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 7 (2), pp. 215-226; Amfo, P., Cudjoe, G., Acheampong, G., Adams, M., Boakye, E., Market Orientation, Innovation and Business Performance: Insight from Womenpreneurs in the Fashion Industry in Ghana Market Orientation (2018) Journal of Creativity and Business Innovation, 4. , April; Arief, M., Basuki, Y.T., Dynamic capability as a business strategy enhancing the business performance (A conceptual approach) (2015) Advanced Science Letters, 21 (4), pp. 690-694; Basuki, Y.T., Arief, M., Propheto, A., The role of leadership, dynamic capabilities, and organization culture, in company performance of manufacturing industries in Indonesia (Study in food and beverages industries) (2015) Advanced Science Letters, 21 (5), pp. 1141-1145; Berman, S.J., Marshall, A., The next digital transformation: From an individual-centered to an everyone-to-everyone economy (2014) Strategy and Leadership, 42 (5), pp. 9-17; Bessant, J., Phillips, W., Innovation management and dynamic capability (2013) The Sage Handbook of Strategic Supply Manage-Ment: Relationships, Chains, Networks and Sectors, , http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/12488%5Cnhttp://www.sagepub.com/books/Book229482, Retrieved from; Breznik, L., Hisrich, R.D., Dynamic capabilities vs. Innovation capability: Are they related?

Methods: This secondary research collected data from macroeconomic and AI-specific data sets. The sources of data from which insights were gained included digital technology sectors and corporations and their functions. The focus was on the need to assess the capability of AI on business operations The macroeconomic data was collected from data resources of international organizations’ including the World Economic Forum, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). In addition, this study has considered 19 economic indicators to analyze the economic outcome of AI in selected economies of Asia-Pacific. Results: From the results, the period between 2014 and 2016 witnessed China leading with over 25,000 citable documents on the AI topic. Regarding institutions that were observed to publish over 500 times on the AI topic, the countries in the ascending order include China (600), Hong Kong (1,100), and Singapore (2,000). As such, this study established that Asia-Pacific economies such as Hong Kong and Singapore though have smaller populations, but the majority of their higher education institutions have made a significant contribution to AI research; with the small economies also having a relatively higher number of computer scientists among the top 1,000 individuals. Additionally, through empirically analyses, during 1998–2016 with annual observations, it is found that various economic outcomes of AI were presented in 8 economies of targeted region. Limitations: At first, the future outlook of AI is just discussed in conceptual meaning while empirical context still needs to be examined in upcoming studies. At second, covering the overall South Asian region provides better findings with more generalization which is missing in current research. At third, other dimensions of AI and economy like implication of AI impact index and its relationship with macroeconomic variables is also missing in current research which could be reconsidered in coming studies. Conclusion: It is evident that AI exhibits the potential to be the main driver of Asia-Pacific’s economic growth. Relative to the net and gross effect of AI on labor markets and the gross domestic product (GDP) of the top Asia-Pacific economies demonstrate that by 2030, AI might yield a 16-percent increase in output, translating into an estimated amount of $13 trillion. Overall, it is concluded that Asia-Pacific, when compared to developed regions such as North America, is lagging but the availability of a large pool of user data implies that the region can move ahead—given better resource and talent allocation. © 2019 The Authors.

This paper has the objective to provide the antecedents of business model innovation and compare the effects of corporate reputation and distinctive organizational capability in developing business model innovation. The study is based on the digital disruption phenomenon, where established companies are disrupted by the new entries with the new business model that leverages digital capability. The study focuses on information, communication and technology (ICT) of the incumbent companies in developing business model innovations as the second curve in sustaining the business. The ICT industry is an important sector in the development of other industries and has a significant influence on economic growth, which currently relies on emerging markets such as Indonesia. The Indonesian ICT market has unique characteristics where innovation grows rapidly, but infrastructure lacks behind and the market is very competitive. This creates a gap between innovation opportunities and development of digital infrastructure. As for the incumbent firms, the mitigation of risks of the investment of ICT infrastructure and competition with new entries with their new business model and market. Incumbent firms still have the advantage of corporate reputation and are required to develop distinctive capability. However, the study of developing business model innovations for incumbent firms in the market with a focus on corporate reputation is still limited. The current study is an empirical study using a sample of 35 Indonesian ICT firms. Smart Partial Least Square (SmartPLS) is the analytical approach and solution technique used in the study. Research findings show that the distinctive organization capability has more influence compared to corporate reputation in developing business model innovations. The study implicates on the theory that the development of business model innovations should focus on distinctive organization capabilities rather than relying more heavily on corporate reputation. This means that ICT Incumbent firms are required to transform their capabilities to align with market changes. In terms of management, the study also implicates the urgency in developing distinctive organizational capabilities in respective units, especially in intangible assets. Further research can be explored by expanding the research sample and industry conducting longitudinal study on the transformational model of incumbent firms. © 2018, Universidad del Zulia.

This paper aims to discuss how ICT firms could manage the transformational performance by integrating business model innovations and co-creation strategy. The construction model of transformational performance and co-creation strategy is expected to contribute to the theory of performance and co-creation reviewed in literatures based on the Indonesian ICT phenomenon. Indonesia’s ICT Industry has gained the attention to be studied since it is one of the emerging markets with unique market characteristics with numerous opportunities but lacking the digital infrastructure. The digital transformation is required for firms to be able to sustain their business. Measurement on the success of implementing the transformation is one of the key success factors. The construction of the transformational performance variable is driven from the theory of quality management, balance scorecards and digital maturity. The construct could contribute as a reference model to track the firms’ transformational performance. In digital transformation and disruptive era, business models and co-creation are key factors to drive performance. Co-creation is one of the business model innovations that is done through collaboration and partnerships. It is also an integrated strategy used in order to perform in the market. To elaborate the model, we develop a prototype using a sample of 35 senior leaders from Indonesian ICT firms. Partial Least Square (PLS) is the statistical tool used to analyze the data foo this study. The findings show that a firm’s transformational performance is significantly influenced by business model innovations and co-creation strategy. Further findings show that in digital transformation, a firm cannot fulfill all core capabilities as it requires collaboration and crowd sourcing. Our selected examples are only prototypes of the research model and implications of this study are limited to their particular context. Ultimately, our research model requires further research and validation, which should be done in future studies. © 2018, Universidad del Zulia.

The XGBoost method did not have optimal accuracy in providing product recommendations. This study aims to improve the product recommendation system using the XGBoost method by combining it with the K-Means method and clickstream data. As the results, these two contributions were able to improve the accuracy of the product recommendation system with an accuracy value of 95.72%, a precision value of 95.93%, a recall value of 95.72%, and an f-1 score of 95.80%. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Each year, e-commerce business increasingly popular. Some retail companies finally decided to focus on internet-based sales to get more customers. Along with transactions that continue to be carried out from year to year, transaction data continues to be stored and stacked and of course space consuming. So after years, Business Intelligence is finally appeared and offer great data processing. Without a business intelligence, these stacked big data are useless and wait to be removed because of poor knowledge. Business intelligence turns on the poor knowledge data into rich knowledge data visualization. This paper proposed a data warehouse that can be used to build a business intelligent with utilize information obtained from the history of transactions. To build up this business intelligent, authors uses methodology steps by Kimball which consists 4 steps of dimensional design process. Furthermore, data analysis will be presented in a dashboard using Power BI. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data handling; Data warehouses; Electronic commerce; Information analysis; Risk management; Sales; Surveys; Systems engineering; Business intelligent; Dimensional design; E retails; E-commerce business; Internet based; Transaction data; US dollar; Data visualization",,,,,"Abdullah, L., Ramli, R., Bakodah, H., Othman, M., (2019) Journal of King Saud University Computer and Information Sciences; Diwandari, S., Permanasari, A.E., Hidayah, I., (2018) Journal of ICT Research and Applications, 12, pp. 54-69; Gang, T., Kai, C., Bei, S., (2008) IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics; Kocakoçy, I.D., Erdemz, S., (2010) Journal of Information & Knowledge Management, 9, pp. 171-181; Zeng, L., Xu, L., Shi, Z., Maoguang, W., Wu, W., (2006) IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics; Ferreira, T., Pedrosa, I., Bernardino, J., (2017) Adv.

Many system changes are proposed from within the application structure, data structure and computing structure to adjust with fluctuation of mobile network connectivity, diversity between a plethora of modern devices, and the development of application programming paradigm. There have been many mobile and cloud offloading schemas that have been proposed on the last couple of years, each with their own objective in mind. When addressing proof of location in web application, the current approach of using server-client architecture has problems in scalability. Server can only handle limited computations concurrently, and when addressing the problem of scalability, a good approach is to use decentralized system. This paper is proposing a decentralized approach using reverse offloading architecture to address proof of location as an alternative to global positioning system in web application. The development method for our decentralized web-app is using WebAssembly, and our scalability performance is evaluated using docker swarm simulation test, and our proposed reverse offloading architecture shows better performance in network throughput and computing resources.

They become an asset for companies that contain important insights and support in decision-making processes. Big data is one of technologies that used by many organizations for managing store data and data analysis. Therefore, storage management is one of important processes in big data management to ensure that data are stored correctly, safely and easily to be accessed. Despite having many advantages, big data technology still has several issues on storage management, especially if we relate between big data and cloud computing, such as data security which is very important. In this paper, we reviewed the previous works for data security in storage management in big data technology and provide a suggestion to answer the challenge of data security. © 2018 IEEE.","big data; cloud computing management; security; storage","Cloud computing; Decision making; Digital storage; Energy storage; Information management; Storage management; Big data technologies; Decision making process; security; Semi-structured; Big data",,,,"Binus University","VI.

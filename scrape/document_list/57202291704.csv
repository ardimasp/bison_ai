At Bina Nusantara University there are organic and nonorganic trash bins, but the function is still not optimal due to the unfavorable interest of Binusian to use it or to carry out recycling activities. The survey was conducted using a questionnaire to 114 Binusian respondents qualitatively to get responses from 14 attributes related to recycling care and the design of the trash. The response from these 14 attributes will be the customer voice that is processed using Quality Function Deployment (QFD) to determine technical priorities that can be used to meet customer requirements. From the planning matrix, the factors that must be improved are the availability of organic and nonorganic waste bins, as well as improvements to the design of existing trash bins at Bina Nusantara University. Implementation of technical requirements in the form of rewards for recycling activities carried out especially for plastic waste, making redesigns for unique and innovative bins with 70% stainless steel and 30% fiberglass, and making a system that is integrated with accounts for rewarding is expected to be able meets 14 customer requirement attributes. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","innovative bins; Quality Function Deployment (QFD); questionnaire; waste recycling","Quality function deployment; Recycling; Sales; Surveys; Customer requirements; Plastic wastes; Public awareness; Quality function deployments (QFD); questionnaire; Technical requirement; Waste bins; Waste recycling; Bins",,,,"Binus University: 033/VR","This project is supported by Bina Nusantara University Internal Applied Grant with the number of 033/VR.RTT/IV/2019.","Costa, B.S., Bernardes, A.C., Pereira, J.V., Zampa, V.H., Pereira, V.A., Matos, G.F., Soares, E.A., Silva, A.F., Artificial Intelligence in Automated Sorting in Trash Recycling (2018) Anais Do XV Encontro Nacional de Inteligência Artificial e Computacional, pp. 198-205; Suwerda, B., (2012) Bank Sampah (Kajian Teori & Penerapan) Pustaka Rihama; Sharma, P., Dhanwantri, K., Mehta, S., Solid Waste Management (2014) International Journal of Environmental Research and Development, 4, pp. 49-54; Liu, S.F., Wang, M.H., Lee, Y.L., Cheng, Y.R., Applying Kano's Model and QFD in User Interface Research of Shoulder and Neck Pains Examining Software (2016) 2016 8th International Conference on Information Technology in Medicine and Education (ITME), pp. 94-98; Basri, W.S., House of Quality as a Quality Tool in Higher Education Management (2015) Journal of Culture, Society, and Development, 10, pp. 21-24; Reihan, F., Herisiwanto, Anita, S., Desain Litter Cathcer Menggunakan Metode Quality Function Deployment (QFD) dan Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) (2019) Jurnal Online Mahasiswa Fakultas Teknik, 6, pp. 2-5; Irene, Y., Ruswandi, B., Analisis peningkatan kualitas pelayanan dengan Quality Function Deployment (QFD) pada Laboratorium Matematika Pusat Laboratorium Terpadu (2013) Jurnal Matematika Integratif, 9 (2), pp. 147-160; Rezeki, R., Perancangan Perbaikan Kualitas Layanan E-commerce: Studi Pelanggan Jakarta (2018) Operations Excellence, 10 (3), pp. 275-284",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

As an emerging non thermal technology, cold plasma could be used to give a pretreatment to a thermal-sensitive material, such as pretreatment to seeds of bell pepper prior to be planted in soil to understand the effect of this dry process during the germination period. In this experiment, the used argon plasma was generated by flowing argon gas with the rate of 2 L/min through a positively charged of stainless pipe at a distance of 15 mm from aluminum plate electrode. With an applied voltage of 9.8 kV (peak-to-peak) electrical energy from a high voltage AC power supply, argon plasma irradiation was employed to the bell pepper seeds for a predetermined period of time as pretreatment to the seeds during pre-planting. It was found that the temperature of the plasma never exceeded 35°C during the plasma irradiation to assure that no thermal damage occurred to the seeds. It was also confirmed from this study that by giving non thermal plasma treatment for 30 minutes to the seeds may enhance the germination of the bell pepper plants up to 90% in stem length and almost 2.5 times in root length compared to the pepper without treatment. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","agriculture; green bell pepper; Non-thermal plasma; seed germination","Agriculture; Argon; Bells; Cultivation; Electric power systems; Irradiation; Plasma applications; Shotcreting; Argon plasma treatment; Bell peppers; Non-thermal plasma treatment; Non-thermal technology; Nonthermal plasma; Plasma irradiations; Seed germination; Thermal sensitive material; Seed",,,,,,"Lu, P., Cullen, P.J., Ostrikov, K., (2016) Cold Plasma in Food and Agriculture Fundamentals and Applications, pp. 83-116; Weizong, W., Danhua, M., Xin, T., Annemie, B., Gliding arc plasma for CO2 conversion: Better insights by a combined experimental and modelling approach (2017) Chemical Engineering Journal, 330, pp. 11-25; Zhang, S., Rousseau, A., Dufour, T., Promoting lentil germination and stem growth by plasma activated tap water, demineralized water and liquid fertilizer (2017) RSC Advances, 7 (50), pp. 31244-31251; Vlasta, S., Pavel, S., Jakub, K., Jan, P., Milan, S., Monika, S., Jana, J., Mirko, C., Atmospheric pressure plasma treatment of agricultural seeds of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) with effect on reduction of diseases and germination improvement (2017) Plasma Processes and Polymers, 15 (2); Je-Wook, K., Pradeep, P., Chulkyoon, M., Effect of corona discharge plasma jet on surface-borne microorganisms and sprouting of broccoli seeds (2016) Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 97 (1), pp. 128-134; Khanit, M., Non-thermal plasma for germination enhancement of radish seeds (2016) Procedia Computer Science, 86, pp. 132-135; Florian, J., Stephane, S., Christophe, B., Thierry, D., Plasma-activation of tap water using DBD for agronomy applications: Identification and quantification of long lifetime chemical species and production/consumption mechanisms (2018) Water Research, 133, pp. 47-59; Samarah, N.H., Wang, H., Welbaum, G.E., Pepper (Capsicum annuum) seed germination and vigour following nanochitin, chitosan or hydropriming treatments (2016) Seed Science and Technology, 44 (3), pp. 609-615; Waranyoo, K., Phirayot, K., Ponlawat, U., Improved germination and vigour of sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.)

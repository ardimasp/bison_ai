PlayerUnknown's Battleground (PUBG) is one of the best-selling examples of games downloaded in early 2018. This study seeks to see how user experience and adaptive learning are obtained from this game. The research method uses neuroresearch. The results of the study show that the user experience is determined by the interest in the game. While the interest in being a pro player is a determining factor for players experiencing adaptive learning. © 2019 IEEE.","adaptive learning; game; user experience","Adaptive learning; game; Game players; research methods; User experience; Artificial intelligence",,,,"Binus University","This work is partially supported by Research Interest Group In Educational Technology, Bina Nusantara University.

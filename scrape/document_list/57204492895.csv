The problem is the large numbers of vehicles can cause limitation of the parking lots especially in malls or other public places. Usually people driving around the whole parking lots to find the available ones. when the parking lots are all full, driver must search for other places to park their vehicle immediately. Designing the Smart Parking Finder has the purpose of making it easier for users to get available parking spaces and showing the location of the existing parking lot. On the other hand, it also facilitates the search for parking lots, but can reduce the search time for parking lots, and can also save fuel. For now, the application is still for some parking lots at the mall that have collaborated.

However, selecting the required disaster recovery model based on functionality or usability, and the financial budget in manufacturing industry is not easy. It requires a method that can be used for technology selection. Top management has options for making decisions based on subjective assessments to select the appropriate disaster recovery model. An information systems typically support decision making process by offering the best alternative solutions.

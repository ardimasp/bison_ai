This enhances studies to try to improve services to meet these demands. is one to shape a better experience. development needs to be done in a structured way so that they are integrated and efficiently implement the latest technology to build a digital economy. For this reason, it is necessary to apply good governance in planning for the development of technology-based services, so that the development of smart cities towards digital prosperity can be realised. The most important thing that needs to map out is prioritising services in smart cities development.In this study, we conducted a literature study and observations of ICT implementation in the development of services in Indonesia. Then we do a mapping between services that can shape into a digital economy by referring to digital welfare introduced by Atkinsons.Our results show that the initial program that supports faster productivity growth is an ICT service that makes up smart cities is a priority that must be considered by the central and local governments. © 2019 IEEE.","Digital Economic; Digital Prosperity; Governance; Productivity Growth; Smart City","Information use; Productivity; Development needs; Digital Prosperity; Good governances; Governance; Information and Communication Technologies; Latest technology; Literature studies; Productivity growth; Smart city",,,,,"Kulesa, T., A vision of smarter cities: How cities can lead the way into a prosperous and sustainable future 'a vision of smarter cities: How cities can lead the way into a prosperous and sustainable future (2009) Susanne, Thank You for Joining Me Today, pp. 1-6; Visvizi, A., Lytras, M.D., Damiani, E., Mathkour, H., Policy making for smart cities: Innovation and social inclusive economic growth for sustainability (2018) Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management, 9 (2), pp. 126-133; Lopes, N.V., Smart governance: A key factor for smart cities implementation (2017) 2017 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid and Smart Cities, ICSGSC 2017, pp. 277-282; (2016) Cobit-it Governance Framework-Information Assurance Control | Isaca, , http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/cobit/Pages/Overview.aspx, isaca isaca.org.

Reference for visual elements will be useful to give inspiration in visual communication design outcomes, such as product design, poster, brochure, logo, or even in multimedia and animation. Wayang, a well-known Indonesian cultural heritage, needs to be preserved since its existence is slowly fading from contemporary life. This research will provide many aspects of wayang, such as historical, cultural, philosophical, and also from contemporary perspective through design perspective. The main focus of the book is about the wayang’s ornaments from Surakarta area. This research used exploration and experiment in design for its method. Outcomes from this research will become the source of inspiration and reference to create design products, which contain ‘local value’ with ‘contemporary spirits.’ Moreover, the main objective of developing the prototype of Indonesian wayang book ornament is to preserve a cultural heritage in the form of literature, so that we are also able to preserve the knowledge for our next generation in the future. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Design; Ornament; Prototype; Reference; Wayang",,,,,,"Wijaya, H., Reflections on project: Interactive book–40 world faith objects (2015) The Significance of Religious Objects in Museums and Secular Lifestyles, p. 4. , University of Westminster, London; (2014) Inscribed in 2008 (3.COM) on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity (Originally Proclaimed in 2003), , UNESCO, October; Dwiandiyanta, B., Yudi, A.B.M., Wijaya, M., Maslim, and Suyoto (2012) International Journal of Advanced Science and Technology, 43, p. 95; Wayang Sebagai Warisan Budaya Dunia (2008) Penerbit SIC; (2004), Wayang Sebagai Ungkapan Filsafat Jawa, Adita Pressindoesti, Yogyakarta; (1999), 2 (5). , Sena Wangi, Jakarta","Widyokusumo, L.; Visual Communication Design, Indonesia",,,"American Scientific Publishers",,,,,19366612,,,,"English","Adv.

While in Indonesia we have known Primbon provide a benchmark series of comparative size, which by many Java community known as petungan. The long-term goal of this paper is to put petungan as one measure in addition to the Golden Section proportions to create a system that can be used in compiling the balance of graphic design. The specific target of this research is to optimize the layout with petungan proportion, thus providing an ideal alternative proportion for the graphic design world, especially in Indonesia, and socialize it to fellow designers, industry, and the general public. Authors use Prijotomo’s study, which form mathematically the petungan measurement ratio as 5n+p formula; in Javanese’ architectural studies. Base on this formula, the author team will apply petungan formulation in to javanese’ artifacts; such as wayang, candi and keris measurement ratio. The author team are also will apply to media stationery proportion; such as letterhead, envelopes, and business cards in graphic design studies. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Digital graphic design; Local genius; Measure proportion; Petungan",,,,,,"Elam, K., (2004) Müller-Brockmann’s Beethoven Poster—Geometrc Analysis, , Princeton Architecture Press, New York; Geometry, (1993) The World Book Encyclopedia, World Book, , Inc., Chicago, IL; Frick, H., (1997) Pola Struktural Dan Teknik Bangunan Di Indonesia, , Kanisius, Jakarta; (1985), W.

Humans need food whenever and wherever they live. Recently, the number of restaurants and catering services is growing rapidly. Because of that, individuals in the society can choose their favorite food more easily. Furthermore, the internet has changed the way humans conduct businesses. Today, there are many catering services which are managed through websites. However, the websites can only be used by the owners. Therefore, a marketplace for catering services needs to be created. This study discusses the business plan for making the catering marketplace. The results of this study indicate that the catering marketplace can be run and produce revenue based on the calculation of ROI and IRR. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","Catering; IRR; Marketplace; ROI; Website","Commerce; Websites; Business plans; Catering; Human needs; Marketplace; Web based; Behavioral research",,,,,"(2016) Data Pengguna Internet Di Indonesia 2016, , http://goukm.id/data-pengguna-internet-di-indonesia-2016/; Wertz, B., Kingyens, A.T., (2015) A Guide to Marketplaces, , http://versionone.vc; Al-Fedaghi, S., Developing web applications (2011) International Journal of Software Engineering and Its Applications, 5 (2), pp. 57-68; Viehland, D., Critical success factors for developing an e-business strategy (2000) Proceedings of the 5Th Americas Conference on Information Systems, pp. 1-7; Shin, N., (1999) Strategies for Competitive Advantage in Electronic Commerce, pp. 164-171; Garrett, S., Skevington, P., An introduction to electronic commerce (2013) BT Technology Journal, 2 (4), pp. 190-193; SWOT Analysis: Strategy Skills (2013) Free-Management-Ebooks, , http://www.free-management-ebooks.com/dldebk-pdf/fme-pestle-analysis.pdf; Kotler, P., Keller, K.L., (2012) Marketing Management, , Upper Saddle River, N.J: Prentice Hall; Alfiani, P.W., (2014) Molla & Licker Model Untuk Analisis Critical Success Factor Website E-Commerce, , Studi Kasus Bhineka.com",,"Gaol F.L.Hutagalung F.Chew F.P.",,"CRC Press/Balkema","6th International Congress on Interdisciplinary Behavior and Social Sciences, ICIBSoS 2017","22 July 2017 through 23 July 2017",,217029,,9781138553804,,,"English","Issues Trends Interdiscip.

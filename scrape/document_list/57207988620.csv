Although it has been widely used by various universities, there is always effort to increase the interest of the user using a system of online learning which can be measured through user experience. Several quantitative and qualitative studies have been conducted to measure online learning from the aspect of the user experience; however, such a study is still arranged separately. This research discusses user experience measurement using two methods, namely user experience questioner (UEQ) as a quantitative study and evaluation heuristics (HE) as a qualitative study. The data retrieving in the measurement of user experience is run by distributing questionnaires to 100 students of the online-learning program in University xyz. Subsequently, the data was analyzed by employing UEQ and HE. The research results showed that the input and suggestions form users online learning is relatively similar. Results on UEQ attractiveness resulted in highest value and the novelty aspect of the lowest. While the results HE all aspects which had a good evaluation of the results, however there is still deficiencies which in the measurement HE will further detailing of which parts should be more focused on. On the final results, there are suggestions that HE may be the fix for combining UEQ and HE cannot be done, because each has its own distinctive aspects in the measurement. But both can complement the results of research with their respective advantages. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Online learning; The questioner heuristics evaluation; User experience; UX",,,,,,"Bongard-Blanchy, K., Bouchard, C., Dimensions of User Experience – from the Product D esign Perspective” (2015) Journal d’interaction Personne-Systeme, 3, pp. 1-15; Nagalingam, V., Ibrahim, R., User Experience of Educational Games: A Review of the Elements (2015) Procedia-Procedia Comput.

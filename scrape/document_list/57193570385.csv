Apart from being a medium for learning and conveying various information about Indonesia, BIPA teaching can also introduce Indonesian culture to foreign speakers. From year to year, international speakers who learn Indonesian continue to grow. This was accompanied by an increase in the number of BIPA providers in Indonesia. To support the acceleration of this growth, digital service is needed to make it easier to find native speaker tutors and adjust material according to the needs of foreign speakers. This digital service is a website that can bring international speakers and Indonesian language tutors wherever they are. This website is named BIPALOKA, which is a digital platform that bridges language lovers around the world who want to learn Indonesian from the community of Professional Indonesian tutors. The method used in making the BIPALOKA website is a waterfall model, which in the process is made in stages starting from analysis, planning, implementation, checking, deploying, and ending with maintenance. © 2020 IEEE.","Bahasa indonesia; BIPA; BIPALOKA; Native speaker; Website","Distance education; Information management; Web Design; Websites; Digital platforms; Digital services; Indonesia; Indonesian languages; Learning programs; Waterfall model; Information services",,,,,"Widyartono, D., Pembelajaran bahasa Indonesia untuk penutur asing berbasis blended learning (2017) Konferensi Internasional Pengajaran BIPA: Pemartabatan Bahasa Indonesia Dalam Menghadapi Perubahan Konstelasi Politik Dan Ekonomi Dunia, , Batu, Malang, Jawa Timur; Dereh, N.-M., Bipa learning media: Management and problems (2019) ISLLAC: Journal of Intensive Studies on Language, Literature, Art, and Culture, 3 (1), pp. 44-48; (2020) DARMASISWA Indonesia SCHOLARSHIP, , https://darmasiswa.kemdikbud.go.id/aboutus-2/, [Accessed 22 January 2020]; (2020), https://kemlu.go.id/nairobi/id/news/5112/pendaftaran-beasiswa-knb-2020-dibuka, [Accessed 29 February 2020]; Roger, P., Pressman, S., (2009) Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach, , 7th International edition, New York: McGraw-Hill; Maylawati, D.S., Darmalaksana, W., Ramdhani, M.A., Systematic design of expert system using unified modelling language (2017) The 2nd Annual Applied Science and Engineering Conference (AASEC), , Bandung, Indonesia; Irvan, R., Taufiq, M., Slamet, C., Andrian, R., Aulawi, H., Ramdhani, M.A., Early warning system in mobile-based impacted areas (2018) International Journal of Engineering and Technology, 7 (3-4), pp. 118-121; Slamet, C., Rahman, A., Sutedi, A., Darmalaksana, W., Ramdhani, M.A., Maylawati, D.S., Social media-based identifier for natural disaster (2017) The 2nd Annual Applied Science and Engineering Conference (AASEC), , Bandung, Indonesia; Slamet, C., Rahman, A., Ramdhani, M.A., Darmalaksana, W., Clustering the verses of the holy qur'an using k-means algorithm (2016) Asian Journal of Information Technology, 15 (24), pp. 5159-5162; Maylawati, D.S., Ramdhani, M.A., Zulfikar, W.B., Taufik, I., Darmalaksana, W., Expert system for predicting the early pregnancy with disorders using artificial neural network (2017) 5th International Conference on Cyber and IT Service Management (CITSM), , Denpasar, Indonesia; Zulfikar, W.B., Prasetyo, J.P., Ramdhani, M.A., Implementation of mamdani fuzzy method in employee promotion system (2017) The 2nd Annual Applied Science and Engineering Conference (AASEC), , Bandung, Indonesia; Maylawati, D.S., Ramdhani, M.A., Rahman, A., Darmalaksana, W., Incremental technique with set of frequent word item sets for mining large Indonesian text data (2017) 5th International Conference on Cyber and IT Service Management (CITSM), , Denpasar, Indonesia; Ramdania, D., Irfan, M., Saprudin, R., Alam, C.N., Ramdhani, M.A., Yusli, D., Web-based design for lecturer performance reporting applications (2018) Mathematics, Science and Computer Science Education International Seminar (MSCEIS), , Bandung, Indonesia; Hariyanto, A., (2015) Membuat Web Profil Sekolah Dan PPDB Online, , 2nd ed., Yogyakarta: Lokomedia",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","5th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2020","13 August 2020 through 14 August 2020",,163671,,9781728170718,,,"English","Proc.

Active participation can include information in the form of a report. In addition to active participation to provide the report, the public can also monitor directly related to the security of a location. With advances in information and communication technology at this time, the public can monitor rapid and real time. Indonesia United (IDUN) utilizing virtual community to create a security monitoring system locations nationwide uses the concept of mutual cooperation or crowdsourcing. The society can be provided information about their crime-prone locations using Indonesia United (IDUN) criminal system based website. Users can share information with location-based systems. This system will be use to report any crime where and when it happened. The proposed system will be very useful for users when traveling to unfamiliar areas, where they have little knowledge about the foreign environment. © 2016 IEEE.","Crowdsourcing; Google Map; IDUN; LBS; Traveling Areas; Web Portal Crime","Crime; Crowdsourcing; Location; Technical presentations; Virtual reality; Websites; Design and implementations; Google maps; IDUN; Information and Communication Technologies; Location-based systems; Security monitoring; Traveling Areas; Virtual community; Portals",,,,,"Park, Y.H., Relationship analysis between crime types and social attributes in South Korea (2013) Database Research, 29 (2), pp. 81-94; Zichermann, G., Cunningham, C., (2011) Gamification by Design, , Sebastopol, CA OReilly; Zheng, Y., Bao, J., Mokbel, M.F., Location-based and Preference-Aware Recommendation Using Sparse Geo-Social Networking Data, , November 2012; Ahmad, W., (2013) A Google Map Based Social Network (GMBSN) for Exploring Information about A Spesific Theory, 6, pp. 343-348. , July; Scellato, A., Mascolo, C., Measuring User Activity on An Online Location-Based Social Network, "" 2011 WEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS), pp. 918-923. , Shanghai, 10-15 April 2011; Bao, J., Zheng, Y., Mokbel, M.F., Location-based and preference-Aware recommendation using Sparse Geo-Social Networking Data Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems SIGSPATIAL, Redondo Beach, 6-9 November2012, pp. 199-208; Iqbal Maulana, F., Ban, Y., Soo Kim, C., (2015) A Location Based Social Network Application for Exploring Information about Crime with Google Maps, , Korea Multimedia Society (KJVIMS), Andong, South Korea; Iqbal Maulana, F., Setijadi Prihatmanto, A., Soo Kim, C., Idun crime website for exploring information about crime (2015) Korea Society for Internet (KIPS), Seoul, South Korea",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","6th International Annual Engineering Seminar, InAES 2016","1 August 2016 through 3 August 2016",,126071,,9781509007417,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

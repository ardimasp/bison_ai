Business can collect real time customer data by using internet of things and then processing those data using big data management to resolve problems, or to create new products. Insurance is a business industry that uses historical customer data to decide certain business aspects, such as premium amount for customer. Insurance company can combine internet of things and big data to collect customer’s data in real time and then use it to give fair and accurate premium calculation for the customer. Customer data is collected using various sensors in their smart watch and saved by an application. The application send the data to insurance company’s system through the internet. The customer data are stored and processed in Hadoop as the big data management system. Customer data are going through an analytical process to create result about specific customer’s risk which later can be used to calculate premium. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

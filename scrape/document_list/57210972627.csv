This action needs a lot of effort and lack of flexibility. This study focuses on using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to carry out their online daily business with one another. Despite of using API-Method, the paper presents an integrated information or data that reduces redundancy process. This study is to proposed system architecture which create new solution based on SOA and ESB as the main middleware through internet. It called the SOA integration for e-marketplace. It will integrated all used E-Commerce domains to one platform to manage as Single Source The objective is for interconnecting between different domains and make it become interoperability and manageability. The impact of the interoperability, it could be possible to seller to manage product listing and order management from all domains, and gain customer's satisfaction growth and also fulfil the flexibility demand from SMEs and customers. © 2019 IEEE.","E-Commerce; Marketplace; Marketplace Platform; Service Oriented Architecture (SOA); Single Source E-Commerce System","Computer architecture; Customer satisfaction; Electronic commerce; Information services; Interoperability; Middleware; Business expansion; E-commerce systems; Integrated informations; Marketplace; Marketplace Platform; Redundancy process; Small and medium enterprise; System architectures; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,"Aulkemeier, F., Schramm, M., Iacob, M., Van Hillegersberg, J., (2016) A service-oriented e-commerce reference architecture; Triandini, E., Djunaidy, A., Siahaan, D., (2017) A Maturity Model for E-Commerce Adoption by Small and Medium Enterprise in Indonesia; Abdulazim Mohamed, U., Galal-Edeen Galal, H., El-Zoghbi, Adel, A., (2010) Building An Integrated B2B E-Commerce Hub Architecture Based on SOA and Semantic Ontology; Baraka, R., Alashqar, Y., (2013) Building A SOA-Based Model for Purchase Order Management in E-Commerce Systems; Chiang, C., (2014) Software Development Concerns in the Building of Service-Oriented Based Enterprise Systems; Schmidt, M., Hutchison, B., Lambros, P., Phippen, R., The enterprise service bus: Making service-oriented architecture real (2005) IBM Systems Journal, 44 (4), pp. 781-797; Baraka, R., Alashwar, Y., (2013) Building A SOA-Based Model for Purchase Order Management in E-Commerce Systems; Ezenwoke, A., Misra, S., Adigun, M., (2013) An Approach for E-Commerce On-Demand Service-oriented Product Line Development",,"Slamin S.Prihandoko A.C.Adnan F.Prasetyo B.Nerisafitra P.Riskiawan H.Y.Sulistiyani E.Destarianto P.","IEEE Signal Processing Society Indonesia Chapter","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2019 International Conference on Computer Science, Information Technology, and Electrical Engineering, ICOMITEE 2019","16 October 2019 through 17 October 2019",,155867,,9781728134369,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

In Indonesia, the utilization of e-commerce has flourished because it has many benefits and advantages to broaden the market and stay competitive. However, it is faced with many challenges such as fraud, commission fees, limited contact between buyer and seller and misuse of personal data. Blockchain implementation has the potential to solve this problem with increased security and transparency through the implementation of cryptocurrency in payment and smart contracts. This paper explores the usage of the blockchain, cryptocurrency and smart contract to e-commerce for a secure and efficient transaction in Indonesia. The result will be used to propose blockchain technology as e-commerce platform architecture and systems in Indonesia. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

A university's commitment to quality, has pushed to implement a quality management system to maintain the overall education program that has been built. With strategic planning and university business management processes, designing an Enterprise Architecture (EA) as an architectural basic for providing data for the analysis of university management conditions using big data technology and data analytics is the answer. So that information can support rapid decision-making process in business management. This study uses the Value Chain method to analyze business processes, and the Zachman Framework approach to detail the needs of enterprise architecture, with the highest goal of this research is to produce Enterprise Architecture design and management blueprints. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Education is important in creating superior national seeds. An important component in education problems that are often found in the evaluation system in the thesis process at the university often occurs data manipulation. The research aims to design the idea of applying Blockchain-Based Technology to the thesis discussion system at universities. Forum Group Discussion (FGD) is used to collect data related to business processes in the thesis assessment from beginning to end. The literature review is used as a means to support the theories or hypotheses proposed in this study. Therefore, this research proposes to give the idea of designing a system. Assessing the thesis uses Blockchain-Based Technology to eliminate cheating in practice and can also increase the potential in the world of education so that it can move forward in this era. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The competition between e-commerce is done to attract many customers so that they are interested to buy. Therefore, e-commerce is using many strategies e.g. value creation brand (ambassador, image, and origin). The purpose of this research is to look at the effect of brand value creation (ambassador, image, and origin) on the purchase intention of e-commerce customers in Indonesia. There are 3 hypotheses stated at the beginning of the research and to prove the hypothesis, 412 questionnaires were distributed for this research. The questionnaires are analyzed with multiple regression using Smart-PLS 3. The results of this research showed that brand image and origin affect the purchase intention of e-commerce customers in Indonesia while brand ambassador does not affect. © IJSTR 2020.","Brand ambassador; Brand image; Brand origin; E-commerce; Purchase intention; Value; Value creation brand",,,,,,"Ferdinand, (2002) Manajemen Pemasaran.

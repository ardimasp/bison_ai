Argumentative sentences are often used in daily communication and have important role in each decision or conclusion making process. The research objective is to do observation in deep learning utilization combined with attention mechanism for argument annotation and analysis. Argument annotation is argument component classification from certain discourse to several classes. Classes include major claim, claim, premise and non-argumentative. Argument analysis points to argumentation characteristics and validity which are arranged into one topic. One of the analysis is about how to assess whether an established argument is categorized as sufficient or not. Dataset used for argument annotation and analysis is 402 persuasive essays. This data is translated into Bahasa Indonesia (mother tongue of Indonesia) to give overview about how it works with specific language other than English. Several deep learning models such as CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) are utilized for argument annotation and analysis while HAN (Hierarchical Attention Network) is utilized only for argument analysis. Attention mechanism is combined with the model as weighted access setter for a better performance. From the whole experiments, combination of deep learning and attention mechanism for argument annotation and analysis arrives in a better result compared with previous research. © 2020, The Author(s).","Argument analysis; Argument annotation; Attention mechanism; Bahasa Indonesia; Deep learning",,,,,"Universitas Indonesia, UI: R3.1/HKP.05.00/2018

While face attractiveness classification seems to be related to personal preference, building a robust attractiveness classifier is not impossible. There are several studies that have developed a classification system of facial attractiveness using a convolutional neural network and provide satisfactory results. The use of Image-net pre-trained convolutional neural network has been largely used by face-related research, yet none of them are related to facial attractiveness. This study aims to compare the famous deep learning architecture, such as VGG, Inception, and ResNet models. This research also aims to analyze the effect of using the Viola-Jones algorithm, as a preprocessing method, to the classification result of the built model. Viola-Jones algorithm will detect faces in image data, and 2 types of cropping will be done to extract the face region from the image, namely loose-crop and tight-crop. This research produces the highest accuracy value of 82.52% by using ResNet50 model and loose-crop preprocessing method. © 2018 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Face Recognition; Facial Attractiveness","Classification (of information); Convolution; Crops; Data mining; Face recognition; Grading; Neural networks; Classification results; Classification system; Convolutional neural network; Facial attractiveness; Learning architectures; Personal preferences; Pre-processing method; Viola - Jones algorithms; Deep learning",,,,,,,"Talamas, S.N., Mavor, K.I., Perrett, D.I., Blinded by beauty: Attractiveness bias and accurate perceptions of academic performance (2016) PLoS One, 11 (2); Foo, Y.Z., Simmons, L.W., Rhodes, G., Predictors of facial attractiveness and health in humans (2017) Sci.

Current trends in argumentation mining research use handcrafted features and traditional machine learning (e.g., support vector machine). We worked on two tasks: identifying argument components and recognising insufficiently supported arguments. We utilise deep learning approach and implement attention mechanism on top of it to gain the best result. We do also implement Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) in this task. HAN is a neural network that gives attention to two levels, which are word-level and sentence-level. Deep learning with attention mechanism models can achieve better result compared with other deep learning methods. This paper also proves that on research task with hierarchically-structured data, HAN will perform remarkably well. We do present our result on using XGBoost instead of a regular non-ensemble classifier as well.

This task is intended to analyze the presence of a support relation between two sentences. To be able to identify relations between two sentences or arguments, one is obliged to understand the nuance brought by both sentences. Our models are modification of siamese network architectures, in which we replace the feature extractor into Long Short Term Memory and implement cosine distance as the energy function. Our models take a pair of sentences as their input and try to identify whether there is a support relation between those two sentences or not.The primary motivation of this research is to prove that a high degree of similarity between two sentences correlates to sentences supporting each other. This work will focus more on the modification of siamese network and the implementation of attention mechanism. Due to the difference in dataset setting, we cannot arbitrarily compare our results with the prior research results. Therefore, this work will not highlight the comparison between deep learning and traditional machine learning algorithm per se, but it will be more of an exploratory research. Our models are able to outperform the baseline score of accuracy with a margin of 17.33% (67.33%). By surpassing the baseline performance, we believe that our work can be a stepping stone for deep learning implementation in argumentation mining field. © 2017 The Authors.

Besides HAN + XGBoost, we performed experiments with several other deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), bidirectional LSTM, and bidirectional GRU. All results with the best hyper-parameters are presented. In this paper, we present the following three key findings: (1) Shallow models work significantly better than the deep models when using only a small dataset. (2) Attention mechanism can improve the deep model’s result. In average, it improves Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC-AUC) score of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with a margin of 18.94%. The hierarchical attention network gave a higher ROC-AUC score by 2.25% in comparison to the non-hierarchical one. (3) The use of XGBoost as the replacement for the last fully connected layer improved the F1 macro score by 5.26%. Overall our best setting achieves 1.88% improvement compared to the state-of-the-art result. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Deep learning; Hierarchical Attention Network; Insufficiently supported argument; Shallow learning; XGBoost","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Recurrent neural networks; Attention mechanisms; Empirical analysis; Gradient boosting; Insufficiently supported argument; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Shallow learning; XGBoost; Long short-term memory",,,,"039A/VR","Acknowledgments.

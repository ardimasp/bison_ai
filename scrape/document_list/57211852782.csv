It can minimize the effort in software development to adjust and adapt the changes in business processes. In this study, we used SOA and Micro Services Concept to integrate applications for front end and back end mechanism. X is a company engaged in online healthcare and Y is a subsidiary of company X which also acts as a vendor and contributes to the supply of products. In this study, we propose the integration of these two separate applications using the service-oriented architecture concept. SOA concept can support the integration in various platform application in information systems between many organizations. We also used micro services concept to identify and analyze the list of micro services needed. In the result, we proposed reusable services, Restful web services architecture, API endpoint in micro services, and list of micro services. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

This technology has also been considered an important resource for companies because it has many benefits in its use. The majority of company information systems use more than 1 application for their business needs. These applications will be more useful if integrated with each other. In this paper, we focus on designing the implementation of integration between 2 applications in 2 different companies using the concept of Service Oriented Architecture. With the implementation of using this concept, it is hoped that each application will become free of dependency and exchange data more efficiently. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

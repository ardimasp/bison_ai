API Gateway can help to solve complexity problems with n-to-n integration, where n is the number of integrated applications. Implement Service Oriented Modeling and Architecture (SOMA) methodology as a guide in implementing SOA-based solutions. SOMA has seven parts, namely Business Modeling and Transformation, Solution Management, Identification, Specification, Realization, Implementation and Deployment, Monitoring and Management. API Latency Test Tools as a tool to measure the performance of each service connected to the B2C Ditoko.com web application. Data is analyzed by comparing service usage with the concept of API Gateway and n-to-n service integration where n is the number of integrated applications. The results obtained indicate that using the API-based SOA architecture has a lower time to access each services/pages than using a service with n-to-n integration (monolithic architecture). So that it can improve service quality performance. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The prediction of stock market always considered as challenging task in financial time series prediction given how dynamic stock markets are. Stock markets are heavily sentiment driven and along with rapid evolution in NLP, helping researcher in understand market sentiment better so it can give better result in stock prediction. Word2vec introduced in 2013 is touted as one of the biggest breakthrough in NLP field. However, in 2018 BERT was introduced and achieved state of the art result. The aim of this paper is to compare those method and apply those method in predicting future stock price. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

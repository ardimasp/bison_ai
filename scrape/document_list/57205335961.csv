The education sector must be able to create industry-ready graduates who require graduates with good analytical thinking, capable of solving complex problem, creative and adaptable. BeeCEO is one of the business process simulation software developed to meet these needs. Users can practice the business process theory in this business process simulation. However, to ensure that BeeCEO has been used properly by users, it is important to know in advance if BeeCEO has fulfilled all the dimensions of the user experience (UX). User Experience Questionnaire is a technique that can be used to assess whether BeeCEO has met users' expectations from the user experience dimensions. The results of this study show which BeeCEO UX dimensions need to be improved before they can be fully utilized by users. © 2019 IEEE.","business process simulation; evaluation; UEQ; UX","Information management; Surveys; Analytical thinking; Business Process; Business process simulation; Complex problems; Education sectors; evaluation; Industrial revolutions; User experiences (ux); Computer software",,,,"Binus University","This research funded by the internal grant of Bina Nusantara University. *) Corresponding author.","Industry 4. 0 and Its Impact on Education, , https://restart-project.eu/industry-4-0-impact-education/, [Accessed: 01-Jun-2019]; Bai, H., Pan, W., Hirumi, A., Kebritchi, M., Assessing the effectiveness of a 3-D instructional game on improving mathematics achievement and motivation of middle school students (2012) Br.

Based on data from the World Bank's Global Financial Inclusion data, only 0.4 % of the population over the age of 15 used mobile payment in 2015. This study's purpose is to define all the elements that affect the adoption of using mobile payment in Indonesia. Using data from 274 respondents which obtained via online to test the hypothesis based on the designed research model. Method of partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) used for processed the collected data. This study found that habit is the most powerful element affecting the rate of mobile payment adoption in Indonesia, followed by facilitating condition, social risk, performance expectancy, and social impact. It also found behavioral intention had a huge effect on usage behavior. Mobile payment service provider could use this outcome to make strategic decisions when implementing mobile payment in Indonesia. © 2018 IEEE.","behavior intention; mobile payment; partial least square; structural equation modelling","Global system for mobile communications; Information management; Least squares approximations; Population statistics; behavior intention; Behavioral intention; Facilitating conditions; Financial inclusions; Mobile payment; Partial least square (PLS); Strategic decisions; Structural equation modelling; Electronic money",,,,,,"MDI Ventures and Mandiri Sekuritas, ""Mobile Payments in Indonesia : Race to Big Data Domination, "" 2018; Luarn, P., Lin, H.H., Toward an understanding of the behavioral intention to use mobile banking (2005) Comput.

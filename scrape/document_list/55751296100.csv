It demonstrates that the employment conditions of Indonesian domestic workers in Hong Kong encourage certain types of behaviour, which in turn contribute to the processes of stereotype formation and maintenance about them in the host society. Intergroup contact theory predicts that even superficial interaction should disconfirm existing stereotypes, but this article shows how the ‘context of reception’ in host societies prevents this from happening through its creation of sub-optimal conditions, such as unequal power relationships. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Hong Kong; Intergroup contact; Labour disputes; Migrant workers; Stereotype","Asian immigrant; ethnic minority; international migration; migrant worker; national identity; stereotypic behavior; China; Hong Kong",,,,,,"Amelina, A., Faist, T., De-naturalizing the national in research methodologies: Key concepts of transnational studies in migration (2012) Ethnic and Racial Studies, 35 (10), pp. 1707-1724; (2007) Underpayment 2: The continuing systematic extortion of Indonesian migrant workers in Hong Kong: An indepth study, , AMC, IMWU and KOTKIHO, Hong Kong; Augoustinos, M., Walker, I., Donaghue, N., (2014) Social cognition: An integrated introduction, , 3, SAGE, Los Angeles; (2016) Badan Nasional Penempatan Dan Perlindungan Tenaga Kerja Indonesia (BNP2TKI). 2017.

When seeking to prevent asylum seekers from coming to Australia to enjoy the right to asylum there, the Australian government has tested a number of deterrent mechanisms that sometimes border on illegality and even state crime. In May 2015, for example, Australian authorities intercepted an Indonesian boat carrying 65 asylum seekers and allegedly paid the six smugglers to return their passengers to Indonesia. In this article, we reconstruct what happened at sea, and put forward a number of arguments that categorise this ‘turnback’ as explicitly-commissioned people smuggling against Indonesia. Our article also points to further implications about looming risks if the policy was to be employed more widely by states in other areas of the world where people cross the sea to seek asylum. Not only would the practice severely undermine international collaborations that have developed to prevent and combat people smuggling, but it would also create additional safety risks for those who are turned back. © 2020, © 2020 Australian Institute of International Affairs.","Asylum seekers; border protection; Indo-Pacific region; people smuggling; state crime","asylum seeker; border region; crime; international law; smuggling; territorial dispute; Australia; Indonesia",,,,,,"(2016), Operation Sovereign Borders: Log of Boat Arrivals and Other Asylum Seeker Incidents.

It presents a case study of the landmark case in which a migrant labour recruitment agency was successfully prosecuted for human trafficking. This article explains the rationale and motivation of the prosecution in four sections. First, it considers the development and purpose of corporate liability as a legal concept to foreground the second section, which outlines the legal and policy framework for pursuing corporations that commit crime in Indonesia. This section also offers a detailed discussion about how individuals have been proceeded against in human trafficking cases that involve corporations. Third, this article presents a case study of the first and only instance where a corporation was successfully prosecuted for human trafficking to highlight the sequence of events that made the effort possible. Fourth, the discussion that follows identifies the prosecution's motivations for bringing the case, and makes empirical conclusions about the purpose of prosecuting corporations for human trafficking through the Indonesian legal system. In conclusion, this article argues that the institutional drive to punish corporate involvement in economic crime has created the necessary systems to seek the punishment of a wider range of other corporate crimes, including human trafficking.

However, some countries continue to see themselves primarily as senders and so ignore their role as a receiving country, which can have negative implications for the rights of migrants in their territory. Using the example of Indonesia, which is State Party to the 1990 UN Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Their Families, this article demonstrates that irregular migrant workers in this country have the legal right to protection against labour exploitation even when they work despite the government’s prohibition on employment. The article discusses the ‘right to work’ and how international human rights law has translated it into the ‘right to protection from labour exploitation’ for irregular migrants in Indonesia. By way of two case studies about the Indonesian government’s handling of irregular migrants, it shows how it prioritises enforcement of the employment immigration law over labour and employment laws much like countries that have not ratified the ICRMW. It also draws attention to legal protection gaps that emerge for asylum seekers when they are recognised to be genuine refugees. © 2019, © 2019 Global South Ltd.","Asylum seeker; human trafficking; Indonesia;

In fact, the more complex smuggling operations rely on broad networks of foreign organizers as well as local intermediaries and ground staff. In 2011, the Indonesian legislature introduced a severe minimum sentence for any involvement in migrant smuggling with the expectation that the judiciary would apply the sentence in all future cases. However, some judges proceeded to hand down sentences below the statutory minimum, arguing that the punishment is not commensurate to the relatively minor roles played by locals. This article examines how judges at all levels of the judiciary did so in ten related cases. In conclusion, it argues that statutory sentences are not mandatory in Indonesia and that, by applying below-minimum sentences, judges not only maintain judicial independence; they also effectively exercise a judicial review function. © Cambridge University Press and KoGuan Law School, Shanghai Jiao Tong University 2018.","criminal justice system;

The IOM helped the migrants and offered to cover the cost of repatriation to their countries of citizenship. The Indonesian government appreciated the financial support, not least because the victims’ embassies refused to pay. But most victims in one location refused to return to their home country without the wages owed to them by their trafficker-cum-employers. IOM policy states that migrants are eligible to use the Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration (AVRR) service if they are unable or unwilling to remain in the host country. But another condition is that migrants must use the services voluntarily. The IOM could not force the migrants to leave the country, and national law prevented the Indonesian government from deporting the migrants because the IOM had identified them as victims of trafficking. © 2017 The Author.

The reasons for exploring this case in detail are twofold. First, the use of Indonesian child labor in migrant smuggling operations is a prevalent practice. Evidence of this is particularly obvious in the large number of Indonesian children imprisoned or otherwise detained in Australia for their involvement in migrant smuggling. Second, we consider how these people fit into the smuggling-trafficking nexus before discussing the concepts of ""victim"" and ""perpetrator"" in a case where justice officials do not agree whether a juvenile transporter should be treated as an active perpetrator, and therefore punishable for migrant smuggling, or whether to treat him as a passive victim of trafficking who was deceived into carrying out the crime. © Scalabrini Migration Center 2017.","Australia; Exploitation; Human trafficking; Indonesia; People smuggling; Underage offenders","asylum seeker; child labor; conceptual framework; crime; exploitation; international migration; smuggling; trafficking; Australia; Indonesia",,,,"DP150101911","This research received funding support from the Australian Research Council Discovery Project (DP150101911).","Andrews, D., Bonta, J., Rehabilitating criminal justice policy and practice (2010) Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 16 (1), pp. 39-55; Arocha, L., (2010) Wrong Kind of Victim?

However, they may make exceptions, allowing other states to perform limited regulatory functions within their territory. For example, Hong Kong, which is a special administrative region in China with autonomy to administer international migration, has a policy that requires foreign states to endorse their citizens' application for legal employment as domestic workers there. This policy enables consular offices to develop public-private partnerships with local migrant labour employment companies and through those arrangements extend their regulatory function into an extraterritorial setting. Using an Indonesian case study, this article shows how one consulate has harnessed the policy for the purpose of compelling Hong Kong recruiters to apply for a licence to provide job-matching services for its citizens. The power that Indonesia gains through the system has enabled a variety of extraterritorial interventions, which have had mixed results and particularly negative consequences for Indonesian migrant labour. Nevertheless, the arrangements reveal more about the subfield of world politics in which states demonstrate a clear preference for engaging with private individuals over other states concerning transnational governance matters in their own territory. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Hong Kong; Indonesia; International migration; Public-private partnership; World politics","autonomy; employment; international migration; labor migration; legal rights; legislation; migrant worker; policy approach; public-private partnership; regulatory framework; sovereignty; China; Hong Kong; Indonesia",,,,,,"(2008) Pengantar rekrut SIP agensi Al Ahliya (EST) Labour Suplay, , Addressed to Direktor-Jenderal Binapenta, Depnakertrans. 004/R-SIP/AJASPAC/XI/2008.

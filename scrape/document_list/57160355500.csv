By providing a means that has a comprehensive health management starting from the body, mind and spirit, which contributes to the recovery of health and illness, becomes one solution that can be done to improve the level of health and also as a means of promoting health, preventing disease and helping to improve aware of the disease in our lives. The link between health and the surrounding environment can be proven in a dimension that integrates visual, auditory, olfactory, kinaesthetic, vestibular and proprioception sensations win the form of room quality that can support the health process indirectly. This paper aims to discuss the importance of the importance of applying a quality space based on the healing space principle by examining the literature review.

Most patients not only have pain in their body, but also anxiety and depression, and physical fatigue. Therefore, the process of handling cancer must be comprehensive, both from physical and mental and psychological care with the Optimal Healing Environment (OHE) approach. The OHE concept needs to be applied not only in cancer-specific hospitals, but also needs to be applied in comprehensive cancer care facilities to relieve patient pain, fatigue and weakness.

The problem that often occurs is the architectural and built environment design dominates by the visual sensory, whereas it should, the perception of space is received through full spectrum of perceptual quality. This multisensory approach conducted with sensewalking - open questioner and semantic differential scales - to assess the perception of the classroom.

Thoserequirements of development can be done by the government, the private sector or by the individual sectors, but it needs to follow the ordinance which is set in the city plan to avoid the adverse negative impact in the future. The problems are if the monitored development in the city is like Jakarta - Indonesia, which have an area of 661 square kilometres compared with the limitation of government employee source. Therefore, it is important to advancing the new tools to monitor the development of the city, due to the large development area and the limitation of source. This research explores the using of Low-altitude UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) combined with photogrammetry techniques - a new rapidly developing technology - to collect as-built building development information in real time, cost-effective and efficient manner.

According to the New Cities Summit in 2015, it is predicted in 2050 that 70% of the population will be in urban areas. So, urban development should anticipate that problems, the high density of a city. The development of the city is not only designed as residential facilities for people to live in, but also to provide a wide range of facilities to support their better life. On the other hand, Indonesian government has already had a standard for planning and designing settlements areas. It is explained in the Indonesian National Standard Regulation No. 03-1733-2014 But the standards are often difficult to apply in the development of a particular region. The main difficulty is in calculating the required facilities areas and in placing that facilities along with the required density residential facilities. Therefore, the aim of this study is to seek a balance between the development of residential areas and other required facilities by using computational logic for the settlement planning and design. The use of computer logic will help in generative design, which the computer will calculate and recalculate based on changes in the input. The output of this research is the calculation formula of the facilities and residential unit that should be provided as well as 3-dimensional formation of residential areas along with the planned density. © 2016 IEEE.","Density; Housing Planning and Design; Parametric Design","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Density (specific gravity); Housing; Logic programming; Population statistics; Urban growth; Urban planning; Calculation formula; Computational logic; Generative design; Parametric design; Planning and design; Planning and designings; Population growth; Residential areas; Smart city",,,,,,"(2015) 21 Smart Cities, , UN Habitat United Nation.

One of the factors that affect the formation of a city is the increasing population of the region. When the horizontal development has not been done for some reason, an alternative that is often used is vertical development, which will increase the density in the region. However, to be considered, that the increase of density in a region should also lead to the increase of life supporting infrastructure, such as transport infrastructure and so on. More importantly, everyone needs to meet their daily needs, including Indonesia. The development of transport infrastructure in Indonesia is still focused on the development of the road network. Therefore, there is a need to increase the density with careful consideration of the existing road network to avoid negative impacts such as the traffic jam. This simulation aims to seek the shape of a neighbourhood through optimizing the density with consideration of the roads’ level of service. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","Level of service; Optimum density; Shape the urban neighbourhood","Building materials; Traffic congestion; Level of Service; Neighbourhood; Optimum density; Service levels; Traffic jams; Transport infrastructure; Urban density; Urban design; Roads and streets",,,,,,"(1999), Regional Spatial Plan of Jakarta, Capital Regional Regulation No. 6; Jakarta Governor Decree No. 678 of 1994, on Improving Building intensity in the Jakarta region; Monchaux, N., Patwa, S., Golder, B., Jensen, S., Lung, D., Local Code: The Critical Use of Geographic Information Systems in Parametric Urban Design (2010) Proceedings of ACADIA Life In, , Formation, NY, NY; Karya, B., (1997) Indonesian Highway Capacity Manual, , Bina Karya Press; Stover, K., (1983) Traffic Access and Impact Studies for Site Development: A Recommended Practice, , Institute of Transportation Engineers, Transportation Planners Council; Tamin, O.Z., (2000) Perencanaan Dan Pemodelan Transportasi, , ITB Publishing, Bandung",,"Chang S.-Y.Bahar S.K.A.Husain A.A.M.Zhao J.",,"CRC Press/Balkema","4th International Conference on Civil Engineering and Building Materials, CEBM 2014","15 November 2014 through 16 November 2014",,158019,,9781138000889,,,"English","Adv.

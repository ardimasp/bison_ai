The objective of this study was to develop a model for automatic classification of musical genres from audio data by using features from low-level time and frequency domains. These features can highlight the differences between different genres. In the model, feature selection is performed using a genetic algorithm (GA), and the resulting dataset is classified using the k-nearest neighbor (KNN), naive Bayes classifier (NBC), and support vector machine (SVM) learning methods. Tenfold cross-validation is used to obtain the optimal f-measure value. In this study, the data were obtained from the GTZAN genre collection datasets. In the performance evaluation, it was found that the GA-based feature selection strategy can improve the F-measure rate from 5% to 20% for the KNN, NBC, and SVM-based algorithms. In addition, the proposed SVM-GA algorithm can exactly better than other comparison algorithms. © 2019 ASTES Publishers.

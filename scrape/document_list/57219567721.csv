The grand purpose of our research is to combine technology and psychology together to develop more efficient therapeutic techniques. The research methods used in this paper are experiment and questionnaire. The anxiety level of the participants is decreasing in each exposure; thus, the VR-based exposure can be considered effective to be used as acrophobic alternative therapy. © 2020 IEEE.","Acrophobia; Exposure; Therapy; Virtual reality","Information management; Alternative therapy; Anxiety levels; Therapeutic techniques; Virtual reality",,,,,"(2017) Specific Phobia [Internet], , https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/specific-phobia.shtml, National Institute of Mental Health [cited 2020 Jul 3]; Wardenaar, K.J., Lim, C.C.W., Al-Hamzawi, A.O., Alonso, J., Andrade, L.H., Benjet, C., The cross-national epidemiology of specific phobia in the world mental health surveys (2017) Psychol Med, 47 (10), pp. 1744-1760; Eaton, W.W., Bienvenu, O.J., Miloyan, B., Specific phobias (2018) The Lancet Psychiatry, 5 (8), pp. 678-686; North, M.M., North, S.M., Coble, J.R., Virtual reality therapy: An effective treatment for psychological disorders (1997) Stud Health Technol Inform., 44, pp. 59-70; Rebelo, F., Noriega, P., Duarte, E., Soares, M., Using virtual reality to assess user experience (2012) Hum Factors, 54 (6), pp. 964-982; Julian, L.J., Measures of anxiety: State-trait anxiety inventory (STAI), beck anxiety inventory (BAI), and hospital anxiety and depression scale-anxiety (HADS-A) (2011) Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken)., 63 (11), pp. S467-S472; Halarnkar, P., Shah, S., Shah, H., Shah, H., Shah, A., A review on virtual reality (2012) Int J Comput Sci Issues, 9 (6), p. 325; Maurya, R.K., (2014) Computer Graphics with Virtual Reality Systems, , 2nd ed.

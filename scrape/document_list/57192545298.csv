Keyboard Dynamics is one of the solution to perform password authentication without adding any tools which being disruptive to some users. The biometric keystroke dynamic system is relatively unexplored compared to other behavioral authentications discipline. Coupled with the limited number of studies that have been done compared with other biometric systems. Several machine learning research has been conducted but few of them applying deep learning for solving this problem. This research will be focusing in deep learning using optimizer to beat the previous research which using another machine learning techniques. This research shows a better result using optimizer in deep learning resulting in 92.60% accuracy. © 2018 The Authors.

However, the young generation does not fully explore this potential and prioritize computerization and technology instead, as they consider those things a bigger asset for the country. This research aims to help preserve Indonesia's local traditions and culture, and reintroducing them to the young generation in the hope of attracting their interest. Losari Topeng dance as one of Indonesia's local cultural heritages will be the main topic explored in this research. It will be done by using visual documentation approach, in the form of photography that has a power on social media and on the internet, both the biggest and the fastest source in spreading information that is distance-free and can reach to a wide audience. Author concludes that photography will be the effective approach to document and visualize this mask dance heritage of the Indonesian culture as a way to preserve it. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Physics; Cultural heritages; Effective approaches; Ethnic groups; Indonesia; Social media; Photography",,,,,"Boas, N.T., Wolfe, L.D., (1997) Biological Antrophology, , (International Institute for Human Evolutionary Research); Bonafix, D.H., Hartono, H., Perayaan sejit Kongco Ceng Gwan Cin di kelenteng Tek Hay Kiong dalam kacamata fotografi (2014) Humaniora, 5 (2), pp. 1098-1113; Ramsay, G., Sweet, H., (2009) A Creative Guide to Exploring Your Life: Self-Reflection Using Photography, Art, and Writing, , (London: Jessica Kingsley Publishers); Freeman, M., (2013) Black and White Photography Field Guide : The Essential Guide to the Art of Creating Black and White Images, , (Waltham, Massachusetts: Focal Press); Felix, J., Penggunaan elemen visual garis dalam fotografi (2011) Humaniora, 2 (1), pp. 48-57; Buckland, G., (1980) Fox Talbot and the Invention of Photography, , (Boston, Massachusetts: David R Godine Pub); Hirsch, R., (2000) Seizing the Light : A History of Photography, , (New York, NY: McGraw-Hill); Langford, M., (2000) Basic Photography, , (Oxford: Focal Press); Anon, E., Anon, J., (2013) See It: Photographic Composition Using Visual Intensity, , (Focal Press); (2014) Pangeran Losari 'Angkawijaya' Tali Sejarah Cirebon Brebes, , http://www.radarcirebon.com/pangeran-losari-angkawijaya-tali-sejarah-cirebon-brebes.html, Radar Cirebon; Lasmiyati, Sejarah Pertumbuhan dan Perkembangan tari topeng Cirebon abad XV - XX (2011) Patanjala, 3 (3), pp. 472-487; Nurhazizah, U., (2015) M2Indonesia: Noor Anani Maska Irman, , https://m2indonesia.com/tokoh/sastrawan/noor-anani-maska-irman.htm; Kusnandar, D., (2010) Topeng Losari di Tangan Pewarisnya, , http://nasional.kompas.com/read/2010/08/28/14070541/about.html; Dewi, E.N., (2012) Tari Topeng Losari, Gerakan Geometrik Dan Luwes, Pikiran Rakyat, Seni Budaya, , http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/211668",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Advance and Scientific Innovation, ICASI 2018","23 April 2018 through 24 April 2018",,148653,17426588,,,,"English","J.

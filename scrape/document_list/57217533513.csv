The existence of this medical record can provide health profile information and medical history of the patients being treated. With this basis, doctors and medical staff can provide diagnoses, suggestions for actions to be taken as well as accuracy in determining the drug for patient consumption. However, medical records in the system at the hospital have not been packaged properly invalid data conditions, because the data collection and input processes were carried out by different officers. Not only the ability of officers to interact with information system modules but also discipline, accuracy, mastery of officers in the medical field as well as the ability to read manual documents to be re-entered into the information system. This research was carried out based on direct monitoring of the system used in several hospitals and found the existence of data invalidity in the information system that has the potential to become a risk that ultimately becomes a loss both for patients and for medical staff and hospital management. Allowing invalid data will be a threat that comes from within the hospital environment itself. © 2020 IEEE.","Data validation; Electronic medical record; Health information system; Information system security; Risk management","Diagnosis; Hospitals; Human resource management; Information management; Information use; Medical computing; Patient treatment; Data collection; Direct monitoring; Hospital environment; Hospital information systems; Hospital management; Medical fields; Medical history; Medical record; Medical information systems",,,,,"(2005) Information Technology Security Techniques Code of Practice for Information Security Management International, , I. 27002; Appari, A., Johnson, M.E., Information security and privacy in healthcare: Current state of research (2010) Int.

The calculation of drug needs must be done optimally. Because of the excess drug will be a management problem in the drug and pharmaceutical warehouses and expire, while if the lack of medicine will harm patient health and reduce patient satisfaction and trust that also affects the hospital business. This study developed the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network in studying the problem of time series prediction on the use of drugs in prescribing patients in hospitals. The calculation of the prediction of drug needs for the coming period is based on the availability of data on drug expenditure in the previous period. Prediction models are trained and tested with monitoring data from January 2017 to December 2019. The results of research on the predicted value of the model and the actual value show the feasibility and effectiveness of using the LSTM network to predict the optimum drug needs in the coming weeks. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

During the pandemic, there were a lot of cases that were reported to increase exponentially. In this situation, the dissemination of messages and information was very important. The social media platform has contributed as a channel of communication with unprecedented speed. However, the uncontrolled and irresponsible dissemination of information will result in new problems that can be detrimental to many parties. A lot of information may trigger panic, fear and result in lose hope and even paranoia. The provision of correct and timely information as well as any curative and preventive effort to stop the disease are very important. This study aims to present a method in finding out public opinion through Twitter social media mining in the Indonesian context. We are particularly interested in finding out what people’s stance with the pandemic. Some people may fully aware of this threat, but the remaining could be careless about what is going on. It is assumed that this stance could lead to people’s obedience to the government’s policy on COVID 19 Protocol. It is believed that the opinion is hidden behind the comments in the media. By scrapping the tweets on Twitter during March 2020 using Corona and COVID Keywords, we obtained as many as 31,003 tweets. We manually classified the tweets into 3 classes, positive, negative and neutral stances. Predictive models are derived using Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes algorithms. Random Forest-based model gives the highest accuracy level as high as 89%, followed by Support Vector Machine as high as 87% and Naïve Bayes as high as 68%. The model can further be used to classify opinions in the future giving valuable information for the government in making policies and steps in overcoming the pandemic. © 2020, Faisal Binsar and Tuga Mauritsius.","Coronavirus Pandemic; Data Science; Infodemic Social Media; Machine Learning; Sentiment Analysis; Twitter Clustering",,,,,,"Aggarwal, C.

Therefore, they will be ready to contend and to be an ambitious individual in the real world. All graduates are judged by their Grade Point Average (GPA). Therefore, in Indonesia, it is critical to maintaining a good GPA from the first semester until the graduation. Although the student is the main actor, it is not only their job to maintain the GPA. The good-grade university also needs to participate by helping them to get the best help and environment during the lecture. The university should able to create conducive learning environment to support and to help undergraduate students in maintaining a good GPA. The purposes of this paper are to identify and analyze the factors that affect a good performance of student's GPA, to give suggestions to education institution as a preventive action of low performance of student's GPA, and to design a successful model to achieve good GPA. Methodologies used in this paper are literature study, analysis at the University, model trial, and giving the result and solutions. © 2016 IEEE.","GPA; Grade Point Average; graduate; undergraduate students;

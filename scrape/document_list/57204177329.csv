This study using UTAUT 2 model approach. The primary data obtained from interviews, direct observation and questionnaires that distributed and processed using SEM-PLS. The results of this study provide qualitative calculation results of UTAUT 2 variable. The conclusion obtained that interest of the use of application VEBS affected by variables facilitating condition, performance expectancy and behavioral intention. From these conclusions this study provided an idea to the future development of application's features for more effective and efficient use. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Electronic commerce; Online systems; Behavioral intention; Calculation results; Central Asia; Direct observations; Electronic banking; Facilitating conditions; Model approach; Primary data; Surveys",,,,,"Turban, E., Volonino, L., Wood, G.R., (2012) Information Technology for Management: Advancing Sustainable, Profitable Business Growth, , 9 (Wiley Global Education); Gambetta, N., Zorio-Grima, A., García-Benau, M.A., Complaints Management and Bank Risk Profile (2015) Journal of Business Research, 68 (7), pp. 1599-1601; Siu, N.Y.-M., Zhang, T.J.-F., Yau, C.-Y.J., The Roles of Justice and Customer Satisfaction in Customer Retention A Lesson from Service Recovery (2013) Journal of Business Ethics, 114 (4), pp. 675-686; Venkatesh, V., Thong, J.Y., Xu, X., Consumer Acceptance and Use of Information Technology: Extending the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (2012) MIS Quarterly, 36, pp. 157-178; Garding, S., Bruns, A., (2015) Complaint Management and Channel Choice, , (Springer); Faed, A., (2013) An Intelligent Customer Complaint Management System with Application to the Transport and Logistics Industry, , (Switzerland: Springer); Federal Trade, C., (2012) Electronic Banking, , (Commission Federal Trade); Djaali, H., Muljono, P., (2008) Pengukuran Dalam Bidang Pendidikan, , (Jakarta: Grasindo); Schumacher, S., McMillan, J.H., (2010) Research in Education: Evidence-Based Inquiry, , 7 (New Jersey: Pearson Education Inc); Sarstedt, M., Hopkins, L., Kuppelwieser, V.G., Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) : An emerging tool in business research (2014) European Business Review, 26, pp. 121-196. , Hair J.

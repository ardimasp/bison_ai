The innovations make life activies easier and efficient. One of technology innovation widely known in Indonesia is GO-JEK. This study is intended for the users of GO-JEK application. GO-JEK was initially an Indonesian-based company engaged in the transportation services using an online-based mobile application. Since it was founded in 2011, GO-JEK has grown rapidly and reached many consumers. This research aims to see how factors such as discounts, promos, transaction speeds, convenience, etc. affect the users in using GO-PAY as a means of payment. The data show that the transaction volume using FinTech payment has risen significantly. Authors want to conduct the study on what factors make people interested in choosing GO-PAY and remain loyal to use it. The research can be used in FinTech development in the future or used in other research as based what factors that have priority above the others. The study was completed by conducting a survey for 3-days, involving 71 GO-JEK application users living in the Greater Jakarta area. The data collected was then processed using multiple linear regression analysis. Data processing results show that cost savings, speed, convenience, and security guarantee offered in GO-PAY, altogether have significant effects on its use as a means of payment or transaction. The study show that the most significant factor influencing the user to use GO-PAY as means of payment is the variable of Security Guarantee. © 2019 IEEE.","costs; Fin Tech; GO-PAY; multiple linear regression; security; transaction speed","Costs; Fintech; Information systems; Information use; Linear regression; GO-PAY; Ict development; Mobile applications; Multiple linear regression analysis; Multiple linear regressions; security; Technology innovation; Transportation services; Data handling",,,,,"(2019) About Gojek History and Services, , https://www.gojek.com, Accessed on: Aug. 15, 2019; Ferdiana, A.M.K., Darma, G.S., Understanding fintech through go-pay (2019) International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology, 4 (2), pp. 257-260; Zavolokina, L., Dolata, M., Schwabe, G., The FinTech phenomenon: Antecedents of financial innovation perceived by the popular press (2016) Financial Innovation, 2 (1), p. 16; (2016) BI Akan Terbitkan Aturan Main E-wallet, , https://kominfo.go.id/index.php/content/detail/6771/BI+akan+terbitkan+aturan+main+e-wallet/0/sorotan-media, Feb. 15, Accessed on Feb 2019; Iman, N., (2016) Financial Technology Dan Lembaga Keuangan, , Gathering Mitra Linkage Bank Syariah; Dave, C., (2015) Digital Business and ECommercemManagement, , 6th edition © Marketing Insights Limited; De Bel, J., Gâza, M., (2011) Mobile Payments 2012-My Mobile, My Wallet?, , Innopay, Version 1.01; Contini, D., Merritt, C.M., (2011) Mobile Payments in the United States: Mapping Out the Road Ahead.

To achieve its business goals, optimal and integrated information technology will support good quality services. The XYZ University Information System (UIS) provides a variety of information needed by students, lecturers, and all staff. But the system that is running is still experiencing problems in its use that can pose various risks. To prevent that, a risk assessment is carried out on the UIS to identify various possible risks and prevent them by forming a risk management. This research will be conducted using NIST 800-30. This standard is used with the aim of anticipating risks so that the organization does not experience losses. The preparation of UIS information security risk management carried out in this study has succeeded in identifying 32 risk scenarios, prioritizing risks, providing direction in managing risks and accepting processes whether risks are acceptable or should be mitigated. © BEIESP.","Information system risk assessment; NIST 800-30; Risk management; University information system",,,,,,"Mahardika, F., (2017) Manajemen Risiko Keamanan Informasi Menggunakan Framework NIST SP 800-30 Revisi 1, 2 (2), pp. 1-8; Suroso, J.S., Fakhrozi, M.A., Suroso, J.S., Fakhrozi, M.A., ScienceDirect ScienceDirect Assessment Of Information System Risk Management with Octave Assessment Of Information Risk Management with Octave Allegro At System Education (2018) Procedia Comput.

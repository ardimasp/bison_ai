In geographical unit analysis, it refers to the Global Competitiveness Index 2013-2014, based upon World Economic Forum. The mentioned theoretical aspects are further equipped with the empirical aspects in Pharmaceutical Industry, as Industry unit analysis. The mentioned Industry in this paper explores the usage of ServQUAL as relates to Information System Quality, known as Hyperion and Oracle, in the case study of PT. Anugrah Argon Medica. The analysis in this paper provides also the analysis using ARENA Simulation Software. Simultaneously the ServQUAL is deemed as the methodology in this paper, using questionnaire with its 44 items and is divided into two sections, each section covering 22 questions to represent the perceived level analysis of employees and level of expectation. The result of this paper continues to the stage of questionnaire into the analysis of expectation versus perception level of users using existing information systems of the company as the case study. The mentioned results are related to the objectives of this paper to increase 33% as compare to the current systems to the appropriate level of information systems usage that eventually increase customer satisfaction. © Research India Publications.","Expectation versus perception level; Industrial engineering; Information system; Pharmaceutical industry; ServQUAL",,,,,,"Abugabah, A., Sanzogni, L., Poropat, A., (2010) The Impact of Information Systems on User Performance: A Critical Review and Theoretical Model, 1, pp. 1-13; (2009), http://www.anugrah-argon.com/index.php/aam-at-a-glance/thejourney, History of Company, obtained July 20th 2013; Ariani, Dorothea, W., (1999) Manajemen Kualitas, pp. 3-7. , Yogyakarta: Andi Offset; (2010), www.e-myth.com/cs/user/print/post/yourinnovation-criteria-checklist, Your Innovation Criteria List, obtained September 19th 2013; Foster, S.T., (2004) Managing Quality: An Integrative Approach, pp. 215-228. , Second Edition, New Jersey: Prentice Hall; Goestch, D.L., Quality Management: Introduction to Total Quality Management for Productions (2003) Processing, and Services, pp. 3-50. , New Jersey: Prentice Hall; Jogulu, U.D., Wood, G.J., (2006) The Role of Leadership Theory in Raising the Profile in Management, 25, pp. 236-250; Munhurrun, R.P., Bhiwajee, D., Naidoo, P., (2010) Service Quality in the Public Service, 3, pp. 1-14; Parasuraman, A., Zeithaml, V.A., Berry, L.L., (1985) A Conceptual Model of Service Quality and Its Implications for Future Research, 49, pp. 41-50; Satzinger, J.W., (2005) Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with the Unified Process, pp. 6-7. , Thomson Course Technology; Sekaran, U., (2003), Research Methods for Business, A Skill Building Approach, USA: John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Shneiderman, B., (2010) Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction, pp. 86-89. , Fifth Edition, Pearson; (2010) Metode Penelitian Bisnis, pp. 176-192. , Bandung: Alfabeta; Whitten, J.L., (2004) System Analysis and Design Methods, , New York: McGrawHill; http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-competitiveness-report-2013-2014, The Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014, retrieved October 17th 2013",,,,"Research India Publications",,,,,09734562,,,,"English","Int.

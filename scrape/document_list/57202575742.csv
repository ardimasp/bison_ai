Personal health is obtained by maintaining regular diet and exercise. However, because of the lack of public knowledge about balanced food intake and calorie requirements for daily activities, it is difficult for the community to determine the amount of calories consumed and burned. The author proposes the concept of a system that integrates Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)-based gym and logistics to solve this problem. This research methodology uses a systematic literature review. The results of this study are the big picture of service-based architecture which consists of nine layers, namely profile, order, catalog, payment, shipping, chat, diary, promotion and gym inventory. © 2019 IEEE.","Calorie Control Application; integration; Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)","Computer architecture; Information services; Integration; Nutrition; Control applications; Daily activity; Food intake; Personal health; Public knowledge; Research methodologies; Service-based; Systematic literature review; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,"(2015) Hanya 27% Penduduk Indonesia Rutin Berolahraga, , https://databoks.katadata.co.id/datapublish/2016/11/10/hanya-27-penduduk-Indonesia-rutin-berolahraga, Badan Pusat Statistik BPS.

This application is designed by using a Waterfall Model, a 5-phase model that is Communication, Planning, Modeling, Construction, and Deployment starting from as the aforementioned steps. Based on the responds we get from distributing questionnaire, many people didn't know how to exercise properly and didn't bother to check the calories of their food. Their weight is also a problem because most of them still have an Overweight or Underweight status. From those responds, we can conclude that our application will indeed help people to get and maintain their ideal body weight. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Food calorie; Ideal body weight; Waterfall model",,,,,,"Sparling, P.B., Howard, B.J., Dunstan, D.W., Owen, N., Recommendations for physical activity in older adults (2015) Bmj, 350, pp. h100-h100; Patki, S.M., Madhavi, P., Reddy, B.C., Madhavi, K.V.P., (2014) knowledge and attitude regarding dietary habits among secondary school children in khammam town, 3, pp. 3468-3475; Dixon, J.B., (2010) Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology The effect of obesity on health outcomes, 316, pp. 104-108; (2013), Singapore Management University; Digital Media in Indonesia; Nandkishor, B.R., Android Smartphone Based Body Area Network for Monitoring and Evaluation of Medical Parameters (2014) Architecture ABAN, pp. 284-288; Fling, B., (2009) Mobile Design and Development, , United State of America: O'Reilly Media; Safaat, N., (2014) Android: Pemrograman Aplikasi Mobile Smartphone Dan Tablet Pc Berbasis Android, , Bandung: INFORMATIKA; Connolly, T., Begg, C., (2015) Database Systems: A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation, and Management, , London: Pearson Education; Welling, L., Thomson, L., (2009) PHP and MySQL® Web Development, , United State of America: Addison-Wesley; Adams, E., (2014) Fundamentals of Game Design, , 3rd ed; Shneiderman, B., Plaisant, C., (2010) Designing the user interface: strategies for effective human-computer-interaction, , 5th ed.

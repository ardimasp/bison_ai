This study aims to analyze the CLIL Synchronization in BIPA (Indonesian for Foreign Speakers) learning, for speaking skill particularly, at the elementary level in BINUS University context. The study provided an exploratory and micro-study that emphasized on qualitative investigation design. Based on the data collection to 22 selected students, the study captured the CLIL Synchronization by transitioning English to Indonesian Language both within the contextual settings and educational pathways in BIPA module. The results pointed out that the students were positive in bilingual education or immersion in order to scaffold the content learning and language innovative fusion. This study, therefore, recommended a cultural adjustment phenomenon that permeated in diverse topics to synchronize the CLIL in BIPA learning. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Bilingualism; BINUS; BIPA; CLIL; Immersion; Needs analysis; Synchronization",,,,,,"Meyer, O., Introducing the CLIL-pyramid: Key strategies and principles for quality CLIL planning and teaching (2010) Basic Issues in Efl-Teaching and Learning, , edited by M.

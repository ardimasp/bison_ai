Inability to understand financial concepts and risks may lead to wrong decision making then further worsen someone's financial condition. Therefore financial literacy became significant knowledge to have. This financial literacy should be supported by some mechanism to record, monitor, and control an individual financial activity. This study observed the potential value of an mobile-based application “Manage on Money (MoM)” to solve those problem. MoM has three main features for each of those problems. First, “Add Income” and “Add Expense” menu, which is implemented using Google Vision Cloud API Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This menu helps the user record their income and expenses. Second, “Buy or Bye” menu, which is utilizing 50/20/30 budgetting rule. This menu helps the user control their budget usage. Third, “Recurring Transaction” menu, which is implemented using OneSignal API. This menu helps the user monitor their regularly expense and notify them during the due date. Overall score of over than 3 out of 4 was given by the respondent as evaluation of Manage on Money performances and usefulness. © 2019 The Authors.

Many previous studies had demonstrated that the vibration-based technique has potential to detect damages on roads. This research explores the potential use of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for detecting road anomalies based on vehicle accelerometer data. The vehicle is equipped with a smart-phone that has a 3D accelerometer and geo-location sensors. Then, the vehicle is used to scan road network having several road anomalies, such as, potholes, speedbump, and expansion joints. An ANN model consisting of three layers is developed to classify the road anomalies. The first layer is the input layer containing six neurons. The numbers of neurons in the hidden layer is varied between one and ten neurons, and its optimal number is sought numerically. The prediction accuracy of 84.9% is obtained by using three neurons in conjunction with the maximum acceleration data in x, y, and z-axis. The accuracy increases slightly to 86.5%, 85.2%, and 85.9% when the dominant frequencies in x, y, and z-axis, respectively, are taken into account beside the previous data. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Accelerometer; Artificial neural network; Damaged road; Smart-phone; Vibration-based",,,,,,"Undang-undang Republik Indonesia Nomor 22 Tahun 2009 Tentang Lalu Lintas dan Angkutan Jalan (2009); Jiaqiu, W., Songlin, M., Li, J., Research on automatic identification method of pavement sag deformation (2009) Proc. of the 9th Intl.

In this study, an attempt to employ 2nd level Wavelet Based Color Histogram (WBCH) on a CBIR system is proposed. Image database used in this study are taken from Wang's image database containing 1000 color images.

Result shows that LAWS provides better accuracy than other similar method such as GLCM.

Moreover, frequent change in network quality is another issue that should be limited to run the real fast cloud game. Thus, reliable software components between cloud and user devices as clients, including using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as machine learning, deep learning and so on will enhance the game performance, particularly in multiplayer and real-time conditions. In this paper, we list the mobile cloud game architecture in the high-performance computing (HPC) environment, where a load of the game will be distributed between servers as cloud and clients. The server node as clouds or clients will consist of more than one server with many processors (cores) or sometimes can be recognized as distributed computing. Using HPC for cloud games will boost the game performance where the execution times will be dispersed not only in some node in servers and clients but in many cores of each server or client. The involvement of the internet of things (IoT) and ubiquitous access from heterogeneous devices will give benefit to enjoyment in the game itself. © 2020, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Cloud gaming; Distributed cloud game; HPC cloud game; HPC mobile cloud game; Mobile cloud game",,,,,,"Mell, P., Granee, T., The NIST definition of cloud computing (2011) NIST-National Institute of Standards and Technology, , https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf, [Online].

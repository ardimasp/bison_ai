Regarding the context of humor in the political setting, humor can be used as a means of increasing morale and hope for individuals who feel discontent with the current political climate. Poking fun at politics has become even more widespread with the help of the Internet, which provides a medium in which different varieties of political humor are more easily accessible to the public. This study investigates the role of political humor appreciation types in predicting political dogmatism. The predictive-correlational design was conducted on 128 university students (67 males, 61 females; Mean of Age = 22.27 years old; Standard Deviation of Age = 3.33 years) in Greater Jakarta, Indonesia, recruited through convenience sampling technique. Multiple linear regression results showed that appreciation of the benign humor type has an inverse predictive relationship with political dogmatism. In contrast, appreciation of the subversive and undermining humor types can predict dogmatism in positive directions. Appreciation of the supportive humor type does not play a role in the dynamic of political dogmatism. The practical implication of this study is that the strategic use of each type of political humor needs to be carefully arranged so as not to be counterproductive. © Common Ground Research Networks, Kharisma Murti, Tommy Prayoga, Juneman Abraham, Tirta Nugraha Mursitama, All Rights Reserved.","Appreciation; Dogmatism; Political Humor",,,,,,"Abraham, J., Pane, M.M., The mediating role of social competition identity management strategy in the predictive relationship between susceptibility to social influence, internet privacy concern, and online political efficacy (2014) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8407, pp. 492-499. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-55032-4_50; Abraham, J., Prayoga, T., Takwin, B., Political psychology of Indonesian political figure: A case study of a political entrepreneur who is not hesitant in paving a new way (2018) International Journal of Research Studies in Psychology, 7 (1), pp. 35-58. , https://doi.org/10.5861/ijrsp.2018.1863; Afrianty, D., (2016) Islam and Politics: Indonesia'S Identity Crisis, , http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/11/islam-politics-indonesia-identity-crisis-161121082414557.html, Aljazeera, November 22; Antawirya, A., (2013) Interview with The Corruptor, , https://ahmadantawirya.wordpress.com/2013/03/07/218/; Applegate, M., Cohen, J., Communicating graphically: Mimesis, visual language, and commodification as culture (2017) Cultural Politics, 13 (1), pp. 81-100. , https://doi.org/10.1215/17432197-3755204; Aritonang, M.S., Sapiie, M.A., Heriyanto, D., #Jenderalkardus vs. #Jenderalbaper: Twitterati mock prabowo, SBY in upset fallout (2018) The Jakarta Post, , http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/08/09/jenderalkardus-vs-jenderalbaper-twitterati-mock-prabowo-sby-in-upset-fallout.html, August 9; (2018) “'Apa Urusan Anda Menanyakan Itu' Dan Hal Lain Soal Wawancara Edy Rahmayadi” ['What Your Business Is About by Asking That' and Other Things About The Interview with Edy Rahmayadi], , https://www.bbc.com/indonesia/trensosial-45637696, BBC Indonesia; Bippus, A., Factors predicting the perceived effectiveness of politicians' use of humor during a debate (2007) Humor-International Journal of Humor Research, 20 (2), pp. 105-121. , https://doi.org/10.1515/HUMOR.2007.006; CAMEO Fun Campaign: Jokowi Presiden (2014) YouTube Video, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vi5l7h_YQx4; Fun Campaign: Prabowo Jokowi (2014) YouTube Video, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hITLHh0flPoandt=348s, -; Colom, G.G., Alcover, C.T., Sánchez-Curto, C., Zárate-Osuna, J., Study of the effect of positive humor as a variable that reduces stress: Relationship of humor with personality and performance variables (2011) Psychology in Spain, 15 (1), pp. 9-21; Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T., (2004) Introduction to Political Psychology, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Damanik, C., (2018) “Kronologi Kasus Meiliana Yang Dipenjara Karena Keluhkan Pengeras Suara Azan” [The Chronology of Case of Meiliana Who Was Imprisoned for Complaining Azan Loudspeakers], , https://regional.kompas.com/read/2018/08/23/15053451/kronologi-kasus-meiliana-yang-dipenjara-karena-keluhkan-pengeras-suara-azan, Kompas, August 23; Dewberry, D.R., Fox, R., Easy as 1, 2, 3: Rick Perry and self-deprecation as image restoration (2012) Journal of Contemporary Rhetoric, 2 (1), pp. 1-10; Ebbighausen, R., Indonesia is on the brink of disaster (2017) Deutsche Welle, , http://www.dw.com/en/indonesia-is-on-the-brink-of-disaster/a-37528124; Fadhil, H., PPP-NasDem-PSI nilai prabowo 'the winter soldier' cuma ikut-ikutan” [PPP-NasDem-PSI judged the prabowo's 'the winter soldier' to be just a conforming expression] (2018) DetikNews, , https://news.detik.com/berita/4261734/ppp-nasdem-psi-nilai-prabowo-the-winter-soldier-cuma-ikut-ikutan, October 18; Ferguson, M.A., Ford, T.E., Disparagement humor: A theoretical and empirical review of psychoanalytic, superiority, and social identity theories (2008) Humor: International Journal of Humor Research, 21 (3), pp. 283-312. , https://doi.org/10.1515/humor.2008.014; Ford, T.E., Ferguson, M.A., Social consequences of disparagement humor: A prejudiced norm theory (2004) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 8 (1), pp. 79-94. , https://doi.org/10.1207/S15327957PSPR0801_4; (2017) “Ternyata Raja Salman Dukung Ahok” [It Turned Out That King Salman Supported Ahok], , https://twitter.com/gerilyapolitik/status/836874963110014977, GerilyaPolitik. @GerilyaPolitik; Gibbons, S., How to include politics in your marketing without turning anyone off (2017) Entrepreneur, , https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/292018, March 28; Gross, R., (2010) Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behavior, , 6th ed.

Previous studies have identified variables that predict impulse buying, but not many of them have examined the human's self. This study aimed at investigating the roles of insecure self-engulfed self and perceived aesthetic of online shop in predicting the online impulse buying. The participants were 285 private sector employees (156 males and 129 females; Mean of the age of 27.1 years old; Standard deviation of the age of 5.9 years) in the Greater Jakarta, Indonesia. Data analysis using multiple linear regression analysis showed that empirical data supported the positive prediction hypotheses. An additional descriptive analysis applying the Terror Management Theory showed that participants with higher mortality salience tend to have more online buying experience, and they are inclined to purchase more luxurious items such as jewelry and expensive watch than participants with lower mortality salience. This study contributes to developing the interdisciplinary field of psychological science and information technology by integrating the self and the virtual medium of shopping variables as well as by recommending behavioral engineering to control online impulse buying. © International Journal on Advanced Science Engineering Information Technology.","Aesthetic; Business psychology; Impulsive buying; Mortality salience; Online; Self",,,,,,"Lu, Z., Wang, S., Li, X., Yang, L., Yang, D., Wu, D., ""Online shop location optimization using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision model-Case study on Taobao.com,"" (2012) Knowl-Based Syst, 32, pp. 76-83; ""Meningkatnya pertumbuhan belanja online di pasar negara berkembang-portal lengkap dunia marketing,"" (2012) Portal Lengkap Dunia Marketing, , http://www.marketing.co.id/meningkatnya-pertumbuhan-belanjaonline-di-pasar-negara-berkembang/, [Accessed: 14-Dec-2016]; Marketing, D.I., (2016) ""E-commerce usage in Indonesia 2016,"", , http://www.dionlinesurvey.com/en/2016/09/23/e-commerce-usage-in-indonesia-2016/, DI Marketing Online.

For example, IoT in health domain comes a long way than just helping individuals regulate their body. It has enabled many social functions that connect users to serve more health related purposes. However, in Indonesia, as such an idea is still novel, there is a need to examine how is it being represented in health context to increase health capabilities. We asked 241 college students across Greater Jakarta (17-25 years old; Mean of age = 20.47 years old; Standard deviation of age = 1.469 years; 83 males, 158 females) 10 questions to measure their Social Representation towards IoT in the health domain. This is a descriptive research, and the instrument for data collecting is a questionnaire. The data obtained were analyzed using Voyant tool to generate words cirrus for every answer. The result showed that although participants generally perceive that IoT in health domain is potentially beneficial and can be used to increase health capabilities, there are a few practical agency freedom limitations, such as individual dispositions and economic status. © 2016 IEEE.","Health Capability; Internet of Things; Psychotechnology; Representation","Health; Information systems; Students; College students; Data collecting; Economic status; Psychotechnology; Representation; Social function; Social representations; Standard deviation; Internet of things",,,,,"Prayoga, T., Abraham, J., Behavioral intention to use iot health device: The role of perceived usefulness, facilitated appropriation, big five personality traits, and cultural value orientations (2016) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE), 6 (4), pp. 1751-1765; Whitmore, A., Agarwal, A., Da Xu, L., The internet of things - A survey of topics and trends (2015) Inf.

Using path analysis, it was found that mathematics self-efficacy and appreciation towards history of mathematics can predict statistics appropriation, while ambiguity tolerance can predict previous bad mathematics experience. Finally, both statistics appropriation and previous bad mathematics experience can predict attitude towards statistics, thus confirming the hypothesized model.

Especially in the healthcare sector, IoT health devices have a great impact on individual's health-regulation. Through many beneficial features from tracking sleep patterns to calories intake measure, individuals will gain a better understanding of their body to keep them healthy. However, benefits do not immediately equal users' acceptance. In this study, we seek to find variables that we propose could predict user's intention to use IoT health device and integrate them into a theoretical model. We analyzed user's technology acceptance from the perspective of Technology Acceptance Model, using Perceived Usefulness as the main predictor for Behavioral Intention. We also integrate Personality Traits and Facilitated Appropriation as factors to determine Perceived Usefulness, and finally using Cultural Value Orientations at the individual level, we seek to determine the antecedents of Facilitated Appropriation. The research design was predictive correlational with path analysis statistical technique. Participants of this study were 186 college students (75 males, 111 females; mean = 20.86 years old, standard deviation = 2.01 years) across Greater Jakarta. The results showed that Perceived Usefulness can predict Behavioral Intention to use the device. However, Personality Traits are found to be irrelevant in predicting Perceived Usefulness. Only Facilitated Appropriation predicts Perceived Usefulness. Among cultural values proposed, only the Long-term Orientation predicts user's tendency to engage in Facilitated Appropriation. Also, we did not find any correlation between age and Behavioral Intention, Perceived Usefulness, and Facilitated Appropriation. Copyright © 2016 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

There are three social intervention solutions conducted during October 2014 to January 2015 in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, as part of Social Psychology and Psychological Intervention Course Program that will be discussed in detail, namely 1) intervention toward the observer’s (bystander’s) attitude toward the violence to be a preventer of the violence (or, to be an upstander), 2) intervention eliminating women objectification among men, and 3) intervention reducing verbal violent behavior against women. All those three will be discussed in an intervention methods of PATH, a model constructed by Abraham P. Buunk and Mark Van Vugt (2013) consisting of four stages, i.e. Problem formulation (Problem), Analysis and explanation (Analyze), Test stages (Test) and Intervention implementation (Help). The intervention targets are the students, the late teens, and the young adults through 1) Handbook of Violence Prevention to offer support and assistance for the actual and potential victims of domestic violence, 2) the campaign via radio mass media for prevention of women objectification, as well as 3) the delivery of contemplative messages through shirt and pin for verbal abuse prevention. © 2015, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

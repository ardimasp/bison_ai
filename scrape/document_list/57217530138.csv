A university's commitment to quality, has pushed to implement a quality management system to maintain the overall education program that has been built. With strategic planning and university business management processes, designing an Enterprise Architecture (EA) as an architectural basic for providing data for the analysis of university management conditions using big data technology and data analytics is the answer. So that information can support rapid decision-making process in business management. This study uses the Value Chain method to analyze business processes, and the Zachman Framework approach to detail the needs of enterprise architecture, with the highest goal of this research is to produce Enterprise Architecture design and management blueprints. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

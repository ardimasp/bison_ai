It is also what programmers spend much time on. Therefore, many tools to ease the user interface development are available. Many of them are part of integrated development environment (IDE) of programming languages. Some of them are more generic and available for a few user interface toolkits or programming languages. However, these tools usually assume their users are targeting specific platform: desktop, web, or mobile application. While generic tools are sometimes generous enough, they usually cannot make it totally independent of underlying toolkit or programming languages. Modeling tools exist, but it means learning something new. This is one of the backgrounds for what we propose in this paper. An application user interface model based on spreadsheet: software packages that have been around for almost four decades. We emphasize multiplatform output: design once and output in several platforms (we provide two: desktop and web; adaptable to more). We do not assume a specific toolkit or programming language, but we still care about styles. Our experiments prove this method is usable and results in quicker user interface prototyping—even for professional programmers—with development time comparison ranging from 26.7% (best) to 80%. © BEIESP.","Code generation; Programming language; Spreadsheet; User interface; User interface modeling",,,,,,"Dr. Ford Lumban Gaol is currently Associate Professor Informatics Engineering and Information System, Bina Nusantara University.

Depending on the experiences and languages, developing a web application could be a simple or complex task. It is complex because the programmer should use more than one languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, language at the server side, and others). To reduce the number of languages, programmers may use domain-specific languages. The more specific the language, the simpler the development could be. However, some researches show that language specificity itself could be another challenge. Therefore, to make web application development simpler and at the same time make the domain-specific language useful, more research is needed. We propose the usage of spreadsheet – software packages that have been around for about four decades. We emphasize simple modeling technique, combined with column/row based syntax, saved as comma-separated values (CSV) file format, which can be interpreted as a fully functional web application. Experiments prove this method is usable and results in simpler web application development with significantly less development time (43%) and lines of code (30%) compared with standard web technologies.

The first two offer more flexibilities but greatly differ in complexities. General-purpose language is probably overkill for a simple data entry application. In order to be useful, domain-specific language should be as close as possible to the problem domain and still open to research. This paper presents Perkedel, a domain-specific programming language designed for data entry. It is inspired by spreadsheet concept and offers user interface definitions that resemble a paper-based data entry form. Spreadsheet is one of the most popular programming systems that has been around us for almost four decades and we argue that easy user interface definition is important. This results in writing source code for a data entry application that looks nothing like ordinary source code. This speeds up the development time, too. One of our respondents spent only five minutes to a develop a simple data entry application, compared to the fastest development time of 32 minutes using a generalpurpose language, for similar application. That way, we hope that Perkedel may add a little perk to data entry developer's life using this data entry language. © 2017 IEEE.","data entry; domain-specific programming language; programming language; spreadsheet","Ada (programming language); Artificial intelligence; Computer programming languages; Data acquisition; Problem oriented languages; Spreadsheets; Development time; Domain specific languages; Domain specific programming languages; General purpose languages; General-purpose programming language; Problem domain; Programming system; Source codes; User interfaces",,,,,,"Soewito, N.B., Gaol, F.L., Abbas, B.S., Multi-platform application user interface design (2017) The International Conference on Advanced Management and Information Technology Service; Van Deursen, A., Klint, P., Domain-specific language design reqires feature description (2002) Journal of Computing and Information Technology, 10 (1), pp. 1-7; Van Deursen, A., Klint, P., Visser, J., (2000) Domain-Specific Language: An Annotated Bibliography, Sigplan Notices, 35 (6), pp. 26-36; Ayalew, Y., Clermont, M., Mittermeir, R.T., Detecting Errors in Spreadsheets, , arXiv preprint arXiv: 0805.1740, 2008; Abraham, R., Burnett, M., Erwig, M., Spreadsheets programming (2008) Wiley Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Engineering; Power, D.J., A brif history of spreadsheets (2004) DSSResources.Com; Nardi, B.A., Miller, J.R., (1990) The Spreadsheets Interface: A Basic for End User Programming, , Hewlett-Packard Laboratories; Sebesta, R.W., (2012) Concepts of Programming Language, , 10 th ed, Pearson Education Inc; Spinellis, D., Notable design patterns for domain specific language (2001) Journal of Systems and Software, 56 (1), pp. 91-99; Mernik, M., Heering, J., Sloane, A.M., When and how to develop domain specific language (2005) ACM Comuting Surveys (CSUR), 37 (4), pp. 316-344",,,"IEEE Indonesia","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2017 IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Computational Intelligence, CyberneticsCOM 2017","20 November 2017 through 22 November 2017",,135216,,9781538607831,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Nevertheless, perspective distortion is unavoidable when taking pictures of the plate number. Another factor that causes inaccuracy is the distance of the camera from the plate number. To solve these problems, we propose a new method to automatically detect and recognize vehicle plate number with regards to perspective distortion and distance of capturing plate number. We used zonal density with Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. We tested our algorithm on 21 vehicles plate number with 1, 3, and 5 meter of capturing distance.

However, formula definition is often considered correct after tested with only one or few inputs. This may be fine with simple formula, but for more complex ones, more testings should be performed, in order to prevent solution that riddled with errors. However, writing a formula test case in spreadsheet software is not a simple task, mainly because there is no standard way to do that. In this paper, a simple spreadsheet test case application is proposed. User can define a formula, with many input variants, along with expected results. After that, application will generate a spreadsheet document, with all the needed contents for testing, along with test result. That way, user may re-check the formula and make necessary modifications (then run the test, again). Using this method, a formula can be tested first, with many input as needed, before it put in real document. All of these will impact in more productive programmers, with less time spent for debugging. © 2016 IEEE.","end-user programming; end-user software engineering; formula; spreadsheet; spreadsheet test case; testing","Application programs; Computer programming; Software engineering; Spreadsheets; Testing; End user programming; End-user software engineering; formula; Spreadsheet software; Test case; Time spent; Software testing",,,,,,"Abraham, R., Erwig, M., GoalDebug: A spreadsheet debugger for end users (2007) Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 251-260. , IEEE Computer Society, May; Abraham, R., Erwig, M., UCheck: A spreadsheet type checker for end users (2007) Journal of Visual Languages & Computing, 18 (1), pp. 71-95; Antoniu, T., Steckler, P.A., Krishnamurthi, S., Neuwirth, E., Felleisen, M., Validating the unit correctness of spreadsheet programs (2004) Software Engineering, 2004, ICSE 2004.

Bina Nusantara (BINUS) University has implemented Knowledge Management System (KMS) since 2002. This study examined the speed performance of content creation in four modules of BINUS University KMS: Documents, Video, Material, and Binuspedia. The examined to get mean value of speed performance was conducted in 3 location campuses of BINUS University: Anggrek Campus, Syahdan Campus and Alam Sutera Campus, each was done with five repetition. The speed performance was analyzed using Two-way ANOVA with interaction approach. According to the experiment results, F calculated for module is greater than F table, F calculated for campus is less than F table and F calculated for interaction is less than F table. Thus, the conclusions are: (1) there are differences in the average value of speed performance for each module, (2) there is no difference in the average value of speed performance for each campus, and (3) there is no interaction between campuses and modules on the speed performance. © 2016 IEEE.","BINUS University; Knowledge Management System; Speed Performance; Two Way ANOVA with Interaction","Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Bins; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Average values; BINUS University; Content creation; F tables; Knowledge management system; Mean values; Speed performance; Two-way ANOVA; Speed",,,,,,"Gourova, E., Toteva, K., Design of knowledge management systems (2015) Proc. 20th Eur.

And, if needed, multiple applications may work with same SQLite database, optionally, using filesystem sharing services. However, file sharing option is not always available and reliable in certain conditions. In this paper, we propose a server for SQLite database. This server will be using HTTP as communication protocol. To enable multiuser application, this server will be multithreaded. However, access to the database file will be synchronized to help prevent database corruption. And, as data-interchange format, JSON will be used. We also run several tests to make sure that proposed server is usable. Test results show that the database file is not corrupted, while still maintain acceptable performance. © 2017 Global IT Research Institute - GiRI.","Concurrent programming; Database server; Embedded database; HTTP server; Multithreaded application","Computer programming; Distributed computer systems; HTTP; Hypertext systems; Acceptable performance; Concurrent programming; Data interchange format; Data-base servers; Embedded database; Multi-threaded application; Multi-user applications; Multiple applications; Database systems",,,,,,"About SQLite, , https://sqlite.org/about.html, The SQLite Development Team; SQLite Frequently Asked Questions, , https://sqlite.org/faq.html, The SQLite Development Team; Owens, M., Embedding an SQL database with SQLite (2003) Linux Journal, (110), p. 2; Most Widely Deployed SQL Database Engine, , https://sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html, The SQLite Development Team; Fielding, R., (1999) Hypertext Transfer protocol-HTTP/1.1 (No. RFC 2616); Nurseitov, N., (2009) Comparison of JSON and XML Data Interchange Formats: A Case Study, pp. 157-162. , Caine; JSON Developer, , http://www.json.org; Fielding, R., Reschke, J., (2014) Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing; Implementation Limits for SQLite, , https://www.sqlite.org/limits.html, The SQLite Development Team; Burnim, J., Sen, K., Asserting and checking determinism for multithreaded programs (2009) Proceedings of the the 7th Joint Meeting of the European Software Engineering Conference and the ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering, pp. 3-12. , August, ACM; SQLite: Documentation, , http://www.sqlite.org/src/doc/trunk/ext/userauth/user-auth.txt, The SQLite Development Team; Noprianto, Simple Web SQLite Manager/Form/Report Application, , https://github.com/nopri/sqliteboy; PostgreSQL: Documentation: Devel: Frontend-Backend Protocol, , https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/protocol.html, The PostgreSQL Global Development Group; Noprianto, Soewito, B., Pangsit: Spreadsheet-like domain-specific programming language for data entry application development (2016) The Eleventh 2016 International Conference on Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems (KICSS)",,,"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI);et al.;Gangwon Convention and Visitors Bureau;IEEE Communication Society (IEEE ComSOc);Korean Institute of Communication Sciences (KICS);National Information Society Agency (NIA)","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","19th International Conference on Advanced Communications Technology, ICACT 2017","19 February 2017 through 22 February 2017",,127106,17389445,9788996865094,,,"English","Int.

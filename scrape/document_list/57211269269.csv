Game play activities are often carried out by children with special needs can be a support learning and therapy due to his players the game has interaction without having to meet with his co-star in person. Starting from these data, this study aims to create a model of the System Dynamics approach. Data collected will be simulated by variables other support. The simulation results of the model will be seen autistic children therapy behavior. The results are then analyzed to create an alternative to the existing model. The benefit of this research is to know the description of game play to treatment of children with special needs. The results of simulation showed that playing games in an average time children with autism play therapy can help improve the quality of children with autism if children with autism play the game in a long time actually showed a decrease. © 2019 IEEE.","action games; autism; children with special need; simulation model; system dynamics","Diseases; Information management; System theory; action games; autism; Simulation model; Special needs; System Dynamics; Computer games",,,,,"(2013) Video Game Use in Boys with Austism Spectrum Disorder, , Community Practitioner.

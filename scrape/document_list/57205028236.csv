Based on the concept and theory of information technology governance framework developed and carried out on the same domain parameters and processes as needed to build the research. Data were collected from questionnaires to 139 respondents. The respondents are active and routine employees using the information system contained at DKI Jakarta forestry service. Data were processed and analyzed using factor analysis method. From the results of data processing there are 5 factors along with the indicators that affect the level of understanding of information system users at DKI Jakarta forestry service. The five factors are strategic planning, maintenance and development, values alignment, user efficiency and response speed. From the evaluation results using the five factors it can be concluded that the governance information system at DKI Jakarta forestry service into the quiet good category. © 2018 IEEE.","budgeting information system; factor analysis; forestry service","Budget control; Data handling; Factor analysis; Forestry; Information use; Management information systems; Multivariant analysis; Surveys; Timber; Domain parameters; Evaluation results; Factor analysis method; Forest Service; Forestry services; Information technology governance; Response speed; User efficiencies; Information management",,,,,"Turban, E., Volonino, L., Wood, G.R., (2015) Information Technology for Management: Digital Strategies for Insight, Action, and Sustainable Performance, , 10th Edition.

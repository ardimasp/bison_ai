Personal healthcare device such as ECG senses very sensitive voltage from heart and stream the data in high speed to the IoT platform. Data from ECG can be used for many disease diagnoses, including Arrhythmia and sleep disorder. In order to obtain the optimum diagnosis result, IoT platform for healthcare should be able to handle very rapid data stream from users or devices simultaneously and keep the successful connections at a high rate. In this paper, an IoT architecture for healthcare implementing asynchronous processing is proposed. Asynchronous process allows the system to process the data outside the main loop of process. The proposed system measures HTTP successful connections and analytics accuracy. By implementing asynchronous processing, the system can increase the successful HTTP connection up to 50% for 100 users testing scenario compared to the benchmark system. The increase of successful connections improves the analytics accuracy to 98.41%. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"Electrocardiography; Health care; HTTP; Asynchronous processing; Benchmark system; Cloud platforms; Disease diagnosis; Health monitoring; Internet of Things (IOT); Iot architectures; Personal health care; Internet of things",,,,"039/VR","Acknowledgments.

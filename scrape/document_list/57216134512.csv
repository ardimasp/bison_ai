Fish is one of the marine wealthties (marine biota), which have large numbers in Indonesia. Fishermen is an important role in the process of fishing, however fish caught by fishermen are often mixed with other types of fish. Currently, the process of fist separation is done manually, which takes longer time and many error occur due to fatigue. In this work the conveyer separator based on the fish identification system is developed. The fish conveyer separator is designed and developed. The fish identification system is based on Fast Fourier Transform (FTT) technique and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The system is working properly, since it resulting the training and testing accuracy of 80% and 66%, respectively. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Artificial Neural Network; Automated Conveyor; Fast Fourier Transform","Conveyors; Fast Fourier transforms; Marine biology; Neural networks; Separators; Fish identification; Indonesia; Marine biota; Marine resources; Training and testing; Fish",,,,,"Ichwan, D., (2010) Potensi Kelautan Indonesia, , http://one-geo.blogspot.com/2010/01/potensi-kelautan-indonesia.html, [Online] [Accessed: 26-Aug-2019]; Ibrahim, M.Y., (2006) Study on Fresh Fish Sorting Techniques; Nandi, C.S., Tudu, B., Koley, C., An automated machine vision based system for fruit sorting and grading (2012) Proc.

Pain is subjective, where each individual has a different pain response, sometimes difficult to express and can only be felt by the individual without being felt by others. Therefore, the assessment of pain for each treatment by medical personnel can be different. This could lead to non-standard handling of patients in pain medical treatment. The automatic stand alone system for pain detection based on face recognition is developed. The system determines patient paint level detector based on facial expression recognition. The face detection is based on face image procession technique and Convolution Neural Network (CNN). The system is working properly, since it resulting the training and testing accuracy of 90% and 70%, respectively. © IEOM Society International.","Artificial Neural Network; Automated stand alone embedded system; Facial expression technique",,,,,,"Aibinu, A.

Complexicity level of company business processes and the need for information that continuously increasing, gave birth to the information system. An integrated information system is called ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning). The advantages of ERP systems lies in how ERP integrates modules between functional or division. This advantage can be considered as weakness if not properly controlled of how each function is connected, but the company ERP system is difficult to control because of their complexity and high cost of ERP systems management. One of applications that support the ERP system is SAP. The purpose of this paper is to evalute SAP-based material management process at distributor which to determine whether the existing business processes, especially in material management module is still relevant or renewals to get maximum results. The method used in the evaluation is the Fit/Gap Analysis and Risk/Analysis. Fit/Gap Analysis identified a process which goes into a fit condition, gap or partial fit. The results of the Fit/Gap analysis can be concluded that the processes running on the distributor has met the needs of the system because of many processes that have been entered into a fit condition. Risk Analysis was used to identify the activities that go into the gap condition. The evaluation can be a reference for further evaluation in the future. © Research India Publications.","Evaluation; Material management; Process; SAP",,,,,,"Fidlerová, H.P., Application of material requirements planning as method for enhancement of production logistics in industrial company (2014) Applied Mechanics and Materials, pp. 49-54; Gonzálvez-Gallego, N.M., Using integrated information systems in supply chain management (2015) Enterprise Information Systems, pp. 210-232; Kilic, H.Z., Selecting ""the best"" ERP system for SMEs using a combination of ANP and PROMETHEE methods (2015) Expert Systems with Applications, pp. 2343-2352; Tsai, W.C., Investigation of the mediating effects of IT governance-value delivery on service quality and ERP performance (2015) Enterprise Information Systems, pp. 139-160",,,,"Research India Publications",,,,,09734562,,,,"English","Int.

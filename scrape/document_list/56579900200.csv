Major food such as rice (Oryzae Sativa). As the main commodity and the increasing demands from year to year, rice production is known to decreased due to high pest and plant diseases. This research is focusing on designing an expert system to diagnosis the diseases of rice plants with bayes' theorem. The Bayesian approach is a powerful statistical procedure in decision support. Expert system in this research is a program that acting as a smart advisor or consultant for equipped the farmers with sufficient knowledge related with plant conditions. Total 19 diseases and 25 symptoms found for data of rice plant diseases and the design of the systems used waterfall approach which start from analysis, system design, coding and testing.

Many studies on e-procurement in the government sector have been conducted, but very few researches that focuses on its impact on good governance. This study conducted to do investigation of success rate of implementation of e-procurement in terms of some of the factors of good governance in the Indonesian government.

The XYZ company met several things problem using the traditional method (face to face), which the students have the limited time met with the instructor. So we proposed the system to solving the current problems in the organization. The purposes of this research is to identify the needs and problem that faced by XYZ. In conducting the research, authors use the field study as method of data collection that consisted of interviews and questionnaires, and using ADDIE Model as a method to analysis and design the system. Based on the questionnaires results, there are several problems, such as XYZ doesn’t have specific media can be accessed anytime to provide course material and also discussion between instructor nor students. Therefore based on the results of the analysis of problems, the next step of this research was designed and built a Learning Management System application for XYZ.","Analysis; Design; Development; Learning Management System; Web","Curricula; Design; Education computing; Problem oriented languages; Surveys; Teaching; Analysis; Case study approach; Course material; Current problems; Data collection; Development; Education sectors; Learning management system; Problem solving",,,,,,"Tavangarian, D., Leypold, M.E., Nölting, K., Röser, M., Voigt, D., Is e-learning the Solution for Individual Learning?

Technology infrastructure well known as a key ingredient of successful knowledge management process in a company and also a strong support to improve the company’s competitive advantage. Technology is rapidly changing, a lot of data from external source will give impact to the company. That’s why with the right technology infrastructure will easy to manage, record, transfer the data become information and knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to know the reason behind, why the company implemented the cloud computing model as a part of technology infrastructure to support knowledge management process in the company. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT & LLS.

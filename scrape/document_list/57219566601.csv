This research aims to study the position of research in the knowledge management studies by Indonesian institutional affiliated researchers published internationally indexed Scopus using a bibliometric perspective. A bibliometric method and analyzed research data were used to evaluate the search results service from Scopus and the VOSviewer application. The data obtained in this study extended to 214 academic documents published from 1999 to 2019. The results demonstrated the most productive Indonesian-affiliated institutions and individual researchers in knowledge management research were the Universitas Indonesia and Dian Indra Sensuse. The areas of study and the most publication sources in knowledge management were the computer science and Journal of Physics Conference Series. There were four collaborative researchers' group maps in Indonesia. This research proposed a convergence axis classification consisting of knowledge management research to characterize the body of knowledge generated from two decades of research: Customer, Organization, Research, Indonesia, Knowledge management systems, Information technology, Risk management, Information dissemination, abbreviated as CORIKIRI themes. © 2020 IEEE.","Bibliometric; Indonesia; Knowledge management; Management","Classification (of information); Information dissemination; Knowledge based systems; Risk management; Bibliometric; Body of knowledge; Environmental change; Indonesia; Knowledge management system; Research data; Knowledge management",,,,"Universitas Airlangga, UNAIR","We thank to Airlangga University for accessing the Scopus database.

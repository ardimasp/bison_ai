These problems are found in the business process of PT XYZ which has a line stop annual recapitulation caused by IT factors for 451 minutes, with the biggest cause at the level of availability of the production process information system server. In maintaining the continuity of its business processes, PT XYZ requires a risk control measure for the main problem, namely improving the quality of the availability of the production process information system server, by building an on-premise replication method suitable for various disaster threats. This study aims to find out the specific steps in determining what replication methods are appropriate to be implemented in a manufacturing environment with the conditions of business needs such as PT XYZ, whose investment feasibility is then evaluated through a systematic approach in the form of a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) method. From the overall results of the analysis process of PT XYZ's business needs, and by utilizing a combination of existing technologies, the appropriate replication method is obtained for the manufacturing environment, then integrating the needs of the Disaster Recovery Center (DRC) system with the infrastructure it has today can produce DRC designs that are more efficient and effective from a technical and cost perspective. © 2020 Little Lion Scientific.

However, many young adults suffer poor sleep due to work or academic demands. Even more, sleep is associated with stress which is many young adults experienced it. To solve this problem, many epidemiologic studies suggest that exercise may improve sleep quality. On the other hand, several studies show that daily activity has no association with sleep quality. In this study, we tried to find more evidence of whether the daily activity has an association with sleep quality or not. We used a commercially available wearable device to capture the subject's heart rate, step count and deep sleep duration for 7 months. Then we used linear regression, XGBoost, and Long Short-Term Memory to find an association between these variables. The results show that there was no association between these variables. © 2020 IEEE.","Heart rate; Physical activity; Sleep quality; Step count; Wearable device","Information management; Wearable technology; Daily activity; Epidemiologic-study; Heart rates; Mental health; Sleep quality; Wearable devices; Young adults; Sleep research",,,,,"Watson, N.F., Recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult: A joint consensus statement of the American academy of sleep medicine and sleep research society (2015) Sleep; Engle-Friedman, M., The effect of sleep loss on next day effort (2003) J.

Because this fish is known to have higher albumin fraction (64.61%) of protein and other economic values, domestication, and cultivation of this fish has been done in many Asian countries such as Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, and India. Environmental factors such as temperature, water pH, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, and turbidity are important parameters must be considered inbreeding and growing this type of fish. The aim of this paper is to propose an IoT solution to automatically monitor these environmental factors. It is designed with affordable and open-source electrical components to provide a cost-efficient solution for farmers. Five sensors are used to measure each parameter. A web application prototype is also presented as a companion application for the users to get useful information from the IoT device. It is developed using a Pythonframework. By accessing this web application, the users can immediately detect any abnormal conditions of the pond. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cultivation; Dissolved oxygen; Fish; Lakes; Abnormal conditions; Asian countries; Economic values; Electrical components; Environmental factors; Freshwater bodies; Total dissolved solids; WEB application; Internet of things",,,,,"Haniffa, M.A.K., Jeya Sheela, P.A., Kavitha, K., Jais, A.M.M., Salutary value of haruan, the striped snakehead Channa striatus - A review (2014) Asian Pac.

The nature of dietary patterns of specific Indonesia population on the risk of colorectal cancer might differ from previously published data with the global population. Therefore, we conducted a study where the dietary pattern in colorectal cancer patient cohorts was compared to age- and population-matched control. We documented 89 colorectal cancer cases and among 173 individuals from the South Sulawesi population. A series of logistic regression and Fisher’s exact tests were utilized to test associations of dietary intakes and colorectal cancer risk as well as colorectal cancer staging. Our data demonstrate that vegetable (p-value = 8.70 × 10−26, OR = 0.49) and fruit (p-value = 7.59x10−5, OR = 0.70) intakes are associated with the reduced risk of colorectal cancer incidence. Conversely, acidic food, reheated food, meat, spicy food, and alcohol are associated with the increment case of cancer. Moreover, meat intake (p-value &lt; 0.01) shows a significant association with cancer staging progression. Common dietary pattern is a determinant aspect to the colorectal cancer incidence as well as its staging progression. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Mundade, R., Imperiale, T.F., Prabhu, L., Loehrer, P.J., Lu, T., Genetic pathways, prevention, and treatment of sporadic colorectal cancer (2014) Oncoscience, 1 (6), pp. 400-406;

Its purpose was to determine the correlation between independent variables consisting of Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Attitude toward Using (AU) with dependent variable Behavioral Intention to Use (BIU). Data collection techniques were carried out by distributing questionnaires through group discussion forums. Respondents consisted of medical workers and health cadres both in Jakarta and Yogyakarta. Data were analyzed using correlation test and t-test. The results of the correlation test state that the correlation between PEU and AU is 0.30, which shows a weak correlation. Meanwhile, the correlation of PU and AU is 0.56, PEU and BIU is 0.41, and PU and BIU is 0.47, which are considered as moderate correlations. Finally, a strong correlation exists between AU and BIU. T-test results show that the effect of PU on AU is statistically significant with CI = 95%. Likewise, the effects of PEU on AU, AU towards BIU, PU towards BIU, and PEU towards BIU are significant (p < 0.05). © Kassel University Press GmbH.","Cancer early detection; Mobile learning; TAM",,,,,,"Dyanti, G.A.R., Suariyani, N.L.P., Faktor-Faktor Keterlambatan Penderita Kanker Payudara Dalam Melakukan Pemeriksaan Awal Ke Pelayanan Kesehatan (2016) Jurnal Kesehatan Masyarakat, 11 (2), pp. 96-104. , https://doi.org/10.15294/kemas.v11i2.3742; Muljo, H.H., Perbangsa, A.S., Pardamean, B., Assessment of Online Learning Application for Health Education (2019) International Journal of Online and Biomedical Engineering, 15 (12), pp. 69-80. , https://doi.org/10.3991/ijoe.v15i12.11157; Setiati, E., (2009) Waspadai Empat Kanker Ganas Pembunuh Wanita, Kanker Rahim, Kanker Indung Telur, Kanker Leher Rahim, Kanker Payudara, , https://doi.org/10.18860/sains.v0i0.1862, Yokyakarta: Andi; Fernández, M.E., DeBor, M., Candreia, J.D.M., Dissemination of a breast and cervical cancer early detection program through a network of community-based organizations (2010) Health Promotion Practice, 11 (5), pp. 654-664. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839908325064; Ngoc Nguyen, T.-U., Tanjasiri, S.P., Kagawa-Singer, M., Tran, J.H., Foo, M.A., Community Health Navigators for Breast-and Cervical-Cancer Screening Among Cambodian and Laotian Women: Intervention Strategies and Relationship-Building Processes (2008) Health Promotion Practice, 9 (4), pp. 356-367. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839906290251; Muljo, H.H., Pardamean, B., Perbangsa, A.S., The implementation of online learning for early detection of cervical cancer (2017) Journal of Computer Science, 13 (11), pp. 600-607. , https://doi.org/10.3844/jcssp.2017.600.607; Davis, F.D., Perceived Usefullness, Perceived Ease of Use, and User Acceptance of Information Technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3). , https://doi.org/10.2307/249008; Quinn, C., (2000) MLearning, , Mobile, Wireless, In-Your-Pocket Learning.

If more products are purchased by customers then the salary received is also higher. One of important issue in PT. XYZ is how to choose which products are now being sought/searched by the customer. The goal of this paper is to create a system and report that can help marketing to choose which product suitable to be offered to customer. This paper proposes a data warehouse development through methodology designed by Kimball and Ross. Furthermore, the data can be analyzed using OLAP and then displayed on the dashboard. With this business solution, PT. XYZ can process and choose what kind of products are suitable for customer relatively faster. The result shows that the system can choose which products are suitable to be offered to customer from the dashboard display. © 2018 IEEE.","business solution; data warehouse; ETL; star schema","Commerce; Compensation (personnel); Data warehouses; Pattern recognition; Business solutions; Data warehouse development; Marketing IS; Star schema; Sales",,,,,"Ponniah, P., (2001) Data Warehousing Fundamentals, , vol. 10.1002/0471221627, New Jersey: Wiley Blackwell; El-Sappagh, S.H.A., Hendawi, A.M.A., El Bastawissy, A.H., A proposed model for data warehouse ETL processes (2011) Journal of King Saud University-Computer and Information Sciences, pp. 91-104; Atay, C.E., Alp, G., Modeling and querying multidimensional bitemporal (2015) International Journal of Computer and Communication Engineering, pp. 110-119; Chandra, P., Gupta, M.K., Comprehensive survey on data warehousing research (2017) International Journal of Information Technology; Mali, N.S., A survey of ETL tools (2015) International Journal of Computer Techniques, 2 (5), pp. 20-27; Gad, D.I., Manjunatha, B., Hybrid data warehouse model for climate big data analysis (2017) International Conference on Circuit, Power and Computing Technologies, Kollam; Mukherjee, R., Kar, P., A comparative review of data warehousing ETL tools with new trends and industry insight (2017) IEEE 7th International Advance Computing Conference, , Hyderabad; Prakash, G.H., Rangdale, P., ETL data conversion: Extraction, transformation and loading data conversion (2017) International Journal of Engineering and Computer Science, pp. 22545-22550; Sabtu, A., Azmi, N., Sjarif, N.N.A., Ismail, S.A., Yusop, O.M., Sarkan, H., Chuprat, S., The challenges of extract, transform and loading (ETL) system implementation for near real-time environment (2017) International Conference on Research and Innovation in Information Systems, Langkawi; Villar, A., Zarrabeitia, M.T., Fdez-Arroyabe, P., Santurtún, A., Integrating and analyzing medical and environmental data using ETL and business intelligence tools (2017) International Journal of Biometeorology; Das, T.K., Mohapatro, A., A study on big data integration with data warehouse (2014) International Journal of Computer Trends and Technology, 9, pp. 188-192; Vaisman, A., Zimányi, E., (2014) Data Warehouse Systems: Design and Implementation, , London: Springer; Prakoso, C.W., Girsang, A.S., Data warehouse development for customer WIFI (2017) International Journal on Communications Antenna and Propagation, 7 (2), pp. 114-124; Tagirova, K.F., Ramazanov, A.R., Data warehouse for intelligent oil wells control systems (2017) IEEE, St. Petersburg, Russia; Abdulaziz, T., Moawad, I., Abu-Alam, W.M., Decision support system utilizing data warehouse technique for the tourism sector in Egypt (2015) The 7th International Conference on Information Technology, , Amman, Jordan; Moalla, I., Nabli, A., Bouzguenda, L., Hammami, M., Data warehouse design from social media for opinion analysis: The case of facebook and twitter (2016) 2016 IEEE/ACS 13th International Conference of Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA), , Agadir, Morocco; Kraus, C., Valverde, R., A data warehouse design for the detection of fraud in the supply chain by using the Benford's Law (2014) American Journal of Applied Sciences, 11 (9), pp. 1507-1518; Martins, D., Ramos, C., Rodrigues, J., Cardoso, P., Lam, R., Serra, F., Challenges in building a big data warehouse applied to the hotel business intelligence (2015) 6th Int.

Some predictions are made only by using historical currency data to be predicted, this makes predictions less accurate because they do not consider external influences. This study examines external factors that can influence the results of predictions, by looking for the relationship between the value of indices such as NTFSE and S & P 500 and the value of commodities such as gold and silver to the prediction process of EUR / USD. Prediction carried out using a deep learning algorithm with the Convolutional Neural Network method uses 4 1-dimensional convolution layers with ReLu activation. The data used is the value of Open, High, Low and Close prices on forex, indices and commodities which are combined into one with the close forex value target for the next 1 days. Testing of EUR / USD test data gets MSE results of 0.00009984. While the results of testing of the combined test data between EUR / USD, indices and commodities producing MSE vary between 0.0000589 to 0.000137 where the best combination is a combination of FTSE 100 and Natural Gas values. So, it can be concluded that other factors included in predicting have an influence on the results obtained. Copyright © 2020 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

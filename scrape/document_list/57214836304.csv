Voting is also often used in determining something that are very important, such as determining people's representative council. In addition, the current voting is still using the Conventional system that uses paper in balloting, and vote counting. This can cause human error. The technology that is increasingly developing in the current era of globalization is e-voting. From this research, an e-vote system will be developed that applies the concept of the block chain node with smart contract. Smart contracts generate unique code for each new election. So that manipulation of election results will not be possible because each voter has only one account and one address block chain. From the results of the test the author can conclude that the smart contract block chain can be used to prove the results of a safe choice and create e-voting that is honest. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The most important asset in a company is its employees. However, it is increasingly difficult for HR professionals to acquire and maintain the required talents. To solve this issue, organizations are starting to use gamification. Gamification is a design process where elements or mechanics in gaming are added to a non-game application or system. Compared to the standard recruitment, gamified recruitment has several advantages such as: 1) identify motivated candidates, 2) evaluate people without much experience more easily, 3) evaluate people who have diverse experience, and 4) engage the candidate. By using Marczewski’s gamification framework, we provide a theory-based guide on how to implement gamification in employee recruitment using a simple gamification framework. Though this proposed idea has not yet been tested, we believe that this idea is feasible in real life application. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Millennial are known to learn fast in using new things and get bored quickly. While insurance companies in Indonesia think about how insurance products are made and assume their products can make all people want to buy insurance, but in reality, almost all insurance products fail to get the millennial market. An obstacle that usually happens is where millennial is confused in choosing the means to spend money even though they have small income.

In running its business, Pegipegi has two platforms for the community to be able to access its services, namely through websites and mobile applications. Data shows that the majority of people access Pegipegi services through mobile applications. For the services offered, Pegipegi has a high rating. However, this cannot make Pegipegi the most visited OTA by the people of Indonesia. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the level of Pegipegi user loyalty is influenced by the user experience (UX) factor. UX measurements in this study were carried out using the user experience questionnaire (UEQ) method. Measurement data using the UEQ method will later be obtained using Microsoft Excel.

In order to improve the quality of logistics, business companies need to adopt e-logistics services to provide a more accurate, faster, and precise delivery. In this paper, a new model of smart contract is proposed, with the implementation to the e-logistics in the healthcare sector, by using the technology of IoT together with smart contract to enable users to get the information of their goods in real-time accurately. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

One of them is how a contract is made. Smart contract technology has offered a new, efficient, and secure way to automatically execute the terms of the agreement with no third-party to perform such contracts. The objective of this paper is to conduct a systematic overview of how the smart contract can bring opportunities and also challenges to Indonesia. We propose this paper due to the benefits Indonesian businesses will have by implementing smart contracts. Apart from the benefits, in Indonesia, there are still very few journals discussing smart contracts implementation. In this paper, there will be our findings of how smart contracts are utilized currently in industries, the challenges, and the current smart contract in Indonesia. The result will be used as guidance when considering, planning, and applicating smart contracts in Indonesia. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Major Indonesian companies experience difficulties to link the business objectives with IT implementation, that lead to creating major problems, such as: ineffective IT investment, major complaints amongst potential stakeholders, etc. The article takes the case study of one of the largest hospital chains, XYZ Hospital that has 21 subsidiaries operating in major cities in Indonesia. Currently, The XYZ hospital has cloud-based computer system that integrates entire business processes in Hospital Information System (HIS). Due to its all advance computer systems, ironically, the HIS receives many complaints and dissatisfaction amongst major stakeholders of the hospital. The director has risen the issue to evaluate the current HIS development. For this reason, the article proposes the popular Enterprise Architecture, Zachman framework to assess the current business process in the organisation. To simplify the discussion, the framework is simplified to the essential component of 3x3 matrix, and links them with 3 important stakeholder's perspectives of HIS development: planner (scope), owner (enterprise model) and designer (system model).

Cloud computing emerges to address the limitations of organizational resources in deploying IT services. Due to its advantages, there are still many debates about how to apply cloud computing effectively. Many organisations have reported that embracing the cloud computing is not an easy task and surrounded with many complexities. The use of cloud computing depends heavily on the ability of the organization to adapt with cloud computing paradigm. In order to maximize the benefits of cloud application, each organisation needs to develop a systematic, broad, holistic, and pragmatic approach. Cloud computing maturity model (CCMM) is initated to provide easy tool for assessing current conditions and improve service capabilities related to cloud computing. Measurements the implementation of cloud computing however, is challenging task since it needs to address certain factors in both business and technical perspectives. The article applies the popular framework initiated by the Open Data Center Alliances (ODCA) cloud computing maturity model (CCMM) as essential reference to guide applying cloud environment. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,,"Schroedl, H., Towards A Consumer Cloud Computing Maturity Model-Proposition of Development Guidelines, Maturity Domains and Maturity Levels; Hayes, B., Cloud computing (2008) Commun ACM, 51, pp. 9-11; Andrzejak, A., Kondo, D., Yi, S., Decision model for cloud computing under sla constraints (2010) Modeling, Analysis & Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS), 2010 IEEE International Symposium on, pp. 257-266; Etro, F., (2010) The Economics of Cloud Computing; Ponemon, L., (2010) Security of Cloud Computing Users, p. 12. , Islander, NY, USA: Ponemon Institute; Mattoon, S., Hensle, B., Baty, J., (2011) Cloud Computing Maturity Model Guiding Success with Cloud Capabilities, , California: USA Oracle Corp; Mell, P., Grance, T., (2011) The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing Others; Alhamad, M., Dillon, T., Chang, E., Conceptual SLA framework for cloud computing (2010) Digital Ecosystems and Technologies (DEST) 2010 4th IEEE International Conference on, pp. 606-610; Armbrust, M., Fox, A., Griffith, R., Joseph, A.D., Katz, R., Konwinski, A., A view of cloud computing (2010) Commun ACM, 53, pp. 50-58; Rajaraman, V., Cloud computing (2014) Resonance, 19, pp. 242-258; Ashari, A., Setiawan, H., Cloud computing: Solusi ICT?

The majority of mall in Jakarta have difficulty to develop plan that enables to optimize their parking slots. Some malls use valet system to gain more profit or ease the customers, unfortunately the valet system price is quite expensive for major customers and it sounds unpopular. Therefore, many area of valet parking space is not maximized. The similar problems also faced by traditional parking system where it creates problems for customers such as difficult to find parking space, paper ticket missing and unable to locate car location. The purpose in this study is to propose a Smart Parking System (SPS) through the use of Internet of Things (IoT). The article applies smart parking system that enables online booking system, paperless ticket, cashless payments and automated guided parking. The objective of the article is expected to enhance the current online parking management system with IoT design, with the aim to be used as reference for parking management in malls. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,,"Pardosi, T., (2016) STATISTIK TRANSPORTASI DKI Jakarta 2016, , Jakarta: BPS Provinsi DKI Jakarta; Wang, H., He, W., A reservation-based smart parking system (2011) Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)Conference on, pp. 690-695. , IEEE; Den Ardjuna, D., (2015) Internet of Thinks Methode and Implementation, p. 12. , rerasearch gate; Armstrong, E., (2015) Taking the U.

This involves planning, testing, tracking and reporting. Task management can help achieve individual goals, individual groups collaborate and share knowledge to achieve common goals. [1] Tasks are also distinguished by complexity, from low to high. Task management can form part of project management and process management for efficient workflows within an organization. Project managers who adhere to task-oriented management have a detailed and up-to-date project schedule, and a good team directs members and advances the project. [2] At present, the Task management system is growing along with the rapid advances in technology, so that anyone can access wherever he is. However, the majority of the current Task management system is not able to attract the attention and interest of its users. The concept of gamification will be applied to the ask management system so that work management is more organized, interesting and fun. This gamified system design will use the Marczewski's Gamification Framework. Framework that has user types with the needs of learning and self-development. Game mechanics in this user types such as levels, challenges, and rewards can support gamified system users in achieving goals.

Analytics include the ability to get different point of view from data by manipulating the data using statistics, mathematics, economics, simulations, optimizations, or other techniques that will enhance decision making of business organizations. BD is led by the widespread use of digital technologies in companies in various sectors, including Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company. The amount of data produced and communicated in is piled up everyday. Data in database include items sold, store inventory, and warehouse inventory of retail partner for specific stock keeping units (SKUs) produced by the manufacturer. These records called Point-of-Sale (POS) data. In modern days dynamic consumer markets, supply chains need to be value driven and consumer oriented. Demand planning allows supply chain members to focus on the consumer and create optimal value. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

But some of the big problems that are often faced by the restaurant business in implementing SI have become increasingly clear, among which are systems that are running less than optimal due to lack of experience. This paper will examine a restaurant franchise in Indonesia called SS Restaurant. Currently, SS Restaurant is facing complaints against the restaurant information system (RIS) such as the RIS system which is no longer adequate and does not have the latest features and the research and development (R&D) process of the restaurant is not running due to slow data processing and not optimal control outlets. The purpose of this paper is to design and recommend new business processes in restaurant RIS and add new system models such as online ordering, real-time reporting, cloud-based systems and data analysis for restaurants. The model in the Zachman framework that will be used in this research framework becomes a 3x3 matrix, basedon 3 main perspectives required by Restaurant SS management that is: General Scope, Owner Perspective and Designer Perspective. By implementing this new RIS, Restaurant SS is expected to be able to further increase their business’ performance through the benefits of improved operational efficiency and continual development of the implemented information system. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

This kind of business offers a low limited loan amount for customer needs. The online loan business only verifies the current data of each customer for the user profiling process. Due to insufficient profile data of customers in person, the limit cannot go higher than it is now. But this business has the potential to grow and provide a better-customized loan amount according to each customer's financial conditions. The lack of customer data profile can be solved by integrating the data and loan system with big data. Big data offers a way to give online loan business a more accurate profiling system to track the customer financial history and many more. By having sufficient data of potential customers, the online loan companies can provide higher loan amounts to the customers based on their financial track. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

To meet the needs of salary calculation, every working day all employees are required to attend work during work hours and after work hours using a fingerprint machine. With a fingerprint machine that is currently owned and the number of employees of more than 3000 people causes long queues during the attendance process. Not to mention if there are technical problems such as unreadable fingerprints or machine fingerprint errors, the attendance process will take longer. This can cause the start time to work backwards and not on time. Therefore we need a attendance system that can speed up the attendance process. The purpose of building a smartphone-based attendance system is so that employees can directly attend attendance via smartphones owned without having to attend through the fingerprint machine. The presence system will be built using android technology and intranet wifi networks. Intranet wifi networks are used to connect smartphones and servers. The intranet network was also chosen so that the attendance system coverage is limited to the PT XYZ factory environment, in order to avoid absent employees from outside the company. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Fraud in BPJS Kesehatan can be the source of loss if it not anticipated very well. Fraud can happen because of bad registration, no transparency in the data and minimum monitoring from third party outside the insurance components. This research consist of analysis and design of the fraud possibilities can be minimize and anticipated as much as possible. Blockchain is one of alternative method approach that can be applied for this matter because blockchain is good to analyze Big Data. Blockchain registered records by distributions, so that with the good records registration and distributed can minimize the possibility of the fraud.

This study using qualitative research on research methodology. The data collection technique is conducted by interviewing two people representing an organization and carried out to three organizations in Indonesia. The result of this study, Although the organization recognizes the greatness of big data especially for proper management control, it is constrained by the large costs of collecting and processing big data, which exceeds the core operating costs of their business, and they are not ready for big data processing because they are faced with special expertise needs in running big data that they don't already have. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

It is important in the business environment to work with the internet and where information sent and received has more types of threats and vulnerabilities. This paper wants to discuss two methods for assessing information system security risks in financial technology institutions. The methods to be discussed are the VECTOR Matrix method and the OCTAVE Allegro method. The VECTOR method is a security risk assessment method used to prioritize critical risks. While the method for carrying out a more detailed level of security risk analysis, it is recommended to use the OCTAVE Allegro approach. What IS security practices can learn is the reason for choosing the VECTOR Matrix and OCTAVE Allegro method. That these two methods are complementary during the information security risk assessment process in the business environment. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

This research will involve some numbers of respondent which are the health insurance participant. They will have to complete a survey for our data that make us possible to determine the factors affecting acceptance of the application. We made the survey questions based on TAM framework and one factor that we proposed. The questions consist of factors related to users’ view of service availability, usefulness, ease of use, attitude toward users using the application and users’ behaviour intention to use the application. A total of 88 respondents in this research indicate that the factors we have significantly impacted the users’ behavior to have intention to use the mobile app of health insurance.

The variables used are Perceived Ease of Used, Perceived of Usefulness and Behavioral Intention to Use of the main Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) variables that can be influenced by Trust, Review and Rating. This study aims to determine the impact of the Review and Rating by adding a new variable that is trust. Respondents in this study used the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method with 110 respondents collected from internet users who have made online bookings. Respondent data is reduced because some do not comply with the provisions of the study to 100 respondents. The results obtained from this study proved that trust variables influence and increase consumer confidence in conducting online booking queues. Both Rating and Review have an influence on Trust. The Review of Trust is more influential than the Rating of Trust, this is evidenced by the p-value Review of Trust (0,000) is lower than the p-value Rating of Trust (0,026). Therefore, online marketplace companies must make and improve reviews and ratings as one of the main marketing tools to increase consumer confidence and company revenue. © 2019 IEEE.","Behavioral Intention; Online Booking; Rating; Review; Trust","Electronic commerce; Information use; Behavioral intention; Internet users; Jakarta; Marketing tools; On-line marketplaces; P-values; Structural equation modeling; Technology acceptance model; Information systems",,,,,,,"APJII & Puskakom UI (2016) Profil Pengguna Internet Indonesia, , Jakarta: Puskakom UI&APJII; Davis, F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3), pp. 319-339; Fishbein, M., Ajzen, I., Belief, attitude, intention, and behaviour: An introduction to theory and research (1975) Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley; Venkatesh, V., Bala, H., Technology Acceptance Model 3 and a Research Agenda on Interventions (2008) Decision Sciences, 39 (2); Surendran, P., Technology acceptance model: A survey of literature (2012) International Journal of Business and Social Research (IJBSR), 2 (4), pp. 175-178; Chuttur, M.Y., Overview of the technology acceptance model: Origins (2009) Development and Future Directions, 9. , USA, Indians University.

With the latest communication technology called 5 Generation (5G), network speed is no longer an obstacle. But this can be done in countries that have adopted the 5G technology and there is still a lot of preparation needed by other countries to be able to maximize this 5G technology especially in the field of telemedicine.

Impact, many companies have become interested in online social marketing programs to invite consumers. However, even though the companies said they would need to be active on social media, they did not really understand how to do it, how to determine performance indicators, and how to measure them. As companies develop social media strategies, platforms like Instagram, Youtube, and Twitter connect elements that stand alone, not part of an integrated system. This article provides a systematic way to discuss and conceptualize online social media, as an ecosystem of related elements that use digital and traditional media. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The scheme of applying premium rates in Indonesia is uncorrelated when viewed from the basic principles of insurance in determining premium contributions. Groups of individuals with safe driving behavior are equated with groups of individuals who have more dangerous risk characteristics. The new schema can provide information about speed, speed acceleration, hard braking, etc. Where insurance companies can apply premium contributions from the assessment of driving behavior. The new schema is harness technology in the vehicle will recover in real time the vehicle data, including driving time, distance, and average speed, maximum speed of the driver, the amount of sharp turns, the location and the route of use of the vehicle which will be automatically stored in the database. Not only supported by technology but also the new schema vehicle in Indonesia acquired fairness in premium insurance price determination between good behavior driver and bad behavior driver. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Although the e-Government program has been carried out by the Jakarta Capital City Provincial Government since 2015 through Jakarta Smart City, by implementing Citizen Relationship Management (CiRM) through eight complaint channels, where citizens can participate in city development. But in the past three years the number of complaints has continued to decline. On the other hand, the use of social media in the field of governance is a major trend in egovernment practices throughout the world, in an effort to support public information disclosure, efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability of governance. The gamification effect is believed to be able to overcome this problem, many studies have shown that the gamification effect has a major influence in activating individual motivation. We are using the Octalysys Gamification Framework to analyze Gamification in implementing CiRM. We obtained data from observations of the current system, interviews with related parties, and questionnaires to citizens of Jakarta as users of the complaint channel. The results of the analysis show the lack of use of game design elements in the CiRM complaint channel, additional gamification techniques is needed to increase citizens engagement and participation. The conclusion of our study is that Gamification is very instrumental in supporting the implementation of CiRM. So that hopes to strengthening the relationship between the Government and Citizens can be achieved. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Citizen Relationship Management; Gamification; Octalysis Gamification Framework; Social Media",,,,,,,,"(2018) Statistik Potensi Kelurahan Provinsi DKI Jakarta 2018, , BPS DKI Jakarta; Gabrielli, S., Design challenges in motivating change for sustainable urban mobility (2014) Comput.

However, there is still little effort to address the adoption of CRM in the field of oil and gas government agencies, mainly related to the office facilities management area. This paper seeks to fill this gap by discussing the implications of CRM in the office facility management and its implementation in the upstream oil and gas agency in the Republic of Indonesia. The study recommends a CRM strategy implemented on each element of people, process, and technology.

Online travel agents (OTA) are one of the services that are gaining popularity in Indonesia lately which has changed the buying behavior of tourists, especially ‘open trip’ tour package. ‘Open trip’ provides trip that can be adjusted or customized for tourists according to the flexible budget, schedule and destination choices for private, joint, or group travelers to accommodate millennial travelers' preferences. This study used the extended Model of Internet Commerce Adoption (eMICA) in evaluating and analyzing the level of website development in Indonesian OTAs and propose a new e-commerce evaluation model to assess how effective online marketing strategies are. From the keyword ‘open trip Indonesia’ on Google search, 57 relevant open trip websites have been found. The findings from the eMICA model analysis shown that evaluations on the open trip website are not fully developed. The results showed that websites that reached Stage 3 and had a secure online payment system were only 28%. There are 3 key success factors to reach a fully functional website at Stage 3 of eMICA i.e. functionality, usability, and security. The higher the functionality of a website leads to the better usability and enhances the trusted perception of security among its users. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

With the problems faced by the company based on the data, it is used for stakeholders' decision making. The differentiator in this study uses Naive Bayes as a classification method in detail to the attributes that are tested and the customer is classified by the RFM method and in previous studies that have been conducted by other researchers are still little discussing the combining of these two methods between Naive Bayes and RFM. Naive Bayes is a method of classifying data with the results of 62% feasible and not feasible 38% then assisted by RFM method as a data analysis to each customer based on segmentation use 'usage rate' attribute on data so that with processed data can make a basic reference in making decisions. © 2019 IEEE.","Decision Making; E-commerce; Naïve Bayes; RFM Model","Classifiers; Electronic commerce; Sales; Classification methods; Customer loyalty; Differentiators; Making decision; Naive bayes; Rfm models; Usage rate; Decision making",,,,,,,"Chang Shia, B., Chen, M., Ramdansyah, A.D., Wang, S., Comparison of decision making in adopting e-commerce between Indonesia and Chinese Taipei (Case Study in Jakarta and Taipei City) (2015) American Journal of Industrial and Business Management, 5 (12), pp. 748-768; Santoso, G.J.A., Napitupulu, T.A., Factors affecting seller loyalty in business emarketplace: A case of Indonesia (2018) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 96 (1), pp. 162-171; Firmansyah, A., Overview of implementation constraints of ecommerce in Indonesia (2017) Jurnal Masyarakat Telematika Dan Informasi, 8 (2), pp. 127-136; Das, K., Gryseels, M., Sudhir, P., Tan, K.T., (2016) Unlocking Indonesia's Digital Opportunity, , Indonesia; Australian Trade and Investment Commission Austrade, ""Ecommerce in Indonesia: A guide for Australian business, "" Australia, 2018; Magatef, S.G., Tomalieh, E.F., The impact of customer loyalty programs on customer retention (2015) International Journal of Business and Social Science, 6 (8), pp. 78-93. , (1); Dick, A.S., Basu, K., Customer loyalty: Toward an integrated conceptual framework (1994) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 22 (2), pp. 99-113. , Mar; Larose, D.T., Larose, C.D., (2015) Data Mining and Predictive Analytics, , 2nd ed.

Therefore, the use of knowledge should be managed and developed properly to produce maximum benefits, and to support the organisation's objectives. Although knowledge is considered important, many organisations in Indonesia still face many difficulties to measure and implement effective knowledge management (KM). Many corporations have reported major failures in adopting KM system. There is very few reference can be found especially for Indonesian corporations, to apply an effective KM that provides maximum benefits. The article examines the application of knowledge management system (KMS) in XYZ Co., a large IT service company, that serves major large corporations in Indonesia with the purpose to provide a reference of KMS application. The article adopts the successful KMS implementation based on the maturity level that was developed by Uday Kulkarni, Robert St. Louis, and Intel Corp. KMS maturity level has advantages in providing systematic thinking that commonly ignored by the Indonesian corporations. The KMS maturity model has been widely applied in major corporations and produced significant results. The article combines both KMS maturity model and 10-step KM roadmap developed by Armit Tiwana to maximize the output of KMS. The outcome of article is expected to be used as a reference for large corporation in Indonesia to apply KMS. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS","KM Maturity Model; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Management Maturity Level; Knowledge Management System",,,,,,,,"Tiwana, A., Williams, M., (2000) The Essential Guide to Knowledge Management:: E-Business and Crm Applications, , Prentice Hall PTR; Chigada, J., The role of knowledge management in enhancing organisational performance in selected banks of South Africa (2014) Information Science, , University of South Africa, Pretoria; Alavi, M., Leidner, D.E., Knowledge management and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Q, pp. 107-136; Foote, A., Halawi, L.A., Knowledge management models within information technology projects (2018) J.

Continuous transaction is a state where users make transactions repeatedly and continuously. Using four independent constructs which have relation to trust and satisfaction. By using a simple random sampling technique and evaluate the analysis using structural equation model, has discovers that continuous transactions are influenced by the satisfaction of users of M-banking application. The ease of use and usefulness felt by users also have an impact on the level of satisfaction. The results of this study indicate that to improve user satisfaction it is necessary to make improvements in other aspects, such as convenience on using M-banking application, benefits obtained, level of application security, and maintain user privacy. It is hoped that this research can provide a new perspective on the continuous transactions of M-banking application users. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

However, a smartwatch as an extension of a smartphone experienced a different thing. This study aims to investigate the relationship between usability, brands, and prices towards the perspective of consumers in Indonesia on smartwatches. We surveyed 116 smartwatch users and interviewed ten of them to get a complete understanding of their perceptions. This study reveals that the usage of smartwatches is less significant in influencing consumer perceptions, while brands and prices are strongly influencing the perception of consumers who have used smartwatches. Besides, this study also revealed that most respondents chose the smartwatch brand based on its smartphone brand. Xiaomi smartwatches were more affordable than other brands.

The study was conducted on high class store by taking the object of material gymnastic product (spandex). Simulation confidently demonstrates that the Fuzzy-AHP approach is able to be operated to generate parameter Quality Product as the best sub-criteria (with value 0.221), the Fuzzy-TOPSIS technique can be used to ring out the supplier (where CV. Maju Jaya Abadi as the best supplier), and the method Fuzzy-MOLP is exploited to calculate the allocation of quota (where CV. Maju Jaya Abadi as a supplier with the highest percentage of 44.40%). © 2018 IEEE.","decision support application; fuzzy AHP; fuzzy logic; fuzzy MOLP; fuzzy TOPSIS; supplier selection","Computer circuits; Decision support systems; Economics; Hierarchical systems; Information management; Decision support applications; Fuzzy AHP; fuzzy MOLP; FUZZY TOPSIS; Supplier selection; Fuzzy logic",,,,,,,"Yazdani, M., Chatterjee, P., Zavadskas, E.K., Zolfani, S.H., Integrated QFD-MCDM framework for green supplier selection (2017) Journal of Cleaner Production, 142 (4), pp. 3728-3740; Manello, A., Calebrese, G., The influence of reputation on supplier selection: An empirical study of the European automotive industry (2018) Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, , In press; Lo, H.-W., Liou, J.J.H., Wang, H.-S., Tsai, Y.-S., An integrated model for solving problems in green supplier selection and order allocation (2018) Journal of Cleaner Production, 90, pp. 339-352; Sarkar, S., Pratihar, D.K., Sarkar, B., An integrated fuzzy multiple criteria supplier selection approach and its application in a welding company (2018) Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 46, pp. 163-178; Hamdan, S., Cheaitou, A., Dynamic green supplier selection and order allocation with quantity discounts and varying supplier availability (2017) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 110, pp. 573-589; Sun, C.-C., A performance evaluation model by integrating fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS methods (2010) Expert Systems with Applications, 37, pp. 7745-7754; Shaw, K., Shankar, R., Yadav, S.S., Thakur, L.S., Supplier selection using fuzzy AHP and fuzzy multi-objective linear programming for developing low carbon supply chain (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39 (9), pp. 8182-8192; Zadeh, L.A., Fuzzy logic = computing with words (1996) IEEE Transaction of Fuzzy Systems, 4 (2), pp. 103-111; Liou, J.J.H., Yen, L., Tzeng, G.-H., Building an effective safety management system for airlines (2008) Journal of Air Transport Management, 14 (1), pp. 20-26; Wu, W.-W., Lee, Y.-T., Developing global managers competencies using the fuzzy DEMATEL method (2007) Expert Systems with Applications, 32 (2), pp. 499-507; Utama, D.N., Nuryasin, F., Rustamaji Nurbojatmiko, E., Qoyim, I., D&T: An Euclidean distance optimization based intelligent donation system model for solving the communitys problem (2016) Journal of Physics: Conf.

Blended learning refers to combining traditional classroom learning with e-learning with the aims to enrich entire learning process. From the last decade, we have seen the strong growth of millenials students in Indonesian higher education institutions. They developed high familiarity with Internet technology, social media and smartphone uses. The needs of adopting social media into blended learning has become essential part in blended learning mode nowadays. For this reason, the article takes a popular method, Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) enables to enrich the entire e-learning environment. We apply the VLE dashboard with adopting the Web-based Synchronized Multimedia Lecture (WSML) framework that enables to provide authoring tool to record the temporal and spatial relationships among media involved and facilitate synchronize presentation across media access. This framework has advantages to promote the real-time collaboration amongst students and teacher(s), like in a classroom setting, but with online mode. VLE takes advantages of web 2.0 and social media technology that enables to conduct real time meeting with video conference and easy exchange multimedia files. The outcome of the article is expected to provide social media learning based system that can be apply in higher education institutions to avoid boredom in traditional blended learning. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Computer aided instruction; Electronic document exchange; Multimedia services; Social networking (online); Students; Teaching; Classroom settings; E-learning environment; Effective learning; Higher education institutions; Internet technology; Real-time collaboration; Temporal and spatial; Virtual learning environments; E-learning",,,,,,,"Bhutawale, S., Sakharkar, P., What Is E-Learning?; Riahi, G., E-learning systems based on cloud computing: A review (2015) Procedia Comput Sci., 62, pp. 352-359. , Scse; Gikas, J., Grant, M.M., Mobile computing devices in higher education: Student perspectives on learning with cellphones, smartphones & social media (2013) Internet High Educ., 19, pp. 18-26; Hassanzadeh, A., Kanaani, F., Elahi, S., A model for measuring e-learning systems success in universities (2012) Expert Syst Appl., 39 (12), pp. 10959-10966; Mason, R., Rennie, F., E-Learning and Social Networking Handbook (2008) British Journal of Educational Technology, 40, p. 189; Gibson, L.A., Sodeman, W.A., Millennials and technology: Addressing the communication gap in education and practice (2014) Organ Dev J., 32, pp. 63-75; Lister, M., Trends in the Design of E-Learning and Online Learning (2014) J Online Learn Teach., 10, pp. 671-680; Al-Adwan, A., Al-Adwan, A., Smedley, J., Exploring students acceptance of e-learning using Technology Acceptance Model in Jordanian universities (2013) Int J Educ Dev Using Inf Commun Technol., 9, pp. 4-18; Zakarian, S., (2013) Abstract Education and Social Media: An Examination of Facebook, Twitter and Youtube in K-12 Education, , May 2013; Scholar, M.D., Thoene, W.S., (2012) The Impact of Social Networking Sites on College Students' Consumption Patterns; Panekham, A., (2014) Exploring the Role Social Media Plays in the Student Learning Experience of 2014 University Life in NZ, p. 79. , November; Scott, K.M., Does a university teacher need to change e-learning beliefs and practices when using a social networking site?

Organization that has lack of IT governance also experiences lack of good corporate governance. As a result, the organization has difficulties to link its IT benefits to organization's objectives. In some cases, the lack of IT governance even causes severe impacts to school management. The article takes case of a higher institution, STMIK MBM, one of popular IT school in North Sulawesi, that has experienced with frequent IT interruption. The frequent IT interruption has caused severe consequences not only to current school operation, but also to the reputation of the school. In the beginning year of 2017, the ineffective academic data management has caused the severe interruption of school operation and led to the change of school management. To promote IT good governance, the new school director has initiative to apply COBIT 5, as an effective IT governance framework for the school.

Indonesian enterprises have experience with a huge amount of investments and ended up with minor benefits. Despite its unprecedented benefits, the SAP strategy is still considered as a mandatory enterprise system for every enterprise to compete in the marketplaces. The article examines the SAP implementation from cultural perspectives to present new horizon that commonly ignored by major Indonesian enterprises. The article applies the multiple case studies with three large Indonesia enterprises, such as KS, the largest steel producer; GEM, a subsidiary of conglomerate enterprise operates in the mining industry, and HS, a subsidiary of the largest retailer in Asia with more than 700 stores in Indonesia.

The implementing ERP-SAP in Indonesian enterprises are still facing tremendous challenges with the failure rate can reach more than 80% of the cases. The article examines the common problems faced by the consultants whenever they deal with their clients, from the practical perspectives. The article takes the multiple case studies of the leading enterprises in Indonesia, such as: KS (largest steel producer), GEM (large mining producer), and HS (large retailer), with the aim to identify the root of problems of SAP implementation. The outcome of the study is expected to provide the consultants with the guideline to understand the ERP implementation process in their clients and effective solutions to cope with it. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Failure analysis; Steelmaking; Effective solution; Enterprise resource planning (ERP); ERP implementation; Failure rate; Indonesia; Multiple-case study; Steel producers; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,,,"Seo, G., (2013) Challenges in Implementing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System in Large Organizations: Similarities and Differences between Corporate and University, , (May); Motwani, J., Subramanian, R., Gopalakrishna, P., Critical factors for successful ERP implementation: Exploratory findings from four case studies (2005) Comput Ind., 56 (6), pp. 529-544; Dantes, G.R., Hasibuan, Z.A., Comparison of ERP Implementation Process of Two Organizations: An Exploratory Research (2011) Int Conf Soc Sci Humanit [Internet], 5, pp. 295-299; Wong, B., University of TS, Tein D Prisocroncipal ESM.

Since its introduction in year 1990, AC has gained wide popularity for its application in the business world; nevertheless, its application still rare to be found in the vocational schools (known as polytechnics) in Indonesia. In general, the Indonesian polytechnics have lack of AC mechanism in improving their collaboration model with the firms. The article examines the important role of knowledge management (KM) model to improve the AC mechanism inside the state-owned polytechnics. The state-owned polytechnics have mission to support local and national economic corridors, and strengthening the foundation of firms.

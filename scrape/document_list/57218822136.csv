As for the method is used for this research is using six sigma approach with DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) phases to analyze types of waste of staple fiber production and factors that causes the waste. Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) Method to analyze the effect of machine productivity and performance on waste of staple fiber production using calculation of Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and six big losses are using to analyze the losses that caused value of OEE. Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) is used to analyze the risks that probably occurs during spinning process on production line 28P which causes the high total time losses on idling and minor stoppages. One of the risk that has the highest probability is the amount of output caused by abnormality of gear pump machine. Based on the calculation of Time to Failure (TTF) and Time to Repair (TTR), the interval of gear pump machine replacement using age replacement model is 1300 hours and the interval of gear pump machine maintenance is 823,9277 hours as of the reliability of machine has increase after. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt.

Cashless Transaction exists because of fast majorities of human transaction evolved towards digital environment, this creates an opportunity where legal money exists, recorded, and exchanged in digital form. Thus cashless transaction will make less effort in currency operation cost, keep on track with expenses, connected anytime everywhere as long as connected with internet, and eliminates the needs of banknotes or receipt. Cashless Transaction have done over the past few years making life easier by reducing a number of objects to merge into 1 functional object that could make payments faster and simpler starting with check the first mark of cashless transaction that's still being used nowadays, but cashless transaction doesn't stop evolving in this modern era where money is demonetized, cashless transaction is moving into the digital grid resulting a breakthrough mobile wallets and online transfer that offers people flexibility because its technology advancement makes it possible to make payments anytime and anywhere since it's only depend on a secure network(internet) and a platform, therefore cashless transaction could be done as fast as possible saving precious time. Cashless transaction has some of key components such as security, UX, Functionality, Performance and Data Integrity. Five key components could make cashless transaction become reality but also poses a different threat to cashless transaction. Hacking is one of them. Hacking could be done by anyone that have the ability to compromise the transmission, the transmission needs to have more data protection thus the cashless transaction could be done safely and free of risk. © 2020 ACM.","Breakthrough; Cashless transaction; Compromise; Connected; Digital environment; Digital grid; Evolved; Expenses; Hacking; Key components; Merge; Operation cost; Reality","Personal computing; Security of data; Data integrity; Digital environment; Digital information; Electronic representations; Financial transactions; Functional object; Secure networks; Technology advancement; Electronic document exchange",,,,,"https://shodhgangotri.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/123456789/4546/1/synopsis.pdf; https://www.quora.com/What-is-cashless-Transaction; https://www.quora.com/What-Are-The-Advantages-of-cashless-Transaction; https://www.quora.com/What-is-The-meaning-of-A-cashless-Transaction; https://dzone.com/articles/5-key-elements-of-digital-payment-systems; https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316429963_Cashless_transaction_Modes_advantages_and_disadvantages; https://www.charteredclub.com/cashless-payment/; Definition of Hacking | What is Hacking ?

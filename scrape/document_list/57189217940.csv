Three provinces are chosen as samples: Bali, Yogyakarta, and DKI Jakarta. The employee performance assessment was conducted using criteria and weight calculation regarding teacher's content knowledge, educational background, grade, rank, age, and participation in teacher trainings. The analysis method used to assess teacher performance in this study was Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with Expert Choice software. The result of this analysis was used to design the DSS-Based Teacher Management Model. © 2016 IEEE.","analytical hierarchy Process (AHP); decision support system; performance; Teacher","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Education; Hierarchical systems; Information management; Personnel rating; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Content knowledge; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Elementary schools; Employee performance; performance; Teacher; Weight calculation; Teaching",,,,,"Saaty, T.L., Decision-making with the AHP: Why is the principal eigenvector necessary (2003) European Journal of Operational Research, pp. 85-91. , Elsevier Science B.V; Alonso, A.J., Teresa, L.M., Consistency in the analytical hierarchy (2006) International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems, 14 (4), pp. 445-459. , World Scientific Publishing Company; Bernasconi, M., Choirat, R., Seri, C., (2003) The Analytic Hierarchy Process and the Theory of Measurement; Triantaphyllou, E., Mann, S.H., Using the analytical hierarchy process for decision making in engineering application: Some challenges (1995) Inter'l Journal of Industrial Engineering: Applications and Practice, 2 (1), pp. 35-44; Saaty, T.L., Decision making with the analytical hierarchy process (2008) Int.

The emergence of these diseases affected by various factors such as multiple human, biological, climate, and ecological determinants. Within the last decade, the world has witnessed the global outbreak of infectious diseases. This situation highlights the need for an early warning disease detection system that would be able to detect, identify, and contain pathogens with epidemic potential. This article presents how Early Warning System (EWS) could be a proactive system that would be able to predict infectious disease outbreaks and detect the sudden increase of any livestock disease with the potentials to become epidemic before spreading. © 2015 IEEE.","Early warning system; Epidemic; Infectious disease outbreak; Infectious diseases; Livestock disease; Pathogen","Agriculture; Epidemiology; Pathogens; Telecommunication services; Early Warning System; Epidemic; Infectious disease; Infectious disease outbreaks; Livestock disease; Diseases",,,,,"Caves, L.F., Pascual M, M., Comparing models for early warning systems of neglected tropical diseases PLoS Negl Trop Dis, 1 (1), p. e33. , Retrieved on June 8, 2015; Kopec, E.G., Kawano, M., Klaver, R.W., Blumenthal, B., Ceccato, P., Connor, S.J., An online operational rainfall-monitoring resource for epidemic malaria early warning systems in Africa (2005) Malaria Journal, 4, p. 6. , Retrieved on June 15, 2015; Chan, E.H., Global capacity for emerging infectious disease detection (2010) Proceding of the National Academy of Science of United State of America, 107 (50). , 2010; Halide, H., Rais, P.R., Early warning system for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) epidemics in makassar (2011) Jurnal Matematika & Sains, 16 (1), pp. 26-34; Quansah, J.E., Engel, B., Rochon, G.L., Early warning systems: A review (2010) Journal of Terrestrial Observation, 2 (2), pp. 24-44; Racel, L., Bailey, T.C., Stephenson, D.B., Graham, R.J., Coelho, C.A.S., Carvalho, M.S., Barcellos, C., Spatio-temporal modelling of climate-sensitive disease risk: Towards an early warning system for dengue in Brazil (2011) Computers & Geosciences Journal, 37 (3), pp. 371-381. , issue; Juffrie, M., Focks, D.A., Early warning system (EWS) for dengue in Indonesia and Thailand (2009) Jurnal Berkala Ilmu Kedokteran, 41 (3), pp. 134-142; Racloz, V., Ramsey, R., Tong, S., Hu, W., Surveillance of dengue fever virus: A review of epidemiological models and early warning systems PLoS Negl Trop Dis, 6 (5), p. e1648. , Retrieved on June 15, 2015; Veenema, T.G., Toke, J., Early detection and surveillance for biopreparedness and emerging infectious diseases (2015) Nursing Online Journal, 11 (1). , Man 02.

Impact, many companies have become interested in online social marketing programs to invite consumers. However, even though the companies said they would need to be active on social media, they did not really understand how to do it, how to determine performance indicators, and how to measure them. As companies develop social media strategies, platforms like Instagram, Youtube, and Twitter connect elements that stand alone, not part of an integrated system. This article provides a systematic way to discuss and conceptualize online social media, as an ecosystem of related elements that use digital and traditional media. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The digital transformation is required by incumbent to develop innovation on product and service business model based on customer experience orientation. To support this transformation, strong digital leader is important to assure the development of this transformation. The study on the role of digital leadership on business model innovation and customer experience has not been explored, significantly, Hence, this research aims at assessing the role of digital leadership, whether it directly or indirectly influences the customer experience orientation in developing business model innovation. This study was conducted through survey to 88 senior leader respondents from Indonesia telecommunication firms, in which Smart-PLS application was used to analyze the data. The result show that digital leadership had direct and indirect impacts on customer experience orientation in developing business model innovation. The practical implications of these findings are recommended for the senior leader of management of telecommunications industries in Indonesia to strengthen digital leadership capability in conjunction with the development of business model innovation and customer experience orientation. Further research can be explored by expanding the sample, industry, statistical application and longitudinal study. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

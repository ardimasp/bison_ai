The paper will improve the existing organic food product distribution business model and the proposed business model with the implementation of knowledge management to accommodate the value co-creation among stakeholders. The reason why value co-creation among stakeholders needs to be improved is because currently organic food producers focus only on selling their products without having proper knowledge about their customers, while customers do not have enough awareness about organic food’s benefit. Because of this gap, this research tries to find the solution by improving the organic product distribution system through the application of value co-creation process. This paper will use qualitative research method as the main method to collect data and scientific analysis for achieving the goals which will be proposed and related to the research objectives as explained before. © BEIESP.","Knowledge management; Organic food distribution; Value Co-creation",,,,,,,"Aryanto, R., Apriliyanti, S., Simamora, B.H., So, I.G., Advertising personality impact to education institution brand image base on three hits theory of exposure (2013) Advanced Science Letters; Chesbrough, H., Spohrer, J., A research manifesto for services science (2006) Communications of the ACM, p. 2006. , January; Creswell, J.W., (2003) Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Method Approaches, , 2nd edition, Thousand Oaks, California: Sage Publication; Garnida, N., Tjakraatmadja, J.H., Nasution, R.A., Purwanegara, M.S., Restructuring Knowledge of Organic Customer Profile within KM-CRM Framework (2013) The International Food Research Sournal, , (ISSN 1985-4668)-2013-627; Gerbert, H., Geib, M., Kolbe, L., Brenner, W., Knowledge enabled customer relationship management: Integrating customer relationship management and management concepts (2003) Journal of Knowledge Management, 7 (5), pp. 107-1243; Lambe, P., (2001) Knowledge Based CRM: A Map Green Chameleon, , http://www.straitsknowledge.com/; Laroche, M., Bergeron, J., Barbaro-Forleo, G., Targeting consumers who are willing to pay more for environmentally friendly products (2001) Journals of Consumer Marketing, 18 (6), pp. 503-520; Rowley, J., Paterning paradigm?

However, there are many drawbacks related to health issues, especially for younger people. Some have degenerative diseases that in the past only presented in older people. This paper aims to identify the driving factors that influence the decisions of young consumers to purchase organic food. This research is conducted using mixed methods. Based on the exploratory method, it is found that there are 16 factors drive buying decision towards organic food. Furthermore, through a quantitative method, two clusters of customers are identified. Cluster 1 is consumers who are aware based on life demands that have seven main driving factors, while cluster 2 includes consumers who follow the modern lifestyle based on the suggestions. This study can provide insight into value driven by customers’ buying decisions.

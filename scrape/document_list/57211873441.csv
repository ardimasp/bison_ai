Sarcasm or verbal irony is a linguistic phenomenon where the wording of a speaker signifies the opposite of the literal meaning of what they are saying. On social media, Indonesians tend to use sarcastic remarks to criticize something and this behavior can pose a problem when a sentiment analysis is performed where the analysis yields false-positive results. To solve this potential problem, the detection of sarcasm is necessary. A convolutional neural network model is used in this paper to handle the automated identification of sarcasm in Indonesian. Although it is mainly used in computer vision, this model has shown promising results on specific kinds of sentiment analysis and classification problems compared to other neural network models. Using this model can increase detection accuracy compared to discrete models. There have been many studies conducted on sarcasm detection, although the majority is in English. Other languages such as Indonesian are slow in improvement compared to English. This fact can be seen by the lack of publications on Indonesian sarcasm detection studies. This study is conducted to contribute to other Indonesian sarcasm detection studies. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Generating a report for stakeholders quickly and accurately is highly required in assisting them making a data-driven decision. By developing a data warehouse, it is possible for a company to do a data-driven decision making to appeal to their customer segments. This paper proposes a data warehouse model design to analyse the sales data contained in the database. The method that was implemented for this particular data warehouse development is the nine-step methodology designed by Kimball.

To appeal to their current and potential customers, a company must understand the market interests. Companies can segment their customers by using surveys and telemetry data to get to know the customer’s interests. One way of segmenting the customer is by grouping or clustering them according to their interests and behaviors. In this study, the k-prototypes clustering algorithm, which is an improved combination of k-means and k-modes algorithm, will be used to cluster a behavioral data that contains both numerical and categorical attribute, obtained from a survey conducted on teenagers into clusters of 4, 5, and 6. Each cluster will contain teenagers with certain behavior different from other clusters. And then by analyzing the results, advertisers will be able to define a profile that indicates their interests regarding the internet, social media and text messaging, effectively revealing the kind of ad that would be relatable for them. © BEIESP.","Behavioral data; Cluster Analysis; Interest; K-Prototypes",,,,,,"Lenhart, A., Mobile access shifts social media use and other online activities (2015) Teens, Social Media & Technology Overview, , http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/09/mobile-access-shifts-social-media-use-and-other-online-activities/; Wright, E., Khanfar, N.M., Harrington, C., Kizer, L.E., The Lasting Effects Of Social Media Trends On Advertising (2016) J.

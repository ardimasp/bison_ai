This case study of university students in Jakarta involved 235 students (128 male, 97 female). Results of this qualitative study showed 96% preference for mobile-based learning. A further 94% showed the needs for collaboration and authenticity for 92%. Hofstede's cultural dimensions were used to identify the gender aspects of MALL. Preference for Masculinity (65%) was showed rather than Femininity (35%), even among the female respondents (70% of the population). Professions and professionalism received strongest preference (70%) while Individuality and Collectivism had equal preferences among students. Both female and male respondents requested Indulgence (84%) for mobile-based learning with more male respondents opted for Indulgence. The study provided a model for this gender sensitive mobile-based learning. Implications of implementing mobile-based learning as an ideal alternative for well-accommodated education are is also discussed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"E-learning; Students; Hofstede's cultural dimensions; Jakarta; Qualitative study; University students; Education computing",,,,,"Blake, R.J., (2011) Ann.

The object of the research is computer-mediated communication of fandom in YouTube video commentaries. The data is analyzed by using Cyberpragmatics approach. The two main objectives of the study are; (1) to observe the process of identity construction through self-presentation and interpersonal relationship within the fandom and (2) to define the characteristics of fandom in YouTube commentaries as online Social Network site. The finding shows that the identity constructions are done by the use of specific nickname and avatar related to the idols. There are two most salient characteristics of online community within the fandom; the active participations and evidence of shared history, culture, norms, and values. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Computer-mediated communication; Cyberpragamtics; Fandom; Social network","History; Online systems; Websites; Computer mediated communication; Cyberpragamtics; Fandom; Interpersonal relationship; On-line communities; On-line social networks; Self presentations; Video commentary; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Yus, F., (2011) Cyberpragmatics: Internet-Mediated Communication in Context, , 2011.

The long history of Dutch colonialism in the past and the popularity of English in the present day in Indonesia have caused the country to be an interesting object for the study of English teaching in post-colonialism discourse. The observation was done by distributing the questionnaires to the students to investigate their perception toward English language and how they create the dichotomy of non-native English teachers and native English teachers. The result of the observation shows that English language is seen as superior language by Indonesian students and native English teachers are more preferred and perceived as the only legitimate teacher to teach English in Indonesian school. Thus, it proves that colonial language ideology exists within the process of English Language Teaching in Indonesia. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","English language teaching; Language ideology; Native english teacher; Post-colonialism",,,,,,"Shin, H., Kubota, R., Post-colonialism and globalization in language education (2008) The Handbook of Educational Linguistics, pp. 206-219. , edited by B.

The process of commodification is examined through the roles of English Mixing based on textual position within the advertisements and its interconnection to the new global economy. The finding shows that English mixing is used by local companies to create globally oriented advertisements but locally targeted audience. The global orientation reveals through the use of English as signature line and product naming and the local targeted audience revealed through the use of English only as attention getter; based on minimum uses of English mixing in body copy message and maximum uses in headline. It suggests that the source of the commodification process of English in Indonesian advertisements is related to its function as global language in the globalized economy. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Advertisements; Commodification of language; English mixing; Globalization",,,,,,"Fairclough, N., (2000) Multiliteracies and Language: Orders of Discourse and Intertextuality, Multiliteracies: Literacy, Learning and the Design of Social Futures, pp. 162-181. , edited by B.

The range of age of the participants of the research is from twenty to thirty years old. The method applied in this is descriptive qualitative research. The source of the data for the research is the observational data from 5 participants who are basic Japanese learners. The data are in the form of pre-test, post-test, and respond from the participants. The descriptive analysis will be done to describe the result of the pre-test, post-test, and respond from the participant. The result of the analysis indicates that online learning medium can be effectively done for grammar and conversation learning. The advantage of the online media learning webinar, such as Skype and Zoom, is its capability to make the participants are able to interact written and orally and to share presentation screen through sharing display feature. Since one of the most crucial factors of online learning is internet, Zoom is more recommended compare to Skype. The observation shows that Skype is often disconnected in the middle of learning process. © 2017 The Authors.

This method includes three main concepts, the concepts of fuzzy, time series and Markov chain. Fuzzy concepts are useful to classify variables, time series concept to observe the JCI movement during a particular period and Markov chain concept is used in process prediction of JCI values using the transition probability matrix. To assist the analysis of predictions, we design a web-based application that aims to predict by analyzing a JCI data set closing price on a certain period, so that the process can be more efficient, thorough and practical. We compare the accuracy of FTMC and prediction powered from Song and Chissom. The resulting value is quite accurate and can assist users in making decisions relating to the exercise of economic activity. © 2015 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.","Fuzzy time series model; JCI; Markov chain; Web",,,,,,"Arumugam, P., Anithakumari, V., Fuzzy time series method for forecasting Taiwan export data (2013) Inter.

Traditional attendance by using handwritten signatures has proven to be very inefficient due to its challenging instances of time-consuming, falsifications, impersonations and miscalculations. In addition to the traditional way, among other approaches used for recording attendance, biometric technique is the one attendance method. Using biometric attendance, such as fingerprint, voice, and face will be simplify the process of attendance, and employee does not need to sign on attendance sheets every day. This technique is more efficient and saves times than traditional way. This paper proposed a face recognition as biometric attendance system using deep learning method. The entire process of developing a face recognition model will be described in detail. This face recognition model is composed of several essential steps using the most advanced technique: Multitask Convolutional Neural Network (MTCNN) for face detection and FaceNet for embeddings – verification process to recognize face. This goal must be met as a result of the attendance system, and every condition must be concerned to return the valid and accurate result. This model will gather the face image of the employee and will return 128-d embedded vectors. Thus, result of the attendance process will be stored to excel sheet and the system will automatically mark the attendance once employee is detected by camera. After implementing the model, overall accuracy was 95% on a small dataset of the original face images of employees in the real-time environment.

These problems are found in the business process of PT XYZ which has a line stop annual recapitulation caused by IT factors for 451 minutes, with the biggest cause at the level of availability of the production process information system server. In maintaining the continuity of its business processes, PT XYZ requires a risk control measure for the main problem, namely improving the quality of the availability of the production process information system server, by building an on-premise replication method suitable for various disaster threats. This study aims to find out the specific steps in determining what replication methods are appropriate to be implemented in a manufacturing environment with the conditions of business needs such as PT XYZ, whose investment feasibility is then evaluated through a systematic approach in the form of a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) method. From the overall results of the analysis process of PT XYZ's business needs, and by utilizing a combination of existing technologies, the appropriate replication method is obtained for the manufacturing environment, then integrating the needs of the Disaster Recovery Center (DRC) system with the infrastructure it has today can produce DRC designs that are more efficient and effective from a technical and cost perspective. © 2020 Little Lion Scientific.

Initially, LPG gas does not smell, but if so it will be difficult to detect if there is a leak in the gas cylinder. The very first action is the human sense of smell so that humans can smell the gas. Then, errors also often occur on the manometer used by the regulator is still analog, so the reading of the gas pressure data is still less accurate. The purpose of this paper is to propose an LPG gas leak detection device using MQ2 sensor and LPG gas pressure measurement using MPX5700 sensor, buzzer as an alarm, led, LCD as a gas pressure information media, and serve as a tool to open the regulator valve when a leak occurs. The average results of each measurement with a good distance and time are used is to refer to the limits of excess levels ie more than 100ppm are found in an average condition of 10 seconds with a distance of 10cm, 15cm, 20cm, and 25cm. The Mean Square Error (MSE) value of the MPX5700DP sensor with the gas regulator being compared is 0.09 for the absence of gas conditions received and 0.61 for the gas conditions that have been received by the sensor, this test is to obtain a more accurate value. © 2020 Little Lion Scientific.

The research in this field still open because each language will have different sign language. In the other hand the image that was captured by the mobile devices depend on the environment such as brightness and the background. The sign language captured with static background has high accuracy compared with dynamic background that has colorful background. Most of research do not include the dynamic background.

Ensuring that correct implementation of business process in each service in SOA environment is quite different than monolithic applications, where each service must be tested independently and jointly, depending on targeted testing scope. With numerous proposed approaches for solving such challenge, this paper reviews some of those approaches to ease readers understanding of what can be done in testing in SOA environment. More specifically, this paper provides review on generic proposed approaches, unit testing, and integration testing approaches as part of quality assurance testing on SOA environment. In summary, the details of testing implementation will differ for each enterprise/organization as each has different set of requirements to satisfy. © 2020 IEEE.","Quality Assurance; Review; Service-oriented architecture; Testing","Application programs; Information management; Information services; Integration testing; Quality assurance; Software design; Business Process; Quality assurance testing; Unit testing; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,,"Candea, G., Bucur, S., Zamfir, C., Automated software testing as a service (2010) Proceedings of the 1st ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing, pp. 155-160; Clegg, B.S., Rojas, J.M., Fraser, G., Teaching software testing concepts using a mutation testing game (2017) Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering and Education Track, pp. 33-36; Suma, V., Gopalakrishnan Nair, T., Better defect detection and prevention through improved inspection and testing approach in small and medium scale software industry (2010) International Journal of Productivity and Quality Management; Morris, E., Anderson, W., Bala, S., Carney, D., Morley, J., Place, P., Simanta, S., Testing in service-oriented environments (2010) Carnegie Mellon University; Kumar, A., Singh, M., An empirical study on testing of soa based services (2015) I.

The research uses simplified structural models to explore the sensitivity of the index to damages, to compare the index performance with a traditional but popular damage detection method, and to understand the local/global predictive capability of the index. The research uses two simple models, namely, single- and two-degree-of-freedom systems. The results suggest that the damage index is local, that can only monitor damages occurring near the points of measurements, but it is sensitive to damages, unlike the natural frequency, which is global but less sensitive. © 2020 Author(s).","Damage Index; General Vibration Method; Mode Shape; Natural Frequency; Structural Health Monitoring",,,,,,,"Xu, Y., Brownjohn, J.M., Hester, D., Enhanced sparse component analysis for operational modal identification of real-life bridge structures (2019) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 116, pp. 585-605; Perez, M.A., Serra-Lopez, R., A frequency domain-based correlation approach for structural assessment and damage identification (2019) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 119, pp. 432-456. , 2019; Chang, C.M., Lin, T.K., Chang, C.W., Applications of neural network models for structural health monitoring based on derived modal properties (2018) Measurement, 129, pp. 457-470; Gunawan, F.E., Improving the reliability of F-statistic method by using linear support vector machine for structural health monitoring (2018) ICIC Express Letters, 12, pp. 1183-1193; Gomes, G.F., De Almeida, F.A., Junqueira, D.M., Da Cunha, S.S., Jr., Ancelotti, A.C., Jr., Optimized damage identification in CFRP plates by reduced mode shapes and GA-ANN methods (2019) Engineering Structures, 181, pp. 111-123; Zhao, R., Yan, R., Chen, Z., Mao, K., Wang, P., Gao, R.X., (2019) TITLE Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 115, pp. 213-237; Khodabandehlou, H., Pekcan, G., Fadali, M.S., (2019) Structural Control and Health Monitoring, 26, p. e2308; Gunawan, F.E., Soewito, B., Surantha, N., Mauritsius, T., One more reason to reject manuscript about machine learning for structural health monitoring (2018) 2018 Indonesian Association for Pattern Recognition International Conference (INAPR)., pp. 62-66. , IEEE, 2018; Zhang, C., Cheng, L., Qiu, Q., Ji, H., Ji, J., Deep learning and its applications to machine health monitoring (2019) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 123, pp. 316-332; Farrar, C.R., Worden, K., (2012) Structural Health Monitoring: A Machine Learning Perspective., , John Wiley & Sons; Kopsaftopoulos, F., Fassois, S., Vibration based health monitoring for a lightweight truss structure: Experimental assessment of several statistical time series methods (2010) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 24, pp. 1977-1997; Kopsaftopoulos, F.P., Fassois, S.D., Scalar and vector time series methods for vibration based damage diagnosis in a scale aircraft skeleton structure (2011) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, 49, pp. 727-756. , 2011; Fassois, S.D., Sakellariou, J.S., Time-series methods for fault detection and identification in vibrating structures (2007) Philosophical Transactions of Royal Society A, 365, pp. 411-448","Gunawan, F.E.; Industrial Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: fgunawan@binus.edu","NahryMarthanty D.R.",,"American Institute of Physics Inc.","16th International Conference on Quality in Research, QiR 2019 - 2019 International Symposium on Advances in Mechanical Engineering, ISAME 2019","22 July 2019 through 24 July 2019",,164750,0094243X,9780735419865,,,"English","AIP Conf.

This research focuses on the reliability of the Power Spectral Density (PSD) method via the use of the F statistic for damage detection. To the author best knowledge, the method is rather classic but its realibility has not been discussed in the context of a large data size. Priory, the research anticipates that the accuracy is a function of the damage level. In this study, we evaluate 3500 cases with five levels of structural integrity, namely, healthy condition and damaged conditions with 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20% damage levels. The dataset is established via a numerical analysis of a seven degree-of-freedom system loaded with a concentrated dynamic force with random magnitude. A spring on the system is reduced in its stiffness to simulate damages. Our significant findings are the following: it is challenging for the PSD-based method to differentiate the healthy condition from the damaged conditions when the damage level is small. However, the reliability is high at 95% probability when the structural integrity has dropped by five percent. © 2020 Author(s).",,,,,,,,"Gunawan, F.E., (2018) ICIC Express Letters, 12, pp. 1183-1193; Gopalakhrishnan, S., Ruzzene, M., Hanagud, S., (2011) Computational Techniques for Structural Health Monitoring., , Springer; Higgins, S., Inspection of steel-tired wheels (1895) Proceedings of New York Railroad; Farrar, C.R., Worden, K., (2012) Structural Health Monitoring: A Machine Learning Perspective, , John Wiley & Sons; Gunawan, F.E., Soewito, B., Surantha, N., Mauritsius, T., One more reason to reject manuscript about machine learning for structural health monitoring (2018) 2018 Indonesian Association for Pattern Recognition International Conference (INAPR), pp. 62-66; Khodabandehlou, H., Pekcan, G., Fadali, M.S., (2019) Structural Control and Health Monitoring, 26, p. e2308; Chang, C.-M., Lin, T.-K., Chang, C.-W., (2018) Measurement, 129, pp. 457-470; Gomes, G.F., De Almeida, F.A., Junqueira, D.M., Da Cunha, S.S., Jr., Ancelotti, A.C., Jr., (2019) Engineering Structures, 181, pp. 111-123; Zhang, C., Cheng, L., Qiu, J., Ji, H., Ji, J., (2019) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 123, pp. 316-332; Fassois, S.D., Sakellariou, J.S., (2007) Philosophical Transactions of Royal Society A, 365, pp. 411-448; Kopsaftopoulos, F., Fassois, S., (2010) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 24, pp. 1977-1997; Kopsaftopoulos, F.P., Fassois, S.D., (2011) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, 49, pp. 727-756; Valverde-Albacete, F.J., Peláez-Moreno, C., (2014) PloS One, 9, p. 84217; Worden, K., Farrar, F.R., Manson, G., Park, G., Proceedings of the royal society of london a: Mathematical (2007) Physical and Engineering Sciences, 463, pp. 1639-1664; Schilling, R.J., Harris, S.L., (2011) Fundamentals of Digital Signal Processing Using MATLAB., , Cengage Learning; Gunawan, F.E., (2016) Inverse Problems in Science and Engineering, 24, pp. 1107-1132; Powers, D.M.W., (2007) Evaluation: From Precision, Recall, and F-factor to ROC, Informedness, Markedness & Correlation, School of Informatics and Engineering, , Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia, Technical Report SIE-07-001; Alamdari, M.M., (2015) Vibration-based Structural Health Monitoring, , PhD thesis, University of Technology, Sydney, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering; Salawu, O., (1997) Engineering Structures, 19, pp. 718-723","Gunawan, F.E.; Industrial Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: fgunawan@binus.edu","NahryMarthanty D.R.",,"American Institute of Physics Inc.","16th International Conference on Quality in Research, QiR 2019 - 2019 International Symposium on Advances in Mechanical Engineering, ISAME 2019","22 July 2019 through 24 July 2019",,164750,0094243X,9780735419865,,,"English","AIP Conf.

The most important thing in security systems is the process of encryption and authentication. Various encryption techniques are developed to overcome security problems of the data. One of the methods used for authentication of data is Zero Knowledge Proof. This method works to identify the authenticity of someones statement to proof without showing any knowledge of the statement mentioned. This research will mainly discuss about the security of data transmission system by combining data encryption and data authentication. The proposed data encryption is using Advanced Encryption System and method for authentication of data using the Zero Knowledge Proof. This research will conduct the development methods of authentication Zero Knowledge Proof from previous research and the result was compared with the proposed method based on the simulation results transmission system client and server. Experiments will be conducted using thirty-text data, each of data will be measured on the performance of both encryption and authentication process between the previous method and proposed method.

Therefore, many applications that require a high level of security are not allowed to run on rooted device. Common technique of detecting rooted device is by using Android API to discover rooting trace. However, the detection can be bypassed using Java function hooking script by the people who want to run the app on rooted device. This research will give illustration that the bypassing process becomes more easy with automation tool and hybrid analysis. In order to create the script, we use combination of static and dynamic analysis with three phases with specific function. Phase 1 aims to detect the estimated Java method that detect rooting, phase 2 will analyze that method on an unrooted device, then phase 3 will create the bypassing script based on the previous result. We also use automation tool to speed up the static analysis. We create two types of script: one that can be used on general application, and the other one that only can be used on specific app. Those types implement different scope: one with the certain Java method, and the other one with specific parameter or return value. In the end, we find that bypassing rooting detection is not complicated if the app use Java function to detect the rooted device. To complicate bypassing process, we encourage the developers to implement more advanced detection rooting technique. © 2020 The Authors","Android rooting; Java hooking; Rooting detection; Rooting detection bypass",,,,,"Kementerian Riset, Teknologi dan Pendidikan Tinggi: 12/AKM/PNT/2019, 039/VR","The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia for their support in making this research possible.

This condition was supported by increasing use of smartphones which have been embedded a wireless technology such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and other latest technologies in its development. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) has become one of candidate wireless technologies for IPS implementation. Many researchers have carried out various studies on indoor positioning and localization using BLE technologies. However, most of studies still focus on how to find the methods and algorithms that can be used to obtain distance and accuracy, few specifically focus on the scheme and placement of BLE. Therefore, this research was conducted to find the most optimal scheme and placement of BLE. In this paper is proposed a scheme by combining placement of BLE using the fingerprinting and weighted sum method.

The development of the ballistocardiography (BCG) sensor enables the possibility of dayto-day and portable monitoring at home. The goal of this study is to develop an IoT sleep quality monitoring system using BCG sensors, microcontrollers and cloud servers. The BCG sensor produces ECG data from the physical activity of the patient. The data is sent to the sensor and is read by the microcontroller. The sensor data is collected and pre-processed in the microcontroller. The microcontroller then transmits the data obtained from the BCG sensor to the cloud server for further analysis, i.e. to assess the sleep quality. The assessment of data transmission efficiency and resource consumption is carried out in this paper. The findings of the evaluation show that the proposed method achieves higher efficiency, lower response time and decreases memory usage by up to 77% compared to the conventional method. © 2013 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization.","Ballistocardiography; ECG; HRV; Internet-of-things; Sleep quality",,,,,"039/VR, RTT/IV/2019","This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled ""Prototipe dan Aplikasi Monitoring Kualitas Tidur Portabel berbasis Teknologi Cloud Computing dan Machine Learning"" or ""Portable Sleep Quality Monitoring Prototype and Application based on Cloud Computing Technology and Machine Learning"" with contract number: 039/VR.

We intimately record the interaction between the students and the slides by an eye-tracking device. From the data, we trace the students' gazing points from one word to another word, sentence to sentence. The study involves 30 sophomores and junior students learning materials presented on 52 slides. Some notabled results are the following. Most students gaze to all words on each slide on the first 20 slides only. Afterward, the number of gazed words decreases quickly and linearly with time. In some cases, 50% of students scan the information with improper order, potentially leading to an incorrect understanding. However, the proportion is reduced by 17% on the average when the slides are designed with a zebra-striping pattern. © 2019 IEEE.","Eye Tracker; Fixation Point","Engineering education; Eye tracking; Eye tracking devices; Powerpoint; Striping pattern; Students learning; Students",,,,,,"Abdelrahman, L.A.M., Attaran, M., Hai-Leng, C., What does powerpoint mean to you?

Reasons for educational institutions to use cloud computing as a means of learning include cloud service providers providing sizable hardware and software resources, so educational institutions do not have to pay a large amount of money to buy hardware and software as an investment. But as long as this online learning system runs there will definitely be risks, for example performance problems from internet network connections. This study aims to discuss this problem. Methodology/approach In this study, firstly identifying dangerous or harmless activities to the activities carried out in cloud computing, then determining the impact, aspects, likelihood and severity of risks, and finally determining the level of risk from these activities using a risk matrix. Finding- By using a risk register in the learning system, risk analysis and evaluation can show the Incident, Cause, impact, risk type, risk category, aspect, likelihood, severity, and risk level for each dangerous or non-hazardous activity. Originality/value - The tools used to measure the level of risk for dangerous or non-hazardous activities for the learning system can be used for more extensive research aimed at measuring institutional-level risks in the education sector © 2019 IEEE.","learning system; risk assessment; risk level; risk register","Cloud computing; E-learning; Engineering education; Hazards; Online systems; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Analysis and evaluation; Cloud service providers; Educational institutions; Hardware and software; Network connection; On-line learning systems; Performance problems; Service facilities; Learning systems",,,,,,"Huth, A., Cebula, J., (2011) The Basics of Cloud Computing, pp. 1-4; Gholami, A., Laure, E., (2015) Security and Privacy of Sensitive Data in Cloud Computing : A Survey of Recent Developments, pp. 131-150; Mahesh, (2016) Data Security and Security Controls in Cloud Computing, pp. 11-13; Esposito, C., Castiglione, A., (2017) Challenges of Connecting Edge and Cloud Computing : A Security and Forensic Perspective, pp. 13-17; Shareeful, I., Fenz, S., Weippl, E., Mouratidis, H., (2017) A Risk Management Framework for Cloud Migration Decision Support; Kozlov, A.D., Noga, N.L., Risk management for information security of corporate information systems using cloud technology (2018) Elev.

The evaluated exertion in the UCP method gets from the increase between the UCP esteem and the Effort Value (ER). The expense of ER is the extent of structure of working hours required for each utilization. Determination of ER values only uses data software development projects with simple linear regression analysis. However, most researchers refer to the proposed ER value without questioning or reviewing the ER value. This study evaluates the ER values for software development projects in the business field, namely the Health Surveillance Application. In conducting this research, we need several data on software development projects in the Health Surveillance field from this data. We can find the ER value by analyzing correlation and linear equations. The final results of this study get the benefit of ER 8.0. This price is lower than the quantity suggested by past scientists. Decreasing the ER value can reduce the estimated amount of the effort, then the decrease in estimated business value will reduce the resources needed for software development. May be due to a development project as a component or framework that facilitates project developmen, this is possible for several reasons, including more advanced software engineering technology, rapid growth. © 2019 IEEE.","health surveillance application; Size of software; software metrics; use case point","Application programs; Computer aided software engineering; Health; Monitoring; Regression analysis; Business value; Development project; Health surveillances; Simple linear regression analysis; Software development projects; Software metrics; Use case points; Working hours; Software design",,,,,,"https://www.maxmanroe.com/ini-penyebab-kegagalan-startupmenurut-dua-tokoh-startup-indonesia.html; Group, S., (2011) Reports of Chaos, , http:/standishgroup.com/news, Accessed on 1 June 2013; Tokey, Steve, Steve, (2010) Software Return: Maximizing Your Software Investment Return, , Prentice-Hall; Galorath, D., Evans, M.W., (2008) Sizing Software, Estimate, and Risk Management, , Auerbach, in; Endy, M., (2011) Estimated Project of Software, , http:/software.endy.muhardin.com/estimate-probesoftware/, Retrieved March 7, 2013; Ochodek, M., Nawrocki, J., Kwarciak, K., (2011) Simplifying Estimation Effort Based on Use Case Points, , Sciencedirect; Karner, G., (1993) Resource Estimation for Objectory Projects, , Objective System SF AB; Clemmons, R.K., (2006) Use Case Point Project Estimation, , Technical Services Diversified, Inc; https://mx.123dok.com/document/7q01eggzsoftware-projects-effort-estimation-using-use-case-points-method-in-the-context-of-project-management-bodyof-knowledge, Retrieved from; http://elearning.upnjatim.ac.id/courses/REKAYASAPERANGKATLUNAKPAGI/document/slidekuliah/Software_Process_Model_1.ppt?cidReq=REKAYASAPERANGKATLUNAKPAGI, Accessed on July 12, 2013; Robiola, G., Ricardo, O., (2008) Using Case to Early Estimate Effort with Simpler Metrics, , Springer publishing house London Limited; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_Case_Points#Unadjusted_Use_Case_Weight_(UUCW)_2",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","4th International Conference on Informatics and Computing, ICIC 2019","23 October 2019 through 24 October 2019",,157590,,9781728122076,,,"English","Proc.

Data from the satellite usually have lower accuracy than other expensive methods e.g. drone, aerial view, etc. However, the data from satellite have wide range area and sufficient enough for modeling a land use. The accuracy assessment, therefore, becomes a vital task to ensure the model from the satellite imagery meets the minimum requirement. Validating the classification result by comparing to the real location or by other higher resolution images is needed. The paper proposed additional validation by comparing the classification result by another result in different date through the cross-tabulation method. Two satellite imageries in the same year were processed before classification to get the land-use and land-cover classification. Comparing two land-use classified images gave the accuracy statistics using cross-tabulation. The kappa statistic and accuracy showed the classification performance of 0.7592 that similar to the sampling-based accuracy assessment (0.75390). Therefore, the proposed method was appropriate as the accuracy assessment. © 2019 IEEE.","cross-tabulation; kappa statistic; land-use classification; satellite imagery","Antennas; Land use; Satellite imagery; Accuracy measurements; Classification performance; Classification results; cross-tabulation; Higher resolution images; Kappa statistic; Land-use and land cover classifications; Landuse classifications; Image classification",,,,,,"Handayanto, R., Tripathi, N.K., Kim, S.M., Herlawati, H., Land use growth simulation and optimization for achieving a sustainable urban form (2018) TELKOMNIKA (Telecommunication Comput.

The project manager or project owner really needs a good calculation so that the use of resources can be done more efficiently. Use Case Points (UCP) is one method that can be used to measure the size of a software based on a use case diagram. Use case diagrams are usually made before the application begins to be developed into the application. In the calculation of UCP, there are 2 additional factors carried out: Technical Complexity Factor (TCF) and Environmental Factor (EF). This paper presents measurement software using use case points on the SIB mobile application. This application has never been measured both in terms of cost and size of the project. The results of the use case points method produce a UCP value of 129.86 and Effort Estimation (Effort) value of 1298.6 hours. With these results, the project manager gets a picture of the project so that the efficiency of the resources can be carried out properly. © 2019 ISSN.","Mobile application; Software cost; Software metric; Software size; Use case points",,,,,,,"(2018) Number of Apps Available in Leading App Stores as of 3rd Quarter 2018, , https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores; Kashyap, D., Shukla, D., Misra, A.

The admissibility of digital evidence depends on sever-al factors, including improper handling, virus infection, deliberate tampering, or faultyhardware that might compromise its integrity. The integrity of digital evidence is highlydependent on use of a cryptographic hash function to provide a seal on the evidence. Inthis paper, we analyze the causes of evidence inadmissibility to the courts, specifically dur-ing a chain of custody in which the evidence is passed from one investigator to another,and therefore is at risk of compromise. We introduce a confidence level of admissibility toidentify the percentage of trust accorded to evidence. When the level of integrity is intact,then the confidence level of admissibility is 100%. For evidence under investigation, theconfidence level is reduced as the changes have been made to the documents. We proposea framework for establishing the confidence level of evidence admissibility. Based on thisframework, we construct a model that enables the calculation of the confidence level ofadmissibility, from which we can produce a history log for document traceability. © 2019, ICIC International.

In the daily operation of IT Service Management (ITSM) in Computer laboratory, service activities in computer laboratory mostly uncontrolled and not standardized. By maximizing the service standard level in computer laboratory, university could maintain customer satisfaction subsequently.

It is also what programmers spend much time on. Therefore, many tools to ease the user interface development are available. Many of them are part of integrated development environment (IDE) of programming languages. Some of them are more generic and available for a few user interface toolkits or programming languages. However, these tools usually assume their users are targeting specific platform: desktop, web, or mobile application. While generic tools are sometimes generous enough, they usually cannot make it totally independent of underlying toolkit or programming languages. Modeling tools exist, but it means learning something new. This is one of the backgrounds for what we propose in this paper. An application user interface model based on spreadsheet: software packages that have been around for almost four decades. We emphasize multiplatform output: design once and output in several platforms (we provide two: desktop and web; adaptable to more). We do not assume a specific toolkit or programming language, but we still care about styles. Our experiments prove this method is usable and results in quicker user interface prototyping—even for professional programmers—with development time comparison ranging from 26.7% (best) to 80%. © BEIESP.","Code generation; Programming language; Spreadsheet; User interface; User interface modeling",,,,,,"Dr. Ford Lumban Gaol is currently Associate Professor Informatics Engineering and Information System, Bina Nusantara University.

All ideas from the development of intelligent transportation to a town that wants to build and want to change into a smart city, especially in the field of ACP (system created, computing developed), based on parallel management and control system (PTMS). PTMS is considered to be enlarged to a new generation of an intelligent transportation system, and its essential component of architecture then make the hardware and software that will support a new architecture in a developing city to a smart city. The case in a lift is a communication system on a car that uses peer to peer networks and smart cards, with a communication system in a vehicle is expected to control congestion in a developing city through an original town with a connected system. This paper proposed four aspects of surveillance such as Traffic surveillance, vehicle Surveillance, passenger surveillance and driver surveillance. The combination of these surveillances will create best applied Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) or can be called as Smart Transportation Systems(STS). © 2018 IEEE.","Intelligent Transportation Systems;

This work discussed a solution designed to solve common operational project problems, especially in attendance and tasklist management activity in companies who has employee working outside of the office. Considering the number of employees who have to visit various places, conventional attendance system is no longer feasible as be the solution. Similar problem occured in tasklist management, with so many employees to manage in different places will make it difficult for Project Manager to assign task and monitor the progress. Based on the problems, solusion was then designed using SDLC Waterfall using the field research data.

Depending on the experiences and languages, developing a web application could be a simple or complex task. It is complex because the programmer should use more than one languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, language at the server side, and others). To reduce the number of languages, programmers may use domain-specific languages. The more specific the language, the simpler the development could be. However, some researches show that language specificity itself could be another challenge. Therefore, to make web application development simpler and at the same time make the domain-specific language useful, more research is needed. We propose the usage of spreadsheet – software packages that have been around for about four decades. We emphasize simple modeling technique, combined with column/row based syntax, saved as comma-separated values (CSV) file format, which can be interpreted as a fully functional web application. Experiments prove this method is usable and results in simpler web application development with significantly less development time (43%) and lines of code (30%) compared with standard web technologies.

Due to the difference in sleep stage proportion for every person, the collected sleep stage data are imbalanced naturally, which can lead to high probability of misclassification. Various learning method has been developed to classify sleep stage based on electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no researches which consider the imbalanced dataset problem for sleep stage classification. In this research, a classification model of sleep stage based on ECG signal was developed using Weighted Extreme Machine Learning (WELM) to deal with imbalanced learning dataset and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. The research will use the MIT-BIH Polysomnographic Database, which contains 10154 sleep stage annotated ECG data which consist of 17.79%, 38.28%, 4.76%, 1.78%, 6.89%, and 30.5% data of NREM1, NREM2, NREM3, NREM4, REM, and awake stage respectively. From each ECG record, a total of 18 features were extracted and the feature selection process resulted in 10 features which highly affect the sleep stage classification. The proposed model successfully obtained a mean accuracy of 78,78% for REM, NREM and Wake stage classification and 73.09% for Light Sleep, Deep Sleep, REM, and Wake stage classification. © 2019 The Authors.

Transfering data from the sensor via the internet network to a monitoring device must be less than 300 ms. One process that can cause non-fulfillment of these requirements is a method for displaying the data on a monitor. There are several methods for delivering data from the sensor to a monitor. This paper has been compared between two methods, namely the polling method and the websocket method. The experiment was conducted to compare these two method. The result obtained that the websocket method was better in presenting real time data compared to the polling method. It can be shown in bandwidth usage and memory usage. In the experiment was found that the average of bandwidth usage is 478KB for polling method, and 91KB for web socket method in web based and the memory consumption of websocket less as much as 16% compared to polling method. In android smartphone the average bandwidth usage is 5.1 KB for web socket method and 15 KB for polling method and the memory consumption of websocket less as much as 22% compared to polling method. © 2019 The Authors.

In this research, we propose a classification method on the basis of the general vibration model. The general vibration model is essentially a set of differential equations describing the dynamics of the structure under consideration. For the purpose of damage detection, a deviation of the general vibration model from the dynamic equilibrium point marks the occurrence of the damage. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we study two simplest dynamical systems consisting of one- and two-concentrated masses subjected to a prescribed dynamic load. The structural damages are introduced artificially by reducing the stiffness of spring in the structures. We find that the general vibration model is more sensitive to damages than the traditional methods. © 2019 The Authors.

For a reason, recently, many attempts have been endured to reduce the emission and to increase fuel efficiency, including vehicle platooning, better driving strategy, and increasing engine efficiency. This study intends to provide a more detail assessment regarding the effects of the driving strategy to fuel consumption. For the purpose, the vehicle dynamics are quantified by employing the car-following model based on the optimal velocity model. The fuel consumption is estimated from the regression model of Ahn18. The result suggests that the braking distance strongly affects fuel consumption. © 2019 The Authors.

At the core of the system lies an algorithm for classification of damages. This work intends to establish such an algorithm. In the current proposal, the algorithm receives data of the probe vehicle rate of rotations, extracts statistics descriptive from the data to produce a feature vector, and finally, feeds the vector to a simple-three-layer neural network to classify the damages. The types of damages are limited to four cases: normal, pothole, speed bump, and expansion joint. For the development, a probe vehicle is used to produce 400 empirical data involving those four damage cases. By using Monte Carlo approach, the established neural network model is evaluated. The results show that the approach is able to classify the cases with 85% accuracy. The study also finds that the rates of pitch and roll to be the determining factors. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

A great amount of researches aimed to realize a tracking system that works inside a building. However, only few researches uses BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). In a tracking system using BLE, its position strongly determines the accuracy of the position of the object. Therefore, the goal of this research was to develop a positioning system using Bluetooth generation 4 and Bluetooth Low Energy based on the distance measurement. In this research, the trilateration technique applied at 4 models position was analyzed: AOTG (All on the Ground), UBS (Upper Beacon and Smartphone), UBLS (Upper Beacon Lower Smartphone) and LBUS (Lower Beacon Upper Smartphone). The experiment provided in this paper indicated that the best result achieved from the four models is shown by AOTG models with the direct line of sight between a beacon and a smartphone, which was fulfilled. The average error generated is 0.771meter. The second best result has been given by LBUS that has an average error of 0.841 meter. The third best result has been given by UBS that has an average error of 1.061 meter and the worst one has been given by UBLS that has an average error of 1.217 meter. © 2018 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.

Localization techniques using this satellite cannot work in buildings; therefore research for localization techniques in buildings has been the focus of researchers in the last decade. Localization techniques in the area that cannot be covered by satellite can be split into two groups namely techniques signal using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and techniques using the access point or Wi-Fi. Most researcher still face problems in localization technique in building known as Indoor Position System (IPS) implementation, especially to escalation the precision of techniques. In this paper, we presented a assessment of the papers (2006-2016) on indoor position system that focus on accuracy and placement of sensor for both BLE and Wi-Fi.

This metrics used to identify measurable properties of the code and relation between them. Several measures can be calculated with this method are program vocabulary, program length, volume, difficulty and effort. In learning process, the final result obtained by students should be linear with the results obtained each time the students doing their exercises. This study aims to see the pattern similarity relationship between coding that students do on each exercise in term of difficulty, programming effort and programming time with the final value that they obtained. The experiment was done by giving the students three sets of exercise questions which were derived from the final problem, then each set of exercise code done by each students measured using halstead method and compare with the final grade obtained by each student. © 2018 IEEE.","halstead; pattern; programming; software metric","Codes (symbols); Mathematical programming; Complexity measures; halstead; Learning process; pattern; Pattern similarity; Programming time; Software metrices; Software metrics; Students",,,,,,"Arpaia, P., Bernardi, M.L., Di Lucca, G., Inglese, V., Spiezia, G., An aspect-oriented programming-based approach to software development for fault detection in measurement systems (2010) Comput.

In recent years there have been several studies that have used games, especially computer-based ones to improve the executive function of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) especially in working memory improvements. There are still several obstacles in using computer-based games that have been circulating today in Indonesia. The aim of this research is to develop and create a prototype game that can be used to improve working memory of children with ADHD using Bahasa Indonesia. The prototype game application is a race game with matching colors and memory work tasks; developed using Construct2. Players will play as a driver, delivering certain fruits to specific homes with different colors. The game also included visuospatial tasks such as remembering the objects. For performance test, CPU utilization, average FPS and image memory usage has been tested in several browsers. In conclusion, the performance tests results show that the first type of the prototype game is good enough to be played in desktop or laptop. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Software prototyping; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; CPU utilization; Executive function; Game for children; Image memory; Performance tests; Work task; Working memory; Computer games",,,,,,"https://newzoo.com/about, Newzoo [Internet].

Every year, the number of mobile application is increased. It is important for mobile application project owners to calculate the required resources before building a mobile application. In software metric, Use Case Points method is able to count software size of mobile application based on their functionality. This method utilizes use case diagram as their computation factors in the estimation process. Moreover, two other complexity factors are also considered in this method, which are: Technical Complexity Factor and Environment Factor. In this paper, we present software size calculation of QuestDone Mobile Application using 7 steps use case points method. QuestDone has been implemented, but we do not know its software size (i.e. how big the software, how much it cost, how many people is needed). As the result from use case points method, the Use Case Points value of QuestDone is 126.88 with Effort Estimation equal to 889 hours. The software size estimation process of QuestDone Mobile Application detailed in this paper can give an insight to project owners to count software size of other similar projects. © 2017 IEEE.","mobile application; software metrics; software size; use case points","Artificial intelligence; Mobile computing; Environment factors; Estimation process; Mobile applications; Software metrics; Software size; Software size estimation; Technical complexity; Use case points; Application programs",,,,,,"Costello, S., How Many Apps Are in the App Store?""

The first two offer more flexibilities but greatly differ in complexities. General-purpose language is probably overkill for a simple data entry application. In order to be useful, domain-specific language should be as close as possible to the problem domain and still open to research. This paper presents Perkedel, a domain-specific programming language designed for data entry. It is inspired by spreadsheet concept and offers user interface definitions that resemble a paper-based data entry form. Spreadsheet is one of the most popular programming systems that has been around us for almost four decades and we argue that easy user interface definition is important. This results in writing source code for a data entry application that looks nothing like ordinary source code. This speeds up the development time, too. One of our respondents spent only five minutes to a develop a simple data entry application, compared to the fastest development time of 32 minutes using a generalpurpose language, for similar application. That way, we hope that Perkedel may add a little perk to data entry developer's life using this data entry language. © 2017 IEEE.","data entry; domain-specific programming language; programming language; spreadsheet","Ada (programming language); Artificial intelligence; Computer programming languages; Data acquisition; Problem oriented languages; Spreadsheets; Development time; Domain specific languages; Domain specific programming languages; General purpose languages; General-purpose programming language; Problem domain; Programming system; Source codes; User interfaces",,,,,,"Soewito, N.B., Gaol, F.L., Abbas, B.S., Multi-platform application user interface design (2017) The International Conference on Advanced Management and Information Technology Service; Van Deursen, A., Klint, P., Domain-specific language design reqires feature description (2002) Journal of Computing and Information Technology, 10 (1), pp. 1-7; Van Deursen, A., Klint, P., Visser, J., (2000) Domain-Specific Language: An Annotated Bibliography, Sigplan Notices, 35 (6), pp. 26-36; Ayalew, Y., Clermont, M., Mittermeir, R.T., Detecting Errors in Spreadsheets, , arXiv preprint arXiv: 0805.1740, 2008; Abraham, R., Burnett, M., Erwig, M., Spreadsheets programming (2008) Wiley Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Engineering; Power, D.J., A brif history of spreadsheets (2004) DSSResources.Com; Nardi, B.A., Miller, J.R., (1990) The Spreadsheets Interface: A Basic for End User Programming, , Hewlett-Packard Laboratories; Sebesta, R.W., (2012) Concepts of Programming Language, , 10 th ed, Pearson Education Inc; Spinellis, D., Notable design patterns for domain specific language (2001) Journal of Systems and Software, 56 (1), pp. 91-99; Mernik, M., Heering, J., Sloane, A.M., When and how to develop domain specific language (2005) ACM Comuting Surveys (CSUR), 37 (4), pp. 316-344",,,"IEEE Indonesia","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2017 IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Computational Intelligence, CyberneticsCOM 2017","20 November 2017 through 22 November 2017",,135216,,9781538607831,,,"English","IEEE Int.

However, testing process is a time-consuming activity that requires good planning and a lot of resources. Therefore, technique and methodology for predicting the testing effort is important process prior the testing process to significantly increase efficiency of time, effort and cost usage. Correspond to software metric usage for measuring software quality, software metric can be used to identify the faulty modules in software. Furthermore, implementing machine learning technique will allow computer to 'learn' and able to predict the fault prone modules. Research in this field has become a hot issue for more than ten years ago. However, considering the high importance of software quality with support of machine learning methods development, this research area is still being highlighted until this year. In this paper, a survey of various software metric used for predicting software fault by using machine learning algorithm is examined. According to our review, this is the first study of software fault prediction that focuses to PROMISE repository dataset usage. Some conducted experiments from PROMISE repository dataset are compared to contribute a consensus on what constitute effective software metrics and machine learning method in software fault prediction. © 2017 IEEE.","machine learning algorithm; software defect prediction; Software metric; software testing","Artificial intelligence; Computer software selection and evaluation; Forecasting; Learning systems; Life cycle; Software design; Software testing; Fault-prone modules; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Machine learning techniques; Software defect prediction; Software development life cycle; Software fault prediction; Software metrices; Learning algorithms",,,,,,"Kumar, L., Krishna, S., Sureka, A., Ku, S., Effective fault prediction model developed using Least (2017) Square Support; Kumudha, P., Venkatesan, R., Cost-sensitive radial basis function neural network classifier for software (2016) Defect Prediction, 2016; Malhotra, R., Jain, A., Fault prediction using statistical and machine learning methods for improving software quality (2012) J.

ZYX as a mobile telecommunication service provider cannot be relied as the solution to solve addressing needs against subscriber growth in future technology. Meanwhile, native IPv6 deployment is currently application-driven, which requires maturity support in either subscriber user equipment, network, and application itself. IPv4/IPv6 dual stack deployment was selected by PT. ZYX as stepping stone towards native IPv6 deployment. This paper analyzes the impact of dual stack IPv4/IPv6 deployment for mobile subscribers at PT. ZYX. After selecting the dual stack approach and completing the deployment, test and measurements were performed to confirm the connectivity also against the performance and node utilization to conclude the impact. The test confirmed successful connectivity and the measurements showed that the deployment gives significant enhancement of routing table size and NAT table in node utilization and does not cause performance drop of hop count, throughput, and download time. © 2018 KIPMI","Connectivity; Deployment; IPv4/IPv6 dual stack; Mobile subscribers; Node utilization; Performance",,,,,,,"https://www.ripe.net/publications/ipv6-info-centre/about-ipv6/ipv4-exhaustion, IPv4 Exhaustion RIPE Network Coordination Centre, (n.d).

Most organizations still face problems in EA implementation, EA Development is not an easy task. Since risk of failed EA implementation might occur, organization needs to know the Critical Success Factors (CSF) to implementation EA in organization especially in public sectors agency. This study provided a review of the extent literature (2007-2017) on framework that used to EA implementation and identify the CSF that affect to implement EA in public sectors agency. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) establish a synthesis analysis based on the research model using PRISMA checklist. The final list of selected primary studies for the first stage had 16 primary studies. Then, the full texts of 16 primary studies were analyzed. Then from that, performed the synthesis to produce Enterprise Architecture framework and factors that affect enterprise architecture implementation. Base on summarize, can be conclude that the most commonly used framework in this literature study is TOGAF and The US Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF), about 32% the public sectors using TOGAF framework to implementation EA, and about 25% public sectors using FEAF framework to implementation EA. According to the results of this study as many as 68% of papers say that the technical development is a CSF in the implementation of EA in public sector and about 50% of papers say that the framework and methodology is a CSF of implementation of EA in public sector. © 2018 The Authors.

In most cases a fiber optic network has been implemented using clustering method, where this method assumed inefficient due to the utilization of fiber optic that is not maximized, and the numbers of the Distribution Point used is more. Thus, this paper proposed new design using Voronoi diagrams in selecting the strategic location of the Distribution Point. By utilizing an image from Google map and html code, we created polygons of Voronoi based on the coordinate point of the candidate's location. The results are getting a value reduction/efficiency in context the use of the Distribution Point is 48%, reduction of unused fiber optics is from 171.23% to 39.72%, and cost efficiency is 50.39%. © 2018 The Authors.

Security in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability becomes goals that must be achieved by any system generally, and commerce system especially, because this kind of system contains many sensitive data like customer data and transaction data. SQL Injection is a vulnerability and threat, with the most occurrence in a web based system. In this research we evaluate and analyze source code against SQL injection, and we use regular expression and escape string to prevent the SQL injection. The results of this study are findings of system vulnerability against SQL injection, which are proven by the ability to get data from database, with SQL injection techniques. System vulnerabilities were analyzed, in order to design and implement the solution for it. The solutions then tested, to validate that it has proven effectively fix the vulnerabilities, and can prevent the exploitation by SQL injection. In the end, the conclusion is that initially the system is vulnerable against SQL injection, but then the solution that being implemented has proven effectively fix the issue. © 2018 The Authors.

The modern attendance system must integrated with a human resources management and payroll system. Others issues with current attendance system, beside could not control the staff who work outside the office are conventional attendance system that spends a lot of paper and a long process due to be entered manually into the system for processing payroll, while the electronic attendance system with limited device can cause queues at the time employee entry and exit the office building. In this work, we introduce online attendance system on mobile devices and is integrated with the payroll system. It is a system created to overcome some of the limitations that occur in manual or electronic attendance system which is often conventionally used today. We utilized Global Positioning System (GPS), microphone, and fingerprint scanner that available on a smartphone or others mobile devices. We developed our application base on android platform because the android is the most platforms that have been using in the most mobile devices. Using our proposed methodology, the employee can do attendance using their mobile devices and the do not need to be in queue and the employee who work outside the office also can do the attendance.

One form of TELs, that is on-screen learning, has become the topic of interest of many works. It is popular mainly with young people despite all findings, which undoubtedly suggest that it is detrimental to learning. The method hinders learning experience due to the reading spatial instability, difficulties in establishing mental map, and poor visual ergonomics. Currently, many textbooks are available in electronic form and a majority of the students in Bina Nusantara University in Indonesia, for example, consider the form to be more convenient and preferable. In the electronic form, the textbooks are much more affordable. They can be obtained easier than the printed books. This work intends to explore a method of improving the learning quality of the electronic textbooks. The improvement is expected to be achieved by enriching the electronic textbook with cues in the form of margin notes, highlights, markers, lines and arrows, and navigation tools provided by the subject matter expert. The idea is implemented on a class at the university and its effects are assessed. The participants are divided into two groups having the same distribution of the past academic performance where one group is assigned to learn using the recommendation system and the other is without the system. After the learning, their understandings are assessed systematically by qualitative and quantitative methods. The participants with the recommendation system outperform those without significantly, which is marked by the values of the Cohen’s effect size d larger than 1.20 with the standard deviation about 0.563. © 2017 IEEE.",,,,,,,,"Wertsch, J.V., Commentary on: Deliberation with computers: Exploring the distinctive contribution of new technologies to collaborative thinking and learning (2003) International Journal of Educational Research, 39 (8), pp. 899-904. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035504001028, deliberation with computers: exploring the distinctive contribution of new technologies to collaborative thinking and learning; Manouselis, N., Drachsler, H., Vuorikari, R., Hummel, H., Koper, R., Recommender systems in technology enhanced learning (2011) Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 387-415. , Springer; Eklundh, K.S., Problems in achieving a global perspective of the text in computer-based writing (1992) Instructional Science, 21 (1), pp. 73-84; Baccino, T., Pynte, J., Spatial coding and discourse models during text reading (2004) Language and Cognitive Processes, 9, pp. 143-155; Piolat, A., Roussey, J.Y., Thunin, O., Effects of screen presepresent on text reading revising (1997) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 47 (4), pp. 565-589; Mangen, A., Walgermo, B.R., Bronnick, K., Reading linear text on paper versus computer screen: Effects on reading comprehension (2013) International Journal of Educational Research, 58, pp. 61-68; Ackerman, R., Goldsmith, M., Megacognitive regulation of text learning: On screen versus on paper (2011) Journal of Experimental Phsychology: Applied, 17 (1), pp. 18-32; Garland, K.J., Noyes, J.M., Crt monitors: Do they intefere with learning?

This study intends to develop such the capability on the basis of the data of the brain waves: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. For the purpose, a number of participants are asked to participate in the study where their brain waves are recorded by using a low-cost Neurosky Mindwave EEG sensor. In the process, the participants are performing a continuous performance test from which their attention levels are directly measured in the form of the response time in conjunction to those waves. When the response time is much longer than a normal one, the participant attention is assumed to be dropped. A simple k-NN classification method is used with the k = 3. The results are the following. The best detection of the attention drop is achieved when the attention features are extracted from the earliest stage of the brain wave signals. The brain wave signal should be recorded longer than 1 s since the time the stimulus is presented as a short signal leads to a poor categorization. A significant drop in the level of response time is required to provide the brain signal that better predicts the change of the attention. © 2017 IEEE.",,,,,,,,"Bassili, J.N., Emotion recognition: The role of facial movement and the relative importance of upper and lower areas of the face (1979) American Psychological Association, 37 (11), p. 2049; Marouane, S., Najlaa, S., Abderrahim, T., Eddine, E.K., Towards measuring learners concentration in e-learning systems (2015) International Journal of Computer Techniques, 2 (5), pp. 27-29; Hindarto, H., Sumarmo, S., Feature extraction of electroencephalography signals using fast fourier transform (2016) Commit (Communication & Information Technology) Journal, 10 (1), pp. 49-52; Busso, C., Deng, Z., Yildirim, S., Bulut, M., Lee, C.M., Kazemzadeh, A., Lee, S., Narayanan, S., Analysis of emotion recognition using facial expressions, speech and multimodal information (2004) In Proceedings of the 6Th International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces.

Many students fully rely on the slides as the main learning materials and, in some cases, substituting textbooks. This study intends to understand how students interact with the learning materials presented on Powerpoint slides. The interaction is measured using an eye tracker device called the Eye Tribe Tracker. Thirty sophomore and junior students are asked to participate. They are instructed to learn a topic in the subject of Introduction to Algorithm and Programming, a basic course in the computer science field. During the process, their fixation points are monitored and are related to the contents on the slides. The results are rather surprising.

This application will map the poverty levels of the water from 8,576 villages, 573 subdistricts and 35 regencies in Central Java by using the technique of spatial data mining and the approach of the water poverty index (WPI). Seeing the magnitude of that application scope, then it needs to do the software complexity measurement to find out further the resources needed for the development of the system in the future. The measurement of the software complexity is held with the Function Point (FP) method that produces the estimation of the resource requirements such as project work effort, project duration and speed of delivery.

A wide variety of calculation methods have been widely used to estimate the size of the software, one of which is by using Function Point Analysis (FPA). Volume calculation software based on a scale of complexity. Since the point of measurement is highly subjective, in order to maintain consistency and validity of the results, the method should be run by an experienced professional. This method is then applied by the authors to measure the complexity of academic information system STIKOM Dinamika Bangsa Jambi using structured modeling approach. Measurements were performed in this study consisted of depictions information system is built into the structure. Which is then analyzed by counting models Crude Function Points (CRP), the relative complexity of Adjustment Factor (RCAF), and then calculate the point function. From the results of calculations using the FPA to software quality measurement academic system STIKOM Dinamika Bangsa Jambi obtained value FP 166.32 is good. Function point value produced will be used by developers in determining the price and the cost of software systems to be built or developed. © 2017 IEEE.","Function point analysis; Software quality measurement; Structural model; System","Computer software; Computer software selection and evaluation; Information systems; Information use; Software design; Function point analysis; Measurement quality; Point of measurement; Relative complexity; Software Quality; Structural modeling; System; Volume calculation; Quality control",,,,,,"Borade, J.G., (2013) International Journal of Advanced Research in Software Project Effort and Cost Estimation Techniques, 3 (8), pp. 730-739; Gaol, F.L., Soewito, B., Leslie, H., Spits, H., (2016) Object Oriented Metrics to measure the quality of software study case Request online System; Lee, M., Chang, T., (2013) Software Measurement and Software Metrics in Software Quality, 7 (4), pp. 15-34; Sadiq, M., Asim, M., Ahmed, J., Kumar, V., Khan, S., (2011) Prediction of Software Project Effort Estimation: A Case Study, 1 (1), pp. 37-43; Srinivasan, K.P., (2015) Unique Fundamentals of Software Measuremant And Software Metrics, 7 (4), pp. 29-43; Pratiwi, D., Pratiwi, D., (2013) Implementation of Function Point Analysis in Measuring the Volume Estimation of Software System in Object Oriented, , Implementation of Function Point Analysis in Measuring the Volume Estimation of Software System in Object Oriented and Structural Model of Academic System no.

In terms of purpose, game has two types, which is serious game and non-serious game. As learning media, serious games need to have ability to motivate its player in order to play the game until the end so the player can finish the game while understanding learning materials given in the game. Therefore, the quality of serious game should be measured, like any other software. When it comes to measure serious games, previous models can't do the job well since all of them have no way to measure the game's content, especially to measure the content that can improve player's motivation. This paper proposes a new game measurement metric to measure the game quality factors, especially to measure serious game contents that can motivate its players. The result of this paper is a metric table consisted of measureable factors and type of test to measure them. © 2017 IEEE.","Motivational factors; Quality factors; Quality measurement; Quality metric; Serious games","Computer games; Human computer interaction; Game contents; Learning materials; Learning media; Motivational factors; Quality factors; Quality measurements; Quality metrices; Video game; Serious games",,,,,,"Trisnadoli, A., Hendradjaya, B., Sunindyo, W.D., A proposal of quality model for mobile games (2015) 5th Int.

All tracking technologies always rely on GPS that works based on satellite. Unfortunately, GPS can only work outside the building, so that if we need a tracking system to be applied in the building, then we must use another technology. For tracking system in building, there are several technologies. In this paper, we discuss two technologies which are WLAN access point and bluetooth low energy (BLE) as the wireless sensor network. We compare the position accuracy of an object using WLAN access point and BLE. Both the techniques are worthy of comparison because both of them work based on received signal strength indicator. In this paper, we use the smartphone as a receiver. The signal strength will be changed into position with the help of trilateration technique. The experiment results show that WLAN access point is more accurate than using BLE. Use of access point will increase the accuracy or better error about 48% compared to use of BLE. © 2017 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.","Bluetooth low energy (BLE); Wireless LAN; Wireless sensor network",,,,,,,"Chang, X.W., Paige, C.C., An orthogonal transformation algorithm for GPS positioning (2003) Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Journal on Scientific Computing, 24 (5), pp. 1710-1732; Soewito, B., Faahakhododo, I., Gunawan, F.E., Increasing the accuracy of distance measurement between access point and smartphone (2016) The 11th International Conference on Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems (KICSS), Yogyakarta, Indonesia, pp. 1-6; Oguchi, K., Maruta, S., Hanawa, D., Human positioning estimation method using received signal strength indicator (RSSI) in a wireless sensor network (2014) Procedia Computer Science, 34, pp. 126-132; Kim, D.Y., Kim, S.H., Choi, D., Jin, S.H., Accurate indoor proximity zone detection based on time window and frequency with bluetooth low energy (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 56, pp. 88-95; Soewito, B., Ritonga, A.Y.H., Gunawan, F.E., Increasing accuracy of bluetooth low energy for distance measurement applications (2016) The 11th International Conference on Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems (KICSS), Yogyakarta, Indonesia, pp. 1-5; Galvan, C.E., Galvan-Tejada, T.I., Sandoval, E.I., Brena, R., WiFi bluetooth based combined positioning algorithm (2012) Procedia Engineering, 35, pp. 101-108; Huang, A.S., Rudolph, L., (2007) Bluetooth Essentials for Programmers, , 1st ed., Cambridge University Press; Yang, J., Wang, Z., Zhang, X., An iBeacon-based indoor positioning systems for hospitals (2015) International Journal of Smart Home, 9 (7), pp. 161-168; Heydon, R., (2012) Bluetooth Low Energy: The Developer's Handbook, , 1st ed., Prentice Hall; Li, X., Wang, J., Liu, C., A bluetooth/PDR integration algorithm for an indoor positioning system (2015) Sensors, 15 (10), pp. 24862-24885; Müller, P., Piche, R., Statistical trilateration with skew-t errors, international conference on localization and GNSS (ICL-GNSS) (2015) IEEE, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp. 1-6; Wang, X., Bischoff, O., Laur, R., Paul, S., Localization in wireless ad-hoc sensor networks using multilateration with RSSI for logistic applications (2009) Procedia Chemistry, 1 (1), pp. 461-464; Patil, S., Zaveri, M., MDS and trilateration based localization in wireless sensor network (2011) Wireless Sensor Network, 3, pp. 198-208; Kartowisastro, I.H., Local positioning system of a mobile robot: A practical perspective (2006) The 9th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision, Singapore, pp. 1-6; Mikhaylov, K., Simulation of network-level performance for bluetooth low energy (2014) The IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC), pp. 1259-1263. , Washington, DC",,,,"Pushpa Publishing House",,,,,09737006,,,,"English","Far East J.

One form of TELs, that is on-screen learning, has become the topic of interest of many works. It is popular mainly with young people despite all findings, which undoubtedly suggest that it is detrimental to learning. The method hinders learning experience due to the reading spatial instability, difficulties in establishing mental map, and poor visual ergonomics. Currently, many textbooks are available in electronic form and a majority of the students in Bina Nusantara University in Indonesia, for example, consider the form to be more convenient and preferable. In the electronic form, the textbooks are much more affordable. They can be obtained easier than the printed books. This work intends to explore a method of improving the learning quality of the electronic textbooks. The improvement is expected to be achieved by enriching the electronic textbook with cues in the form of margin notes, highlights, markers, lines and arrows, and navigation tools provided by the subject matter expert. The idea is implemented on a class at the university and its effects are assessed. The participants are divided into two groups having the same distribution of the past academic performance where one group is assigned to learn using the recommendation system and the other is without the system. After the learning, their understandings are assessed systematically by qualitative and quantitative methods. The participants with the recommendation system outperform those without significantly, which is marked by the values of the Cohen’s effect size d larger than 1.20 with the standard deviation about 0.563. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The modern attendance system must integrated with a human resources management and payroll system. Others issues with current attendance system, beside could not control the staff who work outside the office are conventional attendance system that spends a lot of paper and a long process due to be entered manually into the system for processing payroll, while the electronic attendance system with limited device can cause queues at the time employee entry and exit the office building. In this work, we introduce online attendance system on mobile devices and is integrated with the payroll system. It is a system created to overcome some of the limitations that occur in manual or electronic attendance system which is often conventionally used today. We utilized Global Positioning System (GPS), microphone, and fingerprint scanner that available on a smartphone or others mobile devices. We developed our application base on android platform because the android is the most platforms that have been using in the most mobile devices. Using our proposed methodology, the employee can do attendance using their mobile devices and the do not need to be in queue and the employee who work outside the office also can do the attendance. Our research showed that our proposed methodology can used for the next generation absence system. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

This study intends to develop such the capability on the basis of the data of the brain waves: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. For the purpose, a number of participants are asked to participate in the study where their brain waves are recorded by using a low-cost Neurosky Mindwave EEG sensor. In the process, the participants are performing a continuous performance test from which their attention levels are directly measured in the form of the response time in conjunction to those waves. When the response time is much longer than a normal one, the participant attention is assumed to be dropped. A simple k-NN classification method is used with the k = 3. The results are the following. The best detection of the attention drop is achieved when the attention features are extracted from the earliest stage of the brain wave signals. The brain wave signal should be recorded longer than 1 s since the time the stimulus is presented as a short signal leads to a poor categorization. A significant drop in the level of response time is required to provide the brain signal that better predicts the change of the attention. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Many students fully rely on the slides as the main learning materials and, in some cases, substituting textbooks. This study intends to understand how students interact with the learning materials presented on Powerpoint slides. The interaction is measured using an eye tracker device called the Eye Tribe Tracker. Thirty sophomore and junior students are asked to participate. They are instructed to learn a topic in the subject of Introduction to Algorithm and Programming, a basic course in the computer science field. During the process, their fixation points are monitored and are related to the contents on the slides. The results are rather surprising.

However, formula definition is often considered correct after tested with only one or few inputs. This may be fine with simple formula, but for more complex ones, more testings should be performed, in order to prevent solution that riddled with errors. However, writing a formula test case in spreadsheet software is not a simple task, mainly because there is no standard way to do that. In this paper, a simple spreadsheet test case application is proposed. User can define a formula, with many input variants, along with expected results. After that, application will generate a spreadsheet document, with all the needed contents for testing, along with test result. That way, user may re-check the formula and make necessary modifications (then run the test, again). Using this method, a formula can be tested first, with many input as needed, before it put in real document. All of these will impact in more productive programmers, with less time spent for debugging. © 2016 IEEE.","end-user programming; end-user software engineering; formula; spreadsheet; spreadsheet test case; testing","Application programs; Computer programming; Software engineering; Spreadsheets; Testing; End user programming; End-user software engineering; formula; Spreadsheet software; Test case; Time spent; Software testing",,,,,,"Abraham, R., Erwig, M., GoalDebug: A spreadsheet debugger for end users (2007) Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 251-260. , IEEE Computer Society, May; Abraham, R., Erwig, M., UCheck: A spreadsheet type checker for end users (2007) Journal of Visual Languages & Computing, 18 (1), pp. 71-95; Antoniu, T., Steckler, P.A., Krishnamurthi, S., Neuwirth, E., Felleisen, M., Validating the unit correctness of spreadsheet programs (2004) Software Engineering, 2004, ICSE 2004.

For the reason, a number of studies has been performed on the basis of English, German, Mandarin, Persian, and Danish languages. This work intends to develop automatic emotion recognition system on the basis of speech signal in Indonesia language. The study is limited to four emotional states, namely, happy, sad, angry, and fear. The speech data are collected from amateur actors and actresses, and are further quantified using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient to provide 48 emotion-related features. Finally, these features are used for emotion classification using Support Vector Machine method. The results suggest that the recognition can achieve about 86% of the level of accuracy. © 2016 IEEE.","Automatic emotion recognition; Indonesia language; Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC); Speech features; Support vector machine (SVM)","Speech; Speech communication; Support vector machines; Automatic emotion recognition; Emotion classification; Emotional state; Indonesia; Mel frequency cepstral co-efficient; Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients; Speech features; Support vector machine method; Speech recognition",,,,,,"Frieda, N., (1993) Moods, Emotion Episodes, and Emotions, , New York: Guilford Press; Chibelushi, C., Bourel, F., (2015) Facial Expression Recognition: A Brief Tutorial Overview. 2003, , http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCALCOPIES/CHIBELUSHI1/CCCFBFacExprRecCVonline.pdf, January.

Because the pervasiveness of the problem scale, it may only be tamed effectively and efficiently by using an automatic grooming conversation detection system. Previously, Pranoto, Gunawan, and Soewito [1] had developed a logistic model for the purpose and the model was able to achieve 95% detection accuracy. The current study intends to address the issue by using Support Vector Machine and fc-nearest neighbors classifiers. In addition, the study also proposes a low-computational cost classification method on the basis of the number of the existing grooming conversation characteristics. All proposed methods are evaluated using 150 conversation texts of which 105 texts are grooming and 45 texts are non-grooming. We identify that grooming conversations possess 17 features of grooming characteristics. The results suggest that the SVM and fc-NN are able to identify grooming conversations at 98.6% and 97.8% of the level of accuracy. Meanwhile, the proposed simple method has 96.8% accuracy. The empirical study also suggests that two among the seventeen characteristics are insignificant for the classification. © 2016 IEEE.","Grooming Classifier; k-nearest Neighbors; Online Child Grooming; Support Vector Machine","Nearest neighbor search; Support vector machines; Classification methods; Computational costs; Detection accuracy; Detection system; Empirical studies; K-nearest neighbors; Nearest neighbors; Online Child Grooming; Computer crime",,,,,,"Pranoto, H., Gunawan, F.E., Soewito, B., Logistic models for classifying online grooming conversation (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 357-365. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915020657; Olson, L.N., Daggs, J.L., Ellevold, B.L., Rogers, T.K., Entrap-ping the innocent: Toward a theory of child sexual predators luring communication (2007) Communication Theory, 17 (3), pp. 231-251; Whittle, H., Hamilton-Giachritsis, C., Beech, A., Collings, G., A review of online grooming: Characteristics and concerns (2013) Aggression and Violent Behavior, 18 (1), pp. 62-70; Soewito, B., Isa, S.M., Digital technology: The effect on connected world to computer ethic and family (2015) CommIT (Communication and Information Technology).

The problem is the strong encryption algorithm is very complex and required intensive computational that need huge power consumption and others resources in mobile devices. Furthermore, people have been using mobile devices to transfer the important information or doing commercial transactions. In this case, security is an important issue to protect the sensitive information, but in the other hand, the portable or mobile devices powered by battery that have limitation in battery lifetime. Choosing the suitable encryption-decryption algorithm to implement in the mobile devices is one of the important decisions to secure exchanging sensitive information with constraining of this source of power. In this research, We evaluate the power consumption of four Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) finalist: RC6, Serpent, Mars, and twofish with respect to the size of file using Joulemeter, PassMark BatteryMon, and Wattch. Our research showed that the Twofish algorithm is the least amount of energy to encrypt the data and the Serpent algorithm is the most need energy to encrypt the data. © 2016 IEEE.","encryption algorithm; mobile; security","Complex networks; Data privacy; Electric batteries; Electric power utilization; Mobile security; Advanced Encryption Standard; Commercial transactions; Decryption algorithm; Encryption algorithms; mobile; security; Sensitive informations; Serpent algorithm; Cryptography",,,,,,"Soewito, B., Marcellinus, Y., Hapsara, M., Secure wireless Ad Hoc networks using zero knowledge proof (2014) Journal Computer Science, 10 (12), pp. 2488-2493; Soewito, B., Vespa, L., Weng, N., Characterizing power and resource consumption of encryption/decryption in portable devices (2008) Region 5 Conference, 2008 IEEE; Anderson, R., Biham, E., Knudsen, L., Serpent: A proposal for the advanced encryption standard (1999) AES Proposal; Rivest, R.L., Robshaw, M., Sidney, R., Yin, V.L., The rc6 block cipher (1998) AES Proposal; Schneier, B., Kelsey, J., Whiting, D., Wagner, D., Hall, C., Ferguson, N., Twofish: A 128-bit block cipher (1998) AES Proposal; Burwick, C., Coppersmith, D., D'Avignon, E., Mars - A candidate cipher for aes (1999) AES Proposal, , IBM Corporation; Brooks, D., Tiwari, V., Martonosi, M., Wattch: A framework for architectural-level power analysis and optimizations (2000) Proc. of ACM ISCA-27, p. 8394. , Vancouver, BC, June; Burger, D., Austin, T.M., (1997) The SimpleScalar Tool Set, Version 2. 0, , Technical Report 1342, Department of Computer Science, University of Wisconsin in Madison, June; Gladman, B., Cryptographic Technology Interests, , http://fp.gladman.plus.com/cryptographytechnology, AES related home page",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","11th International Conference on Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems, KICSS 2016","10 November 2016 through 11 November 2016",,128387,,9781509051304,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

However, file sharing option is not always available and reliable in certain conditions. In this paper, we propose a server for SQLite database. This server will be using HTTP as communication protocol. To enable multiuser application, this server will be multithreaded. However, access to the database file will be synchronized to help prevent database corruption. And, as data-interchange format, JSON will be used. We also run several tests to make sure that proposed server is usable.

To achieve an accurate estimate some algorithmic estimation techniques proposed to eliminate or reduce inaccuracies estimation. COCOMO is a parametric model used to estimate software effort. However, so far no model has proven successful to effectively and consistently predict software effort. Parametric models are considered vulnerable when faced with the problem of non-linearity of the complex in the parameters. In recent years, some estimation technique appears using intelligent systems to predict software effort. This study uses a model Neuro-fuzzy optimized with PSO to get the right model to improve the estimation effort at NASA dataset software project. Parameter cost driver, consisting of 17 feature COCOMO will then be optimized using PSO techniques to get a better prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the results of the optimization will be trained in using the algorithm to get a prediction Neuro-fuzzy effort. The performance of the proposed estimation model will be evaluated with some other intelligent system model parameters to evaluate several criteria such as Mean Standard Error (MSE), Mean Magnitude of Relative Error (MMER), and Level Prediction (Pred). The model that best shows the error rate MSE and MMER lowest to highest Pred. © 2016 IEEE.","ANFIS; COCOMO; Effort Estimation; Particle Swarm Optimization","Budget control; Errors; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Intelligent systems; NASA; Project management; Software design; Traffic signals; ANFIS; COCOMO; Effort Estimation; Estimation techniques; Mean magnitude of relative errors; Parametric modeling; Project management process; Project planning and control; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",,,,,,"Grimstad, S., Jorgensen, M., The impact of irrelevant information on estimates of software development effort (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 Australian Software Engineering Conference, ASWEC '07 IEEE Computer Society, pp. 359-368; (2001), http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~gmp/docs/papers/extreme_chaos2001.pdf, [Online]. http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~gmp/docs/papers/extreme-chaos2001.pdf; Douglas Fisher, F., Srinivasan, Krishnamoorthy, Machine learning approaches to estimating software development effort (1995) IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 21 (2), pp. 126-137; Prabhakar, Dutta, M., Application of machine learning techniques for predicting software effort (2013) Elixir Comp.

The performance of such system strongly depends on its feature extraction methods. So far, many extraction methods have independently been studied and proposed, and the three widely adopted methods are Geometric Moment Invariant (GMI), United Moment Invariant (UMI), and Zernike Moment Invariant (ZMI). This study is performed to understand the relative performance of the three methods. For this purpose, the methods, in conjunction with Support Vector Machine classifier with RBF, and PuK kernels, are used to recognize characters taken from Char75K dataset. In addition, the combined features of GMI-UMI, GMI-ZMI, UMI-ZMI, and GMI-UMI-ZMI are also studied. The numerical results suggest the following. Among the three extraction methods, GMI, UMI, and ZMI methods, the latter two methods tend to provide better results by about 7-8% than the GMI method. Generally, when the features are combined, the results improve rather significant, about 7-8% improvement. Only the pair of GMI and UMI combination provide small or negligible improvement. Using the RBF kernel, GMI features alone result in 63% accuracy, UMI features alone 70% accuracy, and GMI-UMI combination result in 72% accuracy. Combination of UMI-ZMI features improve the accuracy significantly than each method along. We also find that the combination of the three methods, GMI-UMI-ZMI, tend to increase the accuracy significantly. The accuracy reaches the level of 96% for the RBF kernel and 89% for the PuK kernel. © 2016 IEEE.","Geometric Moment Invariant (GMI); Support Vector Machine (SVM); United Moment Invariant (UMI); Zernike Moment Invariant (ZMI)","Classification (of information); Extraction; Feature extraction; Radial basis function networks; Support vector machines; Feature extraction methods; Geometric moment; Handwriting recognition; Moment invariant; Numerical results; Relative performance; Support vector machine classifiers; Zernike moment invariants; Character recognition",,,,,,"Rashad, M., Amin, K., Hadhoud, M., Elkilani, W., Arabic character recognition using statistical and geometric moment features (2012) Electronics, Communications and Computers (JEC-ECC), 2012 Japan-Egypt Conference on, pp. 68-72. , IEEE; Wang, Y., Peyls, A., Pan, Y., Claesen, L., Yan, X., A fast selforganizing map algorithm for handwritten digit recognition (2013) Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering, pp. 177-183. , Springer; El-Feghi, I., Elmahjoub, F., Alswady, B., Baiou, A., Offline handwritten Arabic words recognition using zernike moments and hidden markov models (2010) Computer Applications and Industrial Electronics (ICCAIE), 2010 International Conference on, pp. 165-168. , IEEE; Hu, M.-K., Visual pattern recognition by moment invariants (1962) Information Theory, IRE Transactions on, 8 (2), pp. 179-187; Flusser, J., Suk, T., Zitova, B., (2009) Moments and Moment Invariants in Pattern Recognition, , John Wiley and Sons; Huang, Z., Leng, J., Analysis of hu's moment invariants on image scaling and rotation (2010) Computer Engineering and Technology (ICCET), 2010 2nd International Conference on, 7, pp. V7-476. , IEEE; Yinan, S., Weijun, L., Yuechao, W., United moment invariants for shape discrimination (2003) Robotics, Intelligent Systems and Signal Processing, 2003.

In the United States, the disease is the leading cause of death for people of most ethnicity. In Indonesia, the disease contributes 17% of the total mortality. It is also well-known that a regular or continuous monitoring the heart rate is important to minimize the fatality. At the current technological state, the monitoring method is expensive and often requires wearable sensor, which is inconvenient. This study intends to establish a relationship between the heart rate and speech signals empirically by using a regression and correlation analysis. The speech signals are analyzed through a frequency analysis using fast Fourier transformation. The results suggest that vowel 'e' speech signal has a strong correlation to the heart rate. © 2016 IEEE.","Fast Fourier Transform; Heart Rate; Vowel Speech Signals","Audio signal processing; Fast Fourier transforms; Linguistics; Monitoring; Pathology; Speech; Speech communication; Continuous monitoring; Correlation analysis; Empirical relations; Fast Fourier transformations; Heart rates; Monitoring methods; Speech signals; Strong correlation; Heart",,,,,,"Zennifa, F., Kamil, H., Iramina, K., Prototype early warning system for heart disease detection using android application (2014) The 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC), pp. 3468-3471. , IEEE; Duc, L., (2015) Indonesia: Coronary Heart Disease, , http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/indonesia-coronary-heart-disease, Online.

This paper deals with the prediction of development in tourism hospitality in Slovakia. To evaluate the level of development in hospitality industry means to take into account especially indicators such as the amount of accommodation establishments and their occupancy percentage rate. There are many aspects that influence the level of the services in accommodation establishments. However, there are some differences in the development of accommodation establishments and the hotels as their integral part. To make prediction, the statistical methods for trend description are used. The strength of correlation dependence between the number of bed places and occupancy rate creates conditions for further positive development of occupancy in accommodation establishments. The analysis also pointed to favorable developments in the occupancy of hotels, compared with the accommodation establishments in general. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Correlation dependence; Hospitality industry; Integral part; Occupancy rate; Slovakia; Knowledge management",,,,,,"Baker, M., Magnini, V.P., The evolution of services marketing, hospitality marketing and building the constituency model for hospitality marketing (2016) International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 28 (8); Brotherton, B., (2015) Researching Hospitality and Tourism, , London: SAGE Publications Ltd; Chon, K.S., (1999) The Practice of Graduate Research in Hospitality and Tourism, , New York: The Haworth Hospitality Press; Ivanov, S., Ivanova, M., Market penetration of hotel chains: Does culture matter?

The integrity of the digital evidence must be maintained through the chain of custody in order to be admissible in court. Most digital extraction tool use either MD5 (Message Digest) or SHA (Secured Hash Algorithm) hashing to check the integrity of digital evidence. The hashing algorithm has been found to have a weakness known as collision in which two different messages have the same hashing values. Although the probability of producing such weakness is very small, this collision can be used to deny the usage of the evidence in court of justice. After the first collision has been found, many cryptanalysts have tried to explore various methods to detect the collisions with shorter and efficient time.

As the development of information technology and the use of data that increasingly large, it will be a main factor that affects to the company's business. The amount of data that must be processed both at headquarters and other branch offices make the process of data exchange become the main issue in term of speed and delay. Due to data exchange being a top priority in the company, often the WAN network bandwidth used by the file system, email system, proxy, web system becomes peak or full during peak hours thus slowing down accessing file or email system. One method to reduce bandwidth usage is almost full is to use WAN Optimization tools. WAN Optimization has several functions, including Data Streamlining, Transport Streamlining, and Application Streamlining. The purpose of this study is to analyze performance network when WAN optimization was applied in the system. Data is taken from simulated file transfers conducted several days and at different hours. Data were analyzed using Wireshark tools and calculation formula. The results can be seen if there is a significant increasing performance, delay become better from 287 ms to 0.604 ms for file size 93 MB and jitter increased 12.4% better. It can be concluded that with the optimization of WAN, the process of data transfer becomes more efficient both in bandwidth and time during working hours. © 2017 The Authors.

From the analysis, it can be concluded that HHT algorithm is more complex and slower than prony analysis algorithm. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Hilbert Huang Transform; Phasor Measurement; Prony Analysis; Response Time",,,,,,,"Phadke, A.G., (1993) IEEE Comput.

Many organizations failed to comply with the standard, and this eventually results in fines or even termination of the ability to process credit cards. Clearly, an evaluation mechanism or tool used to measure the current state of the organization's information security is needed. In this paper, an Information Security Maturity Model for PCI DSS (ISMM-PCI) with four maturity level - None, Initial, Basic and Capable - was proposed. The ISMM-PCI utilizes the use of quantitative and qualitative analysis, enhancing the PCI DSS to ISO/IEC 27001 mapping, and focuses on improving the quality of people, process and technology. The model assists the organizations to easily identify the key success factors and gaps (point of weaknesses), provides the guideline to better manage information security and formulate the best strategy for the enhancement, improving the overall information security state by selecting the best security countermeasures (controls) to protect their information assets from the emerging cyber-attacks, while achieving PCI DSS full compliant. The main advantage of ISMM-PCI over other ISMMs is its ease of use. The comparative analysis of the case results affirms the statement. ISMM-PCI may be used by a wide range of organizations regardless of the size. © 2016 IEEE.","compliance; compliant; ISO/IEC 27001; maturity; model; PCI; PCI DSS","Models; Security of data; Societies and institutions; compliance; compliant; ISO/IEC; maturity; PCI-DSS; Quality control",,,,,,"Alencar Rigon, E., Merkle Westphall, C., Dos Santos Ricardo, D., Becker Westphall, C., A cyclical evaluation model of information security maturity (2014) Information Management & Computer Security, 22 (3), pp. 265-278; Cherdantseva, Y., Hilton, J., A reference model of information assurance & security (2013) Availability, Reliability and Security (Ares), 2013 Eighth International Conference on, pp. 546-555. , September.

This way managing the manufacturing processes remotely through an Internet connection allows avoiding the direct influence of many negative phenomena affecting the environment, which become sometimes necessary in the ambient surrounding of the production facility. © Research India Publications.","Environment; Internet Connection; Management; Water Treatment",,,,,,,"Abbas, H.A., Mohamed, A.M., Review on the Design of Web Based SCADA Systems Based on OPC DA Protocol (2011) International Journal of Computer Networks (IJCN), 2 (6), pp. 266-277; Dobránsky, J., Baron, P., Vojnová, E., Manduľák, D., Optimization of the Production and Logistics Processes Based on Computer Simulation Tools (2016) Key Engineering Materials, 669, pp. 532-540; Chen, T.-C.T., Wang, Y.-C., Simulating a factory online using cloud computing and artificial neural networking (2014) International Journal of Internet Manufacturing and Services (IJIMS), 3 (4); Vishwajeet, H., Bhide, A., Survey on the Smart Homes using Internet of Things (IoT), International Journal of Advance Research in Computer Science and Management (2014) Studies, 2 (12), pp. 243-246; Lao, W., Han, J., With, P.H.D., Automatic videobased humanmotion analyzer for consumer surveillance system (2009) IEEE Trans Consum Electron, 55 (2), pp. 591-598; Piyare, R., Internet of Things: Ubiquitous Home Control and Monitoring System using Android based Smart Phone (2013) International Journal of Internet of Things, 2 (1), pp. 5-11","Antonyová, A.; Department of Mathematical Methods and Managerial Informatics, Slovakia",,,"Research India Publications",,,,,09734562,,,,"English","Int.

The most widely used car-following model is the Gazis-Herman-Rothery model, which contains two coefficients: m and l. The coefficients should be determined in calibration tests where the involved vehicles are tracked for their positions, velocities, and accelerations. The existing calibration methods are costly. This study proposes a calibration method using computer vision. Two computer vision algorithms are evaluated, namely, multilayer and Eigen background subtraction. The vehicle movement is tracked on a perspective plane and then is projected to an orthogonal plane. From the verification tests, we determine that the multilayer algorithm has 96.6% accuracy for the vehicle position and 88.9% for the velocity. The Eigen algorithm has 92.9% accuracy for the vehicle position and 84.3% for the velocity. The estimated model coefficients is 0.4 for m and 1.2 for l. These values are within the range of the most reliable coefficients according to many literatures. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.","Car-following model; Computer vision; Micro-simulation; Vehicle tracking","Calibration; Database systems; Multilayers; Tracking (position); Traffic control; Vehicles; Background subtraction; Car following models; Car-following modeling; Computer vision algorithms; Gazis-Herman-Rothery models; Microsimulation; Multilayer algorithms; Vehicle interactions; Computer vision",,,,,,"(2013), http://www.bps.go.id/linkTabelStatis/view/id/1413; Morichi, S., Long-term strategy for transport system in Asian megacities (2005) J.

In the FCD method, the traffic data are collected, manipulated, and transmitted by probe vehicles via a wireless network to a designated server where the data are stored, manipulated, and displayed in conjunction with a digital map. The method is capable to provide near real-time traffic data but its performance strongly and mainly depends on the reliability of the wireless network. In this work, the traffic data transmission strategy in the FCD method is discussed and its effect to the timeliness of the traffic data is described. As the results, it is found that when the data transmission strategy is not properly designed, a delay in a transmitted packet of data directly affects and intensifies the subsequent data transmission. We propose a transmission strategy to minimize the time delay and experimentally demonstrate that the strategy can reduce the time delay significantly. © 2015 IEEE.","Floating car data; intelligent transportation system; normal distribution; probe vehicle; virtual trip line","Data communication systems; Data transfer; Intelligent systems; Normal distribution; Probes; Time delay; Transportation; Vehicle locating systems; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicles; Wireless networks; Data transmission strategies; Floating car data; Information and Communication Technologies; Intelligent transportation systems; Near-real time; Probe vehicles; Transmission strategies; virtual trip line; Intelligent vehicle highway systems",,,,,,"Herrera, J.C., Work, D.B., Herring, R., Ban, X., Jacobson, Q., Bayen, A.M., Evaluation of traffic data obtained via GPS-enabled mobile phones: The mobile century field experiment (2010) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 18 (4), pp. 568-583. , http//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X09001430; Gunawan, F.E., Statistically optimum virtual trip line for real-time traffic monitoring system (2014) International Conference and Advanced Informatics: Concepts, T Heory and Applications (ICAlCTA), pp. 51-56. , Bandung, Indonesia, August 20-21,10. 1109IICAICTA. 2014. 7005914; Gunawan, F.E., Chandra, F.Y., Optimal averaging time for predicting traffic velocity using floating car data technique for advanced traveler information system (2014) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 138, pp. 566-575. , http//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/piilS1877042814041603, the 9th International Conference on Traffic and Transportation Studies (ICTTS 2014); Liu, K., Yamamoto, T., Morikawa, T., Feasibility of using taxi dispatch system as probes for collecting traffic information (2009) Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems, 13 (1), pp. 16-27; Uno, N., Kurauchi, F., Tamura, H., Lida, Y., Using bus probe data for analysis of travel time variability (2009) Intelligent Transportation Systems, 13 (1), pp. 2-15; Fabritiis, C.D., Ragona, R., Valenti, G., Traffic estimation and prediction based on real time floating car data (2008) 11th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems; Jeske, T., Floating car data from smartphones: What google and waze know about you and how hackers can control traffic (2013) Black Hat Conference, , Caesar PalaceLas Vegas, Nevada, July 27-August 1; Yim, Y., Cayford, R., Investigation of vehicles as probes using global positioning system and cellular phone tracking (2000) California PATH Program, , http//escholarship.org/uc/item/0378c1wc.pdf, Institute of Transportation Studies,University of California, Berkeley, California PATH Working Paper UCB-ITS-PW P-2001-9; Gunawan, F.E., Chandra, F.Y., (2014) Real-Time Traffic Monitoring System Using Floating Car Method, , http//www.amazon.comlReal-time-Traffic-Monitoring-System-Floating/dp/3659625175, Lambert Academic Publishing; Campolo, C., Lera, A., Molinaro, A., Paratore, S.Y., Ruggeri, G., Smartcar: An integrated smartphone-based platform to support traffic management applications (2012) First International Workshop on Vehicular Traffic Management for Smart Cities (VTM)",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","16th International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications, ISITIA 2015","20 May 2015 through 21 May 2015",,117126,,9781479977109,,,"English","Int.

Electro-flotation technology was used for cleaning of waste water contaminated with the disperse colorants. Dispersion colorants were used to decorate the boxes, made of corrugated board, in the company for the production of packaging. The objective of this paper is to present a method of optimization to determine the length of the time interval for electro-flotation process. Interval should be set so as to achieve the degree of cleaning the water that is the maximum possible in the process of electro-flotation. The measurement of the light passing through the measuring the translucent tube determines the actual degree of the water purity. The measurement is carried out by means of a photodiode in different wavelengths. The measured values in the measuring tube are compared with the nominal value, which corresponds to pure distilled water. Optimization the time interval to clean the water using electro-flotation was determined for yellow color. The optimum interval for the water contaminated with the yellow color was set to 1800s. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Flotation; Recycling; Water pollution; Water quality; Corrugated boards; Distilled water; Electro- flotation; Measured values; Nominal values; Recycling process; Sewerage networks; Water contamination; Water recycling",,,,,,"Allen, M., Preis, A., Iqbal, M., Srirangarajan, S., Lim, H.B., Girod, L., Whittle, A., Real-time in-network distribution system monitoring to improve operational efficiency (2011) (Journal American Water Works Association, 103, pp. 63-75; Bhandari, V., Abrol, P., Field Monitoring of Treated Industrial Waste Water (2013) (International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 3, pp. 629-634; Kaur, K., Mathur, N., Bhatnagar, P., Comparative Study of Usage of Microbial Strains for Monitoring Waste Water Treatment Plants (2012) Universal Journal of Environmental Research and Technology, 2, pp. 26-37; Klishchenko, P.E., Chebotareva, R.D., Goncharuk, V.V., Extraction of zinc from aqueous solutions by electrically polarized cation exchange fibers (2012) (Journal of Water Chemistry and Technology, 34 (6), pp. 253-257; Mesi, A., Kopliku, D., Toxicity Bio-Monitoring of Shkodra Lake Surface Water Using a Higher Plant Assay (2013) (Academic Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies, 2, pp. 133-140; Moxey, A., Agriculture and Water Quality: Monetary Costs and Benefits across OECD Countries OECD (2012) (Publishing Edinburgh), pp. 1-68; Svetleishaya, E.M., Mitchenko, T.E., Astrelin, I.M., Removal of natural organic matter by ultrafiltration (2014) (Journal of Water Chemistry and Technology, 36 (1), pp. 25-30; Voudouris, K., Voutsa, D., (2012) Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment, pp. 1-614. , (ed); Wang, N., Li, H., Long, J., Cai, Ch., Dai, J., Zhang, J., Wang, R., Contamination, source, and input route of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in historic wastewater-irrigated agricultural soils (2012) (Journal of Environmental Monitoring, 14 (12), pp. 3076-3085; Xu, L., Gu, H., Li, Ch., Shi, A., Shen, J., (2013) System Design of Water Quality Monitoring Robot with Automatic Navigation and Self-test Capability (International Journal of Control and Automation, 6, pp. 67-82",,"Gaol F.L.","","Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Science and Engineering in Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics,  ScieTech 2015","31 January 2015 through 1 February 2015",,113042,17426588,,,,"English","J.

Almost all wireless devices use the quartz crystal oscillator to generate stable frequency. To get good quality of quartz crystal oscillators, then it needs to be taken carefully from designing up to how to manufacture them. In this paper, we present the characteristic of quartz crystal oscillator and the factors that affect the frequency stability of quartz crystal oscillator. Knowing these factors to design crystal oscillator is essential. The characteristic of crystal oscillatorwill depend on thematerial purity, cutting angle, dimension, surface roughness and edges, thickness, material of electrode, and cleanliness. Crystal oscillator manufacturing process is very long, starting from row material angle marking, cutting, shaping, lapping, electrode evaporation, mounting, frequency adjusting, and aging. All these process will discuss in this paper, including the testing. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015",,,,,,,,"Ballato, A., Piezoelectricity: Old effects and new applications (1995) IEEE Ultrason.

Data were gathered by experimenting using accelerometer to find standby threshold and fall threshold. Data for standby threshold were processed by calculating all the differences and thus use the maximum difference for a threshold. Data for fall threshold were also processed by calculating all the differences and thus use the minimum difference from activities that were ended with a fall. Those thresholds were implemented into prototype application and tested again to find its accuracy. Results were 1 on sensitivity and 0.96 on specificity. It could be concluded that this fall detection algorithm has a 0.98 on its accuracy. © 2015 SERSC.","Accelerometer; Android; Fall detection algorithm; Medical alert system",,,,,,,"Wu, Y.C., A Mobile-Phone-Based Health Management System (2011) Master of Science Thesis, , Taiwan: National United University; Koshmak, G., An Android Based Monitoring and Alarm System for Patients with Chronic Obtrusive Disease (2011) International Master's Thesis, , Sweden: Orebro University; Zhou, F., Mobile Personal Health Care System for Patients with Diabetes (2011) Graduate Theses and Dissertations, , Ames, Iowa: Iowa State University; Munir, M.W., Tracking Devices for Elderly Care System by Using GPS and RF Tags (2009) Master of Science Thesis, , Finland: Tampere University of Technology; Gonzales, I.J.D., Fall Detection Using a Smartphone (2011) Master's Thesis in Media Technology, , Gjøvik: Gjøvik University College; Abatte, S., Avvenuti, M., Bonatesta, F., Cola, G., Corsini, P., Vecchio, A., A Smartphone Based Fall Detection System (2012) Pervasive Mobile Computer, 8, pp. 883-899; Connoly, T., Begg, C., Database Systems: A Practical Approach to Design (2009) Implementation, and Management, , 5th ed.

This work is important for a number of reasons: the increasing number of the Internet users across the globe, the increasing number of social media, increasing in the number and types of crime on the Internet, and the crime of sexual abuse in children impacts both physically and physiologically. Online grooming is the most reported suspected Internet activities in 2009-2010 according to Child Exploitation and Online Protection, which is a part of the UK's Home Office Serious Organized Crime agency. Around 160 online script conversations are analyzed to determine characteristics of a grooming conversation. Those scripts are obtained randomly from http://www.perverted-justice.com and www.literotika.com. The characteristics are divided into 20 types. The scripts are divided into two sets: 100 scripts for the training set and 59 scripts for the testing set. As the results, five most relevant grooming characteristics are identified from the paired t-test, and a logistic model is established on this basis. The model is evaluated using the testing data set, and the results show that the model has relatively good performance with 95% accuracy, 96% true positive, 4% false positive, 93% true negative, and 7% false negative. © 2015 The Authors.

Although the flotation has already been applied in several circumstances to purify the wastewater, the situation required to develop a specific system with optimum automation control and satisfactory entry requirements and operating costs. Another problem was production the proper air bubbles to associate with impurity components. If the air is blown into the contaminated water through a tube or a porous material, clogging can occur, as some oily parts of the colorants may agglomerate at the holes. The article presents electro-flotation as a new way for production the bubbles in the form of molecules of hydrogen and oxygen which are created using electrodes in meandered shape. These bubbles can easily float to the surface of the waste water in the flotation tank and be linked there to molecules of impurities during the process. The bubbles clump together to form foam at the surface. The foam is then skimmed periodically as a highly concentrated waste. Water purification process is analyzed and experimentally optimized before its implementation. Overall flotation process shows 98% purity of the final water treatment, while the process is conducted at pH of 5.5 acidity of the medium. The whole process is controlled with a specific system with the microprocessor that was programmed for this purpose. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

At the moment we have an accident that we may be difficult, even we cannot contact police or rescue ambulance. In addition we do not know their phone number or perhaps circumstances we were so severe that we cannot dial the rescue or police phone number. In this paper, we introduce a system that can generate alerts or contact rescuers and police automatically when we are faced with a situation that is undesirable. The system will utilize the accelerometer sensor in the mobile devices (smart phone). We proposed fall detection algorithm which use accelerometer to generate a signal.

The problem is that the gap and its surrounding is full of the disperse glue and the distance of the rolls as one of the gap characteristics predetermines the amount of the glue that is applied to the paper during the box production. Precise setting the distance that is based on accurate measuring is not possible during the process using the previous mechanism. Therefore electronic measuring devices were applied using the magnetic rotary encoders on both ends of the rolls. Magnetic rotary encoder enables to detect the accurate real position of the rolls at any moment of the process. The processor, as a part of the electronic device, was programmed in assembler to read the values from the sensor MAB28, to recalculate the values into the real size of the gap between the rollers and send the data to be expressed on LCD. The data received using the measuring technique is expressed in the graph. Statistical methods prove the linearity of the mutual dependency that means continuous and accurate method for displaying of the setting options. © 2014 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Control; Electronic circuit module; Rotary encoder",,,,,,,"Antonyová, A., Antony, P., (2014) Adv.

Some network hops may be needed to send a packet from one node to another node in the MANET. To do the communication between the nodes, a route has to be selected in the network, therefore it need a routing protocol that manage selection of the route. Selection route in mobile ad-hoc network is not easy because nodes always move so that the topology of network always changed every time. This is a big issue in selection route in mobile ad-hoc network because the route can be broken anytime. Moreover, MANET is more vulnerable than other wireless communication types because every mobile node serves as both the host and the router and forwards packets on behalf of each other. This study presents the analyzing and evaluation several routing algorithms and a novel scheme to build an authentication system by adding the modified zero knowledge proof algorithm to each mobile node in MANET. © 2014 B.

The goal of modeling them is to analyze and calculate meaning of the level of security in the cyber world. Analyzing and calculating was done by the quantitative method, so that the investment decision in security tools were expected to be objective, which were based on performance and situational experiences in an organization. Risk management was then associated with the calculation of costs that may occur with the point of view of the financial aspects of ROI/CBA, such as NPV, IRR, and ROI, so it can be measured in the level of security of the organization and can be maintained within a certain period. Our model consisted sixteen formulas that can show the increasing level of security based on the cost. © 2014 SERSC.","Asset identification; CIA; Network security; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security level","Investments; Risk assessment; Risk management; Asset identification; CIA; Financial aspects; Investment decisions; Quantitative method; Risk management models; Security level; Security tools; Network security",,,,,,"Reggiani, A., Network resilience for transport security: Some methodological considerations Transport Policy; Cho Kim, B., Wan Park, Y., Security versus convenience?

In the context of ever-changing threats, new attacks are constantly created, and new rules for identifying them are dramatically increasing. To adapt to these new rules, IDSs must be easily reconfigurable, they must keep up with line rates of network traffic, and they must have high detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a high-performance memory-based IDS that can be easily reconfigured for new rules. Our IDS achieves high performance and memory efficiency by utilizing deep packet pre-filtering and novel finite state encoding.

This comparison can be performed by a pattern matching engine which has several key requirements including scalability to line rates of network traffic and easy updating of new attack patterns. Memory-based deterministic finite automata meet these requirements, however their storage requirement will grow exponentially with the number of patterns which makes it impractical for implementation. In this paper, we propose a customized memory-based pattern matching engine, whose storage requirement linearly increases with the number of patterns. The basic idea is to allocate one memory slot for each state instead of each edge of the deterministic finite automaton. To demonstrate this idea, we have developed two customized memory decoders. We evaluate them by comparing with a traditional approach in terms of programmability and resource requirements.

This article presents a novel pattern-matching engine that exploits a memory-based, programmable state machine to achieve deterministic processing rates that are independent of packet and pattern characteristics. Our engine is a self-addressable memory-based finite state machine (SAMFSM), whose current state coding exhibits all its possible next states. Moreover, it is fully reconfigurable in that new attack patterns can be updated easily. A methodology was developed to program the memory and logic. Specifically, we merge ""non-equivalent"" states by introducing ""super characters"" on their inputs to further enhance memory efficiency without adding labels. SAM-FSM is one of the most storage-efficient machines and reduces the memory requirement by 60 times. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the validity of SAM-FSM. © 2009 IEEE.","Decoding; Detectors; Doped fiber amplifiers; Encoding; Engines; Hardware; Memory management","Attack patterns; Doped fiber amplifiers; Encoding; Finite-state machines; Incoming packets; Memory efficiencies; Memory management; Memory requirements; Network attacks; Novel patterns; Pattern characteristics; Processing rates; Re-configurable; State machines; Computer crime; Contour followers; Decoding; Encoding (symbols); Engines; Intrusion detection; Fiber amplifiers",,,,,,"Aho, A., Corasick, M., Efficient String Matching: An Aid to Bibliographic Search (1975) Commun.

A daunting challenge in the design of internet intrusion detection systems is how to perform high-speed string matching operations. This paper presents a string matching architecture, consisting of software based classifiers and hardware based verifiers. Based on incoming packet contents, the packet classifiers can dramatically reduce the number of strings to be matched and accordingly, feed the packet to a proper verifier to conduct matching. The paper presents the proposed classifier architecture and discusses the trade-offs in the classifier design. In addition, techniques, including multi-threading FSM, high-speed FSM interface circuits and interconnects for high-speed verifier implementation on FPGA platforms are discussed. Experimental results are presented to explore the trade-offs between system performance, strings partition granularity and hardware resource cost.

A daunting challenge in the design of this system is the requirement of simultaneous matching ofhundreds to thousands ofattack patterns at full wire speed. This paper presents a novel scheme to accelerate pattern matching by adding a prefilter to the exact pattern matching engines. This prefilter serves as a fast path for the majority incoming packets, which dramatically reduces the workload of exact pattern matching engines. Our prefilter checks each packet based on its header and content. To reduce matching complexity, the prefilter uses a much smaller set of representatives than the set ofpatterns. Our prefilter is false negative free, with a possible false positive rate, which can be reduced by increasing the representative length. Experiment results show that our prefilter has improved system throughput in the order of 100 times.","And system optimization; Intrusion detection system; Network security; Pattern matching; Signature recognition systems","And system optimization; Exact-pattern matching; False negatives; False positive rates; Fast paths; Incoming packets; Internet securities; Intrusion detection system; Packet-based; Pre-filtering; Prefilter; Signature recognition systems; System throughputs; Computer crime; Image coding; Internet; Intrusion detection; Network security; Pattern matching; Pattern recognition systems",,,,,,"Aho, A., Corasick, M., Efficient string matching: An aid to bibliographic search (1975) Communications of the ACM, 18; Aldwairi, M., Conte, T., Franzon, P., Configurable string matching hardware for speeding up intrusion detection (2005) SIGARCH Computer Architecture News, pp. 99-107; M.

A clear trend has been observed that more and more NPs employ multiple simple processors to run multiple packet processing applications in parallel. The key challenge for application developers is how to program NPs for high performance. This paper presents an automated task scheduling technique based on Simulated Annealing(SA). By incorporating tasks dependency into scheduling list, SA can quickly remove the invalid mappings and evolve to the high quality solutions. Particularly, a transition probability is defined to help converge, which is depending on system throughput and control parameter 'temperature'. Our mapping technique is able to take advantage of task-level and application-level parallelism to maximize system performance. The simulation results show that this proposed technique can generate high quality mapping comparing to other heuristics by mapping some sample network applications.","And Simulated Annealing; Application mapping; Embedded systems; Multiprocessors; Network processors","And Simulated Annealing; Application developers; Application mapping; Automated task scheduling; Control parameters; Flexible networks; High qualities; High-quality solutions; Mapping techniques; Multiprocessors; Network applications; Network processors; Packet processing; Simulation results; System throughputs; Transition probabilities; Annealing; Applications; Circuit theory; Control system analysis; Embedded systems; Integrated circuits; Multiprocessing systems; Scheduling; Simulated annealing",,,,,,"Austin, T.M., Sohi, G.S., Tetra: Evaluation of serial program performance on fine-grain parallel processors (1993), Technical Report 1163, Computer Science Department, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, July; (1999) C-5™ Digital Communications Processor, , http://www.cportcorp.com/solutions/docs/c5-brief.pdf, C-Port Corporation; Dai, J., Huang, B., Li, L., Harrison, L., Automatically partitioning packet processing applications for pipelined architectures (2005) SIGPLAN Not, 40 (6), pp. 237-248; EZchip Technologies Ltd., Yokneam, Israel.

One of the most promising ways to provide security is Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). The heart of almost every IDSs is a string matching algorithm, which is a very computational intensive task. Network Processors (NPs), a specialized multiprocessor, can provide flexibility and high performance for string matching. This paper evaluates several key string matching algorithms using a comprehensive simulation framework. Starting from a uniprocessor profiling, the framework constructs task graphs for string matching algorithms. Then task graphs are mapped onto NPs together with other network applications. The system throughput is determined by the analytical performance model. With this framework, we can evaluate the performance of different string matching algorithms on NPs. Our results show that shift table based algorithms (SFKSearch and Wu-Manber) and finite automaton based Aho-Corasick are complementary: SFKSearch and Wu-Manber do better job in NPs for good packet and larger pattern length due to better inter-task parallelism and shifting; Aho-Corasick does not depend on minimal pattern length and shows relative small processing cost variation between bad and good packets. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Aho-Corasick; Analytical performance model; International conferences; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network applications; Network processors; Pattern length; Simulation framework; String matching; String matching algorithms; System throughput; Task graphs; Task-parallelism; Uniprocessor; Computer applications; Computer crime; Computer systems; Graph theory; Indexing (of information); Intrusion detection; Multiprocessing systems; Sensors; Algorithms",,,,,,"PacGen - Ethernet IP TCP/UDP Packet Generator, , http://pacgen.sourceforge.net; Aho, A., Corasick, M., Efficient string matching: An aid to bibliographic search (1975) Communications of the ACM, 18; Baker, Z.K., Prasanna, V.K., Time and area efficient pattern matching on fpgas (2004) FPGA '04: Proceedings of the 2004 ACM/SIGDA 12th international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays, pp. 223-232. , New York, NY, USA, ACM Press; Boyer, R.S., Moore, J.S., A fast string searching algorithm (1977) Communication of the ACM, 20 (10), pp. 762-772; Bu, L., Chandy, J.A., Fpga based network intrusion detection using content addressable memories (2004) FCCM '04: Proceedings of the 12th Annual IEEE Symposium on FieldProgrammable Custom Computing Machines, pp. 316-317. , Washington, DC.

They are the key components to build a performance-scalable and function-flexible network systems. To meet the performance demands of increasing link speeds and more complex network applications, NPs are implemented with several dozen of processor cores and run multiple packet pmcessing applications in parallel. This trend makes it increasingly difficult for application developers to pmgram NPs for high performance. This paper presents an automated task scheduling technique to address this parallel programming complexity. Our proposed technique is based on GA. By incorporating tasks dependency into scheduling list and encoding task scheduling list as a chromosome, GA can quickly remove the invalid mappings and evolve to the high quality solutions. This technique takes advantage of task-level and application-level parallelism to maximize system performance for a given NPs architecture. The simulation results show that this pmposed technique can generate high quality mapping comparing to other heuristics by mapping some sample network applications. This work will also enable researchers and engineers to systematically evaluate and quantitatively understand the NPs system issues including application partitioning, architecture organizing, workload mapping and run-time operating. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Application developers; Application partitioning; Automated task scheduling; Complex networks; Data rates; High-quality; High-quality solutions; International conferences; Key components; Link speeds; Network applications; Network processors; Network systems; Processor cores; Programming complexity; Run-time; Simulation results; System issues; System performances; System-On-a-Chip; Task graphs; Task scheduling; Application specific integrated circuits; Bioelectric phenomena; Chlorine compounds; Circuit theory; Computer systems; Conformal mapping; Diesel engines; Embedded systems; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic programming; Integrated circuits; Microprocessor chips; Multitasking; Parallel programming; Program processors; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Computer applications",,,,,,"Austin, T.M., Sohi, G.S., Tetra: Evaluation of serial program performance on fine-grain parallel processors (1993), Technical Report 1163, Computer Science Department, University of Wisconsin, Madison.

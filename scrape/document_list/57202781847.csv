This study was developed based on a model of factors influencing consumer's intention to use e-payment, namely culture, perceived security, performance expectancy, effort expectancy and social influence. In conducting this study, the data is obtained from 110 respondents who used electronic transactions using e-payment. Meanwhile, the data collected was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). From the analysis, it is known that all these factors significantly influence the value of the use of e-payment. The sequence is based on a significant level of the greatest to the smallest are effort expectancy (0.346), culture (0.337), social influence (0.330), performance expectancy (0.272) and perceived security (0.166). © 2017 IEEE.","Customer's Intention; E-Business; E-Commerce; E-Payment; Model","Economic and social effects; Electronic commerce; Models; Customer's Intention; E-commerce transactions; E-payments; eBusiness; Electronic payment systems; Electronic transaction; Perceived securities; Structural equation modeling; Electronic money",,,,,"Shia, B.C., Chen, M., Ramdansyah, A.D., Wang, S., Emergence of payment systems in the age ofelectronic commerce: The state of (2015) Am.

In the FCD method, the traffic data are collected, manipulated, and transmitted by probe vehicles via a wireless network to a designated server where the data are stored, manipulated, and displayed in conjunction with a digital map. The method is capable to provide near real-time traffic data but its performance strongly and mainly depends on the reliability of the wireless network. In this work, the traffic data transmission strategy in the FCD method is discussed and its effect to the timeliness of the traffic data is described. As the results, it is found that when the data transmission strategy is not properly designed, a delay in a transmitted packet of data directly affects and intensifies the subsequent data transmission. We propose a transmission strategy to minimize the time delay and experimentally demonstrate that the strategy can reduce the time delay significantly. © 2015 IEEE.","Floating car data; intelligent transportation system; normal distribution; probe vehicle; virtual trip line","Data communication systems; Data transfer; Intelligent systems; Normal distribution; Probes; Time delay; Transportation; Vehicle locating systems; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicles; Wireless networks; Data transmission strategies; Floating car data; Information and Communication Technologies; Intelligent transportation systems; Near-real time; Probe vehicles; Transmission strategies; virtual trip line; Intelligent vehicle highway systems",,,,,"Herrera, J.C., Work, D.B., Herring, R., Ban, X., Jacobson, Q., Bayen, A.M., Evaluation of traffic data obtained via GPS-enabled mobile phones: The mobile century field experiment (2010) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 18 (4), pp. 568-583. , http//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X09001430; Gunawan, F.E., Statistically optimum virtual trip line for real-time traffic monitoring system (2014) International Conference and Advanced Informatics: Concepts, T Heory and Applications (ICAlCTA), pp. 51-56. , Bandung, Indonesia, August 20-21,10. 1109IICAICTA. 2014. 7005914; Gunawan, F.E., Chandra, F.Y., Optimal averaging time for predicting traffic velocity using floating car data technique for advanced traveler information system (2014) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 138, pp. 566-575. , http//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/piilS1877042814041603, the 9th International Conference on Traffic and Transportation Studies (ICTTS 2014); Liu, K., Yamamoto, T., Morikawa, T., Feasibility of using taxi dispatch system as probes for collecting traffic information (2009) Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems, 13 (1), pp. 16-27; Uno, N., Kurauchi, F., Tamura, H., Lida, Y., Using bus probe data for analysis of travel time variability (2009) Intelligent Transportation Systems, 13 (1), pp. 2-15; Fabritiis, C.D., Ragona, R., Valenti, G., Traffic estimation and prediction based on real time floating car data (2008) 11th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems; Jeske, T., Floating car data from smartphones: What google and waze know about you and how hackers can control traffic (2013) Black Hat Conference, , Caesar PalaceLas Vegas, Nevada, July 27-August 1; Yim, Y., Cayford, R., Investigation of vehicles as probes using global positioning system and cellular phone tracking (2000) California PATH Program, , http//escholarship.org/uc/item/0378c1wc.pdf, Institute of Transportation Studies,University of California, Berkeley, California PATH Working Paper UCB-ITS-PW P-2001-9; Gunawan, F.E., Chandra, F.Y., (2014) Real-Time Traffic Monitoring System Using Floating Car Method, , http//www.amazon.comlReal-time-Traffic-Monitoring-System-Floating/dp/3659625175, Lambert Academic Publishing; Campolo, C., Lera, A., Molinaro, A., Paratore, S.Y., Ruggeri, G., Smartcar: An integrated smartphone-based platform to support traffic management applications (2012) First International Workshop on Vehicular Traffic Management for Smart Cities (VTM)",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","16th International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications, ISITIA 2015","20 May 2015 through 21 May 2015",,117126,,9781479977109,,,"English","Int.

Science, Bina Nusantara University, Jl KH Syahdan 9, Jakarta, 11480, Indonesia","Despite the concern of privacy, the method of Floating Car Data (FCD) is clearly one of the cheapest methods to provide real-time or near real-time traffic information. The method has become more affordable with the proliferation of smart-phones and with the existing infrastructure of the wireless network. In conjunction with the virtual trip lines (VTL), the FCD method can mimic the traditional traffic monitoring method on the basis of loop detectors. In addition, the use of VTL also helps the FCD method in preventing the potential of tracking the probe vehicle, which is used to gather and report the traffic information. Although vast publications regarding the FCD method are available, the issues of the optimal length of the VTL, the timeliness of the data, and the accuracy of the geo-location data have not been discussed. This article focuses and addresses these issues empirically using data collected by a probe vehicle traveling along Jakarta Inner Road Highway in Jakarta, Indonesia. Those data are collected using ten smart-phones of the same type. As the result, the optimal trip line length can be established as a function of the level of accuracy of the geo-location data. In the case where the level of accuracy is 32 m, we determine a VTL length of 26 m should provide 95% chance that the probe vehicle will cross the line. In addition, the currently developed system can also provide about 80% of the traffic data in less than 1 min, and the remaining 20% data within 1-5 min interval. Finally, by applying a simple moving average filter, the prediction of the traffic velocity can be increased significantly, and the geo-location data error can be reduced up to 20%. © 2014 IEEE.","Advanced Traveler Information System; Floating Car Data; Global Positioning System; Intelligent Transportation Systems","Global positioning system; Intelligent systems; Probes; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Traffic control; Floating car data; Intelligent transportation systems; Moving average filter; Probe vehicles; Real-time traffic datum; Real-time traffic information; Traffic information; Traffic monitoring; Advanced traveler information systems",,,,,"Arnott, R., Does providing information to drivers reduce traffic congestion?

Building an efficient mass transportation system is clearly necessary. However, implementing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have also been demonstrated effective in various advanced countries. Recently, the floating vehicle technique (FVT), an ITS implementation, has become cost effective to provide real-time traffic information with proliferation of the smartphones. Although many publications have discussed various issues related to the technique, none of them elaborates the discrepancy of a single floating car data (FCD) and the associated fleet data. This work addresses the issue based on an analysis of Sugiyama et al's experimental data. The results indicate that there is an optimum averaging time interval such that the estimated velocity by the FVT reasonably representing the traffic velocity. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,"Morichi, S., (2005) Journal of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies, 6, p. 1; Nelson, J.D., Blundell, S., Pettitt, P., Thompson, S., (2001) Transport Review, 21, p. 51; Toshitaka, M., (2007) Japan ITS Handbook 2006-2007, , Highway industry development organization; Chen, K., Miles, J.C., (1999) ITS Handbook 2000: Recommendations from the World Road Association (PIARC), , Artech House; Sanwal, K.K., Walrand, J., (1995) California PATH Working Paper UCB-ITS-PWP-95-11, , Tech. rep., University of California, Berkeley; Cathey, F., Dailey, D., Transit vehicles as traffic probe sensors (2001) Proceedings IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems, pp. 579-584; Dai, X., Ferman, M., Roesser, R., A simulation evaluation of a real-time traffic information system using probe vehicles (2003) Intelligent Transportation Systems, 2003, Proceedings. 2003 IEEE, 1; Fabritiis, C.D., Ragona, R., Valenti, G., Traffic estimation and prediction based on real time floating car data (2008) 11th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems; Uno, N., Kurauchi, F., Tamura, H., Iida, Y., (2009) Intelligent Transportation Systems, 13 (2); Liu, K., Yamamoto, T., Morikawa, T., (2009) Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems, 13, p. 16; Herrera, J.C., Work, D.B., Herring, R., Ban, X., Jacobson, Q., Bayen, A.M., (2010) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 18, p. 568; Campolo, C., Iera, A., Molinaro, A., Paratore, S.Y., Ruggeri, G., SMaRTCaR: An integrated smartphone-based platform to support traffic management applications (2012) First International Workshop on Vehicular Traffic Management for Smart Cities (VTM); Jenelius, E., Koutsopoulos, H.N., (2013) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 53, p. 64; Rahmani, M., Koutsopoulos, H.N., (2013) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 30, p. 41; Sugiyama, Y., Fukui, M., Kikuchi, M., Hasebe, K., Nakayama, A., Nishinari, K., Ichi Tadaki, S., Yukawa, S., (2008) New Journal of Physics, 10, p. 033001; De Boor, C., (2001) A Practical Guide to Splines, , Springer Verlag; De Lillo, F., Cecconi, F., Lacorata, G., Vulpiani, A., (2008) EPL, 84; De Luca, L.T., (2009) Propulsion Physics, , (EDP Sciences, Les Ulis","Gunawan, F.E.; Bina Nusantara University, 11480 Jakarta, Indonesia; email: fgunawan@binus.edu",,"","EDP Sciences","2013 International Conference on Advances Science and Contemporary Engineering, ICASCE 2013","23 October 2013 through 24 October 2013","Jakarta",,21016275,,,,"English","EPJ Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901428304

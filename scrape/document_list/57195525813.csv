Syahdan No. 9, Kemanggisan, Palmerah, Jakarta, 11480, Indonesia","In Indonesia, especially Jakarta, many public facilities such as airports, train stations, bus stations are equipped with the Automatic External Defibrillators (AE-Ds). The effective use of these AEDs in public places by lay bystanders is important to improve the survival rate. Unfortunately, many people still have limited knowledge about AED and its critical function and lack of willingness to use the device. This research intends to measure the proportion of people in public places who have the knowledge concerning AED device and its use. The relevant data are collected by a survey on a random sample of 400 participants performed at the busiest railway station in Jakarta, Indonesia. The results suggest that almost 65% of them are unaware of the existence of the device in the public places. As many as 35% respondents do not recognize the device, and less than 35% respondents are willing to use the equipment. © 2018, ICIC International.

It is not only detrimental to the state, but also harm the perpetrators of theft of electricity and the surrounding communities. The purpose of this study is to create New Service Development (NSD) to provide a new electricity source for street vendors' activity based on their preferences. The methods applied in NSD is Conjoint Analysis, Cluster Analysis, Quality Function Deployment (QFD), Service Blueprint, Process Flow Diagrams and Quality Control Plan. The results of this study are the attributes and their importance in the new electricity's service based on street vendors' preferences as customers, customer segmentation, service design for new service, designing technical response, designing operational procedures, the quality control plan of any existing operational procedures. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cluster analysis; Crime; Electric utilities; Quality function deployment; Statistical methods; Customer segmentation; Electricity distribution; Electricity source; New service development; Operational procedures; Process flow diagrams; Quality function deployments (QFD); Service blueprint; Quality control",,,,,"Achilleas, B., Kostas, K., Exploring the Fuzzy Front-end of the New Service Development Process - A Conceptual Framework (2014) Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 148, pp. 348-353; Claret, Anna, Guerrero, Luis, Aguirre, Enaitz, Rincón, Carmen, Consumer preferences for sea fish using conjoint analysis: Exploratory study of the importance of country of origin, obtaining method, storage conditions and purchasing price (2012) Food Quality and Preference, 26, pp. 259-266; Jack, C., Lemuria, C., Social Media and Humanitarian Logistics: The Impact of Task-technology Fit on New Service Development (2015) Procedia Engineering, 107, pp. 412-416; Fitzsimmons, J.A., Fitzsimmons, M.J., (2006) Service Management Operation, Strategy, Information Technology, , (New York: McGraw-Hill); Spiros, G., Kalliopi, C., Achilleas, B., Helen, P., Unfolding the recipes for conflict resolution during the new service development effort (2016) Journal of Business Research, 69, pp. 4042-4055; Dieter, H., Saed, I., Van Husen Christian, Carsten, D., A New Approach for the Development of Services for Industrial Product-Service Systems (2016) Procedia CIRP, 47, pp. 353-357; Kim, K.J., Meiren, T., (2010) New Service Development Process, pp. 253-267. , Kim K.

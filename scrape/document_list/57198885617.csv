The measure of systemic risk is based on SRisk by Acharya et al. (2012) which is available in the NYU Stern V-Lab. XBRL is a dummy variable, in which 0 represents a pre XBRL adoption period (2007-2008) while 1 represents an XBRL reporting environment (2011-2012). It is further interacted with Corporate Governance, which is measured using an index developed by Brown & Caylor (2006). The result proves that XBRL do not significantly impact systemic risk of financial institutions listed in NYSE. The findings have been determined after having controlled firm size, capital ratio, leverage ratio and performance. © 2017 Australasian Accounting Business and Finance Journal and Authors.","Corporate Governance; Disclosure; Financial Institution; Market Discipline; NYSE; Risk Taking; Systemic Risk; XBRL",,,,,,"Acharya, V.V., Richardson, M., Causes of financial crisis (2009) Critical Review: A Journal of Politics and Society (195-210); Acharya, V., Engle, R., Richardson, M., Capital shortfall: A new approach to ranking and regulating systemic risks (2012) American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings, 102 (3), pp. 59-64; Angkinand, A.P., Wihlborg, C., Willett, T.D., (2011) Market Discipline for Financial Institutions and Markets for Information, , https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1886485, Research Handbook on International Banking and Governance, Forthcoming.

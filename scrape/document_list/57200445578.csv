The number of emarketplaces operating in Indonesia continues to increase over time. This condition makes the competition in e-marketplace business becomes more competitive. To survive, e-marketplace must be able to maintain and increase their number of customers. Basically, customers in the e-marketplace business are not just buyers, the sellers who market their goods and/or services in the e-marketplace are also customers of the e-marketplace. Some constraints experienced by the seller can cause the seller to leave the e-marketplace, this can be a serious threat for the e-marketplace that only acts as an intermediary. Although many studies have been conducted to determine the factors affecting buyer loyalty, but differences in objective and technical experience of buyers and sellers cause studies conducted on buyers can not be applied directly to sellers. Based on these backgrounds, then conducted research to find the factors that affect the loyalty of sellers in e-marketplace business. The research model was established and developed based on some previous research. Some factors such as efficiency, security and privacy, communication, reliability, information, value added services, image, cost, and promotion are examined to obtain answers to research objectives. The sample in this research is taken from the seller in e-marketplace in Indonesia. The method of analysis used in this research is Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results of this study found that the satisfaction, image, cost, promotion and value added services have a positive impact on the loyalty of the seller. Satisfaction is a factor that has the greatest influence on seller loyalty. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","E-commerce; E-marketplace; Factors; Seller loyalty; Structural equation modeling",,,,,,"Afuah, A., Tucci, C.L., (2001) Intenet Business Model and Strategies, , McGraw-Hill Higher Education; Arokiasamy, A.R., The impact of customer satisfaction on customer loyalty and intentions to switch in the banking sector in Malaysia (2013) The Journal of Commerce, 5 (1), pp. 14-21; Azizahwidyastuti, A., Hubungan Antara Kepuasan Konsumen Dengan Loyalitas Merek Pada Pengguna Kartu Prabayar Simpati (2013) Jurnal Psikologi, Fakultas Psikologi UIN Sultan Syarif Kasim Riau, 9 (1), pp. 1-8; Chen, J., Zhang, C., Xu, Y., The Role of Mutual Trust in Building Members' Loyalty to a C2C Platform Provider (2009) International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 14 (1), pp. 147-171; Daikh, J., (2015) A Research Proposal: The Relationship between Customer Satisfaction and Customer Loyalty, , MBA Student Scholarship.

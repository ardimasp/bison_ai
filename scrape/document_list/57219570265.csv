This study aims to determine and explain the influence of online shopping applications, hedonist habits, and online shop promotions activities on e-shopaholic behavioral intentions in women, especially those who have worked in the golden triangle area of Jakarta such as Kuningan, Thamrin, and Sudirman. This type of research is quantitative with sample of 101 women respondents using purposive random sampling. The results of this study indicate that there is an influence on the three variables mentioned above. The results found that the three aspects we mentioned as variables (online shopping applications, online shop promotions, and hedonist habits) contributed to increasing impulsive buying, such as shopaholic behavior specifically for women. The women's impulsive buying behavior influenced by an internal factor such as hedonist habits and external factors such as mobile applications and promotions. That made shopping desires more increased based on the regression analysis. The implication of our paper is an online shop must prioritize product information correctly so that a rational consumer community is formed in choosing and making online shopping a means of public education. © 2020 IEEE.","E-shopaholic behavior; Hedonist habits; Online shop promotions; Online shopping applications; Women shoppers","Information management; Behavioral intention; Buying behavior; Consumer communities; External factors; Internal factors; Mobile applications; Product information; Public education; Electronic commerce",,,,"Binus University","This paper is the result of an independent lecturer study involving students.

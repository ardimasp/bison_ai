This system is run to control waste and trash pollution at several areas along Malacca River. The objective of this work were to design an aesthetic solar panel as charging station for the RTCS and study the electrical output of solar cell use in the prototype. A bloomed flower shape of solar panel design was selected from four concept designs by Pugh Method. Five criteria were applied for the selection and the final concept was selected from concept model with highest score. Prototype of the selected model was fabricated by rapid prototyping method and sixteen commercially available solar cells with size of 65 mm×65 mm×3 mm were used for the prototype. Electrical output from single solar cell was examined to study the power output of the cell. It was found that single solar cell able to produce minimum electric power of 0.01 watt and maximum power of 0.353 watt. The power output of the solar cells was significantly affected by temperature of solar cell and increasing of relative humidity which consider to reduce sunlight intensity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Aesthetic Design; Solar Collector; Solar Energy","Pollution control; River pollution; Sports; Charging station; Collector systems; Concept designs; Concept model; Electric power; Electrical output; Solar panel design; Sunlight intensity; Solar cell arrays",,,,"Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka, UTeM: PJP/2017/FTK-AMC/S01562","The author would like to thank Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka for Applied Oriented Research grant (AORG) no PJP/2017/FTK-AMC/S01562.","Crawford, M., (2018) Making Solar Panels More Attractive, , https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/making-solar-panels-more-attractiven, April; Moss, D., Scheer, R., (2018) Solar Aesthetics: Rooftop Panels Never Looked so Good, , https://earthtalk.org/solar-aesthetics/, April; Siddiqui, R., Bajpai, U., Deviation in the performance of solar module under climatic parameter as ambient temperature and wind velocity in composite climate (2012) International Journal of Renewable Energy Research, 2, pp. 486-490; Bhattacharya, T., Chakraborty, A.K., Pal, K., Effects of Ambient Temperature and Wind Speed on Performance of Monocrystalline Solar Photovoltaic Module in Tripura, India (2014) Journal of Solar Energy, 2014; Ghazali, M.A., Rahman, A.M.A., The performance of Three different solar panels for solar electricity applying solar trackeing device under Malaysian Climate Condition (2012) Energy and Environment Research, 2 (1), pp. 235-243; Wu, W.H., Tung, S.W., Lin, H.W., (2009) Multi-leaf Solar Energy Supplying Apparatus; Clark, M., (2009) Adjustable Solar Power; Chu, R., (2011) Closable Solar Collector; Swatek, A., Stoger, E., Kaser, A., Prasent, M., (2015) Solar Module; Thakker, A., Jarvis, J., Buggy, M., Sahed, A., DCAD conceptual design of the next-generation impulse turbine using the Pugh decision-matrix Materials and Design, 30 (7), pp. 2676-2684; Panjwani, M.K., Narejo, G.B., Effect of Humidity on the Efficiency of Solar Cell (photovoltaic) (2014) International Journal of Engineering Research and General Science, 2, pp. 499-503; Kazem, H.A., Chaichan, M.T., Effect of Humidity on Photovoltaic Performance Based on Experimental Study (2015) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 10, pp. 43572-43577; Mekhilef, S., Saidur, R., Kamalisarvestani, M., Effect of dust, humidity and air velocity on efficiency of photovoltaic cells (2012) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 16 (5), pp. 2920-2925",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","2nd Joint International Conference on Emerging Computing Technology and Sports, JICETS 2019","25 November 2019 through 27 November 2019",,161273,17426588,,,,"English","J.

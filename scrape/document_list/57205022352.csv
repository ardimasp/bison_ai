Nowadays, many companies are turning to freelancing rather than hiring full-time employees. In addition, the workers have also switched to working as freelancers. New problems also arise in the crowdwork system. Trust is one of the main issues that arise in the crowdwork system. It happens because the job providers and workers do not meet each other on the crowdwork portal. This research aims to examine the components that affect trust in a crowdwork system. The benefit is that stakeholders can be aware of how to increase trust in the crowdwork system. The method used in this research is systematic literature review, by analyzing Scopus based journals related to trust in the crowdwork system. This research produces 11 components and 38 indicators. There are three components that needs concern to stakeholders who want to take advantage of crowdwork systems and focus on trust. These components are reciprocal voting, monetary reward, and cognitive effort. The platform should enable stakeholders to have reciprocal voting, less cognitive effort, as well as clean and clear monetary reward procedure. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

The object used in this research is trouble ticket system in telecommunications infrastructure provider. The goals of IT Management of Trouble Ticket System on information security are having ISO/ IEC 27001 certification and structured governance that provides not only the details of the processes involved in each area focusing on effectiveness and efficiency, but also insights into how business practices can produce sustainable results. It is therefore necessary to analyze IT governance, especially for information security. The maturity level will analyze the difference between the company's performance objectives and the company's current capabilities. COBIT 5 combined with CMMI used to analyze the information security of trouble ticket system. Interview and questionnaire were also used in this research. The analysis results show that the target capacity level for the 5 domains is 3. The results of the obtained assessments on EDM03, APO12 and BAI06 are 0, which means the process is incomplete. The value of APO13 capacity is 1 (Process executed) and the value of the capacity DSS05 is 3 (Process established), but not completely reached. There is a difference in the target and current level of capacity that underpins the author to propose recommendations, such as complete the output (work products) at level 1 and generic practices at level 2 and 3. © 2019 IEEE.","capability level; CMMI; COBIT 5; information security; trouble ticket system","Security of data; Surveys; capability level; CMMI; COBIT 5; Customer complaints; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Performance objective; Telecommunications infrastructures; Trouble ticket; Information management",,,,,,"Pham, H.C., Information security burnout: Identification of sources and mitigating factors from security demands and resoources (2019) Journl of Information Security and Applications, pp. 96-107; Kruger, H., Flowerday, S., Drevin, L., Steyn, T., An assessment of the role of cultural factors in information security awareness (2011) Information Security South Africa (ISSA), pp. 1-7; Kim, A.C., Lee, S.M., Lee, D.H., Compliance Risk Assessment Measures of Financial Information Security using System Dynamics (2012) International Journal of Security and Its Applications, 6, pp. 191-200; Waly, N., Organisational information security management: The impact of training and awareness (2013) Evaluating the Socio-technical Impact on Organisational Information Security Policy Management; Merhi, M.I., Ahluwalia, P., Examining the impact of deterrence factors and norms on resistance to information systems security (2018) Computers in Human Behavior; Steinbart, P.J., Raschke, R.L., Gal, G., Dilla, W.N., The influence of a good relationship between the internal audit and information security functions on information security outcomes (2018) Accounting, Organization and Society, pp. 1-15; Hassanzadeh, M., Jahangiri, N., Brewster, B., A conceptual framework for information security awareness, assessment, and training (2014) A Conceptual Framework for Information Security Awareness, Assessment, and Training, pp. 99-109. , In M.

Currently, education has reached the Education 4.0 stage. Education 4.0 requires technological commitment. Learning processes focus on students, not the teacher as in the previous educational system. Learning processes involve other stakeholders such as the industries, the communities, the experts, or the government. Smart Hybrid Learning Method is a learning method that responds to the Education 4.0 system, which is possible to create collaboration among stakeholders. The purpose of this research is to produce a model of Smart Hybrid Learning Method and architectural framework design of Smart Hybrid Learning System using three-layer architecture approach. The Smart Hybrid Learning Method is the evolution of the flipped or inverted classroom method combined with several other learning method approaches, such as Challenge Based Learning and Case Based Learning. Learning can be done inside and outside the classroom. To apply the Smart Hybrid Learning Method, it needs system called Smart Hybrid Learning System, which can be accessed by several stakeholders. The use of three-layer architecture will create flexibility to function and layer in the system. © 2018 IEEE.","education 4.0; smart education; smart hybrid learning framework; smart learning; three-layer architecture","Computer architecture; Unsupervised learning; Architectural frameworks; Case based learning; Challenge-based learning; Educational systems; Hybrid learning; Hybrid learning methods; smart learning; Threelayer architecture; Education computing",,,,,,"Cole, J.E., Kritzer, J.B., Strategies for success: Teaching an online course (2009) Rural Special Education Quarterly, 28 (4), pp. 36-40; Gallagher, K., (2009) LOEX Conference Proceedings 2007: From Guest Lecturer to Assignment Consultant: Exploring A New Role for the Teaching Librarian, , Ypsilanti, MI: Eastern Michigan University; Gannod, G.C., Burge, J.E., Helmick, M.T., (2008) Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Software Engineering: Using the Inverted Classroom to Teach Software Engineering, , New York, NY: ACM; Hakeem, Hamami, Proposed flip teaching framework based on multi-tier architecture (2015) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science and Software Engineering, 5 (6); Jhingan, A., (2017) Leapfrogging to Education 4. 0: Student at the Core, , Ernst & Young.

Evaluation to set a target of each source of tax / levy is done by selecting one of the alternative-existing targets, taking into account the existing support information. If the choice between alternative targets no deemed appropriate, the user can enter a new unit rates for alternative change optimistic targets to be selected. Each tax sources was classified by type of tax / levy or by a particular work unit manager. And then, total realization, an alternative target, and the target of choice of the type of tax / levy or work unit will be identified.

Major research questions pursued were: What is the influence of entrepreneurial process on the green business environment concept? What is the influence of cost effectiveness of membrane-based technology of the water system on the green business environment concept? What is the influence of entrepreneurial process on the sustainable competitive advantage of a pharmaceutical firm? What is the influence of cost effectiveness of membrane-based technology in a water system on the sustainable competitive advantage in a pharmaceutical firm? What is the influence of a green business environment concept on sustainable competitive advantage for a pharmaceutical firm? The research was conducted from a sample of 206 pharmaceutical member-firms of the Indonesian Pharmaceutical Association (GP FARMASI). The result of this research verified that the entrepreneurial process has a significant positive influence on the green business environment and sustainable competitive advantage. Furthermore, cost effectiveness also has significant positive influence on green business environment but has no significant influence on sustainable competitive advantage. Therefore, cost effectiveness and the entrepreneurial process membrane-based technology was suggested as an effective strategy to create a green business environment and achieve sustainable competitive advantage in the pharmaceutical industry. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt.

Customers are viewed as the object of firms' organizational activities to provide benefits for the company. The researcher broadens this view into a bigger perspective, where the customers are now not only becoming the objects, but also the subjects of the organizational activities. The purchase intention must move on to the next level where all actors in organizational activities are taking charge in delivering purchase intention. Human-to-human interaction has become so important in organizational activities that firms must articulate on these factors to complement the existing factors, especially during the Industry 4.0. This research uses a quantitative analysis with 91 respondents aged between 18 to 55 years old with income. The data analysis uses SPSS AMOS. The findings correlate with the newest Consumer Trend Report for 2020 and more that in the future, social interaction between humans takes a great deal in making purchase decisions, known as consumer conformity. Innovations must be done by gaining consumer insights and increasing social roles to the advantages of the firms through social comparison, image related concerns and strategic complements. This research has several limitations. First, data collection was based on convenience sampling and the second, the ideal number of respondents should be 385 based on Cochran's sampling method calculation. Future research should address these two issues. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt. Ltd.

Specifically, IT has made significant and major changes in banking industry, especially on the way people do business with bank. Beside as business enabler, IT now become a major tool for bank to win the competition. With the strategic role of IT in banking industry, there is a risk from security point of view. The new sophisticated and advanced kind of attack drive to higher impact for banks. Beside direct loss caused by successful attack, there is also loss caused by image damage and sanction from regulatory. With many initiatives can be done to improve Information Security condition, banking need to prioritize the initiative that has most significant impact. Management support on information security is cited by many literatures as basic requirement for improving Information Security condition. Security Operation Center also proposed as initiatives to enhance the capability of detection and response to attack. This research tries to empirically find out the impact of Management Support to information security performance and the role of Security Operation Center on mediating both variables. Data are gathered from banks in Indonesia using survey methodology through questionnaire answered by qualified respondents. The sample design used is a probability sample with disproportionate stratified random sampling and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Square. This paper shows that management support has significant impact on improving Information Security condition in banking industry. It also concludes that SOC has complimentary mediation of relationship between management support and information security performance. Practically, result of this research can be foundation for company that wants to focus on factors that significantly impact security performance, while theoretically confirmed previous studies on the role of management support. © BEIESP.","Banking Industry; Information Security Performance; Management Support; Security Operation Center; SEM-PLS",,,,,,"King, B., (2012) Bank 3.0: Why Banking is No Longer Somewhere You Go but Something You Do, , 1st ed.

However, currently, there is lack of studies to understand the role of digital technology and entrepreneur orientation on influencing the performance of SME’s in Indonesia. This study aims to develop a conceptual model linking entrepreneurial orientation, digital technology capability and SME performance. This study is using Systematic literature review (SLR) method. The result of SLR was used as the based for the concept development. More than 1100 publication published from 2010 to 2019 were screened with entrepreneurial orientation, digital technology and SMEs’ performance as keywords. Finally, 34 journals were included for this review. Based on the review there were three possible relationships in the conceptual model which are (1) there is a positive relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and firm performance; (2) there is a positive relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and digital technology capability and (3) there is a positive relationship between digital technology capability and firm performance. It concludes with the need for further study to find empirical validation of the three relationships. Contribution of this study is giving the conceptual framework that both entrepreneurial orientation and digital technology capability might have important roles to SMEs’ performance in Indonesia. © 2019, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication.

Unfortunately, many of these small businesses cannot survive for long. In Indonesia alone, a three and a half year survival rate is set by the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) (KUKM) for someone to be called an entrepreneur. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of financial performance and service and product innovation on the survival of small businesses mediated by TAM. The method of this research is a quantitative approach using SEM Lisrel. The sample of this research is food and beverage SMEs in Jabotabek by selecting purposive samples obtained from 200 respondents. The results of this study are based on the results of the analysis and discussion found that the variable Financial Performance proved to have a positive effect on Business Survival. Variable Service and Product Innovations proved to have a positive effect on Survival Enterprises and TAM has a moderate effect on the performance of finance and product innovation and services to survive SMEs. © 2019, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Financial performance; Product innovation; Survive SMEs; TAM",,,,,,"Aas, T.H., Pedersen, P.E., The impact of service innovation on firm-level financial performance (2011) The Service Industries Journal, 31 (13), pp. 2071-2090; Aldas-Manzano, J., Küster, I., Vila, N., Market orientation and innovation: An interrelationship analysis (2005) European Journal of Innovation Management, 8 (4), pp. 437-452; Arikunto, S., (2006) Suhardjono, dan Supardi, , (2006), Penelitian tindakan kelas; Baker, W.E., Sinkula, J.M., The complementary effects of market orientation and entrepreneurial orientation on profitability in small businesses (2009) Journal of small business management, 47 (4), pp. 443-464; Barbosa, E., (2016) Determinants of Small Business Survival: The Case of Very Small Enterprises of the Traditional Manufacturing Sectors in Brazil, , Available at SSRN 2802706; Bettencourt, L.A., Brown, S.W., Sirianni, N.J., The secret to true service innovation (2013) Business Horizons, 56 (1), pp. 13-22; Borrego, M., Douglas, E.P., Amelink, C.T., Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed research methods in engineering education (2009) Journal of Engineering education, 98 (1), pp. 53-66; Cai, Y., Cude, B.J., (2008) Online shopping, pp. 137-159. , In Handbook of consumer finance research.

As of today, 383 of Regional Government Water Supply Companies in Indonesia, known as Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum (PDAM), are underperforming with only 36% of urban service coverage or 22,40% of national service coverage in average. This paper aims at examining the effect of the latent variables of strategic entrepreneurship, dynamic capabilities, and government policies to PDAM performance. The novelty of this research is the role of government policy as a moderating variable in the relationship between strategic entrepreneurship and dynamic capabilities as they relate to PDAM performance. The methodology used in this research is the quantitative method conducted through a descriptive and explanatory survey. The number of the sample is 120 respondents. Further data were analyzed using the SEM-PLS method with SmartPLS software. This research proved that dynamic capabilities influence PDAM performance, and indicate the need for a stronger government policy, one that would influence strategic entrepreneurship and dynamic capabilities relate to PDAM performance. These findings are intended to contribute to development of strategic management theory and a managerial implication, specifically that PDAM should apply strategic management for the improvement of their performance in order to actively participate in government programs for drinking water services. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

When changes happen, employees need to adapt to the work environment and this can influence many aspects of employees’ working life. The performance of employees will influence the performance of an organisation and one of the factors that influences employee performance is employee motivation. The changes can be through communication and culture differences. Television broadcasting service companies must focus on their human resource because they employ a large number of workers. There are 19 major television companies in Indonesia. The broadcasting industry is one of the pioneers of private television stations in Indonesia. Media Citra Nusantara owns RCTI, Global TV and iNews TV. The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of organisational communication and organisational culture on employee motivation and its impact on employee performance in the broadcasting industry. The method of data collection used in this study is the questionnaire. Questionnaires were distributed to 300 employees. The data analysis method used in this study is path analysis. The results of this study shows that organisational culture does not influence employee performance, while organisational communication and employee motivation influence employee performance. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Employee motivation; Employee performance; Organisational communication; Organisational culture; Path analysis",,,,,,"Azar, M., Shafighi, A.A., The effect of work motivation on employees’ job (2013) International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences, 3 (9), pp. 1-9; Bhatia, K., Balani, M., Effective internal communication: A crucial factor affecting employee performance (2015) Proceedings of International Conference on Management, Economics and Social Sciences, , Dubai; Browaeys, M.J., Price, R., (2011) Understanding Cross-Culture Management, , Ontario: Perason Education; Chaudhary, N., Sharma, D.B., Impact of employee motivation on performance (productivity) in private organization (2012) International Journal of Business Trends and Technology, 2 (4), pp. 29-35; Ganta, V.C., Motivation in the work place to improve employee performance (2014) International Journal of Engineering Technology, Management and Applied Science, 2 (6), pp. 221-230; Ghozali, I., (2011) Aplikasi Analisis Multivariate Dengan Program SPSS [Application of Multivariate Analysis Using The SPSS Programme], , Semarang: Badan Penerbit Universitas Diponegoro; Harris, T.E., Nelson, M.D., (2008) Applied Organizational Communication: Theory and Practice in A Global Environment, , New York: Lawrence Erlbaum; Iqbal, A., Ijaz, M., Latif, F., Mushtaq, H., Factors affecting employees’ performance: A case of the banking sector in Pakistan (2015) European Journal of Business and Social Science, 4 (8), pp. 309-318; Karki, J., Types of business communication (2012) Business Communication, , jb-karki.blogspot.com/2012/02/types-of-business-communication.html?m=1; Locker, K., Kaczmarek, S., (2010) Business Communication: Building Critical Skills, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Neves, P., Eisenberger, R., Management communication and employee (2012) Human Performance, 25 (5), pp. 452-464; Rajhans, K., Effective organizational communication: A key to employee motivation and performance (2012) Interscience Management Review, 2 (2), pp. 81-85; Ramadanty, S., Martinus, H., Organizational communication and motication in the work place (2016) HUMANIORA, 7 (1), pp. 77-86; Rounok, N., Parvin, M.M., Fostering employee performance: A literature review (2011) Industrial Engineering Letters, 1 (3), pp. 1-9; Sekaran, U., Bougie, R., (2013) Research Methods for Business, , West Sussex, UK: John Wiley & Sons; Simamora, B.H., Leadership for performance excellence (2013) International Business Management, 7 (4), pp. 247-257; Simamora, B.H., Marsellinus, J., Hartono, H., Strategy alignment with organizational culture assessment instrument (OCAI) results of cellular industry in Indonesia (2016) International Journal of Economics and Management, 10 (S1), pp. 81-93; Sugiyono, (2013) Statistika Untuk Penelitian [Statistics for Research], , Bandung: Alfabeta; Tabanchnick, B.G., Fidell, L.S., (2014) Using Multivariate Statistic, , (6th ed.).

It also aimed to examine the relationship between EO and student inclination toward entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional survey was conducted targeting students at Indonesian universities. Using a pilot sample of 65 students, the authors developed their hypotheses. Thereafter, based on a sample of 381 students, the hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. Findings - The findings revealed that EO in the Indonesian context was a three- factor instrument consisting of the three dimensions: risk-taking, innovativeness and proactiveness. Moreover, the findings showed there is a positive relationship between EO and Entrepreneurial Intention (EI) among business students at Indonesian universities. Practical implications - Given the imperative need for universities to monitor and improve the entrepreneurial spirit among business students, this study can help business students to understand better regarding the business attitude they need to maintain, which can help them to improve proactive personality and formulate effective business strategies in the future. Originality/value - This paper came to be one of the first studies that attempted to assess the EO among business student in Indonesia using AMOS-SEM. Additionally, this study pioneered through drawing a factorial picture for EO in the Indonesian context.","Business studentsr; Entrepreneurial intention; Entrepreneurial orientation; Structural equation modeling",,,,,,"Amrullah, A., (2012) Mayoritas Lulusan Perguruan Tinggi tak Tertarik Jadi Wirausahawan, Kok Bisa?, , http://www.republika.co.id/berita/nasional/umum/12/03/03/m0aira-mayoritas-lulusan-perguruan-tinggi-tak-tertarik-jadi-wirausahawan-kok-bisa, Accessed 13 May 2015; (2015) Jumlah pengangguran terbuka Indonesia 7,24 juta, , http://nasional.kontan.co.id/news/jumlah-pengangguran-terbuka-indonesia-724-juta, Accessed 13 May 2015; (2015) Jumlah Pengusaha Indonesia Hanya 1,65 Persen, , http://www.republika.co.id/berita/nasional/umum/15/03/12/nl3i58-jumlah-pengusaha-indonesia-hanya-165-persen, Accessed 13 May 2015; (2013) Sekjen Kemenakertrans Muchtar LuthfiMembuka Forum Inkubator Bisnis Asia Pasific di Bandung, , http://bbppk-lembang.com/view_news_detail-152-sekjen-kemenakertrans-muchtar-luthfi-membuka-forum-inkubator-bisnis-asia-pasific-di-bandung.aspx, Accessed 25 May 2015; Astuti, D.A.W., (2009) Pengaruh Konteks Keluarga, Kerja, Pendidikan, Hambatan Dalam Memulai Bisnis, Dukungan Sosial, Nilai-Nilai Individualisme dan Kolektivisme Pada Intensi Berwirausaha, , working paper, Management Department, Universitas Sebelas Maret, 19 October; Begley, T.M., Boyd, D.P., Psychological Characteristics Associated with Performance in Entrepreneurial Firms and Smaller Businesses (1987) Journal of Business Venturing, 2 (1), pp. 79-93; Bentler, P., Comparative fit indexes in structural models (1990) Psychological Bulletin, 107 (2), pp. 238-246; Bentler, P., (2005) EQS 6 Structural Equations Program Manual, , Multivariate Software, Encino, CA; Bentler, P.M., Bonett, D.G., Significance tests and goodness of fit in the analysis of covariance structures (1980) Psychological Bulletin, 88 (3), pp. 588-606; Bolton, D.L., Lane, M.D., Individual entrepreneurial orientation: development of a measurement instrument (2012) Education + Training, 54 (2-3), pp. 219-233; Brislin, R.W., Translation and content analysis of oral and written materials (1980) Triandis: Handbook of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 2. , J.

This shows the low use of SFA by the SF. This paper is aimed to evaluate SFA implementation by using Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use Technology (UTAUT) model approach. The results have obtained that effort expectancy variables have positive significant influence on behavioral intention and facilitating conditions have positive significant influence on the use behavior.

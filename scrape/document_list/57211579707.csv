Credit risk is an investor’s risk of loss arising from a borrower who fails to pay as promised resulting unfulfilled debt payment responsibility. The decision to give credit to a customer is performed by credit scoring models tools that constructed using several method of classifying data. In this study researchers will assess the ability of the model Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in predicting customer risk. Number of samples was 327 and 21 variables were used to identify good customers from bad customers. From the result of this research, success rate of the ANN model is 81.30% with Root Means square error 0.4330. ANN prediction method has the ability to solve the problem of on non-linearity through the learning process and the formation of patterns in the data that cannot be done by other statistical models. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

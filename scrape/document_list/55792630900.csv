Travelers create the itinerary before they are travelling to an area. However, creating itinerary is not easy, many factors need to be considered before deciding where to go, such as the “must visited” places in that area, distance between tourist attractions to be visited within a day, preferred tourist attractions, and other information about the places. Generating the optimized distance itinerary is similar as a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The purpose of this research is to study the combination of simulated annealing and Greedy algorithms to create an itinerary. The initialization process of the simulated annealing algorithm uses Greedy algorithm searching technique and then proceeded with existing optimization step in simulated annealing method. This paper proposed a method of enhanced simulated annealing algorithm and the experiment results show the enhanced simulated annealing increase the effectiveness of simulated annealing algorithm which produce the shortest distance needed to travel places around an area. © 2019 The Authors.

Noise is an unwanted component of the image. The existence of noise in a face image can degrade the accuracy of a face recognition. Therefore, we need a proper method that can cope noise or restore the quality of the image. The best method to overcome noise in the image is to use smoothing (filter). In this research, we discuss some techniques to overcome noise in face recognition task using Gabor and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), as it is stated in the previous research that it still cannot handle images with noise yet. The noises discussed in this research consist of impulse noise (salt-and-pepper), additive noise (Gaussian) and multiplicative noise (speckle). The experiment was conducted by using two face databases; they were ORL and Extended Yale B. The result said that mean filter is the best coping technique for Gabor and NMF face recognition methods. We used K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) as the classifier and it achieved 90.83% accuracy rate. © 2016 IEEE.","face recognition; filter; Gabor; NMF; noise","Additive noise; Factorization; Gabor filters; Impulse noise; Matrix algebra; Nearest neighbor search; Face recognition methods; filter; Gabor; Illumination effect; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Multiplicative noise; noise; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Face recognition",,,,,,"Olsson, T., Strengthening authentication with biometric technology (2003) GSEC Practical 1.4b, Option, 1. , August 26; Delac, K., Grgic, M., Bartlett, M.S., (2008) Recent Advances in Face Recognition, , Croatia: In-Tech; Purnomo, F., Suhartono, D., Shodiq, M., Susanto, A., Raharja, S., Kurniawan, R.W., Face recognition using Gabor Wavelet and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (2015) SAI Intelligent Systems Conference (IntelliSys), pp. 788-792. , IEEE, November; Rani, V., A brief study of various noise model and filtering techniques (2013) Journal of Global Research in Computer Science, 4 (4), pp. 166-171; Boncelet, C., Image Noise Models (2005) Handbook of Image and Video Processing, , Alan C.

This task is intended to analyze the presence of a support relation between two sentences. To be able to identify relations between two sentences or arguments, one is obliged to understand the nuance brought by both sentences. Our models are modification of siamese network architectures, in which we replace the feature extractor into Long Short Term Memory and implement cosine distance as the energy function. Our models take a pair of sentences as their input and try to identify whether there is a support relation between those two sentences or not.The primary motivation of this research is to prove that a high degree of similarity between two sentences correlates to sentences supporting each other. This work will focus more on the modification of siamese network and the implementation of attention mechanism. Due to the difference in dataset setting, we cannot arbitrarily compare our results with the prior research results. Therefore, this work will not highlight the comparison between deep learning and traditional machine learning algorithm per se, but it will be more of an exploratory research. Our models are able to outperform the baseline score of accuracy with a margin of 17.33% (67.33%). By surpassing the baseline performance, we believe that our work can be a stepping stone for deep learning implementation in argumentation mining field. © 2017 The Authors.

Face recognition is an example of authentication by using biometrics. Face recognition requires specific methods to obtain face representation as its features. There are many methods which have been developed to get these unique features, such as PCA, LDA, ICA and hybrid methods like ICA and SVM, Gabor and ICA and many others. This research develops a hybrid method from Gabor Wavelet and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) because during conducting literature reviews, the combination of these methods has never been found.

The research objective is to implement an synchronization algorithm which is able to maintain consistency of data owned by different databases through web service, so that data is always up to date. In this study, the implementation will describe the difference of data synchronization algorithm between unidirectional synchronization with bidirectional synchronization in different device through Web Service so users can still use the same data although using a different device. The implementation also adding additional information called as a marker to decide whether the data is need to ignore or synchronized to another database. © 2015 The Authors.

It is intended to support and use technologies especially in the field of education for helping teachers to do presentation with ease. The program is developed by using a science field of computer vision, as well as additional libraries which are: FLTK, OpenGL, and OpenCV. In order to use this program, the presenters need to have a webcam and a projector. The webcam will be used to recognize the shape and the pattern of the presenters' hands. Furthermore, the program will send signals to the computers based on the recognized pattern. The result of this research is a program that can improve the teaching process of teaching/presentation. © 2015 The Authors.

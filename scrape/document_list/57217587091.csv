Smart School is one of the concepts of IoT and is also a solution for education for student monitoring problems. In this study, student monitoring is proposed using an IP-based CCTV system with the ability to detect and recognize people. With the support of the use of beacon chips as student identity, the system can simplify problems of face identification to face verification. The use of fingerprinting techniques is a general technique used to determine the position of objects when using beacon chips based on transmitter signals so that the position of a student's face can be determined based on the user's position. The face verification process is then carried out by combining fingerprinting techniques and facial recognition captured by CCTV cameras with a face comparison method of OpenFace. Experimental results show that the proposed system provides good accuracy on student monitoring for smart school applications. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

This recommendation also helps the consumer gets the preference object. One of the popular objects in the recommendation is anime film. In this case, we conduct research to recommend anime films based on ratings of previously watched films. Collaborative filtering is a technique that consists of calculating similarities, predictions, and recommendations. This study is taken from dataset Kaggle which consists of 73,516 users and 12,294 anime. A user's history will be matched with the whole user's history with alternating least squares (ALS) method. The anime will be recommended based on that results. This method is expected to help millions of users find the desired anime. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","anime; collaborative filtering; prediction; Recommendation technique","Collaborative filtering; Least squares approximations; Alternating least squares; Calculating similarities; Collaborative recommendation system; Recommender systems",,,,,"Vie, J.J., Yger, F., Lahfa, R., Clement, B., Cocchi, K., Chalumeau, T., Kashima, H., Using posters to recommend anime and mangas in a cold-start scenario (2017) IEEE 14th IAPR International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 3, pp. 21-26; Wang, X., Xu, Z., Xia, X., Mao, C., Computing user similarity by combining simrank++ and cosine similarities to improve collaborative filtering (2017) IEEE 14th Web Information Systems and Applications Conference (WISA), pp. 205-210; Dev, A.V., Mohan, A., Recommendation system for big data applications based on set similarity of user preferences (2016) IEEE International Conference on Next Generation Intelligent Systems (ICNGIS), pp. 1-6; Kumar, M., Yadav, D.K., Singh, A., Gupta, V.K., A movie recommender system: Movrec (2015) International Journal of Computer Applications, 124; Verstrepen, K., Goethals, B., Unifying nearest neighbors collaborative filtering (2014) Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pp. 177-184; Ma, S., Ahmad, Z., Arefin, M.S., Hossain, M.R., A user rating-based collaborative filtering approach to predict movie preferences (2017) IEEE 3rd International Conference on Electrical Information and Communication Technology (EICT), pp. 1-5; Wu, C.M., Garg, D., Bhandary, U., A Collaborative Filtering Recommender System with Randomized Learning Rate and Regularized Parameter (2018) IEEE 9th Int.

When the IT service management system (SMS) and an information security management system (ISMS) are implemented separately, it can lead to consuming high resources and costly. This paper is going to focus on the integration of ISO 20001 as SMS standard, ITIL v3 as the framework, and ISO 27001 as ISMS standard. We are going to discuss how the ITIL V3 can be combined with ISO 20001 and ISO 27001 by scientifically matching the similarities of process, procedure, and resources. This paper contributes to providing a guideline for an IT organization that is going to implement SMS and ISMS standard and framework. In the Appendix section 4, we also provide a table of process, procedures, and resources similarities. Therefore, the organization can use the combined processes in order to reduce the cost of implementing those standards. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

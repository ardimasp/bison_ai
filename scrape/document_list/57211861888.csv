Some countries have implement e-voting and two of them are more populated than Indonesia. E-voting can make voting process and vote distribution better. In this paper we proposed IT infrastructure for e-voting using load balancing, cryptography, and block chain. Also this proposed model can be discussed further about application and system replication to produce similar data from all servers. © BEIESP.","E-voting; Infrastructure; Security; System",,,,,,"Kpu-Portal Publikasi Pemilihan Umum 2019, , https://infopemilu.kpu.go.id/; https://www.census.gov/popclock/world/id, [Online], [Accessed: 19-May-2018]; Gritzalis, D., Secure Electronic Voting: New trends, new threats, new options (2002) 7Th Comput.

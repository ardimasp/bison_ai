XYZ realizes that knowledge is one of the truly valuable asset for the company. Therefore, PT. XYZ wants to build knowledge repository system as a tool to support the knowledge capture process and management, also the knowledge sharing between employees. The purpose of this writing is to design a knowledge repository system at PT. XYZ so we can recommend the concept and design of knowledge repository system that will be developed in the future. Design methods used here are data collection method from interview, literature study, and also system analysis and design method based on object according to Bennett. Results to be achieved are the concept and design, also the prototype of knowledge repository system. From this writing we can summarize that with the automated storage and search structure, it is expected to bring ease for the employees in searching the required knowledge. This recommendation of storage system is useful to keep all knowledge from every PT. XYZ employee. Nevertheless, the content management is required to ensure the accuracy of the stored knowledge. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

Until now the problem of congestion has not been resolved properly because the number of vehicles is always increase and the number of roads is inadequate, drivers are not getting complete and updated information about the traffic around them, other than that the parties are also less responsive in handling congestion. Therefore, this study was made to analyze and determine which road segments need special attention, help traffic management, make it easier for users to find out the latest traffic information, and make relevant parties able to take quick response actions. This paper is using social media data, social network such as Facebook is able to provide a real-time data. this data can be processed to gain a powerful insight. However, processing social media data have challenge due to the raw text format, therefore the text processing needs to be done in order to make the data readable. In Jakarta, there is an official account which post a traffic condition in Jakarta. In this paper we are getting the post data from this account, do text processing on it and make a reports and dashboard to provide any user insight regarding the traffic data in Jakarta. © 2019 IEEE.","congestion; dashboard; real time; report; social media; text processing","Data handling; Road vehicles; Social networking (online); Text processing; congestion; dashboard; Real time; report; Social media; Traffic congestion",,,,,"McIntee, J., How to beat the burn-out (1984) Health Soc.

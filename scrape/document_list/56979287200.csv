The application can benefit to many problems in the world. For example: recognising text in documents, classifying the text or scripts of documents, plate recognition, etc. Many researchers have been developed the methods for recognising characters in by using Optical Character Recognition methods. Although text recognition problem using Optical Character Recognition has been more or less solved, most of the Optical Character Recognition problem explored is belong to Latin alphabet texts. Meanwhile, there are several languages have non-Latin scripts as the written text. Recognising a non-Latin script is quite challenging as the contour and shape of the text are relatively different with a Latin script text. This research aims to collect datasets for OCR in Javanese characters. A total of 5880 characters were collected and trained with several methods with Tesseract OCR tools. The models then be implemented to a mobile phone (Android based). The highest accuracy (97,50%) achieved by the model was achieved by combining single boundary box for the whole parts of the character and the separate boundary boxes in main body and sandangan parts. © 2019 The Authors.

The face should be still during the acquisition process; otherwise, the resulted image would be blur and hard for recognition. Enforcing persons to stand still during the process is impractical; extremely likely that recognition should be performed on a blurred image. It is important to understand the relation between the image blur and the recognition accuracy. The ORL Database was used in the study. All images were in PGM format of 92 × 112 pixels from forty different persons, ten images per person. Those images were randomly divided into training and testing datasets with 50-50 ratio. Singular value decomposition was used to extract the features. The images in the testing datasets were artificially blurred to represent a linear motion, and recognition was performed. The blurred images were also filtered using various methods. The accuracy levels of the recognition on the basis of the blurred faces and filtered faces were compared. The performed numerical study suggests that at its best, the image improvement processes are capable to improve the recognition accuracy level by less than five percent. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Face recognition; Image blurring; Laplacian filter; Singular value decomposition",,,,,,,"Chellappa, R., Wilson, C.L., Sirohey, S., Human and machine recognition of faces: A survey (1995) Proceedings of the IEEE, 83, pp. 705-740; Li, S.Z., Jain, A.K., (2005) Handbook of face recognition, , Springer; Heitmeyer, R., Biometric identification promises fast and secure processing of airline passengers (2000) ICAO Journal, 55, pp. 1-6; Turk, M., Pentland, A., Eigenfaces for recognition (1991) Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 3, pp. 71-86; Ji, Y., Lin, T., Zha, H., Mahalanobis distance based non-negative sparse representation for face recognition (2009) International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, pp. 41-46. , IEEE; Ben-Ezra, M., Nayar, S.K., Motion-based motion deblurring (2004) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 26, pp. 689-698; Yadav, M., Omprakas, M., A comparative study for deblurred motion blurred images (2013) International Journal of Emerging Research in Management and Technology, 2, pp. 51-55; Yitzhaky, Y., Mor, A.L.I., Kopeika, N.S., Direct method for restoration of motion-blurred images (1998) JOSAA, 15, pp. 1512-1519; Vageeswaran, P., Mitra, K., Chellappa, R., Blur and illumination robust face recognition via set-theoretic characterization (2013) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 22, pp. 1362-1372; Kalotra, R., Sagar, S.A., A novel algorithm for blurred image restoration in the field of medical imaging (2014) International Journal for Science and Emerging, 17, pp. 21-26; Punnappurath, A., Rajagopalan, A.N., Taheri, S., Chellappa, R., Seetharaman, G., Face recognition across non-uniform motion blur, illumination, and pose (2015) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 24, pp. 2067-2082; Moghaddam, M.E., Jamzad, M., Linear motion blur parameter estimation in noisy images using fuzzy sets and power spectrum (2007) EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing, pp. 1-8; Al-Ameen, Z., Sulong, G., Johar, M.G.M., A comprehensive study on fast image deblurring techniques (2012) International Journal of Advanced Science and Technology, 44, pp. 1-10; Jain, A.K., Ross, A., Pankanti, S., Biometrics: A tool for information security (2006) IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, pp. 125-143; Gupta, G., Algorithm for image processing using improved median filter and comparison of mean, median and improved median filter (2011) International Journal of Soft Computing and Engineering (IJSCE), 1, pp. 304-311; Sakthivel, N., Prabhu, L., Mean-median filtering for impulsive noise removal (2014) 185 International Journal of Basics and Applied Sciences, 2, pp. 47-57; Gonzalez, R.C., Woods, R.E., (2007) Digital Image Processing, , 3rd Edition, Prentice Hall; Wu, J.-L., Chang, C.-F., Chen, C.-S., An adaptive richardson-lucy algorithm for single image deblurring using local extrema filtering (2013) Journal of Applied Science and Engineering, 16, pp. 269-276; Mane, R.V., Kolte, M.T., Implementation of adaptive filtering algorithm for speech signal on fpga (2014) International Journal of Innovative Research in Electrical, Electronics, Instrumentation and Control Engineering, 2, pp. 1160-1164; Kaur, A., Chopra, V., A comparative study and analysis of image restoration techniques using different images formats (2012) International Journal for Science and Emerging Technologies with Latest Trends, 2, pp. 7-14; Gunawan, A.A.S., Prasetyo, R.A., Face Recognition Performance in Facing Pose Variation (2017) CommIT (Communication & Information Technology) Journal, 11 (1), pp. 1-7; Lumentut, J.S., Gunawan, F.E., Diana, Evaluation of Recursive Background Subtraction Algorithms for Real-Time Passenger Counting at Bus Rapid Transit System (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 445-453; Lumentut, J.S., Gunawan, F.E., Atmadja, W., Abbas, B.S., A system for real-time passenger monitoring system for bus rapid transit system (2015) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 9012, pp. 398-407","Gunawan, F.E.; Industrial Engineering Department, Jl.

Content Based Image Retrieval System (CBIR) is a technique used for finding relevant images from those huge and unannotated image databases based on low-level features of the query images. In this study, an attempt to employ 2nd level Wavelet Based Color Histogram (WBCH) on a CBIR system is proposed.

This trend is making people do activities on their smartphone such as exchange information, playing games, paying bills, discussing ideas, etc. In almost every smartphone, security features (i.e. password, pin, face unlock) are already built in which are intended to protect the data inside the smartphone. Nevertheless, those security features are not perfect and have flaws either technically or by human errors. This research aim to provide an application that uses people' facial expressions to improve the security of smartphone, namely Android. We implement face detection and expression recognition in this application as an improvement from the existing unlock screen, which is face unlock. The results that are achieved from this research is an unlock screen application on Android devices that utilizes people' facial expression changes to open their smartphone. This application can eliminates the technical errors from existing face unlock screen application which can be deceived by photos. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.","Biometric; Face expression recognition; Unlock screen","Android (operating system); Biometrics; Face recognition; Manufacture; Security systems; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Android smartphone; Application design; Expression recognition; Face expression recognition; Face expressions; Facial Expressions; Security features; Technical errors; Mobile security",,,,,,"Ahmad, F., Najam, A., Ahmed, Z., Image-based Face detection and recognition: ""state of the art (2012) IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, 9 (6), pp. 169-172. , no. 1; Dashore, G., Raj, V.C., An efficient method for face recognition using principal component analysis (2012) International Journal of Advanced Technnology & Engineering Research, II, 2, pp. 23-28; Saudagare, P.V., Chaudhari, D.S., Facial expression recognition using neural network-An overview (2012) International Journal of Soft Computing and Engineering (IJSCE), 2 (1), pp. 224-227; Baggio, D.L., (2012) Mastering OpenCV with Practical Computer Vision Projects, , Packt Publishing; Jiang, B., Valstar, M.F., Martinez, B., Pantic, M., A dynamic appearance descriptor approach to facial actions temporal modelling (2014) IEEE Transactions of Systems, Man and Cybernetics-Part B, 44 (2), pp. 161-174. , 2011 and; Tan, X., Triggs, B., Enhanced local texture feature sets for face recognition under difficult lighting conditions (2010) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 19, pp. 1635-1650; Valstar, M.F., Pantic, M., Fully automatic recognition of the temporal phases of facial actions (2012) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, 42 (1), pp. 28-43; Jiang, B., Valstar, M.F., Pantic, M., Action Unit detection using sparse appearance descriptors in space-time video volumes (2011) IEEE int'L.

COVID-19 was since being the headlines of the news offline and online. This trigger either positive or negative responses from the readers, which in turn affect at least the depth of understanding and furthermore the effectiveness of any enforced intervention taken with the purpose to control the transmission of the COVID-19. In order to assess how likely the COVID-19-containing news being forwarded to reach more readers and how the pertinent news bridge further virtual interaction, we crawled data from Twitter as the major online microblogging platform to analyze how likely COVID-19-containing tweets were echoed and what typical tweet about COVID-19 that gained attentions. This is critical to evaluate how people virtually responded against the tweets. Our analyzed data is visualized using Matplotlib by Python and Graph Prism8 accordingly. We figured out that timing and number of followers are not determinative for the tweets being retweeted. Instead, provoking headline add likelihood for the tweets to be moving forward. Also appeared in our analysis that the top two media (Detik and Kompas) shared the same proportion on their tweet type fractions on where information dominated the fraction of their tweets. © 2020 IEEE.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Retweet; Tweet; Twitter","Electronic assessment; Information management; Coronaviruses; Indonesia; Micro-blogging platforms; Offline; Virtual interactions; Social networking (online)",,,,,,"Adhikari, S.P., Meng, S., Wu, Y., Mao, Y., Ye, R., Wang, Q., (2020) Epidemiology, Causes, Clinical Manifestation and Diagnosis, Prevention and Control of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) during the Early Outbreak Period: A Scoping Review, pp. 1-12; (2020) Novel Coronavirus-Japan (Ex China), , https://www.who.int/csr/don/17-january-2020-novel-coronavirusjapan-ex-china/en/, Accessed 9 April 2020; (2020) COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic, , https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/, Worldometer.

We hence develop a database system which enables time series monitoring on the expected increment of children's physical growth. At this initial step, our database system will be implemented at Public Health Office (Dinas Kesehatan) of Serdang Bedagai, South Celebes. This is a modification from Connoly and Begg's principles. Our database was built through 3-steps design started with conceptual followed by logical and at final step was normalizations-enriched physical design.

The nature of dietary patterns of specific Indonesia population on the risk of colorectal cancer might differ from previously published data with the global population. Therefore, we conducted a study where the dietary pattern in colorectal cancer patient cohorts was compared to age- and population-matched control. We documented 89 colorectal cancer cases and among 173 individuals from the South Sulawesi population. A series of logistic regression and Fisher’s exact tests were utilized to test associations of dietary intakes and colorectal cancer risk as well as colorectal cancer staging. Our data demonstrate that vegetable (p-value = 8.70 × 10−26, OR = 0.49) and fruit (p-value = 7.59x10−5, OR = 0.70) intakes are associated with the reduced risk of colorectal cancer incidence. Conversely, acidic food, reheated food, meat, spicy food, and alcohol are associated with the increment case of cancer. Moreover, meat intake (p-value &lt; 0.01) shows a significant association with cancer staging progression.

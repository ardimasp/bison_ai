Nowadays, governments try to develop public service system based on e-commerce called e-government. One of e-government which is currently being introduced to the public is e-Filing system for filing tax report. However, until now we do not know why a lot of people still do not adopt the e-Filing system. The purpose of writing this research study is to analyze factors that influence user acceptance of the e-Filing system. This is done by evaluating user acceptance based on human behavior theory towards the use of information systems. The research is based on a combination of UTAUT and IS Success Model. The data collected was from distributing questionnaires to 394 respondents of e-Filing users in Pontianak. All data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with SPSS AMOS 22. The test results of this research found that factors influence user acceptance of e-Filing system in Pontianak are Information Quality (IQ), Service Quality (SQ) and System Quality (SYQ), Use Behavior (UB), User Satisfaction (US) and Behavior Intention. © 2005 - Ongoing JATIT & LLS.","e-Filing; Structural Equation Model; User Acceptance",,,,,,"(2012) Kementerian Komunikasi Dan Informatika Buku Putih, , Jakarta: Badan Penelitian dan Pengembangan Sumber Daya Manusia Kementerian Komunikasi dan Informatika; Liang, S.-W., Lu, H.-P., Adoption of e-government services: An empirical study of the online tax filing system in Taiwan (2013) Online Information Review, 37, pp. 424-442; Stafford, T.F., Turan, A.H., Online tax payment systems as an emergent aspect of governmental transformation (2011) European Journal of Information Systems, pp. 343-357; Connolly, R., Bannister, F., Kearney, A., Government website service quality: A study of the Irish revenue online service (2010) European Journal of Information Systems, pp. 649-667; Isfahani, S., Jahanbakhsh, M., Habibi, M., Mirzaeian, R., Nasirian, M., Rad, J., A Survey on the Users’ Satisfaction with the Hospital Information Systems (HISs) based on DeLone and McLean’s Model in the Medical-Teaching Hospitals in Isfahan City (2014) ACTA INFORM MED, pp. 179-182; (2008) Peraturan Direktur Pajak Nomor 47/PJ/2008, , Jakarta: Direktorat Jendral Pajak Republik Indonesia; Azmi, A.C., Ng, L.B., (2010) The Acceptance of the E-Filing System by Malaysian Taxpayers: A Simplified Model, pp. 13-21. , Academic Conferences International Limited; Venkatesh, V., Morris, M.G., Davis, G.B., Davis, F.D., User Acceptance Of Information Technology: Toward A Unified View (2003) MIS Quartery, 27, pp. 425-478; Williams, M.D., Rana, N.P., Dwivedi, Y.K., The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT): A literature review (2015) Journal of Enterprise Information Management, pp. 443-488; Venkatesh, V., Thong, J., Xin, X., Consumer Acceptance And Use Of Information Technology: Extending The Unified Theory Of Acceptance And Use Of Technology (2012) Forthcoming in MIS Quarterly, pp. 157-178; Chang, A., Utaut And Utaut 2: A Review And Agenda For Future Research (2012) Journal the WINNERS, pp. 106-114; Delone, W., McLean, E., The DeLone and McLean Model of Information Systems Success: A Ten-Year Update (2003) Journal of Management Information Systems, 19, pp. 9-30; Petter, S., Deleon, W., McLean, E., Information Systems Success: The Quest for the Independent Variables (2013) Journal of Management Information Systems, pp. 6-61; Fu, J.-R., Farn, C.-K., Chao, W.-P., Acceptance of electronic tax filing: A study of taxpayer intentions.

While its antecedents can be classified into several aspects, the uncontrollable nature of market conditions remains one of the most interesting causes of price wars. Using a sample of respondents in the Indonesian lighting industry, this research is aimed to generate an understanding of how practitioners view their market conditions in relation to competition and the steps to overcome price wars. Survey data were collected through quantitative methodology from various managers and decision-makers in the industry. Based on statistical result of Smart PLS, the study found that firms regard price wars as the result of the pursuit of profit through growth, within the context of competition. © 2019 IJSTR.","External market conditions; Indonesian lighting industry; Price wars; Smart PLS",,,,,,"Bernheim, D.B., Whinston, M.D., Multimarket Contact and Collusive Behavior (1990) J.

However, several literatures had acknowledged that this condition was the result of an abnormal internal condition, where firms competed not to engage in competitive selling activities but rather as an effort to maintain performance. This paper was written and prepared as part of a recent study in the Indonesian lighting industry, where many players in the industry considered themselves caught in a severe price war condition. Based on a qualitative survey using open-ended interviews of seven lighting companies in Indonesia, the study found that the industry regard price wars as the result of severe intra-brand competition and an effort to maintain the “status quo” of continuous growth. Propositions to ease friction in price were suggested: exploration to other market segments; exploiting information to induce loyalty; understanding rivalry through capacity size; and management of short-term performance constraints. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Internal firm condition; Lighting industry; Price Wars",,,,,,"Barney, J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Composite Materials, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Bhattacharya, R.R., (1999) Short-Run Constraints and Price Wars, , Sydney, Australia; Bungert, M., (2003) Termination of Price Wars: A Signaling Approach, , Wiesbaden: Deutscher Universitäts-Verlag; Busse, M., Firm financial condition and airline price wars (2000) The RAND Journal of Economics, 33 (2), pp. 298-318; Caves, R.E., Porter, M.E., From entry barriers to mobility barriers: Conjectural decisions and contrived deterrence to new competition (1977) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 91 (2), pp. 241-261; Ciriminna, R., Albanese, L., Meneguzzo, F., Pagliaro, M., LED street lighting: A looking ahead perspective (2015) Green, 5 (1-6), pp. 83-94; Deneckere, R., Kovenock, D., Price leadership (1992) The Review of Economic Studies, 59 (1), pp. 143-162; Deneckere, R., Kovenock, D., Lee, R., A model of price leadership based on consumer loyalty (1992) The Journal of Industrial Economics, 40 (2), pp. 147-156; Diallo, M.F., Coutelle-Brillet, P., Riviere, A., Zielke, S., How do price perceptions of different brand types affect shopping value and store loyalty?

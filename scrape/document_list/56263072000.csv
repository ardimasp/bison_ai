The need for a web for every teacher or lecturer in building multi-channel learning process is a challenge of building the advanced education itself. The objective of this research is to create a web application design with the use of Information Technology and Telecommunication (ICT) or SMS Gateway of academic information. The method of the research used by the author is Field Research, where data collection was done through direct observation on the users in order to obtain as much information as possible from the users to learn what the users want in the making of SMS Gateway information system. Meanwhile, the methodology of the software development is using the Rapid Application Development (RAD) or Prototype model approach. For the design analysis of the academic information SMS Gateway system, the author used the Object Oriented Analysis Design (OOAD) approach using the Use Case Diagram, Sequence Diagram, Class Diagram and web application implementation using PHP and MySql software as well as SMS Gateway software with Gammu. The conclusion of this research is that the use of academic information SMS Gateway on college or university students is very effective for the learning activity process and institution service quality improvement as well as for helping the lecturers to obtain information of their students' quiz score real time. The result of this research is that the mastery of science and technology through the academic information SMS Gateway application prototype creation. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

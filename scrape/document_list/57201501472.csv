Based on their first semester result, using machine learning techniques, the student's final year result (GPA) can be predicted. The data used in this experiment are from the computer science subjects, 6 subjects, 1 laboratories results and the GPA on their graduation year. The techniques used in this experiment are Generalized Linear Model, Deep Learning and Decision Tree. From this result, what are the important factors that impact on the result can be extracted to help the students prepared themselves earlier. © 2018 IEEE.","Data Mining; Machine Learning; Soft Computing; Student's Performance - GPA","Data mining; Decision trees; Education computing; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Pattern recognition; Soft computing; Students; Education field; Generalized linear model; Machine learning techniques; Student's performance; Deep learning",,,,,"Pangkalan Data Pendidikan Tinggi, , https://forlap.ristekdikti.go.id/, [Online].

The concept used based on usabilitygeek.com which mentions the three main categories for usability testing, i. e. explorative, assessment and comparative with the users are three classes of Communication Department students of Bina Nusantara University with a total of 120 students, however finally only 22 students were elected because of the criteria are the students should be like travelling and access to the tourism website more than 12 times. The methodology used is qualitative descriptive and experiments, with data collection techniques through observation and interviews after participants' access to the web: Due to their one-on-one nature, interviews enable the observer to ask direct questions to the user and the participants posted their opinion in online discussion forum. The results mentioned that the elements web of Wonderful Indonesia has a high learning ability and memorability but less efficiency and satisfaction, as well as several times errors when used. In conclusion, to maximize about the visit of tourism to Indonesia, this web is only able to learn and impress the visitor, but do not give satisfaction to users. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Students; Websites; Data collection; Foreign exchange; Indonesians; Learning abilities; Online discussion forums; Tourism promotion; Tourism websites; Usability testing; Web Design",,,,,"Industri Pariwisata Indonesia, , https://www.indonesia-investments.com/id/bisnis/industri-sektor/pariwisata/item6051, Indonesia Investments 16 December 2016.

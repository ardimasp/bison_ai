The results of the analysis tell that there is a need for an accounting information system for revenue cycle that can integrate company’s business process, so that all transaction data can be found and stored properly. As this accounting information system is created, it is expected to reduce problems such as data lost and the risk of fraud due to creating documents manually. The method that is use based on the problems that have been found to a business process design is created by using Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) which is illustrated through the Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram notation. The proposed of the business process design provides solutions to the problems in revenue cycle by creating a system that includes cash and credit sales, return of goods, and making reports that can work quickly and accurately to improve the performance with the integrated systems. © 2020 SERSC.","Accounting Information Systems; Analysis; Design; Revenue Cycle",,,,,,,"Burmaoglu, S., Sartenaer, O., Porter, A., Conceptual definition of technology emergence: A long journey from philosophy of science to science policy (2019) Technology in Society, 1; Ranjith, V.K., Business Models and Competitive Advantage (2016) Procedia Economics and Finance, 37, pp. 203-207; Budiansyah, O., Safitricherrya, Y., Pengaruh Perputaran Kas, Perputaran Piutang, dan Perputaran Persediaan Terhadap Profitabilitas (2016) Jurnal Skripsi, pp. 1-3; Berisha-Shaqiri, A., Impact of Information Technology and Internet in Businesses (2015) Cademic Journal of Business, Administration, Law and Social Sciences, pp. 73-79; Amanamah, R.B., Morrison, A., Asiedu, K., Computerized Accounting Systems Usage by Small and Medium Scale Enterprises in Kumasi Metropolis, Ghana (2016) Research Journal of Finance and Accounting, 7 (16); Australia, C., Harnessing digital technology, keeping the customer in focus (2017) The Fintech Advantage, 13; Fagbemi, T.O., Olaoye, J.A., An Evaluation Of Accounting Information System And Performance Of Small Scale Enterprises In Kwara State, Nigeria (2016) DBA Africa Management Review, 1; Patel, B.P., Effects of accounting information system on Organizational Profitability (2015) Swami Sahajanand College of Commerce and Management, 72; Ranjith, V.K., Business Models and Competitive Advantage (2016) Procedia Economics and Finance, 37, pp. 203-207; Accounting Information Systems and how to prepare for Digital Transformation (2017) The Routledge Companion to Accounting Information Systems, p. 12. , Rehm; Romney, M.B., Steinbart, P.J., (2018) Accounting Information Systems 14E, , Pearson; Satzinger, J.W., Jackson, R.B., Burd, S.D., (2016) Systems Analysis and Design","Noerlina; Information Systems Department, Indonesia; email: nurlina@binus.edu",,,"Science and Engineering Research Support Society",,,,,20054238,,,,"English","Int.

One of the ERP System is Dynamics NAV used by IGMLabs. Nevertheless, with the revenue sharing process at IGMLabs, modification is needed to automate the manual summarizing hospital transactions from excel and to automate the manual sales invoice creation process. The sales process, especially the revenue sharing process will be analyzed with ABC or Activity-Based Costing method and the modification will be implemented with Agile technique with steps from Roger S. Pressman's Extreme Programming (XP) model and the testing will use the Blackbox Testing method.

The condition of vocational education disparities in Indonesia is very high. Teachers who are really involved and have competence in the vocational field are needed. That is, the teacher experiences a unified whole within himself between the profession, professionalism, self-capacity and work itself which shows the totality of work but not workaholics called the Indonesian Vocational Teacher Engagement (I-VOCATIE). There are two formulations of the problem, namely: (a) what is the tendency of the condition of vocational teacher engagement in Indonesia? and (b) what is the most powerful dimension determining the formation of vocational teacher engagement in Indonesia? The research design was deployed a surveying method using the Neuroresearch model. The Neuroresearch method is a research method developed by Sasmoko which is a mixed method which consists of three research phases, namely exploratory research, explanatory research and exploratory research. These three stages can be done at once and can also be done alone. In this paper, we only used two stages, there are exploratory research and explanatory research. It was based on multistage sampling technique, the total sample of 856 vocational teachers in 30 provinces in Indonesia were managed to be collected. Data collection techniques with a Likert scale questionnaire ranging from 1 to 5. The results of the study: (a) vocational teachers in Indonesia tend to have internalized teacher professional status and the profession has become an interesting thing teachers develop significantly at α <0.05, and (b ) Nation Character (Nat_Char_X4) is the most powerful dimension determining the formation of vocational teacher engagement in Indonesia (Voc_TeachE_Y). Increasing the teacher's performance will improve the nation character of vocational teachers. 2020 UTHM Publisher.","IR 4.0; Neuroresearch; Teacher competencies; Teacher engagement",,,,,"Binus University","This work is partially supported by Bina Nusantara University, the Indonesian Ministry of Research and Higher Education for supporting this research.

There are four main data source used for the input of the system in this work, where each data corresponds to a city in a region. All the data are processed into corresponding index, while the indexes will be further used in index interpretation and suggestion mapping process. The output of this system is a decision support system for relevant decision making related to corruption prevention, visualized using Google Map API. This system will be very powerful in the long and tedious war against corruption, when used to its maximum potential. © 2019 IEEE.","civilian-based corruption prevention; corruption mapping index; corruption prevention","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Heuristic methods; Information management; Mapping; civilian-based corruption prevention; corruption mapping index; corruption prevention; Google map api; Heuristic analysis; Mapping process; Prevention systems; Technological advancement; Crime",,,,,"ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by Directorate General of Research and Development Strengthening, Indonesian Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi","Nawatmi, S., Korupsi dan Pertumbuhan Ekonomi Negara-Negara Asia Pasifik (2014) Jurnal Bisnis Dan Ekonomi, 21 (1); (2018) Slow, Imperfect Progress Across Asia Pacific, , https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/slowimperfect_progress_across_asia_pacific, Transparency International 21 February.

We analyzed over s even significant publishers with a total of 126 keywords to find the most suitable publisher s and the best keywords for our research. After determining the keyword and publisher, we analyzed 101 records of journal articles in Taylor and Francis publisher. We analyze all the aspects, including meta data for each record, topic of research, object of research, and we also added consideration of ICT aspect inclusion in each record. Our findings suggest th at: (1) there are more research in Africa and Europe comp ared to the rest of the world; (2) corruption prevention effort mentioning ICT has increased 4.5 times in the time period of 2016 2018 compared to 2013 2015; (3) there are more research focusing in practicability and less in basic research in the time peri od of 2016 2018 compared to 2013 2015.

In current modern society, information technology exists as a multidisciplinary tool to solve lingering problems that could not be solved by traditional efforts. This paper aims to provide knowledge regarding identified efforts to fight corruption specifically in Indonesia region. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology is used as the methodology, and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow is used as framework to identify relevant records. Scopus database is used as data source. A total of 10 records are labelled as relevant to this research, and the findings are synthesized. It was found from the records that the main areas of interest for ICT research for corruption prevention in Indonesia are (1) information transparency, (2) operational enhancement, (3) success evaluation, (4) security and fraud, and (4) decision support. The findings are expected to assist future research in term of providing valuable insights on corruption prevention using ICT in Indonesia. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In most university, management must be able to collect all hundreds of proposals and reports; not to mention they must be able to accommodate the process of reviewing every single proposal. They also need to monitor all research output in final report and make sure that all of the outputs are correctly achieved from proposed target. In addition to the problems stated, previous activities are done manually, leaving a lot of opportunity to improve and automate the process. All of the addressable opportunity for improvement are explained and explored, thus a model of the web application is created. This paper presents the design of web application used to solve persistent problem in research management, specifically in Binus University. The design methodology is divided into two phases: requirement engineering phase, and system design. Upon finishing the requirement engineering phase, system model is depicted using Unified Modeling Language, specifically: Activity Diagram, Use Case Diagram, and Conceptual Class Diagram. © 2018 IEEE.","higher education; research management system; unified modeling language","Information management; Systems analysis; Telecommunication services; Unified Modeling Language; Design Methodology; Design of web applications; Higher education; Requirement engineering; Research activities; Research management; Research management systems; Research outputs; Design",,,,,,"Braddock, R., Neave, G., Research management in higher education: Overview and conclusion of a debate (2002) Higher Education Policy, 15 (3), pp. 313-330; Shon, H.S., Han, S.H., Kim, K.A., Cha, E.J., Ryu, K.H., Proposal reviewer recommendation system based on big data for a national research management institute (2017) Journal of Information Science, 43 (2), pp. 147-158; Lu, R., (2016) University Teaching and Research and Scientific Research Performance Quantitative Statistics System; Morgan, A., Duffield, N., Walkley Hall, L., Research data management support: Sharing our experiences (2017) Journal of the Australian Library and Information Association, 66 (3), pp. 299-305; Liu, Y., Yao, Y., Zhang, X., Liu, B., Ding, C., Design of research management system based on workflow and rapid development platform technology (2015) Estimation, Detection and Information Fusion (ICEDIF), 2015 International Conference on, pp. 329-334. , IEEE, January; Morales, M.P.E., Abulon, E.L.R., Ermita, R.C., David, A.P., Organizing and systematizing knowledge management through an automated university-based research Portal (2017) Asia Pacific Journal of Multidisciplinary Research, 5, p. 3; Pressman, R.S., Software engineering-A practitioners approach (2015) Mc Graw-Hill International Edition, 2010; Matthias, R., Tools & Techniques Expert Opinion, Online, , http://www.idemployee.id.tue.nl/g.w.m.rauterberg/lecturenotes/UFTexp.ertopinion.pdf; Rumbaugh, J., Booch, G., Jacobson, I., (2017) The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual, , Addison Wesley; Dumas, M., Ter Hofstede, A.H., UML activity diagrams as a workflow specification language (2001) International Conference on the Unified Modeling Language, pp. 76-90. , Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, October; Jena, A.K., Swain, S.K., Mohapatra, D.P., A novel approach for test case generation from UML activity diagram (2014) Issues and Challenges in Intelligent Computing Techniques (ICICT), 2014 International Conference on, pp. 621-629. , IEEE, February; Ikram, M.T., Butt, N.A., Hussain, A., Nadeem, A., Testing from uml design using activity diagram: A comparison of techniques (2015) International Journal of Computer Applications, 131, p. 5; Seidl, M., Scholz, M., Huemer, C., Kappel, G., The use case diagram (2015) UML@ Classroom, pp. 23-47. , Springer, Cham",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2018","3 September 2018 through 5 September 2018",,142373,,9781538658215,,,"English","Proc.

To imagine the severances of it, 10.000 KM of highway can be built with that much amount of fund. Several responses has been done by Indonesian government to fight corruption from both prevention and persecution. This work focuses on the development of a web application aimed to provide insight to corruption case per province in Indonesia. The web application was developed using Machine Learning, specifically Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Web crawling and web scraping techniques are used to gather news content from 7 major news portal in Indonesia. Accuracy is measured by comparing correct prediction by ANN to its true value. Upon finding corruption news, data is saved and further analysis is done to establish the number of corruption news per region. Finally, the output is visualized using Google Map API. The purpose of this work is to provide regional depiction of corruption case to give further insight to be used by decision makers. Upon using this web application, objectivity of program development is expected to increase. The final output of the web application is a map of corruption case in Indonesia per region.

When changes happen, employees need to adapt to the work environment and this can influence many aspects of employees’ working life. The performance of employees will influence the performance of an organisation and one of the factors that influences employee performance is employee motivation. The changes can be through communication and culture differences. Television broadcasting service companies must focus on their human resource because they employ a large number of workers. There are 19 major television companies in Indonesia. The broadcasting industry is one of the pioneers of private television stations in Indonesia. Media Citra Nusantara owns RCTI, Global TV and iNews TV. The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of organisational communication and organisational culture on employee motivation and its impact on employee performance in the broadcasting industry. The method of data collection used in this study is the questionnaire. Questionnaires were distributed to 300 employees. The data analysis method used in this study is path analysis. The results of this study shows that organisational culture does not influence employee performance, while organisational communication and employee motivation influence employee performance. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Employee motivation; Employee performance; Organisational communication; Organisational culture; Path analysis",,,,,,,"Azar, M., Shafighi, A.A., The effect of work motivation on employees’ job (2013) International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences, 3 (9), pp. 1-9; Bhatia, K., Balani, M., Effective internal communication: A crucial factor affecting employee performance (2015) Proceedings of International Conference on Management, Economics and Social Sciences, , Dubai; Browaeys, M.J., Price, R., (2011) Understanding Cross-Culture Management, , Ontario: Perason Education; Chaudhary, N., Sharma, D.B., Impact of employee motivation on performance (productivity) in private organization (2012) International Journal of Business Trends and Technology, 2 (4), pp. 29-35; Ganta, V.C., Motivation in the work place to improve employee performance (2014) International Journal of Engineering Technology, Management and Applied Science, 2 (6), pp. 221-230; Ghozali, I., (2011) Aplikasi Analisis Multivariate Dengan Program SPSS [Application of Multivariate Analysis Using The SPSS Programme], , Semarang: Badan Penerbit Universitas Diponegoro; Harris, T.E., Nelson, M.D., (2008) Applied Organizational Communication: Theory and Practice in A Global Environment, , New York: Lawrence Erlbaum; Iqbal, A., Ijaz, M., Latif, F., Mushtaq, H., Factors affecting employees’ performance: A case of the banking sector in Pakistan (2015) European Journal of Business and Social Science, 4 (8), pp. 309-318; Karki, J., Types of business communication (2012) Business Communication, , jb-karki.blogspot.com/2012/02/types-of-business-communication.html?m=1; Locker, K., Kaczmarek, S., (2010) Business Communication: Building Critical Skills, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Neves, P., Eisenberger, R., Management communication and employee (2012) Human Performance, 25 (5), pp. 452-464; Rajhans, K., Effective organizational communication: A key to employee motivation and performance (2012) Interscience Management Review, 2 (2), pp. 81-85; Ramadanty, S., Martinus, H., Organizational communication and motication in the work place (2016) HUMANIORA, 7 (1), pp. 77-86; Rounok, N., Parvin, M.M., Fostering employee performance: A literature review (2011) Industrial Engineering Letters, 1 (3), pp. 1-9; Sekaran, U., Bougie, R., (2013) Research Methods for Business, , West Sussex, UK: John Wiley & Sons; Simamora, B.H., Leadership for performance excellence (2013) International Business Management, 7 (4), pp. 247-257; Simamora, B.H., Marsellinus, J., Hartono, H., Strategy alignment with organizational culture assessment instrument (OCAI) results of cellular industry in Indonesia (2016) International Journal of Economics and Management, 10 (S1), pp. 81-93; Sugiyono, (2013) Statistika Untuk Penelitian [Statistics for Research], , Bandung: Alfabeta; Tabanchnick, B.G., Fidell, L.S., (2014) Using Multivariate Statistic, , (6th ed.).

The government has an important role in economic growth. However, there are still many civil servants who abuse their positions to do corruption. The central government should pay more attention to each region to avoid corruption cases. For developing a mapping system, Naïve Bayes classifier is needed to classify news about corruption and non-corruption. N-Gram and Hash Table were used to map corruption cases based on Indonesia’s administrative territory. The experimental results showed that Naïve Bayes classification achieved 100% accuracy for training and testing. However, N-Gram and Hash Table achieved 85% accuracy for mapping the location of the article. © 2018 ICIC International.","Corruption; Corruption perception index; Indonesia; System development",,,,,,,"(2014), http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/indonesia/overview; (2017), http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/GDP.pdf; Noerlina, L.A.W., Sasmoko, A.M.M., Alamsyah, M., Corruption cases mapping based on Indonesia’s corruption perception index (2017) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 801 (1); (2017), http://www.corruptionwatch.org.za/learn-about-corruption/what-is-corruption/our-definition-of-corruption; Siddique, M., Ghosh, R., (2014) Corruption, Good Governance and Economic Development: Contemporary Analysis and Case Studies, , World Scientific Publishing, Singapore; (2009), https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/the_anti_corruption_plain_language_guide; Shah, A., Schacter, M., Combinating corruption: Look before you leap (2004) Finance Development, 4, pp. 40-43; Mauro, P., Why Worry about Corruption?

But it still raises some obstacles in the implementation, as it relates to equity and access. In another aspect, e-learning also contains major weaknesses, namely the decrease in the frequency of direct contact between learners and between students with lecturers and other learning resources, so that learning does not experience completeness in all aspects of cognitive and non-cognitive. The weakness is also accompanied by the suspicion of the institution to the honesty of learners in carrying out the learning process. This study aims at building an e-learning model that can bring the intensity and capacity of learners actually through the virtual world through self-assessment based on image processing. The proposed steps are break into several parts: create a dataset of faces that can be used to evaluate given algorithm. Subsequently the enhancement using histogram equalization allows a strong enhancement on facial features. In addition, then the feature descriptor are selected using Viola and Jones [1]. Afterwards, those features will be saved to database. The next step is to build the system than allows the online learners are detected through our image processing approach then all the interaction will be verified using our proposed infrastructure. The results of the study: (a) Image Processing Based E-Learning model was built with a system capable of running in existing infrastructure so far, and (b) Image Processing Based E-Learning model proved valid and reliable both substantially, system and feasibility significant. The results of this study have implications that can be tested on a larger scale that is for some courses and in a particular department. © 2017 IEEE.","E-Learning; Image Processing; Mastery Learning","E-learning; Education computing; Information management; Learning systems; Teaching; Virtual reality; E-learning models; Electronic information; Feature descriptors; Histogram equalizations; Learning process; Learning resource; Mastery learning; Strong enhancement; Image processing",,,,,,"Viola, P., Jones, M., Rapid object detection using a boosted cascade of simple features (2001) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 1, pp. I511-I518; Lockee, B.B., Gros, B., (2017) Learning, Design, and Technology, pp. 1-23. , http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-17727-4, [Online]; Sahid, D.S.S., Santosa, P.I., Ferdiana, R., Lukito, E.N., Evaluation and measurement of Learning Management System based on user experience (2016) Engineering Seminar (InAES), International Annual, pp. 72-77; Tavangarian, D., Leypold, M.E., Nölting, K., Röser, M., Voigt, D., Is e-learning the solution for individual learning?

OJS is an open-source journal management platform that provides a streamlined journal publishing workflow. TextRank is an unsupervised, graph-based ranking model commonly used as extractive auto summarization of text documents. This study applies the TextRank algorithm to summarize 50 article reviews from an OJS-based international journal. The resulting summaries are formed using the most representative sentences extracted from the reviews. The summaries are then used to help OJS editors in assessing a review's quality. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Graphic methods; Information services; Publishing; Graph based rankings; International journals; Journal publishing; Management platforms; Open sources; Text document; Reviews",,,,,,"Edgar, B.D., Willinsky, J., A survey of the scholarly journals using Open Journal Systems (2010) Sch.

Nevertheless, there are still many occurrences of government officers abusing their offices to do an act of corruption. In this order, the central government should pay attention to every area in the nation to avoid corruption case. Meanwhile, the news media always constantly preach about corruption case, this makes the news media relevant for being one of the sources of measurement of corruption perception index (CPI). It is required to map the corruption case in Indonesia so the central government can pay attention to every region in Indonesia. To develop the mapping system, researchers use Naïve Bayes Classifier to classify which news articles talk about corruption and which news articles are not, before implementing a Naïve Bayes Classifier there are some text processing such as tokenizing, stopping, and stemming. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Economics; Mapping; Sodium; Text processing; Bayes Classifier; Central government; Corruption perception indices; Economic growths; Mapping systems; News articles; News media; Tokenizing; Crime",,,,,,"Ghosh, R., Siddique, M., (2014) Corruption, Good Governance and Economic Development: Contemporary Analysis and Case Studies.; Huang, J., Lu, J., Ling, C., (2003) Comparing Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and SVM with AUC and Accuracy.; Jang, S., Woo, W., 5W1H: Unified User-Centric Context (2005) Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing.; Malik, D., (2001) Dari Konstruksi Ke Dekonstruksi: Refleksi Atas Pemberitaan Televisi Kita.; Melgar, N., Rossi, M., Smith, T.W., The Perception of Corruption (2010) International Journal of Public Opinion Research, 22 (1), pp. 120-131; Murphy, K.P., (2006) Naive Bayes Classifiers Generative Classifiers, 4701, pp. 1-8; Olteanu, A., Peshterliev, S., Liu, X., Aberer, K., Web Credibility: Features Exploration and Credibility Prediction (2013) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), pp. 557-568; Persson, A., Rothstein, B., Teorell, J., Why Anti Corruption Reforms Fail - Systemic Corruption as a Collective Action Problem (2013) Governance, 26 (3), pp. 449-471; Rahimi, R., Shakeri, H., Reflection on Judicial System's Corruption and Offering Solutions to Promote its Safety (2016) Journal of Politics and Law, 9 (9), p. 187; Rohwer, A., Measuring Corruption: A Comparison between the Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index and the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators (2009) DICE, pp. 42-52; Schrenk, M., (2007) Webbots, Spiders, and Screen Scrapers.; Tala, F., (2003) A Study of Stemming Effects on Information Retrieval in Bahasa Indonesia; Tated, R.R., Ghonge, M.M., A survey on text mining - Techniques and application (2015) International Journal of Research in Advent Technology, 1, pp. 380-385; Uca, N., Ince, H., Sumen, H., The Mediator Effect of Logistics Performance Index on the Relation between Corruption Perception Index and Foreign Trade Volume (2016) European Scientific Journal, 12 (25), pp. 1857-7881; Yang, J.M., Cai, R., Wang, C., Huang, H., Zhang, L., Ma, W.Y., Incorporating Site-Level Knowledge for Incremental Crawling of Web Forums: A List-Wise Strategy (2009) Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1375-1383",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Computing and Applied Informatics, ICCAI 2016","14 December 2016 through 15 December 2016",,127044,17426588,,,,"English","J.

To realize it the system needs to be built which in this study is called the Corruption Early Prevention (CEP) as a Decision Support System for President of the Republic of Indonesia. This study aims to examine 1) how is the construct of the Corruption Early Prevention as a Decision Support System for President of the Republic of Indonesia?, and 2) how is the design form of the system of Corruption Early Prevention as a Decision Support System for President of Republic of Indonesia? The research method is using Neuro-Research which is the collaboration of qualitative and quantitative research methods and the model development of Information Technology (IT). The research found that: 1) the construct of CEP is theoretically feasible, valid and reliable by content to be developed in the context of the prevention of corruption in Indonesia as an early prevention system that diagnoses Indonesia simultaneously and in real time, and 2) the concept of system design and business process of CEP is predicted to be realized in the IT-based program. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Artificial intelligence; Crime; Program diagnostics; Business Process; Design forms; Early warning; Model development; Prevention systems; Quantitative research methods; Real time; research methods; Decision support systems",,,,,,"Akbar, Y., Vukan, V., Explaining corruption: The role of national culture and its implications for international management (2014) Cross Cultural & Strategic Management, pp. 191-218. , (2014); Alexander, R., The role of whistleblowers in the fight against economic crime (2006) Journal of Financial Crime, pp. 131-138. , (2006); Bastin, G., Townsend, P., Whistleblowers - A Legitimate Role in Corporate Life?

Complexicity level of company business processes and the need for information that continuously increasing, gave birth to the information system. An integrated information system is called ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning). The advantages of ERP systems lies in how ERP integrates modules between functional or division. This advantage can be considered as weakness if not properly controlled of how each function is connected, but the company ERP system is difficult to control because of their complexity and high cost of ERP systems management. One of applications that support the ERP system is SAP. The purpose of this paper is to evalute SAP-based material management process at distributor which to determine whether the existing business processes, especially in material management module is still relevant or renewals to get maximum results. The method used in the evaluation is the Fit/Gap Analysis and Risk/Analysis. Fit/Gap Analysis identified a process which goes into a fit condition, gap or partial fit. The results of the Fit/Gap analysis can be concluded that the processes running on the distributor has met the needs of the system because of many processes that have been entered into a fit condition. Risk Analysis was used to identify the activities that go into the gap condition. The evaluation can be a reference for further evaluation in the future. © Research India Publications.","Evaluation; Material management; Process; SAP",,,,,,,"Fidlerová, H.P., Application of material requirements planning as method for enhancement of production logistics in industrial company (2014) Applied Mechanics and Materials, pp. 49-54; Gonzálvez-Gallego, N.M., Using integrated information systems in supply chain management (2015) Enterprise Information Systems, pp. 210-232; Kilic, H.Z., Selecting ""the best"" ERP system for SMEs using a combination of ANP and PROMETHEE methods (2015) Expert Systems with Applications, pp. 2343-2352; Tsai, W.C., Investigation of the mediating effects of IT governance-value delivery on service quality and ERP performance (2015) Enterprise Information Systems, pp. 139-160",,,,"Research India Publications",,,,,09734562,,,,"English","Int.

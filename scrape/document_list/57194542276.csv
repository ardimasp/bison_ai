High permeability of sand caused irrigation inefficient. This research was conducted to find the effect of addition of bentonite and frequency of irrigation to improve qualities of Bermuda grass (Cynodondactylon var evergreen). Experiments using factorial completely randomized design with two treatment factors with 3 replications. The first factor was the addition of bentonite 25 mesh which consisted of three levels i.e. 100% sand, 87.5% sand + 12.5% bentonite, and 75% sand + 25% bentonite. The second factor was the frequency of irrigation which consisted of three levels i.e. every day, every two days, every three days. Results of research showed interaction of media mix and the irrigation frequency was significantly affected all variable of grass qualities. Mix of sand 87.5% + bentonite 12.5% with watering of once every two days produced the best visual quality, and functional quality at the height of grass, clipping dry weight, shoot dry weight, as well as on the efficiency of irrigation water use (EIWU). It is recommended to use mix of sand 87.5% + bentonite 12.5 % with every two days watering that generally produced the best qualities and spends water consumption. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","bentonite; Bermuda Grass; functional quality; irrigation; visual quality","Irrigation; Sand; Value engineering; Water supply; Bermuda Grass; Completely randomized designs; Effect of addition; High permeability; Irrigation frequency; Irrigation water use; Visual qualities; Water consumption; Bentonite",,,,,"Turgeon, A.J., (2005) Turfgrass Management, , 7 (New Jersey: Prentice - Hall Press); Keminski, J.E., Dernoeden, P.H., Bigelew, C.A., Soil amendments and fertilizer source effects on creeping bentgrass establishment, soil microbial activity, thatch, and disease(Article) (2004) HortScience, 39, pp. 620-626; Vaughn, S.F., Dinelli, D., Joshee, N., Vaughan, M.M., Peterson, S.C., Creeping bentgrass growth in sand-based root zones with or without biochar (2015) Scientia Horticultura, 197, pp. 592-596; (1994) Dasar-dasar Ilmu Tanah, , Foth HD ed ED Purbayanti, DR Lukitawati, R Trimulatsih and SAB Hudoyo (Yogyakarta (ID): Gadjah Mada University Press) Terjemahan dari: Fundamentals of Soil Science.

Data collection methods were interviews, observation of the features of the BPN web, check listing and documentation. WebQual method (www.webqual.UK) is used as a framework of this study. Measurement is based on quality function deployment (QFD) to evaluate the quality of a website based on research instruments that can be categorized into three variables, namely: usability, information quality and services interaction. Results show that the evaluation of the information systems of the BPN web to increase user's satisfaction has found some weaknesses.

So, the university can win the competition with other universities in line with increasing the society needs of formal education. The object of this research is one of the universities in Jakarta, Indonesia, whereas the focus is the feature or variable of user friendly and menu to satisfaction variable on the web which supports the teaching and learning process in university. Nowadays, the introduction of E-Learning system prepares student learning material as online access is becoming widespread trend, especially at the university. The research aims to find out user friendly features and menu which is influence learning process on the web at one of university in Jakarta, as a consideration reference for university leader for taking a policy as a way to increase the learning system quality. The method for this research is the use of literature study, questionnaire for lecturer and university students on odd semester 2013/2014 with the use of likert scales shown that university student of variable X1 is neutral or user is satisfied or unsatisfied. Meanwhile, most of X2 variable is neutral, the user said that they were satisfy with D-10 with the score is 1723, and then for the Y variable is the user satisfaction toward web is neutral. The result of questionnaire toward lecturer shown that X1 variable about user friendly is 2 variables are satisfied and 4 variables are neutral or user satisfaction and dissatisfaction toward the web. As for X2 variable about menu shown that 11 variables are satisfied with score above 237, meanwhile 4 variables are neutral with score between 212 until 226. So, it can be conclude that user friendly features are quite influenced user satisfaction on learning process. © 2016 IEEE.","likert scale; literature; menu; user friendly; variable","Education; Information management; Learning systems; Societies and institutions; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Likert scale; literature; menu; User friendly; variable; E-learning",,,,,"Bawaneh, S.S., The effects of blended learning approach on students' performance: Evidence from a computerized accounting course (2011) International Journal of Humanities and Social Science, pp. 63-69; Beaumont, G., Ker, S., (2004) Constructing Usable Web Menus, , Apress; Concannon, F., Flynn, A., Campbell, M., What campusbased students think about the quality and benefits of elearning (2005) British Journal of Educational Technology, pp. 501-512; Dzakiria, H., Don, S.M., Action research on blended learning transformative potential in higher education-learners' perspectives (2012) Business and Management Research, pp. 125-134; Fazlollahtabar, H., Reliability-based dynamic programming for elearning user profile assessment (2012) International Journal of Information and Communication Technology Education, pp. 13-21; Hirzallah, N., An authoring tool for as-in-class e-lectures in elearning systems (2007) American Journal of Applied Sciences; Indriantoro, N., Supomo, B., (2002) Metodologi Penelitian Bisnis:Untuk Akuntansi Dan Manajemen, , Yogyakarta: BPFE; Khalid, S., Mohd, T.M., Hassanah, K., Sanip, S., Aris, M.S., Sharif, K., E-learning readiness among medical educators in UniversitiSainsIslam Malaysia (2014) American Journal of Applied Sciences, pp. 17-23; Stacey, G., Teaching for blended learning: Research perspectives from on-campus and distance students (2007) Education and Information Technologies, pp. 165-174; Thowfeek, M.H., Jaafar, A., Instructors' view about implementation of e-learning system: An analysis based on Hofstede'scultural dimensions (2012) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, pp. 961-967; Diaz, V., Cloud-based technologies: Faculty development, support, and implementation (2011) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 15 (1), pp. 95-102. , Feb; El-Seoud, S., Abou, M., El-Sofany, H.F., Taj-Eddin, I.A.T.F., Nosseir, A., El-Khouly, M.M., Implementation of web-based education in Egypt through cloud computing technologies and its effect on higher education (2013) Higher Education Studies, 3 (3), pp. 62-76; Liao, Jian, Wang, Minhong, Ran, Weijia, Yang, Stephen, J.H., Collaborative cloud: A new model for e-learning (2014) Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 51 (3), pp. 338-351",,,"BINUS Univerity;IEEE Indonesia Section;Wiley","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2016","16 November 2016 through 18 November 2016",,127842,,9781509033522,,,"English","Proc.

To incorporate the syntactic information, Syntactically Enhanced LSA (SELSA) is used, whilst Stanford CoreNLP Natural Language Processing Toolkit is used for the Coreference Resolution. To evaluate the results, we calculate the average absolute difference between the system score and human score for each essay. Based on the results, we can conclude that syntactic information, when combined with Coreference Resolution, do not have higher correlation to human score than LSA (an average absolute difference of 0.15748 as opposed to LSA's 0.12597). But interestingly, the two techniques work better when they are used together, rather than when they are used separately. We also develop a new algorithm to calculate the scores, with a better average absolute difference, which is as high as 0.08969.","Automated essay scoring; Coreference resolution; Syntactically enhanced latent semantic analysis; Word order","Automation; Semantics; Syntactics; Absolute difference; Automated essay scoring; Co-reference resolutions; Latent Semantic Analysis; NAtural language processing; Stanford; Syntactic information; Word orders; Natural language processing systems",,,,,"Landauer, T.K., Foltz, P.W., Laham, D., Introduction to latent semantic analysis (1998) Discourse Processes, 25, pp. 259-284; Kanejiya, D., Kumar, A., Prasad, S., Automatic evaluation of students' answers using syntactically enhanced LSA (2003) Proceedings of the HLT-NAACL 03 Workshop on Building Educational Applications Using Natural Language Processing, 2, pp. 53-60; Miller, T., Essay assessment with latent semantic analysis (2003) Journal of Educational Computing Research, 29 (4), pp. 495-512; Foltz, P.W., Laham, D., Landauer, T.K., Automated essay scoring: Applications to educational technology (1999) Proc. of the ED-MEDIA'99 Conference, , Charlottesville.

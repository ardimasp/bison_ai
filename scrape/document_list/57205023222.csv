Therefore, improvement of business processes, technological reliability (technology), and readiness of human resources (people) is very important to be done continuously in order to provide a perfect educational service for all stakeholders concerned. Because of its online environment, every academic operational activities should be run smoothly so the institution could deliver a high-quality services to every stakeholders related. Some of the activity that needed to be improved in academic operational is the exam preparation and planning process. Since it's still manual, the process of it is still reluctant of human-error and very time-consuming. This study aims to implement business process management (BPM) in the exam preparation process in Operational Section of BINUS Online Learning, BPM framework will be conducted and some of tools are used in the research, such as business process model and notation, process selection matrix, and activity-based costing. Based on findings, online exam application came out as a proposed solution. Cost and time saving estimation by 85.85% and 36.04% are the result if the proposed solution will be developed and implemented. © 2018 IEEE.","activity-based-costing; business process; business process management; business process management framework; online learning business process","Administrative data processing; Computer aided instruction; Cost accounting; Costs; Enterprise resource management; Information management; Activity based costing; Business Process; Business process management; Business process model; Educational services; High quality service; Online learning environment; Operational activity; E-learning",,,,,"Drǎgan, M., Ivana, D., Arba, R., Business process modeling in higher education institutions developing a framework for Total Quality Management at Institutional Level (2014) Procedia Econ.

In 2014, the travel industry is still the king in the e-commerce industry of Indonesia. But there are some things that hinder Indonesian people using e-commerce. Previous research has subjectively contributed to the design and marketing of the online tourism industry, but no one has done an evaluation directly through user perspective assessment. The absence of a theoretical reference model causes significant ambiguity regarding how to create e-travel sites and evaluates them in practice. In this study, it is proposed and validate an evaluation model of the use of e-commerce in tourism derived from previous research theories linked to the risk theory of the Davis’s Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The results obtained from this research indicate that the interest of users of travel booking applications online is influenced by several factors, namely: technology, environment, behavior, and e-lifestyle. The purpose of this research is to understand which factors influence the intention of using tourism booking applications online. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

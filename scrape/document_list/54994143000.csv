The mobile game is called Virtual Tribe. The Virtual Tribe game adopts the Persistent Browser Based Game (PPBG) into a J2ME application, and is combined with a Real Time Coordinating system. The game integrates Bluetooth to GPS connection using a JSR-82 J2ME library, HTTP Connection to server application PHP and online database. The game player acts as a tribal king in the game, and owns a virtual tribe which is located at the real earth coordinate where the player first registered the account. The player has to navigate and manage his virtual tribe and develop his tribe into a stronger and bigger civilization. The competition arises when one tribe decides to invade another's tribe in order to capture more lands. A winning condition included in the game rules, however, is that it is obvious that the biggest tribe will most likely rule the world of virtual tribe. The game has been tested using the Indonesia Internet Exchange (IIX) server, several types of Sonny Ericsson and Nokia mobile phones, and Holux M1000 GPS receiver.","Bluetooth; GPS; GPS receiver; J2ME; Mobile game; Mobile phone","Ericsson; Game players; Game rules; GPS receiver; GPS receivers; Indonesia; Internet Exchange; J2ME; Mobile games; Multiplayers; Online database; Real time; Server applications; Winning conditions; Bluetooth; Computer software; Global positioning system; HTTP; Human computer interaction; IPTV; Mobile phones; Animation",,,,,"(2008) Business, World of Phone - Dunia Ponsel, pp. 24-25. , Telkomsel Priority, Jakarta; (2007) POLL: Aside from Text and Voice Calls, What's the Most Frequent Activity You Do with Your Phone?, , http://www.cnet.com.au/forum/?mode=viewthread&t=10002116&tindex=0, Internet: March. 25, [ December 11, 2007]; (2007) Mobile Game, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_game, Internet: Dec. 13, [December 20, 2007]; Uhlir, K., Kurt Uhlir says the industry's lack of understanding of the complexities of location technology is holding back LBG (2005) Mobile Game Analyst, 3 (8). , http://www.igda.org/mobile/05-04Apr-29_Mobile_Game_Analyst_LBG_Article. pdf, Internet: April 20, April 1, http://www.igda.org/mobile/05-04Apr-29- Mobile-Game-Analyst-LBG-Article.pdf; (2007) Snake, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game), Internet: Dec. 13, [December 20, 2007]; (2008) Wargaming, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargaming, Internet: March 24, [ March 25, 2008]; (2008) Persistent Browser-Based Game, , http://www.pbbg.org/, Internet: March 25; (2008) Cybernations, , http://cybernations.net/, Internet: March 25; (2008) Cybernations Alliances, , http://cybernations.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Alliances, Internet: March 22, [March 25, 2008]; (2008) Java ME Technology API's & Docs, , http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis.jsp, Internet: February 12; (2007) Bluetooth, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bluetooth, Internet: Dec 14, [December 15, 2007]; (2007) Garmin Proprietary NMEA 0183 Sentence Technical, , http://www8.garmin.com/support/pdf/NMEA_0183.pdf, Internet: March [December 17, 2007]; How Does GPS Work?, , http://www.nasm.si.edu/gps.work.html, Internet: [December 16, 2007]","Colondam, S.M.; School of Computer Science, Jl.

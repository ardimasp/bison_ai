The increasing number of social media users becomes an advantage for marketers to create new marketing patterns. This study focuses on the relationship between social media marketing, customer equity and purchase intention. The research was conducted in the mobile phones market in Bandung, Indonesia. The data were collected from the main electronics shopping district in the city of Bandung that has a high purchasing power for branded mobile phones and gadgets. In order to test the validity, reliability and hypothesis, the smartPLS 3.0 program was used. The results show that the significant effect on the three drivers of customer equity is due to social media marketing. In contrast to previous research indicating that from the three customer equity drivers, only value equity has a mediating role between purchase intention and social media marketing. From the three customer equity drivers, only value equity has a significant influence on purchase intention. This research provides theoretical and managerial contributions to the literature. © 2020 Little Lion Scientific.

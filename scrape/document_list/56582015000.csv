In addition to receiving the construction of the auditorium, they also receive other types of development such as school, shop, shopping, and more. Workers are hired workers from outside this office because of the limitations of existing workers in this office. Therefore, they often slow down the construction work with a variety of reasons in order to obtain a larger payment. Also, at the applicant’s development proposal development inaccurate data provided to the applicant’s development, because the calculation is still based on a rough estimate only. The purpose of this thesis is to design a scheduling application program development using the theory of algorithms auditorium taboo search. Program design is done by applying the algorithm to create optimal work schedules through a mathematical approach. Through scheduling, we can calculate the cost of labor required. So that it can calculate the total cost required for development. The method used is the method of analysis and design. After implementation in the existing system, it can be concluded that the application of taboo search algorithm in scheduling the construction of the auditorium can assist decision-making and scheduling to win a development proposal to the applicant building. © 2014 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.","Application; Cost; Development; Scheduling; Taboo search",,,,,,"Alexandrescu, A., (2001) Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied, , Addison-Wesley; Glover, F., Taboo Search: A Tutorial., , http://www.cse.unt.edu/~garlick/teaching/4310/assign/TS%20-%20Tutorial.pdf, Last Access: June 26, 2011; Munir, R., (2010) Discrete Mathematics, , Informatics Bandung; Pressman, R.S., (2010) Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach, , 7th ed., McGraw Hill; Rahardja, W., (2006) Design Patterns Application Program Optimization Laying in Field with Taboo Search Method, , Information Engineering - Mathematics, Bina Nusantara University, Jakarta; Kelvin, R., (2008) Comparison of Genetic Algorithm and Taboo Search for the Traveling Salesman Problem Resolution, , Information Engineering - Mathematics, Bina Nusantara University, Jakarta; Zachariasen, M., Dam, M., (1995) Taboo Search on the Geometric Traveling Salesman Problem, , Department of Computer Science (Diku), University of Copenhagen; Anonymous, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/building, webpage; http://kamus.sabda.org/kamus/penjadwalan",,,,"Pushpa Publishing House",,,,,09720871,,,,"English","Far East J.

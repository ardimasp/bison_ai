Enterprise storage system using full SSD is still very expensive, while hard disk drive (HDD) is still widely used. This study discusses hybrid configuration storage in virtualized server database with benchmark against four hybrid storage configuration for four databases, ORACLE, SQL Server, MySQL and PostgreSQL on Windows Server virtualization. Benchmark using TPC-C and TPC-H to get the best performance of four configurations were tested. The results of this study indicate HDD storage configurations as visual disk drive OS and SSD as visual disk drives database get better performance as on line transaction processing (OLTP) and on line analytical processing (OLAP) database server compared with SSD as visual disk drive OS and HDD as a visual disk drive database. Based on the data research TPC-C, OLTP get best performance at HDD storage configurations as visual disk drive OS and SSD as a visual disk drives database and temporary files. © 2016 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

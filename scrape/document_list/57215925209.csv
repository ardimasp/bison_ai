That is why; transportation is absolutely needed for Indonesian. It also helps the tourism activities in Indonesia. Therefore it is necessary to have a service that provides a one-stop travel solution to accommodate tourism activity in Indonesia that provides end to end services based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). This research method using literature review and observe the phenomenon. The result of this research is the design of a travel information services system that integrates frontend service and backend service using Service Oriented Architecture. The rich picture consists of 13 entities that integrate with each other to build Jalan.com. © 2019 IEEE.","One Stop Travel Solution; Service Oriented Architecture; Transportation; Travel Information System","Architecture; Computer architecture; Information services; Quality of service; Tourism; Transportation; End-to-end service; Front-end services; Literature reviews; One stop; research methods; Tourism activities; Travel information system; Travel services; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,"(2018) The Indonesian Government, , www.bps.go.id; Namjoshi, J., Gupte, A., Service-oriented architecture for cloud-based travel reservation software as a service (2009) IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing; Wang, D., Research on design and realization of soa-based tourism e-commerce system (2017) Revista de la Faculted de Ingenieria U.C.V., 32, pp. 732-736; Li, Y., Xie, H., Zhu, M., Dong, B., Chao, K.M., A collaborative travel service portal with multi-level authentication (2009) Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design 2009.

Most of the food waste comes from expired or unused goods that are not being consumed by the household. According to this condition, the purpose of this study to analyze and design a solution with a food management inventory using a mobile systems platform, that we called Fridger Inventory Management (FIM), which can control every item which is stored inside the fridge. The methodology of this study consists of an analysis process and system design. In the analysis process, focus on analyzing the business environment and collect the requirement with a survey, interview, and reference. In the design process, this study tries to build a model using UML (Unified Modelling Language) diagram, database, and user interface design. The output of the study will provide a solution with the applicable features to minimize the number of food waste. The system features will provide an expiry date reminder, fridge sharing feature that allows the inventory control by more than one user, then the system also provides the cooking recommendation based on what the user has in their fridge. With the implementation of these systems, Fridge users are assisted to manage stock of food effectively and it can reduce food waste with an effective and efficient fridge management system. © 2020 IEEE.","Food waste; Fridge; Inventory management; Mobile application","Food waste; Information management; Inventory control; Modeling languages; Refrigerators; User interfaces; Analysis process; Business environments; Food management; Inventory management; Management systems; Sharing features; UML (unified modelling language); User interface designs; Waste management",,,,,"Tonini, D., Albizzati, P.F., Astrup, T.F., Environmental impacts of food waste: Learnings and challenges from a case study on UK (2018) Waste Manag., 76, pp. 744-766; Chung, S.S., Lo, C.W.H., Local waste management constraints and waste administrators in China (2008) Waste Manag., 28 (2), pp. 272-281; Mostafa, G.M.A., Shazly, M.M., Sherief, W.I., Development of a waste management protocol based on assessment of knowledge and practice of healthcare personnel in surgical departments (2009) Waste Manag., 29 (1), pp. 430-439; Bhuiyan, S.H., A crisis in governance: Urban solid waste management in Bangladesh (2010) Habitat Int., 34 (1), pp. 125-133; Dou, Z., Ferguson, J.D., Galligan, D.T., Kelly, A.M., Finn, S.M., Giegengack, R., Assessing u. s. food wastage and opportunities for reduction (2016) Glob.

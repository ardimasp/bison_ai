People in South Kalimantan usually serve mandai as a side dish, but on this occasion, mandai will be used as a material to make dodol, chewy, sweet, and thick cake which usually made from glutinous rice flour, coconut milk, and palm sugar. This study aims to determine public acceptance of dodol mandai through the distribution of product samples and the distribution of questionnaires regarding its aroma, colour, texture and taste. This research used a descriptive analysis method that is divided into statistical descriptive analysis and frequency analysis. The result shows that the public accepts processed products made from mandai. The products are different from the others and are innovation products based on local wisdom and thus, they add traditional culinary repertoire. The result is as predicted, that mandai can be processed into dodol. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Dodol; Mandai; Product inovation",,,,,,"The authors are grateful to Prof. Bahtiar Saleh Abbas as Director of Research & Technology Transfer Office and Dezie Leonarda Warganegara, as the Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Communication, as well as the Hotel Management Lecturer who provided the facilities required for the preparation of this paper.","Bakar, M.

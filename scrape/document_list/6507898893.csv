At this time, the market has been populated with many mobile apps with similar capabilities, making the competition extremely stringent. The purpose of this research is to obtain a more profound understanding regarding the features of the apps that influence the customers in using the online food delivery services. Thus, the results are of importance for businesses and developers. The results should provide a recommendation for the design and effectiveness of the app. The theoretical framework of the study is established by literature reviews of several existing models. In general, those sources focused on five main attribute factors in the apps, namely, Visual Design, Information Design, Navigation Design, Collaboration Design, and Service Level. Data are collected by using a questionnaire and obtained from a sample of 401 respondents. The data are analyzed by a multivariate linear regression model using SPSS software. The results suggest that those factors are equally important in influencing the Conversion Rate of the customers. © 2020 ICIC International.

Syahdan No. 9, Kemanggisan, Palmerah, Jakarta, 11480, Indonesia","With the adoption of the damage tolerance design principle, the health monitoring system has become an integral part of the operation of engineering structures. For the system to work, a damage indicator that describes the structural integrity level should be established and monitored. The damage indicator is usually derived from structural responses. Many quantities have been proposed for damage indicator including natural frequency, mode shape, curvature, strain energy, and t-, F-, and z-statistics. In this pa-per, we propose a new damage indicator in the time and frequency domains derived from the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. We evaluate the method by using data obtained from a numerical simulation of a cracked beam. The beam deformation is nonlinear due to the contact between the crack faces during vibration. The proposed damage index is estimated in the domains for various observation points on the beam. Besides, the existence of the crack is also predicted by the widely used traditional method based on the change of the natural frequency and mode shape. A comparison is made between the present method and the existing ones. We conclude the present proposal is more sensitive to detect the crack. © 2020 ICIC International.","Damage indicator; Euler-Bernoulli beam; Finite element method; Natural frequency; Structural health monitoring","Continuum mechanics; Damage detection; Damage tolerance; Natural frequencies; Numerical methods; Strain energy; Damage indicator; Damage tolerance designs; Engineering structures; Euler Bernoulli beam theory; Health monitoring system; Observation point; Structural response; Time and frequency domains; Structural health monitoring",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

The research uses simplified structural models to explore the sensitivity of the index to damages, to compare the index performance with a traditional but popular damage detection method, and to understand the local/global predictive capability of the index. The research uses two simple models, namely, single- and two-degree-of-freedom systems. The results suggest that the damage index is local, that can only monitor damages occurring near the points of measurements, but it is sensitive to damages, unlike the natural frequency, which is global but less sensitive. © 2020 Author(s).","Damage Index; General Vibration Method; Mode Shape; Natural Frequency; Structural Health Monitoring",,,,,,,"Xu, Y., Brownjohn, J.M., Hester, D., Enhanced sparse component analysis for operational modal identification of real-life bridge structures (2019) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 116, pp. 585-605; Perez, M.A., Serra-Lopez, R., A frequency domain-based correlation approach for structural assessment and damage identification (2019) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 119, pp. 432-456. , 2019; Chang, C.M., Lin, T.K., Chang, C.W., Applications of neural network models for structural health monitoring based on derived modal properties (2018) Measurement, 129, pp. 457-470; Gunawan, F.E., Improving the reliability of F-statistic method by using linear support vector machine for structural health monitoring (2018) ICIC Express Letters, 12, pp. 1183-1193; Gomes, G.F., De Almeida, F.A., Junqueira, D.M., Da Cunha, S.S., Jr., Ancelotti, A.C., Jr., Optimized damage identification in CFRP plates by reduced mode shapes and GA-ANN methods (2019) Engineering Structures, 181, pp. 111-123; Zhao, R., Yan, R., Chen, Z., Mao, K., Wang, P., Gao, R.X., (2019) TITLE Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 115, pp. 213-237; Khodabandehlou, H., Pekcan, G., Fadali, M.S., (2019) Structural Control and Health Monitoring, 26, p. e2308; Gunawan, F.E., Soewito, B., Surantha, N., Mauritsius, T., One more reason to reject manuscript about machine learning for structural health monitoring (2018) 2018 Indonesian Association for Pattern Recognition International Conference (INAPR)., pp. 62-66. , IEEE, 2018; Zhang, C., Cheng, L., Qiu, Q., Ji, H., Ji, J., Deep learning and its applications to machine health monitoring (2019) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 123, pp. 316-332; Farrar, C.R., Worden, K., (2012) Structural Health Monitoring: A Machine Learning Perspective., , John Wiley & Sons; Kopsaftopoulos, F., Fassois, S., Vibration based health monitoring for a lightweight truss structure: Experimental assessment of several statistical time series methods (2010) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 24, pp. 1977-1997; Kopsaftopoulos, F.P., Fassois, S.D., Scalar and vector time series methods for vibration based damage diagnosis in a scale aircraft skeleton structure (2011) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, 49, pp. 727-756. , 2011; Fassois, S.D., Sakellariou, J.S., Time-series methods for fault detection and identification in vibrating structures (2007) Philosophical Transactions of Royal Society A, 365, pp. 411-448","Gunawan, F.E.; Industrial Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: fgunawan@binus.edu","NahryMarthanty D.R.",,"American Institute of Physics Inc.","16th International Conference on Quality in Research, QiR 2019 - 2019 International Symposium on Advances in Mechanical Engineering, ISAME 2019","22 July 2019 through 24 July 2019",,164750,0094243X,9780735419865,,,"English","AIP Conf.

This research focuses on the reliability of the Power Spectral Density (PSD) method via the use of the F statistic for damage detection. To the author best knowledge, the method is rather classic but its realibility has not been discussed in the context of a large data size. Priory, the research anticipates that the accuracy is a function of the damage level. In this study, we evaluate 3500 cases with five levels of structural integrity, namely, healthy condition and damaged conditions with 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20% damage levels. The dataset is established via a numerical analysis of a seven degree-of-freedom system loaded with a concentrated dynamic force with random magnitude. A spring on the system is reduced in its stiffness to simulate damages. Our significant findings are the following: it is challenging for the PSD-based method to differentiate the healthy condition from the damaged conditions when the damage level is small. However, the reliability is high at 95% probability when the structural integrity has dropped by five percent. © 2020 Author(s).",,,,,,,,"Gunawan, F.E., (2018) ICIC Express Letters, 12, pp. 1183-1193; Gopalakhrishnan, S., Ruzzene, M., Hanagud, S., (2011) Computational Techniques for Structural Health Monitoring., , Springer; Higgins, S., Inspection of steel-tired wheels (1895) Proceedings of New York Railroad; Farrar, C.R., Worden, K., (2012) Structural Health Monitoring: A Machine Learning Perspective, , John Wiley & Sons; Gunawan, F.E., Soewito, B., Surantha, N., Mauritsius, T., One more reason to reject manuscript about machine learning for structural health monitoring (2018) 2018 Indonesian Association for Pattern Recognition International Conference (INAPR), pp. 62-66; Khodabandehlou, H., Pekcan, G., Fadali, M.S., (2019) Structural Control and Health Monitoring, 26, p. e2308; Chang, C.-M., Lin, T.-K., Chang, C.-W., (2018) Measurement, 129, pp. 457-470; Gomes, G.F., De Almeida, F.A., Junqueira, D.M., Da Cunha, S.S., Jr., Ancelotti, A.C., Jr., (2019) Engineering Structures, 181, pp. 111-123; Zhang, C., Cheng, L., Qiu, J., Ji, H., Ji, J., (2019) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 123, pp. 316-332; Fassois, S.D., Sakellariou, J.S., (2007) Philosophical Transactions of Royal Society A, 365, pp. 411-448; Kopsaftopoulos, F., Fassois, S., (2010) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 24, pp. 1977-1997; Kopsaftopoulos, F.P., Fassois, S.D., (2011) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, 49, pp. 727-756; Valverde-Albacete, F.J., Peláez-Moreno, C., (2014) PloS One, 9, p. 84217; Worden, K., Farrar, F.R., Manson, G., Park, G., Proceedings of the royal society of london a: Mathematical (2007) Physical and Engineering Sciences, 463, pp. 1639-1664; Schilling, R.J., Harris, S.L., (2011) Fundamentals of Digital Signal Processing Using MATLAB., , Cengage Learning; Gunawan, F.E., (2016) Inverse Problems in Science and Engineering, 24, pp. 1107-1132; Powers, D.M.W., (2007) Evaluation: From Precision, Recall, and F-factor to ROC, Informedness, Markedness & Correlation, School of Informatics and Engineering, , Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia, Technical Report SIE-07-001; Alamdari, M.M., (2015) Vibration-based Structural Health Monitoring, , PhD thesis, University of Technology, Sydney, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering; Salawu, O., (1997) Engineering Structures, 19, pp. 718-723","Gunawan, F.E.; Industrial Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: fgunawan@binus.edu","NahryMarthanty D.R.",,"American Institute of Physics Inc.","16th International Conference on Quality in Research, QiR 2019 - 2019 International Symposium on Advances in Mechanical Engineering, ISAME 2019","22 July 2019 through 24 July 2019",,164750,0094243X,9780735419865,,,"English","AIP Conf.

For the system to work, damage indicator that describes the structural integrity level should be established and monitored. Damage indicator is usually derived from structural responses. Many quantities have been proposed for damage indicator. Some popular damage indicators are natural frequency, mode shape, curvature, strain energy, and t-, F-, and z-statistics. In this paper, we propose a new damage indicator derived from the theory of the strength of materials. We evaluate the proposal for a case involving damage on a simply-supported beam. The required data are established numerically by the finite element method for structure in healthy and damaged conditions. The results suggest that the current proposal is more sensitive to damage than the natural frequency. © 2020, ICIC International.

Many studies have been conducted to establish the characteristics of such news. This work intends to identify the characteristics that make the news convincing and inuential. To achieve the objective, we relate the fake news characteristics, identified from previous publications, to Klout score, a well-established indicator describing the impacts of news to their audience. A piece of news having a high Klout score is regarded to be inuential. For the current study, the data are collected from Twitter messages containing issues related to politics, business, and entertainment during the period of January-June 2017. A sample of 165 tweets is collected, and then, is identified for the fake news characteristics and Klout score. Finally, a logistic regression function is established relating the characteristics to the Klout score. The results suggest that the fake news characteristics of the use of fake photos/images and the absence of the publishing time are significant factors for the news to reach wider audience. © 2019, ICIC International.

It empirically shows how the driving strategy, such as the braking distance, affects gasoline usage. The movement of vehicles in this work is computed by using the car-following model of the optimal velocity model. For the case of vehicles in a platoon, the model is implemented in an agent-based model. From the dynamic vehicle data, we estimate the fuel consumption by a regression model. We analyze cases involving one, two, and twenty vehicles moving in a platoon for various driving strategies. The result shows that strong braking on high vehicle speed leads to a surge in fuel consumption. The efficient driving condition can be maintained at various speeds given the braking distance is adjusted proportionally with speed. © 2020 ICIC International.","Agent-based modeling; Fuel consumption; Optimal velocity function; Optimal velocity model",,,,,,,"Fontana, G., Galloni, E., Variable valve timing for fuel economy improvement in a small sparkignition engine (2009) Applied Energy, 86 (1), pp. 96-105; Bhoopalam, A.

From the data, we trace the students' gazing points from one word to another word, sentence to sentence. The study involves 30 sophomores and junior students learning materials presented on 52 slides. Some notabled results are the following. Most students gaze to all words on each slide on the first 20 slides only. Afterward, the number of gazed words decreases quickly and linearly with time. In some cases, 50% of students scan the information with improper order, potentially leading to an incorrect understanding.

The ability to predict the level of a pollutant concentration is important for various purposes such as for prevention and mitigation. Some papers had implemented various forecasting techniques to predict air pollution in Mexico, Spain, Malaysia. This research intends to investigate the forecasting accuracy of some air pollutants (PM10, SO2, CO, O3, and NO2) in Jakarta, Indonesia. The data are acquired daily for five measurement sites across the city, namely, Bundaran HI, Kelapa Gading, Jagakarsa, Lubang Buaya, and Kebon Jeruk during January-October of 2018. The data are fitted with Auto-Regressive Moving-Average (ARMA) models. The best model is obtained by comparing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) with the relative error. The best and the most accurate model is the model with the lowest value of AIC or BIC. © 2019, ASERS Publishing House.

In Southeast Asia, Indonesia contributes up to 50% of the e-commerce transactions. During 2016-2017, e-commerce users in the nation increased by 11%. In the past two years, some data suggested that men had done more shopping through e-commerce than women. To understand the issue, we adopt the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model. This model contains seven independent variables, namely, Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Facilitating Condition, Hedonistic Motivation, Price Value, and Habit. The dependent variable is the Behavioral Intention. The model also has three moderating variables, namely, Gender, Age, and Experience. Questionnaires collect the relevant data from a random sample of 218 respondents. Then, the data are used to establish the relationships between the independent and dependent variables statistically, taking into account the Gender as the moderating variable. The findings are of the following. The adopted model of UTAUT2 matches the data at the fitness level of 0.629 in the term of the coefficient determination R2. The statistical analysis supports the conjectures that Behavioral Intention is affected by Performance Expectancy with the statistical significance of t-stat of 3.118 (associated to p-value of 0.002), by Effort Expectancy with t-stat of 3.117 (0.002), by the Price Value with t-stat of 2.358 (0.019), and Habit with t-stat of 12.626 (0.000). The statistics do not support the conjectures that Behavioral Intention is affected by Social Influence, Facilitating Conditions, and Hedonistic Motivation. No evidence about the roles of Gender on the above relationships is found. © 2019 ICIC International.","Behavioral Intention; E-commerce; Gender; Indonesia; UTAUT2",,,,,,,"Hwang, Y., The moderating effects of gender on e-commerce systems adoption factors: An empirical investigation (2010) Computers in Human Behavior, 26 (6), pp. 1753-1760; Lin, X., Featherman, M., Brooks, S.L., Hajli, N., Exploring gender differences in online consumer purchase decision making: An online product presentation perspective (2018) Information Systems Frontiers, pp. 1-15; Cho, H., Jialin, S.K., Influence of gender on internet commerce: An explorative study in Singapore (2008) Journal of Internet Commerce, 7 (1), pp. 95-119; Bae, S., Lee, T., Gender differences in consumers’ perception of online consumer reviews (2011) Electronic Commerce Research, 11 (2), pp. 201-214; Rodgers, S., Harris, M.A., Gender and e-commerce: An exploratory study (2003) Journal of Advertising Research, 43 (3), pp. 322-329; Slyke, C.V., Bélanger, F., Johnson, R.D., Hightower, R., Gender-based differences in consumer e-commerce adoption (2010) Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 26 (1), p. 2; Zhang, K.Z., Cheung, C.M., Lee, M.K., Examining the moderating effect of inconsistent reviews and its gender differences on consumers online shopping decision (2014) International Journal of Information Management, 34 (2), pp. 89-98; Venkatesh, V., Thong, J.Y., Xu, X., Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology: A synthesis and the road ahead (2016) Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 17 (5), pp. 328-376; Faqih, K.M., An empirical analysis of factors predicting the behavioral intention to adopt internet shopping technology among non-shoppers in a developing country context: Does gender matter?

For the system to work, damage indicator that describes the structural integrity level should be established and monitored. Damage indicator is usually derived from structural responses. Many quantities have been proposed for damage indicator. Some popular damage indicators are natural frequency, mode shape, curvature, strain energy, and t-, F-, and z-statistics. In this paper, we propose a new damage indicator derived from the theory of the strength of materials. We evaluate the proposal for a case involving damage on a simply-supported beam. The required data are established numerically by the finite element method for structure in healthy and damaged conditions. The results suggest that the current proposal is more sensitive to damage than the natural frequency. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Natural frequencies; Strain energy; Structural health monitoring; Damage indicator; Damage tolerance designs; Damage-sensitive features; Engineering structures; Health monitoring system; Integral part; Simply supported beams; Structural response; Damage tolerance",,,,,,"You, T., Li, P., Chen, Y., Ye, H., (2012) Journal of Convergence Information Technology, 7 (5), pp. 28-35; Yu, L., Hua Zhu, J., Yu, L., (2013) Advances in Structural Engineering, 16 (1), pp. 207-2017; Moser, P., Moaveni, B., (2013) Experimental Techniques, 37 (1), pp. 15-26; Mohanty, J.R., Verma, B.B., Drk, P., Ray, P.K., (2009) Archives of Computational Materials Science and Surface Engineering, 1, pp. 133-138; Gope, D., Gope, P.C., Thakur, A., Yadav, A., (2015) Applied Soft Computing, 30, pp. 514-528; Alamdari, M.M., Rakotoarivelo, T., Nld, K., (2017) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 87, pp. 384-400; Mehrjoo, M., Khaji, N., Moharrami, H., Bahreininejad, A., (2008) Expert Systems with Applications, 35 (3), pp. 1122-1131; Yu, L., Zhu, J.H., Yu, L.L., (2013) Advances in Structural Engineering, 16 (1), pp. 207-217; Dos Santos, F., Peeters, B., Der Auweraer, H.V., Goes, L., Desmet, W., (2016) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 3, pp. 22-27; De Medeiros, R., Sartorato, M., Vandepitte, D., Tita, V., (2016) Journal of Sound and Vibration, 383, pp. 171-190; Quinones, M.M., Montejo, L.A., Jang, S., (2015) Int J Adv Struct Eng, 7; Pnevmatikos, N.G., Hatzigeorgiou, G.D., (2017) Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering, 15 (1), pp. 227-248; Pedram, M., Esfandiari, A., Khedmati, M.R., (2017) Journal of Sound and Vibration; Gunawan, F.E., (2019) International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 15, pp. 1717-1727; Nick, W., Shelton, J., Asamene, K., Albert, E., (2015) A Study of Supervised Machine Learning Techniques for Structural Health Monitoring Proceedings of the 26th Modern AI and Cognitive Science Conference, 1353, pp. 133-138; Mohanty, J., Verma, B., Ray, P., Parhi, D., (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 38 (10), pp. 12302-12311; Mohanty, J., Verma, B., Ray, P., Parhi, D., (2010) Expert Systems with Applications, 37 (4), pp. 3075-3087; Gunawan, F.E., (2019) ICIC Express Letters, 13, pp. 931-939",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Symposium on Advances and Innovations in Mechanical Engineering, ISAIME 2019","9 October 2019 through 10 October 2019",,155576,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

This paper addresses the reliability of the Power Spectral Density (PSD) method for damage detection. As a vibration-based approach, the method is classic, but its reliability and how the damage level affects the performance have not been discussed. We hypothesize that the accuracy of the method strongly depends on the damage level. We evaluate the reliability by using a large dataset involving 3500 cases with five levels of structural integrity. The dataset is produced by analyzing a seven degree-of-freedom system subjected to a concentrated dynamic force with random magnitude. A spring on the system is reduced in its stiffness to simulate damages. Our significant findings are the following: it is challenging for the PSD-based method to d-ifferentiate the healthy condition from the damaged conditions when the damage level is small. However, the reliability is high at 95% probability when the structural integrity has dropped by five percents. © 2019, ICIC International.","Damage predition; Power spetral density; Reliability; Strutural health monitoring","Damage detection; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Large dataset; Reliability; Spectral density; Structural integrity; Damage level; Damage predition; Degree of freedom; Dynamic forces; Engineering practices; Health monitoring; Power spectral density method; Power spectral density",,,,,,"Gunawan, F.E., Improving the reliability of F-statisti method by using linear support vetor mahine for strutural health monitoring (2018) ICIC Express Letters, 12 (12), pp. 1183-1193; Gopalakhrishnan, S., Ruzzene, M., Hanagud, S., (2011) Computational Techniques for Structural Health Monitoring; Higgins, S., Inspetion of steel-tired wheels (1895) Proc. of New York Railroad; Farrar, C.R., Worden, K., (2012) Structural Health Monitoring: A Machine Learning Perspective, , John Wiley & Sons; Gunawan, F.E., Soewito, B., Surantha, N., Mauritsius, T., One more reason to rejet manu-sript about mahine learning for strutural health monitoring (2018) Indonesian Association for Pattern Recognition International Conference (INAPR), pp. 62-66; Khodabandehlou, H., Pekan, G., Fadali, M.S., Vibration-based strutural ondition assessment using onvolution neural networks (2019) Structural Control and Health Monitoring, 26 (2); Chang, C.-M., Lin, T.-K., Chang, C.-W., Appliations of neural network models for strutural health monitoring based on derived modal properties (2018) Measurement, 129, pp. 457-470; Gomes, G.F., de Almeida, F.A., Junqueira, D.M., da Cunha, S.S., Jr., Anelotti, A.C., Jr., Optimized damage identifiation in CFRP plates by redued mode shapes and GA-ANN methods (2019) Engineering Structures, 181, pp. 111-123; Zhang, C., Cheng, L., Qiu, J., Ji, H., Ji, J., Strutural damage detetions based on a general vibration model identifiation approah (2019) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 123, pp. 316-332; Fassois, S.D., Sakellariou, J.S., Time-series methods for fault detetion and identifiation in vibrating strutures (2007) Philosophical Transactions of Royal Society A, 365, pp. 411-448; Kopsaftopoulos, F.P., Fassois, S.D., Vibration based health monitoring for a lightweight truss struture: Experimental assessment of several statistial time series methods (2010) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 24 (7), pp. 1977-1997; Kopsaftopoulos, F.P., Fassois, S.D., Salar and vetor time series methods for vibration based damage diagnosis in a sale airraft skeleton struture (2011) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, 49, pp. 727-756; Valverde-Albaete, F.J., Peláez-Moreno, C., 100% lassifiation auray onsidered harmful: The normalized information transfer fator explains the auray paradox (2014) Plos One, 9 (1); Worden, K., Farrar, C.R., Manson, G., Park, G., The fundamental axioms of strutural health monitoring (2007) Proc. of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 463 (2082), pp. 1639-1664; Shilling, R.J., Harris, S.L., (2011) Fundamentals of Digital Signal Processing Using MATLAB, , Cengage Learning; Gunawan, F.E., Impat fore reonstrution using the regularized Wiener filter method (2016) Inverse Problems in Science and Engineering, 24 (7), pp. 1107-1132; Powers, D.M.W., (2007) Evaluation: From Precision, Recall, and F-Factor to ROC, Informedness, Markedness & Correlation, Tehnial Report SIE-07-001, , Shool of Informatis and Engineering, Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia; Alamdari, M.M., (2015) Vibration-Based Structural Health Monitoring, , Ph.D. Thesis, University of Tehnology, Sydney; Salawu, O., Detetion of strutural damage through hanges in frequeny: A review (1997) Engineering Structures, 19 (9), pp. 718-723","Gunawan, F.E.; Industrial Engineering Department, Jl.

Syahdan No. 9, Kemanggisan, Palmerah, Jakarta, 11480, Indonesia","Car-following model is a mathematical model that regulates the movement of a vehicle in the longitudinal direction in microscopic level. Commonly, the model describes the vehicle movement as a function of the vehicle relative position and velocity with respect to the leading vehicle. One of the widely used models is the Gazis-Herman-Rothery model, which is characterized by coefficients m and l. The values of the coefficients vary depending on many aspects such as vehicle type and road condition. The coefficients are usually determined from a calibration test where the vehicle position, velocity, and acceleration are measured accurately. So far, a few calibration methods have been proposed; some modern methods are by using remote sensing and RTK G-PS. In the current work, the vehicle movement is recorded in a perspective view from an elevation. The recorded vehicle movement is analyzed for the vehicle position using computer vision methods. Then, the position is transformed to the actual vehicle position. Two computer vision methods are evaluated: multilayer-and Eigen-background-subtraction methods. The proposed method is evaluated to track the movement of a vehicle traveling in a short-straight distance. The results show that the tracking accuracy of the multilayer-background-subtraction method is better than the Eigen-background-subtraction method. The multilayer-background-subtraction method has 96.6% for position accuracy and 88.9% for velocity accuracy, while the Eigen-background-subtraction method has 92.9% for position accuracy and 84.3% for velocity accuracy. The most reliable car following parameters are estimated with 3.2% of error. The obtained parameter m is 0.4 and l is 1.2. Various values of m and l have been proposed by many researchers where the reliable values are in the range of 0-2.7 for m and 0-2.8 for l. Our findings are within the range. © 2019, ICIC International.

For example, the electricity company in Indonesia, PT PLN, sees the high threat especially is fraud that involving information systems. The company, from 2015 to 2018, found many cases of fraud using information systems. PT PLN established an audit team to collect fraud’s digital evidence by implementing computer and mobile forensic that referring to the guidelines of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). The purpose of this study is to measure the comlience level of the audits that have been carried out with the ACPO guidelines. Forensic digital examination and analysis procedures must follow and refer to the basic principles or guidelines (guidelines) internationally, such as the Good Practice Guide issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) so that the examination output in the form of digital findings can be accepted as legal evidence at the trial. The study involves 113 digital evidence from the implementation of computers and mobile forensics at PT PLN. Surveys that refer to ACPO are used to measure complience level in handling 113 evidence with ACPO. The results showed that the average of complience has only reached 51%. In more detail, the proportion of evidence (in %) and the level of ACPO’s complience (in brackets and in %) are: 37 (57), 21 (48), 20 (52), 19 (43), and 2 (24). © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Association of Chief Police Officer; Computer Forensic; Digital evidence; Fraud; Mobile Forensic",,,,,,,"(2012) Standar Internasional Praktik Profesional Audit Internal, , The Institute of Internal Auditors; Pln, P.T., Satuan Pengawasan Intern (2015) Standar Prosedur Audit Khusus, p. 135; Farjamfar, A., Abdullah, M.T., Mahmod, R., Udzir, N.I., A review on mobile device’s digital forensic process models (2014) Research Journal of Applied Sciences, Engineering and Technology, 8 (3), pp. 358-366. , https://doi.org/10.19026/rjaset.8.981; Manendra Sai, D., Prasad, G.K., R, N., Dekka, S., The Forensic Process Analysis of Mobile Device (2015) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technologies, 6 (5), pp. 4847-4850; Meiyanti, R., Perkembangan Digital Forensik (2015) Junal Kajian Ilmial UBJ, 15 (September 2015), pp. 1-7; Nuh Al-Azhar, M., (2012) Digital Forensics Practical Guidelines for Computer Investigation, , Salemba Infotek; Rahman, S., Khan, N.A., Digital Forensics through Application Behavior Analysis (2016) International Journal of Modern Education and Computer Science, 8 (6), pp. 50-56; Alanazi, F., Jones, A., Menon, C., Sharia Law and Digital Forensics in Saudi Arabia (2018) The Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law, 13 (3), pp. 5-19; Román, R.F.M., Mora, N.M.L., Vicuña, J.P.N., Orozco, J.I.P., Digital forensics tools (2016) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 11 (19), pp. 9754-9762; Umar, R., Riadi, I., Zamroni, G.M., Mobile Forensic Tools Evaluation for Digital Crime Investigation (2018) International Journal on Advance Science Engineering Information Technology, 8 (3), pp. 949-955",,,,"Little Lion Scientific",,,,,19928645,,,,"English","J.

The existence of bridge structural health monitoring system is necessary for bridge maintenance due to its ability to process data and provide the information of structural health level. This research is performed to design a deep neural network model for classifying structural integrity with high accuracy. The model requires input data in the form of F-statistic, which is derived from structural vibration data. In the current approach, the vibration data are obtained from numerical analysis by means of the finite element methods. As much as 17.493 vibration cases are generated for five levels of structural integrity, namely, healthy conditions and conditions of 1%, 5%, 10%, 20% damage level. The neural network model consists of one input layer of 20 neurons, six hidden layers with 12 neurons per layer, and one output layer of 5 neurons. The model is trained by using Adam optimizer. The results show that the model is able to accurately classify the structural damage at 83.3% accuracy, and the majority of the false predictions occur in differentiating the healthy structural condition from those of 1% damage. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Artificial Neural Network; Classification Accuracy; Deep Learning; Structural Health Monitoring; Vibration-based",,,,,"Binus University","This research was finished under support from BINUS – NVIDIA Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Center in BINUS University Anggrek Campus, Jakarta, Indonesia.

We use simplified struc- tural models to explore the sensitivity of the index to damages, to compare the index performance with a traditional but popular damage detection method, and to understand the local/global predictive capability of the index. We use two simple models, namely, single- and two-degree-of-freedom systems. The results suggest that the damage index is local, that can only monitor damages occurring near the points of measurements, but it is sensitive to damages, unlike the natural frequency, which is global but less sensitive.

One form of TELs, on-screen learning, has become the topic of interest to many works. It is popular mainly with young people despite all findings, which undoubtedly suggest that it is detrimental to learning. The method hinders learning experience due to the reading spatial instability, difficulties in establishing mental map, and reduced visual ergonomics. Currently, many textbooks are available in electronic form and a majority of the students in Bina Nusantara University in Indonesia, for example, consider the way to be more convenient and preferable. In the electronic form, the textbooks are much more affordable. They are more accessible than the printed books. This work intends to explore a method of improving the learning quality of the electronic textbooks. The improvement is expected to be achieved by enriching the electronic textbook with cues in the form of margin notes, highlights, markers, lines and arrows, and navigation tools provided by the subject matter expert. The method is evaluated on a small class of 18 students at the university, and its effects are assessed. The participants are divided into two groups having the same distribution of the past academic performance where one group is assigned to learn using the recommendation system, and the other is without the system. After the learning, their mentalities are assessed systematically by qualitative and quantitative methods. The participants with the recommendation system outperform those without it significantly, marked by the values of the Cohen’s effect size d larger than 1.20 with the standard deviation about 0.563. © 2019, ICIC International.

In the United States, the disease is the leading cause of death for people of most ethnicities. In Indonesia, the disease contributes 17% of the total mortality. It is also well-known that a regular or continuous monitoring the heart rate is necessary to minimize the fatality. At the current technological state, the monitoring method is expensive and often requires a wearable sensor, which is inconvenient. This study intends to establish a relationship between the heart rate and speech signals empirically by using regression and correlation analysis. The speech signals are analyzed through a frequency analysis using fast Fourier transform. The results suggest that vowel ‘e’ speech signal has a strong correlation to the heart rate. © 2019, ICIC International.

Lecturers in Indonesia often consider that they are underpaid, the existing support systems for research are limited, and academic workloads are excessive. By considering those constraints, we anticipate that the new regulations may alleviate lecturers’ stress level. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the publication obligations on job stress among academic lecturers in Indonesia. We adopt the Job Demand-Control-Support (JDC-S) model that expresses the construct Job Stress and the affecting factors, namely, Job Demand, Job Control, and Job Support. Questionnaires are used to collect the required data for those constructs from a random sample of 100 lecturers in the country. The data are analyzed by using descriptive statistics and multivariate regression analysis, and the findings follow. Those who hold doctoral degree incline to consider the publication demand is low, but for those with master degree, their opinion about the demand spread uniformly from low, average, and high. The participants find it rather hard to control aspects around the responsibility. The supports for publication are considered low, but they do not contribute much in alleviating the stress level. The stress model fits reasonably well to the issue, suggesting Job Demand and Job Control to be the most relevant factors. © 2019 ICIC International","Job control; Job demand; Job stress; Job support; Scientific publication",,,,,,"Figure 4.

One approach to reduce congestion levels is to improve traffic management that regulates and controls the number of vehicles. To evaluate the impact of traffic management before direct implementation on the highway, traffic modeling can be carried out. Parameters in modeling traffic must be determined from a calibration process where the vehicle is accurately measured for its position and speed. This study aims to propose an efficient calibration procedure with accurate results, based on recorded vehicle movement in perspective view. First, the road image is projected using the Direct Linear Transformation (DLT) method, then the vehicle position is detected using the Background Subtraction and tracked using Mixture of Gaussian (MoG) to determine the vehicle speed. Finally, we develop a prototype of Automated Traffic Flow Monitoring based on Python programming. In the experiment results, the accuracy of vehicle position detection is evaluated based on the Euclidean distance. The average difference between the results of position detection with ground-truth is 12.07 pixels with a camera angle 40 °. The percentage of speed measurement accuracy using the DLT projection method is 96.14%. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This work discussed a solution designed to solve common operational project problems, especially in attendance and tasklist management activity in companies who has employee working outside of the office. Considering the number of employees who have to visit various places, conventional attendance system is no longer feasible as be the solution. Similar problem occured in tasklist management, with so many employees to manage in different places will make it difficult for Project Manager to assign task and monitor the progress. Based on the problems, solusion was then designed using SDLC Waterfall using the field research data. This research conclude that by using the proposed application, complexity can be reduced and effectiveness can be improved in performing day-to-day operational task and make sure that they can be monitored. Moreover, the number of employee who responsible to make reports of projects and attendance can be reduced about 50%. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Transfering data from the sensor via the internet network to a monitoring device must be less than 300 ms. One process that can cause non-fulfillment of these requirements is a method for displaying the data on a monitor. There are several methods for delivering data from the sensor to a monitor. This paper has been compared between two methods, namely the polling method and the websocket method. The experiment was conducted to compare these two method. The result obtained that the websocket method was better in presenting real time data compared to the polling method. It can be shown in bandwidth usage and memory usage. In the experiment was found that the average of bandwidth usage is 478KB for polling method, and 91KB for web socket method in web based and the memory consumption of websocket less as much as 16% compared to polling method. In android smartphone the average bandwidth usage is 5.1 KB for web socket method and 15 KB for polling method and the memory consumption of websocket less as much as 22% compared to polling method. © 2019 The Authors.

In this research, we propose a classification method on the basis of the general vibration model. The general vibration model is essentially a set of differential equations describing the dynamics of the structure under consideration. For the purpose of damage detection, a deviation of the general vibration model from the dynamic equilibrium point marks the occurrence of the damage. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we study two simplest dynamical systems consisting of one- and two-concentrated masses subjected to a prescribed dynamic load. The structural damages are introduced artificially by reducing the stiffness of spring in the structures. We find that the general vibration model is more sensitive to damages than the traditional methods. © 2019 The Authors.

For a reason, recently, many attempts have been endured to reduce the emission and to increase fuel efficiency, including vehicle platooning, better driving strategy, and increasing engine efficiency. This study intends to provide a more detail assessment regarding the effects of the driving strategy to fuel consumption. For the purpose, the vehicle dynamics are quantified by employing the car-following model based on the optimal velocity model. The fuel consumption is estimated from the regression model of Ahn18.

At the core of the system lies an algorithm for classification of damages. This work intends to establish such an algorithm. In the current proposal, the algorithm receives data of the probe vehicle rate of rotations, extracts statistics descriptive from the data to produce a feature vector, and finally, feeds the vector to a simple-three-layer neural network to classify the damages. The types of damages are limited to four cases: normal, pothole, speed bump, and expansion joint. For the development, a probe vehicle is used to produce 400 empirical data involving those four damage cases. By using Monte Carlo approach, the established neural network model is evaluated.

Syahdan No. 9, Kemanggisan, Palmerah, Jakarta, 11480, Indonesia","We address the issue of reliability of F-statistic method for predicting the structural integrity on the basis of the vibration data. The method is traditional but to the best of the author's knowledge, its weaknesses and reliability have not been explored. As this work demonstrates, the use of the method often leads to false-positive predictions, where intact structures are predicted to be damaged, and false-negative predictions, where damaged structures are predicted to be intact. We claim the use of the statistic in conjunction with a linear classification model should improve the prediction accuracy. To demonstrate the claim, 17494 examples of data are established from a numerical simulation of a seven-degree-of-freedom model, which is widely studied in the field of structural health monitoring. Then, the data are divided into two groups with the ratio of 70:30 for model development and testing. A linear classification model is established by minimizing a combination of a hinge loss function and a regularization loss function. An optimal regularization parameter is also determined. The present approach is able to increase the classification accuracy by about 10%. © 2018, ICIC International.

The gamification is integrated in some e-learning management systems, and it is expected to increase the students’ satisfaction, motivation, and engagement. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in elearning. For this purpose, an educational website, www.bangsacerdas.com, is established, where the survey is conducted for registered students. There are two parts of participants: the students who are directed to a learning system with gamification and the students who are enrolled in a learning system without gamification. During the process, the level of user engagement and the quality of learning are being evaluated in each group. The t-test results for these two populations suggest that there are significant improvements in the learning experience of the participants in the classes that implement the gamification in their system. © 2018, ICIC International.

To use natural fibers for component of a structural material, the wide scatter in tensile strength must be reduced to a certain level. This research aims to develop a method that can reduce the wide scatter in tensile strength of natural fibers. Pre-screening test was proposed here for one of the methods and the effectiveness was examined using experimental results on tensile strength of virgin and surviving fibers after the pre-screening test. It was indicated that three-parameter lognormal distribution could well characterize the experimental results, and the threshold tensile strength in three-parameter lognormal distribution could be related to allowable stress for strength design. © IAEME Publication","Abaca fiber; Pre-screening test; Three-parameter, lognormal distribution",,,,,,,"Keeler, S.M.K., Mooney, P.J., Advanced high-strength steels application guidelines version 6.0 (2017) WorldAutoSteel; Takahashi, J., Ishikawa, T., Current Japanese activity in CFRTP for industrial application (2013) Proceedings Composites Week @ Leuven And Texcomp-11 Conference, , 16-20 September, Leuven; Ogura, S., Tesuka, H., Yunde, T., Tamura, N., Environmental conservation and energy saving activities in JFE Steel (2014) JFE Technical Report, 19, pp. pp83-pp90; Kočí, V., Loubal, T., LCA of liquid epoxy resin produced based on propylene and on glycerine (2012) Acta Environmentalica Univesitatis Comenianae, 20 (1), pp. pp62-pp67; Das, D.S., Life cycle assessment of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites (2011) International Journal of Life Cycle Assess, 16, pp. pp268-pp282. , 2011; (2014) JCMA, , https://www.carbonfiber.gr.jp/tech/lca.html; Mohammed, L., Ansari, M.N.M., Pua, G., Jawaid, M., Islam, M.S., A review on natural fiber reinforced polymer composite and its applications (2015) International Journal of Polymer Science, pp. pp1-pp15. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/243947; Dabet, A., Homma, H., Homma, H., Suardi, Statistical approach to tensile strength of abaca single fiber (2018) Bulletin of The JSME, Mechanical Engineering Journal, 5 (5), pp. pp1-pp9; Souza, N.C.R., d’Almeida, J.R.M., Tensile, thermal morphological and structural characteristics of abaca (Musa textiles) fibers (2014) Polymers from Renewable Resources, 5 (2), pp. pp47-pp60. , 2014; Summerscales, J., Hall, W., Virk, A.S., A fiber diameter distribution factor (FDDF) for natural fibre composites (2011) Journal of Material Science, 46, pp. pp5876-pp5880; Tacheuchi, K., Tsuchiya, K., On relative accuracy of PWM estimates of normal, and 3-parameter lognormal distributions (1988) Journal of Japan Society of Civil Engineers, 393/ (II-9), pp. pp103-pp112; Aristizabal, R.J., Estimating the parameters of the three-parameter lognormal distribution (2012) FIU Electronic Theses and Dissertations, p. 575. , http://digitalcommons.fiu.edu/etd/575",,,,"IAEME Publication",,,,,09766340,,,,"English","Int.

In this research, applications developed can analyze data from a wide variety of formats, such as in Excel format, txt, shp, and so on. This can be done because the data will be processed first into a standardized form before the display becomes information. Data processing is the process of ETL (Extract Transform Load), process metadata and processes OLAP (Online Analytics Processing). In this research we use a tool or software Pentaho. In addition, to display the information in the diagram we use the Weka stiff and Java script.

The model is particularly important to facilitate the development of the road condition monitoring system. We limit the discussion to the system that utilizes vehicle vibration data to predict the associated road condition. The vibration data are obtained from a probe vehicle running over four road types: a road in a good condition, a road containing a pothole, a road containing a speed bump, and a road containing an expansion joint. The data are then used to extract the vehicle maximum rates of rotations in three directions: pitch, roll, and yaw. This study reports the aspects of the optimum size of the training data, the effects of the number of the neurons in the hidden layer, and the level of the achievable classification accuracy. The results show the optimized model with three neurons on the hidden layer is able to correctly classify damages at 85% accuracy. © 2018, ICIC International.

Many previous studies had demonstrated that the vibration-based technique has potential to detect damages on roads. This research explores the potential use of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for detecting road anomalies based on vehicle accelerometer data. The vehicle is equipped with a smart-phone that has a 3D accelerometer and geo-location sensors. Then, the vehicle is used to scan road network having several road anomalies, such as, potholes, speedbump, and expansion joints. An ANN model consisting of three layers is developed to classify the road anomalies. The first layer is the input layer containing six neurons. The numbers of neurons in the hidden layer is varied between one and ten neurons, and its optimal number is sought numerically. The prediction accuracy of 84.9% is obtained by using three neurons in conjunction with the maximum acceleration data in x, y, and z-axis. The accuracy increases slightly to 86.5%, 85.2%, and 85.9% when the dominant frequencies in x, y, and z-axis, respectively, are taken into account beside the previous data. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Accelerometer; Artificial neural network; Damaged road; Smart-phone; Vibration-based",,,,,,,"Undang-undang Republik Indonesia Nomor 22 Tahun 2009 Tentang Lalu Lintas dan Angkutan Jalan (2009); Jiaqiu, W., Songlin, M., Li, J., Research on automatic identification method of pavement sag deformation (2009) Proc. of the 9th Intl.

The effective use of these AEDs in public places by lay bystanders is important to improve the survival rate. Unfortunately, many people still have limited knowledge about AED and its critical function and lack of willingness to use the device. This research intends to measure the proportion of people in public places who have the knowledge concerning AED device and its use. The relevant data are collected by a survey on a random sample of 400 participants performed at the busiest railway station in Jakarta, Indonesia. The results suggest that almost 65% of them are unaware of the existence of the device in the public places.

The face should be still during the acquisition process; otherwise, the resulted image would be blur and hard for recognition. Enforcing persons to stand still during the process is impractical; extremely likely that recognition should be performed on a blurred image. It is important to understand the relation between the image blur and the recognition accuracy. The ORL Database was used in the study. All images were in PGM format of 92 × 112 pixels from forty different persons, ten images per person. Those images were randomly divided into training and testing datasets with 50-50 ratio. Singular value decomposition was used to extract the features. The images in the testing datasets were artificially blurred to represent a linear motion, and recognition was performed. The blurred images were also filtered using various methods. The accuracy levels of the recognition on the basis of the blurred faces and filtered faces were compared. The performed numerical study suggests that at its best, the image improvement processes are capable to improve the recognition accuracy level by less than five percent. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Face recognition; Image blurring; Laplacian filter; Singular value decomposition",,,,,,,"Chellappa, R., Wilson, C.L., Sirohey, S., Human and machine recognition of faces: A survey (1995) Proceedings of the IEEE, 83, pp. 705-740; Li, S.Z., Jain, A.K., (2005) Handbook of face recognition, , Springer; Heitmeyer, R., Biometric identification promises fast and secure processing of airline passengers (2000) ICAO Journal, 55, pp. 1-6; Turk, M., Pentland, A., Eigenfaces for recognition (1991) Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 3, pp. 71-86; Ji, Y., Lin, T., Zha, H., Mahalanobis distance based non-negative sparse representation for face recognition (2009) International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, pp. 41-46. , IEEE; Ben-Ezra, M., Nayar, S.K., Motion-based motion deblurring (2004) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 26, pp. 689-698; Yadav, M., Omprakas, M., A comparative study for deblurred motion blurred images (2013) International Journal of Emerging Research in Management and Technology, 2, pp. 51-55; Yitzhaky, Y., Mor, A.L.I., Kopeika, N.S., Direct method for restoration of motion-blurred images (1998) JOSAA, 15, pp. 1512-1519; Vageeswaran, P., Mitra, K., Chellappa, R., Blur and illumination robust face recognition via set-theoretic characterization (2013) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 22, pp. 1362-1372; Kalotra, R., Sagar, S.A., A novel algorithm for blurred image restoration in the field of medical imaging (2014) International Journal for Science and Emerging, 17, pp. 21-26; Punnappurath, A., Rajagopalan, A.N., Taheri, S., Chellappa, R., Seetharaman, G., Face recognition across non-uniform motion blur, illumination, and pose (2015) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 24, pp. 2067-2082; Moghaddam, M.E., Jamzad, M., Linear motion blur parameter estimation in noisy images using fuzzy sets and power spectrum (2007) EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing, pp. 1-8; Al-Ameen, Z., Sulong, G., Johar, M.G.M., A comprehensive study on fast image deblurring techniques (2012) International Journal of Advanced Science and Technology, 44, pp. 1-10; Jain, A.K., Ross, A., Pankanti, S., Biometrics: A tool for information security (2006) IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, pp. 125-143; Gupta, G., Algorithm for image processing using improved median filter and comparison of mean, median and improved median filter (2011) International Journal of Soft Computing and Engineering (IJSCE), 1, pp. 304-311; Sakthivel, N., Prabhu, L., Mean-median filtering for impulsive noise removal (2014) 185 International Journal of Basics and Applied Sciences, 2, pp. 47-57; Gonzalez, R.C., Woods, R.E., (2007) Digital Image Processing, , 3rd Edition, Prentice Hall; Wu, J.-L., Chang, C.-F., Chen, C.-S., An adaptive richardson-lucy algorithm for single image deblurring using local extrema filtering (2013) Journal of Applied Science and Engineering, 16, pp. 269-276; Mane, R.V., Kolte, M.T., Implementation of adaptive filtering algorithm for speech signal on fpga (2014) International Journal of Innovative Research in Electrical, Electronics, Instrumentation and Control Engineering, 2, pp. 1160-1164; Kaur, A., Chopra, V., A comparative study and analysis of image restoration techniques using different images formats (2012) International Journal for Science and Emerging Technologies with Latest Trends, 2, pp. 7-14; Gunawan, A.A.S., Prasetyo, R.A., Face Recognition Performance in Facing Pose Variation (2017) CommIT (Communication & Information Technology) Journal, 11 (1), pp. 1-7; Lumentut, J.S., Gunawan, F.E., Diana, Evaluation of Recursive Background Subtraction Algorithms for Real-Time Passenger Counting at Bus Rapid Transit System (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 445-453; Lumentut, J.S., Gunawan, F.E., Atmadja, W., Abbas, B.S., A system for real-time passenger monitoring system for bus rapid transit system (2015) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 9012, pp. 398-407","Gunawan, F.E.; Industrial Engineering Department, Jl.

Because the pervasiveness of the problem scale, it may only be tamed effectively and efficiently by using an automatic grooming conversation detection system. The current study intends to address the issue by using Support Vector Machine and k-nearest neighbors' classifiers. Besides, the study also proposes a low-computational cost classification method, which classifies a conversation using the number of the existing grooming conversation characteristics. All proposed methods are evaluated using 150 textual conversations of which 105 are grooming, and 45 are non-grooming. We identify that grooming conversations possess 17 features of grooming characteristics. The results suggest that the SVM and k-NN can identify grooming conversations at 98.6% and 97.8% of the level of accuracy. Meanwhile, the proposed simple method has 96.8% accuracy. The empirical study also suggests that two among the seventeen characteristics are insignificant for the classification. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Grooming classifier; K-nearest neighbors; Online child grooming; Support vector machine",,,,,,,"Olson, L.N., Daggs, J.L., Ellevold, B.L., Rogers, T.K., Entrapping the innocent: Toward a theory of child sexual predators' luring communication (2007) Communication Theory, 17 (3), pp. 231-251; Whittle, H., Hamilton-Giachritsis, C., Beech, A., Collings, G., A review of online grooming: Characteristics and concerns (2013) Aggression and violent behavior, 18 (1), pp. 62-70; Michalopoulos, D., Mavridis, I., Utilizing document classification for grooming attack recognition (2011) IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC), pp. 864-869; Kontostathis, A., Edwards, L., Leatherman, A., (2010) Text mining and cybercrime, Text Mining: Applications and Theory, , John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Chichester, UK; Mitchell, K.J., Finkelhor, D., Wolak, J., Police posing as juveniles online to catch sex offenders: Is it working?

The design and model are expected to explain the phenomenon for a wide range of loading rates. In this work, a method to measure and quantify debonding strength at various loading rates is proposed. The method is experimentally verified using data obtained from a static test and a pulse-type dynamic test. The proposed method involves the cohesive zone model, which can uniquely be characterized with a few parameters. Since those parameters are difficult to be measured directly, indirect inference is deployed where the parameters are inferred by minimizing discrepancy of mechanical response of a numerical model and that of the experiments. The main finding suggests that the design is easy to be used for the debonding characterization and the numerical model can accurately predict the debonding for the both loading cases. The cohesive strength of the stress-wave case is significantly higher than that of the static case; meanwhile, the cohesive energy is twice larger. © 2018 De Gruyter Open Ltd.

The modern attendance system must integrated with a human resources management and payroll system. Others issues with current attendance system, beside could not control the staff who work outside the office are conventional attendance system that spends a lot of paper and a long process due to be entered manually into the system for processing payroll, while the electronic attendance system with limited device can cause queues at the time employee entry and exit the office building. In this work, we introduce online attendance system on mobile devices and is integrated with the payroll system. It is a system created to overcome some of the limitations that occur in manual or electronic attendance system which is often conventionally used today. We utilized Global Positioning System (GPS), microphone, and fingerprint scanner that available on a smartphone or others mobile devices. We developed our application base on android platform because the android is the most platforms that have been using in the most mobile devices. Using our proposed methodology, the employee can do attendance using their mobile devices and the do not need to be in queue and the employee who work outside the office also can do the attendance. Our research showed that our proposed methodology can used for the next generation absence system. © 2017 IEEE.",,,,,,,,"Tiwana, (1999) Web Security, Digital Press an Imprint of Butterworth-Heinemann; Myers, L., An Exploration of Voice Biometrics (2014) SANS Institute Infosec Reading Room; Pfleeger, C.P., (1997) Security in Computing, , Second edition, Prentice Hall PTR; Woodward, J.D., (2001) Army Biometric Applications: Identifying and Addressing Sociocultural Concerns, RAND; Jyoti, M., Dhiraj, G., Ratna, D., Sainarayanan, G., Reference Threshold Calculation for Biometric Authentication (2014) MECS; Soewito, B., Simanjuntak, E.W.M., Gunawan, I.P., Absence System Using Your Own Device Advanced Science Letters, 21 (4), pp. 638-642; Campbell, J.P., Jr., (1997) Speaker Recognition: A Tutorial, Proceedings of IEEE; Saquib, Z., Salam, N., Nair, R., Pandey, N., Voiceprint Recognition Systems for Remote Authentication-A Survey (2011) International Journal of Hybrid Information Technology; Every, S.V., (2010) Pro Android Media: Developing Graphics, Music, Video, and Rich Media Apps for Smartphones and Tablets, Apress; Allan, A., Biometric Authentication Perspective (2002) Gartner Research, pp. 1-31; Prabhakar, S., Pankanti, S., Jain, A.K., Biometrics Recognition: Security and Privacy Concerns (2003) IEEE Security & Privacy, 1 (2), pp. 33-42; Ashbourn, J., (2000) Biometrics: Advanced Identity Verification: The Complete Guide, p. 201. , Springer-Verlag, London, Springer; On-boarding Manual for Organizations to Install Aadhaar-enabled Biometric Attendance System (2014) Department of Electronics & Information Technology Government of India; Wayman, J.L., Alyea, L., Picking the Best Biometric for Your Applications (2000) National Biometric Test Center Collected Works, National Biometric Test Center: San Jose, pp. 269-275; Mal, R., Sharma, R.K., Kumar, N., Intoxicated Speech Detection using MFCC Feature Extraction and Vector Quantization (2014) International Research Publication House; Kekre, H.B., Bharadi, V.A., Sawant, A.R., Kadam, O., Lanke, P., Lodhiya, R., Speaker recognition using Vector Quantization by MFCC and KMCG clustering algorithm (2012) Communication Information & Computing Technology (ICCICT) 2012 International Conference On, pp. 1-5; Dransfield, R., Human Resource Management (2000) Heinemann Educational Publisher; Bredin, K., (2008) Human Resource Management in Project-Based Organisations.

One form of TELs, that is on-screen learning, has become the topic of interest of many works. It is popular mainly with young people despite all findings, which undoubtedly suggest that it is detrimental to learning. The method hinders learning experience due to the reading spatial instability, difficulties in establishing mental map, and poor visual ergonomics. Currently, many textbooks are available in electronic form and a majority of the students in Bina Nusantara University in Indonesia, for example, consider the form to be more convenient and preferable. In the electronic form, the textbooks are much more affordable. They can be obtained easier than the printed books. This work intends to explore a method of improving the learning quality of the electronic textbooks. The improvement is expected to be achieved by enriching the electronic textbook with cues in the form of margin notes, highlights, markers, lines and arrows, and navigation tools provided by the subject matter expert. The idea is implemented on a class at the university and its effects are assessed. The participants are divided into two groups having the same distribution of the past academic performance where one group is assigned to learn using the recommendation system and the other is without the system. After the learning, their understandings are assessed systematically by qualitative and quantitative methods. The participants with the recommendation system outperform those without significantly, which is marked by the values of the Cohen’s effect size d larger than 1.20 with the standard deviation about 0.563. © 2017 IEEE.",,,,,,,,"Wertsch, J.V., Commentary on: Deliberation with computers: Exploring the distinctive contribution of new technologies to collaborative thinking and learning (2003) International Journal of Educational Research, 39 (8), pp. 899-904. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035504001028, deliberation with computers: exploring the distinctive contribution of new technologies to collaborative thinking and learning; Manouselis, N., Drachsler, H., Vuorikari, R., Hummel, H., Koper, R., Recommender systems in technology enhanced learning (2011) Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 387-415. , Springer; Eklundh, K.S., Problems in achieving a global perspective of the text in computer-based writing (1992) Instructional Science, 21 (1), pp. 73-84; Baccino, T., Pynte, J., Spatial coding and discourse models during text reading (2004) Language and Cognitive Processes, 9, pp. 143-155; Piolat, A., Roussey, J.Y., Thunin, O., Effects of screen presepresent on text reading revising (1997) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 47 (4), pp. 565-589; Mangen, A., Walgermo, B.R., Bronnick, K., Reading linear text on paper versus computer screen: Effects on reading comprehension (2013) International Journal of Educational Research, 58, pp. 61-68; Ackerman, R., Goldsmith, M., Megacognitive regulation of text learning: On screen versus on paper (2011) Journal of Experimental Phsychology: Applied, 17 (1), pp. 18-32; Garland, K.J., Noyes, J.M., Crt monitors: Do they intefere with learning?

This study intends to develop such the capability on the basis of the data of the brain waves: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. For the purpose, a number of participants are asked to participate in the study where their brain waves are recorded by using a low-cost Neurosky Mindwave EEG sensor. In the process, the participants are performing a continuous performance test from which their attention levels are directly measured in the form of the response time in conjunction to those waves. When the response time is much longer than a normal one, the participant attention is assumed to be dropped. A simple k-NN classification method is used with the k = 3. The results are the following. The best detection of the attention drop is achieved when the attention features are extracted from the earliest stage of the brain wave signals. The brain wave signal should be recorded longer than 1 s since the time the stimulus is presented as a short signal leads to a poor categorization. A significant drop in the level of response time is required to provide the brain signal that better predicts the change of the attention. © 2017 IEEE.",,,,,,,,"Bassili, J.N., Emotion recognition: The role of facial movement and the relative importance of upper and lower areas of the face (1979) American Psychological Association, 37 (11), p. 2049; Marouane, S., Najlaa, S., Abderrahim, T., Eddine, E.K., Towards measuring learners concentration in e-learning systems (2015) International Journal of Computer Techniques, 2 (5), pp. 27-29; Hindarto, H., Sumarmo, S., Feature extraction of electroencephalography signals using fast fourier transform (2016) Commit (Communication & Information Technology) Journal, 10 (1), pp. 49-52; Busso, C., Deng, Z., Yildirim, S., Bulut, M., Lee, C.M., Kazemzadeh, A., Lee, S., Narayanan, S., Analysis of emotion recognition using facial expressions, speech and multimodal information (2004) In Proceedings of the 6Th International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces.

It may play a useful role to facilitate discussion and information exchange. However, in our teaching experience, we find many students utilizing Powerpoint slides beyond their traditional functions. Many students fully rely on the slides as the main learning materials and, in some cases, substituting textbooks. This study intends to understand how students interact with the learning materials presented on Powerpoint slides. The interaction is measured using an eye tracker device called the Eye Tribe Tracker. Thirty sophomore and junior students are asked to participate. They are instructed to learn a topic in the subject of Introduction to Algorithm and Programming, a basic course in the computer science field. During the process, their fixation points are monitored and are related to the contents on the slides. The results are rather surprising.

All tracking technologies always rely on GPS that works based on satellite. Unfortunately, GPS can only work outside the building, so that if we need a tracking system to be applied in the building, then we must use another technology. For tracking system in building, there are several technologies. In this paper, we discuss two technologies which are WLAN access point and bluetooth low energy (BLE) as the wireless sensor network. We compare the position accuracy of an object using WLAN access point and BLE. Both the techniques are worthy of comparison because both of them work based on received signal strength indicator. In this paper, we use the smartphone as a receiver. The signal strength will be changed into position with the help of trilateration technique. The experiment results show that WLAN access point is more accurate than using BLE. Use of access point will increase the accuracy or better error about 48% compared to use of BLE. © 2017 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.","Bluetooth low energy (BLE); Wireless LAN; Wireless sensor network",,,,,,,"Chang, X.W., Paige, C.C., An orthogonal transformation algorithm for GPS positioning (2003) Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Journal on Scientific Computing, 24 (5), pp. 1710-1732; Soewito, B., Faahakhododo, I., Gunawan, F.E., Increasing the accuracy of distance measurement between access point and smartphone (2016) The 11th International Conference on Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems (KICSS), Yogyakarta, Indonesia, pp. 1-6; Oguchi, K., Maruta, S., Hanawa, D., Human positioning estimation method using received signal strength indicator (RSSI) in a wireless sensor network (2014) Procedia Computer Science, 34, pp. 126-132; Kim, D.Y., Kim, S.H., Choi, D., Jin, S.H., Accurate indoor proximity zone detection based on time window and frequency with bluetooth low energy (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 56, pp. 88-95; Soewito, B., Ritonga, A.Y.H., Gunawan, F.E., Increasing accuracy of bluetooth low energy for distance measurement applications (2016) The 11th International Conference on Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems (KICSS), Yogyakarta, Indonesia, pp. 1-5; Galvan, C.E., Galvan-Tejada, T.I., Sandoval, E.I., Brena, R., WiFi bluetooth based combined positioning algorithm (2012) Procedia Engineering, 35, pp. 101-108; Huang, A.S., Rudolph, L., (2007) Bluetooth Essentials for Programmers, , 1st ed., Cambridge University Press; Yang, J., Wang, Z., Zhang, X., An iBeacon-based indoor positioning systems for hospitals (2015) International Journal of Smart Home, 9 (7), pp. 161-168; Heydon, R., (2012) Bluetooth Low Energy: The Developer's Handbook, , 1st ed., Prentice Hall; Li, X., Wang, J., Liu, C., A bluetooth/PDR integration algorithm for an indoor positioning system (2015) Sensors, 15 (10), pp. 24862-24885; Müller, P., Piche, R., Statistical trilateration with skew-t errors, international conference on localization and GNSS (ICL-GNSS) (2015) IEEE, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp. 1-6; Wang, X., Bischoff, O., Laur, R., Paul, S., Localization in wireless ad-hoc sensor networks using multilateration with RSSI for logistic applications (2009) Procedia Chemistry, 1 (1), pp. 461-464; Patil, S., Zaveri, M., MDS and trilateration based localization in wireless sensor network (2011) Wireless Sensor Network, 3, pp. 198-208; Kartowisastro, I.H., Local positioning system of a mobile robot: A practical perspective (2006) The 9th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision, Singapore, pp. 1-6; Mikhaylov, K., Simulation of network-level performance for bluetooth low energy (2014) The IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC), pp. 1259-1263. , Washington, DC",,,,"Pushpa Publishing House",,,,,09737006,,,,"English","Far East J.

One form of TELs, that is on-screen learning, has become the topic of interest of many works. It is popular mainly with young people despite all findings, which undoubtedly suggest that it is detrimental to learning. The method hinders learning experience due to the reading spatial instability, difficulties in establishing mental map, and poor visual ergonomics. Currently, many textbooks are available in electronic form and a majority of the students in Bina Nusantara University in Indonesia, for example, consider the form to be more convenient and preferable. In the electronic form, the textbooks are much more affordable. They can be obtained easier than the printed books. This work intends to explore a method of improving the learning quality of the electronic textbooks. The improvement is expected to be achieved by enriching the electronic textbook with cues in the form of margin notes, highlights, markers, lines and arrows, and navigation tools provided by the subject matter expert. The idea is implemented on a class at the university and its effects are assessed. The participants are divided into two groups having the same distribution of the past academic performance where one group is assigned to learn using the recommendation system and the other is without the system. After the learning, their understandings are assessed systematically by qualitative and quantitative methods. The participants with the recommendation system outperform those without significantly, which is marked by the values of the Cohen’s effect size d larger than 1.20 with the standard deviation about 0.563. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The modern attendance system must integrated with a human resources management and payroll system. Others issues with current attendance system, beside could not control the staff who work outside the office are conventional attendance system that spends a lot of paper and a long process due to be entered manually into the system for processing payroll, while the electronic attendance system with limited device can cause queues at the time employee entry and exit the office building. In this work, we introduce online attendance system on mobile devices and is integrated with the payroll system. It is a system created to overcome some of the limitations that occur in manual or electronic attendance system which is often conventionally used today. We utilized Global Positioning System (GPS), microphone, and fingerprint scanner that available on a smartphone or others mobile devices. We developed our application base on android platform because the android is the most platforms that have been using in the most mobile devices. Using our proposed methodology, the employee can do attendance using their mobile devices and the do not need to be in queue and the employee who work outside the office also can do the attendance. Our research showed that our proposed methodology can used for the next generation absence system. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

This study intends to develop such the capability on the basis of the data of the brain waves: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. For the purpose, a number of participants are asked to participate in the study where their brain waves are recorded by using a low-cost Neurosky Mindwave EEG sensor. In the process, the participants are performing a continuous performance test from which their attention levels are directly measured in the form of the response time in conjunction to those waves. When the response time is much longer than a normal one, the participant attention is assumed to be dropped. A simple k-NN classification method is used with the k = 3. The results are the following. The best detection of the attention drop is achieved when the attention features are extracted from the earliest stage of the brain wave signals. The brain wave signal should be recorded longer than 1 s since the time the stimulus is presented as a short signal leads to a poor categorization. A significant drop in the level of response time is required to provide the brain signal that better predicts the change of the attention. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

It may play a useful role to facilitate discussion and information exchange. However, in our teaching experience, we find many students utilizing Powerpoint slides beyond their traditional functions. Many students fully rely on the slides as the main learning materials and, in some cases, substituting textbooks. This study intends to understand how students interact with the learning materials presented on Powerpoint slides. The interaction is measured using an eye tracker device called the Eye Tribe Tracker. Thirty sophomore and junior students are asked to participate. They are instructed to learn a topic in the subject of Introduction to Algorithm and Programming, a basic course in the computer science field. During the process, their fixation points are monitored and are related to the contents on the slides. The results are rather surprising. Many students read the slides in unexpected manners that may compromise their understanding and may lead to inaccurate interpretations. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Because the pervasiveness of the problem scale, it may only be tamed effectively and efficiently by using an automatic grooming conversation detection system. Previously, Pranoto, Gunawan, and Soewito [1] had developed a logistic model for the purpose and the model was able to achieve 95% detection accuracy. The current study intends to address the issue by using Support Vector Machine and fc-nearest neighbors classifiers. In addition, the study also proposes a low-computational cost classification method on the basis of the number of the existing grooming conversation characteristics. All proposed methods are evaluated using 150 conversation texts of which 105 texts are grooming and 45 texts are non-grooming. We identify that grooming conversations possess 17 features of grooming characteristics. The results suggest that the SVM and fc-NN are able to identify grooming conversations at 98.6% and 97.8% of the level of accuracy. Meanwhile, the proposed simple method has 96.8% accuracy. The empirical study also suggests that two among the seventeen characteristics are insignificant for the classification. © 2016 IEEE.","Grooming Classifier; k-nearest Neighbors; Online Child Grooming; Support Vector Machine","Nearest neighbor search; Support vector machines; Classification methods; Computational costs; Detection accuracy; Detection system; Empirical studies; K-nearest neighbors; Nearest neighbors; Online Child Grooming; Computer crime",,,,,,"Pranoto, H., Gunawan, F.E., Soewito, B., Logistic models for classifying online grooming conversation (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 357-365. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915020657; Olson, L.N., Daggs, J.L., Ellevold, B.L., Rogers, T.K., Entrap-ping the innocent: Toward a theory of child sexual predators luring communication (2007) Communication Theory, 17 (3), pp. 231-251; Whittle, H., Hamilton-Giachritsis, C., Beech, A., Collings, G., A review of online grooming: Characteristics and concerns (2013) Aggression and Violent Behavior, 18 (1), pp. 62-70; Soewito, B., Isa, S.M., Digital technology: The effect on connected world to computer ethic and family (2015) CommIT (Communication and Information Technology).

The problem is the strong encryption algorithm is very complex and required intensive computational that need huge power consumption and others resources in mobile devices. Furthermore, people have been using mobile devices to transfer the important information or doing commercial transactions. In this case, security is an important issue to protect the sensitive information, but in the other hand, the portable or mobile devices powered by battery that have limitation in battery lifetime. Choosing the suitable encryption-decryption algorithm to implement in the mobile devices is one of the important decisions to secure exchanging sensitive information with constraining of this source of power. In this research, We evaluate the power consumption of four Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) finalist: RC6, Serpent, Mars, and twofish with respect to the size of file using Joulemeter, PassMark BatteryMon, and Wattch. Our research showed that the Twofish algorithm is the least amount of energy to encrypt the data and the Serpent algorithm is the most need energy to encrypt the data. © 2016 IEEE.","encryption algorithm; mobile; security","Complex networks; Data privacy; Electric batteries; Electric power utilization; Mobile security; Advanced Encryption Standard; Commercial transactions; Decryption algorithm; Encryption algorithms; mobile; security; Sensitive informations; Serpent algorithm; Cryptography",,,,,,"Soewito, B., Marcellinus, Y., Hapsara, M., Secure wireless Ad Hoc networks using zero knowledge proof (2014) Journal Computer Science, 10 (12), pp. 2488-2493; Soewito, B., Vespa, L., Weng, N., Characterizing power and resource consumption of encryption/decryption in portable devices (2008) Region 5 Conference, 2008 IEEE; Anderson, R., Biham, E., Knudsen, L., Serpent: A proposal for the advanced encryption standard (1999) AES Proposal; Rivest, R.L., Robshaw, M., Sidney, R., Yin, V.L., The rc6 block cipher (1998) AES Proposal; Schneier, B., Kelsey, J., Whiting, D., Wagner, D., Hall, C., Ferguson, N., Twofish: A 128-bit block cipher (1998) AES Proposal; Burwick, C., Coppersmith, D., D'Avignon, E., Mars - A candidate cipher for aes (1999) AES Proposal, , IBM Corporation; Brooks, D., Tiwari, V., Martonosi, M., Wattch: A framework for architectural-level power analysis and optimizations (2000) Proc. of ACM ISCA-27, p. 8394. , Vancouver, BC, June; Burger, D., Austin, T.M., (1997) The SimpleScalar Tool Set, Version 2. 0, , Technical Report 1342, Department of Computer Science, University of Wisconsin in Madison, June; Gladman, B., Cryptographic Technology Interests, , http://fp.gladman.plus.com/cryptographytechnology, AES related home page",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","11th International Conference on Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems, KICSS 2016","10 November 2016 through 11 November 2016",,128387,,9781509051304,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

It becomes much more important because human thinking process and behavior are strongly influenced by the emotion. Align with these needs, an expert system that capable of predicting the emotion state would be useful for many practical applications. Based on a speech signal, the system has been widely developed for various languages. This study intends to evaluate to which extent Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features, besides Teager energy feature, derived from Indonesian speech signal relates to four emotional types: happy, sad, angry, and fear. The study utilizes empirical data of nearly 300 speech signals collected from four amateur actors and actresses speaking 15 prescribed Indonesian sentences. Using support vector machine classifier, the empirical findings suggest that the Teager energy, as well as the first coefficient of MFCCs, are a crucial feature and the prediction can achieve the accuracy level of 86%. The accuracy increases quickly with a few initial MFCC features. The fourth and more features have negligible effects on the accuracy. © 2017 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Indonesia speech; Mel frequency cepstral coefficient; Support vector machine; Teager energy",,,,,,,"Frieda, K.K.N., (1993) Moods, Emotion Episodes, and Emotions, , Guilford Press, New York; Chibelushi, C., Bourel, F., (2015) Facial expression recognition: A brief tutorial overview, , http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/CHIBELUSHI1/CCC_FB_FacExprRecCVonline.pdf, retrieved on January (January 2003); Gladwell, P.O.M., (2008) The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes\Captain the Weather Radar Has Helped Us a Lot, , In Success, Outliers: The Story of Success, Little, Brown and Company, New York, United States of America; Galla, T.M., Sapra, A., Panwar, N., Panwar, S., Emotion Recognition from Speech (2013) International Journal of Emerging Technology and advanced engineering, 3 (2), pp. 341-345; Sathe-Pathak, B.V., Panat, A.R., Extraction of Pitch and Formants and its Analysis to Identify Three Different Emotional States of a Person (2012) International Journal of Computer Science, 9 (4), pp. 296-299; Pao, T.L., Chen, Y., Yeh, J.H., Lu, J., Detecting Emotions in Mandarin Speech (2004) ROCLING, pp. 365-373; Kandali, A.B., Routray, A., Basu, T.K., Emotion Recognition from Assamese Speeches using MFCC Features and GMM classifie (2008) TENCON 2008-2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference, IEEE, pp. 1-5; Hamidi, M., Mansoorizade, M., Emotion Recognition from Persian Speech with Neural Network (2012) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence & Applications, 3 (5), p. 107; Lin, Y.L., Wei, G., Speech Emotion Recognition based on HMM and SVM, in: Machine Learning and Cybernetics (2005) Proceedings of 2005 International Conference on.

The performance of such system strongly depends on its feature extraction methods. So far, many extraction methods have independently been studied and proposed, and the three widely adopted methods are Geometric Moment Invariant (GMI), United Moment Invariant (UMI), and Zernike Moment Invariant (ZMI). This study is performed to understand the relative performance of the three methods. For this purpose, the methods, in conjunction with Support Vector Machine classifier with RBF, and PuK kernels, are used to recognize characters taken from Char75K dataset. In addition, the combined features of GMI-UMI, GMI-ZMI, UMI-ZMI, and GMI-UMI-ZMI are also studied. The numerical results suggest the following. Among the three extraction methods, GMI, UMI, and ZMI methods, the latter two methods tend to provide better results by about 7-8% than the GMI method. Generally, when the features are combined, the results improve rather significant, about 7-8% improvement. Only the pair of GMI and UMI combination provide small or negligible improvement. Using the RBF kernel, GMI features alone result in 63% accuracy, UMI features alone 70% accuracy, and GMI-UMI combination result in 72% accuracy. Combination of UMI-ZMI features improve the accuracy significantly than each method along. We also find that the combination of the three methods, GMI-UMI-ZMI, tend to increase the accuracy significantly.

In the United States, the disease is the leading cause of death for people of most ethnicity. In Indonesia, the disease contributes 17% of the total mortality. It is also well-known that a regular or continuous monitoring the heart rate is important to minimize the fatality. At the current technological state, the monitoring method is expensive and often requires wearable sensor, which is inconvenient. This study intends to establish a relationship between the heart rate and speech signals empirically by using a regression and correlation analysis. The speech signals are analyzed through a frequency analysis using fast Fourier transformation. The results suggest that vowel 'e' speech signal has a strong correlation to the heart rate. © 2016 IEEE.","Fast Fourier Transform; Heart Rate; Vowel Speech Signals","Audio signal processing; Fast Fourier transforms; Linguistics; Monitoring; Pathology; Speech; Speech communication; Continuous monitoring; Correlation analysis; Empirical relations; Fast Fourier transformations; Heart rates; Monitoring methods; Speech signals; Strong correlation; Heart",,,,,,"Zennifa, F., Kamil, H., Iramina, K., Prototype early warning system for heart disease detection using android application (2014) The 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC), pp. 3468-3471. , IEEE; Duc, L., (2015) Indonesia: Coronary Heart Disease, , http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/indonesia-coronary-heart-disease, Online.

As the development of information technology and the use of data that increasingly large, it will be a main factor that affects to the company's business. The amount of data that must be processed both at headquarters and other branch offices make the process of data exchange become the main issue in term of speed and delay. Due to data exchange being a top priority in the company, often the WAN network bandwidth used by the file system, email system, proxy, web system becomes peak or full during peak hours thus slowing down accessing file or email system. One method to reduce bandwidth usage is almost full is to use WAN Optimization tools. WAN Optimization has several functions, including Data Streamlining, Transport Streamlining, and Application Streamlining. The purpose of this study is to analyze performance network when WAN optimization was applied in the system. Data is taken from simulated file transfers conducted several days and at different hours. Data were analyzed using Wireshark tools and calculation formula. The results can be seen if there is a significant increasing performance, delay become better from 287 ms to 0.604 ms for file size 93 MB and jitter increased 12.4% better. It can be concluded that with the optimization of WAN, the process of data transfer becomes more efficient both in bandwidth and time during working hours. © 2017 The Authors.

In such cases, the impact forces may inversely be reconstructed on the basis of the associated-induced elastic responses. However, the inverse impact force reconstruction is an ill-posed problem. So far, various methods have been proposed. Many require complex mathematical treatments; thus, they are impractical for experimental engineers. In this article, we adopt the Wiener filter method and introduce a regularization technique so that the method can provide an optimum solution which balances the aspects of the minimum noise and the minimum residual. The proposed method is evaluated using three examples of the impact problems. The evaluation reveals that the regularized Wiener filter method is less sensitive to the regularization parameter unlike many of the existing methods. Therefore, the method is more suitable for practical applications. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Condition number; Conjugate gradient method; Frequency response function; Ill-posed problems; Impact force identification; Numerical regularization; Singular value decomposition; Truncated singular value decomposition; Wiener filter","Conjugate gradient method; Euler equations; Frequency response; Number theory; Numerical methods; Singular value decomposition; Condition numbers; Frequency response functions; Ill posed problem; Impact force identification; numerical regularization; Truncated singular value decomposition; WIENER filters; Inverse problems",,,,,,"Gunawan, F.E., Homma, H., Impact-force estimation by quadratic spline approximation (2008) J.

The most widely used car-following model is the Gazis-Herman-Rothery model, which contains two coefficients: m and l. The coefficients should be determined in calibration tests where the involved vehicles are tracked for their positions, velocities, and accelerations. The existing calibration methods are costly. This study proposes a calibration method using computer vision. Two computer vision algorithms are evaluated, namely, multilayer and Eigen background subtraction. The vehicle movement is tracked on a perspective plane and then is projected to an orthogonal plane. From the verification tests, we determine that the multilayer algorithm has 96.6% accuracy for the vehicle position and 88.9% for the velocity. The Eigen algorithm has 92.9% accuracy for the vehicle position and 84.3% for the velocity. The estimated model coefficients is 0.4 for m and 1.2 for l. These values are within the range of the most reliable coefficients according to many literatures. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.","Car-following model; Computer vision; Micro-simulation; Vehicle tracking","Calibration; Database systems; Multilayers; Tracking (position); Traffic control; Vehicles; Background subtraction; Car following models; Car-following modeling; Computer vision algorithms; Gazis-Herman-Rothery models; Microsimulation; Multilayer algorithms; Vehicle interactions; Computer vision",,,,,,"(2013), http://www.bps.go.id/linkTabelStatis/view/id/1413; Morichi, S., Long-term strategy for transport system in Asian megacities (2005) J.

In the FCD method, the traffic data are collected, manipulated, and transmitted by probe vehicles via a wireless network to a designated server where the data are stored, manipulated, and displayed in conjunction with a digital map. The method is capable to provide near real-time traffic data but its performance strongly and mainly depends on the reliability of the wireless network. In this work, the traffic data transmission strategy in the FCD method is discussed and its effect to the timeliness of the traffic data is described. As the results, it is found that when the data transmission strategy is not properly designed, a delay in a transmitted packet of data directly affects and intensifies the subsequent data transmission. We propose a transmission strategy to minimize the time delay and experimentally demonstrate that the strategy can reduce the time delay significantly. © 2015 IEEE.","Floating car data; intelligent transportation system; normal distribution; probe vehicle; virtual trip line","Data communication systems; Data transfer; Intelligent systems; Normal distribution; Probes; Time delay; Transportation; Vehicle locating systems; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicles; Wireless networks; Data transmission strategies; Floating car data; Information and Communication Technologies; Intelligent transportation systems; Near-real time; Probe vehicles; Transmission strategies; virtual trip line; Intelligent vehicle highway systems",,,,,,"Herrera, J.C., Work, D.B., Herring, R., Ban, X., Jacobson, Q., Bayen, A.M., Evaluation of traffic data obtained via GPS-enabled mobile phones: The mobile century field experiment (2010) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 18 (4), pp. 568-583. , http//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X09001430; Gunawan, F.E., Statistically optimum virtual trip line for real-time traffic monitoring system (2014) International Conference and Advanced Informatics: Concepts, T Heory and Applications (ICAlCTA), pp. 51-56. , Bandung, Indonesia, August 20-21,10. 1109IICAICTA. 2014. 7005914; Gunawan, F.E., Chandra, F.Y., Optimal averaging time for predicting traffic velocity using floating car data technique for advanced traveler information system (2014) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 138, pp. 566-575. , http//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/piilS1877042814041603, the 9th International Conference on Traffic and Transportation Studies (ICTTS 2014); Liu, K., Yamamoto, T., Morikawa, T., Feasibility of using taxi dispatch system as probes for collecting traffic information (2009) Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems, 13 (1), pp. 16-27; Uno, N., Kurauchi, F., Tamura, H., Lida, Y., Using bus probe data for analysis of travel time variability (2009) Intelligent Transportation Systems, 13 (1), pp. 2-15; Fabritiis, C.D., Ragona, R., Valenti, G., Traffic estimation and prediction based on real time floating car data (2008) 11th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems; Jeske, T., Floating car data from smartphones: What google and waze know about you and how hackers can control traffic (2013) Black Hat Conference, , Caesar PalaceLas Vegas, Nevada, July 27-August 1; Yim, Y., Cayford, R., Investigation of vehicles as probes using global positioning system and cellular phone tracking (2000) California PATH Program, , http//escholarship.org/uc/item/0378c1wc.pdf, Institute of Transportation Studies,University of California, Berkeley, California PATH Working Paper UCB-ITS-PW P-2001-9; Gunawan, F.E., Chandra, F.Y., (2014) Real-Time Traffic Monitoring System Using Floating Car Method, , http//www.amazon.comlReal-time-Traffic-Monitoring-System-Floating/dp/3659625175, Lambert Academic Publishing; Campolo, C., Lera, A., Molinaro, A., Paratore, S.Y., Ruggeri, G., Smartcar: An integrated smartphone-based platform to support traffic management applications (2012) First International Workshop on Vehicular Traffic Management for Smart Cities (VTM)",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","16th International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications, ISITIA 2015","20 May 2015 through 21 May 2015",,117126,,9781479977109,,,"English","Int.

However, a long VTL, as well as a short one, may have unintended consequences; thus, the VTL length should be optimized. This article intends to propose a method to establish the optimum length of the VTL. The optimal length of VTL is determined empirically based on the geo-location data collected by ten units of smart-phones. A custom-made application is designed and installed to these devices to track and record the movement of the probe vehicle. The recorded geolocation data are projected to the road GIS line to establish the projection distances. We demonstrate that the distances are distributed approximately following the normal distribution, from which the critical region of the optimum VTL length for a given significance level is established. Finally, we empirically evaluate the method, and demonstrate that for a given VTL length, the empirical probability of the probe vehicle crossing a VTL is close to the theoretical probability. © 2014 IEEE.","Floating car data; intelligent transportation sys-tem; normal distribution; probe vehicle; virtual trip line","Normal distribution; Smartphones; Vehicles; Empirical probabilities; Floating car data; Intelligent transportation; Probe vehicles; Projection distance; Significance levels; Unintended consequences; virtual trip line; Probes",,,,,,"Sanwal, K.K., Walrand, J., Vehicles as probes (1995) Technical Report, University of California, , Berkeley, UCB-ITS-PWP-95-11; Dai, X., A simulation evaluation of a real-time traffic information system using probe vehicles (2003) Intelligent Trans.

Kebon Jeruk Raya No. 27, Jakarta, 11530, Indonesia","Since the beginning of the century, many cities around the world adopt the bus rapid transit (BRT) system to fulfill their need of mass transportation system. The system features with platform-level boarding, bus lanes in the central verge of the road, off-vehicle fare collection, and physically protected busway. So far, these criteria are considered to be the most important aspects with respect to the BRT performance. In this research, we intend to study to what extent the BRT performance may be affected by the interference of the mixed traffic during the BRT operation. We adopt an empirical approach by observing the phenomenon unfolding in the eleven TransJakarta BRT corridors. The TransJakarta BRT operates in the city of Jakarta, the capital of the Republic of Indonesia. We record the travel time data from station to station for the case where the TransJakarta bus can travel smoothly and the case where the traveling bus is interfered with the mixed traffic. For the cases, we evaluate the travel time variation. As the results, we found that the Corridor 1 of TransJakarta BRT has the best performance in term of the travel time variation. For the two directions, the corridor has the mean travel time of 34 min, the standard deviation of 3 min, and the travel time variation of 8%. On this corridor, the mixed-traffic interference is relatively negligible. On the Corridor 7, the two-direction travel times have the mean of 45 min, the standard deviation of 8 min, and the travel time variation of 16%. On the Corridor 9, the twodirection travel times have the mean of 1 hr and 25 min, the standard deviation of 11 min, and the travel time variation of 14%. On the last two corridors, the busways are heavily interfered by the mixed traffic; thus, the end-to-end travel times are significantly uncertain although only very few road segments are interfered. The research leads us to a conclusion that the interference, although only occurs on a road segment, may compromise the end-to-end travel time considerably.","Buffer time index; Bus rapid transit (BRT); Busway; Travel time; Travel time reliability",,,,,,,"Lomax, T., Schrank, D., Turner, S., Margiotta, R., (2003) Selecting travel reliability measures, , Technical report, Texas Transportation Institute and Cambridge Systematics Inc, May; Taylor, R., (2010) 2010 urban congestion trends: Enhancing system reliability with operations, , US Department of Transportation - Federal Highway Administration; Bertini, R.L., Congestion and its extent (2005) Access to Destinations: Rethinking the Transportation Future of our Region, , In D Levinson and K.

The proposed system relies on computer vision technique to monitor the movement of passengers crossing doors on the station. In this work, three background subtraction techniques, namely, Running Gaussian Average, Gaussian Mixture Model, and Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Model, were used to count the passengers crossing an entrance on a BRT station from a pre-recorded motion picture. The results indicates that the tree algorithms are able to identify the passenger crossing with a reasonable high level of recall and but low level of precision. These results indicates that many false positives are identified by the three algorithms. In addition, the empirical data indicate that the three algorithms tend to have better performance with higher value of the learning rate. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Background subtraction; Bus rapid transit; Computer vision; Passenger counting system","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Bus transportation; Buses; Computer vision; Gaussian distribution; Image segmentation; Light rail transit; Transportation; Adaptive Gaussian mixture models; Background subtraction; Background subtraction algorithms; Background subtraction techniques; Bus Rapid Transit; Bus rapid transit systems; Computer vision techniques; Counting system; Rapid transit",,,,,,"Morichi, S., Long-term strategy for transport system in asian megacities (2005) Journal of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies, 6, pp. 1-22; Gunawan, F.E., Koesnandar, E., Pranolo, F.L., Hartono, T., Pangestu, V., Empirical travel time reliability of transjakarta bus rapid transit (2012) Proceeding International Logistics Seminar and Workshop 2012: Competitive Logistics Operation As Key to Success in the Global Economy, pp. 7-11. , Jakarta; Gunawan, F.E., Empirical assessment on factors affecting travel time of bus rapid transit (2015) International Journal of Engineering and Technology, 7 (1), pp. 327-334; Gunawan, F.E., Suharjito, Gunawan, A.A.S., Simulation model for bus rapid transit (2014) EPJ Web of Conferences (Scopus Indexed), 68, p. 00021; Gunawan, F.E., Design and implementation of discrete-event simulation framework for modelling bus rapid transit system (2014) Elsevier Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology (Scopus Indexed), 14 (14), pp. 97-110. , 4; Campo, C., (2010) Bus Rapid Transit: Theory and Practice in the United States and Abroad, , http://hdl.handle.net/1853/37089, Master's thesis; School of civil and environmental engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology; Yunita, R., (2008) Busway for Jakarta: A Pressing Need, , AsiaViews; AsiaViews; Gunawan, F.E., Chandra, F.Y., Optimal averaging time for predicting tra-c velocity using floating car data technique for advanced traveler information system (2014) Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 138, pp. 566-575. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042814041603, doi:http://dx.d oi.org/10.1016/j.sbsp ro.2014.07.240; the 9th International Conference on Traffic and Transportation Studies (ICTTS 2014); Gunawan, F.E., Chandra, F.Y., (2014) Real-time Traffc Monitoring System Using Floating Car Method, , LAP Lambert Academic Publishing; Gunawan, F.E., Chandra, F.Y., Optimal averaging time for predicting traffic velocity using floating car data technique for advanced traveler information system (2014) Procedia - Social and Behavioural Sciences, 138, pp. 566-575. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042814041603, doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.07.240; Gunawan, F.E., Abbas, B.S., Atmadja, W., Chandra, F.Y., Agung, A.A., Kusnandar, E., Ergodicity of traffc flow with constant penetration rate for traffic monitoring via floating vehicle technique (2014) EPJ Web of Conferences, 68, p. 00020. , http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84901428304&partnerID=40&md5=4ec9707fb351b9126eb1b2826b15cb5f; Lumentut, J., Gunawan, F.E., Atmadja, W., Abbas, B.S., A system for real-time passenger monitoring system for bus rapid transit system (2015) 7th Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems (ACIIDS), , Bali, Indonesia; Kang, H., Kim, D., (2005) Real-time Multiple Tracking Using Competitive Condensation.

This work is important for a number of reasons: the increasing number of the Internet users across the globe, the increasing number of social media, increasing in the number and types of crime on the Internet, and the crime of sexual abuse in children impacts both physically and physiologically. Online grooming is the most reported suspected Internet activities in 2009-2010 according to Child Exploitation and Online Protection, which is a part of the UK's Home Office Serious Organized Crime agency. Around 160 online script conversations are analyzed to determine characteristics of a grooming conversation. Those scripts are obtained randomly from http://www.perverted-justice.com and www.literotika.com. The characteristics are divided into 20 types. The scripts are divided into two sets: 100 scripts for the training set and 59 scripts for the testing set. As the results, five most relevant grooming characteristics are identified from the paired t-test, and a logistic model is established on this basis. The model is evaluated using the testing data set, and the results show that the model has relatively good performance with 95% accuracy, 96% true positive, 4% false positive, 93% true negative, and 7% false negative. © 2015 The Authors.

At the moment we have an accident that we may be difficult, even we cannot contact police or rescue ambulance. In addition we do not know their phone number or perhaps circumstances we were so severe that we cannot dial the rescue or police phone number. In this paper, we introduce a system that can generate alerts or contact rescuers and police automatically when we are faced with a situation that is undesirable. The system will utilize the accelerometer sensor in the mobile devices (smart phone). We proposed fall detection algorithm which use accelerometer to generate a signal. Our result shows that the false positive is about 30% if someone fall down with the smart phone in the pocket, and about 1.5% if we drop the smart phone. © 2015 The Authors.

However, the success or failure of this system will depend on many variables such as service planning, infrastructure, station design, passenger information systems, and integration and access. In this work, we established a computational framework on the basis of the discrete-event system for modeling the bus rapid transit system. This particular development allowed us to cost-effectively evaluate the effects of some of those variables on BRT performance. The results were a few sub-systems that could directly be used to model a typical BRT system. Some limited numerical trials revealed that the developed sub-systems could reasonably reproduce phenomena commonly observed in an actual BRT system. ©, 2014, Science Press.

Science, Bina Nusantara University, Jl KH Syahdan 9, Jakarta, 11480, Indonesia","Despite the concern of privacy, the method of Floating Car Data (FCD) is clearly one of the cheapest methods to provide real-time or near real-time traffic information. The method has become more affordable with the proliferation of smart-phones and with the existing infrastructure of the wireless network. In conjunction with the virtual trip lines (VTL), the FCD method can mimic the traditional traffic monitoring method on the basis of loop detectors. In addition, the use of VTL also helps the FCD method in preventing the potential of tracking the probe vehicle, which is used to gather and report the traffic information. Although vast publications regarding the FCD method are available, the issues of the optimal length of the VTL, the timeliness of the data, and the accuracy of the geo-location data have not been discussed. This article focuses and addresses these issues empirically using data collected by a probe vehicle traveling along Jakarta Inner Road Highway in Jakarta, Indonesia. Those data are collected using ten smart-phones of the same type. As the result, the optimal trip line length can be established as a function of the level of accuracy of the geo-location data. In the case where the level of accuracy is 32 m, we determine a VTL length of 26 m should provide 95% chance that the probe vehicle will cross the line. In addition, the currently developed system can also provide about 80% of the traffic data in less than 1 min, and the remaining 20% data within 1-5 min interval. Finally, by applying a simple moving average filter, the prediction of the traffic velocity can be increased significantly, and the geo-location data error can be reduced up to 20%. © 2014 IEEE.","Advanced Traveler Information System; Floating Car Data; Global Positioning System; Intelligent Transportation Systems","Global positioning system; Intelligent systems; Probes; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Traffic control; Floating car data; Intelligent transportation systems; Moving average filter; Probe vehicles; Real-time traffic datum; Real-time traffic information; Traffic information; Traffic monitoring; Advanced traveler information systems",,,,,,"Arnott, R., Does providing information to drivers reduce traffic congestion?

Building an efficient mass transportation system is clearly necessary. However, implementing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have also been demonstrated effective in various advanced countries. Recently, the floating vehicle technique (FVT), an ITS implementation, has become cost effective to provide real-time traffic information with proliferation of the smartphones. Although many publications have discussed various issues related to the technique, none of them elaborates the discrepancy of a single floating car data (FCD) and the associated fleet data. This work addresses the issue based on an analysis of Sugiyama et al's experimental data. The results indicate that there is an optimum averaging time interval such that the estimated velocity by the FVT reasonably representing the traffic velocity. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,,"Morichi, S., (2005) Journal of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies, 6, p. 1; Nelson, J.D., Blundell, S., Pettitt, P., Thompson, S., (2001) Transport Review, 21, p. 51; Toshitaka, M., (2007) Japan ITS Handbook 2006-2007, , Highway industry development organization; Chen, K., Miles, J.C., (1999) ITS Handbook 2000: Recommendations from the World Road Association (PIARC), , Artech House; Sanwal, K.K., Walrand, J., (1995) California PATH Working Paper UCB-ITS-PWP-95-11, , Tech. rep., University of California, Berkeley; Cathey, F., Dailey, D., Transit vehicles as traffic probe sensors (2001) Proceedings IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems, pp. 579-584; Dai, X., Ferman, M., Roesser, R., A simulation evaluation of a real-time traffic information system using probe vehicles (2003) Intelligent Transportation Systems, 2003, Proceedings. 2003 IEEE, 1; Fabritiis, C.D., Ragona, R., Valenti, G., Traffic estimation and prediction based on real time floating car data (2008) 11th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems; Uno, N., Kurauchi, F., Tamura, H., Iida, Y., (2009) Intelligent Transportation Systems, 13 (2); Liu, K., Yamamoto, T., Morikawa, T., (2009) Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems, 13, p. 16; Herrera, J.C., Work, D.B., Herring, R., Ban, X., Jacobson, Q., Bayen, A.M., (2010) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 18, p. 568; Campolo, C., Iera, A., Molinaro, A., Paratore, S.Y., Ruggeri, G., SMaRTCaR: An integrated smartphone-based platform to support traffic management applications (2012) First International Workshop on Vehicular Traffic Management for Smart Cities (VTM); Jenelius, E., Koutsopoulos, H.N., (2013) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 53, p. 64; Rahmani, M., Koutsopoulos, H.N., (2013) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 30, p. 41; Sugiyama, Y., Fukui, M., Kikuchi, M., Hasebe, K., Nakayama, A., Nishinari, K., Ichi Tadaki, S., Yukawa, S., (2008) New Journal of Physics, 10, p. 033001; De Boor, C., (2001) A Practical Guide to Splines, , Springer Verlag; De Lillo, F., Cecconi, F., Lacorata, G., Vulpiani, A., (2008) EPL, 84; De Luca, L.T., (2009) Propulsion Physics, , (EDP Sciences, Les Ulis","Gunawan, F.E.; Bina Nusantara University, 11480 Jakarta, Indonesia; email: fgunawan@binus.edu",,"","EDP Sciences","2013 International Conference on Advances Science and Contemporary Engineering, ICASCE 2013","23 October 2013 through 24 October 2013","Jakarta",,21016275,,,,"English","EPJ Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901428304

This particular problem is interesting because the impact-force particularly those of the pulse-type are difficult to be measured directly. In the present approach, the necessity of regularization is enforced by means of the trust region approach. This study mainly contributes a systematic approach to locate the optimal solution by tracking the Levenberg-Marquardt parameter. The proposed method is evaluated by solving two typical problem existed in the inverse problem of the impact-force reconstruction.

The time domain of the simulation spans the airbag inflation stage, the stabilization stage, and the impact stage. Therefore, this particular model allows a user to further develop an optimum airbag according to the fragility level of the intended product by varying not only geometry of the airbag but also the gas properties and its pressure. Furthermore, the paper also shows a comparison of the model results to those of experimental data.

An essential feature differentiating those models is that the traditional Gazis-Herman-Rothery model only governs the vehicle dynamics in the car-following state, but the other two models encompass larger interaction state including the free-flow state and the acceleration from the vehicle initial state. From this study, it can be concluded; (i) the optimal velocity model and intelligent driver model are more complete than the traditional model; (ii) the existing optimal velocity model may produce an unrealistic vehicle interaction; (iii) the optimal velocity model with a realistic delay can produce a stable interaction, and (iv) the intelligent driver model still needs further development particularly to take into account the driver delay which is an important aspect in the traffic dynamics on the microscopic level, and finally, (v) those three models may produce similar dynamics characteristics.","Car-following model; Intelligent driver model; Intelligent transportation; Micro-simulation; Optimal velocity model","Car-following models; Intelligent driver models; Intelligent transportation; Microsimulation; Optimal velocity model; Dynamics; Traffic control; Vehicles; Computer simulation",,,,,,"Pipes, L.A., An operational analysis of traffic dynamics (1953) Journal of Applied Physics, 24 (3), pp. 274-281; Brackstone, M., McDonald, M., Car-following: A historical review (1999) Transportation Research Part F, 2 (4), pp. 181-196; Gazis, D.C., Herman, R., Rothery, R.W., Non-linear follow-the-leader models of traffic flow (1961) Operations Research, 4 (9), pp. 545-567; Seddon, P.A., A program for simulating the dispersion of platoons of road traffic (1972) Simulation, 18 (3), pp. 81-90; Ahmed, K.I., Modeling drivers' acceleration and Lane Changing behavior (1999) Doctor of Science, , Massachusetts Institute of Technology, February; Maerivoet, S., Modelling traffic on motorways: state-of-the-art, numerical data analysis, and dynamic traffic assignment (2006), Departement elektrotechniek Esat-SCD (SISTA), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, June; Aron, M., Car following in an urban network; simulation and experiments (1988) Proceedings of Seminar D of 16th PTRC Meeting, pp. 27-39; Ozaki, H., Reaction and anticipation in the car-following behavior (1993) Proceedings of the 12th International Symposium on the Theory of Traffic Flow and Transportation, pp. 349-366. , Daganzo C F (Ed.), Elsevier, New-York; Treiber, M., Hennecke, A., Helbing, D., Congested traffic states in empirical observations and microscopic simulations Rev.

The procedure requires two measured data: the applied impact-force and the structural elastic response at a point, and further assumes the material viscoelasticity following the Prony series expansion. In this procedure, we infer the viscoelastic material constants in the following steps: we initialize the viscoelastic material constants, and then calculate the stress state at the point, and finally, we check the equilibrium of the constitute equation. The procedure is repeated until the equilibrium of the constitute equation is satisfied. In this repetition, the viscoelastic material constants are updated following the Gauss-Newton method. In addition, we evaluated the method by using data obtained from a simulated impact on a viscoelastic plate, and the results were rather promising. Finally, we studied the convergence of the procedure using various random material constants as the input data.","Finite element method; Inverse-problem; Stress-wave; Visco-elasticity",,,,,,,"(2008) ABAQUS Analysis User's Manual, , Abaqus, Version 6.8; Anderson, S.P., Higher-order rod approximations for the propagation of longitudinal stress waves in elastic bars (2006) Journal Sound and Vibration, 290, pp. 290-308; Aoki, S., Amaya, K., Sahashi, M., Nakamura, T., Identification of gurson's material constants by using Kalman filter (1997) Computational Mechanics, 19 (6), pp. 501-506; Araujo, A.L., Soares, C.M.M., Soares, C.A.M., Herskovits, J., Characterisation by inverse techniques of elastic, viscoelastic and piezoelectric properties of anisotropic sandwich adaptive structure (2010) Applied Composite Materials, 17, pp. 543-556; Barkanov, E., Skukis, E., Petitjean, B., Characterisation of viscoelastic layers in sandwich panels via an inverse technique (2009) Journal of Sound and Vibration, 327, pp. 402-412; Baumgaertel, M., Winter, H., Determination of discrete relaxation and retardation time spectra from dynamics mechanical data (1989) Rheological Acta, 28, pp. 511-519; Benatar, A., Rittel, D., Yarin, A., Theoretical and experimental analysis of longitudinal wave propagation in cylindrical viscoelastic rods (2003) J. of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 51, pp. 1413-1431; Blanc, R.H., Transient wave propagation methods for determining the viscoelastic properties of solids (1993) Journal of Applied Mechanics, 60, pp. 763-768; Brigham, E.O., (1974) The Fast Fourier Transform, , Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey; Casem, D.T., Fourney, W., Chang, P., Wave separation in viscoelastic pressure bars using single-point measurements of strain and velocity (2003) Polymer Testing, 22, pp. 155-164; Casimir, J.B., Vinh, T., Measuring the complex moduli of materials by using the double pendulum system (2012) Journal of Sound and Vibration, 331, pp. 1342-1354; Christensen, R.M., (1981) Theory of Viscoelasticity, , Academic Press, New York, 2nd edition; Doyle, J.F., (1989) Wave Propagation In Structures: An FFT-based Spectral Analysis Methodology, , Springer-Verlag, New York; Drozdiv, A.D., Dorfmann, A., The nonlinear viscoelastic response of carbon black-filled natural rubbers (2002) International Journal of Solids and Structures, 39, pp. 5699-5717; Emri, I., Tschoegl, N.W., Generating line spectra from experimental responses.part I:Relaxation modulus and creep compliance (1993) Rheologica Acta, 32, pp. 311-321; Emri, I., Tschoegl, N.W., Generating line spectra from experimental responses.part IV:Application to experimental data (1994) Rheological Acta, 33, pp. 60-70; Emri, I., Tschoegl, N.W., Determination of mechanical spectra from experimental responses (1995) International Journals of Solids and Structures, 32, pp. 817-826; Emri, I., Tschoegl, N.W., Generating line spectra from experimental responses.part V:Time-dependent viscocity (1997) Rheologica Acta, 36, pp. 303-306; Flugge, W., (1975) Viscoelasticity, , Springer-Verlag, second revised edition; Graff, K.F., (1975) Wave Motion In Elastic Solids, , Ohio State University Press; Gunawan, F.E., Homma, H., Kanto, Y., Two-step b-splines regularization method for solving an ill-posed problem of impact-force reconstruction (2006) Journal of Sound Vibration, 297, pp. 200-214. , doi: 10.1016/j.jsv.2006.03.036; Hillstrom, L., Mossberg, M., Lundberg, B., Identification of complex modulus from measured strains on an axially impacted bar using least squares (2000) Journal of Sound and Vibration, 230 (3), pp. 689-707; Hilton, H.H., Beldica, C.E., Greffe, C., (2004) The Relation of Experimentally Generated Wave Shapes to Viscoelastic Material Characterizations-analytical and Computational Simulations, , http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Divisions/Communities/CSM/publications/2001/ASC.01.pdf, Retrieved on December 15, 2004; Ju, B.F., Liu, K.K., Characterizing viscoelastic properties of thin elastometic membrane (2002) Mechanics of Materials, 34, pp. 485-491; Kim, S.Y., Lee, D.H., Identification of fractional-derivative-model parameters of viscoelastic materials from measured FRFs (2009) Journal of Sound and Vibration, 324, pp. 570-586; Kohnke, P., (1999) ANSYS Theory Reference, , ANSYS, Inc., eleventh edition; release 5.6 edition.

The established numerical model is used to study the propagation mode of the debonding, and the result suggests that in this particular specimen design and loading condition, the debonding initiated in a mixed mode condition.

The fiber fracture possess the greatest threat the structure integrity. However, the progressive debonding often increases the load sustained by the fiber; therefore, it may promote the fiber fracture. It is clear that data of the debonding strength are crucial. Unfortunately, the experiment for the purpose is often difficult particularly in a high-strain rate case. In this paper, we present an experimental technique to obtain the mechanical properties of the debonding in the high-strain rate case. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Cohesize zone model; Dynamic debonding; Finite element analysis; Fracture mechanics","Buckling; Debonding; Dynamics; Failure (mechanical); Fibers; Finite element method; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Laminated composites; Strain; Debonding strength; Experimental techniques; Fiber fracture; Fiberglass composites; High strain rates; Matrix cracking; Structure integrity; Zone model; Strain rate",,,,,,"Favre, J.-P., Merienne, M.-C., Characterization of fibre/resin bonding in composites using a pull-out test (1981) International Journal of Adhesion and Adhesives, 1 (6), pp. 311-316. , http://dx.doi.org/DOI:10.1016/0143-7496(81)90025-7; Wells, J.K., Beaumont, P.W.R., Debonding and pull-out processes in fibrous composites (1985) J. of Mat.

[1]. The model is based on a strain-energy function incorporating only a few physical-based material parameters. The main focus of their approach is on the modeling of the response of the cross-bridge interactions and on the related force generation. Based on a one-dimensional analysis the performance of the modeling approach has been shown by comparing to experimental data of smooth muscle cells. The results of the combined coupled model are broadly consistent with isometric and quick-release experiments on smooth muscle tissue. In the present study the aforementioned model has been implemented into a finite element program in order to solve more complex boundary-value problems. In doing so we present here a first three-dimensional simulation of the Fick's law-driven diffusion of calcium into a cell as well as the related smooth muscle contraction. © CIMNE.","3D mechanical modeling; Calcium; Smooth muscle contraction","3D-finite element analysis; Coupled models; Cross-bridge; Experimental data; Finite element programs; Force generation; Material parameter; Mechanical modeling; Mechanochemicals; Modeling approach; One-dimensional analysis; Smooth muscle cells; Smooth muscle contraction; Smooth muscles; Strain energy functions; Three dimensional simulations; Calcium; Cells; Finite element method; Muscle; Plasticity; Three dimensional computer graphics; Three dimensional",,,,,,"Murtada, S.-I., Kroon, M., Holzapfel, G.A., (2009) A Calcium-driven Mechanochemical Model for Prediction of Force Generation in Smooth Muscle, , submitted; Arner, A., Mechanical characteristics of chemically skinning guinea-pig taenia coli (1982) European Journal of Physiology, 395, pp. 277-284; Hai, C.M., Murphy, R.A., Ross-bridge phosphorylation and regulation of latch state in smooth muscle (1988) American Journal of Physiology.

The difficulty of the problem lies on determination of the impulse response function that relates the elastic response to a unit applied impact force which is numerically ill-posed. Two iterative numerical regularization schemes are proposed, first is a time-domain regularization based on the conjugate-gradient method and second is a frequency-domain regularization based on an optimal filter approach. Both schemes are evaluated by using the data obtained from an impact experiment. The result shows that the estimation error is about 18.0%.","Conjugate-gradient; Inverse problem; One-point bend specimen; Optimal filter","Elasticity; Frequency domain analysis; Inverse problems; Iterative methods; Conjugate-gradient; One-point bend specimen; Optimal filter; Bending (deformation)",,,,,,"Rubio, L., Det. of dyn. fracture-initiation toughness using three-point bending tests in a modified hopkinson pres. bar (2003) Exp.

The intrinsic regularization of the conjugate gradient method along iteration makes the method superior for solving an ill-posed problem. The solutions along iteration converge fast to an optimal solution. If the termination criterion is not satisfied, the solution will diverge to a solution which dominated by the noise. Reformulation of an ill-posed problem as an eigenvalue formulation gives a very convenient formula since it is possible to estimate an optimal regularization parameter and an optimal solution at once. For very large problems, the fast Fourier transformation could be implemented in the circulant matrix-vector multiplication. The developed method is applied to some inverse problems of elasto-dynamic and the accurate estimation was achieved.","CG-TLS method; Inverse analysis; Iterative solution; Tikhonov regularization","Convergence of numerical methods; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Fourier transforms; Iterative methods; Matrix algebra; Problem solving; Vectors; Elasto-dynamics; Ill-posed problems; Inverse problems; elastodynamics",,,,,,"Beck, J.V., Function specification method for solution of the inverse heat conduction problem, inverse problems in diffusion process (1995) Proceedings of the GAMM-SIAM Symposium, pp. 1-18. , edited by Engl, H.W. and Rundell, W; Lamm, P.K., Local regularization methods for linear inverse problem (1994) Proceedings Sixth Inverse Problem in Engineering Seminar, , edited by Murio, D.A., University of Cincinnati; Lagendijk, R.L., Biemond, J., (1991) Iterative Identification and Restoration of Images, , Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston; Inoue, H., Kishimoto, K., Shibuya, T., Koizumi, T., Estimation of impact force by inverse analysis, inverse problem in engineering mechanics (1993) IUTAM Symposium Tokyo 1992, , edited by Tanaka, M. and Bui, H.D., Springer-Verlag; Doyle, J.F., Determining the contact force during the transverse impact of plate (1997) Experimental Mechanics, 27, pp. 68-72; Hansen, P.C., (1998) Rank-Deficient and Discrete Ill-Posed Problems, , SIAM, Philadelphia; Sarkar, T.K., Tseng, F.I., Rao, S.M., Dianat, S.A., Hollmann, B.Z., Deconvolution of impulse response function time-limited input and output: Theory and experiment (1985) IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, IM-34 (4), pp. 541-546; Hageman, L.A., Young, D.M., (1981) Applied Iterative Method, , Academic Press, New-York; Golub, G.H., Van Loan, C.F., (1989) Matrix Computations, , The Johns Hopkins University Press, London; Huffel, S.V., Vandewalle, J., (1991) The Total Least-Squares Problem: Computational Aspects and Analysis, , SIAM, Philadelphia; Björck, A., Newton and Rayleight quotient methods for total least-squares problem (1997) Recent Advanced in Total Least Squares Techniques and Errors-in-Variable Modeling: Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Total Least Squares and Errors-in-Variables Modeling, , edited by Huffel, I.S.V., SIAM, Philadelphia; Kohnke, P., (1994) ANSYS - Theory Reference Manual, pp. 4.46-4.47. , ed., ANSYS, Inc., Canonsburg, PA; Tschoegl, N.W., (1989) The Phenomenological Theory of Linear Viscoelastic Behavior - An Introduction, , Springer-Verlag, Berlin","Gunawan, F.E.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, 1-1 Hibarigaoka, Tempaku Toyohashi, Aichi 441-8580, Japan; email: gunawan@mech.tut.ac.jp",,,,,,,,13447912,,JJMME,,"English","JSME Int.

A special cylindrical bar specimen was designed for the experiment. The specimen contains a bundle of glass fibers in the center and the bundle diameters were 1 and 2 mm. The fiber diameter is 7 μm. A static tension test was performed under the displacement control. The applied load-displacement curve was recorded for each specimen and then the debonding initiation load was defined as the deviation point from the linear curve. In addition, the debonding length was measured directly from the tested specimen. Using the debonding load measured from experiment, an axisymmetric finite element analysis is performed and debonding parameters K1 and K2 were computed. The results show the debonding initiation is fully dominated by an opening mode rather than a sliding mode and the stress intensity factor K1 for the debonding initiation is 2.OE+05 Pa √m. The mixed mode fracture takes place in the debonding propagation with constant mode mixity around 41.0 degree and the averaged stress intensity factors are 1.67E+05 Pa √m and 1.41E+05 Pa √m for the opening and the sliding mode, respectively.","Bimaterial; Debonding; Fracture toughness","Composite materials; Debonding; Finite element method; Matrix algebra; Parameter estimation; Stress intensity factors; Fiber glass composites; Static loading; Glass fibers; composite",,,,,,"Schuller, T., Becker, W., Lauke, B., Analytical and numerical calculation of the energy release rate for the micro bond test (1999) J.

The curvature of the L-curve that is important to locate the corner of the curve is computed using a finite difference approach. A new coordinate rotation method to locate the corner of the L-curve is proposed and the numerical simulation shows that the method provides a more robust performance in estimating the optimal solution than the curvature method. A criterion of an optimal solution based on minimizing the norm of residual vector is reformulated. This criterion can be applied to the problem in which the accuracy is important only in a particular region, and provides an accurate solution. The method is called a ""relaxed residual norm"" method. All the methods proposed in this chapter are examined and evaluated comprehensively using some ill-posed inversion problems. A good improvement to obtain the accurate solution for the problems is achieved. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The specimens contain a fiber bundle along the center axis of the specimen and are subjected to quasi-static monotonic tensile loading and impact loading. The circumferential notch was machined to distinguish three kinds of fracture processes, no fracture of the matrix at the notch root, fracture of the matrix and debonding along the interface between the matrix and the fiber. Interfacial strength under the static loading is significantly smaller than that under the impact loading. This result can account for the static fracture toughness of GFRP is much smaller than the dynamic fracture toughness obtained in the previous experiment.","Debonding; GFRP; Impact loading; Mode II stress intensity factor; Static loading","Debonding; Fracture toughness; Interfaces (materials); Stress intensity factors; Static loading; Composite materials",,,,,,"Becker, W., Lauke, B., (1997) Composite Science and Technology, 57, pp. 1689-1706; Liu, H.Y., Mai, Y.W., Ye, L., (1998) Key Engineering Materials, 145, pp. 613-620; Schuller, T., Becker, W., Lauke, B., (1999) J.

There are many people whose the living standards are under poverty line. It is caused by the community mindset, unequal education level, and high competitiveness in the world of work. Hence, there are many social-based businesses for improving the community welfare by giving various aids both in form of workforce, training, and funds. The more the number of companies in the social sector is, it certainly needs a tool that can illustrate this business as a whole. The impacts of social business are social impact and economic impact. It is about how those two impacts can be coexisted, provide positive things to many people, and improve the growth of the company significantly. This research aimed to understand the illustration of the business model in social business that can give social impact and economic impact and appropriate strategy to the company. Thereby, it can improve the competitiveness and provide the literature review about the concept and the social practice of enterprise in Indonesia. Social Business Model Canvas is a business model commonly applied to a social-based business so that it can map the business out effectively. © 2020, Allied Business Academies.

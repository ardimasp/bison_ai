OC-PIC (Oracle Communications Performance Intelligence Center) perform as database application whichisSTPintegrationtotakedataafteridentificationtheproble m.The result of this thesis was that can optimize configuration so that can be easier to solve the problem and avoid transaction data that is separated especially in SMS.It can be concluded configuration can reduce not appropriate transaction data. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

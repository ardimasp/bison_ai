P2p lending has gained significant momentum recently, with some platform has reached billion-dollar loan circulation. However, p2p lending platforms are not free from any form of risks. A higher return on investment for investor comes with a risk of the loan and interest not being repaid. For this purpose, this research proposes a tree-based classification method for predicting whether a loan will go bad or default before the loan is approved. The high dimensionality of the dataset needs to be processed and chosen carefully. This paper proposes a Binary PSO with SVM to perform feature selection for the dataset and Extremely Randomized Tree (ERT) and Random Forest (RF) as the classifiers. In this research, BPSOSVM-ERT and BPSOSVM-RF are compared with several performance metrics. The experimental results show BPSOSVM can produce subset of features without decreasing the performance from the original features and ERT can outperform RF in several performance metrics. © 2019 The Authors.

Transfering data from the sensor via the internet network to a monitoring device must be less than 300 ms. One process that can cause non-fulfillment of these requirements is a method for displaying the data on a monitor. There are several methods for delivering data from the sensor to a monitor. This paper has been compared between two methods, namely the polling method and the websocket method. The experiment was conducted to compare these two method. The result obtained that the websocket method was better in presenting real time data compared to the polling method. It can be shown in bandwidth usage and memory usage. In the experiment was found that the average of bandwidth usage is 478KB for polling method, and 91KB for web socket method in web based and the memory consumption of websocket less as much as 16% compared to polling method. In android smartphone the average bandwidth usage is 5.1 KB for web socket method and 15 KB for polling method and the memory consumption of websocket less as much as 22% compared to polling method. © 2019 The Authors.

A great amount of researches aimed to realize a tracking system that works inside a building. However, only few researches uses BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). In a tracking system using BLE, its position strongly determines the accuracy of the position of the object. Therefore, the goal of this research was to develop a positioning system using Bluetooth generation 4 and Bluetooth Low Energy based on the distance measurement. In this research, the trilateration technique applied at 4 models position was analyzed: AOTG (All on the Ground), UBS (Upper Beacon and Smartphone), UBLS (Upper Beacon Lower Smartphone) and LBUS (Lower Beacon Upper Smartphone). The experiment provided in this paper indicated that the best result achieved from the four models is shown by AOTG models with the direct line of sight between a beacon and a smartphone, which was fulfilled. The average error generated is 0.771meter. The second best result has been given by LBUS that has an average error of 0.841 meter. The third best result has been given by UBS that has an average error of 1.061 meter and the worst one has been given by UBLS that has an average error of 1.217 meter. © 2018 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.

This research aims to develop a human anatomy learning system using augmented reality technology. By using this system, it is expected that students can easily understand the anatomy of the human body using a 3D image visualization. The method used in this system is augmented reality marker on mobile computing platform. The marker is captured by taking a picture. Then, the captured image is divided into pieces and the pattern is matched with images stored in the database. In this research, we use Floating Euphoria Framework and combine it with the SQLite database. Augmented reality anatomy system of the human body has features that can interactively display the whole body or parts of the human organs. To evaluate the usefulness of the application, we tested the augmented reality anatomy system with high school students and medical students for learning the anatomy of the human body. The results show that the human anatomy learning system with interactive augmented reality visualization helps students learn human anatomy more easily. © 2018 The Authors.

Little's Law formula in Queue Theory provides a generic formula for waiting-time, but it cannot be implemented directly to give finite wait-time estimation in real-life. This study aims to investigate predictive variables that explain waiting-time duration. This paper uses Fast Artificial Neural Network engine to implement Artificial Neural Networks method. To train Artificial Neural Networks, Resilient Propagation was used. Time-series approach and structural approach for input neuron was compared. Average duration from previous interval and number of server was proposed to increase structural variable like Queue Length and Head of Line Duration estimator variable. To determine the best configuration for number of neuron in input and hidden layer, experimental method was used. The results of this study show that structural approach provides better estimation than time-series approach. Furthermore, modified helper variable combination provides a more refined result. © 2018 The Authors.

This makes business reporting less efficient and overwhelms query processing results in data warehouses so that they do not meet business requirements. The fast and complex evolution of the digital world must be scalable to the data warehouse process, so that the authors implement it in the data warehouse using massive parallel processing (MPP) with the Greenplum database, so that business users can get reports faster and more optimally. This case study explains how the MPP system implements and measures the performance of the Greenplum database by performing complex queries in the data warehouse with parallel processing. Therefore, this case study analyzes whether the use of MPP systems can measure the scalability of throughput and the response time in the data warehouse so that system performance in the Greenplum database remains stable for daily, weekly, and monthly operations. © 2018 The Authors.

The problem is the strong encryption algorithm is very complex and required intensive computational that need huge power consumption and others resources in mobile devices. Furthermore, people have been using mobile devices to transfer the important information or doing commercial transactions. In this case, security is an important issue to protect the sensitive information, but in the other hand, the portable or mobile devices powered by battery that have limitation in battery lifetime. Choosing the suitable encryption-decryption algorithm to implement in the mobile devices is one of the important decisions to secure exchanging sensitive information with constraining of this source of power. In this research, We evaluate the power consumption of four Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) finalist: RC6, Serpent, Mars, and twofish with respect to the size of file using Joulemeter, PassMark BatteryMon, and Wattch. Our research showed that the Twofish algorithm is the least amount of energy to encrypt the data and the Serpent algorithm is the most need energy to encrypt the data. © 2016 IEEE.","encryption algorithm; mobile; security","Complex networks; Data privacy; Electric batteries; Electric power utilization; Mobile security; Advanced Encryption Standard; Commercial transactions; Decryption algorithm; Encryption algorithms; mobile; security; Sensitive informations; Serpent algorithm; Cryptography",,,,,,"Soewito, B., Marcellinus, Y., Hapsara, M., Secure wireless Ad Hoc networks using zero knowledge proof (2014) Journal Computer Science, 10 (12), pp. 2488-2493; Soewito, B., Vespa, L., Weng, N., Characterizing power and resource consumption of encryption/decryption in portable devices (2008) Region 5 Conference, 2008 IEEE; Anderson, R., Biham, E., Knudsen, L., Serpent: A proposal for the advanced encryption standard (1999) AES Proposal; Rivest, R.L., Robshaw, M., Sidney, R., Yin, V.L., The rc6 block cipher (1998) AES Proposal; Schneier, B., Kelsey, J., Whiting, D., Wagner, D., Hall, C., Ferguson, N., Twofish: A 128-bit block cipher (1998) AES Proposal; Burwick, C., Coppersmith, D., D'Avignon, E., Mars - A candidate cipher for aes (1999) AES Proposal, , IBM Corporation; Brooks, D., Tiwari, V., Martonosi, M., Wattch: A framework for architectural-level power analysis and optimizations (2000) Proc. of ACM ISCA-27, p. 8394. , Vancouver, BC, June; Burger, D., Austin, T.M., (1997) The SimpleScalar Tool Set, Version 2. 0, , Technical Report 1342, Department of Computer Science, University of Wisconsin in Madison, June; Gladman, B., Cryptographic Technology Interests, , http://fp.gladman.plus.com/cryptographytechnology, AES related home page",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","11th International Conference on Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems, KICSS 2016","10 November 2016 through 11 November 2016",,128387,,9781509051304,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

To reduce the impact of reproductive disease, it is necessary to perform detection and early treatment to prevent significant losses and a wider spread of the disease. This article explains the application of an expert system that provides a means of consultation imitating the reasoning process of an expert in solving complex problems concerning the health of cows reproduction. We will apply Fuzzy Tsukamoto method to help diagnose the level of risk of disease in cattle based on six clinical symptoms. The result of this research is a mobile expert system that will conclude the level of risk of endometritis disease in cattle. This mobile application is developed based on android, for ease of use, and can be used by farmers in making the diagnosis by themselves. The validation results of this expert system show that the system is able to determine the level of risk of endometritis for cow's reproduction disease. © 2017 The Authors.

The proposed system relies on computer vision technique to monitor the movement of passengers crossing doors on the station. In this work, three background subtraction techniques, namely, Running Gaussian Average, Gaussian Mixture Model, and Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Model, were used to count the passengers crossing an entrance on a BRT station from a pre-recorded motion picture. The results indicates that the tree algorithms are able to identify the passenger crossing with a reasonable high level of recall and but low level of precision. These results indicates that many false positives are identified by the three algorithms. In addition, the empirical data indicate that the three algorithms tend to have better performance with higher value of the learning rate. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Background subtraction; Bus rapid transit; Computer vision; Passenger counting system","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Bus transportation; Buses; Computer vision; Gaussian distribution; Image segmentation; Light rail transit; Transportation; Adaptive Gaussian mixture models; Background subtraction; Background subtraction algorithms; Background subtraction techniques; Bus Rapid Transit; Bus rapid transit systems; Computer vision techniques; Counting system; Rapid transit",,,,,,"Morichi, S., Long-term strategy for transport system in asian megacities (2005) Journal of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies, 6, pp. 1-22; Gunawan, F.E., Koesnandar, E., Pranolo, F.L., Hartono, T., Pangestu, V., Empirical travel time reliability of transjakarta bus rapid transit (2012) Proceeding International Logistics Seminar and Workshop 2012: Competitive Logistics Operation As Key to Success in the Global Economy, pp. 7-11. , Jakarta; Gunawan, F.E., Empirical assessment on factors affecting travel time of bus rapid transit (2015) International Journal of Engineering and Technology, 7 (1), pp. 327-334; Gunawan, F.E., Suharjito, Gunawan, A.A.S., Simulation model for bus rapid transit (2014) EPJ Web of Conferences (Scopus Indexed), 68, p. 00021; Gunawan, F.E., Design and implementation of discrete-event simulation framework for modelling bus rapid transit system (2014) Elsevier Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology (Scopus Indexed), 14 (14), pp. 97-110. , 4; Campo, C., (2010) Bus Rapid Transit: Theory and Practice in the United States and Abroad, , http://hdl.handle.net/1853/37089, Master's thesis; School of civil and environmental engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology; Yunita, R., (2008) Busway for Jakarta: A Pressing Need, , AsiaViews; AsiaViews; Gunawan, F.E., Chandra, F.Y., Optimal averaging time for predicting tra-c velocity using floating car data technique for advanced traveler information system (2014) Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 138, pp. 566-575. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042814041603, doi:http://dx.d oi.org/10.1016/j.sbsp ro.2014.07.240; the 9th International Conference on Traffic and Transportation Studies (ICTTS 2014); Gunawan, F.E., Chandra, F.Y., (2014) Real-time Traffc Monitoring System Using Floating Car Method, , LAP Lambert Academic Publishing; Gunawan, F.E., Chandra, F.Y., Optimal averaging time for predicting traffic velocity using floating car data technique for advanced traveler information system (2014) Procedia - Social and Behavioural Sciences, 138, pp. 566-575. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042814041603, doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.07.240; Gunawan, F.E., Abbas, B.S., Atmadja, W., Chandra, F.Y., Agung, A.A., Kusnandar, E., Ergodicity of traffc flow with constant penetration rate for traffic monitoring via floating vehicle technique (2014) EPJ Web of Conferences, 68, p. 00020. , http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84901428304&partnerID=40&md5=4ec9707fb351b9126eb1b2826b15cb5f; Lumentut, J., Gunawan, F.E., Atmadja, W., Abbas, B.S., A system for real-time passenger monitoring system for bus rapid transit system (2015) 7th Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems (ACIIDS), , Bali, Indonesia; Kang, H., Kim, D., (2005) Real-time Multiple Tracking Using Competitive Condensation.

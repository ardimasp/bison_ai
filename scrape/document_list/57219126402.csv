Besides fashion, culinary becomes one of the attractions for tourists visiting Bandung. Even though it is proliferating, only a portion of this culinary business can last more than five years. Intense competition is one of the reasons, and now businesses must face economic problems caused by the spread of the SARS CoV 2 virus. Since the beginning of March, the government has closed offices, shopping centers, and schools. Now, after more than two months, businesses must prepare to reopen their businesses in conditions of an outbreak that have not entirely disappeared. One effort that can be done is to maintain company performance. This research studies the improvement of company performance by being oriented to innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurship. The results of the study revealed that product innovation and process innovation could support company performance while innovation could emerge through an entrepreneurial mindset, culture, leadership, and through creativity. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Creativity; Entrepreneurship; Innovation; Organization performance",,,,,,"Abouzeedan, A., (2001) Factors affecting the performance of SMEs and the survival index equation: A quantitative evaluation, , Pennsylvania: King of Prussia: Washington International University; Altman, E., Exploring the road to bankrupcy (1983) The Journal of Business Strategy, 4 (2), pp. 36-41; Alvarez, S., Barney, J., Resources-based theory and the entrepreneurial firm (2002) Strategic Entrepreneurship: Creating a new mindset, pp. 89-105. , M.

The effectiveness in food processing becomes emerging in the food industry. The automatic fruit classification system is becoming important for use in many food processing industries. A novel approach for classifying, using support vector machines (SVM) is presented in this paper. Fruit classification based on their shape is proposed in this work. The system differentiates the fruit based on their shape. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is extracted and later used as input to the SVM-based identifier. The fruit parameters are compared and classified, the results of computer simulation show that this technique produces better accuracy than that of the existing technique that is based on artificial neural network (Ann). The SVM also requires less training time than artificial neural network (Ann). © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In order to gain its stability, intentionally a simple filter with a low error rate of 1.67% during its full operation was placed. The time consumed during its steady flying in the air took approximately one second with the height of flying around 1 to 5 meters above the earth. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The object used in this research is trouble ticket system in telecommunications infrastructure provider. The goals of IT Management of Trouble Ticket System on information security are having ISO/ IEC 27001 certification and structured governance that provides not only the details of the processes involved in each area focusing on effectiveness and efficiency, but also insights into how business practices can produce sustainable results. It is therefore necessary to analyze IT governance, especially for information security. The maturity level will analyze the difference between the company's performance objectives and the company's current capabilities. COBIT 5 combined with CMMI used to analyze the information security of trouble ticket system. Interview and questionnaire were also used in this research. The analysis results show that the target capacity level for the 5 domains is 3. The results of the obtained assessments on EDM03, APO12 and BAI06 are 0, which means the process is incomplete. The value of APO13 capacity is 1 (Process executed) and the value of the capacity DSS05 is 3 (Process established), but not completely reached. There is a difference in the target and current level of capacity that underpins the author to propose recommendations, such as complete the output (work products) at level 1 and generic practices at level 2 and 3. © 2019 IEEE.","capability level; CMMI; COBIT 5; information security; trouble ticket system","Security of data; Surveys; capability level; CMMI; COBIT 5; Customer complaints; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Performance objective; Telecommunications infrastructures; Trouble ticket; Information management",,,,,"Pham, H.C., Information security burnout: Identification of sources and mitigating factors from security demands and resoources (2019) Journl of Information Security and Applications, pp. 96-107; Kruger, H., Flowerday, S., Drevin, L., Steyn, T., An assessment of the role of cultural factors in information security awareness (2011) Information Security South Africa (ISSA), pp. 1-7; Kim, A.C., Lee, S.M., Lee, D.H., Compliance Risk Assessment Measures of Financial Information Security using System Dynamics (2012) International Journal of Security and Its Applications, 6, pp. 191-200; Waly, N., Organisational information security management: The impact of training and awareness (2013) Evaluating the Socio-technical Impact on Organisational Information Security Policy Management; Merhi, M.I., Ahluwalia, P., Examining the impact of deterrence factors and norms on resistance to information systems security (2018) Computers in Human Behavior; Steinbart, P.J., Raschke, R.L., Gal, G., Dilla, W.N., The influence of a good relationship between the internal audit and information security functions on information security outcomes (2018) Accounting, Organization and Society, pp. 1-15; Hassanzadeh, M., Jahangiri, N., Brewster, B., A conceptual framework for information security awareness, assessment, and training (2014) A Conceptual Framework for Information Security Awareness, Assessment, and Training, pp. 99-109. , In M.

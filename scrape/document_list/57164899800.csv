The application of the Publish/Subscribe pattern on WebSocket connections resolved the issue of lost messages on WebSocket connections. The framework performances were compared to WebSocket connections itself with regards to messages loss, response latency times, and bandwidth network out. The results revealed that the proposed framework in this study led to message loss reduction. © 2015 IIJ.","HTML5; Message broker; Publish/subscribe; WebSocket",,,,,,"Alamsi, A., Kuma, Y., (2013) Evaluation of WebSocket Communication in Enterprise Architecture, , http://presentation.amiralmasi.com/EvaluationofWebSocketCommunicationinEnterpriseArchitecture_AmirAlmasi_YohanesKuma.pdf, Available; Liu, Q., Sun, X., Research of Web Real-Time Communication Based on Web Socket (2012) Int.

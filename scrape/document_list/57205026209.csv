The method used by the author is literature and field study. The author uses the field method to conduct interviews and conduct surveys to find supporting data that helps in the development of information systems portal community. Based on the results of the study, it was found that the designed community portal can help to know the business process of one of the existing community at this time, to help facilitate the community in managing new user candidates as well as old user and event data that has been going on and will take place and facilitate the community in doing storage and delivery of information to users quickly and accurately. © IAEME Publication.","Communities; Development; Information Systems; Online",,,,,,"Magazine, Y.O.T., (2014), www.youngontop.com/yotmagazine, November).

One of the E-Learning is Social Learning that can use social media as a learning media. This research discusses the use of social media Facebook as a learning media. The benefits of this research for educators are expected to give feedback for them on the use of social media Facebook in addition to learn activities, whereas for non-regular students, with the use of social media Facebook as a learning media it can increase the motivation of students in learning activities. The main objective of this research is to provide recommendations for the learning model that can improve the learning motivation of non-regular students. Methods of data collection use observation, literature study, and questionnaires given to 80 respondents in the category of non-regular students and the analysis of data use Microsoft Excel. From the analysis results it can be concluded that most of students choose social media as additional learning media. Hence authors design a learning model using social media Facebook. © 2018 IEEE.","motivation; non-regular; social media. facebook","E-learning; Information management; Motivation; Students; Surveys; Facebook; Internet technology; Learning Activity; Learning motivation; Learning simulation; Literature studies; Methods of data collections; non-regular; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Chan, W.T.Y., Leung, C.H., The use of social media for blended learning in tertiary education (2016) Universal Journal of Educational R Esearch, pp. 771-778; Horton, W., (2012) E-Learning by Design, , USA: Pfeiffer; Malik, M., Parveen, N., Intrinsic motivation of the high and low academic achievers (2015) American Journal of Educational Research, 3 (11), pp. 1481-1483; Anaraki, F., E-learning via social media (2015) The Twelfth International Conference on ELearning for Knowledge-based Society, Thailand; Yeo, M.M.L., Social media and social networking applications for teaching and learning (2014) European Journal of Science and Mathematics Education, pp. 53-62; VanDoorn, G., Eklund, A.A., Face to facebook: Social media and the learning and teaching potential of symmetrical, sychronous Communication (2013) Journal of University Teaching & Learning Pratice, pp. 1-14; Shi, L., Qudah, D.A., Cristea, A.I., Social e-learning in topolor: A case study (2013) IADIS International Conference E-Learning; Hussein, K., (2013) A Framework for Implementing Social Computing in Higher Education in the Gulf States, , Manchester, UK; Santti, P., (2008) Developing Corporate Knowledge Management Through Social Media; Lukman, E., (2015) The Latest Numbers on Web, Mobile, and Social Media in Indonesia (INFOGRAPHIC) 21 January, , https://www.techinasia.com/indonesia-web-mobiledata-start-2015/",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2018","3 September 2018 through 5 September 2018",,142373,,9781538658215,,,"English","Proc.

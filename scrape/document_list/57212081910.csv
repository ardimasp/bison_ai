In this work, the intelligent system approach is used to automatically identify the type of engine based on the sound of the engine. The combination of signal processing and machine learning technique for automatic petrol and diesel engine sound identification is presented in this work. After a signal preprocessing step of the engine sound, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based frequency characteristic modelling technique is applied as the feature extraction method. The resulting features extracted from the sound signal, in the form of frequency in the FFT matrix, are used as the inputs for the machine learning, the Support Vector Machine (SVM), step of the proposed approach. The experiment of FFT with SVM-based diesel and petrol engine sound identification has been carried out. The results show that the proposed approach produces a good accuracy in the relatively short training time. Experimental results show the training and testing accuracy of 100 % and 100 % respectively. They confirm the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent automatic diesel and petrol engine sound identification based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). © 2019 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.","Engine sounds; Fast fourier transform; Support vector machine","Fast Fourier transforms; Gasoline; Integrated circuits; Intelligent systems; Machine learning; Manufacture; Signal processing; Support vector machines; Feature extraction methods; Frequency characteristic; Machine learning techniques; Modelling techniques; Signal preprocessing; Sound identification; Support vector machine (SVMs); Training and testing; Diesel engines",,,,,"Czlc, S.T.L.C., (2012) Datasheet 3138-S Type Load Cell (0-100kg)-CZL301C, 1-4, , https://www.robotshop.com/media/files/pdf/datasheet-3138.pdf, [Accessed on June 22, 2018]; Ilková, V., Ilka, A., Legal aspects of autonomous vehicles-an overview (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 21st International Conference on Process Control (PC), pp. 428-433. , http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/249781/local_249781.pdf, (Štrbské Pleso, Slovakia, June 6-9, 2010); Vishwanath, J.P., Meti, C.A., Shobha, B.N., (2009) SASTech, 8 (1), pp. 93-100. , http://www.sastechjournal.com/pdf/Journals/April2009/13.pdf; (2017) ASEAN 4. 0: What Does the Fourth Industrial Revolution Mean for Regional Economic Integration?

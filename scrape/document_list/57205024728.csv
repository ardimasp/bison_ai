Those parameters are not well calculated that leads to wasteful costs if we keep doing the continuous bandwidth upgrades. In this paper we propose a new network design method for corporate network. The design is performed using top-down network design that considers the business and technical goals of the corporate. In order to improve the bandwidth utilization efficiency, we evaluate few traffic shaping methods in terms of bandwidth utilization, packet loss, and latency. The experiment results show that the proposed design using per-connection queue (PCQ) traffic shaping method achieves the best performance among all of the evaluated scenarios. © 2018 IEEE.","network design; PCQ; QOS; traffic shaping","Bandwidth; Information management; Quality of service; Band-width utilization; Corporate networks; Design and evaluations; Efficient bandwidth; Network design; Topdown; Traffic-shaping; Design",,,,,"Syafalni, I., Assertion-based verification of industrial WLAN system (2016) Proceedings-IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems, pp. 982-985. , 2016-July; Surantha, N., Maria, A., Nagao, Y., Ochi, H., Multiprocessor systemon-chip design for industrial wireless application (2016) 2016 International Symposium on Electronics and Smart Devices, ISESD 2016; Uwai, T., Lanante, L., Sai, B., Ochi, H., Nagao, Y., Surantha, N., Live demonstration IEEE802.11 wireless LAN system verification platform 2014 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems (APCCAS) 2014, pp. 175-176. , no.

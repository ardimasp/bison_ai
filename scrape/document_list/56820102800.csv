Various antecedents of ambidexterity have been studied. Several literatures described social technology adoption as a factor that positively correlates with organizational ambidexterity. This is promising to be explored further in Indonesia, where social technology is widely adopted. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively examine the relationship between social technology adoption and organizational ambidexterity. The result supported the hypothesis (p < 0.01, r = 0.501, 1-tailed). Further examinations found that organization can gain a difference on organizational ambidexterity by adopting Twitter and or LinkedIn, but not Facebook. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

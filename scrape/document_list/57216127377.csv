Plants need to capture photons as energy for photosynthesis in 400nm - 780nm spectrum. Different plant species will respond differently to specific light spectrum. Many studies have been done to find optimal light spectrum for plant growth, but there are still many researches to be done because there are still many combinations of light and plants species to be discovered. Specific light spectra combination is called light recipe. This research will help botanist to discover new light recipe for plant species by mixing 6 light spectra with individual intensity and time control. The developed grow light system has graphical user interface that run in Android tablet, and uses MQTT protocol for communication between android application and grow light system. Light recipe and setting are stored in database and the system also has light sensor to monitor light environmental conditions. Grow light consists of 6 types of 3W high power LED with specific color spectrum: Royal Blue, Deep Red, Ultraviolet, Full Spectrum, Far Red, and Natural White. Testing result shows that the system can produce uniform light distribution across the 50 x 50 cm grow area on average 22.6 μmol m-2s-1 using 60° lens. Germination result of lettuce using grow light shows good results compared to sunlight. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Artificial grow light; LED; MQTT; PAR","Android (operating system); Cultivation; Graphical user interfaces; Light emitting diodes; Android applications; Design and implementations; Environmental conditions; High power LED; Leafy vegetables; Light distribution; MQTT; Vegetative growth; Light",,,,"Binus University: 109/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019, 23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019, 038/VR","This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia, as a part of National Competitive Research Grant to Binus University titled “Integrated Hydroponic Automation System Design using Real Time OS based on ARM Cortex-M Microcontroller” with contract number: 109/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019, 23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019, 038/VR.RTT/IV/2019.","Kozai, T., Fujiwara, K., Runkle, E.S., (2016) LED Lighting for Urban Agriculture; Darkó, É., Heydarizadeh, P., Schoefs, B., Sabzalian, M., Photosynthesis under artificial light: The shift in primary and secondary metabolism (2014) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series B, Biological Sciences, 369; Snowden, M., Cope, K., Bugbee, B., Sensitivity of Seven Diverse Species to Blue and Green Light: Interactions with Photon Flux (2016) PLOS ONE, 11; Bantis, F., Ouzounis, T., Radoglou, K., Artificial LED lighting enhances growth characteristics and total phenolic content of Ocimum basilicum, but variably affects transplant success (2016) Scientia Horticulturae, 198; Byun, A., Mao, M., Sidhu, R., The Effect of Different Wavelenghts on the Germination time of Arabidopis thaliana wild type and mutant type seeds (2013) The Expedition, 3; Demotes, S., Péron, T., Corot, A., Bertheloot, J., Gourrierec, J., Travier, S., Crespel, L., Sakr, S., Plant responses to red and far-red lights, applications in horticulture (2015) Environmental and Experimental Botany, 309; Deram, P., Lefsrud, M., Orsat, V., Supplemental Lighting Orientation and Red-to-blue Ratio of Light-emitting Diodes for Greenhouse Tomato Production (2014) HortScience, 49; Hernández, R., Kubota, C., Tomato seedling growth and morphological responses to supplemental LED lighting red: Blue ratios under varied daily solar light integrals (2012) Acta Horticulturae, 956; Huché, L., Crespel, L., Gourrierecb, J., Morela, P., Light signaling and plant responses to blue and UV radiations - Perspectives for applications in horticulture (2016) Environmental and Experimental Botany, 121, pp. 22-28; Kopsell, D., Sams, C., Morrow, R., Blue Wavelengths from LED Lighting Increase Nutritionally Important Metabolites in Specialty Crops (2015) HortScience, 50","Atmadja, W.; Computer Engineering Department, Jl.

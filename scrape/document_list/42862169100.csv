Unlike financial and physical assets, intangible assets are difficult to emulate, which makes them a powerful source of competitive advantage. The study uses data from consumer goods firms listed on the Jakarta Stock Exchange. Pulic's Value Added Intellectual Coefficient (VAIC) model is utilised as the efficiency measure of capital employed, both human and structural capital. The regression model explores the relationship between intellectual capital and its contribution to the financial performance of firms in both current and future years. The results reveal that intellectual capital does contribute to the financial performance, with the exception of revenue growth of consumer goods firms in Indonesia. Furthermore, findings suggest that future performance is also affected by the level of intellectual capital. Finally, evidence shows that capital of physical, financial and structural nature is the most significant underlying driver of corporate performance. Although insignificant, human capital has a positive and consistent role in revenue growth. This paper contributes to the understanding that in creating corporate value, Indonesian investors placed less weight on the potential of intellectual capital.","Financial performance; Intellectual capital JEL classification: G10",,,,,,"Abdolmohammadi, M.J., Intellectual capital disclosure and market capitalization (2005) Journal of Intellectual Capital, 6 (3), pp. 397-416. , DOI 10.1108/14691930510611139; Brinker, B., Intellectual capital: Tomorrow's asset (2005) Today's Challenge, , http://www.cpavision.org/vision/wpaper05b.cfm, [Retrieved 24 January 2007]; Brinker, B., (2007) Intellectual Capital: Tomorrow's Assets, Today's Challege, , http//www.cpavision.org/vision/wpaper0b.cfm, From [Retrieved 09 February 2007]; Brooking, A., (1996) Intellectual Capital: Core Asset for the Third Millennium Enterprise, , New York: International Thomson Business Press; Bucklew, M., Edvinsson, L., (1999) Intellectual Capital at Skandia, , http://www.fpm.com/cases/el3.html, From [Retrieved 25 July 2007]; Chen, M.-C., Cheng, S.-J., Hwang, Y., An empirical investigation of the relationship between intellectual capital and firm's market value and financial performance (2005) Journal of Intellectual Capital, 6 (2), pp. 159-176. , DOI 10.1108/14691930510592771; Firer, S., Williams, S.M., Intellectual capital and traditional measures of corporate performance (2003) Journal of Intellectual Capital, 4 (3), pp. 348-360. , DOI 10.1108/14691930310487806; Hutchings, K., Michailova, S., Facilitating knowledge sharing in Russian and Chinese subsidiaries: The role of personal networks and groip membership (2004) Journal of Knowledge Management, 8 (2), pp. 84-94; Moore, L., Brand equity critical in firm's evaluation (2001) Boulder County Business Report, 19. , http://www.klminc.com/articles/-BldrCntyBusRptBran.pdf/, Oct. -1 Nov.

The method uses hypothesis testing of these companies. Corporate social responsibility is based on content analysis, whereas Value Added Intellectual Coefficient (VAIC) for the fiscal year of 2007 resulted from financial information. The result shows that intellectual capital, in its aggregate value of VAIC, does not show a significant relationship towards corporate social responsibility. However, one of its components, Capital Employed Efficiency showed a significant relationship while the other two, Human Capital Efficiency and Structural Capital Efficiency showed now significance. The results of the research could also infer that the perception of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is still in a stage where companies conduct it on an ad-hoc basis rather than incorporating them into corporate strategy.","Corporate social responsibility; VAIC","Efficiency; Knowledge management; Capital efficiency; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Corporate strategies; Exploratory studies; Financial information; Hypothesis testing; Intellectual capital; VAIC; Economic and social effects",,,,,"Andayani, W., Atmini, S., Wangi, M.J.K., Corporate Social Responsibility, Good Corporate Governance, and the Intellectual Property: An external strategy of the management to increase the company's value (2008) National Conference on Management Research, , Makassar; Andriessen, D., Making Sense of Intellectual Capital (2004), Oxford: Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann; Balabanis, G., Hugh Phillips, C.J.L., Corporate social responsibility and economic performance in the top British companies: are they linked?

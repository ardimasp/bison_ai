Currently, Internet enables sharing of those records possible, but it poses a new risk like misuse of patient data as it is shared. Meanwhile in Indonesia one of the main problems that faced in healthcare industry is hospital integration of electronic medical recording. At the age of internet era, one of the hottest technology, that arise is blockchain due to it is astonishing features such as security, transparency, and traceability. Blockchain comes out as a holy grail technology that have great opportunity in the future and already implemented in several business industry. Many previous studies have implemented blockchain in Healthcare. The article examines the use of blockchain in healthcare system, that have been studied and reviewed intensively to see how this technology can be implemented in healthcare system in Indonesia, and to solve several Electronic Medical Record (EMR) problems such as security, privacy and interoperability. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; EMR; Healthcare; Indonesia","Blockchain; Data Sharing; Health care; Hospital data processing; Interoperability; Medical computing; Medical problems; Business industry; Electronic medical record; Health-care system; Healthcare industry; Human health; Indonesia; Security and privacy; Sensitive informations; Electronic document exchange",,,,,"Ferdous, M.S., Biswas, K., Chowdhury, M.J.M., Chowdhury, N., Muthukkumarasamy, V., Integrated platforms for blockchain enablement (2019) Adv.

Lending Club is a P2P platform based in America. Besides its flexibility to give instant lending this industry have high risk for their investors to lending money. In order to mitigate this risk, this study aims to predict the default risk using decision tree J48 and naive bayes. One of the results in this research show that J48 and Naïve Bayes are both good in predicting the default in P2P lending sector. Another contribution of the paper might be useful for similar companies to see which factors that influence the most to default loan status. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

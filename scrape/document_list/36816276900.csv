Runners track their activities to know their progress and help them achieve their goals. One of the alternatives to monitor is through a fitness application which has also become a platform for runners to connect with their friends. As a running shoes manufacturer, XYZ Company wanted to help runners monitor their time, distance, pace, and calories burned while running. In addition, the company also wanted to support the running communities to grow bigger. This thesis project aimed at developing an Android-based application that provides feedback on users' activities while they are running, as well as features that lets them connect with their friends. Moreover, users are also able to schedule a run, compute their heart rate, and run with their friends. The application was developed using Java and utilized Google Maps API and Firebase. An application unit testing as well as unit acceptance testing both to users and client were performed to ensure that the application functions properly. The testing showed a satisfactory result and several recommendations for future development were also proposed. To conclude, the application was able to deliver all the client's requirement and achieve the aim of this thesis project. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt. Ltd.

Education is now very depending with technology and always keeps evolving to support each other. Teaching methods are now drastically change because the present of rapid development of technology. The way of teaching is now shifting due to the available technology and the students, parents and the society no longer accept the conventional teaching method, which is one-way communication. Presenting any materials with the help of technology, increase the successful rate of delivery of the materials and also increase the student's understanding. IT Initiative in IT Blueprint framework is one of the method to reduce the failure of the IT project (developing interactive presentation) but it still lack to measure the IT Initiative.

Everything changes to be more digitalized and simpler. The way teacher addressing the materials, the way the student record the materials from the teacher, the way to communicate between teachers and parents, has changed. How will the education institutions support the changes if they do not have a proper IT system? How will they have a proper IT system that aligns with their vision and mission and to support their business or even to have an IT system that become a business enabler? What they need is IT blueprint, before they start implementing the system.

The problem is that live messenger runs under a network with limited security and therefore facing threats such as interception, authenticity, interruption and fabrication. The purpose of this research is to design security protocol on live messenger that ensures authenticity and data or message confidentiality whenever data/messages are sent from one user to another user. The protocol is designed to ensure that no one except the authorized user are allowed to communicate to each other. The proposed protocol is an end-to-end protocol, where each user can only comunicate once each of the user are authenticated and have secured connections to each other. The researcher is designing this end-to-end protocol and perform a simulation to show that the communcation line is secured. The result shows that the communication line established is secured and the user can send messages in confidential. It is also shown in the simulation that if a attacker tries to intercept, it will be aknowledged by the users and the attacker is blocked and not able to establish connection. © 2015 The Authors.

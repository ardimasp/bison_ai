The databases contain many demanded valuable data for movie stakeholders in industry. Building a data warehouse is very important for data analysis that can help stakeholders to collect data and transform it into knowledge using Business Intelligence tools. In this paper, we will develop the data warehouse architecture for IMDb using kimball methodologies specifically for making a reporting system to analyze actor data like popularity and movies statistics. The dashboard results are expected to be valuable assets to be used by movie stakeholders and future data analysis. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

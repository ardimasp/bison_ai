Quantitative methodology was employed through survey method involving 180 respondents. There are ten independent variables include website security, website privacy, website brand name, word-of-mouth, website design & navigation, information, returns policy, country of origin, past experience, advertising and testimonials and one dependent variable which is brand trust. Security, privacy, word of mouth, design & navigation, and past experience were proven to have direct linear effects towards web brand trust. On the other hand, brand name, information, returns policy, country of origin and advertising & testimonials have weak relationships with web brand trust. Respondents who purchased clothing apparel were more concerned of the country of origin than respondents who purchased ticket accommodation. © 2019, IGI Global.",,,,,,,"Armesh, H., Salarzehi, H., Yaghoobi, N.M., Heydari, A., Nikbin, D., The effects of security and privacy information on trust & trustworthiness and loyalty in online marketing in Malaysia (2010) International Journal of Marketing Studies., 2 (2), pp. 223-254; Arndt, J., Role of product - Related conversations in the diffusion of a new product (1967) JMR, Journal of Marketing Research, 4 (3), pp. 291-295; Behboudi, M., Hanzae, K.H., Koshksaray, A.A., Tabar, M.J.S., Taheri, Z., A review of the activities of advertising agencies in online world (2012) International Journal of Marketing Studies, 4 (1), pp. 138-149; Belanger, F., Hiller, J.S., Smith, W.J., J.S.

This case study discusses how to convalesce IT services using the information technology infrastructure library (ITIL) framework and measure service level management (SLM) using Fuzzy ITIL (FITIL) approach. This paper aims to obtain an appropriate model for the measurement of IT service management by using fuzzy approach. Besides that, this paper aims to be able to provide an improving recommendations and IT governance based on current value (as is) and expected value (to be). The research method functioned is by measuring maturity level using best practice of ITIL v3 to condition before and after of improving process based on a questionnaire that has been performed. After obtaining the value of the maturity level for each cycle within ITIL, then the value will be created as an input for FITIL. The manufacture of FITIL is done in 4 stages, namely fuzzification, knowledge base, inference, and defuzzification. The results of the conditions before and after of the improving process have been successful in increasing the level of maturity in each ITIL cycle. The case study indicates an improvement in the increased level of maturity in SLM with FITIL approach. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It provides funding to increase research capacity in all units under IAARD. Because of the large scope of this program, a good monitoring and evaluation system is needed to ensure its effectiveness. A web-based application is proposed to complement the existing manual monitoring system. Design Thinking method and SCRUM are used as the approach to develop system. This system was developed using PHP 5 with Code Igniter framework and the database was developed using MySQL. This system has successfully implemented to all units under IAARD and are running smoothly for daily reporting system. © 2018 IEEE.","Evaluation; Information System; Monitoring; Reporting System; Web Application","Agriculture; Information systems; Pattern recognition; Research and development management; Websites; Agricultural research; Daily reporting system; Evaluation; Monitoring and evaluations; Reporting systems; Sustainable management; WEB application; Web-based applications; Monitoring",,,,"World Bank Group, WBG","I.

The research problem is effectiveness of community-based e-commerce transaction in facing e-marketplace trend on small and medium enterprise (SME) of online car accessories sales. Objective of the comparison is to determine which is the best customer preference towards promotion and sales about car accessories products in Small and Medium Enterprise (SME)'s in Indonesian e-Tailing market. This research used quantitative method T-test data analysis and the correlation methods to measure visitor access and sale frequency as well as analysis of the consumer data in BST forum and the e-Marketplace as a complement. The analysis showed that visitor access traffic and sales frequency in e-Marketplace is significantly higher than the BST's forum. Thus, we are highly recommend that every single SMEs retailer should promote their products on e-Marketplace channel aggressively. © 2017 IEEE.","Buy/Sale/Trade Forum; e-Marketplace; Online Transaction; Small Medium Enterprise (SME)","Commerce; Correlation methods; Information management; Buy/Sale/Trade Forum; Customer preferences; E-commerce transactions; E-marketplaces; Online transaction; Quantitative method; Small and medium enterprise; Small medium enterprise; Sales",,,,,,,"Hansen, T., Consumer values, the theory of planned behaviour and online grocery shopping (2008) Int.

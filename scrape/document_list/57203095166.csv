The aim of this research is to evaluate the implementation of IT Governance in Telecommunication Industries focuses mainly on the EDM and DSS domains based on the COBIT 5 and ISO 38500 frameworks. We have conducted an evaluation research and conducting collection of primary and secondary data. The data that we have compiled from questionnaires result were divided into 2 parts; Domain EDM questionnaires and Domain DSS questionnaires. The results of our evaluation from the Telecommunication Industries shows that the EDM Domain scored 4, 2 with the rating scale of 76%. Whereas the capability level for Domain DSS reached 4, 33 with the rating scale of 82%. In conclusion, our research as well as the evaluation that we have conducted on IT Governance implementation within Telecommunication Industries could be categorized as 'satisfactory. © 2020 IEEE.","COBIT 5; DSS; EDM; ISO 38500; IT governance implementation","Information management; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Surveys; Evaluation research; IT governance; Rating scale; Secondary datum; Telecommunication industry",,,,,"Witjaksono, R.W., Audit sistem informasi akademik universitas telkom menggunakan framework cobit 5 domain dss untuk optimasi proses service delivery (2019) Jurnal Rekayasa Sistem & Industri (JRSI), 6 (1); Juiz, C., Guerrero, C., Lera, I., Implementing good governance principles for the public sector in information technology governance frameworks (2014) Open Journal of Accounting, 3 (1), pp. 9-27; El Ghorfi, R., El Aroussi, M., Ouadou, M., Aboutajdine, D., Valuating it governance strategies with real options in a decision making framework (2018) International Journal of Information Systems in the Service Sector (IJISSS), 10 (4), pp. 42-58; Razak, R.A., Zakaria, M.S., The information and communication technology governance maturity level for Malaysian public sector (2017) Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Internet of Things, Data and Cloud Computing; (2005) Governance-Developing A Successful Governance Strategy: A Best Practice Guide for Decision Makers in IT, , NCC, I, John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated; Saputra, F.H., Perancangan tata kelola teknologi informasi menggunakan kerangka kerja cobit pada pt. biro klasifikasi Indonesia makassar. inspiration (2019) Jurnal Teknologi Informasi Dan Komunikasi, 9 (1), pp. 81-88; Selviyanti, E., Sardjono, W., Measuring maturity level of information technology governance at the television broadcasting company (2020) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1538 (1), p. 012045; C. 5: A business framework for the governance and management of enterprise it (2012) ISACA, , ISACA, Rolling Meadows, USA; Darenoh, M.P., Manuputty, A.D., Surachman, F., Evaluasi tingkat kapabilitas kinerja layanan ti pada layanan internet bidang a menggunakan framework cobit 5 domain mea 01 (studi kasus: Satuan organisasi xyz-lembaga abc) (2018) Jurnal Teknik Informatika Dan Sistem Informasi, 4 (1), pp. 58-66; Holt, A.L., (2013) Governance of IT: An Executive Guide to ISO/IEC 38500, , BCS Learning & Development Limited; Iso/iec standard published for governance of information technology Government Technology State & Local Articles-e.

Determination of the coordinates of the center point (centroid) is generally done by generating random numbers and each instance will then be placed based on proximity to random numbers generated. Determining a good centroid will prevent the occurrence of local optima problems in K-Means. The GenClust++ algorithm is a pretty good algorithm in determining centroid. However, what needs to be considered is the influence of the selection and crossover process on the performance of clustering. This study will discuss the combination of selection and crossover processes that are good in the process of determining the centroid. Performance measurement method will be based on the measurement of Mean Square Error and distance calculation using Euclidean Distance. The results show that the Roulette Wheel Selection and Whole Arithmetic Crossover selection processes will give the best performance for the GenClust++ Algorithm. © 2019 IEEE.","centroid; crossover; GenClust++; K-means; selection","Mean square error; Random number generation; centroid; crossover; GenClust; K-means; selection; K-means clustering",,,,,"Islam, M.Z., Estivill-Castro, V., Rahman, M.A., Bossomaier, T., Combining k-means and a genetic algorithm through a novel arrangement of genetic operators for high quality clustering (2018) Expert Systems with Applications, 91, pp. 402-417; Lloyd, S., Least squares quantization in pcm (1982) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 28 (2), pp. 129-137; Wu, X., Kumar, V., Quinlan, J.R., Ghosh, J., Yang, Q., Motoda, H., McLachlan, G.J., Steinberg, D., Top 10 algorithms in data mining (2008) Knowledge and Information Systems, 14 (1), pp. 1-37; Maitra, R., Peterson, A.D., Ghosh, A.P., (2010) A Systematic Evaluation of Different Methods for Initializing the K-Means Clustering Algorithm; Maulik, U., Bandyopadhyay, S., Genetic algorithm-based clustering technique (2000) Pattern Recognition, 33 (9), pp. 1455-1465; Rahman, M.A., Islam, M.Z., Crudaw: A novel fuzzy technique for clustering records following user defined attribute weights (2012) Tenth Australasian Data Mining Conference; Zahra, S., Ghazanfar, M.A., Khalid, A., Azam, M.A., Naeem, U., Prugel-Bennett, A., Novel centroid selection approaches for kmeans-clustering based recommender systems (2015) Information Sciences, 320, pp. 156-189; Liu, Y., Wu, X., Shen, Y., Automatic clustering using genetic algorithms (2011) Applied Mathematics and Computation, 218 (4), pp. 1267-1279; Rahman, M.A., Islam, M.Z., A hybrid clustering technique combining a novel genetic algorithm with k-means (2014) Knowledge-Based Systems, 71, pp. 345-365; Beg, A.H., Islam, M.Z., Estivill-Castro, V., Genetic algorithm with healthy population and multiple streams sharing information for clustering (2016) Knowledge-Based Systems, 114, pp. 61-78; Muzid, S., Dinamisasi parameter algoritma genetika menggunakan population resizing on fitness improvement fuzzy evolutionary algorithm (profifea) (2014) Seminar Nasional Teknologi Dan Informatika; He, S., Dai, Y., Zhou, R., Zhao, S., A clustering routing protocol for energy balance of wsn based on genetic clustering algorithm (2012) IERI Procedia, 2, pp. 788-793; Cowgill, M.C., Harvey, R.J., Watson, L.T., A genetic algorithm approach to cluster analysis (1999) Computers & Mathematics with Applications, 37 (7), pp. 99-108; Meng, Y., Liang, J., Cao, F., He, Y., A new distance with derivative information for functional k-means clustering algorithm (2018) Information Sciences, 463-464, pp. 166-185; Ongko, H.E., Abdullah, D., Determining a cluster centroid of k-means clustering using genetic algorithm (2015) International Journal of Computer Science and Software Engineering, 4 (6), pp. 160-164; (2018) Machine Learning Repository, , https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php, UCI [online] Available: [Accessed 6 September",,"Supangkat S.H.Sembiring J.Arman A.A.Nugraha IGB.B.Bandung Y.",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","10th International Conference on ICT for Smart Society, ICISS 2019","19 November 2019 through 20 November 2019",,157204,,9781728148809,,,"English","Proceeding - Int.

This paper gives easy understanding for bachelor and master degree students to understand about AOI characteristic rule algorithm which only implement AOI characteristic rule algorithm between line number 1 and 8. Meanwhile, using threshold in AOI has been known as tedious and consuming work, however in our future research this limitation will be resolved where maximum number of threshold will depend on maximum number of distinct values in dataset. © Research India Publications.","AOI; Attribute Oriented Induction; Characteristic rule; Concept Hierarchy; Data Mining",,,,,,"Han, J., Cai, Y., Cercone, N., Knowledge discovery in databases: An attribute-oriented approach (1992) Proceeding of 18Th International Conference Very Large Data Bases, pp. 547-559. , Vancouver, British Columbia; Warnars, S., Mining Patterns with Attribute Oriented Induction (2015) Proceeding of International Conference on Database, Data Warehouse, Data Mining and Big Data (DDDMBD), pp. 11-21. , Tangerang, Indonesia; Warnars, S., Measuring Interesting rules in characteristic rule (2010) Proceeding of the 2Nd International Conference on Soft Computing, Intelligent System and Information Technology (ICSIIT), pp. 152-156. , Bali, Indonesia; Wu, Y., Chen, Y., Chang, R., Generalized knowledge discovery from relational databases (2009) International Journal of Computer Science and Network, 9 (6), pp. 148-153; Han, J., Cai, Y., Cercone, N., Data-driven discovery of quantitative rules in relational databases (1993) IEEE Transction on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 5 (1), pp. 29-40; Han, J., Fu, Y., Exploration of the power of attributeoriented induction in data mining (1995) Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 399-421. , U.

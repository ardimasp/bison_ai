This research uses quantitative descriptive method, with multiple linear regression analysis using IBM-SPSS. The data used in the 2014-2019 annual quarter is sourced from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) and Bank Indonesia (BI). This study found that there was a positive and significant effect between the variable of household consumption and GDP, on the contrary the investment variable, government expenditures and net export had no significant effect on GDP. Meanwhile, simultaneously household consumption, investment, government expenditures and net exports has a significant effect on GDP. Finally, this study concludes that the contribution of household consumption to GDP is greater than investment, government expenditures and net exports. The implication is that the government in this case should encourage ease of investment, especially PMA. Government spending sectors, such as infrastructure, need to be increased again in order to create economic efficiency. Furthermore, the government policy to encourage exports and reduce the rate of imports in the future is highly expected © 2019 by Advance Scientific Research.","Government Expenditures; Gross Domestic Product (GDP); Household Consumption; Investment; Net Exports",,,,,,"Statistik, B.P., (2010) PDB Triwulanan Atas Dasar Harga Konstan 2010 Menurut Pengeluaran (Miliar Rupiah), , Seri 2014-2019; (2019) Perkembangan Ekonomi Keuangan Dan Kerjasama Internasional Edisi 2014-2019, , Bank Indonesia; Mankiw, N., Gregory, D.K.K., (2012) Pengantar Ekonomi Makro, , Jakarta: Salemba Empat; Latumaerissa, R., Julius, (2015) Perekonomian Indonesia Dan Dinamika EkonomiGlobal, Mitra Wacana Media Penerbit, , Jakarta; Ridzuan, A.R., Md Razak, M.I., Ibrahim, Z., Noor dan, A.H.M., Ahmed, E.M., Household consumption, domestic investment, government expenditure and economic growth: New evidence from Malaysia (2014) Journal of Scientific Research & Reports, 3 (17), pp. 2373-2381. , Article no.

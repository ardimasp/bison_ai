The 3D model of the serpentine robot is drawed in Autocad Inventor ® and exported to SimMechanics® for straighforward modeling of the kinematics. The gaits are important for robots designed to explore ruins of disasters where the working spaces are very tight. For maximum flexibility of the serpentine robot, we adopted a joint design with three parallel actuators, where the joint is capable of linear movement in the forward axis, and rotational movements around two other axes. The designed linear expansion gaits is calculated for forward movement when the robot is posing straight or turning laterally. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,"Murphy, R.R., Trial by fire (2004) IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine, 11 (3), pp. 50-61; Hopkins, J.K., Spranklin, B., Gupta, S., (2009) A Survey of Snake-inspired Robot Designs, 4, p. 2; Kinagasa, T., Otani, I., Haji, T., Yoshida, K., Osuka, K., Amano, H., Flexible Monothread Mobile Track (FMT) - A new mobile mechanism using one track and vertebral structure (2010) Robotics 2010: Current and Future Challenges, pp. 241-259; Borenstein, J., Hansen, M., Borrell, A.M., The OmniThread OT-4 serpentine robot - Design and performance (2007) Journal of Field Robotics, pp. 601-621; Behrens, R., Kuchler, C., Forster, T., Elkmann, N., Kinematik analysis of a 3-DOF joint for a novel hyper-redundant robot arm (2011) IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 3224-3229; Ohno, H., Hirose, S., Design of Slim Slime Robot and its Gait of Locomotion (2001) IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pp. 707-715",,,"","EDP Sciences","2013 International Conference on Advances Science and Contemporary Engineering, ICASCE 2013","23 October 2013 through 24 October 2013","Jakarta",,21016275,,,,"English","EPJ Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901423047

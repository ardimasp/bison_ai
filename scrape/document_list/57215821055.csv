The problem of car parking is a significant contributor to traffic congestion and has still been a significant problem with the increasing size of vehicles in the luxury segment and also limited parking spaces in urban cities particularly in Jakarta as an Indonesian capital city. The rapid growth in the number of vehicles around the world further adds to the problem of the lack of parking spaces. Our proposed ParkFinderID mobile application has multiple benefits such as for people for easy finding parking space in crowded places, for landlord who wants to let their property land as parking space becoming a new way for disruption technology for getting new or adding income for unused land. For government, this application will make easy their regulation and controlling regarding parking space and traffic jump and at the end of the day will give a huge contribution to society to reduce traffic jump and congestion regarding using sidewalk shoulder rood for illegal parking space. Hopefully, this application will reduce congestion particularly for traffic in Jakarta. © 2020 ISSN.","Parking mobile online application; Smart parking application; Smart parking area; Smart parking lot; Smart parking system",,,,,,"Aalsalem, M.Y., Khan, Z.W., CampusSense, A smart vehicle parking monitoring and management system using ANPR cameras and Android phones (2016) ICACT Trans.

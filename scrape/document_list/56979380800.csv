Large amount of medical data of DM patients is available and it provides significant advantage for researchers to fight against DM. The main objective of this research is to leverage F-Score Feature Selection and Fuzzy Support Vector Machine in classifying and detecting DM. Feature selection is used to identify the valuable features in dataset. SVM is then used to train the dataset to generate the fuzzy rules and Fuzzy inference process is finally used to classify the output. The aforementioned methodology is applied to the Pima Indian Diabetes (PID) dataset. The results show a promising accuracy of 89.02% in predicting patients with DM. Additionally, the approach taken provides an optimized count of Fuzzy rules while still maintaining sufficient accuracy. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

[25] and the model of Lin and Lee [13] using the Levenberg-Marquardt method. This modeling is particularly important in the case of ground motion given that it takes a good model for predicting the strength of earthquakes in order to reduce the risk of the impact of the natural disaster. There are two main contributions of this research is the optimization of ground motion attenuation models with Levenberg-Marquardt method on two models that have been extensively used and the development of computer applications to help accelerate modeling, especially on large data with an area of extensive research. Levenberg-Marquardt method proved to give a good contribution to the modeling of ground motion attenuation that is indicated by the very small deviations between the predicted values with the actual value. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Earthquake; Ground motion attenuation; Levenberg-Marquardt","Computer control systems; Disasters; Geophysics; Intelligent systems; Optimization; Ground motions; Ground-motion attenuations; Large data; Levenberg-Marquardt; Levenberg-Marquardt method; Natural disasters; Optimization modeling; Earthquakes",,,,,"Ahumada, A., Altunkaynak, A., Ayoub, A., Fuzzy logic-based attenuation relationships of strong motion earthquake records (2015) Expert Syst.

It is estimated that the preva- lence will increase 55% in 20351. As a form of our efforts to contribute to the prevention of this phenomenon we propose an application of computational intelligence by using fuzzy hierarchical model that has the ability to perform early detection against DM. In order to achieve the success of our propose method, we cooperate with one of the eastern Jakarta hospital laboratory in Indonesia as a facilitator of the data that we need during research and conducting interviews with two medical doctors at the same hospital as a form of knowledge acquisition process. The architecture of our proposed method is designed based on how a medical doctor concluded related to indication that someone has the potential against DM, which is the model has been adjusted with the data we have obtained from the authorities in the laboratory. As a form of evaluation that we do, we did a comparison of the data we have obtained from our method with the medical doctor decision which is equipped with the data from laboratory, and the result is 87.46% of the 311 relevant data is equal to medical doctor's statement. In interpreting the conclusions that we get with the hospitals that cooperate with us, the results showed that the method we propose has meet the needs of the effectiveness and efficiency in performing early detection against DM and can help people in knowing the potential of DM since early. © 2015 The Authors.

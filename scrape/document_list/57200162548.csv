To reduce the impact of reproductive disease, it is necessary to perform detection and early treatment to prevent significant losses and a wider spread of the disease. This article explains the application of an expert system that provides a means of consultation imitating the reasoning process of an expert in solving complex problems concerning the health of cows reproduction. We will apply Fuzzy Tsukamoto method to help diagnose the level of risk of disease in cattle based on six clinical symptoms. The result of this research is a mobile expert system that will conclude the level of risk of endometritis disease in cattle. This mobile application is developed based on android, for ease of use, and can be used by farmers in making the diagnosis by themselves. The validation results of this expert system show that the system is able to determine the level of risk of endometritis for cow's reproduction disease. © 2017 The Authors.

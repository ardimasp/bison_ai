This assessment has both summative and formative elements, coordinated by an underlying learning progression. Drawing on a literature review on statistics curricula, we have developed (a) a framework for data-based reasoning at the college-entry level and (b) an instrument to measure two of the constructs in that framework: Linking Data to a Claim (LDC) and Formal Inference (FoI). The LDC construct describes student development in thinking about the link between data and the content of a statistical claim, while FoI describes student development in critical reasoning when making formal inference with respect to the notions of practical and statistical significance. Using the BEAR Assessment System (BAS) iterative approach for the instrument development, we found that the developmental progressions defined as FoI and LDC are promising, but that further iterations of the BAS cycle are needed. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,"Adams, R.J., Reliability as a measurement design effect (2005) Studies in Educational Evaluation, 31, pp. 162-172; Agresti, A., Finlay, B., (2009) Statistical methods for the social sciences, , 4th ed.).

This paper first describes how the Tanoto Foundation has designed and implemented its teacher quality improvement programme for in-service teachers in remote schools in Indonesia and then uses this context to examine to what extent teachers benefited from these programmes.

Utilizing an argument-based framework for validation based on the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing, we explore the evidence for the ongoing use of the Performance Assessment for California Teachers (PACT) for Tier I licensure decisions. The evidence for a unidimensional and a multidimensional structure based on the instrument’s content are examined with an item response model. Examining operational data (n = 1,711) from seven California teacher education institutions, we found sufficient internal structure validity evidence to support the continued, but limited, use of this instrument for its intended summative purpose. Evidence for a three-dimensional structure of model fit better explains overall teacher candidate performance on the PACT instrument as it is currently designed. © 2014 American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education.","1999 testing standards; internal structure evidence; item response modeling; multidimensionality; teacher licensure",,,,,"University of California Berkeley, UC Berkeley

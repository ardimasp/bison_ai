Several cases had been reported due to the usage of a fake transcript. One modus of using fake transcript is to enter a higher level of education and job promotion. The new technology found called Blockchain believes in solving the problem. Characteristics of Blockchain Technology such as secured, immutable, distributed, transparent seem to be matched with transcript document requirement. Therefore, the research tries to create a process model of the university teaching and learning process. Several studies have been done; however, no detailed process shown especially for teaching and learning activities. The research question is, how are teaching, and learning activities can be supported by Blockchain Technology? Qualitative method used in this research, focus group discussion with 9 reputable universities discussed the academic operation process and the result show that it is possible to adopt Blockchain Technology into the teaching and learning process to avoid forgery of university transcript documents. © 2020 IEEE.","Blockchain technology; Blockchain technology-based; Teaching and learning process; Transcript","Blockchain; Information management; Teaching; Innovative solutions; Learning Activity; Level of educations; Operation process; Qualitative method; Research questions; Teaching and learning; University teaching; Learning systems",,,,"12/AKM/PNT/2019","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This study is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Implementasi Blockchain Platform Untuk Menciptakan “Good Governance” pada Perguruan Tinggi” or “The Implementation of Blockchain Platform to Create“Good Governance” in Higher Education” with contract number: 12/AKM/PNT/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","Ari, S., (2015) Perguruan Tinggi Harus Waspadai Transkrip Nilai Palsu-Tribun Jogja, , https://jogja.tribunnews.com/2015/01/09/perguruan-tinggi-haruswaspadai-transkrip-nilai-palsu, jogja.

This research evaluates the implementation of the Financial Accounting and Control (FICO) ERP system in one of Indonesian state-owned enterprises by identifying the factors such as individual characteristics, organizational characteristics, and technological characteristics that affect the perceived usefulness and the perceived ease of use of the ERP system, as well as how they in turn affect the intention to use, the usage, and its individual impacts. This research utilizes the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to measure the users' acceptance of an ERP system, which is then analyzed using the Structured Equation Model-Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS) data analysis model. The results of the research show that partially there are exogenous variables that significantly affect the endogenous variables such as perceived ease of use of ERP against perceived usefulness of ERP, the intention to use and the perceived usefulness of ERP, complexity and compatibility against perceived ease of use of ERP, intention to use against usage, usage against individual performance, and usage against individual performance and panoptic empowerment. Simultaneously, the research also shows a significant influence. Therefore, in order to measure the users' acceptance rate of an ERP system, then all the exogenous variables, as well as perceived usefulness of ERP, perceived ease of use of ERP, intention to use, usage of ERP, and individual impact which consists of panoptic empowerment and individual performance has to be performed. © 2018 IEEE.","Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP); Evaluation; Financial Accounting and Control (FICO); Implementation","Finance; Least squares approximations; Resource allocation; Enterprise resource planning (ERP); Enterprise resource planning systems; Evaluation; Financial accounting; Implementation; Organizational characteristics; Structured equation modeling; Technological characteristics; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,,"Dantes, G.R., Hasibuan, Z.A., The impact of enterprise resource planning (ERP) system implementation on organization: Case study erp implementation in Indonesia (2011) IBIMA Bu5inass Review Journal, 2011, p. 110; Xu, Y., Yeh, C.-H., Evaluating critical strategies for enterprise resource planning systems implementation Proc. of the 2009 Second International Sympo5ium on Electronic Commerce and Security, , http:www.ieee.org, 22-24 May 2009, Nanchang City, China IEEE Xplore [accessed: 29 Jan. 2017]; Monk, E., Wagner, B., (2013) Concepts in Enterprtse Re5ource Planning (4th Cdi.

In this point, the transaction raises several new and crucial challenges. At a closer look, the concerns appeared due to no data integration, verification, and validation from parties both inside or outside of the university. In this respect, the data is not centralized or integrated. As this backdrop, this causes repeated data confirmation, and no one can authenticate the data validity when distributed to other parties. In this point of entry, the diploma certification forgery has become one of the significant issues in education in Indonesia. As a framework that enables the data integration, Blockchain contains verified data on every single of a transaction, so the data is trustworthy. With this in mind, this paper aims to discuss the best blockchain model for the university level. This study is qualitative-based research. As a result, McRhys model is introduced as a potential and implementable blockchain model in university in Indonesia. © 2019 IADIS Press.

One of the tools that can be used to bridge between graduates and companies is an integrated career portal. This portal can be optimized to help industry find the employees they need from the alumni from university. On the other hand, this tool can help graduates to get job that suits their competency. By using the portal, alumni can hopefully minimize the number of unemployed university graduates and accelerate their absorption into job market. The development of this career portal will use agile methodology. Questionnaire was distributed to alumni and employers to collect information about what user need in the portal. The result of this research can create a career portal which integrated business process and social media. © 2017 IEEE.","agile methodology; e-Business; integrated career portal; social media","Employment; Information management; Social networking (online); Agile Methodologies; eBusiness; Industry sectors; Integrated business; Job market; Social media; University graduates; User need; Commerce",,,,,,"(2017) Education Indicators in Focus, , http://www.oecd.org/edu/skills-beyondschool/educationindicatorsinfocus.htm, (August 11).

The purpose of this research is to evaluate the quality of HIS in a private multi-specialty hospital in Indonesia as the mean to recommend possible actions for the management and IT department in the effort of achieving continuous improvements. The approach involves integrating SERVQUAL method, Kano Model and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) for measuring HIS quality attributes that are adopted from DeLone & McLean IS Success Model dimensions from the users' perspective. This research shows the low user satisfaction level towards the current HIS quality, and then the attributes required for betterment are subsequently identified. As the final outcome, the House of Quality is successfully constructed in order to propose systematic and measured improvement priorities that the hospital should perform to fulfill the users' needs and desires of a high quality HIS. © 2016 IEEE.","continuous improvement; hospital information system; IS Success Model; quality function deployment","Information management; Information systems; Quality function deployment; Continuous improvements; Healthcare institutions; Hospital information systems; House of Quality; IS success model; Quality attributes; Quality function deployments (QFD); User satisfaction levels; Hospitals",,,,,,"Chatzoglou, P.D., Fragidis, L.L., Doumpa, T., Aggelidis, P., Hospital information system evaluation (2012) 10th International Conference on ICT in Health, 14, pp. 240-257. , Samos Island, Greek; Chaudhry, B., Wang, J., Wu, S., Maglione, M., Mojica, W., Roth, E., Morton, S.C., Shekelle, P.G., Systematic review: Impact of health information technology on quality, efficiency, and costs of medical care (2006) Annals of Internal Medicine, 144 (10), pp. 742-752; Haux, R., Winter, A., Ammenwerth, E., Brigl, B., (2013) Strategic Information Management in Hospitals: An Introduction to Hospital Information Systems, , New York: Springer-Verlag; Aggelidis, V.P., Chatzoglou, P.D., Methods for evaluating hospital information systems: A literature review (2008) EuroMed Journal of Business, 3 (1), pp. 99-118; Rahimi, B., Vimarlund, V., Methods to evaluate health information systems in healthcare settings: A literature review (2007) Journal of Medical Systems, 31 (5), pp. 397-432; Ribière, V., LaSalle, A.J., Khorramshahgol, R., Gousty, Y., Hospital information systems quality: A customer satisfaction assessment tool (1999) Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Science, pp. 7-16. , Hawaii.

One of the resources is ornamental fish, both salt water and fresh water fishes. There are at least 240 types of marine or saltwater ornamental fish and 226 types of freshwater ornamental fish. This huge potential and the supporting natural ecosystem open a big opportunity to improve non-petroleum export, especially in the ornamental fish sector. This can be seen from the improving value and production occurred recently. This commodity had a fairly significant growth and has a promising economic prospect. This growth has to be complemented with the infrastructure to sell the fishes to the customer in various countries. One of the infrastructures that can support is information technology and information system. Internet is one of the infrastructures used by 251 million of world population to find information and make an online transaction. Without the internet, all the business activities in the world will be disrupted. This research is focused to create and apply an application to help ornamental fish sellers in Indonesia improve their sales number. The growth on sales number can hopefully improve the income of ornamental fish sales. This e-commerce application can also be used by anyone around the world to sell and buy ornamental fish listed in the application's product catalog. The products offered in the application is not limited to only ornamental fish, but also other fishery tools, equipment, and accessories. © 2015 IEEE.","e-Commerce implementation; fish breeders; ornamental fish; social media","Commerce; Electronic commerce; Internet; Sales; Water; Business activities; E-Commerce applications; E-commerce implementation; Economic prospects; Online transaction; Ornamental fish; Social media; Tropical countries; Fish",,,,,,"Turban, E., King, D., Lee, J., Liang, T.-P., Turban, D., (2012) Electronic Commerce 2012, , 7th edition, Pearson, (references); Laudon, K.C., Traver, C.G., (2012) E-commerce 2012: Business, Technology and Society, , Person.

The abundance amount of available data has become a unique challenge for the organisation to manage and process its data to be more useful information. The concept of processing large amounts of data that do not interfere the operational data is called 'Data Warehouse' technology. Data warehouse serves as the basis to build an executive dashboard application that could assist the board of leadership in universities to access information in visual form to accelerate and improve the readability of the information itself. The developers of Executive Dashboard should meet what the board of leadership needs and stick to the information system architecture based that university has. This development method utilizes Key Performance Indicator approach owned by the university. To build a proper executive dashboard, developers need data warehouse that is built through the initial stage of system development life cycle for the data warehouse. Since it is applied to universities, this executive dashboard application is called as the University Dashboard. © 2014 IEEE.","data warehouse; executive dashboard; key performance indicators (KPI); university dashboard","Data warehouses; Decision making; Life cycle; Waste disposal; Competitive markets; Decision making process; executive dashboard; Information system architecture; Key performance indicators; Large amounts of data; System development life cycles; university dashboard; Benchmarking",,,,,,"Zagorecki, A., Ristvej, J., Comfort, L.K., Lovecek, T., Executive dashboard systems for emergency management (2012) Communication Review, 2, pp. 82-89; Garrett, G., How to create a business intelligence strategy (2012) SAS Global Forum 2012, Applied Business Intelligence, pp. 1-8; Velcu-Laitinen, O., Yigitbasioglu, O.M., The use of dashboards in performance management: Evidence from sales managers (2012) The International Journal of Digital Accounting Research, 12, pp. 39-58. , March; Cui, Z., Damiani, E., Leida, M., Benefits of ontologies in real time data access (2007) Digital EcoSystems and Technologies Conference, DEST '07, pp. 392-397. , Inaugural, IEEE-IES, 21-23 February; Dennis, A., Haley Wixom, B., Tegarden, D., (2009) Systems Analysis and Design with UML 2.0 An Object-Oriented Approach, , 3rd edition John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Turban, E., Aronson, J.E., Liang, T., Sharda, R., (2007) Decision Support and Business Intelligence System, p. 209. , 8th edition, Prentice Hall; David, F.R., (2011) Strategic Management Concepts and Cases, , Thirteenth edition, Prentice Hall; Stackowiak, R., Rayman, J., Greenwald, R., (2007) Oracle Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence Solutions, , Wiley Publishing, Inc, Indianapolis; Sauter, V.L., (2010) Decision Support System for Business Intelligence, p. 400. , Second edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Inmon, W.H., (2005) Building the Data Warehouse, p. 21. , Fourth Edition, Wiley publishing Inc; Profil Perguruan Tinggi, , http://forlap.dikti.go.id/, DIKTI, [Online], accessed on January 26th, 2014 - 17.16 pm","Meyliana; School of Information Systems, Bina Nusantara UniversityIndonesia",,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2nd International Conference on Information and Communication Technology, ICoICT 2014","28 May 2014 through 30 May 2014",,114769,,9781479935819,,,"English","Int.

Such characteristics may be advantageous in voice activity detection where it can be assumed that the target speaker is close and background noise sources are distant. In this paper we develop a simple modification to the EVRC rate determination algorithm (EVRC RDA) to exploit the noise-canceling property of differential microphone array to improve its performance in highly dynamic noise environment. Comprehensive computer simulations show that the modified algorithm outperforms the original EVRC RDA in all tested noise conditions.

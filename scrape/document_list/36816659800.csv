Statistics show that the case of breast cancer in the world is increasing every year. By analyzing a mammogram, pathologists could detect the presence of microcalcification in ones breast. However, microcalcification could be classified into benign and malignant. The later indicates the presence of cancer. Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CADx) designed to help phatologists determine the type of microcalcification in a mammogram. Usually, it's consist of two steps, feature extraction and classification. In our methodology, we proposed the use of dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT CWT) as feature extraction technique and support vector machine (SVM) as classifier. Using this methodology, our experimental result achieved good classification accuracy. However, some of the previous researches have shown better results than ours. © 2010 IEEE.","Computer-aided diagnosis; Dual-tree complex wavelet transform; Mammogram; Microcalcification classification; Support vector machine","Breast Cancer; Classification accuracy; Dual-tree complex wavelet transform; Feature extraction and classification; Feature extraction techniques; Mammogram; Microcalcifications; Feature extraction; Mammography; Partial discharges; Support vector machines; Telecommunication; Vectors; Wavelet transforms; X ray screens; Computer aided diagnosis",,,,,"Yusof, N.Md., Isa, N.A.M., Sakim, H.A.M., Computer-aided detection and diagnosis for microcalcifications in mammogram: A review (2007) ICJSNS International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, 7 (6), pp. 202-208. , June; Safavian, N., Kasaei, S., Complex Wavelet Transform-based Color Indexing for Content-based Image Retrieval, , unpublished; Rivaz, P., Kingsbury, N., Complex Wavelet Features for Fast Texture Image Retrieval, , unpublished; MIAS Database, , http://peipa.essex.ac.uk/info/mias.html; Kotsiantis, S.B., Supervised machine learning: A review of classification techniques (2007) University of Peloponnese: Informatica, 31, pp. 249-268. , July; Zhang, L., Lin, F., Zhang, B., Support Vector Machine Learning for Image Retrieval, , IEEE, in press; Rejani, Y.I.A., Selvi, S.T., Digital mammogram segmentation and tumour detection using artificial neural networks (2008) International Journal of Soft Computing, 3, pp. 112-119; Bozek, J., Mustra, M., Delac, K., Grgic, M., A survey of image processing algorithms in digital mammography (2009) Rec.

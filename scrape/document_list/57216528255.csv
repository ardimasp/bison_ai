Generating a report for stakeholders quickly and accurately is highly required in assisting them making a data-driven decision. By developing a data warehouse, it is possible for a company to do a data-driven decision making to appeal to their customer segments. This paper proposes a data warehouse model design to analyse the sales data contained in the database. The method that was implemented for this particular data warehouse development is the nine-step methodology designed by Kimball. The results are then presented in pdf form and an interactive dashboard. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

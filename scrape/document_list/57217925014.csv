To provide fast and precise service, it needed a device that is able to help the operational system at restaurant. This research focus on creating a device that can help operational system at restaurant that can be controlled using the smartphone. The device is designed to combine several components that were merged into a wearable device. The result is wearable devices that can last 7 hours 34 minutes with 2 hours charging time, average operating distance 35.3 m, and 5% error glitch. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Android; Firebase; Restaurant; Wearable Device","Audition; Charging time; Android; Firebase; Hearing impairments; Operational systems; Research focus; Restaurant; Wearable devices; Wearable technology",,,,,"Kristinawati, Y., Akbar, S.R., Maulana, R., (2018) Implementation of Battery Capacity Monitoring Module on Embedded Devices, 2, pp. 3210-3219; Mihardja, E.A., Adeline, A., (2013) The Role of Wireless Table Calling System Technology on Service Quality at Sushi Tei Central Park Restaurant, p. 2; Ngafifi, M., (2014) Advances in Technology and Patterns of Human Life in Socio-Cultural Perspective, 2, pp. 33-47; Susila, T., Winata, T., Rakhman, S.N., (2006) Designing Food Ordering Equipment, 8, pp. 61-68; Wijaya, D., Primananda, R., Data, M., (2018) Analysis of Power Consumption and Performance for Uploading and Downloading Data on Ad-Hoc Networks and Infrastructure Networks on Raspberry Pi', 2, pp. 2504-2512","Susanto, R.; Computer Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: rudy.susanto@binus.ac.id",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

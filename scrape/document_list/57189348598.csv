The implication of this situation is the need for proper information and data collection. Human Resources for Health Information System (HRHIS) works as a tool in collecting such information. The fragmented business process posed a substantial challenge towards any effort in integrating HRHIS with Health Information System (HIS) Data Bank. However, through the simultaneous utilization of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) method for model integration, Health Level Seven (HL 7) for standard data exchange, and Extensible Markup Language (XML) for standard data formatting, this study managed to construct a system model that integrated HRHIS with HIS Data Bank. The model was created subsequently enable the accuracy of HRHIS information. © 2015 IEEE.","Health Information System; HIS; HL 7; SOA","Bioassay; Data integration; Electronic data interchange; Green computing; Hypertext systems; Information services; Information systems; Personnel; Service oriented architecture (SOA); XML; Business Process; Data collection; Extensible Mark-Up language (XML); Health information systems; Health-care system; HL 7; Model integration; Simultaneous utilization; Information use",,,,,"Badan Pengembangan dan Pemberdayaan SDM Kesehatan, (2010) Rencana Aksi Penguatan Sistem Informasi Sumber Daya Manusia Kesehatan Tahun 2011-2014, , Jakarta: BPPSDMK; Firat, K., Moser, L.E., Michael, P., Melliar, S., (2008) Building a Distributed E-Healthcare System Using SOA, pp. 25-26. , Los Alamitos, CA: IT Pro; (2012), http://www.hl7.org, June.

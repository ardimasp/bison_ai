This research examines gamification in Shoppee, one of the biggest e-commerce sites in Indonesia. Based on survey data, this study examines the effect of gamification on different generations (generation X versus Millennials). The study uses a quantitative approach using SEM (Structure Equation Model) with Smart PLS to analyze the data. The result shows that there is a significantly different effect on both generations. Generation X show that perceived usefulness and recognition are an essential aspect of gamification. While for millennials, they show that playfulness and social influence are important factors. © 2020 IEEE.","E-commerce; Gamification; Generation","Electronic commerce; Information management; Different effects; E-commerce sites; Game elements; Perceived usefulness; Quantitative approach; Social influence; Structure equation models; Survey data; Gamification",,,,,"Koivisto, J., Hamari, J., The rise of motivational information systems: A review of gamification research (2019) Int.

The merchant must strive to build trust and minimize the consumer's perceived risk. This study analyzes and evaluates the role of trust and perceived risk on a multidimensional perspective. Based on 400 samples collected through a web-survey, this study found that the dimensions of trust and perceived risk have a different role in affecting purchase intention. For example, the time dimension from variable perceived risk has no effect on the trust. However, the time dimension has significant effects on purchase intention. The findings from this study have important and practical implications for e-commerce in developing their strategies, especially in trust building and risk reduction strategy. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt.

Trust is very important in e-commerce. The nature of online shopping has a greater uncertainty than offline shopping. Seeing as there is an uncertainty that can produce risks, a prospective buyer's trust is needed. A lot of people's unwillingness to shop online is caused by their lack of trust toward e-commerce. E-commerce is said to be one of the ways for SME to compete with bigger companies. However, building trust requires immense time and cost. SME with limited resources may experience difficulties in building trust just with their own resources. Base on literature research that needs to be validated in next research, we found that trust can be built through trust transfer from the reputable and well-known trust-mark issuer, and third party protection such as escrow account service and credit card issuer. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Commerce; Account services; Literature researches; Online shopping; Primary objective; Prospective buyers; Small medium enterprise; Third parties; Trust transfer; Electronic commerce",,,,,"(2014), Google (Jakarta) Online Shopper Study : IDEA Roundtable; (2013) Trust Marks Report 2013 : ""can i Trust the Trust Mark?"", , The European Consumer Centres'Network; (2015) Profil Pengguna Internet Indonesia 2014, , Asosiasi Penyelenggara Jasa Internet Indonesia and Puskakom UI (Jakarta: Pertama); Li, X., Rong, G., Thatcher, J.B., DO we trust the technology?

As a novelty, we introduced the Real-Time Support Assistance (RTOSA) concept as a supplementary moderating variable. This paper constitutes hypothetical development about the proposed RTOSA and contains a brief description of Indonesia largest online community forum that projected as our online experimental research dioramas. This proposed research aims to explore the e-image effect towards consumer willingness to do the online transaction and the seller capability to adjust pricing premium moderated by RTOSA and also product type differences. Six hypotheses were modeled in this research proposal.

However, how if the bank-like service agency operates by the individual, performed online and does not have some guaranteeing assets? How they do warrant their customers that they will not violate the consumer trusts? In addition, did the customers trust them? In this paper appointed a case study of the Rekening Bersama (RekBer) phenomenon as Indonesian ESM. Where, most of them ran the bank-like business without forming a legal entity as a reliable guarantee. In spite of that, we found a unique behavioral pattern that either incorporated RekBer or individual RekBer has the same opportunity to being trusted by their trustors. © 2016 SERSC.","Consumer behavior; E-Business; E-Commerce; Escrow Service of Money; Logistic regression; Management information systems; Online trust; Rekening Bersama (RekBer)","Electronic commerce; Information management; Management information systems; Online systems; eBusiness; Escrow services; Logistic regressions; Online trust; Rekening Bersama (RekBer); Consumer behavior",,,,,"Gökmen, A., Virtual business operations, e-commerce & its significance and the case of Turkey: Current situation and its potential (2012) Electron.

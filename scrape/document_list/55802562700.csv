The purpose of this study is to analyze risks, find out the causes of the risk, and recommend the best mitigation strategies that can be done in the supply chain of SME interior design. The method used for this research is mixed research method and the type of research used is descriptive research. Data analysis was carried out using SCOR level 1 method with HOR approach. Level 1 SCOR is used for activity mapping. The House of Risk (HOR) approach is divided into 2 stages, in which phase 1 begins with identifying the risks of the problems that have been experienced by interior design SMEs in Indonesia. After obtaining the ten cause of risks that exist, measures of severity and correlation will be carried out. Finally, Aggregate Risk Potential (ARP) is calculated to find out the most dangerous cause of risk, which is distance traveled. HOR stage 2 begins with the evaluation of the most dangerous cause of risks from the results of ARP calculations. This stage focuses on choosing the most effective handling strategy, which is to encourage the efficiency of shipping by only making one delivery of goods. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Aggregate risk potential; HOR method; Mitigation; SCOR level 1; Supply chain",,,,,,"Chopra, S., dan Meindl, P., (2013) Supply chain management: Strategy, planning, and operation, , Essex: Pearson Education Limited; Cahyani, Z.D., Wahyu, S.R., Baihaqi, I., Studi Implementasi Model House of Risk (HOR) untuk Mitigasi Risiko Keterlambatan Material dan Komponen Impor pada Pembangunan Kapal Baru (2016) JURNAL TEKNIK ITS, 5 (2); Hugos, M.H., (2011) Essentials of Supply Chain Management, , Canada: John Wiley and Sons, Inc; Bolstroff, P., Rosenbaum, R., (2007) A handbook for dramatic improvement using the, , SCOR model.

One of the horticultural commodities is the potato (Solanum tuberosum). Potatoes are widely used as ingredients in the light meal industry such as potato chips. Restaurants and fast food industry also use potatoes as the ingredients. Wonosobo regency is one of the areas in Java producing a lot of potatoes and the majority of the population work as farmers. The purpose of this research is to find out the network design of potato supply chain in Wonosobo regency in order to design a more effective and efficient one. This research uses the descriptive qualitative method and the processes of collecting data are observation, interview, and documentation. The results suggest that the current supply chain design of potatoes is from farmers, middlemen, retailers, and consumers. An alternative network design proposed is the farmers should channel the lower quality potatoes directly to the retailers. While another alternative is, for the good quality potatoes, the farmers should sell them to cooperative for export. © 2018 Authors.","Design; Export; Indonesia; Potato; Supply chain; Wonosobo regency",,,,,,"Chopra, S., Sodhi, M.S., Managing risk to avoid supply chain breakdown (2004) MIT Sloan Management Review; Chopra, S., Meindl, P., (2001) Supply Chain Management: Strategy, Planning, and Operations, , New Jersey: Prentice Hall; Deep, A., Dani, S., Managing Global Food Supply Chain Risks: A Scenario Planning Perspective (2009) POMS 20th Annual Conference, , Orlando, Florida, POMS Abstract Number: 011-0371; Diaz, L.C., Hansel, J.E., Making Risk sharing models work with farmers, agribusinesses and financial institutions (2007) International Conference on Rural Finance Research: Moving Results into Policies and Practice, pp. 1-55. , FAO.

The methodology includes an empirical study that was conducted in education franchising in Indonesia. The results show that the quality of relational relation is important in improving franchisee performance results. Meanwhile, entrepreneur orientation as a moderator variable gives an effect towards the improvement of franchisee performance. From the four indicators of entrepreneur orientation, in education franchise context in Indonesia, the most required indicator is the courage to take risks. This quality is required by franchisee in increasing franchisee performance because without courage to try new things and find creative ideas, franchisee performance will not improve.

The problem arises when the company is lack of knowledge about what application method to measure its performance and the details as well. The purpose of this research is to provide a balanced scorecard as an application method to measure the aspects of the company so that the company will be able to determine those aspects that have not run maximally in the company more easily. The method used in this research is quantitative method with a descriptive approach. Using analytical hierarchy process as the data processing method to determine the weight that is calculated on the balanced scorecard, the result found that company needs to improve its quality of service by repairing all matters relating to any outside party or consumers. The company also needs to pay attention to the work disciplinary that can be formed directly by regulation, training and the establishment of a conducive working environment.

Secondly, this article also discusses the results of a comparative analysis of the validity and reliability of two studies, namely pilot test and the actual research. Both analyses were conducted through an instrument used to measure the influence of human resource sustainability practice on employee productivity of SMEs through an HR policy. The instrument is based on a research model introduced by Gollan (2000), 'Model factors that influence HR sustainability'. This research does not only attempt to prove that the instrument is strong in terms of content validity (previous studies) but also in terms of construct validity, predictive validity and reliability. The analysis results show that all the variables used in the instruments have a high value of reliability and validity in both studies. In addition, this article indirectly proves that the Gollan (2000) model has empirical proof for future research.

This study was conducted on small and medium companies that produce various products made from soybeans. The problem faced by the company is located in the production process, especially regarding the quality of its products. The purpose of this research is to investigate types of disability and the factors that cause disability issues in the production process. Data are analysed using the six sigma method, which aims to identify and decrease factors that cause disability. Six sigma claims that focussing on reduction of variation will solve process and business problems. By using a set of statistical tools to understand the fluctuation of the process, management can begin to predict the expected outcomes of that process that do not fulfil the standard and texture, caused by human factors, raw materials, production methods, machinery and equipment.

The purpose of this study is to examine relationship between franchisor and franchisee from franchisee perspective in the earlychildhood franchising in Indonesia. In addition, this study was tested how the good relationships between two parties affect satisfaction and performance. Quantitative methods are used in this study with franchisee as the unit of analysis. This study used an online questionnaire because it was taken from the entire city in Indonesia. Data processing was performed using the WarpPLS 3.0 software which can be used for analysis of the structural equation model. Results of this study from 101 online questionnaires declare that apparently in the early childhood education franchise in Indonesia, franchisee will have a good performance if there was good relational quality between two parties backed by entrepreneurial orientation of franchisees. On the other hand, transactional qualities between the two parties do not directly influence the performance, just as antecedent to relational quality. The main practical implication is the entrepreneurial orientation that needs to be owned by a franchisee to be successful in running a franchise business, because entrepreneurial orientation from franchisee has positive effects to relational quality between franchisor and franchisee and also to franchisee performance. This study contributes to the relational quality and entrepreneurial orientation of franchisees that determines the success of the franchise system. © 2015 Academic Journals Inc.","Entrepreneur orientation; Franchising; Indonesia; Performance; Relational quality",,,,,,"(2011) Data franchise of Indonesia, , http://www.franchiseindonesia.org, Asosiasi Franchising Indonesia (AFI), Jakarta, Indonesia; Blau, P.M., (1964) Exchange and Power in Social Life, p. 352. , 1st Edn., John Wiley and Sons, New York, USA; Bradach, J.L., Eccles, R.G., Price, authority and trust: From ideal types to plural forms (1989) Ann.

Cost reduction in procurement of spare parts is the aim of the company. The spare parts in this research are focused in the kind of filters. On the early step, the choosing of priority filter will be studied further by using the ABC analysis. To find out future demand of the filter, this research is using demand forecast by utilizing the QM software for windows. And to find out the best method of inventory control for each kind of filter is by comparing the total cost of Economic Order Quantity and Quick response inventory method. For the three kind of filters which are Cartridge, Engine oil—pn:600-211- 123, Element, Transmission—pn:424-16-11140, and Element, Hydraulic—pn:07063-01054, the best forecasting method is Linear regression. The best method for inventory control of Cartridge, Engine oil—pn:600-211-123 and Element, Transmission—pn:424-16-11140, is Quick Response Inventory, while the best method for Element, Hydraulic—pn:07063-01054 is Economic Order Quantity. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

The result by using 7 tools of quality method finds that there are 6 types of production defects in the company in which 3 of them have high frequency of defect. These defects are caused by several major factors which are machines, men, measurement and environment. In addition, the results also show that the company's production processes are outside the control limits. Therefore, the company is advised to take immediate quality control steps by monitoring the productivity of two main factors that cause defect which are machines and men.

The research methods used in this research is qualitative method. The research was conducted on an educational franchise industry in Indonesia with franchisee as the unit analysis. This study utilizes online questionnaire by taking a sample using simple random sampling. Data analysis was performed using Structural Equation Model (SEM) and processing using program WarpPLS 3.0. Results of this study stated that in the hypothetical sample of education franchise industry in Indonesia, entrepreneur orientation determines the franchisee satisfaction but it does not determine franchisee performance. Further finding showed that entrepreneur orientation is a moderating variable between satisfaction and performance. The main practical implication is the entrepreneurial orientation needs to be owned by a franchisee to be successful in running a franchise business. This study contributes to the entrepreneurial orientation of franchisees determining the success of the franchise system. © Medwell Journals, 2013.","Entrepreneur orientation; Franchising; Indonesia; Performance; Satisfaction",,,,,,"Abdullah, F., Alwi, M.R., Lee, N., Ho, V.B., Measuring and managing franchisee satisfaction: A study of academic franchising (2008) J.

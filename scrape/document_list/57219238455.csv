The purpose of this project is to make use of a wired and wireless network to make a communication system for an electronic information board. RaspberryPi module is used for storing and displaying the data which connected to monitor using HDMI connector. The device that used to send data (laptop) connected to RaspberryPi by UTP Cable (Wired) and/or Wi-Fi (Wireless). Wired network communication has an error presentation 0% while in wireless network is 0,083%. Data transfer in wired and wireless communication generate an exponential curve where the value will increase bigger in a certain size. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

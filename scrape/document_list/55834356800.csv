Our result illustrates that the support vector machine has a 0.92 (92%) accuracy value and a 0.927 (92.7%) precision value. The support vector machine has the highest result, when compared with other classification algorithms. Our novel method uses a static analysis to extract the function call based sensitive function list correctly and not just as a keyword. The source codes that read as a bag of words or read with neuro linguistic programming are prone to a false positive detection. This is because the source code language has different structures compared with the regular language. The source code uses a static analysis to extract its abstract syntax tree structures. © ICIC International 2019.","Classification; Function call; Static analysis; Web shell backdoor",,,,,,"Christianini, N., Shawe-Taylor, J., (2000) An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-Based Learning Methods, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Hagen, B., Behrens, S., (2013) Web Shell Detection Using Neopi; Canali, D., Balzarotti, D., Francillon, A., The role of web hosting providers in detecting compromised websites (2013) Proc. of the 22Nd International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 177-188; Chess, B., West, J., (2007) Secure Programming with Static Analysis, Pearson Education; Cooper, K., Torczon, L., (2011) Engineering a Compiler, , Elsevier; (2011) Php Shell Detector: Web Shell Detection Tool; (2013) R-Fx Network, Linux Malware Detect; Grune, D., van Reeuwijk, K., Bal, H.E., Jacobs, C.J.H., Langendoen, K., (2012) Modern Compiler Design, , Springer Science & Business Media; Hagan, M.T., Demuth, H.B., Beale, M.H., (1996) Neural Network Design, , Pws Pub., Boston; Kim, J., Yoo, D.-H., Jang, H., Jeong, K., Webshark 1.0: A benchmark collection for malicious web shell detection (2015) Journal of Information Processing Systems, 11 (2), pp. 229-238; Xu, M., Chen, X., Hu, Y., Design of software to search ASP web shell (2012) Procedia Engineering, 29, pp. 123-127; (2018) Web Server Survey, 2018. , January; Rish, I., An empirical study of the naive Bayes classifier (2001) IJCAI 2001 Workshop on Empirical Methods in Artificial Intelligence, 3, pp. 41-46; Safavian, S.R., Landgrebe, D., A survey of decision tree classifier methodology (1991) IEEE Trans.

In addition, in the E-Learning learning system we must also provide accurate and accurate information. The research method used is literature study and analysis. Literature study was carried out on the face of face detection and recognition in real-Time conditions carried out by various previous studies. Furthermore, analysis was carried out in a literature study studio to find suitable methods for the E-Learning environment. From the results of existing literature studies we recommend face detection using Face Countour and the Adaboost Algorithm added to CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)to normalize the facial contour function and normalize lightning in the surrounding environment where a face detection is located. The process is carried out, we use the 3WPCA-MD(Three-Level Wavelet Decomposition Principal Component Analysis with Mahalonobis Distance) method which is able to produce calculations, that is, face recognition that is faster when compared to ordinary PCA (Principal Component Analysis) methods. Thus the process can be carried out in face detection and face recognition. © 2018 IEEE.","e-learning; face recognition; facedetecton","Adaptive boosting; Authentication; Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Information management; Neural networks; Principal component analysis; Wavelet decomposition; Convolutional neural network; E-learning environment; Face detection and recognition; facedetecton; Literature reviews; Mahalonobis distance; PCA (principal component analysis); Surrounding environment; Face recognition",,,,,"Rabiha, S.G., Ham, S.H., Noerlina, Hendro, Image processing model based e-learning for students authentication (2017) International Conference on Information Management and Technology (ICIMTech, pp. 187-191. , no.

Our novel method successfully restructured the PHP parser and reduced grammar artifact objects that must be visited in a taint analysis process by up to 52% grammar variation. Taint analysis is an analysis that detects any injection vulnerability pattern in source code. The analysis identifies the information flow of untrustworthy input that affects the sensitive sink or part of the system. The static taint analysis was run on an abstract syntax tree and traversed all nodes. A static taint analysis uses a parser to traverse abstract syntax trees of the source code. A web PHP parser has 140 grammar combinations in an abstract syntax tree, which has to be traversed to recognize the tainted flow pattern. Additionally, there are many variations of syntax and coding styles for tainted flow patterns. Therefore, the amount of combinations will consume many computation resources. © 2018 The Authors.

Encryption algorithms that widely used in information security are asymmetric and symmetric. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is one of symmetric encryption that most used often and the most secure encryption today. However, AES encryption has slow computation. Our experiment show that both of algorithms combination needs 3.045 milliseconds for 1024 bytes of data and increase 3-4 milliseconds for 2048 bytes of data and so on. This paper proposes a novelty method to improve AES algorithm with Shift Row and S.Box modification for Mix Column transformation. The result show that our optimization has reduced 3 milliseconds and continue to increase as the number of bytes increases. Percentage average of the optimization is 86.143%. © 2017 The Authors.

The lemma and sub lemma of Indonesian Language have been grown and absorb from foreign languages or Indonesian traditional languages. Our approach provides the easy way of stemming Indonesian language through flexibility affix classification. Therefore, the affix additional can be applied in easy way. We experiment with 1,704 text documents with 255,182 tokens and the stemmed words is 3,648 words. In this experiment, we compare our approach performance to the confix-stripping approach performance.

Energy requirement is determined based on Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)—which is affected by weights, heights, age and gender—and physical activity level (PAL). While energy intake is calculated based on calorie from each portion of food consumed. This food consists of five principal elements, namely main dish, vegetable side dish, meat, vegetable and fruit. In the daily life, the difference between energy requirement and energy intake must be set as minimum as possible in order to avoid overweight or underweight condition. However, an individual is still having difficulty in determining the ideal portion of every kind of food that will be consumed in everyday. Therefore it is important to develop a system which gives the information regarding an optimal portion of each kind of food for an individual consumption. Genetic Algorithm(GA) is used to find the best portion and composition of food so that it will provide a proportional energy intake according to individual requirement. In the analysis we compare the results from GA and linear programming approach, the experiment shows that GA is succeed in giving proportional portion and composition as well as providing the diversity of food based on individual requirement. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Energy intake; Energy requirement; Food suggestion; Genetic algorithm; Nutrition","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Intelligent systems; Linear programming; Nutrition; Vegetables; Daily activity; Daily lives; Energy intake; Energy requirements; Genetic algorithm approach; Metabolic rates; Physical activity levels; Genetic algorithms",,,,,"Amine, E., Baba, N., Belhadj, M., Deurenbery-Yap, M., Djazayery, A., Forrester, T., Galuska, D., Yoshiike, N., (2003) Introduction.

The growing of sophisticated technology has eased people's productivity. However, in the other hand, security risks have also grown without an equal degree of awareness of the society. The objective of this research is to design and develop an Android application that is able to draw a topology of a network and do a simple security assessment towards a host in order to detect host's vulnerability. The information gathered will be presented in a PDF report and can be used for maintenance purposes. The application will have wizard feature, where the user can analyze network and discover an underlying vulnerability with guided steps. The methodology is interview, literature study, observation and system design using object oriented approach. DroidGlance, an Android application that can draw a wireless network topology generator and help security tester analyze a host's vulnerability. The application main feature are Topology generator, Ping, Traceroute, Port Scanner, Vulnerability Checker, and Listen. These features are tested. These features are able to run well. However, they need several improvements for future development. © 2014 SERSC.","Android; Network; Security; Topology",,,,,,"Vanaubel, Y., Pansiot, J.J., Merindol, P., Donnet, B., Network fingerprinting: TTL-based router signatures (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 conference on Internet measurement conference, pp. 369-376. , New York: ACM New York; A penetration tester's toolkit (2012) Linux Journal, 213 (1). , 2012; Bauer, M., Paranoid Penguin: Checking Your Work with Scanners, Part I (of II): nmap (2001) Linux Journal, 13 (85 ES). , 2001; Barnett, J.R., Irwin, B., Towards a Taxonomy of Network Scanning Techniques (2008) Proceedings of the 2008 annual research conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists on IT research in developing countries: riding the wave of technology, pp. 1-7. , New York: ACM New York; Bartlett, G., Heidemann, J., Papadopoulos, C., Understanding passive and active service discovery (2007) Proceedings of the 7th ACM SIGCOMM conference on Internet measurement, pp. 57-70. , New York: ACM New York; Chakrabarti, S., Chakraborty, M., Mukhopadhyay, I., Study of snort-based IDS (2010) Proceedings of the International Conference and Workshop on Emerging Trends in Technology, pp. 43-47. , New York: ACM; Ehrenkranz, T., Li, J., On the state of IP spoofing defense (2009) Journal ACM Transactions on Internet Technology, 9 (2); Hytnen, R., Garcia, M., An analysis of wireless security (2006) Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges, pp. 210-216; Richardson, W.D., Gribble, D.S., Kohno, T., The limits of automatic OS fingerprint generation (2010), pp. 24-34. , New York: ACM; Treurniet, J., A network activity classification schema and its application to scan detection (2011) Journal IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON), 19 (5), pp. 1396-1404; Ali, S., Heriyanto, T., BackTrack 4: Assuring Security by Penetration Testing.

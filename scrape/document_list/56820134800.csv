This research aims to design and develop an application which lets users monitoring TransJakarta bus position with utilizing public data acquired from passengers’ phone GPS. It is not only from inside the bus stops, but everywhere as long as there is an internet connection. Users in buses will be able to supply additional road information, such as traffic jams, accidents and hazards to the public such that people waiting in the bus will not only know their next bus’ position but also the bus’ current status. The result of this research will be a prototype application which utilizes GPS, WebSockets, jQuery Mobile and Google Maps Services. The prototype application will only be designed to run on Android and Web platform(s). © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

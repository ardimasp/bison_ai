A weight limitation system is proposed to make sure the vehicle weight is always below its designation prior the vehicle is being used by the driver. The proposed system is divided into two systems, namely vehicle weight confirmation system and weight warning system. In vehicle weight confirmation system, the weight sensor work for the first time after the ignition switch is turned on. When the weight is under the weight limit, the starter engine can be switched on to start the engine system, otherwise it will be locked. The seconds system, will operated after checking all the door at close position, once the door of the car is closed, the weight warning system will check once again the weight during runing engine condition. The results of these two systems, vehicle weight confirmation system and weight warning system have 100 % accuracy, respectively. These show that the proposed vehicle weight limitation system operate well. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Aerospace engineering; Automobile safety devices; Engines; Safety factor; Confirmation systems; Engine conditions; Engine systems; Transportation safety; Vehicle weights; Weight limitations; Weight limits; Weight sensors; Vehicles",,,,,"Compilation of Existing State Truck Size and Weight Limit Laws (2016) J.

There are some problems regarding lack of equipment, product defects and distances between facilities that impact for delayed. The Operation Process Chart (OPC), Multi Product Process Chart (MPPC), and Routing sheet utilized to map the main problem in the facility. Activity Relationship Chart (ARC) method, Dimensionless Block Diagram, Activity Relationship Diagram (ARD), and aisle method applied in design new layout facility to improve its effectiveness. The proposed layout efficiency level is 55.7% compared to the current layout. This research is expected to solve the problem which become one of the main focus point at PT Sendanis Jaya Makmur. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Activity Relationship Diagram (ARD); Dimensionless Block Diagram; Multi Product Process Chart (MPPC); Operation Process Chart (OPC); Routing sheet, Activity Relationship Chart (ARC)","Costs; Defects; Block diagrams; Efficiency levels; Focus points; Multi-products; Operation process; Product defects; Production cost; Routing sheet, Activity Relationship Chart (ARC); Facilities",,,,,"Haslindah, (2013) Analisa Pengendalian Mutu Minuman Rumput Laut Dengan Menggunakan Metode Fishbone Chart Pada PT Jasuda di Kabupaten Takalar ILTEK7, p. 1008; Stavenny, N., Nasution, S.R., Andres, (2017) Usulan Perbaikan Tata Letak Pabrik di PT, , http://dosen.univpancasila.ac.id/dosenfile/4404230008151090547117November2017.pdf, Media Kertasindo Utama undergraduate thesis; Nurhasana, S., Perbaikan Rancangan Tata Letak Lantai Produksi di CV.

One of the PR strategies often used to disseminate information on a product is to work with bloggers. This was due to the power owned by bloggers who serve as online opinion leaders. This study was conducted to determine the role of bloggers in PR activities in Indonesia and to reveal their engagement process as digital influencers on social media. The current study employed observation of blog posts and semi-structured interviews with eight bloggers who had been involved in PR activities. Data reduction was used to analize the data display and data verification/conclusion. The results showed that the communication patterns of digital influencers through social media applied a multi-step flow of communication model. Furthermore, bloggers engagement in the PR activities was mutually beneficial relationship as they become directly involved in either product review, event, or campaign. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Blogger; Digital influencer; Multi step flow; Public relations; Social media",,,,,,"Aggarwal, C.C., Lin, S., Yu, P.S., On influential node discovery in dynamic social networks (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining, pp. 636-647. , April.

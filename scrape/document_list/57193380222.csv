Previous studies showed that interactive website service, motivation to use the website, Internet literacy and user satisfaction were related to consumer behaviour. Therefore, this research considered user satisfaction as an intervening variable. Analysis of the six hypotheses used the Structure Equation Model with the analytical tool, WrapPLS, for both groups. The respondents were sampled from online students, numbering 274 respondents from two universities and regular students numbering 317 respondents from six universities. The results show that the online student's behaviour was diffused more by the innovation of the website rather than that of the regular students. Furthermore, student's satisfaction served as an intervening variable, which means that student's satisfaction is a must for universities to consider. Moreover, data provided by the online students showed that website interaction for student behaviour was not significant. The student behaviour was not significant to the scale of diffusion of innovation websiteThe five other hypotheses support the theory of diffusion innovation on consumer behaviour. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Comparative; Consumer behaviour; Diffuse; Innovation website; Online students; Regular students",,,,,,"Adler, P.S., Market, hierarchy, and trust: The knowledge economy and the future of capitalism (2001) Organization Science, 12 (2), pp. 215-234; Bagozzi, R.P., Hsiung, R.O., Interactions in small groups: The social relations model (1994) Relationship Marketing: Theory, Method and Applications, pp. 1-10. , In J.

It is important in the business environment to work with the internet and where information sent and received has more types of threats and vulnerabilities. This paper wants to discuss two methods for assessing information system security risks in financial technology institutions. The methods to be discussed are the VECTOR Matrix method and the OCTAVE Allegro method. The VECTOR method is a security risk assessment method used to prioritize critical risks. While the method for carrying out a more detailed level of security risk analysis, it is recommended to use the OCTAVE Allegro approach. What IS security practices can learn is the reason for choosing the VECTOR Matrix and OCTAVE Allegro method. That these two methods are complementary during the information security risk assessment process in the business environment. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

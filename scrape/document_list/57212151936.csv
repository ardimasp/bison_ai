Therefore, a new solution for modern agriculture is needed to overcome this problem. Technology is useful for modern agriculture, such as the use of IoT for hydroponic farming systems. By using IoT with a smart controlling system, the hydroponic agriculture becomes easier. With the use of IoT in this research, nutrition, pH management, and temperature can be controlled easily. This research also uses fuzzy logic to make the decision making in the control system more efficient and precise. The results of experiments with bok choy and lettuce indicate that the system automatically measures the nutritional value and pH according to the time specified. Then, the system will immediately adjust the value of nutrient content and pH within the specified range. Smart control system shows better plant growth which can be seen from the growth of the leaves’ width, length and plant’s height. © 2020 ICIC International.","Fuzzy logic; Hydroponics; IoT; Smart controlling systems; Urban farming","Agriculture; Computer circuits; Control systems; Decision making; Internet of things; Nutrition; Plants (botany); Agricultural land; Agricultural productions; Controlling system; Hydroponics; Modern agricultures; Nutritional value; Smart control systems; Urban farming; Fuzzy logic",,,,"038/VR","Acknowledgment.

Technically, most encryption processes are ranging from hundreds of milliseconds. If there is a lot of encrypting process, then the performance will be getting bottleneck and the transaction's speed is being slowed down. In this paper, a promising scheme by adding GZIP compression on the former RSA encryption method to increase speed is proposed; thus every transaction is going to require less times, therefore the number of failed transactions or requests will be reduced. Hence, this way makes the transaction easier for customers to do. The result of little experimental test shows that using XOR to stream cipher-text to replace the absent of padding into specific bytes shows a lot of performance increase resulting other factors such as availability also affected without sacrificing the security level. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Risk management; Systems engineering; Application Servers; Experimental test; RSA encryption; Security level; Stream Ciphers; Cryptography",,,,,,,"Rachmawati, D., Budiman, M.A., Lubis, R.S., (2018) IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 434, pp. 1-6; Baheti, A., Singh, L., Khan, A.U., (2014) IEEE-Fourth International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies, pp. 664-668; Ahmed, M., Sazzad, T.M.S., Mollah, M.E., (2012) Int J Comput Sci Issues, 9, pp. 583-586; Klein, M., (2012) The TSEC/KW-26 (1st Ed.)

In Hydroponics agriculture, there is a challenge of precision agriculture, especially for some sensitive plants, e.g., bok choy and lettuce. These kinds of plants need a precise amount of nutrient and water every time to grow ideally. Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a technology that enables regular monitoring of every aspect of human life. It can be a solution to monitor the water and nutrition needs of the plants periodically. In this paper, we propose a monitoring and controlling system for hydroponics precision agriculture based on the IoT concept and Fuzzy logic. IoT is utilized to enable regular monitoring of plants nutrition and water needs, while fuzzy logic is used to control the supply of nutrition and water to the plants. The experiment result shows that the proposed system can produce better growth for lettuce and bok choy plants in terms of the size of leaves. © 2019 IEEE.","Fuzzy logic; Hydroculture; Hydroponics; IoT","Computer circuits; Fuzzy logic; Monitoring; Nutrition; Plants (botany); Precision agriculture; Agricultural land; Agricultural productions; Hydroculture; Hydroponics; Intelligent monitoring; Internet of Things (IOT); Monitoring and controlling System; Sensitive plants; Internet of things",,,,"038/VR","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia, as a part of Penelitian Tesis Magister Research Grant titled “Pertanian Hidroponik Cerdas berbasis Internet-of-things dan Fuzzy Logic” with contract number: 038/VR.RTT/IV/2019nadocntract date: 29 April2019.",,"Yolanda, D., Hindersah, H., Hadiatna, F., Triawan, M.A., Implementation of real-time fuzzy logic control for nft-based hydroponic system on internet of things environment (2016) 2016 6th International Conference on System Engineering and Technology (ICSET), pp. 153-159; Cometti, N.N., Bremenkamp, D.M., Galon, K., Hell, L.R., Zanotelli, M.F., Cooling and concentration of nutrient solution in hydroponic lettuce crop (2013) Hortic.

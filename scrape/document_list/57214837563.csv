Because we want this database to be accessible anywhere at any time, it is safe to conclude that an internet-based (web-based) database would work best, therefore we chose MySQL as the database management system. Before diving deep into the making of the database itself, it is important to understand certain basics of database design and the phases of the database life cycle itself. This paper will conclude on a few of the basic things to understand before designing a database for Human Resource Management on MySQL. © 2019 ASTES Publishers.

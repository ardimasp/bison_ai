DC Motor is still highly needed in industrial world, for applications that needs goods' movement in the process line. Therefore, in this paper, it is important to do simulation before real-world electronic circuit is developed. Thereby we promote green eco-friendly environment, by reducing electronic waste caused by prototyping. The simulation of DC Motor is divided into three (3) parts. First, a simplified DC motor model is assumed, and then the effect of inductance and inertia of the DC motor are considered. Lastly, a small perturbation is noticeable in the output of the electrical DC motor, and after a careful insight into the slip-ring mechanical inside of the DC motor, the effect of it is added in the final simulation model. This gradual modelling methodology certainly helps students to correlate between DC motor modelling with the sampled real-world data, which is taken directly from the experimental laboratory. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","DC Motor; LTSpice; Simulation","Electric machine theory; Eco-friendly; Experimental laboratory; LTSpice; Modelling methodology; Motor simulation; Simulation; Simulation model; Small perturbations; DC motors",,,,,,"Jenni, F., Simulation tool (CERN-2006-010) Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland (2006) CAS - CERN Accelerator School and CLRC Daresbury Laboratory: Specialised CAS Course on Power Converters, pp. 363-384; Wu, H., Wang, C., Zhang, C., Design of Servo Controller for Flying Shear (2014) Journal of Networks, 9, p. 3038; LTspice, , https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html, [Online]; Pederson, D., A historical review of circuit simulation (1984) IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems, 31 (1), pp. 103-111; Schiop, A., Popescu, V., Pspice simulation of power electronics circuit and induction motor drives (2007) Rev.

The most advantage of using Scilab, as a simulation tool is that it is an open source software. Thereby it is very suitable for our laboratory condition, where budgets are very tied and our students would certainly could not afford a proprietary simulation software such as Matlab, i.e. already well-known in academia and industry. In this paper, a full feature PID Model, namely advanced PID Model is described and simulated, to introduce the importance of PID control in industrial. By understanding these advances in PID control, students are aware of their usage as a prime mover in industrial world. This paper starts with anti-windup, command weightings, derivative term replacement, and autotuning relay-feedback using descriptive function, that finally form a full feature advanced PID model. By using this advanced PID model, it will promote green technology for industrial applications, by consuming fewer energy due to highly efficient design. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","advanced PID; anti-windup; autotuning relay; DC Motor; green technology; Scilab; Simulation","Budget control; Energy efficiency; Environmental technology; MATLAB; Open source software; Open systems; Proportional control systems; Three term control systems; advanced PID; Anti-windup; Autotuning; Green technology; Scilab; Simulation; DC motors",,,,,,"Hagglund, T., Signal filtering in PID control (2012) IFAC Proceedings Volumes, 45 (3), pp. 1-10; Mattavelli, P., Tubiana, L., Zigliotto, M., Simple control autotuning for PMSM drives based on feedback relay (2005) European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications, IEEE, p. 10; Astrom, K.J., Hagglund, T., Astrom, K.J., Advanced PID control (2006) ISA-The Instrumentation, Systems, and Automation Society Research Triangle; Putra, Y.H., Tuning Methods of PID Controller, , https://elib.unikom.ac.id/files/disk1/389/jbptunikompp-gdl-yeffryhand-19448-13-bab13.pdf, [Online] [Accessed 31 08 2019]; Kothare, M.V., Campo, P.J., Morarsi, M., Nett, C.N., A unified framework for the study of anti-windup designs (1994) Automatica, 30 (12), pp. 1869-1883; Toochinda, D., (2011) Digital PID Controllers, , https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/?get_group_doc=4784/1393258757-DigitalPIDControllers_2011.pdf, June [Online] [Accessed 31 08 2019]; (2010) Ziegler-Nichols' Open-Loop Method, , http://techteach.no/publications/articles/zn_open_loop_method/zn_open_loop_method.pdf, 17 July [Online] [Accessed 31 8 2019]","Linggarjati, J.; Computer Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: jimmyl@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Surabaya in East Java has several amusement parks that cater for low budgets and they have good-quality equipment and are safe to use. The purpose of this research is to show the results of building a low-cost amusement park. The amusement park was built by a player in the amusement park industry in collaboration with the Computer Engineering Department of Bina Nusantara University. An infinity mirror room (IMR) was built in one of the new amusement parks in Surabaya called Suroboyo Night Carnival. The full design of the IMR is discussed in this paper including the equipment used in the design. The IMR mainly uses fibre optics, LED and a mirror. The amusement park began operation on July 28, 2013, and the amount spent on one room was around US$8,500. No safety breaches have been reported. The facility has been able to attract 500 visitors on average from 2013 to 2016.

Consequently, a system was built to provide a solution by creating a web-based application and using Global System for Mobile (GSM)-based communication with a Global Positioning System (GPS) module and an accelerometer sensor as a vehicle tracker. The embedded system hidden in the motor vehicle also aims to detect any hard impact from a collision or fall; it then sends the GPS coordinates to individuals who need to be contacted in case of an emergency. The web-based system collects the GPS coordinates of the motor vehicle on a periodic basis to allow tracking to determine the location of the vehicle if stolen. Setup, activation, and tracking of a motor vehicle can be performed by vehicle owners using an Android-based mobile phone. This study reviews the literature and laboratory studies to determine the system settings that will be connected to the internet as an implementation of the Internet of Things. The results are expected to help owners locate their vehicles and provide assistance requests when accidents occur.","Embedded systems; GPS; Internet of things; Motor vehicle tracker",,,,,,,"Beman, S., Falentino, S., Liawatimena, S., Perancangan Sistem Keamanan Sepeda Motor Dengan Sistem Sidik Jari.

The CNC machine has good flexibility where its head can be changed manually and easily between pen (impact-engraver) mounted and CO2 laser mounted. The choice will depend on the application that is chosen by the user. The software that is used is basically from open source software and its precision is ""what you see is what you get"" (WYSIWYG). Some creative applications are successfully performed as shown in this paper, and its lower-production cost is favorable for small-medium industry. By the year 2014, this machine will be produced in a mass production and will be marketable in Indonesia. © 2012 IIJ.","CNC machine; CO2 laser head; Creative industry applications; Impact-engraver; Interchangeable head; Pen head",,,,,,,"Wright, M.R., Platts, D.E., French, D.B., Traicoff, G., Dupont, M.A., Head, G.A., (1995) CNC Control System Patents, , US patent 545393, Sep 26; McKilliam, G., (2012) CNC Overview White Paper, , Industrial Automation Series Ltd., Oct; Zhiming, G., Sheng, H., Haoand, Z., Xiaoqi, C., CNC Laser Marking on Freeform Surfaces without Prior Geometrical Information (2002) Proc. 2002 IEEE/RSJ Intl.

Studies show that innovation is one of key factor for firms’ survival, success and sustainable competitive advantages. Leadership is reported to be one of the most important predictors of innovation. Transformational Leadership style is considered as the most suitable type of leadership which can influence innovation. However, the impact of transformational leadership to innovation is not consistent. Recognizing that innovation is a complex concept which requires to both explore and exploit in a non-linear sequence, therefore it is not enough for leader to have only one specific leadership style. Ambidextrous leadership style, which has both opening and closing leadership behaviours, is considered to be more effective in the work of innovation. This study aims to provide further empirical evidence of the link between ambidextrous leadership style with team creativity and innovation as well as relationship between team creativity and team innovation and how team innovation influences team performance. Quantitative descriptive study was conducted to 144 senior staff and managers from various industry in several cities in Indonesia. Structured questionnaire was designed for respondent to rate their leaders leadership style, team creativity, team innovation and team performance. Data was analysed was using SEM-AMOS. The result of the study showed that there were positive links between ambidextrous leadership to team creativity and to team innovation. Positive relationship was also confirmed between team creativity and team innovation. This study also confirm the influence of team innovation to team performance. This study contribute to ambidextrous leadership theory as well as leadership to innovation literature, especially in Indonesia context. The managerial contribution is giving insight to organization how important for leader to be able to explore and exploit in the work of innovation. © 2020 SERSC.","Ambidextrous leadership; Leadership style; Team creativity; Team innovation",,,,,,"Leitner, K.-H., Warnke, P., Rhomberg, W., New forms of innovation: Critical issues for future pathways (2016) Foresight, 18 (3), pp. 224-237; Atalay, M., Anafarta, N., Sarvanc, F., The relationship between innovation and firm performance: An empirical evidence from Turkish automotive supplier industry (2013) Procedia-Soc.

It is essential for a company to make its employees satisfied and pleased with their jobs. These very satisfaction and pleasure are hoped to serve as a key for motivating employees to perform and contribute their best for the company. Numerous research studies have proven the positive effect of work well-being on job performance, but the findings came with inconsistencies and controversies. This fact has caused reluctance in a good many companies to invest in their employees’ work well-being. A survey of 509 millennial employees in the Indonesian startup digital industry was conducted in this research. The results show that employee’s work well-being had a significant, positive effect on job performance. Theoretically, this research has contributed in responding to inconsistencies in literature. It is hoped that this research will also offer practical contribution to individual employees as well as human resources department and increase company executives’ confidence in making organization-related strategic decisions to attain sustainable performance. Finally, we propose a number of intervention suggestions for performance improvement through work well-being. © 2020 by the authors;","Industrial Revolution; Job Performance; Millennial; Sustainable Performance; Work Well-being",,,,,,"Albuquerque, A.S., Troccoli, B.T., Development a measure of subjective well-being (2004) Psicologia, 20, pp. 153-164; Amelia, A., (2018) Employer Branding: When HR Is the New Marketing, , Jakarta, Indonesia: Penerbit Buku Kompas; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review of recommended two step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 411-423; (2012) Creating People Advantage: Mastering HR Challenges in A Two Speed World, , BCG; Bouckenooghe, D., Raja, U., Butt, A.N., Combined effect of positive and negative affectivity and job satisfaction on job performance and turnover intentions (2013) Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied, 147 (2), pp. 105-123; Campbell, J.P., Modeling the performance prediction problem in industrial and organizational psychology (1990) Handbook of Industrial and Organizational Psychology, pp. 687-732. , Dalam M.

The money involves in charitable giving is a huge. Business has tapping into this opportunity with program such as Cause Related Marketing (CRM). Firms introduced as approach to combine act of giving & business purpose so that customers view purchasing as a prosocial behavior. Currently there is still limited measures available to assess generosity construct, especially in Indonesia. Two quantitative studies to review the validity and reliability of two type generosity measures were conducted, pilot study which involves 42 samples and extension study which involves 200 samples. Structured questionnaires which distributed online was used as instrutment of the studies. The result of data analysis with SPSS shows that Buhrow’s Generosity scale is valid but not reliable in both pilot and extension studies. However, IG Scale from Smith and Hill is reliable and valid. Reviewing the items of both scales reveals that some items in Buhrow’s scale were not common term and common practice in Indonesia. Therefore, culture fit context should be an important consideration in choosing generosity scale. IG Scale from Smith and Hill is suitable to measure generosity in Indonesia. © 2019 SERSC.","Generosity; Reliability; Scale; Validity",,,,,,"Aronson, S.E., Wilson, T.D., Sommers, S.R., (2015) Prosocial Behavior: Why Do People Help, pp. 357-380. , Social Psychology (9th ed., Pearson; Buhrow, W.C., Bufford, R., Webb, K., (2010) Preliminary Validation of a Measure of Generosity, pp. 1-2. , Digital Commons @George Fox University; Collett, J.L., Morrissey, C.A., The Social Psychology of Generosity: The State of Current Interdisciplinary Research (2007) Report for the John Templeton Foundation Generosity Planning Project.–45 P, 15 (2001), pp. 2008-2009; Corcoran, K.E., Thinkers and feelers: Emotion and giving (2015) Social Science Research, 52, pp. 686-700. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2014.10.008; Dwidienawati, D., Abdinagoro, S.B., Does Generosity Influence Intention to Continue Paying Insurance Premium?

In the digital business industry, innovative work behaviour has been considered as a key performance indicator. Individual performance becomes the basis of the company performance which will further increase the value of the company. This study employs the paradigm of positive psychology, focusing on how performance improvement can be achieved by increasing employee work well-being. Previous studies show that there is an inconsistency in the relationship between work well-being and performance. So, it needs to be understood further through the role of mediation variables that can explain when an employee work wellbeing can improve performance. This study aims to examine the role of employee organisational commitment as a mediator of the relationship between employee work well-being and innovative work behaviour. Taking the digital business industry in Indonesia as a research context, this research reveals that employee organisational commitment fully mediated the relationship between employee work well-being and innovative work behaviour.

This results in many people losing the opportunity and opportunity to get information about healthy foods that are suitable for consumption, especially for people with chronic diseases. Culinary currently in great demand by many people and business people in the field of culinary can help the community in developing and encouraging national economic growth. Application of various Indonesian recipes using Visual Basic programming language. Testing using FGD, black box, and McCall. The goal is to create and design cooking applications based on the types of chronic diseases that can be used by doctors, midwives, nutritionists and the wider community who have chronic illnesses to know what foods or foods can be consumed or for anyone who just wants to know different types of cooking for people with chronic disease. The second target of the study was to assist doctors, midwives, health inspectors and nutritionists in determining healthy foods for chronic pain and nutritional adequacy for the sick. The system will convey information about the types of chronic diseases along with diet and types of dishes or foods that may be consumed by patients with chronic diseases in which case the authors prescribe them with ingredients. With this system the wider community, doctors, midwives, health inspectors and nutritionists easily obtain the required information without having to memorize one by one cooking / food for patients with chronic illness. The level of software quality decision-making system chooses to cook based on the overall type of chronic disease in the Good criteria, with a percentage of 69.90%.

Most heart attacks occur in patients caused by high blood pressure symptoms of undiagnosed. Hypertensive retinopathy Symptoms such as arteriolar narrowing, retinal haemorrhage and cotton wool spots. Based on this reasons, the early diagnosis of the symptoms of hypertensive retinopathy is very urgent to aim the prevention and treatment more accurate. This research aims to develop a system for early detection of hypertension retinopathy stage. The proposed method is to determine the combined features artery and vein diameter ratio (AVR) as well as changes position with Optic Disk (OD) in retinal images to review the classification of hypertensive retinopathy using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Boltzmann Machines approach. We choose this approach of because based on previous research DNN models were more accurate in the image pattern recognition, whereas Boltzmann machines selected because It requires speedy iteration in the process of learning neural network. The expected results from this research are designed a prototype system early detection of hypertensive retinopathy stage and analysed the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed methods. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Blood pressure; Blood vessels; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Iterative methods; Ophthalmology; Pattern recognition; Boltzmann machines; Combined features; Cotton-wool spots; Early diagnosis; High blood pressures; Image pattern recognition; Process of learning; Prototype system; Eye protection",,,,,"Samra, I., Muhammad, S., Akram, M.U., Ubaidullah, Y., Automated detection of Cotton Wool Spots for the diagnosis of Hypertensive Retinopathy (2015) Proceedings of the 7 Th Cairo International Biomedical Engineering Conference, CIBEC., pp. 121-124. , (2015); Moor, H.J., What Is Computer Ethics?

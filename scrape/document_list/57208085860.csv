This paper provides methods to fasten the reporting process by making a data warehouse using Kimball and ross method. Data warehouse consists of 9 step methodology designed by Kimball and Ross. This paper devoted for business processes in e-commerce especially for online cellphone balance top-up transactions. Furthermore, data can be displayed in a form such as a dashboard, and also in a simple, informative and effective report. © 2019 IEEE.","Data Warehouse; E-commerce; Kimball; Online Transaction","Data warehouses; Decision support systems; Telephone sets; Best decision; Business Process; Cell phone; Credit transactions; Decision supports; Kimball; Online transaction; Reporting systems; Electronic commerce",,,,,"Su, S.T., Needamangala, A., Harvesting information from a library data warehouse (2017) ITAL, 19 (1), pp. 17-28; Girsang, A.S., Decision support system using data warehouse for hotel reservation system (2017) SIET, pp. 369-373; Murphy, S.N., Combining clinical and genomics queries using i2b2-three methods (2017) PLoS One, 12 (4), pp. 1-16; Abello, A., Using semantic web technologies for exploratory olap : a survey (2015) IEEE Trans.

Comparison of several machine learning, feature extraction approaches, and parameter optimization was done to achieve the best accuracy. This paper proposes an approach to extracting comparison value of sentiment review using three features extraction: Word2vec, Doc2vec, Terms Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) with machine learning classification algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes and Decision Tree. Grid search algorithm is used to optimize the feature extraction and classifier parameter. The performance of these classification algorithms is evaluated based on accuracy. The approach that is used in this research succeeded to increase the classification accuracy for all feature extractions and classifiers using grid search hyperparameter optimization on varied pre-processed data. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.","Doc2vec; Grid search; Sentiment analysis; TF-IDF (terms frequency-inverse document frequency); Word2vec",,,,,,"Joshi, N.S., Itkat, S.A., (2014) A Survey on Feature Level Sentiment Analysis, 5 (4), pp. 5422-5425; Vateekul, P., Koomsubha, T., A study of sentiment analysis using deep learning techniques on Thai Twitter data (2016) 2016 13th Int.

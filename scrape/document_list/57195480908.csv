There are three analyzed districts: Tanjung Pandan (TJQ), Palembang (PLM), and Jakarta (CGK). The research uses information system's success model proposed by Delone and McLean. The research will analyze the factors that measure the success of using DeLone & McLean model of success information systems. Data from 53 respondents were collected through a survey, then the author created a path with the Partial Least Squares (PLS) path analysis using the software SmartPLS (v.3.2.6). The results of this study proved that the information quality variable did not significantly affect use variable, the information quality variable had no significant effect on the user satisfaction variable and the service quality variable had no significant effect on the use variable, while the other variables were tested significant in measuring the success of the use of information systems with R-square value that has a moderate effect of user satisfaction variable by 0.577, the use variable by 0.396, and a net benefit variable by 0.615. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Information analysis; Information systems; Least squares approximations; Manufacture; Regression analysis; Indonesia; Information quality; Partial least square (PLS); Path analysis; R square; Service Quality; Success models; User satisfaction; Surveys",,,,,"Ullianjari, A., (2015) Proses Konversi Sistem Informasi Pada Perusahaan, , (Bogor: MB-IPB Program Pasca Sarjana Manajemen dan Bisnis); Seddon Peter, B., A Respecification and Extension of the DeLone and McLean Model of IS Success (1997) Information Systems Research, 8 (3), pp. 240-253; DeLone, W.H., McLean, E.R., The Delone and McLean Model of Information Systems Success: A Ten-Year Update (2003) Journal of Management System, 9; Sundari, R., (2005) Teaching Materials Amp; Files Implementasi Sistem Informasi, , http://staffsite.gunadarma.ac.id, Universitas Gunadarma, teaching materials and files diakses 8 maret 2017; Suchban, N., Siti, E., Kertahadi, (2012) Mengukur Efektivitas Sistem Informasi Dan Mengetahui Kesuksesan Portal Akademik (Siam) on Line Ejournalfia, pp. 4-6. , (Studi Kasus Terhadap Pengguna di Program Pendidikan Vokasi Universitas Brawijaya); Sofyan Yamin, H.K., (2014) Generasi Baru Mengelola Data Penelitian Dengan Partial Least Square Path Modeling: Aplilasi Dengan Software XLSTAT, SmartPLS, Dan Visual PLS, , (Jakarta: Salemba Infotek)",,"Ding J.Gaol F.L.Webb J.","","Institute of Physics Publishing","5th International Conference on Manufacturing, Optimization, Industrial and Material Engineering 2017, MOIME 2017","1 April 2016 through 2 April 2016",,129730,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

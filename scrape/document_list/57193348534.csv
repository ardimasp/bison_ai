The use of spectrum is now considered very minimal and raises the problem of scarcity of spectrum. But after testing the real problem is the spectrum in utilization. This problem can be overcome by using efficient utilization of CR technology using Spectrum Sensing. Sensing algorithms that are usually used such as: a suitable filter, energy detector and cyclostationary are not enough because there are many antennas to be detected. In the case of multi-antenna detection, research usually uses the Generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) approach. The GLRT Approach Detector also has three types of detectors, type-3 detectors do not determine statistical tests. However, if you use monte carlo or the literacy algorithm, you need a lot of data to get the detector performance. this research will combine algorithms using bootstrap to determine detector performance using small data because using Bootstrap basically only requires a small resampling. The research wants to show if a type-3 detector can help the detector produce good probabilities using little data. The expected result is that the GLRT approach can be combined with a bootstrap for type-3 detectors such as: arithmetic and geometric statistical tests (TAGM) and GLRT time code space code statistical tests (TSTBCGLRT) to help determine assumptions Pd assumptions. Then an experiment was carried out to determine the threshold, by comparing bootstrap with monte carlo, research is expected to show that bootstrap works without a known H0 distribution and set the same threshold at all times. ©BEIESP.","Bootstrap; Cognitive Radio; Multi-Antenna",,,,,,"Derek, T., Otermat, I.K., Otero, C.E., Analysis of the fm radio spectrum for secondary licensing of low-power short-range cognitive internet of things devices (2016) IEEE Access, 4, pp. 6681-6691; Rendy, B., Understanding dynamic spectrum access: Models,taxonomy and challenges (2011) IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks, 1st, pp. 649-663; A design method of cognitive overlay links for satellite communications Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 15Th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop (ASMS/SPSC) 2018, pp. 1-6. , 9th; Annamalai, A., Energy detection of unknown deterministic signals in-and-generalized fading channels with diversity receivers (2014) International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC), pp. 761-765. , 1st; Kumar, A., Saumya Dwivedi, A.K.J., Glrt-based spectrum sensing for mimo sc-fdma cognitive radio systems in the presence of synchronization impairments (2016) IEEE Wireless Communications Letters, pp. 280-283; Islam, M.T., Muhammad Sajjad Khan, I.K., Simo-based coarse fine sensing scheme for wideband cognitive radio communication (2015) International Conference on Electrical and Electronic Engineering ICEEE, 26 (3), pp. 205-208; Fajar Nugraha Suhartono Tjondronegoro, F.Y.S., Spectrum sensing of ofdm signals using glrt detector with bootstrap approach (2015) International Conference on Telecommunication Systems Services and Applications (TSSA), 9, pp. 1-6; Suratman, F.Y., Spectrum sensing in cognitive radio: Bootstrap and sequential detection approaches (2014) Dissertation TU Darmstadt; Mohamed, S., Hadj Irid, S.K., A novel algorithm using spatial samplimg and bootstrap to estimate closed space doa for few samples (2017) International Conference on Electrical Engineering-Boumerdes (ICEE-B), pp. 1-5; Kai Feng, L.L., Source detection using bootstrap technique in spatial nonuniform noise (2015) Fourth International Conference on Instrumentation and Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control, pp. 306-310; Luo Meng, H., (2013) Threshold Estimation Method for Spectrum Sensing Using Bootstrap Technique, , Intelligent Computing Theories, Springer, 1st; Mouchini, T., Khalida Ghanem, M.D.A.Z., (2018) Bootstrap Approach for Cognitive Radio, pp. 155-158. , International Conference on Smart Communications in Network Technologies (SaCoNeT); Zeng, Glrt-based spectrum sensing forcognitive radio (2008) IEEE GLOBECOM 2008-2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, pp. 1-5. , 1st; Eigenvalue-based spectrum sensing of orthogonal space-time block coded signals (2014) IEEE Trans Signal, 60 (12)",,,,"Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication",,,,,22773878,,,,"English","Int.

As the technology advances, visual design communication explore further, paving ways to visualize something that doesn't have the visual attribute; sound, something that can only be perceived through auditory senses. The sound is transformed by controlling symbols, images, color movement into an image, using a visual programming software combined with typography composition, to create GIF (Graphic Interchange Format) as the final product. Sound visualization opens the possibility to experience sounds without even hearing it. It is an experimental tool to experience sound, to give an even deeper meaning of a message, and to bridge the possibilities to convey sound to the hearing impairment, those who carry disability, expanding the minds and horizon so they can experience sound. © 2019 IEEE.","disability; GIF; Sound; typography; visualization","Acoustic waves; Arts computing; Computer programming; Flow visualization; Sustainable development; Typesetting; Visual communication; Visualization; Communication process; disability; Hearing impairments; Interchange formats; Sound visualization; Technology advances; typography; Visual communication designs; Audition",,,,,"Weinschenk, S., (2011) 100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know about People, , New Riders 1249 Eighth Street Berkeley, CA; Brody, J.E., Unlocking the world of sound for deaf children (2018) Nytimes.com, 9. , https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/well/live/unlocking-The-worldof-sound-for-deaf-children.html, Oct.

The easy readiness and completeness of information in a drawing determine the quality and timeliness of a project. An incomplete engineering drawing is difficult to read by foreman or craftsman. Building Technology's subject studies the structure and construction of buildings. As a supporting subject, it plays an important role in the creation of design works of the students. Successful mastery of this subject greatly impacts on courage and design exploration of students in Architecture design courses. This study arranged to measure how far the material online can be understood and comparing the teaching's result between the normal method (conventional method) with the multimedia method. As the object of research are students of Building Technology classes LA44, LB44, and LD44 at Bina Nusantara University Jakarta. The method used in this research is experimental research. Preliminary data collection is obtained from each work of the student's assignment. Observation, interview, test through quiz done directly in the classroom and carried out during the odd semester run until the end of the lecture. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","architecture; building technology; multimedia","Architecture; Curricula; Product design; Students; Architecture designs; Building technologies; Construction of buildings; Conventional methods; Engineering drawing; Experimental research; Experimental testing; multimedia; Teaching",,,,,"Van Der Geer, J., Jaj, H., Lupton, R.A., The art of writing a scientific article (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass) (2000) J Sci Commun, 163, pp. 51-59; Kemp, J.E., Dayton, D.K., (1985) Planning and Producing Instructional Media; Badraningsih, L., Students' entrepreneurial behaviour in the implementation of productive entrepreneurship for gastronomy vocational education (2014) Presented on International Conference on VET (ICVET) (Redesign of Vocational Education in Indonesia); Dyrhauge, H., Teaching Qualitative Methods in Social Science: A Problem-based Learning Approach (2014) Journal of Contemporary European Research, 10, pp. 442-455; Smaldino, S.E., Lowther, D.L., Russel, J.D., (2005) Instructional Technology and Media for Learning; Arikunto, (2002) Classroom Action Research; Sudjana, N., (2012) Scoring Teaching and Learning Process","Wizaka, W.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: wwizaka@binus.ac.id",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Advances in the business and entertainment sectors drive the evolution of computer equipment with increasingly sophisticated technology that can make things easier. The development of equipment that supports virtual reality technology is also increasingly modern and realistic, so that the use and the utilization of virtual reality technology can also be widened in various disciplines. Researchers and educators also start competing to explore their potential, develop pedagogical strategies, create teaching materials, and build technology-based and educational infrastructure to find learning systems that are more likely by students and can present high-quality, easy and fun education. In this study, it will be reviewed how the role of Virtual reality technology can help students in understanding the science of building construction. Through combination the use of tools such as VR Gear, 360 cameras and digital computer design, it is expected that various methods that are appropriate, convenient and easy for students. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","architecture; building technology; virtual reality","Architecture; Digital computers; E-learning; Learning systems; Students; Virtual reality; Building technologies; Computer equipments; New teaching; Pedagogical strategies; Science of building; Teaching materials; Technology-based; Virtual reality technology; Engineering education",,,,,"Hilfert, T., König, M., Low-cost virtual reality environment for engineering and construction (2016) Visualization in Engineering, 4 (1), p. 1186; Edwards, G., Li, H., Wang, B., BIM based collaborative and interactive design process using computer game engine for general end-users (2015) Visualization in Engineering, 3; Kihong, K., Pushkar, S.M., Building interactive modeling for construction education in virtual worlds (2011) Journal of Information Technology in Construction (ITcon), 16, pp. 189-208; Kiral, I.A., Comu, S., Kavaklioglu, C., Enhancing the Construction Safety Training by Using Virtual Environment: V-SAFE (2015) 5th International/11th Construction Specialty Conference, Publications Office of the European Union, pp. 1-10; Lyne, D.S., Development of virtual reality applications for the construction industry using the Oculus RiftTM head mounted display (2013) Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Construction Applications of Virtual Reality, pp. 556-563; Piovesan, S.D., Passerino, L.M., Pereira, A.S., Virtual reality as a tool in the education (2012) IADIS International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in Digital Age; Rüppel, U., Schatz, K., Designing a BIM-based serious game for fire safety evacuation simulations (2011) Advanced Engineering Informatics, 25 (4), pp. 600-611","Wizaka, W.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: wwizaka@binus.ac.id",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The easy readiness and completeness of information in a drawing determine the quality and timeliness of a project. An incomplete engineering drawing is difficult to read by foreman or craftsman, and the risk of misunderstanding of the drawing will cost expensive and have potential risk to create many bad implications in the project. Unfortunately, the knowledge and skill of drawing technique are often not completely mastered by most students. On the other hand, according to the regional development situation in architectural and construction issue, the drawing standards must be fully utilized in international standards in order to facilitate cooperative work involving workers and engineers from these region countries. This research will be described some errors that often made by students and of international drafting symbols that supposed to be well used by students and then insert multi-media resources as digital enrichment material that supposed to be used as an additional material. The goal of this study will be to examine how multi-media is employed to positively impact student learning in a Building Technology course. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Architecture student; building technology course; design development drawing; green technology; technical drawing","Architecture; Cost engineering; Curricula; E-learning; Education; Engineering education; Environmental technology; Multimedia systems; Product design; Regional planning; Building technologies; Cooperative works; Design development; Engineering drawing; Green technology; International standards; Regional development; Technical drawing; Students",,,,,"Diamond, R.M., (1989) Designing and Improving Courses and Curricula in Higher Education, , (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass); Barnes, K., Marateo, R.C., Ferris, S.P., Teaching and Learning with the Net Generation (2007) Journal of Online Education; Dale, E., (1969) Audio-Visual Methods in Teaching, p. 108. , 3 (New York: Holt Rinehart and Winston); Douglas, W., (1999) Drafting Symbol Sourcebook, , (New York: McGraw-Hill)","Wizaka, W.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: wwizaka@binus.ac.id","Kasih T.P.","","Institute of Physics Publishing","International Conference on Eco Engineering Development 2017, ICEED 2017","14 November 2017 through 15 November 2017",,133427,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The study conducted in Human Resources Management-Hiring and Assessment. The research method is by using qualitative method, such as interview, observation to company. Data collection was obtained by structured interviews to Senior Manager. Data analysis was analyzed as a single case design, as well as preliminary study. Observation was carried-out to identify the employee in the company on their work, while doing their job by using ERP. The result show, training and assessment is needed in the post-implementation process or ERP implementation to maintain the good ERP system, solved the problem of ERP and find out what the company needs. Human Resource Department is an important part of the company in doing the assessment and recruitment. The conclusions are a proper training is a 'must-do' thing that the company should do. Maintaining the relationship among the employees could give a support by making the environment where employee could interact. Then, employee would give you a suggestion and give more contribution for their work. © 2018 IEEE.","assessment; hiring; Human Resource Management; post-implementation phase; training","Employment; Human resource management; Information management; Natural resources management; Personnel training; Resource allocation; assessment; Data collection; ERP implementation; hiring; Human resources management; Post-implementation; Qualitative method; research methods; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,,"Motiwalla, L., Jeffrey, T., (2012) Enterprise System for Management Second Edition.

Media Social as a media tool in learning process was conducted through this research, as well. Research methodology was conducted by descriptive study, verificative study. Through this research, students in even semester (2, 4, 6, and 8) in some higher-educations were directed as sample. Results reveal that most of students was still reading text-book on off-line-based. They faced network problems when they read e-book on online-based. The results reported that while social media used as for learning process, it should be better if there is a feature added in social media. Generation Z is young people that spend their vacant time by applying the social media, which it means either passivity or time consumption in a freeway. The results showed that textbook off-line based is still their choices in learning process. Most of respondents are Indonesian students as their mother tongue is Bahasa Indonesia. It means that most of them are prefer to use text-book in Bahasa Indonesia. It may limits its usefulness elsewhere. © 2017 IEEE.","e-book; Generation Z; social media; text-book","Electronic publishing; Information management; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Students; Descriptive studies; E-books; Generation Z; Learning process; Network problems; Research methodologies; Social media; Time consumption; Textbooks",,,,,,"Töröcsik, M., Szücs, K., Kehl, D., How generations think: Research on generation Z (2014) Acta Universitatis Sapientiae, Communicatio, 1, pp. 23-45. , 30; http://genhq.com/generational_birth_years/Accessed, 25 June 2017; http://www.bahasaindonesia.net/textbook/Accessed, 25 June 2017; Armstrong, C.J., Edwards, L., Lonsdale, R., Virtually there?

COSO as the internal control measurement in accordance with the principles of administration, in which there are responsibility and control-centered management. In ERP implementation, the primary audience is management because management plays a fairly important role for successful and unsuccessful ERP implementation. GCG is a term used in formulating governance for the company. Basically, corporate governance is rules, principles, or practices that set the direction of the company. This study finds how manufacture industries do strategy implementation to ERP implementation, adherence to COSO, and GCG implementation to get good quality to operational performance that has implication to financial performance as well.","Adherence to COSO; ERP implementation; Financial performance; GCG implementation; Manufacture industries; Operational performance",,,,,,,"Al-Mashari, M., Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems: A research agenda (2002) Industrial Management and Data Systems, 102 (3), pp. 165-170; Alshawi, S., Themistocleus, M., Almadani, R., Integrating diverse ERP systems: A case study (2004) The Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 44 (6), pp. 454-462; Bhimani, A., Risk Management, corporate governance and management accounting: Emerging interdependencies (2009) Management Accounting Research, 20, pp. 2-5; (2011) Internal Control-Integrated Framework, , www.ic.coso.org; (2013) An Overview of COSO's 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework; Djohanputro, B., (2008) Manajemen Keuangan Korporat.

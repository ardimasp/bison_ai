To diagnose this abnormality, the arrhythmia expert or cardiologist uses an electrocardiogram (ECG) by analyzing the pattern. ECG is a heartbeat signal that is produced by a tool called an electrocardiograph sensor that records the electrical impulses produced by the heart. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is often used by researchers to classify ECG signals to Arryhtmia classes. The state-of-the-art research had applied CNN 2D (CNN 2D) with accuracy up to 99% with 128x128 image size obtained by transforming the ECG signal. In this paper, authors try to classify arrhythmia disorder with a different approach by creating simpler image classifier using CNN 2D with a smaller variety of input size that is smaller than state-the-art input and group the classes based on transformed ECG signal from MIT- BIH Arrhythmia database with the purpose to know what the most optimum input and the best accuracy to classify ECG signal image. The result of this research had produced an accuracy of up to 98.91% for 2 Classes, 98.10% for 7 Classes dan 98.45% for 8 Classes. © 2020 Science and Information Organization.","Arrhythmia; CNN; CNN 2D; Convolutional neural network; Ecg; Electrocardiogram; Image classifier",,,,,,"This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research and Technology, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Dasar Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled ""Sistem dan Aplikasi Portabel Pendeteksi Gangguan Irama Jantung Menggunakan Sinyal ECG Berbasis Machine Learning dan Cloud Computing"" or ""Portable ECG-based Heart Arrhythmia Prediction System and Application using Machine Learning and Cloud Computing.""","Humphreys, M., Warlow, C., McGowan, J., ""Arrhythmias and their Management,"" (2013) Nurs.

The shape of a roof is a very influential factor shaping a sense of comfort in the house. Henceforth, everyone will have to sort different forms in choosing the proper roof model that makes them feel comfortable. This research developed a mathematical modeling of the temperature distribution of a room that is influenced by the shape of the roof. This research uses different types of roof to be studied, namely, a rectangular house with a straight, triangular, convex and concave roof. Room temperature distribution is analogous to the concept of thermal fluid dynamics equations. Solution heat equation was solved numerically through explicit finite difference method. However, due to the random observation domain, this study uses ghost-point method. This method uses the quadratic extrapolation approach. The development of mathematical models in the program was compiled using python language, so that the program can represent the temperature of the room at any point well. This research shows that a house which with straight roof is the most efficient in terms of heat distribution.

In Indonesia, we could see there are various types of traditional houses with different roof shapes. For examples, 'Rumah Joglo' from Java, 'Rumah Gadang' from West Sumatra, 'Rumah Tongkonan' from South Celebes, and many more. Analysis of temperature distribution for certain traditional houses with different roof shapes in Indonesia are presented in this paper. It seems interesting to analyzed since the roof of traditional houses apparently adapted in home architecture nowadays. Temperature distribution represented by steady state heat equation and solved by numerical method using finite difference method. Quadratic extrapolation toward ghost point method is also used here to accommodate the arbitrary domain problem. Temperature distributions will simulate some house with different shapes of roof and compare it. In conclusion, this paper will indicate the roof with the most comfortable temperature distribution. © 2018 The Authors.

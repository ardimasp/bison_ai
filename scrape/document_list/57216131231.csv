Transjakarta is the solution of the problem in this metropolitan city. This study aims to measurements of the efficiency Transjakarta corridors based on the level efficiency in each bus station by applying the Data Envelopment Analysis method CCR model and to make recommendation for future improvement. DEA was used because it allowed multiple input and multiple output. In this study the ridership of public transportation is considered as direct output characteristic of efficiency and four indicators are selected as input. From the result, corridor 4 has higher efficiency than corridor 1 and 2 by using the output orientation, all corridors have to improve the performance for increasing the ridership. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","CCR; Data Envelopment Analysis; Efficiency; Output Orientation; Transjakarta Corridors","Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency measurement; Future improvements; Level efficiencies; Metropolitan cities; Multiple input and multiple outputs; Output characteristics; Public transportation; Transjakarta Corridors; Efficiency",,,,"12/AKM/PNT/2019","This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Pengukuran Efisiensi Koridor Bus Transjakarta Terhadap Aktivitas Masyarakat Dengan Metode Data Envilopment Analysis (DEA)” or “Measurement of Transjakarta Bus Corridor Efficiency on Community Activities Using the Data Envilopment Analysis (DEA) Method” with contract number: 12/AKM/PNT/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","(2010) Data Sesus Penduduk Jakarta, , https://sp2010.bps.go.id, BPS Badan Pusat Statistik.

This opportunity is due to the abundant amount of information shared by the user. This fact is especially true for countries with high number of active social media users such as Indonesia. Extraction of information from social media can yield insightful results if done correctly. Recent studies have managed to leverage associations between language and personality and build a personality prediction system based on those associations. The current study attempts to build a personality prediction system based on a Twitter user's information for Bahasa Indonesia, the native language of Indonesia. The personality prediction system is built on Support Vector Machine and XGBoost trained with 329 instances (users). Evaluation results using 10-fold cross validation shows that the system managed to reach highest average accuracy of 76.2310% with Support Vector Machine and 97.9962% with XGBoost. © 2017 PTI.",,"Forecasting; Information systems; Support vector machines; 10-fold cross-validation; Amount of information; Automated analysis; Evaluation results; Extraction of information; Native language; Personality predictions; Status updates; Social networking (online)",,,,"Kementerian Riset, Teknologi dan Pendidikan Tinggi

Traditional personality assessments are done by having individuals participate in personality tests. There are several weaknesses to this approach, namely that it is time consuming, and test participants could have made up their answers. A new approach of personality prediction is explored by merely evaluating the contents of a user's social media account. This paper provides an overview on the development of personality prediction from text on social media, the common issues faced in performing said task, and further improvements that can be applied in the future. © 2017 IIJ.","Linguistic analysis; Natural language processing; Personality prediction; Social media",,,,,,,,"(2016) Merriam-Webster.com, , http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/socialmedia, [Accessed: 16-Sep-2016]; (2015) GlobalWebIndex, , ""GlobalWebIndex Social Report Q1/2015,""; Quan-Haase, A., Young, A.L., Uses and Gratifications of Social Media: A Comparison of Facebook and Instant Messaging (2010) Bull.

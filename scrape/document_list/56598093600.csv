The negative impact that is caused from the waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), has forced many institutions to take some serious action. In the other hand the dependencies toward electronic devices are getting higher, especially in the education area. This paper discusses the E-Waste handling in the area of private higher education institution. Private higher education institution gives significantly contribution to the increasing of the electronic waste. The use of technology has grown rapidly caused by the growth of the student’s intake as well as the need to provide them with the latest technology. However, E-Waste model has been developed and still under reviewed continuously. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT & LLS.

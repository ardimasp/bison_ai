Likewise, there are many definitions to determine the 'ultimate' pile capacity from a load-settlement curve. Although pile load tests have been widely used over the past decades, there are still many questions regarding its practice and interpretation. Frequently asked questions include: when does a pile test considered to have failed? From an economic point of view, a failure in pile loading test can cost quite a lot of money. To what load can the pile be loaded till it is considered to have failed? Can a pile loaded to failure still be used as a working pile? What is a bidirectional pile load test (BD-test)? When should a BD-test be used? Can a pile tested with a BD be used as a working pile? What are the differences between kentledge or reaction piles static loading test with the bidirectional test? Do the different pile tests produce the same results? This paper aims to shed light on these questions, one case history where the pile tested to 'failure' and later used as working piles is presented. © 2020 Southeast Asian Geotechnical Society.

Building any structure above compressible soils without proper consideration can lead to considerable damage and maintenance cost. Geofoam is a type of light-fill material in the lightest category. Since the 1970s, geofoam has been used worldwide to address settlement problems. Unfortunately, geofoam has not received much attention in Indonesia, mainly due to its cost compared to traditional fill. This paper covers the application of geofoam for road construction based on real soil conditions in Indonesia. From the analysis conducted, the use of geofoam reduces the compacted fill required by 40%. This saves not only construction time, but also carbon footprint of the road design. When the reduction of time by using geofoam is considered, geofoam becomes a feasible solution economically as well as environmentally. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon footprint; Highway planning; Roads and streets; Compacted fill; Compressible soil; Construction time; Feasible solution; Fill materials; Maintenance cost; Real soils; Road design; Soils",,,,,,,"Koerner, R.M., (2012) Designing with Geosynthetics; Horvath, J.S., Expanded polystyrene (EPS) geofoam: An introduction to material behavior (1994) Geotextiles and Geomembranes, 13 (4), pp. 263-280; Miki, G., EPS construction method in Japan Proc.

One of the main issues of this technique is it requires a high volume of backfill material to apply the surcharging, hence, whenever the availability of the backfill material is scarce or remote, it becomes expensive. In such a case, vacuum preloading becomes one of the best options to be applied in alleviating the high compressibility and low shear strength of the soft clay layers. This vacuum technique also helps to create a sustainable environment as it omits the needs of a high volume of backfill material. Therefore, no hills cutting or ground excavation is required. This paper presents the difference between surcharging and vacuum preloading methods, the working principle, and installation of vacuum preloading. Case histories in improving the soft soils of in low land areas, a large residential located on high ground about 700m from sea level, and a highway construction projects are presented. The case histories revealed that proper application of vacuum preloading could effectively improve soft clays, be in a low land area or high ground area. The depth improved can reach as deep as 25m. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Negative Pore Water Pressure; Preloading; Surcharging; Vacuum Preloading","Compressibility; Drainage; Highway engineering; Road construction; Sea level; Shear strength; Soils; Pore-water pressures; Pre-fabricated vertical drains; Preloading; Soft ground improvement; Surcharging; Sustainable environment; Vacuum preloading; Vacuum preloading method; Sustainable development",,,,,,,"(2019) Perysaratan Perancangan Geoteknik, p. 136. , SNI 8460; Gouw, T.L., (2018) Vacuum Preloading, Lecture Notes on Soft Soil Engineering; Masse, F., Spaulding, C.A., Pic, W., Varaksin, S., (2011) Vacuum Consolidation: A Review of 12 Years of Successful Development; Gouw, T.L., Liu, Y., Vacuum Preloading for a Power Plant in Southern Vietnam (2013) 18th South East Asian Geotechnical Conf.; Hansbo, S., (1979) Consolidation of Clay by Band Shaped Prefabrication Drains, 5, pp. 16-25; Hansbo, S., Consolidation of Fine-Grained Soils by Pre-fabricated Drains (1981) Proc.

Through this integration, foundation pile can then serve as cooling and heating system, in summer and winter, respectively. During energy pile operation, the pile is subjected to heating and cooling cycles. The thermal cycles induce thermal-induced settlement, and predicting this settlement is a major challenge. As the thermal loading of energy pile is cyclic in nature, constitutive model capable of modelling cyclic hysteresis is necessary. In this paper, a model energy pile embedded in saturated sand and subjected to 5 thermal cycles are back-analyzed using hardening soil with small strain stiffness model. To highlight the importance of modelling cyclic hysteresis, two constitutive models which cannot model the cyclic hysteresis, i.e. hardening soil model and Mohr Coulomb model are used to back analyse the same test. Results show that hardening soil with small strain stiffness model can model the test reasonably well, while hardening soil and Mohr coulomb model severely underestimate the thermal-induced settlement.

Due to the relatively young age of this technology in Asia, not many engineers are familiar with vibrocompaction design techniques. This paper aims to provide design guidelines for practicing engineers on vibrocompaction. The paper covers the vibrocompaction working principles, its different types, its applicability to soil types, as well as its design and execution methods. Two case studies are presented. The first case study was the application of vibroflotation to compact reclaimed sand up to 17 m thick in Batam, an island nearby Singapore. The reclamation process caused the upper 3 m of sand above the seawater level reached dense condition inducing difficulty for the vibroflot to penetrate and densifying the loose sand below it. The solution to overcome this difficulty is discussed in this paper. The second case study was the densification of 12m thick loose silty fine sand in East Borneo to prevent differential settlement of a 44 m diameter oil tank to be constructed on the site. On this site, a problem was encountered during backfilling, the backfill material could not flow out of the probe. The solution to this problem, and other problems encountered during execution of the project are presented. Conclusions and recommendations drawn from the case studies are presented.

The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology has been actively seeking solutions to these two challenges. The first part (geo-energy) of this paper describes a series of novel cyclic heating and cooling centrifuge tests performed on replacement and displacement floating energy piles installed in both saturated sand and clay. The test results reveal that replacement floating energy piles exhibit ratcheting settlement under a constant working load but at a reducing rate when subjected to temperature cycles, irrespective of the type of soil in which they are embedded. On the contrary, displacement floating energy piles exhibit heave behaviour. No existing theoretical model can capture observed ratcheting pile settlement well. This suggests that care must be taken when designing replacement floating energy piles. In the second part (geo-environment) of the paper, a novel three-layer environmentally friendly earthen cover system for climate regions like Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore is investigated through theoretical examination, physical modelling (e.g., one-dimensional soil column and two-dimensional large flume tests), and advanced numerical simulations. This novel cover system consists of a fine-grained soil underneath a conventional two-layer cover with capillary barrier effects. Two-dimensional water infiltration experiments and numerical simulations show that the newly introduced fine-grained soil layer can greatly minimize rainfall infiltration even after a 4-h rainfall event having a return period of 100 years in climate regions. One-dimensional gas emission tests and numerical simulations reveal that a minimum of 0.6 m thick fine grained soil layer compacted at 10% saturation (e.g. those in arid regions) can adequately satisfy the Australian guidelines. No geomembrane is needed. This new environmentally friendly and robust earthen landfill cover system is thus a promising alternative to other landfill covers for minimizing rainfall infiltration and landfill gas emission under all kinds of weather conditions. © 2018 Southeast Asian Geotechnical Society.

This allows foundation pile to exchange heat with the ground, providing a more efficient way to heat/cool the building. Previous studies have indicated that heating can result in an increase of pile capacity due to an increase in horizontal stress as the pile expands when heated. This implies that cooling may result in a decrease of pile capacity as pile contracts. Cooling effects on an energy pile, however, has been overlooked and yet to be investigated. In this paper, centrifuge modelling of a floating energy pile subjected to cooling, before loading it to failure in-flight, in saturated Toyoura sand is presented. The deformation mechanism and performance of the floating energy pile during cooling and mechanical loading to failure are reported and discussed. © 2017 19th ICSMGE Secretariat.

By using the validated finite element model, a parametric study is carried out, considering effects of amplitude of thermal cycles, pile diameter, pile length and relative density of sand. It is revealed that due to volumetric contraction of sand (loose or dense) at the interface under temperature induced cyclic shearing, a reduction of horizontal stress occurs. The degree of reduction in horizontal stress is most affected by the amplitude of thermal cycles and the pile diameter. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Cyclic; Energy piles; Horizontal stress; Sand","Finite element method; Pile driving; Sand; Stress analysis; Thermal cycling; Cyclic; Cyclic thermal loading; Degree of reduction; Energy piles; Horizontal stress; Hypoplastic models; Temperature-induced; Volumetric contraction; Piles; cyclic loading; finite element method; numerical model; pile; sand; stress change",,,,"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, HKUST: FP204

They can provide thermal comfort much more efficiently than traditional air-sourced systems as the ground offers high thermal conductivity and a stable temperature below a certain depth. Energy piles are commonly installed as bored piles (replacement); however, driven (displacement) energy piles are also used in practice. A direct comparison of the performance of these two different types of energy piles subjected to thermal cycles is rarely explored not fully understood. In this study, two centrifuge energy model piles, one wished-in-place at one gravity (i.e. at low stress, simulating bored pile) and the other pile was jacked in at elevated gravity were constructed in saturated Toyoura sand. After construction, they were subjected to five heating and cooling cycles (7–37°C) under a constant working load. Cumulative settlement with a ratcheting pattern was observed for the ‘bored’ energy pile after five thermal cycles. In contrast, a slight heave was recorded for the jacked-in energy pile. The observed heave can be attributed to the densification effect and particle crushing of soil when the pile was jacked in, reducing or even eliminating thermal-induced contraction of sand and hence decreasing the reduction of horizontal stress during thermal cycles. © 2016, Thomas Telford Services Ltd.

Energy piles provide a means for efficiently transferring heat to and from the soil underlying a structure, providing a heat source for heating and a heat sink for cooling of spaces within the structure. Currently the design of energy foundations relies heavily on empirical methods, owing to a limited understanding of coupled cyclic thermo-mechanical effects on pile behavior, particularly long-term performance in clay. Moreover, there is lack of field data since it is expensive and time-consuming to carry out field trials. Based on theoretical derivation, geotechnical centrifuge modelling permits the simulation of heat diffusion phenomena at a rate N2 times (where N is scaling factor) than in prototype. It is thus beneficial to assess long-term behaviour of energy piles by the use of centrifuge modelling technology. In this study, a new heating and cooling system developed for centrifuge modelling at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) is described. The heating and cooling system is comprised of an array of thermoelectric coolers and an electrical-resistance heating coil. Ethylene glycol is used as a heat exchanger fluid to transfer the thermal energy from the heating and cooling system to tubular aluminum model piles via insulated piping with the help of a pneumatic pump. The heating and cooling system is able to control the temperature of the pile over the range from 3°C to 90°C. To assess the long-term serviceability of energy piles in stiff clay, a centrifuge model test was carried out where five cycles of heating and cooling were applied to a single energy pile under a sustained working load at 40g. Test results revealed that a ratcheting settlement pattern was induced after cyclic thermal operation.","Centrifuge modelling; Energy pile; Heating and cooling system; Thermal cycle","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Centrifuges; Cooling; Cooling systems; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Geotechnical engineering; Heating; Soil mechanics; Soils; Structural design; Thermal cycling; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermography (temperature measurement); Centrifuge modelling; Electrical resistance heating; Energy piles; Geotechnical centrifuges; Heating and cooling systems; Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; Theoretical derivations; Thermo-mechanical effects; Piles",,,,,,,"Akrouch, G.A., Sánchez, M., Briaud, J., Thermo-mechanical behavior of energy piles in high plasticity clays (2014) Acta Geotechnica, 9 (3), pp. 1-14; Asaoka, A., Observational procedure of settlement prediction (1978) Soils and Foundations, 18 (4), pp. 87-101; De Moel, M., Bach, P.M., Bouazza, A., Singh, R.M., Sun, J.O., Technological advances and applications of geothermal energy pile foundations and their feasibility in Australia (2010) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 14 (9), pp. 2683-2696; Finnie, I., Randolph, M., Punch-through and liquefaction induced failure of shallow foundations on calcareous sediments (1994) Proceedings of International Conference on Behaviour of Offshore Structures, pp. 217-230. , Boston, MA; Goode, J.C., III, Zhang, M., McCartney, J.S., Centrifuge modelling of energy foundations in sand (2014) ICPMG2014-Physical Modelling in Geotechnics: Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Physical Modelling in Geotechnics 2014 (ICPMG2014), , Perth, Australia, 14 -17 January 2014; Horikoshi, K., (1995) Optimum Design of Piled Raft Foundations, , Ph.D. Thesis.

Despite having been implemented for decades, the design of energy piles still relies heavily on empiricism, as there is limited understanding about heating effects on pile capacity. A series of centrifuge model tests on aluminum energy piles in medium dense saturated sand is reported in this study to investigate heating effects on the settlement patterns as well as capacities of single piles. In total, four in-flight pile load tests under three different temperatures, namely 22, 37, and 52 °C, and different loading sequences were carried out. Variations of pile capacity were interpreted with the help of a nonlinear elastic analysis. The test results show that after heating at zero applied axial load, toe resistance of the pile was mobilized as a result of constrained downward thermal expansion of the pile. Heating to a higher temperature caused the neutral plane to shift towards the pile toe due to a larger degree of mobilization of end-bearing resistance. It is also found that for a pile under a maintained working load, the pile head heaved initially by 1.4%D (D, pile diameter) when the temperature increased by 30 °C, but it gradually settled to 0.8%D after 4 months of continuous heating at the constant temperature. The post-pile settlement is believed to be caused by thermal contraction of sand. Subsequent pile load tests show that pile capacities increased by 13% and 30% with incremental temperatures of 15 and 30 °C, respectively. With an increasing temperature, shaft resistance increased but at a reducing rate. At a higher elevated temperature, toe resistance increased more rapidly than shaft resistance due to a larger downward expansion of the pile. For simplicity, earth pressure coefficients with values of 1.1K0 and 1.3K0 were found to be suitable for estimating the capacities of aluminum model piles with temperature increments of 15 and 30 °C, respectively. © 2014, National Research Council of Canada.

The work is based on the results of a series of thermo-hydro-mechanical finite element analyses, which are compared with centrifuge data, and parametric numerical runs. The analyses prove that an increase in heating loads induces a significant amount of stress and displacement in energy piles, with a remarkable mobilisation of their shaft and end-bearing capacity. Temperature variations up to ΔT = 50 °C induce axial stress up to σth = 716 kPa and pile heave up to dyth = -14.09 mm. These temperature variations mobilise an average side shear resistance and an end-bearing load normalised with respect to those mobilised at failure up to qs, ave/qs, ULT, ave = -14.11% and Qb/Qb, ULT = 27.35%, respectively. The magnitude of these phenomena depends on the significance of the applied temperature variation, the significance of the applied mechanical load to the foundation head prior to thermal loading with respect to the pile axial capacity and the soil response to additional loading/unloading processes. These aspects serve a major role in the evolution of the foundation constraint, which governs the mechanical performance of energy piles when subjected to thermo-mechanical loads. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The cyclic temperature change in piles may induce serviceability problems. At present, the effects of cyclic heating and cooling on the displacement patterns of energy piles are not fully understood. This letter describes a new heating and cooling system developed to control the cyclic temperature in energy piles in a centrifuge. The system is able to control the temperature in an energy pile between 3 and 90uC. Using this system, two tests were carried out to investigate the effects of cyclic heating and cooling between 9 and 38uC on the long-term displacement of an energy pile in lightly overconsolidated (overconsolidation ratio (OCR) 5 1?7) and heavily overconsolidated (OCR 5 4?7) kaolin clay. Under a constant working load, a ratcheting displacement mechanism was observed for both energy piles over five cycles of heating and cooling. The pile in the lightly overconsolidated clay settled continuously but at a reduced rate and the settlement eventually reached 3?8%D (pile diameter). This may be due to a stress reduction caused by plastic contraction of the clay and thermally accelerated creep at the pile–soil interface. In comparison, a relatively smaller settlement of 2?1%D was observed for the pile in heavily overconsolidated clay. © 2014, Thomas Telford Services Ltd.

Compared to the traditional circular pile of the same cross-sectional area, the bearing capacity of an XCC pile is higher due to increased cross-sectional perimeter. Since Geddes solution is based on St. Venant's principle, leading to the results independent of the cross-sectional geometry and size, large differences are induced when estimating the soil stress distribution for XCC pile foundations. This paper derives a modified analytical solution, which is dependent on the cross-sectional geometry of XCC pile, from Geddes solution. Validation of this modified solution was conducted through three-dimensional numerical analysis and proven more suitable for XCC pile foundations. Parametric study on three geometrical parameters is conducted using this modified solution. The results indicate that the stress in founding soil due to skin friction decreases with increasing pile radius and central angle of concave, but increases with increasing length of flat side. The stress due to end-bearing decreases with increasing pile radius and length of flat side, but increases with increasing central angle of concave. From the parametric studies, the recommended dimensions of XCC pile radius, length of flat side, and central angle of concave are recommended ranges from 200 to 600 mm, 30 to 60 mm, and 90° to 150°, respectively. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","End-bearing; Mindlin solution; Modified analytical solution; Skin friction; Soil stress distribution; X-section cast-in-place concrete pile",,,,,,"Acknowledgments The work reported here was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China under Contract No.","U1134207, the 111 Project under No. B13024, and the Foundation of Jiangsu Province under Contract No. CXZZ12-0234.","Boussinesq, J., (1885) Application Des Potentiels: À L'étude De L'équilibre Et Du Mouvement Des Solides élastiques, , Paris: Gauthier-Villard; Chen, Y.M., Liu, H.L., Kong, G.Q., Development and application of X-section cast-in situ concrete pile (2010) Proceedings of 4th Japan-China geotechnical symposium: Recent developments of Geotech, pp. 389-392; Clancy, P., Randolph, M.F., An approximate analysis procedure for piled raft foundations (1993) Int J Numer Anal Meth Geomech, 17, pp. 849-869; Coyle, H.M., Reese, L.C., Load transfer for axially loaded piles in clay (1966) J Soil Mech Fdns Div Am Sot Civ Eng 92(SM2): L-26; D'Appolonia, E., Romualdi, J.P., Load transfer in end-bearing steel H-piles (1963) Proc Am Soc Civ Eng 89(SM2): L-25; (2002) The National Standards compilation group of People′s Republic of China, , GB50007-2002 Code for design of building foundation, China Architecture & Building Pres (in Chinese); Geddes, J.D., The bearing capacity of piles (1953) Thesis, , London, UK: University of Durham; Geddes, J.D., Tables for the calculation of stresses in a semi-infinite medium due to vertical subsurface loading (1966) Geotechnique, 16 (3), pp. 231-255; Hibbitt, K., ABAQUS standard user's manual (2010) Inc, , Pawtucket, RI; Horikoshi, K., Randolph, M.F., Estimation of overall settlement of piled rafts (1999) Soils Found, 39 (2), pp. 59-68; Recommended code of construction technical in Jiangsu Province (2011) Nanjing: Housing and Urban Construction Department of Jiangsu Province, , JG/T 047-2011 Technical specification for cast-in-place X-section pile composite foundation, (in Chinese); Kitiyodom, P., Matsumoto, T., A simplified analysis for piled raft and pile group foundations with batter piles (2002) Int J Numer Anal Meth Geomech, 26, pp. 1349-1369; Liu, H.L., Liu, Z.P., Wang, X.Q., Study on the geometric characteristics of the cast-in-place X-type vibro-pile section (2009) China Railway Sci, 30 (1), pp. 17-23; Luk, V.K., Keer, L.M., Stress analysis for an elastic half space containing an axially-loaded rigid cylindrical rod (1979) Int J Solids Struct, 15, pp. 805-827; Lv, Y.R., Ding, X.M., Liu, H.L., (2011) In-situ tests on cast-in-place concrete X-section pile for bearing capacity of single-pile composite foundation, Geotechnical Special Publication No. 220 ASCE 2011, Changsha, pp. 39-47; Lv, Y.R., Liu, H.L., Ding, X.M., Kong, G.Q., Field tests on bearing characteristics of X-section pile composite foundation (2012) J Perform Constr Facil, 26 (2), pp. 180-189; Meyerhof, G.G., Bearing capacity and settlement of pile foundations (1976) J Geotech Geoenviron Eng, 102 (3), pp. 197-227; Mindlin, R.D., Force at a point in the interior of a semi-infinite solid (1936) Physics, 7, pp. 195-202; Poulos, H.G., Davis, E.H., The settlement behaviour of single axially loaded incompressible piles and piers (1968) Geotechnique, 18, pp. 351-371; Ramiah, B.K., Chickanagappa, L.S., Stress distribution around batter piles (1978) J Geotech Eng Div (ASCE), 104, pp. 229-247; Seed, H.B., Reese, L.C., The action of soft clay along friction piles (2004) Am Soc Civil Eng Trans, 122, pp. 731-764; Selvadurai, A.P.S., Rajapakse, R.K.N.D., On the load transfer from a rigid cylindrical inclusion into an elastic half space (1985) Int J Solids Struct, 21 (12), pp. 1213-1229; Suriyamongkal, S., Karasudhi, P., Lee, S.L., Axially loaded rigid cylindrical body embedded in an elastic half-space (1973) 13th Midwestern mechanics conference, pp. 333-347; Wang, C.D., Pan, E., Stresses due to vertical subsurface loading for an inhomogeneous cross-anisotropic half-space (2004) Int J Numer Anal Meth Geomech, 28, pp. 1233-1255; Wang, C.D., Chen, M.T., Lee, T.C., Surface displacements due to batter piles driven in cross-anisotropic media (2008) Int J Numer Anal Meth Geomech, 32, pp. 121-141","Liu, H.; College of Civil and Transportation Engineering, Hohai University, Nanjing, 210098, China; email: cehliu@hhu.edu.cn",,,"Springer Verlag",,,,,18611125,,,,"English","Acta Geotech.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901241753

Compared to a traditional circular cast-in-place concrete (CCC) pile, an XCC pile of the same cross-sectional area has a larger side resistance due to its larger cross-sectional perimeter. Although the pile capacity and load transfer mechanism of the XCC piled raft have been studied, the influence of this X-shaped geometry on the stress transfer between pile and surrounding soil is still not fully understood. To investigate the effects of the cross-sectional geometry, three-dimensional numerical analyses are conducted on an XCC and a traditional CCC piled rafts using the finite element method. The numerical results are verified by a field test of an XCC piled raft. Computed results reveal that lateral soil arching develops to a distance of approximately twice pile diameter surrounding the XCC pile, which can be demonstrated by the rotation of the principal stresses, leading to a non-uniform effective normal stress across a given cross-section and along the pile depth. The magnitude of the unit side resistance that acts on the concave surfaces of the XCC pile is up to twice the magnitude of the unit side resistance that acts on the flat surfaces. For a given applied load, the total side resistance mobilised on the XCC pile is usually larger than the total side resistance of the CCC pile, by a factor that ranges from 0.5 to 10, depending on the pile depth. Therefore, approximately 66% and 46% of the applied load is carried by the XCC and CCC piles respectively, and simultaneously, approximately 45% and 24% of the applied load is taken by the side resistance of the XCC and CCC piles, respectively. The larger effect of the XCC piled raft contributes to the cross-sectional geometry, which results in a larger perimeter and arching effects. © 2013.","Effective normal stress; Side resistance; Soil arching; Three-dimensional numerical analysis; XCC piled raft foundation","Effective normal stress; Piled raft foundation; Side resistance; Soil arching; Three-dimensional numerical analysis; Cast in place concrete; Geometry; Numerical analysis; Soils; Three dimensional; Transport properties; Piles; foundation; loading; numerical model; pile; soil-structure interaction; stress analysis; three-dimensional modeling",,,,"Government of Jiangsu Province","The authors acknowledge the support of the Special Funds of Central Colleges Basic Scientific Research Operating Expenses under No. U1134207 , the 111 Project under No. B13024, and the support from Jiangsu province No. CXZZ12-0234.",,"Zeevaert, L., (1957) Compensated friction-pile foundation to reduce the settlement of buildings on highly compressible volcanic clay of Mexico City, 2. , Proceedings of 4th international conference on soil mechanics and foundation engineering., London; Davis, E.H., Poulos, H.G., The analysis of piled raft systems (1972) Aust Geomech J, 2, pp. 21-27; Burland, J.B., Broms, B.B., de Mello, V.F.B., (1977) Behaviour of foundations and structures, 2, pp. 495-546. , Proceedings of 9th international conference on soil mechanics and foundation engineering.

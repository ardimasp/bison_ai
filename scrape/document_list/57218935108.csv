In carrying out their work, employees need the motivation to optimize performance. This study aimed to analyze employee's motivation factors in a three-star hotel. The approach used in this study was the qualitative approach in reference to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Çetin's Conceptual Model. Data collection was conducted by interviewing 22 hotel staff members. Interviews were conducted to determine the motivation factors that influenced the performance of the employees and the hotel. A model was designed based on the literature, linking factors of employee motivation with the employees and organizational performance. The results showed that employees were motivated by brand management, hotel vision, the owner, employee component, salary, teamwork, and promotion. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Cetin's Model; Employee motivation; Employee performance; Organizational performance",,,,,,"The authors wish to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika journal team that help publish this article.","Aima, H., Adam, R., Ali, H., Model of employee performance: Competence analysis and motivation (2017) Journal of Research in Business and Management, 4 (11), pp. 49-59; Almatrooshi, B., Singh, S.

There are many problems that can be answered with Machine Learning method, one of them is on educational scope. Many Educators right now cannot identify whether a certain student is on the brink of failing or not. As a result, many college students failed because the educators cannot help them. In this paper, we present our user-friendly decision support tool made from Machine Learning algorithm and to answer the problem we focus, which is to prevent college student from failing by providing educational agents necessary information and predictions. Our objective is to know which machine learning algorithm that can be used to predict the student’s performance and to create a decision support tool that can be used by educational agents so that educational agents can prevent student from failing the course. © BEIESP.","Classifier; Data Training; Dataset; Model",,,,,,"Sommer, D., Sood, B., (2014) Market Share Analysis: Business Intelligence and Analytics Software, , Gartner Research Report; Negash, S., (2003) Business Intelligence.

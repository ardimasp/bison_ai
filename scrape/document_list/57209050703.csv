In order to survive, an SME firm must become ambidextrous, with the capability to manage the paradox in learning, innovation, and transformation in their limited condition, so that they can become more competitive and offer products or services that meet the market demand. To become ambidextrous, a company needs many resources. One way to acquire resources is through alliances. This study models the relationship between alliances formation and firm competitiveness as mediated by organizational ambidexterity using partial-leased squares modelling using data from 137 startups in Indonesia. The results showed that organizational ambidexterity has a full mediation effect in the relationship between alliances formation and firm competitiveness. This study argues that the choice of an appropriate partner that is manifested in the Alliances Formation has the main purpose to enable the start-up company to acquire resources to manage the paradox of management in learning, innovation, and decision for transformation. This ability will make them competitive and can design, produce, and market its products superior to those of its competitors. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

These values and beliefs manifest in their business practices and become critical aspects for the company to attain their goals. In small and medium entrepreneurial business, culture becomes a vital role that drives their success in limited capacity and resources. We estimated our model using the partial least squares method and gathered data from 137 digital entrepreneurial firms within six months using both offline and online methods, using the Hofstede Multi Focus Model as a framework to attribute the practice-culture. The results show that there are three dominant practices reflected in start-ups that have a significant relationship with organizational competitiveness and performance: results-oriented, pragmatic approach to the customer, and professionalism.

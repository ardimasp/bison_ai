Data are obtained from the Badan Pengkajian dan Penerapan Teknologi (BPPT). We implemented two decomposition approach i.e. standard wavelet decomposition and wavelet packet analysis with coif1, coif2, coif3, db2, db3 and haar as the wavelet basis. The level of decomposition on wavelet decomposition begins from 3 to 11, while on wavelet packet analysis starts from the decomposition level 3 to 6. From each subband we extraced the following features: mean, median, skewness, kurtosis, residual energy, energy, standard deviation, and variance. We used k-nearest-neighbor, naive bayes, support vector machine and decision tree as the classifier. The highest accuracy of the wavelet decomposition is 90.41% with db2 as wavelet basis and 11 level of decomposition using support vector machine as the classifier. Wavelet packet analysis approach gives 80.17% accuracy on Haar wavelet basis and 3 level decomposition using decision tree as the classifier. Based on the experimental results, support vector machine and decision tree have better performance than k-nearest-neighbor and Naive Bayes on 77 of total 84 trials. © 2017 Global IT Research Institute - GiRI.","Decision tree; Feature extraction; K-nearest-neighbour; Naive bayes; Support vector machine; Wavelet","Classification (of information); Classifiers; Decision trees; Extraction; Feature extraction; Higher order statistics; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Statistical methods; Support vector machines; Vectors; Wavelet analysis; Decomposition approach; Decomposition level; K-nearest neighbors; K-nearest neighbours; Naive bayes; Optimum feature extraction; Wavelet; Wavelet Packet Analysis; Wavelet decomposition",,,,,"Yani, F., (2012) Peranan Tanaman Padi Sawah Terhadap Perekonomian di Kabupaten Kampar Propinsi Riau; Enhas, A.R., (2015) Perbedaan Indeks Glikemik Beberapa Menu Makanan Berbahan Dasar Nasi. 2014; Statistik, B.P., (2015) Kepadatan Penduduk Menurut Provinsi 2000-2014, , Diakses pada; Mondal, P., Basu, M., Bhadoria, P.B.S., Critical review of precision agriculture technologies and its scope of adoption in India (2011) Am.

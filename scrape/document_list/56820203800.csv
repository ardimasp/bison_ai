Design/methodology/approach: Research data was collected from the executive management of telecommunication technology providers in Indonesia via a questionnaire survey to obtain 150 valid questionnaires for analysis. This study analyzed the overall model fit through confirmatory factor analysis and causal relationships through structural equation modeling. Findings: The results indicate that market orientation mediates the link between balanced APM and strategic agility and that strategic agility mediates the link between market orientation and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The choice of single telecommunication industry in a single country, Indonesia, provides a limitation on external validity. It is, therefore, suggested to extend the research efforts to other industry sectors in multi-country environments. Originality/value: This study extends the knowledge about agile project management by embracing balancing control enforcement and tests it empirically. This study also re-conceptualizes strategic agility to embrace business partner switching capability and market orientation to embrace the inter-partner coordination dimension. Finally, the results highlight that agile project management needs to be framed by market orientation to create higher value for customers. However, market orientation alone is not enough and that the organization requires strategic agility to achieve firm performance. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Balanced agile project management; Firm performance; Firm performance; Market orientation; Strategic agility; Telecommunication",,,,,,"The authors are grateful to the Co-Editors, Assoc.

The merchant must strive to build trust and minimize the consumer's perceived risk. This study analyzes and evaluates the role of trust and perceived risk on a multidimensional perspective. Based on 400 samples collected through a web-survey, this study found that the dimensions of trust and perceived risk have a different role in affecting purchase intention. For example, the time dimension from variable perceived risk has no effect on the trust. However, the time dimension has significant effects on purchase intention. The findings from this study have important and practical implications for e-commerce in developing their strategies, especially in trust building and risk reduction strategy. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt.

Design/methodology/approach: Research data was collected from the executive management of telecommunication technology providers in Indonesia via a questionnaire survey to obtain 150 valid questionnaires for analysis. This study analysed the overall model fit and hypotheses through confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Findings: The results reveal that networking capability has a positive and significant effect on market orientation. However, networking capability does not have a significant direct effect on business process agility. The results also indicate that market orientation does not have a significant direct effect on firm performance but through the mediating role of business process agility. Practical implications: The findings provide a practical foundation for the organisation’s networking capability to be framed by market orientation and business process agility to enhance firm performance. Originality/value: The results indicate that market orientation mediates the relationship between networking capability and business process agility. The findings also reveal that business process agility mediates the relationship between market orientation and firm performance.

In addition, a decrease in sales prices due to competition causes the level of profitability to fall. This condition is thought to be related to problems in collaboration strategies and market attractiveness. So based on this background, this study aims to examine the effect of market attractiveness and collaboration strategies on the business performance of the digital OOH media industry in Indonesia. The type of research used in this study is verification. The unit of analysis and unit of observation in this study is the management of the company's business units which are included in the digital OOH media industry in Indonesia. The research data collected is in the time horizon that is cross-sectional / one shoot. This study uses a multivariate statistics analysis method using PLS.

This emerging technology is extraordinary and has the potential to become a source of growth. The telecommunications industry 4.0 is undergoing transformational development to deal with disruptive technological challenges. Globally, quality has declined from the past few decades, a combination of a stagnant economy and an increase in the quality of income has caused dissatisfaction. Inertia services that are often suffered by large companies are often difficult to shake, customer expectations have also shifted in the market, placing the company in a difficult situation in achieving customer satisfaction, agile and innovative technological trends, cost competition, government policy, and this will increase the level of global competition. Exploration case studies and literature reviews are used to test the antecedents of Service Innovation. The study identifies that disruption of technology services offers opportunities for business development to encourage the use of Internet-based services, increasing demand for cheaper and faster internet for consumers. To facing a competitive advantage, organizations have influenced by Service Innovation with the ability to improve big data analytics and organize future knowledge management capabilities, which are agile and flexible in providing information and solutions. From the managerial perspective, this research provides a comprehensive view of what the impact of Service Innovation is on organizations, how to achieve, what variables contribute, and how to relate with performance. The authenticity of this research lies in the description of how management emerges with a practical oriented framework of how organizations must be formed to be innovative and competitive through the general arrangement of antecedents of service innovation. This study, however, has limitations because the qualitative nature and conceptual framework need to have further investigated through large-scale surveys by quantitative research. © BEIESP.","Big Data Analytics; Competitive Advantage; Disruption Technology; Knowledge Management; Service Innovation",,,,,,,"Fagan, T., Understanding the Services revolution,” 2014.

It is noted that smoothness and appropriateness of IT operation services influence rework of dissemination of information. This research included 65 online stores in West Kalimantan as the sample. Questionnaires with groups of domains of IT processes and Likert scales were used to collect the data. Managers marketing the products through online stores became the respondents. The research aimed to cognize impacts of maturity levels of IT governance on needs of IT operation services. Results indicate that values of maturity levels that are less than 2.51 are dominated by PO Domain (PO1, PO2, PO3, PO4, PO8, and PO9), AI Domain (AI4 and AI5), DS Domain (DS4 and DS5), and ME Domain (ME4). The lowest value (2.421) is at PO3 (determining IT directions). Meanwhile, the highest one (2.975) is at DS6 (identifying and allocating costs). These values of maturity levels become important indicators of perspectives on IT operation services to map structures, processes, and relationships. Management of IT resources through interrelationships of applications, information, infrastructure, and human resources is inevitably necessary. © 2018 IEEE.","IT Governance; IT Operation Services; Maturity Levels;

These values and beliefs manifest in their business practices and become critical aspects for the company to attain their goals. In small and medium entrepreneurial business, culture becomes a vital role that drives their success in limited capacity and resources. We estimated our model using the partial least squares method and gathered data from 137 digital entrepreneurial firms within six months using both offline and online methods, using the Hofstede Multi Focus Model as a framework to attribute the practice-culture. The results show that there are three dominant practices reflected in start-ups that have a significant relationship with organizational competitiveness and performance: results-oriented, pragmatic approach to the customer, and professionalism. This study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of entrepreneurial firm practices from the human resources and organizational perspectives. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Competitiveness; Culture; Customer orientation; Hofstede multi-focus model; Organizational effectiveness; Organizational focus; Performance",,,,,,,"Adizes, I., Organizational passages: Diagnosing and treating life cycle problems of organizations (1979) Organizational Dynamics, 8, pp. 3-25; Afhanorhan, W.H.A.B., Hierarchical component using reflective-formative measurement model in Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) (2014) International Journal of Mathematics and Statistics Invention (IJMSI), 2 (2), pp. 55-71; Bhawsar, P., Chattopadhyay, U., Competitiveness: Review, reflections and directions (2015) Global Business Review, 16 (4), pp. 665-679. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0972150915581115; Blank, S., Dorf, B., (2012) The Startup Owner'S Manual: The Step-by-Step Guide for Building a Great Company, , Pescadero, USA: K & S Ranch; Bös, B., Dauber, D., Springnagel, M., Measuring organizational culture: An empirical assessment of the Hofstede questionnaire in an Austrian setting (2011) IACCM 10th Annual Conference and 3rd CEMS CCM/IACCM Doctoral Workshop, , Ruse, Bulgaria: University of Ruse; Bourantas, D., Papadakis, V., Greek management: Diagnosis and prognosis (1996) International Studies of Management & Organization, 26 (3), pp. 13-32; Brush, C., (2014) Building Culture in A Tech Start-up, , https://www.forbes.com/sites/babson/2014/03/03/building-culture-in-a-tech-start-up/#79a8007c39f3, Retrieved May 17, 2017, from; Burke, M., (2016) Startup Culture: Creating a Company Culture That Rocks!

The purpose of this research is to test the strategic performance measurement system (SPMS) framework through a quantitative approach and to assess the level of importance of variables in the SPMS framework by examining the effect of variables of organizational culture (OCL) on SPMS mediated by activity-based costing system (ABCS) and flexibility strategy (FLS), the effect of OCL on SPMS, the effect of ABCS on organizational performance (OPF), the effect of FLS on OPF and finally the effect of ABCS on OPF. The novelty of this research is to put the ABCS and FLS as mediating variables instead of independent variables as previous researches. The framework is hypothetic-deductive research. Primary data was collected through questionnaires. A number of 150 samples of the 250 questionnaires disseminated to both coal mine companies and mining contractors were collected and processed using SEM Lisrel version 8.7. The sample population was fairly distributed to coal mine organizations as unit of analysis. The results, using SEM Lisrel, OCL as an exogenous variable is positively related to both ABCS and FLS but does not affect SPMS directly. OCL is fully mediated by both ABCS and FLS. ABCS is positively related to both SPMS and OPF. FLS is positively related to SPMS but does not affect OPF directly.

As of today, 383 of Regional Government Water Supply Companies in Indonesia, known as Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum (PDAM), are underperforming with only 36% of urban service coverage or 22,40% of national service coverage in average. This paper aims at examining the effect of the latent variables of strategic entrepreneurship, dynamic capabilities, and government policies to PDAM performance. The novelty of this research is the role of government policy as a moderating variable in the relationship between strategic entrepreneurship and dynamic capabilities as they relate to PDAM performance. The methodology used in this research is the quantitative method conducted through a descriptive and explanatory survey. The number of the sample is 120 respondents. Further data were analyzed using the SEM-PLS method with SmartPLS software. This research proved that dynamic capabilities influence PDAM performance, and indicate the need for a stronger government policy, one that would influence strategic entrepreneurship and dynamic capabilities relate to PDAM performance. These findings are intended to contribute to development of strategic management theory and a managerial implication, specifically that PDAM should apply strategic management for the improvement of their performance in order to actively participate in government programs for drinking water services. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

The internal threat is predominantly the result of poor employee behavior towards organization’s information security policy. If users do not comply with information security policy, security solutions lose their efficacy. The information security policy serves as a tool to provide direction on how to manage and secure all organizational operations including critical assets, infrastructure, people, and process in organizations. A major challenge for organizations is encouraging employees to comply with information security policy. The objective of this paper is to develop a model for investigating the critical factors that influence employee compliance with information security policy based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Some researchers have extended TAM to include additional factors that influence behavior. In order to develop the model, we conducted a literature review and a discussion with the information security experts from the Government and Higher Education Institutions. The factors that affect employee compliance with organization’s information security policy have been identified. Through this study, we find that the TAM can be used to develop a model for investigating employee compliance with Information Security Policy by extended it with organizational and national cultures. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Employee security behavior; Information security policy; National culture; Organizational culture; Technology acceptance model","Personnel; Security of data; Security systems; Conceptual frameworks; Confidential information; Government institutions; Higher education institutions; Information security policies; National cultures; Organizational cultures; Technology acceptance model; National security",,,,,,"Nugraha, Y., (2015) Ian Brown, , An adaptive wideband delphi method to study state cyber-defence requirements, IEEE, Ashwin Sasongko Sastrosubroto; (2014) Indonesia Government Computer Security Incident Response Team, , security incident report; (2014) Best Practices in Email, , Osterman Research, Inc, Web and Social Media Security; Li, H., Zhang, J., Sarathy, R., (2009) Understanding Compliance with Internet Use Policy from the Perspective of Rational Choice Theory, , Decision Support Systems, Elsevier; van Kessel, P., (2008) Moving beyond compliance—ernt and Young Global Information Security Survey; Al-Omari, A., El-Gayar, O., Deokar, A., Security policy compliance: User acceptance perspective.

This insurance market is often characterized by incomplete information on both market sides, which could result moral hazard behavior. The intermediaries’ system attempts to cope this situation and provide efficient information gather from the consumers. At the end, it resulted the insurance portfolio need suitable with their current risk profile. Additionally this system provides the policy contract design and claim settlement flow. The workforces operate the system also require special skills and expert in many different areas, mainly as insurance math and contract law. This requires a scalable provisioning and “de-provisioning” of human workforces, which we argue that the implementation of Human Cloud service could leverage to better position. According to US Census Bureau (2009) Millennials generations are having the highest percentage 25.47% worldwide. Recent research conduct by APJII in 2012 shows that the Millennials Generation occupied 58.4% Internet users in Indonesia. This figure believes would be more significant in recent future years resulted potential workforces. Understanding their perceived values would be important in order to maximize their potential as future workforces. Extended version of TAM is use for this study which enriches by the Perceived Millennials generation values, which we argue could lead to better understanding to this generation cohort.

In the midst of intense competition with vegetable oil producing countries in the world, Indonesia must have international competitiveness which is strongly supported by the technology in order to achieve a sustained competitive advantage. The major purpose of this paper is to examine the direct effect of technological resources to international competitiveness and sustained competitive advantage as well as measure the mediating effect of international competitiveness in the relationship between technological resources and sustained competitive advantage. For these purposes, an empirical survey was conducted with the active participation of 82 palm oil industries in Indonesia. In addition to the survey, in-depth interviews were conducted to follow up the quantitative results. On the basis of path analysis with SmartPLS, technology resources had positive and significant effect to sustained competitive advantage. This study suggests the importance of technological resources in achieving sustained competitive advantage on the part of palm oil industries in developing countries. © IAEME Publication.","Indonesia;

For this major purpose, both dimensions of quantitative and qualitative research were applied including an empirical survey with active participation of 99 private Colleges of Informatics and Computer Management in Indonesia. In addition to the survey, follow up interviews were conducted with the College Heads and Study Program Heads. Results of quantitative data analysis affirm that IT governance had positive and significant mediating effect on the improvement of IT service management. It was also found that the adoption of IT had high positive and significant direct effect on both IT governance and IT governance.

This research is aimed at exploring the effect of consumer confusion towards purchase intention moderated by omni-channel integration. Inspired by the new concept of omni-channel, this study developed a model of consumer confusion to increase purchase intention. Data was collected from a survey of 442 consumers, and SmartPLS was used as a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) tool to analyse data. As a hypothetical development about omni-channel integration as a part of the e-quality service, this study developed three hypotheses. The results of this study showed that e-WOM has a significant impact on (1) consumer confusion, (2) purchase intention mediated by consumer confusion, and (3) purchase intention mediated by consumer confusion and moderated by quality of omni-channel integration quality. The findings of this study differed from those of previous research. The various opinions and information obtained by consumers through e-WOM increased their confusion, and thus made it difficult for them to make purchasing decisions.

The fact shows that none of the 197 schools has obtained accreditation grade A. Moreover, 71.57% of these schools are still accredited with grade C. This condition reveals that there has been no synchronization and interoperability of producing information for the need of processing the academic data. The problem of the research proposal was formulated to (a) produce a new research model regarding influences of IT innovation adoption and IT governance on IT service management in improving information performance of schools; (b) create a hypothetical testing design to cognize influences of every variable in this research. The research aim was to analyze the magnitude of relationships and influences of IT service management based upon supports and deliveries of information services becoming dominant factors improving information performance of schools. The research was designed with an explanatory survey of analyzed units of organizations. Furthermore, the research applied a mixed (quantitative and qualitative) method and concurrent triangulation strategy. Computed quantitative data were obtained from a sample of 55 schools determined through a simple random sampling technique. Strengthening the quantitative analysis, qualitative measurement was conducted through in-depth interviews and FGDs (Focus Group Discussions) with 5 informants in the sample. © 2017 IEEE.","Information Performance;

Previous studies were tested that the omni-channel integration quality can improve customer satisfaction. As a novelty, we introduced omni-channel integration as a moderating variable that influence consumer confusion to the intention of purchase. This paper constituted a hypothetical development about the proposed omni-channel integration as a part of the e-quality service. This proposed research aimed to explore the effect of consumer confusion towards purchase intention moderated by omni-channel integration. In addition, this study discussed about the antecedent of consumer confusion to the intention of purchase, namely e-WOM. Three hypotheses were modeled in this research proposal.

Trust is very important in e-commerce. The nature of online shopping has a greater uncertainty than offline shopping. Seeing as there is an uncertainty that can produce risks, a prospective buyer's trust is needed. A lot of people's unwillingness to shop online is caused by their lack of trust toward e-commerce. E-commerce is said to be one of the ways for SME to compete with bigger companies. However, building trust requires immense time and cost. SME with limited resources may experience difficulties in building trust just with their own resources. Base on literature research that needs to be validated in next research, we found that trust can be built through trust transfer from the reputable and well-known trust-mark issuer, and third party protection such as escrow account service and credit card issuer. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Commerce; Account services; Literature researches; Online shopping; Primary objective; Prospective buyers; Small medium enterprise; Third parties; Trust transfer; Electronic commerce",,,,,,"(2014), Google (Jakarta) Online Shopper Study : IDEA Roundtable; (2013) Trust Marks Report 2013 : ""can i Trust the Trust Mark?"", , The European Consumer Centres'Network; (2015) Profil Pengguna Internet Indonesia 2014, , Asosiasi Penyelenggara Jasa Internet Indonesia and Puskakom UI (Jakarta: Pertama); Li, X., Rong, G., Thatcher, J.B., DO we trust the technology?

Many researchers have studied and proposed models of e-gov adoption in order to predict or explain user behavior, or to formulate a strategy based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Small research number has been established to analyze factors influencing e-gov adoption in military organization. Thus, this work inspects the applicability of the TAM with many constructs under technology-organization-environment framework that predict a suitable model to the Indonesian military in the context of e-gov adoption. The Dematel method was used to figure out the factors that affect the acceptance of e-gov by military personnel using a survey sample of 42 ICT administrators of TNI (Ministry of Defense, Army, Navy, and Air Forces). Moreover, Structural Equation Modelling was used to analyze data of 400 TNI personnel to validate dominant factors resulted from the Dematel. The findings indicate that competitive pressure, self-efficacy of computer, ease of use, e-readiness, usefulness, service quality, attitude, and behavioral intention were valid constructs of e-gov adoption in Indonesian military organization. The study recommends a further research of e-gov adoption strategy that focuses on the implementation of those factors on the level of organizational units within the military. © 2015 IEEE.","e-gov; military;

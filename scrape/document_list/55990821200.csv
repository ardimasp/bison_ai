The system itself is a subsystem of a home security system. The subsystem is one of the essential parts of a home security system that protects its inhabitants, the house itself and the environment around it. It is based on technology that is related to Internet of Things (IOT). The IOT technology being utilized depends on the data communication infrastructure that is running in a house. The infrastructure is built and based on Lora (long Range) technology and in particular Lorawan. The Infrastructure complies with the demand that it is useful and fulfils the requirements of IOT. Lorawan is quite recent but technically comply with the demands for IOT. This research focused on gas leakage detection using a detector. Gas leakage that needs immediate detection is generally used for home use such as LPG. LPG is generally used in house kitchens or sometimes bath rooms. The developed module is for detection and issuance of warning the existence of LPG in its environment. The data for issuance of warning is communicated to a system called Premises Controller. The protection of a house against gas leakage is essential due to its sensitivity to fire sparks. Fire sparks can trigger fire and often explosion. A sensor's sensitivity and the time of early warning determine the effectiveness of mitigating efforts. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Gas Sensor; Internet of Things; Lorawan; Sensor Location","Chemical sensors; Fire protection; Houses; Liquefied petroleum gas; Security systems; Data-communication; Early warning; Gas leakages; Home security systems; Infra-structure; Internet of Things (IOT); Lorawan; Sensor location; Internet of things",,,,,,"Robles, R.J., Kim, T.H., Cook, D., Das, S., A review on security in smart home development (2010) International Journal of Advanced Science and Technology, 15; Rajitha, S., Swapna, T., Security alert system using GSM for gas leakage (2012) International Journal of VLSI and Embedded Systems-IJVES, 3, pp. 173-175; Fraiwan, L., Lweesy, K., Bani-Salma, A., Mani, N., A wireless home safety gas leakage detection system (2011) Proceedings IEEE 1st Middle East Conference on Biomedical Engineering (MECBME), pp. 11-14; Murvay, P.S., Silea, I., A survey on gas leak detection and localization techniques (2012) Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries, 25 (6), pp. 966-973; Technical Data MQ-2 Gas Sensor, , https://www.mouser.com/ds/2/321/605-00008-MQ-2-Datasheet-370464.pdf, Hanwei Electronics (nd); MQ-2 Semiconductor Sensor for Combustible Gas, , https://www.pololu.com/file/0J309/MQ2.pdf, Polulu (nd); Jaladi, A.R., Khithani, K., Pawar, P., Malvi, K., Sahoo, G., Environmental monitoring using wireless sensor networks (WSN) based on IOT (2017) Int.

Plants need to capture photons as energy for photosynthesis in 400nm - 780nm spectrum. Different plant species will respond differently to specific light spectrum. Many studies have been done to find optimal light spectrum for plant growth, but there are still many researches to be done because there are still many combinations of light and plants species to be discovered. Specific light spectra combination is called light recipe. This research will help botanist to discover new light recipe for plant species by mixing 6 light spectra with individual intensity and time control. The developed grow light system has graphical user interface that run in Android tablet, and uses MQTT protocol for communication between android application and grow light system. Light recipe and setting are stored in database and the system also has light sensor to monitor light environmental conditions. Grow light consists of 6 types of 3W high power LED with specific color spectrum: Royal Blue, Deep Red, Ultraviolet, Full Spectrum, Far Red, and Natural White. Testing result shows that the system can produce uniform light distribution across the 50 x 50 cm grow area on average 22.6 μmol m-2s-1 using 60° lens. Germination result of lettuce using grow light shows good results compared to sunlight. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Artificial grow light; LED; MQTT; PAR","Android (operating system); Cultivation; Graphical user interfaces; Light emitting diodes; Android applications; Design and implementations; Environmental conditions; High power LED; Leafy vegetables; Light distribution; MQTT; Vegetative growth; Light",,,,"Binus University: 109/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019, 23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019, 038/VR","This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia, as a part of National Competitive Research Grant to Binus University titled “Integrated Hydroponic Automation System Design using Real Time OS based on ARM Cortex-M Microcontroller” with contract number: 109/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019, 23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019, 038/VR.RTT/IV/2019.","Kozai, T., Fujiwara, K., Runkle, E.S., (2016) LED Lighting for Urban Agriculture; Darkó, É., Heydarizadeh, P., Schoefs, B., Sabzalian, M., Photosynthesis under artificial light: The shift in primary and secondary metabolism (2014) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series B, Biological Sciences, 369; Snowden, M., Cope, K., Bugbee, B., Sensitivity of Seven Diverse Species to Blue and Green Light: Interactions with Photon Flux (2016) PLOS ONE, 11; Bantis, F., Ouzounis, T., Radoglou, K., Artificial LED lighting enhances growth characteristics and total phenolic content of Ocimum basilicum, but variably affects transplant success (2016) Scientia Horticulturae, 198; Byun, A., Mao, M., Sidhu, R., The Effect of Different Wavelenghts on the Germination time of Arabidopis thaliana wild type and mutant type seeds (2013) The Expedition, 3; Demotes, S., Péron, T., Corot, A., Bertheloot, J., Gourrierec, J., Travier, S., Crespel, L., Sakr, S., Plant responses to red and far-red lights, applications in horticulture (2015) Environmental and Experimental Botany, 309; Deram, P., Lefsrud, M., Orsat, V., Supplemental Lighting Orientation and Red-to-blue Ratio of Light-emitting Diodes for Greenhouse Tomato Production (2014) HortScience, 49; Hernández, R., Kubota, C., Tomato seedling growth and morphological responses to supplemental LED lighting red: Blue ratios under varied daily solar light integrals (2012) Acta Horticulturae, 956; Huché, L., Crespel, L., Gourrierecb, J., Morela, P., Light signaling and plant responses to blue and UV radiations - Perspectives for applications in horticulture (2016) Environmental and Experimental Botany, 121, pp. 22-28; Kopsell, D., Sams, C., Morrow, R., Blue Wavelengths from LED Lighting Increase Nutritionally Important Metabolites in Specialty Crops (2015) HortScience, 50","Atmadja, W.; Computer Engineering Department, Jl.

IOT applications for Home Security and Smart Home applications are of interest. Both applications are sensor rich and those sensors face the problem of transmitting data related to their task. Hence, this research concern providing solution of data transmission infrastructure within the house and ultimately to a centralized control and monitoring site. Infrastructure is important as each sensor has its specific task and generally made by different vendors. The infrastructure selection methods is based on the logic that wireless infrastructure is preferred to avoid costly installation and aesthetics reasons. Energy consumption for green compliance is another consideration. Sensors that are IOT ready are low power for green compliance. IOT ready sensors have intelligence embedded to it and could receive and transmit data according to its needs. In this research Lorawan is selected as the solution of providing the wireless infrastructure within a house due to its readiness for IOT and fulfil other requirements as well. The behaviour of Lorawan in terms of data transmission reliability and coverage is measured. Experiments are conducted for determining transmission coverage.

Hydroponics has become a reality for greenhouse growers in virtually all climates. Large hydroponic installations exist throughout the world for growing flowers, vegetables and some short period fruit like tomato and cucumber. In soilless culture, we must maintain stable pH and conductivity level of nutrient solution to make plant grow well, large variation of pH of certain time will poisoned plant. This paper describes development complete automation hydroponic system, from maintaining stable nutrient composition (conductivity and pH), grow light, and monitor plant environment such as CO2, temperature and humidity. The heart of our automation is ARM Cortex-M4 from ST Microelectronic running ARM mbed OS, the official Real Time Operating System (RTOS) for ARM Cortex-M microcontroller. Using RTOS gives us flexibility to have multithreaded process. Results show that system capable to control desired concentration level with variation of less than 3%, pH sensor show good accuracy 5.83% from pH value 3.23-10. Growing light intensity measurement show result 105 μmol/m2/s therefore we need turn on the light at least 17 hours/day to fulfil plant light requirement. RTOS give good performance with latency and jitter less than 15 us, system overall show good performance and accuracy for automating hydroponic plant in vegetative phase of growth. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","ARM Cortex-M; growing light; Hydroponic; mbed OS; nutrient solution; RTOS","Computer operating systems; Microcontrollers; Microelectronics; Nutrients; pH; pH sensors; Arm cortices; Hydroponic; Light-intensity measurement; Nutrient solution; Nutrient-rich solutions; Real time operating system; RTOS; Temperature and humidities; ARM processors",,,,,,"Ahmad, R., Ahad, K., Iqbal, R., Muhammad, A., Acute Poisoning Due to Commercial Pesticides in Multan (2002) Pakistan Journal of Medcal Sciences, 18, pp. 227-231; Roberto, K., (2003) How-To Hydroponic, , 4 (Futuregarden); Sahare, V., Jain, P., Automated Hydroponic System using Psoc4 Prottyping Kit to Deliver Nutrients Solution Directly to Roots of Plants on Time Basis (2015) International Journal of Advanced Research in Electrical, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, 4, pp. 8765-8770; Mishra, R.I., Jain, P., Design and Implementation of Automatic Hydroponics System using ARM Processor (2015) International Journal of Advanced Research in Electrical, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, 4 (8), pp. 6935-6940; Umamaheswari, S., Preethi, A., Pravin, E., Dhanusha, R., Integrating Scheduled Hydroponic System IEEE International Conference on Advances in Computer Applications (ICACA), , (Coimbatore, India, 2016); Torres, A., Lopez, R.F., (2012) Measuring Daily Light Integral in A Greenhouse, , (Purdue); Olle, M., Viršile, A., The effect of light-emitting diode lighting on greenhouse plant growth and quality (2013) Agricultural and Food Science, 22, pp. 223-234; Massa, G.D., Kim, H.-H., Wheeler, R.M., Mitchell, C.A., Plant Productivity in Response to LED Ligthing (2008) HortScience, 43, pp. 1951-1956; Philips, (2014) Philips Ligth Recipes in Horticulture, , (Philips); (2017) Open Agriculture Initative (OpenAg), , https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/open-agriculture-openag/overview/, MIT Media Lab, [Online]; Li, Q., Yao, C., (2003) Real-Time Concepts for Embedded Systems, , R.-T.

Surabaya in East Java has several amusement parks that cater for low budgets and they have good-quality equipment and are safe to use. The purpose of this research is to show the results of building a low-cost amusement park. The amusement park was built by a player in the amusement park industry in collaboration with the Computer Engineering Department of Bina Nusantara University. An infinity mirror room (IMR) was built in one of the new amusement parks in Surabaya called Suroboyo Night Carnival. The full design of the IMR is discussed in this paper including the equipment used in the design. The IMR mainly uses fibre optics, LED and a mirror. The amusement park began operation on July 28, 2013, and the amount spent on one room was around US$8,500. No safety breaches have been reported. The facility has been able to attract 500 visitors on average from 2013 to 2016.

In doing so, license plates attached, especially, on cars will be the test subject of this research. The ANPR is already implemented within the barrier gate parking system. It is able to record the data of the vehicles that come in yet it doesn't necessarily recognize or identify the license plates installed on the vehicles. The fundamental goal of the ANPR program itself is actually to utilize digital image identification system in order to identify every single vehicle that goes in and out through the barrier gate parking system. From the result of the experimentation, the ANPR is able to detect and translate the license plates into a form of text in less than one second with 100% accuracy for high quality image, 82.6% for medium quality and 44.5% for low quality image.

Building an efficient mass transportation system is clearly necessary. However, implementing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have also been demonstrated effective in various advanced countries. Recently, the floating vehicle technique (FVT), an ITS implementation, has become cost effective to provide real-time traffic information with proliferation of the smartphones. Although many publications have discussed various issues related to the technique, none of them elaborates the discrepancy of a single floating car data (FCD) and the associated fleet data. This work addresses the issue based on an analysis of Sugiyama et al's experimental data.

The result showed that the accuracy is 95% compared to the commercial seismograph measurement. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Accelerometer; AVR; Earthquake; GSM; Microcontroller; Seismic intensity meter",,,,,,,"Indonesia: A Necklace of Equatorial Emeralds, , http://www.indo.com/indonesia/archipelago.html, Anonymous, retrieved on May 1st 2012, from Bali; Subarya, C., Chlieh, M., Prawirodirdjo, L., Avouac, J.P., Bock, Y., Sieh, K., Meltzner, A.J., McCaffrey, R., Plate-boundary deformation associated with the great sumatera-andaman earthquake (2006) Nature, 440, pp. 46-51; Sekizawa, A., Simultaneous Post-earthquake Fires and the Role of Firefighting Activiy for Mitigating the Damage, , http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Xh2bvFZv8EoJ: management.kochitech.ac.jp/PDF/IWPM/IWPM_Sekizawa.pdf+&hl=en, retrieved on 10th August 2012, from; Gibson, G., An introduction to seismology (1997) Disaster Prevention and Management, 6 (5), pp. 356-361; Evans, J.R., The Sidebar Computer Program: A Seismic-Shaking Intensity Meter, , http://geopubs.wr.usgs.gov/open-file/of03-202/, retrieved on 10th August 2012, from U.S. Geological Survey, Open-File Report 03-202; Hosokawa, M., Byeong-Pyo, J., Takizawa, O., Earthquake intensity estimation and damage detection using remote sensing data for global rescue operations (2009) Proceeding of IEEE International Geosciences and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2, pp. II420-II423; Lele, M.A., Gu, J., Evaluation of solid state accelerometer sensor for effective position estimation (2011) Proceeding of 9th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation (WCICA), pp. 959-964; Takahashi, H., Asakawa, E., Kawai, Y., Ogasawara, Y., Saeki, T., Study on accelerometers in reflection seismic surveys (2007) Proceeding of Symposium on Underwater Technology and Workshop on Scientific Use of Submarine Cables and Related Technologies, pp. 420-426; Yongzheng, Z., Yingsha, X., The design and implementation of embedded system (2011) Proceeding of 3rd International Conference on Computer Research and Development (ICCRD), 2, pp. 423-426; TDL-303/303C/303S/303CS Digital Portable Seismographs, , http://www.taide.com/old/productHTM/TDL.htm, Anonymous, retrieved on March 30th 2011, from TDL series Digital Portable Seismographs(TDL-203/303/303C/303S/303CS/303Q Types); Algermissen, S.T., Steinbrugge, K.V., Seismic hazard and risk assessment: Some case study (1984) Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance, 9 (1), pp. 8-26; Gupta, H.K., Rao, N.P., Rastogi, B.K., Sarkar, D., The deadliest intraplate earthquake (2001) Science, 291 (5511), pp. 2101-2102; Li, L.T., Min, W.Y., Magnitude estimation using the covered areas of strong ground motion in earthquake early warning (2010) Geophysical Research Letters, 37 (9), pp. L09301-L09305; Porro, B., Natural disaster insurance, problems of capacity and solvency (1984) Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance, 9 (2), pp. 158-166; King, S.A., Kiremidjian, A.S., (1996) Shake, Rattle and Map, Civil Engineering, 66 (6), pp. 50-52","Sutanto, A.T.; Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysic, Jl Angkasa 1No. 2 Central, Jakarta, Indonesia; email: steff@binus.edu",,,,"2012 International Conference on Advances Science and Contemporary Engineering, ICASCE 2012","24 October 2012 through 25 October 2012","Jakarta",,18777058,,,,"English","Procedia Eng.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891765945

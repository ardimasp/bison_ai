Many countries already implemented Green IT initiatives to reduce carbon emissions. Studied about the level of awareness of Green IT has been done in many countries, except Indonesia. Indonesia has committed to reduce carbon emission by 26% in 2020 and Green IT is one of the potential ways to be implemented to achieve the goal. This proposed paper is going to use survey that has been done previously by RMIT University and Info~Tech to get the level of awareness of Green IT among IT professionals in Indonesia. The results then will be compared to other countries and to highlight the opportunities to increase the awareness level in Indonesia. Following study will be under taken to assess the Green IT readiness index of companies in Indonesia as per Green IT framework developed by previous researchers.","Awareness; Carbon emissions; CO2; Environmental footprint; Green IT; Readiness","Information management; Awareness; Carbon emissions; CO2; Environmental footprints; Green IT; Readiness; Knowledge management",,,,,"Addressing the challenge of energy efficiency through Information and Communication Technologies (2008), http://www.euractiv.com/en/infosociety/brussels-launch-new-green-ict-plan/article-178747, Commission of the European Communities, EurActiv.

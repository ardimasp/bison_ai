This paper is intended to solve the problem in one company which serves more than sixteen professional companies in South East Asia area. This report is useful to make decisions in this company. The method chosen to develop the data warehouse along with its analytics and reports is Kimball methodology which has been introduced since the mid-1980s and has been used by a lot of prior researchers. As the data can be displayed in various form as it needed, the stakeholder can make the data-driven decision which benefits this company to perform better in the market. © 2017 IEEE.","Data warehouse; kimball; physical examination; report","Engineering; Data driven decision; kimball; Physical examinations; report; Reporting systems; Southeast Asia; Data warehouses",,,,,"Dedic, N., Stanier, C., An Evaluation of the Challenges of Multilingualism in Data Warehouse Development (2016) International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems - ICEIS, 18; Snijders, C., Matzat, U., Reips, U.-D., ""big Data"": Big Gaps of Knowledge in the Field of Internet Science (2017) International Journal of Internet Science, pp. 1-5; Marz, N., Warren, J., Big Data: Principles and best practices of scalable realtime data systems (2015) Manning; Kamki, J., (2017) Digital Analytics: Data-Driven Decision Making in Digital World, , Notion Press; Murphy, S.N., Avillach, P., Bellazi, R., Phillips, L., Gabetta, M., Eran, A., McDuffie, M.T., Kohane, I.S., Combining clinical and geonomics queris using i2b2-Three methods (2017) PloS One; Abelló, A., Romero, O., Pedersen, T.B., Berlanga, R., Nebot, V., Aramburu, M.J., Simitsis, A., Using semantic web technologies for exploratory OLAP: A survey (2015) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 27 (2), pp. 571-588; Kimball, R., Ross, M., (2016) The Kimball Group Reader: Relentlessly Practical Tools for Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence Remastered Collection, , 2ed.

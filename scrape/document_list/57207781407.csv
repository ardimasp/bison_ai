Low Powered Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is used as a communication network. LoRa devices are configured with a frequency of 470 MHz, spread factor 9, bandwidth of 31.25 KHz, and code rate of 4/5. The study found that the UM402 LoRa module has the farthest network range, up to 1 Km. By focusing on a range of up to 250 m, the LoRa Dragino shield has the fastest data packet delivery time at 0.77 s. UM402 LoRa module has the largest Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) value at 50m, it is -34. All LoRa devices used in this research can operate well at the ideal distance of street lights (35 m). © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

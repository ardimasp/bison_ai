The traditional waterfall methodology is commonly known with its limitations with its inflexible and non-user-centric approach. Thus, to overcome waterfall limitation, other methodology can be performed in system development. Scrum methodology is said to be a new breakthrough to overcome classic waterfall methodology limitations. In order to overcome waterfall limitations, Scrum methodology can be combined with IBM Design Thinking to provide the best result as both concept build on user-centric concept. This research will be discussing how to combine and the advantages of combination of Scrum and IBM Design Thinking in order to overcome the Waterfall's limitations. This research will cover system development with scrum methodologies that will be combined with IBM Design Thinking concept and tools in related Dashboard and Report System development. This paper will not cover the old waterfall detailed process and will only discussed it's limitations. Scrum and IBM Design Thinking both are user-centric frameworks that can be used by system developers to help them to have a better understanding of their user. This research shows that scrum that complimented with IBM Design Thinking delivers better results than Waterfall methodologies. Both Scrum and IBM Design Thinking overcame the Waterfall's methodology limitation which leads to better result for all team involved. © 2020 Little Lion Scientific.

One of the most common methodology used now is Scrum. The Scrum methodology is known for developing more dynamic, adaptive and flexible systems. This methodology can be combined with the IBM Design Thinking framework in order to bring more understanding of user needs and offering more system value for users. The purpose of this research is to find out how combination of Scrum methodology and IBM Design Thinking can provide a better value for user in a system development. In order to combine these two methods, this research using common Scrum Methodologies and IBM Design Thinking from IBM. This research will combine Scrum and IBM Design Thinking and its deliverables to provide the best value for users. This case study shows that the combination of Scrum and IBM Design Thinking helped the development team in understanding user needs so that results are more effective and accepted by users. As both Scrum and IBM Design Thinking are sharing user-centric values, this study found that Scrum and IBM Design Thinking both complimenting each other in order to produce and provide the best value for users. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

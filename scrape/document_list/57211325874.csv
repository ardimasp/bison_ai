However, its presence has not been evenly distributed for the central and regional governments. This is because civil servants in parts of Indonesia have not had any insight into the functions and roles of information technology. This research aimed at empirically provides comprehension to the civil servants in Central Mamberamo Regency, one of the remote areas in Indonesia, through a theoretical framework on the use of e-government. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) was modified to determine the factors that influence the behavior of civil servants to use e-government technology. Surveys were conducted to collect research data by distributing a set of questionnaires to civil servants. Respondents’ answers were collected and statistically analyzed using the multiple linear regression method. The results of the analysis showed that factors of performance expectancy, usage effort expectancy, the influence of heads and coworkers, regional government facilities conditions, and the job-fit were to have a powerful influence on the behavior of civil servants to use e-government technology at 72.2%. © 2019 IJSTR.","Civil servants; E-government; Regional government; Statistical analysis; Utaut model",,,,,,"Anneke Zuiderwijk, A.M.J.A.Y.K.D.B., Acceptance and use predictors of open data technologies: Drawing upon the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (2015) Government Information Quarterly, pp. 1-12; Yakup, A., Adoption of e-government services in Turkey (2017) Computers in Human Behavior, pp. 1-11; Jurisch, M.K.P.W.H.K.M.C., (2015) An International Survey of the Factors Influencing the Intention to use Open Government, , in 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, Germany; Alrawabdeh, W., E-Government Diffusion in Jordan: Employees’ Perceptions Toward Electronic Government in Jordan (2017) American Journal of Applied Sciences, pp. 1-10; Mijail Naranjo Zolotov, A.T.O.A.S.C.B., E- participation adoption models research in the last 17 years: A weight and meta-analytical review (2018) Computers in Human Behavior, pp. 1-16; Manuel Rey-Morenoa, J.A.F.C.M.-M.R.R., Facilitator and inhibitor factors: Adopting e- government in a dual model (2017) Journal of Business Research, pp. 1-8; Lingling Gao, K.A.W.X.B., Understanding consumers’ continuance intention towards mobile (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, pp. 1-14; Faizura Haneema, N.K.N.T.D.P.N.A.A.B., Determinants of master data management adoption by local government organizations: An empirical study (2018) International Journal of Information Management, pp. 1-19; Robert Howard, L.R.C.-Y.C., Addressing individual perceptions: An application of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology to building information modeling (2017) International Journal of Project Management, 35, pp. 107-120 and 1-14. , 2017; Kate Magsamen-Conrad, A.S.U.B.C.Y.J.B.J.D., Bridging the divide: Using UTAUT to predict multigenerational tablet adoption practices (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, pp. 1-11; Rik Peeters, A.W., The digital cage: Administrative exclusion through information architecture (2018) Government Information Quarterly, pp. 1-9; Md Mahmudur Rahman, M.F.L.W.J.H.L.S., Assessing the utility of TAM, TPB, and UTAUT for advanced driver assistance systems (2017) Accident Analysis and Prevention, pp. 1-13; Zeyu Penga, Y.S.X.G., Antecedents of employees’ extended use of enterprise systems: An integrative view of the person, environment, and technology (2018) International Journal of Information Management, pp. 1-17; Sangki, J., Vision of future e-government via new e- government maturity model: Based on Korea’s e- government practices (2017) Telecommunications Policy, pp. 1-12; Saliza Abdul Aziz, K.M.I., (2014) Does design matter in tax e-filing acceptance?, , in International Conference on Accounting Studies 2014, ICAS 2014, 18-19 August 2014, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Malaysia; Bostjan Sumak, A.A.S.A.B., The acceptance and use of interactive whiteboards among teachers: Differences in UTAUT determinants between pre- and post- adopters (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, pp. 1-19; Attuquayefio, S.N., Using the UTAUT model to analyze students’ ICT adoption (2014) International Journal of Education and Development using Information and Communication Technology (IJEDICT), pp. 1-12; Jean Damascene Twizeyimanaa, A.A., The public value of E-Government - A literature review (2019) Government Information Quarterly, pp. 1-12; Chaumon, M.-E.B., L’acceptation située des technologies dans et parl’activité: Premiers étayages pour une clinique del’usage (2016) Psychologie du travail et des organisations, pp. 1-18; Carlos Tam, T.O., Understanding the impact of m- banking on individual performance: DeLone & McLean and TTF perspective (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, pp. 1-12; Di Wanga, C.C.D.R., A prioritization-based analysis of local open government data portals: A case study of Chinese province-level governments (2018) Government Information Quarterly, pp. 1-13",,,,"International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research",,,,,22778616,,,,"English","Int.

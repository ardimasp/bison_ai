Along with the times, an innovation is needed in the learning process. E-learning is a learning method that uses electronic media as teaching material for students. At XYZ University, the use of e-learning is also applied in their learning system. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of student study habits on the effectiveness of e-learning. The data were taken from 157 online student respondents XYZ University who were taking a master program and then analyzed using the smartPLS tool. It is known that the influential variables are Delay Avoidance, Work Method, Self-Efficacy, and Self-Directed Learning. The results of this study indicate that the Work Method and Self-Directed Learning factors have a positive and significant effect on the effectiveness of e-learning and can be considered to increase the effectiveness of the e-learning learning system. © 2020 Little Lion Scientific.

Likewise with a service system, the hospital should try to provide the best service facilities. This research presents a framework of gamification that is applied to the game elements integration. With this gamified system patients are expected to be able to play games while waiting for their examination turn without feeling boring. Another expectation of using the gamified system is to see the loyalty of patients who frequently visit the hospital.

The performance of SMC is compared with PID which PID parameter is tuned using GRG nonlinear that had been presented in other paper. The RCWS model is defined as a 2 revolute joints serial manipulator hence its system is MIMO. Modelling the motion using Denavit-Harternberg (DH) Parameter for kinematic modelling and Langrangian formula for dynamic modelling. Since the output of Lagrangian formula is a nonlinear equation, the RCWS is a nonlinear system. The model is simplified using state space model to presents its complexity of MIMO system and nonlinear system. State Space model and controller (PID and SMC) is simulated in Simulink. SMC usually used for MIMO and nonlinear system. SMC also known as a robust controller. SMC is unique controllers that has to define its sliding surface so respons could slide on it. Compared with PID, SMC make a better performance. SMC just need 0.8 sec for azimuth movement and 0.6 sec for elevation movement to be settled, its only make 3.65% overshoot for azimuth movement and 0.1% overshoot for elevation movement, then only produce 0.003rad for Root Mean Square Steady State Error at most for both movement. © 2017 IEEE.","MIMO System; Nonlinear System; RCWS; Sliding Mode Control; State Space","Intelligent mechatronics; Manipulators; Manufacture; MIMO systems; Nonlinear equations; Nonlinear systems; Remote control; Sliding mode control; State space methods; Kinematic modelling; RCWS; Remote control weapon stations (RCWS); Remote-control weapon stations; Serial manipulators; Sliding mode control(SMC); State - space models; Steady state errors; Controllers",,,,,"AbuQassem, M.R., (2010) Simulation Interfacing of 5 Dof Educational Robot Arm, , Thesis: Electrical Engineering Department, Islamic University of Gaza; Fu, K.S., Gonzales, R.C., Dan Lee, C.S.G., (1987) Robotics: Control, Sensing, Vision, and Intelligent, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Holkar, K.S., Sliding mode control with predictive pid sliding surface for improved performance (2013) International Journal of Computer Application, 78 (4); Liu, J., Dan Wang, X., (2012) Advanced Sliding Mode Control for Mechanical Systems, , Tsinghua University Press, Beijing and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg; Nasir, A.N.K., Ismail, R.M.T., Raja Dan Ahmad, M.A., Performance comparison between sliding mode control (SMC) and pd-pid controllers for a nonlinear inverted pendulum system (2010) International Journal of Computer, Electricalm Automation, Control and Information Engineering, 4 (10); Nise, N.S., (2011) Control System Engineering Sixth Edition, , John Wiley & Sons, Inc, Jefferson City; Ogata, K., (2010) Modern Control Engineering, , New Jersey: Prentice Hall; Slotine, J.E., Dan Li, W., (1991) Applied Nonlinear Control, , New Jersey: Prentice Hall; Tsai, L.-W., (1999) Robot Analyis the Mechanical of Serial and Parallel Manipulators, , John Wiley & Sons, Inc, Canada; Mehran, R., Ahmad, G., Ettafagh Mohammad, D., Robust adaptive control of a bio-inspired robor manipulator using bat algorithm (2016) Expert Systems with Applications, 56, pp. 164-176","Pramujati, B.; Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Indonesia; email: pramujati@me.its.ac.id",,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2017 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronics, Intelligent Manufacture, and Industrial Automation, ICAMIMIA 2017","12 October 2017 through 14 October 2017",,137263,,9781538627297,,,"English","Proceeding - ICAMIMIA : Int.

A Reformulated inversionless-Berlekamp- Massey algorithm is adopted in order to eliminate the finite-field inverter and to reduce the hardware complexity. Furthermore, we proposed a Direct reformulated-inversionless Berlekamp-Massey algorithm (DriBM). While in the Chien Search stage, the Constant-Factor Multiplication-Free Matrix transform is also introduced to avoid expensiveness which significantly reduce the area and critical path. Moreover, we also developed Extended Fast Chien Search algorithm which significantly reduce computation complexity and the area by nearly 33% compared to Constant-Factor MFTM. Using our proposed design, we design a BCH(15,7) decoder which can reach speed up to 2.2 GHz with total area of is 8170μm2 using 0.18μm CMOS standard cell technology. The merits of the proposed algorithms and architecture are very efficient and fast. The implementation of the proposed BCH decoder architecture is also scalable to higher n block lengths and t number of correctable error, by using the same concept as we design BCH(63,51) using the same concept as BCH(15,7). In addition to the parallel BCH Decoder, we also design an area efficient parallel GF multiplier and squarer which minimized the number of logic gates. This design has been implemented and verified on Altera DE2 FPGA using codeword with various error positions and weight (0-2 guaranteed error correction). Due to its low complexity, it is suitable for VLSI implementation and also provide excellent tradeoffs between the correcting capacity, speed and area penalties. © 2010 IEEE.","BCH decoder; Ultra-fast-scalable-efficient; VLSI architecture","Area efficient; Area penalty; BCH decoder; Berlekamp-Massey algorithm; Block lengths; Chien search; CMOS standard cell technology; Codeword; Computation complexity; Correcting capacity; Critical Paths; Decoder architecture; GF multiplier; Hardware complexity; Low complexity; Matrix transforms; Speed-ups; Ultra-fast; VLSI architectures; VLSI implementation; Algorithms; Computer science; Design; Electric batteries; Information technology; Integrated circuit testing; Multiprocessing systems; Decoding",,,,,"Peterson, W.W., Weldon, E.J., (1972) Error-Correcting Codes, , Comabridge, MA: MIT Press; Lin, S., Costello Jr., D.J., (2004) Error Control Coding: Fundamentals and Applications (2nd Edition), , NJ: Prentice Hall; Sarwate, D.V., Shanbhag, N.R., High-speed architecture for reed-solomon decoder (2001) IEEE Trans.

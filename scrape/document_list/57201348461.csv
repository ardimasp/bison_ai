People in South Kalimantan usually serve mandai as a side dish, but on this occasion, mandai will be used as a material to make dodol, chewy, sweet, and thick cake which usually made from glutinous rice flour, coconut milk, and palm sugar. This study aims to determine public acceptance of dodol mandai through the distribution of product samples and the distribution of questionnaires regarding its aroma, colour, texture and taste. This research used a descriptive analysis method that is divided into statistical descriptive analysis and frequency analysis. The result shows that the public accepts processed products made from mandai. The products are different from the others and are innovation products based on local wisdom and thus, they add traditional culinary repertoire. The result is as predicted, that mandai can be processed into dodol. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Dodol; Mandai; Product inovation",,,,,,"The authors are grateful to Prof. Bahtiar Saleh Abbas as Director of Research & Technology Transfer Office and Dezie Leonarda Warganegara, as the Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Communication, as well as the Hotel Management Lecturer who provided the facilities required for the preparation of this paper.","Bakar, M.

A program aimed to empower local communities to prepare work plans and activities to enrich the various potential development of sustainable tourism. By empowering local community, business competition has led to the undesired development of the tourism sector. This becomes the concern of the negative impact of physical changes in the area.

This study considers how to determine acceptable levels of impact that occurs in the Pangandaran area. This method involves stakeholders in determining the values, issues, and concerns the acceptable levels of impact for this region. The result of acceptance rate then compared with the effects of the current state. Through review and analysis methods used in this study, the LAC situation in Pangandaran outlined. Results from this study are expected to identify indicators of sustainable development of tourism sector through LAC approach. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Competition; Java programming language; Business competition; Indicators of sustainable development; Physical changes; Sustainable tourism; Sustainable tourism development; Tourism development; Tourism sectors; Tourist attractions; Sustainable development",,,,,"Authors wishing to acknowledge the support of Bina Nusantara Research and Technology Transfer (RTTO) Department for granting this research of year 2016.

The purpose of this research is to examine the two main factors of Solo towards tourist attraction. The research method is quantitative. Data collected from observation and survey. A total of 113 respondents obtained from accidental sampling method. The results indicate based on cognitive and affective image. Cognitive consists of culture, batik, city tagline, and community. While, affective consists of tradition, culinary, purposes, climate, and welcoming. The findings show that image has weak correlation towards tourist attraction of Solo. It means most of the tourists are not influenced by city image when they choose Solo as one of their travel destination. The differences between primary and minor image are also examined. Research implication is directed for local government to pursue continuous improvement particularly for the branding of Solo. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","affective; city image; cognitive; destination; tourism","affective; city image; cognitive; destination; tourism",,,,,,"Martins, M., The tourist Imagery the Destination Image and the Brand Image (2015) Journal of Tourism and Hospitality Management, 3 (2), p. 1; Sia, J.K.M., Lew, T.Y., Sim, A.K.S., Miri city as a festival destination image in the context of Miri (2015) Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, 172, p. 68; Souiden, N., Ladhari, R., Chiadmi, N.E., Destination personality and destination image (2017) Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, 32, p. 54. , 55; Kani, Y., Aziz, Y.A., Sambasivan, M., Bojei, J., Antecedents and outcomes of destination image of Malaysia (2017) Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, 32, p. 89; Hernández-Mogollóna, J.M., Duarteb, P.A., Folgado-Fernándezc, J.A., The contribution of cultural events to the formation of the cognitive and affective images of a tourist destination (2017) Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, p. 2; Sia, J.K.M., Lewb, T.Y., Sim, A.K.S., Miri city as a festival destination image in the context of Miri Country Music Festival (2015) Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, 172, p. 68. , 69; Teodorescu, N., Stǎncioiu, A.F., Rǎvar, A.S., Boto, A., Creativity and innovation Sources of competitive advantage in the value chain of tourism enterprises (2015) Theoretical and Applied Economics, 22, p. 36; Manoa, A., Costa, R.A.D., A conceptual model of the antecedents and consequences of tourist destination image (2015) Procedia Economics and Finance 23, 23, p. 17; Martín-Santana, J.D., Beerli-Palacio, A., Nazzareno, P.A., Antecedents and consequences of destination image gap (2017) Annals of Tourism Research, 62, p. 13. , 15; Sam, S., Huang, J., Exploring Mainland Chinese students motivations of re-visiting Hong Kong as a familia place and their links to student life experiences (2016) Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, p. 2; Xu, J., Huang, S., Exploring Mainland Chinese students motivations of re-visiting Hong Kong as a familiar place and their links to student life experiences (2016) Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, p. 2; Swarbrooke, J., Horner, S., (2007) Consumer Behaviour in Tourism, , (Oxford: Elsevier)",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","4th International Conference on Friendly City 2017","11 October 2017 through 12 October 2017",,135340,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

In this research, type I-Girder WIKA standard for bridges were considered with longitudinal spansof 35 m, transverse spans of 12.4 m, girder heightof2100 mm. The purpose of this study to calculate the deflection and stress at the girder with different standard for Highway Bridge.Three standards considered for this comparison including of Bina Marga, AASHTO, and British Standard.Based on the analysis, it was found that the value of the stress in the Ultimate Limit Stress (ULS) and Service Limit State (SLS)and the value of deflection are still below the allowable values. This indicates that the type I-Girder considered is meet all the criteria implied by the three design standards. The important aspect when designing a prestressed concrete bridge is a combination of loading, the resistance factor, the design criteria, and the limit valueof deflection. The different parameter between the design ctandardis the value of the resistance factor. Bina Marga and AASHTO standards use the resistance factor values of 0.75 and 0.9, while for a British Standard resistant factor is not adopted but the value of material factor (γm) is used with the value of 1.15. The value for short-term lossdue to concrete shortening of Bina Margais equal to zero. This is due to the tendon are tensionedsimultaneously. According to British Standard, long-term losses due to creep and shrinkage are calculated together, however for Bina Marga and the AASHTO LRFD calculations, separate analysis are required. © Research India Publications.","Design Standards; Prestressed Highway Bridge",,,,,,"(2012) AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design specifications; (2011) Perencanaan Struktur Beton Pratekan Untuk Jembatan, , 021/BM/2011; Hussein, A., Strength Design Requirements of ACI-318M-02 Code, BS 8110, and EuroCode2 for Structural Concrete: A Comparative Study (2006) Journal of Engineering and Development, 10 (1); Lin, T.Y., (1963) Design of Prestressed Concrete Structure, , (2nd edition).New York:Wiley International Edition; Sankar, Midhun, B., Jacob, Priya, A., Comparison of Design Standarts for Steel Railways Bridges (2013) Journal of Engineering Research and Aplications(IJERA), pp. 1131-1138","Hidayat, I.; Civil Engineering Department, Bina Nusantara UniversityIndonesia",,,"Research India Publications",,,,,09734562,,,,"English","Int.

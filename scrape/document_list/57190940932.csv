Collaborative Learning means group-based environment that combination of lecturing in big class and case study in tutorial class. This research discusses the best practice of collaborative learning to measure collaborative learning implementation in higher education, that improve the quality of collaborative learning implementation. This study contains an evaluation of collaborative learning in courses of information systems based on the subjective perspective of students. The primary data collected during this research consist of 243 respondents as students. The courses that being analyzed in this research are Information System Concept and Management Information System course. Data analysis was using SEM-PLS. This research has 3 (three) hypotheses that already tested, and the result is accept the Content Delivery (CD), but not significant with Planning and Organization (PO), and Learning Methodology (LM). Based on the result, the conclusion for best practice implementation of collaborative learning was to improve the content delivery material and how to deliver the content, such as selecting collaboration tools, capable lecturers, adding more video and fun grouping, also use different learning methods, such as flipped learning, online quiz to make the classroom situation fun and not boring for students. © 2019 IEEE.","collaboration tools; collaborative learning; collaborative learning quality; evaluation; quality","Boring tools; Image quality; Information management; Information use; Quality control; Students; Collaboration Tool; Collaborative learning; Collaborative learning process; Collaborative learning tools; Content delivery; evaluation; Higher education; Traditional learning; Learning systems",,,,,"Meyliana, Chandra, Y.U., Analysis of higher education student's behavior factors to posting a comment on E-commerce with stimulus organism response (SOR) model (2019) 2018 Int.

One of the success factor in e-learning is good web usability. With the increasing number of users of e-learning and the importance of user satisfaction, it is necessary to evaluate e-learning web usability. This research discussed the usability of online learning in higher Education, especially Binus University. The purpose of this research is evaluating e-learning web usability by using USE questionnaire to survey e-learning perception from the users that can improve the quality of e-learning. The data collected during this research are using questionnaires with total 37 respondents which are online learning students. The USE Questionnaire based on several criterias, as Usefulness, Satisfaction, Ease of Learning and Ease of Use, then evaluation, analysis, and interpretation of data. The final results of this study conclude that Binus Online Learning still need improvement on ease of use and satisfaction categories so as to provide better usability to the users. © 2016 IEEE.","E-learning; Evaluation; Learning; Online learning; Usability","Bins; Education; Information management; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Usability engineering; Evaluation; Higher education; Interpretation of data; Learning; Online learning; Quality of teaching; Usability; User satisfaction; E-learning",,,,,"Pearson, K.E., Saunders, C.S., (2009) Strategic Management Information Systems, , Florida : John Willey & Sons, Inc; KipkuruiKiget, N., Wanyembi, P.G., Peters, A., Evaluating usability of e-learning systems in universities,department of computer science, masindemuliro university of science and technology, kakamega, Kenya, department of information technology, mt.

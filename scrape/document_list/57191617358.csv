Academic Information system has been turned into a necessity for every single university as an instrument to deliver the simplicity of manipulating students data as well as the organizations data in an academic institution. The rate of a successful information system could be achieved by user's acceptance level which shows the acceptance of the users when using the system. This study will focus to the implementation of Oracle Peoplesoft Campus Solutions (OPCS) as an academic information system named MyUMN at Universitas Multimedia Nusantara with Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) method. The purpose of this research is to analyze the UTAUT variables that is able to influence the interest and behavior of the users (students, instructors, and staffs) to the academic information system MyUMN and recommend an improvement to the system. The data collecting method was done by deploying questionares through an e-mail with sample of 423 respondents, while the data analysis was done by using Structural Equation Model (SEM) along with version 23 of AMOS software. The result indicated that the Performance Expectancy and Social Influence is significantly related one to another with Behavioral Intentions. But, in another way the Effort Expectancy indicated no effect on it. Facilitating Conditions and Behavioral Intentions were showing the significant effect of user's behavior to the academic information system MyUMN. © 2016 IEEE.","MyUMN; structural equation modeling; Technology Acceptance; UTAUT","Behavioral research; Information systems; Academic institutions; Behavioral intention; Facilitating conditions; MyUMN; Structural equation modeling; Technology acceptance; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); UTAUT; Education",,,,,"Albright Jeremy, J., Hun Myoung, P., (2009) Confirmatory Factor Analysis Using Amos, LISREL, Mplus SAS/STAT CALIS, , University Information Technology Services Center for Statistical and Mathematical Computing Indiana University; Alotaibi Sara, J., Mike, W., Discussion and evaluation of the updated UTAUT model in IAMSs (2014) Journal of Intelligent Computing Research (IJICR), 5 (1-2); Alrawashdeh, T.A., Muhairat, M.I., Alqatawnah, S.M., Factors Affecting Acceptance of Web-Based Training System: Using Extended UTAUT and Structural Equation Modeling, , unpublished; Davis, F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3), pp. 319-340; DeVellis, R.F., (1991) Scale Development: Theory & Applications, , Newbury Park, CA: SAGE Publications; Dan Graeser, W.S., Peter, B., Graeser, V., Willcocks, L.P., Measuring organizational IS effectiveness: An overview and update of senior management perspectives (2002) The Database for Advances in Information Systems, 33 (2), pp. 11-28; Ghozali, I., (2004) Model Persamaan Struktural Konsep Dan Aplikasi Dengan Program AMOS 22.0, , Badan Penerbit Universitas Diponegoro.

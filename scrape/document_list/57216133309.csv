This is a human trait inherited from generation to generation. Where we can feel happy, interested or amazed by the beauty of nature. The rapid development and technological advances make our relationship with nature farther away. As a result, we become indifferent to the environment around us, the degeneration of ecosystems, and cause mental disorders and stress. Stress and stress disorders are problems that are often experienced by office workers in big cities like Jakarta. There are 60.8% of office workers experiencing depression and stress. One factor causing stress is the work environment, which is a dense urban area. Therefore, rebuilding our relationship with nature becomes more important in the field of conservation. The concept of biophilic design is a design approach based on biophilia aspects which aims to produce coworking spaces that can reduce stress and provide mental and physical healing to its users. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Biophilic design; coworking space; sustainable architecture","Architecture; Office buildings; Sustainable development; coworking space; Dense urban areas; Design approaches; Mental disorders; Stress disorders; Sustainable architecture; Technological advances; Work environments; Occupational risks",,,,,"Amjad, A., Asaad, A., Abdushaik, Z.K., Khalil, S., Biophilic architecture, the concept of healthy sustainable architecture (2006) PLEA2006-23rd International Conference on Passive and Low Energy Architecture, Conference Proceedings, pp. 1383-1386; Browning, W., Ryan, C., Clancy, J., (2014) Fourteen Patterns of Biophilic Design; Ana, H., Biophilic Design, Restorative Environments and Well-Being (2014) 9th International Conference on Design and Emotion 2014: The Colors of Care; Kellert, S., Heerwagen, J., Mador, M., (2008) Biophilic Design: The Theory, Science, and Practice of Bringing Buildings to Life; Ryan Catherine, O., BIOPHILIC DESIGN PATTERNS: Emerging Nature-Based Parameters for Health and Well-Being in the Built Environment (2014) International Journal of Architectural Research: ArchNet-IJAR, [S.l.], 8, pp. 62-76; Wilson, E.O., (1984) Biophilia: The Human Bond with Other Species","Suharjanto, G.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: gatotsuharjanto@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

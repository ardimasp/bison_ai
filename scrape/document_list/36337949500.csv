Ethereum token (ERC-20) can tokenize any real-world object while it is also possible to exchange the token across the network participants. This utility from the token drives many blockchain enthusiasts to create decentralized applications. ERC-20 token could be used to collect project funds, decision voting, or even can be used to provide investment platforms for people that want to hedge the volatility of the currency with buying an asset that is back to back with the crypto-token. This research shows the main characteristics of asset-backed token and its implementation on a complete end-to-end “digitalization assets system” (assets buy and assets redemption). The result shows that asset-backed token needs support from government and other legalizing parties to verify the legitimacy of the asset that backing the token itself. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Asset-backed token; Blockchain; ERC-20; Ethereum; Token","Ethereum; Financial markets; Fintech; Commodity exchange; End to end; Real-world objects; Blockchain",,,,,,,"Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System; Konstantinidis, I., Siaminos, G., Timplalexis, C., Blockchain for business applications: a systematic literature review (2018) Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, pp. 384-399. , Springer International Publishing; Rosati, P., Čuk, T., (2019) Blockchain beyond cryptocurrencies.

In this article, we propose a framework for detecting web application vulnerabilities by combining all three methods. The strengths of one method are used to overcome the weaknesses of another method.

The complexity of the software can increase the possibility of defects. Defective software can cause high losses. Fixing defective software requires a high cost because it can spend up 50% of the project schedule. Most software developers don't document their work properly so that making it difficult to analyse software development history data. Software metrics which use in cross-project software defects prediction have many features. Software metrics usually consist of various measurement techniques, so there are possibilities for their features to be similar. It is possible that these features are similar or irrelevant so that they can cause a decrease in the performance of classifiers. In this study, several feature selection techniques were proposed to select the relevant features. The classification algorithm used is Naive Bayes. Based on the analysis using ANOVA, the SBS and SBFS models can significantly improve the performance of the Naïve Bayes model. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bayesian networks; Defects; Feature extraction; Sodium compounds; Classification algorithm; Development history; Measurement techniques; Performance of classifier; Relevant features; Selection techniques; Software defect prediction; Software developer; Software design",,,,,,,"Adak, M.F., Software defect detection by using data mining based fuzzy logic (2018) 2018 Sixth Int.

With customer payments, it is usually easier to make payments with mobile payment, because it is more practical and direct than mobile banking. However, is the privacy of both platforms understood by the customer? Research questions to be answered: 1) What are the factors that influence privacy issues in mobile banking? 2) What are the factors that influence privacy issues with mobile payments? 3) What are the factors that influence confidence in mobile banking? 4) What are the factors that influence confidence in mobile payments? 5) Does the privacy factor influence the perceived privacy? 6) Does the confidence factor influence the perceived privacy? There are two research models and 12 (twelve) hypotheses for each model. Privacy risk, subjective norm, information management factors positive influence on privacy interest, and trust.

It is an electronic certificate that is used for traditional boat and fishing vessel of less than 7 gross tonnage. This electronic certificate is for the first time being applied to a ship in Indonesia. This marks a new era for ship certification in Indonesia. The conventional paper format of certification had been applied before it was changed to electronic certification. Indonesia is implementing electronic certificates on traditional vessels and fishing vessels of less than 7 gross tonnage due to several reasons. The first is the need for durable form material due to lifetime validation of certificates. The second due to problems related to misuse of previous type of conventional paper format certificates that caused difficulties in determining the number of this type of vessels in Indonesia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Fisheries; Ships; Electronic certification; Indonesia; Paper formats; Safe operation; Sea transportation; Fishing vessels",,,,,,,"Maritime Organization, I., (2016) Guidelines for the Use of Electronic Certificates; Direktur Jenderal Perhubungan Laut, , Surat Edaran No. SE.87/PK/DK/2019 Penerapan Pas Kecil Elektronik Sebagai Pengganti Pas Kecil Untuk Kapal Dengan Ukuran Tonase Kotor Kurang Dari GT.7 Pada Kantor Kesyahbandaran Dan Otoritas Pelabuhan Kelas IV Muara Angke; Ferrell, O., Harline, M., (2005) Marketing Strategy; Bickerstaff, K., Tolley, R., Walker, G., Transport planning and participation: The rhetoric and realities of public involvement (2002) J.

Speech as input to Google is known as the Ok Google feature. However, many search engine users never pay attention to search engine definitions. So, websites are only limited to projects without further management, and that is what happens to the current website. Therefore, in this study, an assessment of usability is conducted on Google especially in the Ok Google feature using Nielsen Model. The research method used in this research is the quantitative research approach, a method which includes approach and kind of research, population and sample, instrument, data collection technique, and data analyze. Data collection techniques include learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors and satisfaction assessment and Likert scale ranges from 1 to 4. It can be signed into categories of sites with usability values, namely “very difficult to understand,” “difficult to understand”, “easy to understand” and “very easy to understand”. The construct validity is with Orthogonal Iterations with Index reliability of 0.91. The results of this study are the usability testing of Ok Google tends to be significance (α) of 5% with data of 124 is 1.66, feedback statement in the questionnaire is considered valid, then the questionnaire results show α = 0.91 which means the measurement of usability on Ok Google Feature is an excellent level. The average usability value obtained by Ok Google in Indonesia is included in the category of usability “easy to understand”. In addition, it was found that Ok Google has the highest memorability level and the lowest error. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Speech recognition; Usability; Website",,,,,,,,"Qustoniah, A., Perancangan Sistem Pengenalan Pola Suara Menggunakan Metode Piecewise Dynamic Time Warping (2012) Widya Tek, 20 (1), pp. 11-17; Ronando, E., Irawan, M.I., Pengenalan Ucapan Kata Sebagai Pengendali Metode Linear Predictive Coding—Neuro Fuzzy (2012) J.

To allocate land use properly, the zoning method has been widely used, especially in densely populated cities, namely a kind of sustainable urban form with considers the mix of use/diversity of land use to minimize travel distance. This study proposes a method for calculating how much a city meets the sustainable urban forms based on compact city criteria, i.e. compatibility, dependency, and compactness. After the survey filling in compatibility and dependency scores for each land use, and compactness was calculated for each sub-district. Fuzzy C-Means clustering was used to cluster the result to classify other areas. In addition, this method can be used by planners to check whether their plans meet the concept of sustainable development or not. © 2019 IEEE.","city plan; compactness; compatibility; dependency; sustainable urban form","Land use; Sustainable development; City planners; Compact city; Filling in; Fuzzy C means clustering; Self-learning; Travel distance; Urban sustainability; Zoning method; Planning",,,,,,,"Curwell, S., Deakin, M., Symes, M., (2005) Sustainable Urban Development, 1. , United Kingdom Routledge; Steiner, F., (2008) The Living Landscape-An Ecological Approach to Landscape Planning-Second Edition, , Washington DC ISLAND PRESS; Handayanto, R., Tripathi, N.K., Kim, S.M., Herlawati, H., Land use growth simulation and optimization for achieving a sustainable urban form (2018) TELKOMNIKA Telecommunication Comput.

This paper describes the process to predict the oscillation condition in power system as an alarm to the operator before the oscillation could cause power system outage. Using PMU, the phasor sifting data of power system could be observed and treated to achieve the quantitative measures. To process the phasor measurement data, Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is utilized to extract specific parameters such as instantaneous power of individual correspondent frequency. These parameters are fed to an artificial neural network (ANN) to distinguish between a stable and an oscillating condition. The ANN is trained with simulated data that represents the stable and oscillating conditions which might be taking place in power system. To increase the prediction precision, the majority vote algorithm is used for all results from the ANN. The speed of the prediction process is compared with the time of an actual event which causes an outage in the power system, in order to determine the effectiveness of the process model. These suggest that the model might be used, since the computation time of prediction model is faster than the time of the power system outage. © 2019 ICIC International.

In the context of Information Overload, an additional load of information does not always increase benefits to users. In the previous study, a KMS MR framework was designed to address Information Overload. Following that, this research follows through earlier research by experimenting with a case study. The case study involved students working on quizzes that were allowed to open the Internet, open books, and KMS applications with a 30-minute time limit. In this baseline, the research question ushers on the impact of the implementation of the KMS MR framework in the case study and whether to improve the information quality perceived by students. The research method is based on experimental, questionnaires and statistics for processing data and decision making. In addition, this study intends to evince the reliability of the KMS MR framework in overcoming the Information Overload issue. At the end of the study, the results indicated the gap of 1.50 points as the differences in the value of information quality between the two groups of KMS MR and KMS. Per this outcome, the KMS MR framework is capable of improving the information quality and shifting the culmination point of Information Overload. © 2019 ISSN.","Case study; Information overload (IO); KMS MR; Knowledge management system (KMS); MapRe-duce",,,,,,,,"Eppler, M.

The EA supports achieving organizational goals because of its functions. This paper discusses the results of literature review for the EA function. There are at least three reasons for using EA in organizations: its complexity, external force to change, and the alignment of business with Information Technology (IT). Furthermore, this paper also discusses how the EA functions can offer benefit for the Village Law. The Village Law is a legal product in Indonesia that is used as a legal umbrella to build Indonesia. A proper EA function perspective is needed to build a village supported by information technology. © BEIESP.","Alignment; Anticipate Change; Enterprise Architecture; Function of Enterprise Architecture; Reduce Complexity; The Village Law",,,,,,,,"Bailey, I., A simple guide to enterprise architecture (2006) Model Futur; (2014) Undang-Undang Desa, 1. , No. 6 Tahun2014; Ed, H.J., (2017) Architecture Content Framework with the Archimate Modelling Language, , March; Alwadain, A., Fielt, E., Korthaus, A., Rosemann, M., Empirical insights into the development of a service-oriented enterprise architecture (2016) Data Knowl.

Each data taken will be preprocessing, where the process was done by removing punctuation, hash tags and conversion of several emojis to text. By using the polyglotlibrary, determining an emotion from each term can be done more easily because the library can recognize various languages, including Indonesian. This experiment achieves55.41% accuracy.

To avoid fraud, it can be done by blockchain technology by the use of University, Company, Traceability, Profit and Policy-making of crypto-governance. Crypto-governance is able to use IBM using hyperledger fabric protocol and private blockchain network. Muhammadiyah Tangerang University (UMT) saved the graduate documents storage manually by human resources. Moreover, it would be wasting time for many tasks, for example when staffs searched database, they would consume a lot of time and the graduate documents were vulnerable to damage in the disaster. Based on the problems above it would face the research questions; how did we keep the graduate documents storage secure and how it could be authentic guaranteed? Blockchain technology with distributed ledger and consensus is considered to overcome this problem.

Our result illustrates that the support vector machine has a 0.92 (92%) accuracy value and a 0.927 (92.7%) precision value. The support vector machine has the highest result, when compared with other classification algorithms. Our novel method uses a static analysis to extract the function call based sensitive function list correctly and not just as a keyword. The source codes that read as a bag of words or read with neuro linguistic programming are prone to a false positive detection. This is because the source code language has different structures compared with the regular language. The source code uses a static analysis to extract its abstract syntax tree structures. © ICIC International 2019.","Classification; Function call; Static analysis; Web shell backdoor",,,,,,,,"Christianini, N., Shawe-Taylor, J., (2000) An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-Based Learning Methods, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Hagen, B., Behrens, S., (2013) Web Shell Detection Using Neopi; Canali, D., Balzarotti, D., Francillon, A., The role of web hosting providers in detecting compromised websites (2013) Proc. of the 22Nd International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 177-188; Chess, B., West, J., (2007) Secure Programming with Static Analysis, Pearson Education; Cooper, K., Torczon, L., (2011) Engineering a Compiler, , Elsevier; (2011) Php Shell Detector: Web Shell Detection Tool; (2013) R-Fx Network, Linux Malware Detect; Grune, D., van Reeuwijk, K., Bal, H.E., Jacobs, C.J.H., Langendoen, K., (2012) Modern Compiler Design, , Springer Science & Business Media; Hagan, M.T., Demuth, H.B., Beale, M.H., (1996) Neural Network Design, , Pws Pub., Boston; Kim, J., Yoo, D.-H., Jang, H., Jeong, K., Webshark 1.0: A benchmark collection for malicious web shell detection (2015) Journal of Information Processing Systems, 11 (2), pp. 229-238; Xu, M., Chen, X., Hu, Y., Design of software to search ASP web shell (2012) Procedia Engineering, 29, pp. 123-127; (2018) Web Server Survey, 2018. , January; Rish, I., An empirical study of the naive Bayes classifier (2001) IJCAI 2001 Workshop on Empirical Methods in Artificial Intelligence, 3, pp. 41-46; Safavian, S.R., Landgrebe, D., A survey of decision tree classifier methodology (1991) IEEE Trans.

Using data of phasor sifting in power system available through Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) implementation, power system oscillations could be observed directly. However, to predict the condition of power system, the recorded phasor data need to be processed to obtain the quantitative measures. In this paper, important parameters are extracted by applying Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) to phasor signal taken from PMU. The stable and oscillation condition are determined by the parameters that show the increasing power of each frequency over period of time. Validation is conducted by using simulation data that represents characteristic of PMU data. © 2019 Buyung Sofiarto Munir et al.","Hilbert-Huang Transform; Instantaneous power; Phasor measurement unit; Power system oscillation; Stable signal",,,,,,,,"Phadke, A.G., Synchronized phasor measurements in power systems (1993) IEEE Computer Applications in Power, 6 (2), pp. 10-15; Deb, G., Chakraborty, K., Gauss-Seidel Method based Voltage Security Analysis of Distribution System (2018) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE), 8 (1), pp. 43-51; Zhang, Q., Vittal, V., Heydt, G.T., Logic, N., Sturgill, S., The integrated calibration of synchronized phasor measurement data in power transmission systems (2011) IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, 26 (4), pp. 2573-2581; Munir, B.S., Trisetyarso, A., Field Data Accuracy Analysis of Phasor Measurement Unit Application (2016) In 2016 8th International Conference on Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ICITEE), pp. 8-11. , Yogyakarta, Indonesia; Zhou, M., Centeno, V., Thorp, J.S., Phadke, A.G., Calibrating instrument transformers with phasor measurements (2012) Electric Power Components and Systems, 40 (14), pp. 1605-1620; Patel, V.S., Bhil, S.K., Kazi, F.S., Wagh, S.R., Energy-sorted Prony analysis for identification of dominant low frequency oscillations.

With gamification, a lot of people help people learn something natural, and gamification is usually inspired by everyday life, for example, the game The Sims, which combines daily life with a game in sports is one of the best examples of gamification implementation. Using gamification in a game makes learning more enjoyable than learning with truth, and without realizing it they have done learning. In this paper we proposed a gamification architecture for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) which include logic game such as brain, think, body, move, sport and logic. Moreover, there are five methods proposed for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) such as object game, content, and player, design, and framework, deploy and play, and finish structure. © 2018 IEEE.","ADHD games;

The popularity of the game has raised the attention of many researchers from various research domains. But there are some problems in game design. One of these problems is a game adaptation that can be defined freely as the game's ability to adapt to various factors such as: gamer's skills, emotion playing, layer formats, and hardware platforms. The purpose of this paper is to propose a case-based reasoning (CBR)-based game architecture for designing adaptive text-based computer games that will be used as a delivery of high performance computing (HPC) learning. © 2018 IEEE.","Adaptive; case-based reasoning (CBR); Design; Game; High Performance Computing (HPC)","Case based reasoning; Design; Pattern recognition; Adaptive; Casebased reasonings (CBR); Game; Game architecture; Hardware platform; High performance computing; High performance computing (HPC); Research domains; Computer games",,,,,,,"Prasad, S.K., Chtchelkanova, A., Dehne, F., Gouda, M., Gupta, A., Jaja, J., Kant, K., Wu, J., (2012) NSF/IEEE-TCPP Curriculum Initiative on Parallel and Distributed Computing-Core Topics for Undergraduates, 55p. , www.cs.gsu.edu/-tcpp/curriculum/index.php, Version I,.

In this corridor, the growth of digital content in the system seems to have a positive impact on the organization. However, this continued growth is not always beneficial for the organization over time. In this context, the con- dition is renowned as Information Overload (IO) in the system. The research question in the study is to determine the KMS framework to overcome the information overload issue. As this backdrop, the paper provides the KMS framework guidance to overcome IO issues based on the MapReduce approach. In this respect, this study aims to be a useful reference framework for organizations that address IO problems. The method in this study refers to literature studies which collect various references related to KMS and MapReduce algorithm. It directs to the use of in-depth observation to build the frame- work. Ultimately, this study concludes that the production of KMS MapReduce framework has been completed and set prepared for the implementation in a real case.

Nevertheless, because of the lack of literature on the smart IPO framework, we refer to smart government and smart city framework. The aim of this paper is to propose a framework for smart IPO in developing countries in the context of smart city framework. The study found that smart IPO composed of several components such as 1) Smart IPO Model; 2) Smart IPO Enterprise Architecture; 3) Smart IPO Collaboration Model; 4) Smart IPO Development Model; 5) Smart IPO Measurement Model; 6) Smart IPO Standard; and 7) Smart IPO Services. It also found that there are four models of IP office as follows: Model 1 (basic web-based, public services); Model 2 (advanced internal administration); Model 3 (full process automation); and Model 4 (knowledge-based IP services). Moreover, we found also three stages of IP development model: Stage 1 (automation of internal processes); Stage 2 (web-based e-services); Stage 3 (e-dossier, e-filing, e-payment). © 2019 The Authors.","IP office; IT governance; Smart IP office framework","Developing countries; Information use; Knowledge based systems; Patents and inventions; Public administration; Smart city; Websites; Collaboration models; Computer-implemented Inventions; Economic development; Enterprise Architecture; IP office; IT governance; Smart IP office framework; Theoretical framework; Internet protocols",,,,,,,"What is intellectual property?

However, to maintain credibility, trust from the public on service and learning capabilities as well as recognition extensively are needed. To measure capability in service and learning can be displayed by the technology used during all activities at the university. In this study, an analysis was conducted on the influence of ICT and Public Recognition on University Credibility by using Multiple Linear Regression test. The data used are questionnaire with 13 items representing three variables, namely Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Public Recognition, and University Credibility. Each instrument that is distributed and obtained was used to test the validity and reliability of the items. The results show that 61% of ICT and Public Recognition are proved to influence the credibility of the university. This shows that ICT and Public Regulations play a significant role in showing University Credibility where this can be used as a benchmark in improving good perceptions of university selection. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Credibility; ICT; Public; Recognition; Regression","Linear regression; Credibility; Information and Communication Technologies; Learning capabilities; Multiple linear regressions; Public; Recognition; Regression; Database systems",,,,,,,"Freeman, R.B., What does global expansion of higher education mean for the United States?

New horizons emerged with the implementation of the BI concept using “Cloud Computing”. The leading IT companies compete to develop BI cloud-based services (cloud BI). This study aimed to determine the factors influencing manager decision to adopt cloud BI in Indonesia’s financial service sector, using the diffusion of innovation (DOI) model and technology organization environment (TOE) framework. The research also obtains prediction of the cloud BI marketing trend in Indonesia. The survey conducted with 30 participants at the senior management level in Indonesia’s financial services sector. The findings reveal, the adoption rate of cloud BI in Indonesia financial service sector still very low. Only 3.4% of firms have implemented cloud BI, while 10% not considering the cloud BI adoption. The results of this research can be used by vendors to develop cloud BI tools that fit into the customer’s need. It is also very useful for marketers to know the characteristics and demographics of cloud BI users. For regulators, this research illustrates how and what drives regulators to make policies that can encourage companies to use the latest technology. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cloud BI; Cloud business intelligence; DOI framework; TOE framework","Commerce; Database systems; Information analysis; Marketing; Surveys; Business intelligent; Cloud business; Diffusion of innovations; DOI framework; Financial services sector; Senior management; Technology-organization-environment frameworks; TOE framework; Finance",,,,,,,"Olszak, C.M., Toward better understanding and use of business intelligence in organizations (2016) Inf.

Specifically review the effects of facilitation methods and teacher involvement in student participation in online discussion forums. In the trial attended by 94 teachers, 193 classes and 5104 students, to compare the level of student participation in the online discussion forums held in all study programs in the Faculty of Law, Faculty of Law, University of Pamulang The participation of the students as the dependent variable in the two methods facilitated the discussion, the discussion was facilitated by the students as an experimental class and the discussions were facilitated by the teachers as a kind of control. Teacher participation as a covariate. In general, the results show that the amount of student participation in student issues initiated by the students is superior to the discussion topics initiated by the teachers, once the level of teacher participation is adjusted. The discussion topic made by the students encourages students to participate more than the topic of discussion made by the teachers, because the students are more interested in the topics that interest them. This study has the effect of facilitating participation in online learning discussion forums at the level of student participation. The results also show that the freedom granted to students to make the topic of discussion is not influenced by the size or participation of the teacher. © 2019 The Authors.","E-learning; Effectiveness of learning; Facilitation methods","Information systems; Information use; Learning systems; Online systems; Social networking (online); Students; Dependent variables; Discussion forum; Effectiveness of learning; Electronic learning systems; Facilitation methods; Online discussion forums; Online learning; Student participation; E-learning",,,,,,,"Jacobson, D., Chapman, R., Ye, C., Os, J.V., A project-based approach to executive education (2017) Journal of Innovative Educations; Allen, E., Seaman, J., (2009) Learning on Demand, , Babson; Ferre, C., Glynn, H., Wiest, Lynda, R., Effective online instruction in higher education (2012) Quarterly Review of Distance Education, 13 (1), pp. 11-14; Romero, C., Lopez, M.I., Luna, J.M., Ventura, S., (2013) Predicting Students Final Performance from Participation in On-Online Discussion Forum, , Elsevier; Wisneski, J.E., Ozogul, G., Bichelmeyer, B.A., (2015) Does Teaching Presence Transfer between MBA Teaching Environments?

The use of the flipped classroom has been running in this department for four semesters, where in one semester, each class gets a subject that is taught by a flipped classroom method. Questionnaires were distributed online among students from level one to three in October 2018 and 249 respondents were obtained. The data obtained were analyzed using descriptive statistics in order to study the perception of the students about the application of the flipped classroom, both in general and from the four aspects of the engagement: behavioral, emotional, cognitive and agentic engagement. The results obtained show that most of the respondents (61%) agreed with the use of flipped classroom because the class became more fun. In terms of engagement, behavioral engagement has the highest mean value of 3.12 while agent engagement has the lowest mean value of 2.42. It means that students have shown an attitude to follow the flipped classroom method but have not actively participated. The rest where students disagreed with flipped classroom is due to lecturers assumed unprepared and/or students have difficulty learning by themselves. © IAEME Publication.","Aspects; Engagement; Evaluation; Flipped Learning; Perception",,,,,,,,"Chicca, J., Shellenbarger, T., Connecting with generation Z: Approaches in nursing education (2018) Teach.

Moreover, the AOI-HEP data mining technique has been improved with confidence mining pattern into two terms, where firstly give confidence mining pattern for each AOI-HEP pattern either frequent or similar pattern. Secondly, give confidence for each dataset as confidence AOI-HEP pattern between frequent and similar patterns. Confidence for each AOI-HEP pattern will show how interested each of AOI-HEP pattern between frequent and similar pattern, whilst confidence per dataset will show how interested each dataset between frequent and similar pattern. In this paper the mining of AOI-HEP has been extended to mine AOI-HEP association rules using the current AOI-HEP frequent pattern, since association rule deal with frequent pattern. Based from previous experiments upon 4 UCI machine learning datasets such as adult, breast cancer, census and IPUMS, there are 9 finding AOI-HEP frequent patterns where 8 from adult and breast cancer datasets respectively. Finally, there are 2 and 1 AOI-HEP association rules from adult and breast cancer datasets respectively. © 2018 IEEE.","AOI-HEP; Association rule; Confidence; Data Mining; frequent pattern","Association rules; Diseases; Learning systems; AOI-HEP; Attribute oriented induction; Breast Cancer; Confidence; Emerging patterns; frequent pattern; Mining associations; Similar pattern; Data mining",,,,,,,"Warnars, S., Attribute oriented induction of high-level emerging patterns (2012) Proceeding of the IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing (IEEE GrC), pp. 525-530. , Hangzhou, China; Warnars, S., Mining frequent pattern with attribute oriented induction high level emerging pattern (aoi-hep) (2014) Proceeding of IEEE the 2nd International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (IEEE ICoICT 2014), pp. 144-149. , Bandung, Indonesia; Warnars, S., Attribute oriented induction high level emerging pattern (aoi-hep) future research (2014) Proceeding of IEEE the 8th International Conference on Information & Communication Technology and Systems (ICTS), pp. 13-18. , Surabaya, Indonesia; Warnars, S., Mining frequent and similar patterns with attribute oriented induction high level emerging pattern (aoi-hep) data mining technique (2014) International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Computational and Applied Sciences (IJETCAS), 3 (11), pp. 266-276; Agrawal, R., Imieliski, T., Swami, A., Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases (1993) SIGMOD Rec, 22 (2), pp. 207-216; Agrawal, R., Srikant, R., Fast algorithms for mining association rules (1994) Proceeding of 20th International Conference on VLDB, pp. 487-499; Srikant, R., Agrawal, R., Mining quantitative association rules in large relational tables (1996) Proceeding of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data (SIGMOD '96), pp. 1-12; Dong, G., Zhang, X., Wong, L., Li, J., J.

Jakarta is one of the big cities and is the capital of Indonesia. This study aims to provide solutions to congestion problems in the capital city by maximizing the intelligent transportation system, convenient and safe for passengers. This research finds the fact that people's need for Trans Jakarta is relatively high but in fact it is not directly proportional to the public interest towards the use of Trans Jakarta buses. This study finds issues related to the needs and expectations of the community using Trans Jakarta facilities. Not only convenience and security and cheap price offered but also the ease and speed in transacting. This research provides ideas related to the facilities provided by Trans Jakarta as one of public transportation owned by the government. Combining smart phones with the use of internet-based technology (IOT). This research proposed an integrated system (integration platform). The solution with IOT-based technology enhancements makes it easy to present all information about bus availability, bus scheduling, booking places and easy online payment. This study uses a comparative study related to the needs of passengers in using Trans Jakarta. This study found the need of passengers for the existence of an integrated system that presents all information and ease of public transportation access in the city of Jakarta. © 2018 IEEE.","integration platform; integration system; Internet of Thing; online payment","Buses; Developing countries; Electronic commerce; Integrated control; Intelligent systems; Smartphones; Traffic congestion; Integration platform; Integration systems; Intelligent transportation systems; Internet based technology; On-line payment; Public transportation; Public transportation systems; Technology enhancements; Internet of things",,,,,,,"Nusraningrum, D., Isibhi, F., The influence of kiss and ride and park and ride in decreasing the private transportation by using the public transportation (2013) Transjakarta ' Nusraningrum & Isibhi, 3 (6), pp. 58-74; Gayah, V.V., Wood, J.S., (2016) Estimating Uncertainty of Bus Arrival Times and Passenger Occupancies Estimating Uncertainty of Bus Arrival Times and Passenger Occupancies; Nkurunziza, A., Zuidgeest, M., Brussel, M., Van Maarseveen, M., Modeling commuter preferences for the proposed bus rapid transit in dar-es-salaam (2012) J.

One of the benchmarks used is to measure the level of maturity of IT Governance. COBIT 5 becomes the main reference that is often used for these needs. But to do the assessment takes a long time because of the many processes assessed. This becomes an obstacle for a very dynamic company, the business has changed but the new assessment is completed. The authors propose a new approach using a priority model that adopts a enterprise strategy and incorporates it with a follow-up of previous IT Governance audit results. Tests have been conducted one of the state-owned enterprises in Indonesia engaged in the financial sector and has a dynamic business. The results showed that the assessment can effectively improve the quality of corporate IT objectives with the acceleration of the assessment process up to 20%. © 2018 IEEE.","COBIT 5; Effective assessment; Enterprise IT Goals; IT Governance; IT on State Own Company; Prioritisation Approach","COBIT 5; Effective assessment; Enterprise IT; IT governance; On state; Prioritisation Approach",,,,,,,"Steuperaert, D., Improving the quality of the COBIT 5 goals cascade as an it process prioritisation mechanism (2016) International Journal of IT/Business Alignment and Governance, 7 (2), pp. 49-69; Pasquini, A., Galie, E., COBIT 5 and the process capability model.

With large population, TransJakarta is one choice for citizens of Jakarta because TransJakarta can accomodate many passenger at once. But the problem is sometime there is uncertainty number of passenger at each stop point or shuttle bus. This cause the number of vehicles is not match with the number of passenger. Finally there will be passenger accumulation, must time wasted and unpleasant condition where passenger push each other. TransJakarta need a decision support system to optimize fleet number operated every time based on passenger number and bus capacity. Because there is uncertainty problem according to passenger number of TransJakarta in real time then fuzzy logic will be fit for this problem. But before develop the decision support system using fuzzy logic, it will be better to build the fuzzy architecture first. This architecture can be used as consideration while develop the system. Its mean that the aim of this research is to make a fuzzy architecture which support the problem. The Data Collection method used is observation. Rules implication method used is MIN method and MAX method for rules composition. While Mamdani is used for the fuzzy inferences system. © 2017 IEEE.","architecture; fuzzy logic; passenger; transjakarta; uncertainty","Architecture; Artificial intelligence; Computer architecture; Computer circuits; Fleet operations; Fuzzy logic; Data collection method; Number of vehicles; passenger; Passenger numbers; Public transportation; transjakarta; uncertainty; Uncertainty problems; Decision support systems",,,,,,,"(2015) Statistik Transportasi DKI Jakarta, , Badan Pusat Statistik, Katalog BPS., Badan Pusat Statistik., DKI Jakarta; PT.

This customers' movement is a major issue for companies as the reason most often found why customer churn. Churn management is an important program for companies to maintain valuable customers thus predicting customer churn is crucial. In literature, churn analysis has been widely studied with a various churn analysis techniques. These techniques mostly utilize customer complaint data, customer tenure, customer usage, customer payment behaviour, etc. This paper employs customer opinions from Twitter with some specific keyword. We investigate whether measurements of collective sentiment (mood) states about a product, extracted from Twitter feeds, are correlated to the value of the churn rate of the observed product. This study examines the text content of daily Twitter feeds by Convolution Neural Network that measures positive, negative or neutral sentiment. Cross-validate the resulting mood time series with Granger causality analysis was conducted. A Recurrent Neural Network was then used to test the hypothesis that mood states from Twitter are predictive of changes in churn rate values. The results indicate that the accuracy of churn rate predictions can be improved by the inclusion of specific mood dimensions, that is negative sentiment, but not others. The Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) is about 1.47%. © 2017 IEEE.","Broadband Internet; Churn Rate; Convolutional Neural Network; Granger Causality Analysis; Multivariate timeseries; Recurrent Neural Network; Twitter Opinion Mining","Convolution; Data mining; Multivariant analysis; Recurrent neural networks; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Statistical tests; Time series analysis; Broadband Internet; Churn rates; Convolution neural network; Convolutional neural network; Customer complaints; Customer payments; Granger causality analysis; Negative sentiments; Sales",,,,,,,"Adriani, M., Asian, J., Nazief, B., Tahaghoghi, S.M., Williams, H.E., Stemming Indonesian: A confix-stripping approach (2007) ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing (TALIP), 6 (4), pp. 1-33. , Dec 1; Bengio, Y., Gingras, F., Recurrent neural networks for missing or asynchronous data (1996) InAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 395-401; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8. , Mar 31; Dahiya, K., Bhatia, S., Customer churn analysis in telecom industry.

The first two offer more flexibilities but greatly differ in complexities. General-purpose language is probably overkill for a simple data entry application. In order to be useful, domain-specific language should be as close as possible to the problem domain and still open to research. This paper presents Perkedel, a domain-specific programming language designed for data entry. It is inspired by spreadsheet concept and offers user interface definitions that resemble a paper-based data entry form. Spreadsheet is one of the most popular programming systems that has been around us for almost four decades and we argue that easy user interface definition is important. This results in writing source code for a data entry application that looks nothing like ordinary source code. This speeds up the development time, too. One of our respondents spent only five minutes to a develop a simple data entry application, compared to the fastest development time of 32 minutes using a generalpurpose language, for similar application. That way, we hope that Perkedel may add a little perk to data entry developer's life using this data entry language. © 2017 IEEE.","data entry; domain-specific programming language; programming language; spreadsheet","Ada (programming language); Artificial intelligence; Computer programming languages; Data acquisition; Problem oriented languages; Spreadsheets; Development time; Domain specific languages; Domain specific programming languages; General purpose languages; General-purpose programming language; Problem domain; Programming system; Source codes; User interfaces",,,,,,,"Soewito, N.B., Gaol, F.L., Abbas, B.S., Multi-platform application user interface design (2017) The International Conference on Advanced Management and Information Technology Service; Van Deursen, A., Klint, P., Domain-specific language design reqires feature description (2002) Journal of Computing and Information Technology, 10 (1), pp. 1-7; Van Deursen, A., Klint, P., Visser, J., (2000) Domain-Specific Language: An Annotated Bibliography, Sigplan Notices, 35 (6), pp. 26-36; Ayalew, Y., Clermont, M., Mittermeir, R.T., Detecting Errors in Spreadsheets, , arXiv preprint arXiv: 0805.1740, 2008; Abraham, R., Burnett, M., Erwig, M., Spreadsheets programming (2008) Wiley Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Engineering; Power, D.J., A brif history of spreadsheets (2004) DSSResources.Com; Nardi, B.A., Miller, J.R., (1990) The Spreadsheets Interface: A Basic for End User Programming, , Hewlett-Packard Laboratories; Sebesta, R.W., (2012) Concepts of Programming Language, , 10 th ed, Pearson Education Inc; Spinellis, D., Notable design patterns for domain specific language (2001) Journal of Systems and Software, 56 (1), pp. 91-99; Mernik, M., Heering, J., Sloane, A.M., When and how to develop domain specific language (2005) ACM Comuting Surveys (CSUR), 37 (4), pp. 316-344",,,"IEEE Indonesia","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2017 IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Computational Intelligence, CyberneticsCOM 2017","20 November 2017 through 22 November 2017",,135216,,9781538607831,,,"English","IEEE Int.

News aggregator system requires a crawler to populate its content; however, different website may have a different page layout. This projects aims to create a back-end for Noox and open source and scalable web crawler that is capable to extract data from different page layout. The scope of this project includes the web crawler, CMS, API, scheduler for web crawler, and implementation of socket server. The development process utilizes PHP as the primary back-end language with Laravel as the web application framework. The PHP back-end hosts the CMS and the API. The API itself will implement Representational State Transfer (REST) as its architectural design. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is used as means of the API to communicate with the clients. The API also implements JSON Web Token (JWT) for client authentication purpose. Python programming language is used to develop the web crawler. The web crawler utilizes BeautifulSoup as the web extraction utility. The web crawler can be adapted to extract data from different page layout by utilizing user created configuration file. It can also be configured to export the extracted data into a JSON file or database system.

Software size is used to estimate schedule, effort, cost and other resource in software development process. Therefore, the best method to measure software size is to derive software attributes from requirement artifacts to get early estimation. UML sequence diagram chose as source to extract software function, since this diagram provide high level granularity of function. Functional size is measured by using COSMIC method, while structural size is calculated based on control structure on sequence diagram. To automate the measurement process, XML structure of sequence diagram is analyzed to fit existing functional and structural equation. A well-known case study of rice cooker is used to depict the proposed method in this research.

This brings a successfully decreasing in the amount of baggage mishandling. SITA 2017 reported that during 10 years until 2016 there is increasing of airline passengers, but decreasing in the amount of mishandled baggage. Many people believe that this great achievement was caused by IT implementation in baggage handling system in airport, including the massive use of RFID for baggage identification tool. Indonesia as one of the countries with the largest population had a significant increasing amount of air passengers and their baggage, that is 15% from 2015 to 2016. Until now this huge number of air baggage is stil manually handled, so Indonesia is facing a serious problem of handling the huge amount of baggage that keep growing. This paper is a preliminary literature study to iniate the development of RFID based baggage handling system in Indonesia. The research question is what is design considerations to develop RFID based baggage handling system. © 2017 IEEE.","baggage handling management; baggage handling system; RFID; systematic literature review","Airport security; Design; Information management; Materials handling equipment; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Airline passengers; Baggage handling system; Design considerations; Identification tools; Literature reviews; Literature studies; Research questions; Systematic literature review; Baggage handling",,,,,,,"(2017) Air Transport Industry Insights, the Baggage Report, , SITA; Ventura, B., BPS: Jumlah penumpang pesawat tahun 2016 capai 95,2 Juta (2017) Sindonews.com; Wyld, D.C., Jones, M.A., Totten, J.W., Where is my suitcase?

Our novel method successfully restructured the PHP parser and reduced grammar artifact objects that must be visited in a taint analysis process by up to 52% grammar variation. Taint analysis is an analysis that detects any injection vulnerability pattern in source code. The analysis identifies the information flow of untrustworthy input that affects the sensitive sink or part of the system. The static taint analysis was run on an abstract syntax tree and traversed all nodes. A static taint analysis uses a parser to traverse abstract syntax trees of the source code. A web PHP parser has 140 grammar combinations in an abstract syntax tree, which has to be traversed to recognize the tainted flow pattern.

The research focuses on conception, design, implementation and evaluation of the learning object management hypermedia API. The hypermedia API was designed based on learning object models, hypermedia concepts, and related studies. Learning object model can be represented and manipulated as a hypermedia resource. It contains page resources with text and links to multimedia elements. The hypermedia API was designed using UML and represented in HTML5 because of its rich affordance. The implementation and evaluation phase were conducted by testing the API using three different client's software to prove the concept of hypermedia as the engine of application state for managing learning objects. The results show that the hypermedia API for learning object management is accessible, consistent, and discoverable by heterogonous client applications. © 2018 The Authors.

Its purpose is to reduce unemployment, job creation, and connecting business networks. This paper proposed a study in business incubator indicator performance and to find incubator service indicator performance factor from tenant after graduation from business incubator program. To evaluate and measure incubator service performance the keywords 'indicator service performance' is applied to papers discussing business incubators and the incubation process. There are 100 of papers matching the research questions and after revision 57 papers are identified for candidate study and finally 20 papers are selected for review. The candidate proposed four services demand under business incubator such as, (P1) infrastructure service as to provide affordable space for tenants, secondly (P2) which is affordable program education for tenants. Third (P3) business services include all aspect needed by tenants. Finally, the final service (P4) business planning assistance. © 2017 IEEE.","Business incubator; Indicator service; Systematic literature review","Employment; Business incubators; Business planning; Infrastructure services; Performance factors; Research questions; Service performance; Sustainable business; Systematic literature review; Planning",,,,,,,"Mubarak Al-Mubaraki, H., Busler, M., Incubator successes: Lessons learned from successful incubators towards the twenty-first century (2014) World Journal of Science, Technology and Sustainable Development, 11 (1), pp. 44-52; Sungur, O., Business Incubators Networking Firm Survival, , Evidence from Turkey; Okoli, C., Schabram, K., A guide to conducting a systematic literature review of information systems research.

Obviously, voters' decisions are influenced by human nature characteristic which like to similarity preferences, where human like to choose someone who have full or frequent similarity in profile and/or program. Beforehand, voters should do learning by doing the characterization of their and candidate couples' profile and program. Afterwards, based on candidate couples' profile and program, the voters will do discrimination between candidate couples, classification, clustering or association among candidate couples.

However the PMU data need to be processed to obtain the quantitative measures required to predict the condition of power system. In this paper, Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) is used to process phasor measurement data from PMU to extract important parameters. These parameters are used to discriminate between stable and oscillation condition. Finally, some results using simulation data based on actual PMU data characteristic are presented and used for validation. © 2017 IEEE.","Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT); phasor measurement unit; power system oscillation","Mathematical transformations; Phase measurement; Data characteristics; Direct observations; Hilbert Huang transforms; Measurements of; Power system oscillations; Quantitative measures; Simulation data; Phasor measurement units",,,,,,,"Munir, B.S., Trisetyarso, A., Field data accuracy analysis of phasor measurement unit application (2016) 2016 8th International Conference on Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ICITEE, 2, pp. 1-4; Patel, V.S., Bhil, S.K., Kazi, F.S., Wagh, S.R., Energy-sorted Prony analysis for identification of dominant low frequency oscillations (2013) Control Conference (AUCC 3rd Australian, pp. 85-90; Ali, H.R., Inter-area power oscillation identification using synchronized ambient and ringdown data (2013) Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ICITEE), 2013 International Conference on, 1 (1), pp. 375-379; Chitturi, S., Chakrabarti, S., Singh, S.N., Comparing performance of Prony analysis and matrix pencil method for monitoring power system oscillations (2014) 2014 IEEE Innovative Smart Grid Technologies-Asia (ISGT Asia, pp. 447-452; Yang, D.C., Rehtanz, C., Li, Y., Member, S.S.S.S., Li, Y., Member, S.S.S.S., Li, Y., Member, S.S.S.S., Analysis of low frequency oscillations using improved hilbert-huang transform (2010) Power System Technology (POWERCON), 2010 International Conference on, pp. 1-7; Li, J., Xue, A., Wang, J., Ding, L., Wang, M., Bi, T., Han, F., A new node contribution factors for the low frequency oscillations of power system based on the PMU's data and HHT (2010) Critical Infrastructure (CRIS 2010 5th International Conference on, pp. 1-6; Kundu, P., Pradhan, A.K., Stability assessment using synchrophasor data (2011) Energy, Automation, Signal (ICEAS), 2011 International Conference on, 100, pp. 1-6; Kokanos, B.L., Karady, G.G., Comparison of various power system electromechanical mode estimators (2011) Power Tech IEEE Trondheim, 2011, pp. 1-6; Qing, L., Mitani, Y., Application of HHT for oscillation mode analysis in power system based on PMU (2011) Electric Power and Energy Conversion Systems (EPECS 2011 2nd International Conference on, pp. 1-4",,"Facta M.Riyadi M.A.Prasetijo A.B.Widianto E.D.Eridani D.",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","4th International Conference on Information Technology, Computer, and Electrical Engineering, ICITACEE 2017","18 October 2017 through 19 October 2017",,134244,,9781538639467,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

However, the parameters recorded by the PMU still rely on traditional installed measuring equipment. The measuring equipment has its own level of accuracy which will affect the data credibility for further analysis. Furthermore the accuracy of such data which is obtained from PMU measurement has to be known to be able to use it for future study. In this paper the field data from PMU measurements which is installed in two 500 kV substation facing one another is analyzed and compared with the results from simulation of the system to determine the accuracy of the field data. From the analysis, it can be seen that the field data taken from PMU measurements still have some error caused by the level of accuracy of measuring instruments and measurement systems used. © 2016 IEEE.","field data accuracy; measuring instruments error; phasor measurement unit","Phase measurement; Units of measurement; Data credibilities; Field data; Measurement system; Measuring equipments; Measuring instruments; New approaches; PMU measurements; Phasor measurement units",,,,,,,"Phadke, A.G., Synchronized phasor measurements in power systems (1993) IEEE Comput.

The data recorded by PMU is displayed to determine and monitor the condition of the system in real time. In the future by integrating these data with existing SCADA system, controlling and regulating the electric power system is expected to be more accurate. In this study the response time assessment of algorithm for analysing PMU data using Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) and Prony Analysis is conducted to determine which method has more advantage for using in real time PMU data.

It is shown that the tuning of the direction of the external electromagnetic fields generates perturbation on the potential temporally and spatially, determining the type of quantum logic gates. The theory underlying of this scheme is on the proposal of the intertwining operator for Darboux transfomations on one-dimensional Dirac equation amalgamating the vector-quantum gates duality of Pauli matrices.

QCLA was originally designed for an abstract, concurrent architecture supporting long-distance communication, but most realistic architectures heavily constrain communication distances. The quantum carry-lookahead adder is faster than a quantum ripple-carry adder; QCLA has logarithmic depth while ripple adders have linear depth. MBQCLA utilizes MBQC's ability to transfer quantum states in unit time to accelerate addition. MBQCLA breaks the latency limit of addition circuits in nearest neighbor-only architectures: compared to the Θ(n) limit on circuit depth for linear nearest-neighbor architectures, it can reach Θ(log n) depth. MBQCLA is an order of magnitude faster than a ripple-carry adder when adding registers longer than 100 qubits, but requires a cluster state that is an order of magnitude larger. The cluster state resources can be classified as computation and communication; for the unoptimized form, ≈ 88% of the resources are used for communication. Hand optimization of horizontal communication costs results in a ≈ 12% reduction in spatial resources for the in-place MBQCLA circuit. For comparison, a graph state quantum carry-lookahead adder (GSQCLA) uses only ≈ 9% of the spatial resources of the MBQCLA. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Measurement-based quantum computation; optimization; quantum carry-lookahead adder",,,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT: 18001002","We would like to thank Seth Lloyd, Kohei M.

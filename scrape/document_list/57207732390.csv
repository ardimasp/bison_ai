The music director has been using global trend, i.e. radio top music charts to produce favorite song list. This study will utilize data warehouse and business intelligence for PT ABC's marketing and sales strategy, e.g. to improve its service to customers, to increase number of active users and the duration of streaming per user. OLTP data suggested for the data warehouse is the existing streaming transactions, which will be used to analyze customers' most preferred songs. The proposed method to design the data warehouse is using 9-steps from Kimball. The selected process for the data warehouse is customers' streaming and downloading process, with dimensions of location, time and song, with fact less table of the streaming itself. The result of analysis will be customers' most preferred play list based on several parameters, such as customers' locations, streaming hours or days and genre of songs. © 2018 IEEE.","Business Intelligence; Data Warehouse; Decision Making; OLAP Analysis; Star Schema","Competitive intelligence; Data warehouses; Decision making; Information analysis; Pattern recognition; Digital music; Global trends; ITS Services; Number of active users; OLAP Analysis; Sales strategies; Star schema; Sales",,,,,"Kusek, D., Leonhard, G., (2005) The Future of Music: Manifestofor the Digital Music Revolution; Aguiar, L., Martens, B., Digital music consumption on the Internet: Evidence from clickstream data (2016) Inf.

This, of course, creates intense competition between the malls in showing the performance of each mall, thus requiring system management in any mall decision making that requires increased and more attention in improving the performance of their malls. At present, one of the retail company in Indonesia has had a Main Performance Indicator (KPI) in the assessment of managed malls, however, the criteria and sub criteria required by each mall cannot be determined completely according to what is in each. The weighting for each criterion and sub-criteria that can be used for the entire mall. This study aims to resolve the decision-making problem of Shopping Malls performance by considering main criteria such as Financial, Customer Satisfaction, Growth & Develop Talents, and Internal Process. This research using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The Data is collected through a questionnaire that will be submitted to customers by using a combination of Balanced Scorecard. By referring to the solution provided by the AHP (Analyt ical Hierarchy Process) method in making decisions, a decision maker can make decisions about choosing a mall that has a higher performance based on established criteria. © International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

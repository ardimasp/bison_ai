Ensuring that correct implementation of business process in each service in SOA environment is quite different than monolithic applications, where each service must be tested independently and jointly, depending on targeted testing scope. With numerous proposed approaches for solving such challenge, this paper reviews some of those approaches to ease readers understanding of what can be done in testing in SOA environment. More specifically, this paper provides review on generic proposed approaches, unit testing, and integration testing approaches as part of quality assurance testing on SOA environment. In summary, the details of testing implementation will differ for each enterprise/organization as each has different set of requirements to satisfy. © 2020 IEEE.","Quality Assurance; Review; Service-oriented architecture; Testing","Application programs; Information management; Information services; Integration testing; Quality assurance; Software design; Business Process; Quality assurance testing; Unit testing; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,"Candea, G., Bucur, S., Zamfir, C., Automated software testing as a service (2010) Proceedings of the 1st ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing, pp. 155-160; Clegg, B.S., Rojas, J.M., Fraser, G., Teaching software testing concepts using a mutation testing game (2017) Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering and Education Track, pp. 33-36; Suma, V., Gopalakrishnan Nair, T., Better defect detection and prevention through improved inspection and testing approach in small and medium scale software industry (2010) International Journal of Productivity and Quality Management; Morris, E., Anderson, W., Bala, S., Carney, D., Morley, J., Place, P., Simanta, S., Testing in service-oriented environments (2010) Carnegie Mellon University; Kumar, A., Singh, M., An empirical study on testing of soa based services (2015) I.

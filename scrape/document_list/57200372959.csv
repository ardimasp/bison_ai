Thoserequirements of development can be done by the government, the private sector or by the individual sectors, but it needs to follow the ordinance which is set in the city plan to avoid the adverse negative impact in the future. The problems are if the monitored development in the city is like Jakarta - Indonesia, which have an area of 661 square kilometres compared with the limitation of government employee source. Therefore, it is important to advancing the new tools to monitor the development of the city, due to the large development area and the limitation of source. This research explores the using of Low-altitude UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) combined with photogrammetry techniques - a new rapidly developing technology - to collect as-built building development information in real time, cost-effective and efficient manner. The result of this research explores the possibility of using the UAV in sustainable urban development control and it can detect the anomalies of the development. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","photogrammetry; sustainable urban development control; UAV","Altitude control; Cost effectiveness; Photogrammetry; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Urban growth; Building development; Building spaces; Cost effective; Government employees; Low altitudes; Private sectors; Sustainable urban development; UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle); Aircraft control",,,,,"This research is funded 039A/VR.RTT/VI/2017.","Djimantoro, M.I., Sjarifudin, F.U., (2015) Advance in Civil Engineering and Building Material IV, pp. 467-470. , (CRC Press) Parametric Urban Design: Shaping the Neighbourhood by Optimizing the Urban Density and Road Service Level; Djimantoro, M.I., Smart City Planning System on Settlement Area (2016) 2016 International Conference on ICT for Smart Society, ICISS 2016, p. 74. , (Surabaya,); Nasional, B.S., (2004) SNI03-1733-2004 Tentang Tata Cara Perencanaan Lingkungan Perumahan di Perkotaan, , (Jakarta); Achille, C., Adami, A., Chiarini, S., Cremonesi, S., Fassi, F., Fregonese, L., Taffurelli, L., (2015) UAV-Based Photogrammetry and Integrated Technologies for Architectural Application - Methodological Strategies for the After-Quake Survey of Vertical Structures in Mantua (Italy), 15, pp. 15520-15539; Remondino, F., Barazzetti, L., Nex, F., Scaioni, M., Sarazzi, D., UAV Photogrammetry for Mappping and 3D Modelling - Curent Status and Future Perspectives - Curent S (2011) International Archieves of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Science, 38; Grubesic, T.H., Wallace, D., Chamberlain, A.W., Nelson, J.R., Using unmanned aerial systems for remotely sensing physical disorder in neighborhoods (2018) Landscape and Urban Planning, 169, pp. 148-159; Nex, F., Remondino, F., UAV for 3D mapping apllication: A review (2014) Applied Geomatics, 6 (1), p. 1; Jansen, P., Loh, P., Raonic, A., Schnabel, M.A., Construction site monitoring using UAV oblique photogrammetry and bim technologies (2017) 22nd International Conference of the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia",,"Kasih T.P.","","Institute of Physics Publishing","International Conference on Eco Engineering Development 2017, ICEED 2017","14 November 2017 through 15 November 2017",,133427,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The research applies thephenomenological approach, and data analysis was conducted based on David Rudlin's theory (1999) that includes analysis of urban texture aspect, circulation analysis and analysis of greening. To deepen the analysis, both on residential systems and hydroponic systems, the research is also equipped with insights gained from comparative studies and literature studies. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","hydroponics; Lebak Bulus; townhouse; urban farming; urban green space","Textures; Urban planning; hydroponics; Lebak Bulus; townhouse; urban farming; Urban green spaces; Houses",,,,,"Online: http://jakarta.bisnis.com/read/20171228/77/721758/sandiaga-dorong-program-urban-farming-di-penjuru-jakarta; Online: http://www.fullbloomhydroponics.net/hydroponic-systems-101/#ixzz58flUpyAg; Creswell, J.W., (1998) Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing among Five Traditions; Halim, J., (2016) Enam Teknik Hidroponik; Rudlin, D.F., Falk, N., (1999) Building the 21stcentury Home 2nd Ed.","Ardiani, Y.M.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: millaardiani@binus.ac.id",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Wayang orang-or loosely translated human puppet-is a traditional opera-like performance rooted in Central and East Java, Indonesia. As part of a traditional society living in a rural area, members of the group discuss their productions mostly without written documents. Storylines were experienced through performing and watching different shows. Technical skills were built through lifelong intimate practices. The project explores a general explorative question: how does a traditional oral and aural art group adapt to electronic apparatuses of cinema and create their films? In answering this question, the research uses ethnography or participant observation followed by filmmaking collaborations that involve these artists, the writer and different filmmakers from the industry. The writer positions himself as the producer for the films, supporting and managing the members of the group to explore their own artistic decisions. This paper focuses on one particular production at the early stage of the project. © Ateneo de Manila University.","Collaborative filmmaking; Indigenous media; Javanese performance art",,,,,,"McLuhan, M., Guttenberg Galaxy (1995) Essential Mcluhan, pp. 106-148. , Eric McLuhan and Frank Zingrone.

Whether it was the Catholic Legion of Decency campaigning against certain Hollywood films in the 1930s before the introduction of the Hayes code,1 or the Indonesian Islamic Cleric group (MUI) protesting to the Indonesian Censorship Board,2 religion oft en tends to regard film as hazardous to society. In Indonesia where the version of Islam is relatively moderate, many religious people still consider fi lm spectatorship as sinful. At the same time, cinema has frequently taken religious life or spirituality as a source of inspiration and of significant stories to tell. Spreading the word of God, the most fundamental reason for the existence of religious organization, seems to be in line with the basic nature of cinema. Film industries across the world tackle humanity's relationship with a Divine power, with or without endorsement from religious authorities.3 Moreover, the religious communities provide producers with potential viewers. In newly democratic Indonesia, the country with the largest Muslim population in the world, movies with Islamic themes have been popular since early 2008, when Verses of Love (Ayat-Ayat Cinta), a love story with a Muslim background, became a box office hit. In a country, where the local fi lm production is dominated by teen flicks, cheesy love stories, and horror movies, this success came as a surprise. While in Indonesia even a poorly selling horror film will still sell 300,000 tickets and the best could sell one and a half million,4 Ayat-Ayat Cinta sold a total of four million tickets,5 proving that the local market can occasionally be tapped for unlikely themes. Ayat-Ayat Cinta was not the first film after the 1998 political reform which attempted to represent Muslim life; a digital film called Doomsday is Approaching (Kiamat Sudah Dekat) was released in 2003. However, this movie failed at the box office. This failure might be the reason why it took five years for another film representing Islam to be commercially released. After Ayat-Ayat Cinta broke ticket sales records for local movies, Just Be It (the Arabic term God uses to create) (Kun Fayakuun) followed in April 2008, confi rming the beginning of the new fi lm trend. Two months later Claiming to be a Prophet (Mengaku Rasul) was released, followed by Converting for Love (Syahadat Cinta) in mid-August. Since then, there has been a steady trickle of religious fi lms in Indonesia. At least ten fi lms with Islamic subject matter and titles that translate to A Woman with a Turban (Perempuan Berkalung Sorban, 2009), When Love is Praying (Ketika Cinta Bertasbih, 2009), Mom Wants to Do the Pilgrimage (Emak Ingin Naik Haji, 2009), The Enlightener (Sang Pencerah, 2010) or Khalifah (2010) have been released. While not all of these films did well at the box office, it is safe to say that a new subgenre in Indonesian cinema has emerged. This essay discusses the correlation and struggle between the two motives behind making these types of religious films: on the one hand, the propagation of religion to as wide an audience as possible, and on the other hand the desire to make as much profit as possible. In this essay, I shall limit my discussion of mainstream Islamic cinema to the above five mainstream movies. However, I will start the discussion with an independently-distributed movie, The Teacher/Preserver (Sang Murrabi), that was released on a limited basis in October 2008. While the essay's title might appear provocative by confronting religion and market, I do not want to impose a moral agenda on these fi lms or judge their artistic merits. Another important caveat is that labelling these movies as independent and mainstream respectively in relation to their distribution methods might suggest that the two sides are in clear-cut opposition. Th ey are not, as the producer of Sang Murabbi is considering to release the fi lm theatrically in order to recoup his cost. My interest in this essay is to identify initial motives in each movie: whether it is religious propaganda or whether they were made merely for economic profi t; and then relate these fi ndings to the actual market performance. Th e Muslim majority in Indonesia is a signifi cant potential market; therefore the production of Islamic (or at least Islamic-looking) movies is a potentially profi table endeavour. Moreover, I discuss how these movies succeed in fulfi lling cinema's function as public sphere, where social issues are addressed. Finally, I will discuss the narrative structure of these fi lms vis- A-vis the narrative structure of non-religious mainstream movies. © 2012 Hong Kong University Press.

Prior researches through prior journals both classics journal such as Quesnay (1766) and Solow (1957) and updated journal such as Reikard (2011) researches, are mentioned and elaborated. Precisely, the research is narrowed down and specified into automotive industry and eventually the software related of SPSS and Structural Equation Modeling ( SEM ). The analysis and its method are conducted through the calculation working time. The mentioned calculation are reinforced with the hypothesis test using SPSS Version 19 and involve parameters of production efficiency, productivity calculation, and the calculation of financial investments. The results obtained are augmented achievement of cycle time target < 80 seconds posterior to improvement stand jig sealer. The result from calculation of SPSS-19 version comprise the following aspects :the one-sided hypothesis test is rejection of Ho:μ>80 seconds, the correlation rs=0.84, regression y = 0.159+0.642x, validity R table = 0.4438, reliability value of Cronbach's alpha = 0.885>0.70, independence (Chi Square) Asymp. Sig=0.028<0.05, 95% efficiency, increase productivity 11%, financial analysis (NPV 2,340,596>0, PI 2.04>1, IRR 45.56%>i=12.68%, PP=1.86). The Mentioned calculation results support the hypothesis and ultimately align with the objective of this paper to prove that improvement of Stand Jig Sealer and its relation toward the cycle time target. Precisely, the improvement of production capacity of PT. Astra Daihatsu Motor. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,"Allender, M.C., (1984) Productivity Enhancement: A New Teamwork Approach, , John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY, U.S.A; (2006) Handbook on Green Productivity, , http://www.apo-tokyo.org/gp/e_publi/ebooks_gp/ APO_Handbook_on_Productivity.pdf, Asian Productivity Organization.

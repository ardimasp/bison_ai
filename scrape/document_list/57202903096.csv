Syahdan No. 9, Kemanggisan, Palmerah, Jakarta, 11480, Indonesia","Recent developments of portable sensor devices, cloud computing, and machine learning algorithms have led to the emergence of big data analytics in healthcare. The condition of the human body, e.g. the ECG signal, can be monitored regularly by means of a portable sensor device. The use of the machine learning algorithm would then provide an overview of a patient’s current health on a regular basis compared to a medical doctor’s diagnosis that can only be made during a hospital visit. This work aimed to develop an accurate model for classifying sleep stages by features of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) extracted from Electrocardiogram (ECG). The sleep stages classification can be utilized to predict the sleep stages proportion. Where sleep stages proportion information can provide an insight of human sleep quality. The integration of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was utilized for selecting features and determining the number of hidden nodes. The results were compared to Support Vector Machine (SVM) and ELM methods which are lower than the integration of ELM with PSO. The results of accuracy tests for the combined ELM and PSO were 62.66%, 71.52%, 76.77%, and 82.1% respectively for 6, 4, 3, and 2 classes. To sum up, the classification accuracy can be improved by deploying PSO algorithm for feature selection. © 2021, The Author(s).","Electrocardiogram; Extreme learning machine; Heart rate variability; Particle swarm optimization; Sleep stages",,,,,"039/VR","This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Prototipe dan Aplikasi Monitoring Kualitas Tidur Portabel berbasis Teknologi Cloud Computing dan Machine Learning” or “Portable Sleep Quality Monitoring Prototype and Application based on Cloud Computing Technology and Machine Learning” with contract number: 039/VR.RTT/IV/2019 and contract date: 29 April 2019.","Hirshkowitz, M., National Sleep Foundation 2013 poll (2013) Sleep Heal; Tibbitts, G.M., Sleep disorders: causes, effects, and solutions (2008) Prim Care Clin Off Pract, 35, pp. 817-837; Kales, A., Rechtschaffen, A., (1968) A manual of standardized terminology, techniques and scoring system for sleep stages of human subjects, , U.

Sleep disorder may increase the risk of developing chronic physical and mental illnesses such as heart failure, coronary heart disease, depression, and bipolar disorder. In addition, sleep disorder also decreases work productivity and increases the risk of traffic accidents. The problem of sleep disorder is usually associated with the irregularity in sleep cycles. People need to get the right proportion of every stages and sufficient number of cycles to obtain a quality sleep. The aim of this study is to examine distinctive features related to sleep stages (wake, light sleep, deep sleep) from heart rate variability (HRV), and evaluate their usefulness to classify sleep stages. We utilize support vector machine (SVM) to classify the sleep stages classification and compare the result with conventional methods. We also utilize particle swarm optimization (PSO) for feature selection. The simulation results show that our proposed sleep classification with SVM and PSO can improve the accuracy of sleep stage classification. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Cardiology; Diseases; Heart; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machines; Bipolar disorder; Conventional methods; Coronary heart disease; Heart rate variability; Number of cycles; Sleep disorders; Sleep stages classifications; Work productivity; Sleep research",,,,,,"Moorcroft, W.H., Belcher, P., (2003) Understanding Sleep and Dreaming, , Springer; Beecroft, J.M., Ward, M., Younes, M., Crombach, S., Smith, O., Hanly, P.J., Sleep monitoring in the intensive care unit: Comparison of nurse assessment, actigraphy and polysomnography (2008) Intensive Care Med., 34 (11), p. 20762083; Surantha, N., Kusuma, G.P., Isa, S.M., Internet of things for sleep quality monitoring system: A survey (2016) Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems (KICSS), 2016 11th International Conference on, p. 16; Werteni, H., Yacoub, S., Ellouze, N., An automatic sleep-wake classifier using ECG signals (2014) Int.

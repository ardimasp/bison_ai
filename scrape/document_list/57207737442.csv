This study aims to determine the factors that affect the user in using m-commerce to buy online using UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) and TAM (Technology Acceptance Model). Constructs from the previous study are used such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating condition but also added perceived trust and perceived cost. Data obtained from 156 respondents were analyzed using PLS (Partial Least Squares). The analysis showed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and perceived trust significantly influences the use of m-commerce while facilitating condition and perceived cost have no significant effect on the use of m-commerce. © 2018 IEEE.","m-commerce; mobile commerce; TAM; Technology Acceptance Model; Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology; UTAUT","Cost benefit analysis; Economic and social effects; Least squares approximations; Pattern recognition; Facilitating conditions; M-commerce; Partial least square (PLS); Perceived trusts; Technology acceptance model; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; UTAUT; Mobile commerce",,,,,"(2016) Penetrasi Dan Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia, , APJII, Jakarta; (2014) Profil Pengguna Internet Indonesia 2014, , Asosiasi Penyelenggara Jasa Internet Indonesia and Puskakom UI, Pertama, M.

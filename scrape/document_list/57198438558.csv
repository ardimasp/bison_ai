The recent economic crisis is known to have had a great impact on consumer behavior with regard to restaurants. Therefore, this study is primarily focused on exploring the effects on the traditional antecedents of satisfaction and revisit intentions as full-time restaurants attempt to come up with better marketing strategies. This study involved 150 respondents who recently visited a full-service restaurant within the period of one month prior to the data collection. A confirmatory factor analysis and a reliability analysis were used to test the reliability and validity of the measurements. The hypotheses testing was conducted using a simple and multiple linear regression analysis to test the suitability of the proposed model for measuring satisfaction and revisit intentions. The results of the study showed that atmosphere has a significant influence on customer satisfaction and revisit intention. Customer satisfaction was also found as one of the most significant factors impacting revisit intention in the full-service restaurant industry. Therefore, restaurant managers can use a combination of good price and exciting atmosphere to enhance satisfaction and revisit intention. This study provides insights on full-service restaurants in Indonesia which have not received much attention in both marketing and hospitality literature. © 2020, IGI Global.","Customer Satisfaction; Full-Service Restaurant; Revisit Intention; Service Marketing; Service Quality",,,,,,,"Al-Tit, A.A., The effect of service and food quality on customer satisfaction and hence customer retention (2015) Asian Social Science, 11 (23), pp. 129-139; Baker, J., Grewal, D., Parasuraman, A., The influence of store environment on quality inferences and store image (1994) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 22 (4), pp. 328-339; Barrows, C., Food and beverage management (2008) The SAGE Handbook of Hospitality Management, , Sage; Bei, L.T., Chiao, Y.C., An integrated model for the effects of perceived product, perceived service quality, and perceived price fairness on consumer satisfaction and loyalty (2001) Journal of Consumer Satisfaction, Dissatisfaction & Complaining Behavior, 14, pp. 125-140; Bojanic, D.C., Consumer perceptions on price, value and satisfaction in the hotel industry: An exploratory study (1996) Journal of Hospitality & Leisure Marketing, 4 (1), pp. 5-22; Bowen, D.E., Schneider, B., Boundary-spanning-role employees and the service encounter: Some guidelines for management and research (1985) The Service Encounter, pp. 127-147. , In J.A.

The number of online websites that provide services for the hospitality industry is on the rise. Previous studies have focused more on luxury hotels and there is a lack of study to show the perception of guests regarding budget hotels' websites. Therefore the objective of this study is to analyze the connection between a website quality (usability and ease of use) towards online booking with the e-Trust variable on ZEN Rooms. Data were collected through self-administered questionnaires that were distributed using social media and mobile chatting application. The collected data was analyzed with the Multiple Linear Regression method and some descriptive analysis. The findings of the research state that the ease of use variable has a significant impact on online booking intention, same as the e-Trust variable. The result also showed e-Trust could highly be explained by the ease of use of the website and also the usability of a website. Result also depicted there was no significant difference between genders in terms of e-Trust in using websites. A major contribution of this study is its implications for practitioners in the hospitality industry for developing marketing strategies. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Budget hotel; E-Trust; Online booking; Website quality; ZEN Rooms",,,,,,"The authors wish to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika journal team that help publish this article.","(2015) Alasan mengapa berbelanja di situs e-commerce lebih hemat [The reason why shopping on e-commerce sites is more efficient], , https://news.detik.com/adv-nhl-detikcom/d-3057321/alasan-mengapa-berbelanja-di-situs-ecommerce-lebih-hemat, Advertorial.

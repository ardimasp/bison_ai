PT. “X” is a company engaged in plastic waste processing. It converts the waste into a floor carpet. The purpose of this study was to determine the number of sigma levels generated by PT. “X” in producing Floor covering, what caused the defects and how to reduce defective products using Six Sigma methods based on DMAIC step. Data for the study was collected from interviews and production statistics. The results showed the level of product quality was sigma 3.67, which is an average industry standard for Indonesia. Further, it was found that man (worker) is the major factor for occurrence of defective products. Therefore, a new employment policy at PT. “X” is needed. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Defective products; DMAIC; Quality control; Six Sigma",,,,,,"Basu, R., (2009) Implementing Six Sigma and Lean: A Practical Guide to Tools and Techniques, , Oxford: Elsevier; Goh, T.N., Six triumphs and six tragedies of six sigma (2010) Quality Engineering, 22 (4), pp. 299-305; Hadidi, L.A., Bubshait, A.A., Khreishi, S., Six-sigma for improving aesthetic defects in aluminium profiles facility (2017) Facilities, 35 (3-4), pp. 242-267; Heizer, J., Render, B., Munson, C., (2016) Operations Management: Sustainability and Supply Chain Management, , 12th ed.).

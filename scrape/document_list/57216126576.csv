Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus plantarum IS-10506 were used as mixed starter cultures, incubated at 43°C for 8 hours, with or without the addition of dextrose. The total viable counts of LAB and pH value were assessed. Each combination of starter cultures showed significant increased on the viable counts of LAB, and decreased the pH value of fermented milk during 8 hours incubation. Addition of 2% dextrose tended to increase viable counts of LAB by 165.8 % of milk fermented with mixed starter cultures of S. thermophilus and L. plantarum IS-10506, extending log phase from 6 to 8 hours, while without 2 % dextrose tended to decreased by 40 %. No significant effect of addition of 2% dextrose on viable counts of yogurt starters in yogurt. Mixed starter cultures of S. thermophilus and L. plantarum IS-10506 is potential starter cultures of fermented milk with addition of 2 % dextrose at 43°C for 8 hours incubation time to produce probiotic based functional drink. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","dextrose; fermented milk; mixed cultures; pH value; viable counts of LAB","Bacilli; Dextrose; Food processing; Laboratories; Lactic acid; pH effects; Probiotics; Lactic acid bacteria; Lactobacillus bulgaricus; Lactobacillus plantarum; Mixed cultures; Mixed starter cultures; pH value; Streptococcus thermophilus; Viable count; Fermented milk",,,,,"The authors would like to convey gratitude to PT Ultrajaya Milk Industry & Trading Company, Tbk for funding this research.","Abe, F., (2010) Selection Criteria of Probiotics for Use in Food Products; (2000) Official Methods of Analysis of AOAC International, , AOAC; Buchana, R.E., Gibbsons, N.E., (1974) Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology; (2009) SNI 7388: 2009 the Maximum Limit of Microbial Contamination, , Badan Standardisasi Nasional [BSN]; (1975) Codex STAN A-11(a)-1975 Codex Standar for Yoghurt (Yogurt) and Sweetened Yoghurt (Sweetened Yogurt), , Codex Alimentarius Commision [CAC]; Collado, M.C., Surono, I.S., Meriluoto, J., Salminen, S., Indigenous Dadih lactic acid Bacteria: Cell-surface properties and their interactions with pathogens (2007) J Food Science, 72 (3), pp. M89-M93; (2002) Report of A Joint FAO/WHO Working Group on Drafting Guidelines for the Evaluation of Probiotics in Food, , Food and Agricultural Organization/World Health Organization [FAO/WHO]; Lee, W.J., Lucey, J.A., Formation and physical properties of yogurt (2010) J Anim Sci, 23, pp. 1127-1136; Sunarlim, R., Setiyanto, H., Poeloengan, M., (2007) Proceedings of the National Seminar on Animal Husbandary and Veterinary Technology., pp. 270-278; Surono, I.S., In vitro Probiotic properties of indigenous dadih lactic acid bacteria.

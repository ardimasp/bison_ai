The development of wearables and its sensor enables the possibility of easy-to-use real-time monitoring. The goal of this study is to improve an IoT monitoring system by enabling real-time heart rate monitoring and analysis, also to assess the use of PPG sensors in smart wearables compared to other clinical-tested heart rate sensors. The PPG sensor will be used to record heart rate data of the user physically. The measurements are then sent to the application for pre-processing. The application can then transmit the pre-processed measurements to the cloud server for monitoring or further analysis, i.e. to assess the health of users' heart. The measurement comparison with measurement collected by a BCG sensor is carried out in this paper. While neither are standard for heart rate measurements, the findings of the evaluation show that the PPG sensor achieves quite similar input data and assessment results during awake stages. The Fitbit sensor tested often underestimates, with sometimes delayed or doesn't detect a sudden increase in heart rate during sleeping. © 2020, Science and Information Organization.","Heart rate; Internet-of-things; Real-time monitoring; Smart wearables",,,,,,"This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research and Technology, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Dasar Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled ""Sistem dan Aplikasi Portabel Pendeteksi Gangguan Irama Jantung Menggunakan Sinyal ECG Berbasis Machine Learning dan Cloud Computing"" or ""Portable ECG-based Heart Arrhythmia Prediction System and Application using Machine Learning and Cloud Computing.

Vehicle plate detection by a camera that mounted on parking gate. Detection process starts with collecting data using the camera. This work consists two important parts, namely image processing and classification system, respectively. In the image processing, the plate image capture by the camera is extracted to the feature space which will use as the input to the classification system. The classification system is then will identify the extracted input to the plat recognition identification. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are applied as feature extraction technique and classification methods, respectively. The results of the training and testing phase are 80% and 66%, respectively. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Fast Fourier Transform (FFT); Plate number; Support Vector Machines (SVMs)","Cameras; Commercial vehicles; Fast Fourier transforms; License plates (automobile); Optical character recognition; Principal component analysis; Support vector machines; Classification methods; Classification system; Feature extraction techniques; Government vehicles; License plate recognition systems; Multi-class support vector machines; Support vector machine (SVMs); Training and testing; Image processing",,,,,"(2012) Peraturan Pemerintah Republik Indonesia Nomor 55 Tahun 2012 Tentang Kendaraan, , President Republik Indonesia; (2012) Peraturan Kepala Kepolisian Negara Republik Indonesia, , K.K.N.R.

Despite its high accuracy, the model was not practical when high computing power was not available. Thus, deep model with not-so-deep structure or less number of model parameters is needed for low capacity computer. Logo and brand recognition task is an important and challenging problem in computer vision with wide potential applications. The inherent challenge to address this task is not only due to the presence of logo in various direction and clutters as well as imbalanced dataset but also because of high computing workload when deep learning models were adopted. This paper presents empirical results of logo recognition method using MiniVGGNet and MiniGoogleNet models combined with augmentation technique to increase variation and number of samples. The results show that the proposed model combined with augmentation technique increased accuracy of model accuracies and fasten training convergence of both models. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Augmentation technique; Logo detection; MiniGoogLeNet; MiniVGGNet","Database systems; Marketing; Augmentation techniques; Brand recognition; Computing workloads; Imbalanced dataset; Logo detections; MiniGoogLeNet; MiniVGGNet; Number of samples; Deep learning",,,,,"Acknowledgment.

In order to supports a company with best excellent software applications then we need to make sure the quality of software application in term of easy to maintenance, understandability, reusability and so on. In term to measure the quality of software, there are many software metrics applications either free or proprietary which can be downloaded on Internet and one of them is PHP depend. PHP depend is software metrics which measure the quality of software based on PHP source code, by taking the PHP source code and parses it into Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This paper will investigate how to measure quality of software based on PHP source code with PHP depend software metrics. The investigation will examine codes from Request online system application which supports improvement or update request upon SAP application in Astra Graphia Information Technology PT. The measurement will be assessed based on metrics which is categorized into project, package, file, class and methods. © 2017 IEEE.","Object oriented metrics; PHP metrics; Software measurement.; Software metrics; Software quality","Application programs; Codes (symbols); Computer programming languages; Computer software; Computer software reusability; Computer software selection and evaluation; Reusability; Software engineering; Trees (mathematics); Websites; Object oriented metrics; PHP metrics; Software Measurement; Software metrics; Software Quality; Object oriented programming",,,,,,"Kour, G., Laws, A., (2016) S.

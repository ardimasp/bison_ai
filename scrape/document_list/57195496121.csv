To overcome this issue, President Joko Widodo provides his direction and commitment to the development of human capital in Indonesia (World Economic Forum, 2015). This research examines whether Indonesian listed companies in the financial industry follows President’s direction to focus on human capital. The financial industry is used as a research sample due to its exemplary disclosure practices in Indonesia. Furthermore, this research employs the Indonesian intellectual capital disclosures framework developed by Mulyadi et al. (2017) to analyse IC disclosures in the industry. This framework consists of the working environment, intangible assets, and customer relations. Working environment largely consists of human capital, and this research reveals that working environment was the most disclosed IC category in Indonesian financial industry in 2015.

Considering its importance, many researches have focused on how corporations report its intellectual capital information. This research analyses intellectual capital reporting of Indonesian corporations. Indonesia is chosen as our research object as it is a developing country with the economy focused on low reliance on intellectual capital. To control this context of low reliance on intellectual capital economy, we chose two industries that are known to have a high reliance on intellectual capital. This research provides an answer as to whether corporations in a low intellectual capital country report their intellectual capital information. Our research documents that Indonesian corporations in the finance and pharmaceutical industry are aware of the importance of intellectual capital, and variations of this disclosure exist within industry.

Despite the importance of intellectual capital, several researchers emphasise the limitation of such studies in non-developed countries. Furthermore, the majority of prior studies on intellectual capital disclosures employ content analysis despite its weaknesses. Therefore, this research constructed an Indonesian intellectual capital disclosure framework, a framework based on data of Indonesia that may overcome content analysis weaknesses. Furthermore, this research also offers a new joint theoretical framework, intellectual capital theoretical framework, which may be useful for future intellectual capital disclosure research. This research contributes to limited intellectual capital disclosure research in Indonesia and provides valuable insights into the practice in Indonesia. This research also contributes to the development and introduction of intellectual capital theoretical framework and Indonesian intellectual capital disclosure framework.

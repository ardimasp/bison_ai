This study aims to examine work engagement holistically and attempts to find out the impactful antecedents of work engagement in multiple layer perspectives of organizational behaviour. The main concern of this research is to answer the following question, “does coping stress of the millennials, digital leadership of the direct supervisor, and learning culture in a business organization have positive impact significantly on work engagement?”. The study was involved 317 millennials from three big business organisations in Indonesia. The study results conclude that work engagement of millennial in Indonesia can be defined holistically by considering physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual dimensions. Engaging the millennials to work at the office can be improved by developing millennials’ capability in coping stress, supervisor’s capability in leading digitally, and enabling learning culture as corporate culture in the business organization. © 2020, Czestochowa University of Technology.

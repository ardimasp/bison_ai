For the reason, a number of studies has been performed on the basis of English, German, Mandarin, Persian, and Danish languages. This work intends to develop automatic emotion recognition system on the basis of speech signal in Indonesia language. The study is limited to four emotional states, namely, happy, sad, angry, and fear. The speech data are collected from amateur actors and actresses, and are further quantified using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient to provide 48 emotion-related features. Finally, these features are used for emotion classification using Support Vector Machine method.

A number of studies are undertaken on the basis of normal speech. This research intends to develop automatic voiceprint recognition system on the basis of emotion speech signal in Indonesia language. The study is limited to four different people with speeches of four distinctive emotional conditions, i.e. happy, sad, angry, and fear. The 48 voiceprint features from emotion-related speeches data are extracted by applying Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient, speaker classification utilized these features. The categorization is also bolstered by Support Vector Machine method.

It becomes much more important because human thinking process and behavior are strongly influenced by the emotion. Align with these needs, an expert system that capable of predicting the emotion state would be useful for many practical applications. Based on a speech signal, the system has been widely developed for various languages. This study intends to evaluate to which extent Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features, besides Teager energy feature, derived from Indonesian speech signal relates to four emotional types: happy, sad, angry, and fear. The study utilizes empirical data of nearly 300 speech signals collected from four amateur actors and actresses speaking 15 prescribed Indonesian sentences. Using support vector machine classifier, the empirical findings suggest that the Teager energy, as well as the first coefficient of MFCCs, are a crucial feature and the prediction can achieve the accuracy level of 86%. The accuracy increases quickly with a few initial MFCC features. The fourth and more features have negligible effects on the accuracy. © 2017 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Indonesia speech; Mel frequency cepstral coefficient; Support vector machine; Teager energy",,,,,,"Frieda, K.K.N., (1993) Moods, Emotion Episodes, and Emotions, , Guilford Press, New York; Chibelushi, C., Bourel, F., (2015) Facial expression recognition: A brief tutorial overview, , http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/CHIBELUSHI1/CCC_FB_FacExprRecCVonline.pdf, retrieved on January (January 2003); Gladwell, P.O.M., (2008) The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes\Captain the Weather Radar Has Helped Us a Lot, , In Success, Outliers: The Story of Success, Little, Brown and Company, New York, United States of America; Galla, T.M., Sapra, A., Panwar, N., Panwar, S., Emotion Recognition from Speech (2013) International Journal of Emerging Technology and advanced engineering, 3 (2), pp. 341-345; Sathe-Pathak, B.V., Panat, A.R., Extraction of Pitch and Formants and its Analysis to Identify Three Different Emotional States of a Person (2012) International Journal of Computer Science, 9 (4), pp. 296-299; Pao, T.L., Chen, Y., Yeh, J.H., Lu, J., Detecting Emotions in Mandarin Speech (2004) ROCLING, pp. 365-373; Kandali, A.B., Routray, A., Basu, T.K., Emotion Recognition from Assamese Speeches using MFCC Features and GMM classifie (2008) TENCON 2008-2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference, IEEE, pp. 1-5; Hamidi, M., Mansoorizade, M., Emotion Recognition from Persian Speech with Neural Network (2012) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence & Applications, 3 (5), p. 107; Lin, Y.L., Wei, G., Speech Emotion Recognition based on HMM and SVM, in: Machine Learning and Cybernetics (2005) Proceedings of 2005 International Conference on.

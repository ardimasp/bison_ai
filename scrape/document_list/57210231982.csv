Current IT system is dominated with independent applications that make difficult to monitor and control the data. Jakarta government has taken IT initiative to optimize the potential of regional income and encourage the taxpayer compliance in fulfilling the obligation of payment of local taxes as well as the creation of integration of revenue collection amongst all related units. Jakarta governor has encouraged the use of recent IT technology to support faster data retrieval and effective decision-making process. The article proposes the conceptual SOA framework and supported with web GIS and Big Data application to promote data exchange amongst all units. The use of SOA is expected to deliver reliable services, module reusability, scalability and interoperability. The outcome of the article is expected to be used as a reference for all province in Indonesia in integrating data that spread in all districts/sub-districts and task-forces, and promote better decision making. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Big data; Decision making; Electronic data interchange; Electronic document exchange; Interoperability; Reusability; Big data applications; Data retrieval; Decision making process; It technologies; Local taxes; Monitor and control; Task force; Tax incomes; Taxation",,,,,"Yong, O.K., Towards ASEAN Financial Integration.

The open collaborative platform focused on the nature of the Web 2.0 era which is using associated tool for education technology, participation of students, and interactive approach. Higher education institution is challenged to become more creative to create an interactive learning platform. One of the trending solutions is used social learning platform, which combines learning technology with the social me- dia environment. Social learning as learning method combines multiple media that are designed to complement the learning platform. The purpose of this study is to identify how social media could implement as an interactive tool to support blended learning in a higher education institution. The methodology of this study using design science re- search to identify the appropriate social learning system model which consists of seven stages: design as an artifact, problem relevance, design evaluation, research contribution, research rigor, design as a search process, and communication of research. The result of this study provides a social learning systems application as a tool for higher education institutions to increase learning experience in terms of participation and collaborative learning.

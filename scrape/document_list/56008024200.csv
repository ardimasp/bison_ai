The increasing use of e-commerce today makes us wonder what kind of e-commerce model can satisfy customers. How about the trust of the business investors' view? Business investors are more likely cautious in making decisions. The managerial level in the Company also has a significant impact on e-commerce strategy. What trust factors influence customers' purchase intentions? This research was conducted to find a correlation between Trust and Loyalty in e-commerce with Purchase Intention. It is therefore known that the factors trust, and loyalty affect the increase in customers' Intention to buy. This research used Sequential Equation Modelling (SEM) to calculate the 107 data set of business investors as respondents at a business exhibition in Jakarta. Respondents were chosen using the Purposive Sampling Method. Data were analyzed model building by using Smart PLS 3.0. This research aims to know the impact of Trust to Purchase Intention of business investors as e-commerce users, to see the opportunity to sell the business to business investors. The result found that Trust to Purchase had a significant impact on Purchase Intention and found four indicators not valid nor reliable. © 2020 IEEE.","Business investors; Customer behavior; E-commerce; Purchase intention; Trust","Behavioral research; Customer satisfaction; Electronic commerce; Information management; Purchasing; Business to business; E-commerce model; E-commerce strategy; Intention to buies; Making decision; Purchase intention; Sampling method; Trust factor; Sales",,,,,,"Mattison, F., Tuzovic, S., Braun, C., Trustmarks: Strategies for exploiting their full potential in e-commerce (2018) Bus.

This study aims to determine whether these variables: E-payment System, Impulsive Purchase, Trust, and Behavior Control affect Purchase Intention in E-commerce. The method used in this research is Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) with purposive sampling for data collecting. Data sample will be taken from Indonesia E-commerce users who mostly used E-Payment Systems. In this preliminary research, the data was taken in May 2020 from 51 respondents. Model building is supported by some previous research and the Theory of Planned Behavior from Ajzen[13].

So, purchase or purchase intention has become an indicator of e-commerce performance. Previous research showed that there are several factors that can influence the level of purchase intention in e-commerce. This preliminary research used Sequential Equation Modeling (SEM). Data of 51 respondents was collected in May 2020 using Purposive sampling with respondents who are e-commerce buyers in Jabodetabek region in Indonesia. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of Perceived of Ease, Perceived of Risk, Transaction Attitude, Visual Merchandising, and Trust to Company on Purchase Intention in the e-commerce of active e-commerce users. Transaction Attitude and Visual Merchandising will become special variables which affect the Purchase Intention directly or indirectly. The result found that there are two hypotheses that are not significant: Perceived of Ease to Transaction Attitude and Trust to Company to Transaction Attitude.

As the number increases, breast cancer which contributes most to the number become major attention. Breast cancer detection can be done using many methods but their main purpose are all same. Considering the current situation, Machine Learning (ML) application to support cancer detection have the ability to provide better diagnostic result as in 97.40/0 of the cases without ML participation, malignancy was to be found on surgery while 30.6% surgeries conducted on benign lesion can be prevented. This paper propose an early detection model for breast cancer which will combine models from previous researches to become functional for many detection methods. Methods that had been proven to show accuracy in their specific field and suggested to be used in parallel: DWT-based multi-resolution MRF (MMRF) segmentation for mammography, MLP for histologic examination, and k-NN-SVMRFE method for gene identification which will be effective by learning from experience of at least 450 datasets of positive breast cancer result for each method and refers to Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnosis (WBDC). The research itself will be conducted from October 2018 until March 2019 and the final result will be applied to conduct further research in ML application in breast cancer early detection. © 2018 IEEE.","artificial intelligent; breast cancer; machine learning; Wisconsin breast cancer diagnosis","Artificial intelligence; Diagnosis; Information management; Learning systems; Magnetorheological fluids; Nearest neighbor search; Surgery; Artificial intelligent; Breast Cancer; Breast cancer detection; Breast cancer diagnosis; Current situation; Gene identification; Learning from experiences; Medical management; Diseases",,,,,"Shanghai 200030, China for her contribution.","(2018) Merriam-Webster Dictionary Cancer Springfield Merriam-Webster Dictionary, , in press; Roser, M., Ritchie, H., (2018) Cancer Oxford: Our World in Data, , in press; Cancer Organization, B., Breast cancer treatment causes severe side effects in many woman (2017) Ardmore: Breast Cancer Organization, , February in press; Anderson, B.O., Guideline implementation for breast healthcare in low-income and middle-income countries: Overview of the Breast Health Global Initiative Global Summit 2007 (2008) Cancer, 113, pp. 2221-2243; Wang, L., Early diagnosis of breast cancer (2017) J.

On the other side, the investor is an individual or an institution who is able to choose other franchise business in same industry such as culinary sector and also has his certain agenda. By finding factors that determine the increase of intention to purchase franchise business through online marketing, the result are used to build ERHA Model which was proved for education and culinary industry. This research is proved for culinary industry. The research method used in this study was structural equation modelling (SEM) using LISREL application. Model building is based on Theory of Planned Behavior and DeLone and McLean model for information system. The objective is to build a model so-called as ERHA model. The results show the ERHA model variables components, such as: Franchise Advantages and Subjective Norm variables give significant positive impact to Trust to Franchisor.

In Indonesia, many problems regarding the management and preservation of medical record is still a concern while existing medical records are still present separately depending on the medical institution. On the other hand, Indonesian people are known to constantly switch doctors and thus making their medical history scattered amongst medical institutions. Many research studies in medical field for disease management cannot be done because of insufficient knowledge which actually can be resolved by KM. The main problems of this study are the inexistence of a complete life-long medical history documentation of the patients and the unavailability of medical records for mass utilization for health research institutions. Therefore, knowledge management system is needed to manage the medical record knowledge in different medical institutions across Indonesia and to gather all medical records of each person in order to form a more complete life-long medical history utilization for health institutions. This study is a proposal of a research which objectives are: to propose mass utilization of medical record information system and to propose interconnected access for a patient medical record between health institution across Indonesia by developing a knowledge management system which will be useful for future treatment and management of patient with similar condition and for medical research complete source of past, current, and possible future health condition.

Through this, it expects to determine which variables were more influential to intellectual capital and financial performance using secondary, time series, and panel data. Based on Canonical analysis results, the dominant influence on the financial performance of intellectual capital rather than vice versa. Granger causality analysis results indicate that all the variables of intellectual capital and financial performance can be mutually influential. Not all variables have a significant influence one with another. The variables that have significant influence among one another is HCE to ROA, ROE to SCE, and ROA to ROE (not vice versa). It shows that for the case of Indonesian, insurance company's financial performance has more dominant effect than intellectual capital.","Canonical Model; Financial Performance; Granger Causality Model; Human Capital Efficiency; Intellectual Capital; Physical Employed Efficiency; Structural Capital Efficiency",,,,,,"Bollen, L., Vergauwen, P., Schnieders, S., Linking intellectual capital and intellectual property to company performance (2005) Management Decision, 43 (9), pp. 1161-1185; Chen, M.C., Cheng, S.J., Hwang, Y., An empirical investigation of the relationship between intellectual capital and firms market value and financial performance (2005) Journal of Intellectual Capital, 6 (2), pp. 159-176; Dae-Bong, K., (2009) Human Capital and Its Measurement, , The 3rd OECD World Forum on Statistics, Knowledge and Policy; El-Bannany, M., Global financial crisis and the intellectual capital performance of UAE banks (2012) Journal of Human Resource Costing, & Accounting, 16 (1), pp. 20-36; Lu, X., Su, L., White, H., (2011) Granger Causality and Structural Causality in Crosssection and Panel Data 2014, , Whites Econometric Theory Lectures at the 7th Symposium on Econometric Theory and Application (SETA; Marko, G., Human capital and knowledge audit as the competitive advantage of companies (2013) Net Journal of Social Sciences, 1 (1), pp. 1-4; Micah, L.C., Ofurum, C.O., Ihendinihu, J.U., Firms Financial Performance and Human Resource Accounting Disclosure in Nigeria (2012) International Journal of Business and Management, 7 (14), pp. 67-75; Mondal, A., Ghosh, S.K., Intellectual capital and financial, performance of Indian banks (2012) Journal of Intellectual Capital, 13 (4), pp. 515-530; Pulic, A., (2008) The Principles of Intellectual Capital Efficiency, , http://www.cik-hr.com/data/principles_2008.pdf, A Brief Description.

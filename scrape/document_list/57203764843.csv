The high population of Jakarta increases the number of vehicles operating on the streets and causes congestion that leads to a loss of 67.5 trillion rupiah. The development of adequate public transport facilities is expected to be one of the solution, such as TransJakarta which has flat and low price. The bus fleets of TransJakarta are also equipped with air-conditioning. However, the level of public transport users is still quite low because the use of public transport is considered ineffective as it usually cost longer time to reach a destination. Based on the factors, the authors are encouraged to develop an Android-based application, ""TransTrip"", to provide clear information about the shortest path using Dijkstra algorithm and the type of public transportation that can be used to reach a destination, form a source location, with TransJakarta as the main transport and other public transport such as Angkot and Metromini to complete the routes. Notification to stop and transit features are included in TransTrip to answer the current needs of the community. © 2018 Rini Wongso, Cin Cin, Suhartono and Joseph.","Dijkstra; Public transportation; Shortest path; Trans Trip; TransJakarta",,,,,"Binus University","This research is supported by Science, Bina Nusantara University.","Elizabeth, M., Gani, B., Safitri, M.A., Dewi, L.C., Meiliana, (2017) Real time public transportation navigator system in Jakarta by using greedy best first search algorithm, , ICOCOE; Gupta, N., Mangla, K., Jha, A.K., Applying Dijkstra ' s algorithm in routing process (2016) Int.

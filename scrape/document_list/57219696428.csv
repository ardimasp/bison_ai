However, each student has different performance and development, therefore it is important to do monitoring so that student performance will always be monitored by the school for improving student quality maintenance. Also, in the process of valuing education for students needs to be done by giving an appreciation in the form of giving gifts or just giving words and motivation so that students can perform better in learning and participating in other activities at school. In terms of selecting students with good performance or those who have a very declining development using the school method not only assess students by one criterion but with several criteria to produce a decision that can be accepted by many people. Performance Students must also be monitored by the school or the related rights. In this paper, the student performance prediction was assessed with 5 criteria components and the result shows there are 10 very satisfy students, 10 satisfying students, 10 well students, and 10 Enough students from sample 40 students. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

As the increase in patients confirmed positive, the government continues to appeal and ask the Indonesian to use masks. Whether it is a healthy people or those who are sick. This appeal is in line with the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Therefore it is necessary to develop tools for monitor people who have not used masks in public service areas in real-time. We develop an application of mask detection using a camera that functions as photo and video input and connected to Speed Maix Bit microprocessor to process data and display it to the LCD. We purposed the tools to solve the problems regarding people who were not used masks or not immediately to minimize the spread of COVID-19. Our final experiment demonstrates that the application highly detects people using masks or not in the public area. This study contributed to the conception, design system, and rules-based for application of mask detector to prevent Covid-19. © 2020 Published under licenceby IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Physics; Coronaviruses; Design systems; Healthy people; Process data; Public areas; Public services; Rules based; World Health Organization; Liquid crystal displays",,,,,,,,"Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., Li, X., Yang, B., Song, J., Niu, P., 2020 A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China 2019 New England Journal of Medicine; Xu, Z., Shi, L., Wang, Y., Zhang, J., Huang, L., Zhang, C., Tai, Y., Pathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (2020) The Lancet respiratory medicine, 8, pp. 420-422; Adhikari, S.

Testing vehicles in the process requires time efficiency and accurate service output to decide whether the vehicle is roadworthy or not. In this study, the application of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is considered more appropriate in solving existing problems by weighting the criteria of technical testing and administrative testing, where there are four criterias are used such as the identity of the owner / authorized, application letter, type test registration certificate and vehicle license. The results of this study are web-based applications that regulate the hierarchy starting from the beginning of the registration process, testing, ratification of service outputs and various kinds of reporting so that the supervisor as the main person responsible for ensuring the safety of the tested vehicle can be faster, more precise and comprehensive in making the decision. © 2020 ©2006-2020 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

If parking areas can take more space in a town/place, it will be good for the town itself because nowadays the problem is either no parking space or too much parking space which is not suitable for human space. Moreover, because our population keeps going up and space is reducing even, we have to cut the forest to make space for parking lots, which is not suitable for our ecosystem. The number of cars itself also increasing each year, which is so problematic in road and infrastructure management. To fix this, we need to have a sound management system for maximizing the use of available space in town and minimizing the traffic in the road. The problem nowadays is a roaming car that searching for parking space and making road traffic and making massive pollution for the town. When a car searching for a parking slot inside a building that is crowded, it will go around the parking lot, and there will be traffic inside the parking lot because many cars will queue searching for empty parking slots. This means that the driver will also waste many fuels, which is not suitable for the ecosystem. Since this problem has not been fixed yet and the population is increasing each year, and a new way of driving and parking system is required, we want to propose a new system that uses the processor board, wireless sensor network to fix the problem. © 2020 IEEE.","architecture; Car Parking System; Smart system; Wireless Sensor","Computer architecture; Ecosystems; Highway administration; Highway planning; Roads and streets; Infrastructure managements; Parking areas; Parking lots; Parking spaces; Parking systems; Processor boards; Road traffic; Sound management; Wireless sensor networks",,,,,,,,"(2013) Basu.

A framework was proposed for defining a fair algorithm metric by compiling information and propositions from various papers into a single summarized list of fairness requirements (guideline alike). The researcher can then adopt it as a foundation or reference to aid them in developing their interpretation of algorithmic fairness. Therefore, future work for this domain would have a more straightforward development process. We also found while structuring this framework that to develop a concept of fairness that everyone can accept, it would require collaboration with other domain expertise (e.g., social science, law, etc.) to avoid any misinformation or naivety that might occur from that particular subject. That is because this field of algorithmic fairness is far broader than one would think initially; various problems from the multiple points of view could come by unnoticed to the novice’s eye. In the real world, using active discriminator attributes such as religion, race, nation, tribe, religion, and gender become the problems, but in the algorithm, it becomes the fairness reason. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

To give a theoretical basis for the efforts of preventing corruption that is thick with emotional nuance, this present study employs disruption to psychological contract, i.e. psychological contract breach (PCB), as a predictor of moral emotions proneness. The study involving 265 employees (169 males, 96 females; Mage = 32.32 years old; SDage = 7.28 years) of four big private banks in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, shows that PCB—with noting that, in this study, its scale operational scoring represents, reversely, the contract fulfillment—can predict Guilt-negative behavior evaluation (Guilt-NBE), Guilt-repair (Guilt-REP), and Shame-negative self-evaluation (Shame-NSE); all in negative directions, proved via simple linear regression analyses. Further analysis showed a more dynamic relationship between PCB and Guilt-NBE that fits to a cubic regression model. This study contributes to the axiological aspect of business psychology, especially in the ethical psychology of banking industry. © 2020 The Author(s)","Business psychology; Corruption; Guilt and shame; Moral emotion; Organizational psychology; Psychological contract; Psychology",,,,,"Binus University: 026/VR

The fingerprint is the most used biometric feature caused by its unique, universality and stability. The fingerprint is widely used as a security feature for forensic recognition, building access, automatic teller machine (ATM) authentication or payment. Fingerprint recognition could be grouped in two various forms, verification and identification. Verification compares one on one fingerprint data. Identification is matching input fingerprint with data that saved in the database. In this paper, we measure the performance of the memetic algorithm to process the image fingerprints dataset. Before we run this algorithm, we divide our fingerprints into four groups according to its characteristics and make 15 specimens of data, do four partial tests and at the last of work we measure all computation time. © 2020.

Distribution process carried out the process of acquisition, purchase, storage, distribution, transport, repackaging, re-labeling, documentation, and record-keeping practices. The problems that occur in the validation process of each distribution process in each party involved are not well registered and integrated with each other, so in the complex drug distribution environment, the monitoring process becomes a necessity every time more urgent and primary to reduce theft, prevent counterfeiting, and improve efficiency, synchronization, visibility, and safety. Providing good tracking of goods gives consumers greater interest in the consumption of goods that meet certain ecological and ethical standards and thus requires the quality of the goods consumed. In this thought, it aims to discuss the best blockchain models for the drug distribution process. This research is qualitative research. As a result, the model was introduced as a potential blockchain model and could be applied in pharmaceutical companies in Indonesia.

The problem of car parking is a significant contributor to traffic congestion and has still been a significant problem with the increasing size of vehicles in the luxury segment and also limited parking spaces in urban cities particularly in Jakarta as an Indonesian capital city. The rapid growth in the number of vehicles around the world further adds to the problem of the lack of parking spaces. Our proposed ParkFinderID mobile application has multiple benefits such as for people for easy finding parking space in crowded places, for landlord who wants to let their property land as parking space becoming a new way for disruption technology for getting new or adding income for unused land. For government, this application will make easy their regulation and controlling regarding parking space and traffic jump and at the end of the day will give a huge contribution to society to reduce traffic jump and congestion regarding using sidewalk shoulder rood for illegal parking space. Hopefully, this application will reduce congestion particularly for traffic in Jakarta. © 2020 ISSN.","Parking mobile online application; Smart parking application; Smart parking area; Smart parking lot; Smart parking system",,,,,,,,,"Aalsalem, M.Y., Khan, Z.W., CampusSense, A smart vehicle parking monitoring and management system using ANPR cameras and Android phones (2016) ICACT Trans.

Moreover, frequent change in network quality is another issue that should be limited to run the real fast cloud game. Thus, reliable software components between cloud and user devices as clients, including using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as machine learning, deep learning and so on will enhance the game performance, particularly in multiplayer and real-time conditions. In this paper, we list the mobile cloud game architecture in the high-performance computing (HPC) environment, where a load of the game will be distributed between servers as cloud and clients. The server node as clouds or clients will consist of more than one server with many processors (cores) or sometimes can be recognized as distributed computing. Using HPC for cloud games will boost the game performance where the execution times will be dispersed not only in some node in servers and clients but in many cores of each server or client. The involvement of the internet of things (IoT) and ubiquitous access from heterogeneous devices will give benefit to enjoyment in the game itself. © 2020, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Cloud gaming; Distributed cloud game; HPC cloud game; HPC mobile cloud game; Mobile cloud game",,,,,,,,,"Mell, P., Granee, T., The NIST definition of cloud computing (2011) NIST-National Institute of Standards and Technology, , https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf, [Online].

The growth of the population in Jakarta is increased rapidly. The wage that Many transportations are causing a traffic jam in Jakarta. The government suggests that people use public transportation for their mobility. However, people choose to use their vehicles rather than public transportation. The main reason is that public transportation cannot guarantee the arriving time, whether it is on time or not. Many people move on to online transportation services. However, the massive growth of online transportation is still a contradiction as public transportation. People in Jakarta need faster mobility to go. This research is trying to make a system for public transport without any delay and hard to use it. This problem can be solved by building a new system. This system required e-wallet for payment in public transportation. This E-Wallet will search the possible route from the nearest location to the destination - only the public transport where there is a station that can use it. By using QR-Code generated by e-wallet on the mobile phone, people can scan it directly to a machine located in the station. This method will make a transaction faster than ever. Moreover, people can enjoy another feature like cashback and redeem the prize by a point system. In this era, e-commerce is dominating the market for purchasing something. This is also the attraction of the system.

Literally, it will make the young generation too lazy for outing activity or doing sports and busy with their digital technology, particularly their smartphone. Obviously, we are interested in using the mobile application which can be used to bridge the boring of doing sports mainly badminton sport, wherewith this mobile application is not just only for field badminton or coach booking, but can extend their friendship and community in positive ways. Hopefully, with this mobile application not just only booking for Badminton fields, but beyond that, there will be a mobile application that supports the fans of the badminton sports community when can know each other from different places and make friendship and competition among the members. At the end of the day, we hope this mobile application will support young people to stay away from trouble and drug and to have a positive life with the sport, particularly badminton sport as Indonesian's favorite sport. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Mobile computing; Smartphones; Digital technologies; End of the days; Indonesia; Mobile applications; Smart-phone applications; Young peoples; Sports",,,,,,,,"Sunarya, A., Sutrisno, J., Sistem Informasi Penyewaan Lapangan Bulutangkis dan Penjualan Perlengkapan Maestro Angkasa (2018) Idealis, 1, pp. 358-362; Gunawan, H., Anggianto, Y., Pemanfaatan Teknologi Mobile Untuk Pemesanan Lapangan Berbasis Android (Studi Kasus: Orion Sport Center Purwokerto) (2016) MA, 7, p. 24; Case, M.A., Burwick, H.A., Volpp, K.G., Patel, M.S., Accuracy of Smartphone Applications and Wearable Devices for Tracking Physical Activity Data (2015) JAMA, 9, pp. 1-9; Pasternak, J.B., Cognitive Scripts, Anxiety, and Styles of Coping with Stress in Teenagers Practicing Sports (2018) The Journal of Human Kinetics, 65 (1), pp. 261-271; Charlotte, C., Hille, A., Lechner, M., Mozart or Pele? the effects of Teenagers Participation in Music and Sports CEPR Discussion Paper No. DP 10556; Can, L., Junjie, L., Cao, H., Zhan, M., Design and Implementation of Online Booking Systems of University Sports Avenue (2017) MATEC Web Conf, 100; Clark, R.W., (2018) An Exploratory Study of How Destination Marketing Organizations Pursue the Sports Tourism Market Has Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, 9, pp. 184-193; Newman, T., Peck, J., Wilhide, B., (2017) Social Media in Sports Marketing; Haris, H., Arfiansyah, M., Nuraini, E., RANCANG BANGUN APLIKASI RESERVASI TIKET PESAWAT ONLINE BERBASIS ANDROID (2018) Cerita, 2, pp. 142-150; Honggowibowo, A.S., Sediarte, T., Sistem Reservasi Pesawat Terbang Berbasis Web Jurnal Fakultas Hukum UII, 3, pp. 142-1502005; Phomsoupha, M., Laffaye, G., The Science of Badminton: Game Characteristics, Anthropometry, Physiology, Visual Fitness and Biomechanics (2015) Sports Med, 45 (4), pp. 473-495; Shahril, M.I., Jani, J., Salimin, N., Performance Assessment Instrument (PAI) Model for Badminton Based on Teaching Games for Understanding (TGfU) (2017) Advanced Science Letters, 23 (1), pp. 160-165; Wang, Y., Chen, M., Wang, X., Chan, R.H.M., Li, W.J., IoT for Next-Generation Racket Sports Training (2018) IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 5 (6), pp. 4558-4566; Idris, M.H., Hashim, S.Z.M., UTM Sports App Mobile Application (2017) UTM Computing Proceedings Innovation in Computing Technology and Applications; Falomir, Z., Ortega, J.A., Martinez, N., Guesguen, H., E-Gibalec: Mobile application to monitor and encourage physical activity in schoolchildren (2017) Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments, 9 (5), pp. 595-609; Cvetkovic, B., Janko, V., Gradisek, A., Lustrek, M., Kajtna, T., Strumbelj, B., Mobile Application to Stimulate Physical Activity in School children (2016) 12th International Conference on Intelligent Environments (IE), p. 206; Ginja, G.A., Applications of Virtual Reality in the Practice of Para-Badminton (2018) 20th Symposium on Virtual and Augmented Reality (SVR), p. 230; Shan, C.Z., (2018) SENSOR-BASED ASSESSMENT USING MACHINE LEARNING for PREDICTIVE MODEL of BADMINTON SKILLS","Anwar, N.; Faculty of Computer Science, Indonesia; email: nizirwan.anwar@esaunggul.ac.id","Vaidyanathan S.Mamat M.B.Lien C.-H.Ginta T.L.MujiartoSambas A.",,"Institute of Physics Publishing","2nd International Conference on Computer, Science, Engineering, and Technology, ICComSET 2019","15 October 2019 through 16 October 2019",,159200,17426588,,,,"English","J.

Based on the level of the disorder, blind people are divided into two: Total blind and those who still have the leftover vision (Low Vision). As a result of the loss/reduction of the sensory function of vision, the blind seekers maximize the other sensory functions such as touching, smell, and hearing. Therefore, we have a solution to create a mobile B-Help application that can help the blind and helper communities to deal with and respond to blind people. This smartphone is equipped with a GPS to track blind people by using a smartphone user. © 2019, ICIC International.

This conceptual framework includes problems in predicting student performance, the possibility of graduating on time, and recommends choosing subjects according to performance, and career interests, which are useful for assisting pedagogical interventions in future student development. The success in the development and implementation of the proposed IRS framework is inseparable from using data mining and machine learning techniques in predicting and providing recommendations. Data analysis consisted of clustering techniques, association rules, and classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN). These techniques are used to solve problems related to students and to provide appropriate recommendations. The result is an IRS conceptual framework for the college student that can be used as smart agents to provide student guidance and suggestions to support the process of education in higher education. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data mining; Nearest neighbor search; Recommender systems; Support vector machines; Clustering techniques; Conceptual frameworks; Higher education institutions; Intelligent recommender system; K nearest neighbours (k-NN); Machine learning techniques; Student development; Student performance; Students",,,,,,,,"Alharbi, Z., Cornford, J., Dolder, L., De La Iglesia, B., Using data mining techniques to predict students at risk of poor performance (2016) 2016 SAI Computing Conference (SAI) (IEEE), pp. 523-531; Higher Education Statistical 2017 (2017) Higher Education Statistical Year Book, pp. 1-194. , Ministry of Research Technology and Higher Education of Republic of Indonesia; Flasiński, M., (2016) Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, pp. 3-13; Lu, J., Wu, D., Mao, M., Wang, W., Zhang, G., Recommender system application developments: A survey (2015) Decis.

Educational institutions that provide open networks and connected to many devices simultaneously become an exciting testing ground for cybercriminals. Anti-virus is often used as prevention by applying signature-based detection of specific tiles contained in the database. Unfortunately, because much new malware continues to grow, the detection of the database becomes inaccurate. Therefore, automatic detection has been carried out using Autoencoder hybridized with ANN and CNN approaches. It will be developed using Python programming language with computer specification of 16GB RAM and Processor i7-7500U. Samples used are malware dataset obtained from various types of repositories such as virussign.com, the Zoo, and certain libraries from researchers. The dimensions of samples will be reconstructed using Autoencoder to generate new values that will be used as input on ANN and CNN. This research also has been developed Principal Component Analysis as a comparison architecture. Those approaches provide outstanding results in detecting malware, scilicet PCA-ANN with an accuracy of 0.985, PCACNN with an accuracy of 0.963, Autoencoder -ANN with an accuracy of 0.994, and Autoencoder -CNN with an accuracy of 0.970. Therefore, those approaches can be used as reference in increasing the need for educational institutions to improve their security from malware by detecting tiles that will be sent or read by each user. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial;

There many APIs and algorithms out there that can recognize human faces. These APIs or algorithms is called Artificial Intelligence or AI. As modern civilian life in modern society, AI has been used so many times and developed into something more. This time, we proposed an idea to recognize motions and emotions on human faces to detect their stress levels. Companies nowadays need to have something that can know how their employees are feeling or think about their work. This program works by taking an image input from mounted cameras on the office's monitor. However, before that, the program must have been trained first to recognize faces and emotions. For this, the eigenfaces algorithm is used. After the input is received, then the program will process the image received and extract the features from the images such as eyes, nose, mouth, etc. to detect if there are faces and also the emotions of the face. After that, the features extracted will be matched with the features in the database to give an output of the percentage of stress. © 2019 IEEE.","artificial neural network; eigenfaces; employee stress recognition; face stress recognition","Artificial intelligence; Engineering education; Personnel; Technology transfer; Corporate employees; Eigenfaces; Facial recognition; Human faces; Image inputs; Stress levels; Face recognition",,,,,,,,"Delac, K., Grgic, M., Bartlett, M.S., (2008) Recent Advances in Face Recognition, , (1st ed.).

Many people are clueless regarding what to do when an earthquake occurs. An earthquake has caused a more devastating outcome due to it being able to lead to other hazards. The idea of developing a mobile application surfaced by reading and receiving inspiration from the previous research. Previous research has been implementing different kinds of ways to alert people regarding the upcoming earthquake. The development of a mobile application to provide a platform that will assist people with information on what to do in times of before, during, and after the earthquake. Therefore, people will have a source that they can turn to when seeking information about the steps to be done when an earthquake occurs. Besides, providing information apropos to earthquakes, the mobile application will send further alerts to the people that are in that specific area. Moreover, people will be able to be aware of the particular areas that they are in. The alerts sent will give information to the people so that they could evacuate to safety as soon as possible before the upcoming earthquake occurs. © 2019 IEEE.","a mobile application for mitigation; Earthquake disaster mobile application; natural disaster mitigation","Disasters; Engineering education; Mobile computing; Indonesia; Mobile application development; Mobile applications; Natural disasters; Specific areas; Earthquakes",,,,,,,,"Zambrano, A.M., Perez, I., Palau, C., Esteve, M., Technologies of internet of things applied to an earthquake early warning system (2017) Future Generation Computer Systems, 75, pp. 206-215; Pascapurnama, D.N., Murakami, A., Chagan-Yasutan, H., Hattori, T., Sasaki, H., Egawa, S., Integrated health education in disaster risk reduction: Lesson learned from disease outbreak following natural disasters in Indonesia (2018) International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, (29), pp. 94-102; Graham, F., (2013) Predicting Earthquakes and Saving Lives -with a Smartphone, , https://www.bbc.com, bbc.com, July. 9, [Online]., [Accessed: Sept. 25, 2018]; Kaur, H., Singh Sawhney, R., Komal, N., Wireless sensor networks for disaster management (2012) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Engineering & Technology, 1 (5); (2017) Looking Back at 2017: Natural Disasters in Indonesia, , https://www.Indonesia-investments.com/, Indonesia Investments, Indonesia Investments, Dec. 29, [Online]; (2018) Natural Disasters in Indonesia, , https://www.Indonesia-investments.com/, Indonesia Investments, Indonesia Investments, Sept. 3, [Online]; Wachter, J., Babeyko, A., Fleischer, J., Haner, R., Hammitzsch, M., Kloth, A., Lendholt, M., Development of tsunami early warning systems and future challenges (2012) Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, 12 (1923-1935). , June; Goda, K., Petrone, C., De Risi, R., Rossetto, T., Stochastic coupled simulation of strong motion and tsunami for the 2011 tohoku, Japan earthquake (2017) Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assesment, 31 (9), pp. 2337-2355; Goda, K., De Risi, R., Multi-hazard loss estimation for shaking and tsunami using stochastic rupture sources (2018) Internation Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 28, pp. 539-554; Okada, K., Nakamura, Y., Saruta, M., Application of earthquake early warning system to seismic-isolated buildings (2009) Journal of Disaster Research, 4 (4); Greco, L., Ritrovato, P., Tiropanis, T., Xhafa, F., (2018) IoT and Semantic Web Technologies for Event-detection in Natural Disasters, , [Online]; Erdelj, M., Natalizio, E., Uav-Assisted disaster management: Applications and open issue (2016) International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC 2016), pp. 1-5. , Feb 2016, Kauai, United States; Cheng, M.H., Beck, J.L., Earthquake early warning application to buildings (2014) Engineering Structure, 60, pp. 155-164; Yu, M., Yang, C., Li, Y., Big data in natural disaster management: A review (2018) Geosciences, 18 (165). , May, [online].

The improvement can be seen from various development of a program that may benefit human life. One example of the advancement of technology is artificial intelligence (AI). AI has taken a considerable part in becoming the primary necessity in computer programming. One famous example of AI is object recognition. An arrangement of codes is established for the machine to recognize a picture that is inputted. Even so, the use of object recognition programs that may help mental disorder children is still low - considering that they are still in the age where education is crucial. However, the standard approach of teaching them is not the right way to make them understand since they need individual adjustments and appropriate training for them to follow. Therefore. We are proposing an application that will help to educate mental disorder children through the use of object recognition in visual learning. The app will have built-in features such as vocalize the object's name, which will help mental disorder children to know and remember how it is pronounced. Other features to further improve the education has guessed the word and draw the object which will help them to understand how the object is shaped. Moreover, Researches have proved that learning visually will help mental disorder children to understand better. © 2019 IEEE.","mental disorder children; object recognition; visual learning; visual machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Computer programming; Object recognition; Built-in feature; Human lives; Mental disorders; Previous year; Visual learning; Engineering education",,,,,,,,"Kabali, H.K., Irigoyen, M.M., Nunez-Davis, R., Budacki, J.G., Mohanty, S.H., Leister, K.P., Bonner, R.L., Exposure and use of mobile media devices by young children (2015) Pediatrics, 136 (6), pp. 1044-1050; Kardefelt-Winther, D., How does the time children spend using digital technology impact their mental well-being, social relationships, and physical activity?: An evidencefocused literature review (2017) Unicef-irc.org, , https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/Children-digitaltechnology-wellbeing.pdf, [Online] [Innocenti Discussion Paper 2017-02], [Accessed: 28-Oct-2018]; Ibrahim, R.H., Hussein, D.H., Assessment of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning style among undergraduate nursing students (2016) Int J Adv Nurs Stud, 5 (1), pp. 1-4; Schmidgall, S., Eitel, A., Scheiter, K., Why do learners who draw perform well?

It makes a lot of things in various fields including education becoming more effective and efficient. In education, one of its implementation which is a game is proven to be a useful tool to support conventional teaching methods and bring a more natural understanding of learning materials. Moreover, as a product of the popular culture in modern society, video game mirrors the general culture practice in real life and reflects it via its own culture inside the game. This makes a video game can give a contribution to the social construction of reality as it affects the player's view towards learning in real life and vice versa. From there, we see that there is an opportunity for learning about religion to be supported by its utilization to provide an interactive and fun learning experience. In this paper, we discuss how a video game is implemented to support religious learning. The game was developed with the scrum method where we surveyed to gather the user requirements before the design step. The game design was made by using the use case diagram and storyboard, and it was built using Unity version 2017.3.0f3. © 2019 IEEE.","Game; Mobile game; religion Game; religious Video Game; Serious Game","Human computer interaction; Information and technologies; Learning experiences; Learning materials; Popular cultures; Social constructions; Teaching methods; Use case diagram; User requirements; Engineering education",,,,,,,,"Li, S.D., Familial religiosity, family processes, and juvenile delinquency in a national sample of early adolescents (2013) The Journal of Early Adolescence, 34, pp. 436-462. , 2013; Gockel, A., Burton, D., Can god help?

In this study proposed a cross-project software defect prediction model that applies the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance classes in datasets and ensembles technique to reduce misclassification. The ensemble technique using AdaBoost and Bagging algorithms. The results of the study show that the model that integrates SMOTE and Bagging provides better performance. The proposed model can find more software defects and more precise. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,"Moustafa, S., Elnainay, M.Y., El Makky, N., Abougabal, M.S., Software bug prediction using weighted majority voting techniques (2018) Alexandria Eng.

Along with the development of computer technology, there are a significant data created and wait to be processed; we will get more advantages if it well-processed, if not we will see the data explosion, the data is just a useless stack. Research mitigates the other research paper and makes a conclusion and a report by PRISMA method. The development of computer technology will support the development of an organization. Considering any factors in choosing the right and suitable high-performance computer resource due to our organization is a must. The existing high-performance computing forms are Supercomputer, Grid Computing, Cluster Computing, and Cloud Computing. Based on this work, the last form of high-performance computing, Cloud Computing is one of the most used forms thus we mitigate its advantages and disadvantages. Recently, to process this vast data, we must have a high-performance computer and to provide it, this is not a cheap resource. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cloud computing; Computer resource management; Grid computing; Supercomputers; Cheap resources; Computational technology; Computer technology; Data explosion; High performance computers; High performance computing; Human lives; Research papers; Cluster computing",,,,,,,,"Hadiana, A., (2014) High Performance Computing, , https://lipi.go.id/berita/single/Komputasi-Berkinerja-Tinggi/7904, Accessed December 2, 2018; Buyya, R., (1999) High Performance Cluster Computing: Architectures and Systems, 1. , Prentice Hall; Top500 Supercomputer Lists, , http://www.top500.org/lists, Accessed 29-11-2018; Baun, C., Kunze, M., Kurze, T., Mauch, V., (2011) High Performance Computing As A Service High Performance Computing: From Grids and Clouds to Exascale, , IOS Press; Baun, C., Kunze, M., Nimis, J., Tai, S., (2011) Cloud Computing-Web-Based Dynamic IT Services, , Springer, Germany; Fox, A., Griffith, R., Joseph, A., Katz, R., Konwinski, A., Lee, G., Stoica, I., Above the clouds: A Berkeley view of cloud computing (2009) Dept.

Google Drive is a cloud operating system owned by Google's search engine. National Elementary School (SDN) to make a report book or Basic Education Databook (Dapodik) still use Microsoft Excel, which has the effect of delaying the delivery of report results to parents. This happens because to fill in the DAPODIK score must be filled by teachers who teach subjects in class. This study aims to provide knowledge to teachers in collaborating to fill DAPODIK and measure how reliable the delivery of material received by each teacher. Using the method of reliability Kuder Richardson KR-20 and KR-21 produces a value before the training on reliability values KR-20 = 0.6328, and KR-21 = 0.6000, after the training, the reliability values KR-20 = 0.5788 and KR-21 = 0.6231. From these results, it is known that the value after training for KR-21 has increased and according to the conventional correlation coefficient. In future research can be re-developed by making application system recommendations in determining teachers in schools to become instructors in accordance with the capabilities possessed based on the reliability testing results of the KR-20 and KR-21. © 2019 IEEE.","dapodik; KR-20; KR-21; report book","Search engines; Application systems; Basic educations; Cloud technologies; Correlation coefficient; Elementary schools; Reliability methods; Reliability testing; Reliability values; Reliability",,,,,,,,"Yuliadi, B., Nugroho, A., Integration between management capability and relationship capability to boost supply chain project performance (2019) Int.

This paper proposes a new idea regarding the sensors and the autonomous vehicle framework, such as the usage of some algorithms and new UI along with the data logger. Moreover, the use of a LIDAR sensor is extended, along with a stereo camera and also ultrasonic sensor to make it more precise. Then, a calibration system is made for the stereo camera, which will take help from the ultrasonic sensor. Not the only ultrasonic, camera, and LIDAR, and IMU and GPS sensor are used to know the angle of x, y, and z of our vehicle. Both IMU and GPS are helping in the perception and mostly in the RNDF Localization that will be used in the pathfinding, planning, and control. The global Dynamic-Window approach is applied for the path selection algorithm and combining it with the Autonomous System Approach. The speed selection algorithm will decide on the speed limit and the camera. Not only that but the implement the Inter-Vehicle Algorithm is implemented, which makes the vehicles can exchange information with the other vehicles in the radius of the vehicle. Which all of this together can make a safer driving environment, not only for cars but another vehicle as well. Hope this framework can be used for any other vehicle project and becoming the base of all autonomous vehicle. © 2019 IEEE.","Autonomous Vehicle Framework; LIDAR; NRDF; Safe Driving; Stereo Camera","Automobile drivers; Cameras; Optical radar; Stereo image processing; Ultrasonic sensors; Autonomous systems; Calibration system; Driving environment; NRDF; Path selection algorithms; Safe driving; Selection algorithm; Stereo cameras; Autonomous vehicles",,,,,,,,"Buehler, M., Iagnemma, K., Singh, S., (2007) The 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge: The Great Robot Race, , Springer, Berlin; Montemerlo, M., Thrun, S., Dahlkamp, H., Winning the darpa grand challenge with an ai robot (2006) The Twenty-First National Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the Eighteenth Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference, , Boston, MA; Montemerlo, M., Becker, J., Bhat, S., Junior: The standford entry in the urban challenge (2008) Journal of Field Robotics, 25 (9), pp. 569-597. , Sep; Thrun, S., Montemerlo, M., Dahlkamp, H., Stanley: The robot that won the darpa grand challenge (2016) Journal of Field Robotic, 23 (9), pp. 661-692. , Sep; Hall, R., Kolski, S., MacEk, K., 2D laser-based probabilistic motion tracking in urban-like environments (2009) Journal of Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering, 31 (2), pp. 83-96. , Jun; Stavens, D., Hoffmann, G., Thrun, S., Online speed adaptation using supervised learning for high-speed, off-road autonomous driving (2007) Proceedings of the 20th International Joint Conference on Artifical Intelligence: IJCAI'07, , Hyderabad, India; HAD Site Ibeo Automotive Systems GmbH, Hamburg Ibeo Automotive Systems GmbH, , http://www.ibeo-as.com/had, ibeo, Internet, [Oct. 23 2018]; Deems, J.S., Painter, T.H., Finnegan, D.C., Lidar measurement of snow depth: A review (2013) Journal of Glaciology, 59 (215), pp. 467-479. , Jul; Adi, K., Widodo, C.E., Distance measurement with a stereo camera (2017) International Journal of Innovative Research in Advanced Engineering (IJIRAE), 4 (11), pp. 24-27. , Nov; Mrovlje, J., Vrancic, D., Distance measuring based on stereoscopic pictures (2008) 9th International PhD Workshop on Systems and Control: Young Generation Viewpoint, , Izola, Slovenia; Zivingy, M., Object distance measurement by stereo vision (2013) International Journal of Science and Applied Information Technology (IJSAIT), 2, pp. 5-8. , Jan; Mohammad, T., Using ultrasonic and infrared sensors for distance measurement (2009) International Journal of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, 3, pp. 267-272; Gilabert, G.B., Blanes, F., Simo, J.S., Perez, P., Using infrared sensors for distance measurement in mobile robots (2002) Robotics and Autonomous System, 40, pp. 255-266. , Sep; Koval, L., Vanus, J., Bilik, P., Distance measuring by ultrasonic sensor (2016) IFAC-PapersOnLine, 49, pp. 153-158; Abdulqadir, O.Y., Abduladheem, W.R., Distance measurement using dual laser source and image processing techniques (2015) Journal of Al Rafidain University Colleg, (35), pp. 266-286; Alsultanny, Y.A., Laser beam analysis using image processing (2006) Journal of Computer Science, 2 (1), pp. 109-113; Siegwart, R., Nourbakhsh, I.R., (2004) Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots, , Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press; Chakravorty, S., Kumar, S., Generalized sampling-based motion planners (2011) 2009 IEEE Transaction on System, Man, and Cybernetics, 41; Rarath, D., Sharma, M., Mane, A., Dabral, P., Ade, R., Computer independent data transfer device (2017) International Journal of Recent Contributions from Engineering, Science & IT (IJES), 5 (2), pp. 72-81; Tsugawa, S., Inter-vehicle communication and their application to intelligent vehicles: An overview (2002) IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium, 2002; Seetharaman, G., Lakhotia, A., Blasch, E.P., Unmanned vehicles come of age: The darpa grand challenge (2006) Computer, 39 (12), pp. 26-29; Application Note: Optical Encoders and LiDAR Scanning, , http://www.renishaw.com/en/opticalencoders-And-lidar-scanning-39244, Renishawplc.

Despite its vast paddy field and tropical resources, Indonesia still has not achieved food security. This paper explores ideas about how to present artificial intelligence that may increase rice productivity in Indonesia. Current situations of rice cultivation are mentioned start from existing technologies and systems used in Indonesia. Some artificial intelligence concepts are also introduced. Artificial Intelligence use in rice farming is then analyzed which ideas may be applicable to increase efficiency further. Those that are already implemented in rice farming include diseases and pest detection, prediction and estimation, and automated intelligent systems. In the proposed idea section, ideas to increase production are explored. Using advanced technologies may not be suitable for Indonesia's rice farmers. One argument is to minimize the differences in rice yield in different areas or so what we called yield gap. Factors such as weather, water, and harvest date are those with most impacts on the yield gap. It is beneficial to have a model that can predict the optimal planting date of rice since that will maximize the factors before. Among those implemented, a planting calendar prediction on rice-based on rainfall is already developed. However, rainfall is not the only factor. El-Nino occurrences and temperature changes also have a role in deciding when best to plant rice. The author suggests adding those two new variables, making three in total to the earlier neural network model may improve the overall result. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence for rice productivity;

Starting from the traditional waterfall model to agile methodology, many game developers are trying to produce the methodologies that could solve their problem in game development. In this paper, the type of methodologies will be shown on current game development. Also, this paper would suggest agile methodologies especially scrum over others in game development, and the reason behind that will be explained. Besides that, there are proposed game development methodologies that could solve the problem of game development by involving three phases, including the preproduction phase, production phase, and post-production phase. In the production phase, the sub-steps will have four sub-steps such as design, development, testing and review and the sub-steps will cycle as long as a result are unsatisfied. © 2019 IEEE.","Agile methodology; Game Development; Game development methodology; Methodology; Scrum","Agile Methodologies; Game development; On currents; Preproduction phase; Production phase; Scrum methodologies; Three phasis; Waterfall model; Software design",,,,,,,,"Heidbrink, S., Knoll, T., Wysocki, J., What would Jesus play Actor-centered perspectives on gaming and gamers (2015) Online Heidelberg Journal of Religions on the Internet, 7, pp. 1-16; Jonathan, B., Game Development: Harder than you think (2004) ACM Queue, 1 (10), pp. 29-37. , February; Ambler, S., (2008) Agile Adoption Rate Survey Results: February 2008, , http://www.ambysoft.com/surveys/agileFebruary2008.html, February; Tarhan, A., Yilmaz, S.G., Systematic analyses and comparison of development performance and product quality of incremental process and agile process Journal of Information and Software Technology, 56 (5), pp. 477-494; Heson, V.L., (2008) Agile Dad Agile Method, , http://www.agiledad.com/Documents/AgileDadAgileMethod.pdf; Kalinowski, M., Spínola, R.O., Conte, T., Prikladnicki, R., Fernández, D.M., Wagner, S., Towards building knowledge on causes of critical requirements engineering problems (2015) Conference: International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering; Warnars, H.L.H.S., Object Oriented Modeling with unified modelling language 2.0 for simple Software Application based on Agile methodology (2011) Behaviour & Information Technology An International Journal, 30 (3), pp. 293-307; Reyno, E.M., Cubel, J.A.C., Model-driven game development: 2D platform game prototyping (2008) GAMEON'2008 Conference, pp. 17-19. , November; Ernest, O., Oludele, A., Andre, U., Benjamin, A., Oraibi, W., Raymond, O., Oyindolapo, K., Independent game development (2015) International Journal of Advance Research, IJOAR.org, 3 (3), pp. 2-11. , March; Folmer, E., Game development a solution to escalating costs and expanding deadlines (2007) 10th International Conference on Component-based Software Engineering, pp. 66-73. , July; Xu, S., Rajlich, V., Empirical validation of test-driven pair programming in game development (2006) Computer and Information Science 2006 and 2006 1st IEEE/ACIS International Workshop on Component-Based Software Engineering, Software Architecture and Reuse, pp. 500-505. , ICIS-COMSAR 2006. 5th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on IEEE, July; Gkritsi, A., (2010) Agile Game: A Project Management Game for Agile Methods, , Doctoral Thesis University of Southampton, Electronics & Computer Science, May; Godoy, A., Game-scrum: An approach to agile game development (2010) Ellen F.

Mobile game application along with the development of mobile phone technology such as a smartphone, tablet, and laptop, can be used to increase the player or user interest to engage with religion thing. Using the mobile game application in mobile gadgets will expand quickly to install and use for religion engagement. The player can learn religion things with fun and entertain ways, where the player does not realize that they do something serious in an unserious way. This paper will explain the model system design for mobile game application for learning Catholicism in fun and entertaining way and for the first development was limited to only three Catholic catechisms such as bible learning, church lesson, and liturgy celebration. For the early development, three types of games were developed such as True or False game, Scramble words game, and multiple-choice game. The mobile game model was designed with a use case diagram, storyboard, and class diagram, where for the current implementation the mobile game application was implemented using a ten tables database. © 2019 IEEE.","Game; Game Information Systems; Mobile game; religion Game; religious Video Game; Serious Game","Class diagrams; Human rights; Mobile games; Mobile phone technology; Model system; Multiple choice; Use case diagram; User interests",,,,,,,,"Warnars, H.L.H.S., Game information system (2008) Proceedings of CGAMES 2008-12th International Conference on Computer Games: AI, , Animation, Mobile, Educational and Serious Games, Louisville, Kentucky, USA, 30 July-2 Agt 2008; Warnars, H.L.H.S., Game information system (2010) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology (IJCSIT), 2 (3), pp. 135-148. , June; Suryapranta, L.K.P., Gaol, F.L., Soewito, B., Warnars, H.L.H.S., Kusuma, G.P., Quality measurement for serious game (2017) IEEE International Conference on Applied Computer and Communication Technologies, , IEEE ComCom 2017), Jakarta, Indonesia, 17-18 May; Junaidi, J., Julianto, A., Anwar, N., Safrizal, S., Warnars, H.L.H.S., Hashimoto, K., Perfecting a video game with game metrics (2018) Telkomnika, 16 (3), pp. 1324-1331. , June; Warnars, H.L.H.S., Virtual information system on working area (2008) Indonesian Students' International Scientific Meeting, pp. 169-181; Bahana, R., Gaol, F.L., Wiguna, T., Hendric, S., Soewito, B., Nugroho, E., Dirgantoro, B.P., Abdurachman, E., Performance test for prototype game for children with ADHD (2018) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 978 (1). , March; Pranoto, H., Genaldi, E., Anthony, R., Kurnia, A., Warnars, H.L.H.S., Trisetyarso, A., B.

The evaluated exertion in the UCP method gets from the increase between the UCP esteem and the Effort Value (ER). The expense of ER is the extent of structure of working hours required for each utilization. Determination of ER values only uses data software development projects with simple linear regression analysis. However, most researchers refer to the proposed ER value without questioning or reviewing the ER value. This study evaluates the ER values for software development projects in the business field, namely the Health Surveillance Application. In conducting this research, we need several data on software development projects in the Health Surveillance field from this data. We can find the ER value by analyzing correlation and linear equations. The final results of this study get the benefit of ER 8.0. This price is lower than the quantity suggested by past scientists. Decreasing the ER value can reduce the estimated amount of the effort, then the decrease in estimated business value will reduce the resources needed for software development. May be due to a development project as a component or framework that facilitates project developmen, this is possible for several reasons, including more advanced software engineering technology, rapid growth. © 2019 IEEE.","health surveillance application; Size of software; software metrics; use case point","Application programs; Computer aided software engineering; Health; Monitoring; Regression analysis; Business value; Development project; Health surveillances; Simple linear regression analysis; Software development projects; Software metrics; Use case points; Working hours; Software design",,,,,,,,"https://www.maxmanroe.com/ini-penyebab-kegagalan-startupmenurut-dua-tokoh-startup-indonesia.html; Group, S., (2011) Reports of Chaos, , http:/standishgroup.com/news, Accessed on 1 June 2013; Tokey, Steve, Steve, (2010) Software Return: Maximizing Your Software Investment Return, , Prentice-Hall; Galorath, D., Evans, M.W., (2008) Sizing Software, Estimate, and Risk Management, , Auerbach, in; Endy, M., (2011) Estimated Project of Software, , http:/software.endy.muhardin.com/estimate-probesoftware/, Retrieved March 7, 2013; Ochodek, M., Nawrocki, J., Kwarciak, K., (2011) Simplifying Estimation Effort Based on Use Case Points, , Sciencedirect; Karner, G., (1993) Resource Estimation for Objectory Projects, , Objective System SF AB; Clemmons, R.K., (2006) Use Case Point Project Estimation, , Technical Services Diversified, Inc; https://mx.123dok.com/document/7q01eggzsoftware-projects-effort-estimation-using-use-case-points-method-in-the-context-of-project-management-bodyof-knowledge, Retrieved from; http://elearning.upnjatim.ac.id/courses/REKAYASAPERANGKATLUNAKPAGI/document/slidekuliah/Software_Process_Model_1.ppt?cidReq=REKAYASAPERANGKATLUNAKPAGI, Accessed on July 12, 2013; Robiola, G., Ricardo, O., (2008) Using Case to Early Estimate Effort with Simpler Metrics, , Springer publishing house London Limited; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_Case_Points#Unadjusted_Use_Case_Weight_(UUCW)_2",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","4th International Conference on Informatics and Computing, ICIC 2019","23 October 2019 through 24 October 2019",,157590,,9781728122076,,,"English","Proc.

Data from the satellite usually have lower accuracy than other expensive methods e.g. drone, aerial view, etc. However, the data from satellite have wide range area and sufficient enough for modeling a land use. The accuracy assessment, therefore, becomes a vital task to ensure the model from the satellite imagery meets the minimum requirement. Validating the classification result by comparing to the real location or by other higher resolution images is needed. The paper proposed additional validation by comparing the classification result by another result in different date through the cross-tabulation method. Two satellite imageries in the same year were processed before classification to get the land-use and land-cover classification. Comparing two land-use classified images gave the accuracy statistics using cross-tabulation. The kappa statistic and accuracy showed the classification performance of 0.7592 that similar to the sampling-based accuracy assessment (0.75390). Therefore, the proposed method was appropriate as the accuracy assessment. © 2019 IEEE.","cross-tabulation; kappa statistic; land-use classification; satellite imagery","Antennas; Land use; Satellite imagery; Accuracy measurements; Classification performance; Classification results; cross-tabulation; Higher resolution images; Kappa statistic; Land-use and land cover classifications; Landuse classifications; Image classification",,,,,,,,"Handayanto, R., Tripathi, N.K., Kim, S.M., Herlawati, H., Land use growth simulation and optimization for achieving a sustainable urban form (2018) TELKOMNIKA (Telecommunication Comput.

With advanced technological development and usage in Indonesia, it is expected to have a better health index. However, the health index of the population of Indonesia is still relatively low compared to other countries, being placed at 101 out of 149 countries. Few of the causes of the problem above are the lack of health education, delay in diagnosing/misdiagnosis, and inaccessible healthcare facilities. With the increasing popularity of telemedicine across the world and its nation, Indonesia could improve the healthcare and medical field with the said technology. In this paper, a framework is created and designed for an integrated mobile patient portal for practicing physicians and medical clinics for improving in sharing information in consultations. Furthermore, the application also is intended to help outpatients to make a consultation appointment and increasing outpatient's active engagement and knowledge of their health. This mobile application is expected to be implemented across the nation and to improve the health and medical aspect in Indonesia. © 2019 IEEE.","Electronic Health Record; Electronic Medical Record; Mobile patient application","Health care; Medical computing; Telemedicine; Electronic health record; Electronic medical record; Health education; Healthcare facility; Leading indicators; Mobile applications; Sharing information; Technological development; Diagnosis",,,,,,,,"Debora, Y., (2017) Indeks Kesehatan Indonesia Masih Sangat Rendah, , https://tirto.id/indeks-kesehatanindonesia-masih-sangat-rendah-cBRn, 17 December [Online].

However, in term of location and patient's right for changing the practical doctor, then the patient when moving from one practical doctor to others will have similar and repeated questions such as medicine allergy, history of diseases and so on. Moreover, become a problem for a vulnerable patient such as unconscious patient, disabled or elderly when seeing a new practical doctor and at the end of the day, it will become malpractice. Few of the causes of the problem above are the lack of health education, delay in diagnosing/misdiagnosis, and inaccessible healthcare facilities and with the increasing popularity of telemedicine and IoT across the world, then we need to apply IoT in order to help the patient. In this paper, a framework is created and designed for an IoT-integrated mobile application for the patient where this mobile application is expected to be implemented. © 2019 IEEE.","Electronic Health Record; Electronic Medical Record; Mobile patient application","Internet of things; Medical computing; Mobile computing; Telemedicine; Electronic health record; Electronic medical record; End of the days; Health education; Healthcare facility; Mobile applications; Vulnerable patients; Diagnosis",,,,,,,,"Debora, Y., (2017) Indeks Kesehatan Indonesia Masih Sangat Rendah, , https://tirto.id/indeks-kesehatan-indonesia-masih-sangat-rendah-cBRn, (December 17).

LC-MS consists of Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometer analytical instruments. This device extensively used in Metabolomics, because it provides more comprehensive information about the metabolites. It also shows the breadth of the diversity of chemical compounds in metabolites that make difficult and time-consuming to identification of metabolite's structures. This is an obstacle in efficient and accurate identification. So, many open source softwares developed to simplify and speed up the analysis and interpretation of LC-MS result. There are popular open source softwares. We compiling mini review of this open source softwares. The conclusion is open source softwares quite helpful in terms of data analysis and interpretation of compounds contained, but no one has provided a single interpretation, still need experts for reliable interpretation. © 2019 IEEE.","Chromatography; Frequently Used Software; LC-MS; LC-MS Software; Preprocessing data LC-MS","Biomolecules; Chromatography; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometers; Metabolites; Open systems; Analytical instrument; Comprehensive information; LC-MS; Lc-ms analysis; Metabolomics; Preprocessing data LC-MS; Speed up; Open source software",,,,,,,,"Bla enovic, I., Kind, T., Ji, J., Fiehn, O., Software tools and approaches for compound identification of lc-ms/ms data in metabolomics (2018) Metabolites, 8 (2); Beirnaert, C., Using Expert Driven Machine Learning to Enhance Dynamic Metabolomics Data Analysis (2019) Metabolites, 9 (3), p. 54; Lamichhane, S., Sen, P., Dickens, A.M., Hyötyläinen, T., Ore ic, M., An Overview of Metabolomics Data Analysis: Current Tools and Future Perspectives (2018) Compr.

The project manager or project owner really needs a good calculation so that the use of resources can be done more efficiently. Use Case Points (UCP) is one method that can be used to measure the size of a software based on a use case diagram. Use case diagrams are usually made before the application begins to be developed into the application. In the calculation of UCP, there are 2 additional factors carried out: Technical Complexity Factor (TCF) and Environmental Factor (EF). This paper presents measurement software using use case points on the SIB mobile application. This application has never been measured both in terms of cost and size of the project. The results of the use case points method produce a UCP value of 129.86 and Effort Estimation (Effort) value of 1298.6 hours. With these results, the project manager gets a picture of the project so that the efficiency of the resources can be carried out properly. © 2019 ISSN.","Mobile application; Software cost; Software metric; Software size; Use case points",,,,,,,,,"(2018) Number of Apps Available in Leading App Stores as of 3rd Quarter 2018, , https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores; Kashyap, D., Shukla, D., Misra, A.

The EA supports achieving organizational goals because of its functions. This paper discusses the results of literature review for the EA function. There are at least three reasons for using EA in organizations: its complexity, external force to change, and the alignment of business with Information Technology (IT). Furthermore, this paper also discusses how the EA functions can offer benefit for the Village Law. The Village Law is a legal product in Indonesia that is used as a legal umbrella to build Indonesia. A proper EA function perspective is needed to build a village supported by information technology. © BEIESP.","Alignment; Anticipate Change; Enterprise Architecture; Function of Enterprise Architecture; Reduce Complexity; The Village Law",,,,,,,,,"Bailey, I., A simple guide to enterprise architecture (2006) Model Futur; (2014) Undang-Undang Desa, 1. , No. 6 Tahun2014; Ed, H.J., (2017) Architecture Content Framework with the Archimate Modelling Language, , March; Alwadain, A., Fielt, E., Korthaus, A., Rosemann, M., Empirical insights into the development of a service-oriented enterprise architecture (2016) Data Knowl.

With Indonesia undergoing 2019 presidential election, a detection of buzzers that causes much trouble in maintaining information neutrality is seen as a needed. One of the many reasons is because those buzzers spread false news making the information gained by the use of social media to be not neutral and deliberately offends or attack those that they are not in favor of. Those buzzers share a similar characteristic, tendency, or even possess the same pattern. Grouping, classification, and detection method are used to counter this problem. This research gives a slight overview of what is happening in social media and a theory of how to deal with those problems.

The primary purpose of this research is to develop e-commerce for online games and explain the benefit that people can get from it. This research focuses on building an online marketplace based on a website that can provide an opportunity to do it transaction related to a specific game. Mainly, the online games marketplace quality will be based on user satisfaction and user recommendation from the previous research. Meanwhile, these satisfaction level include four dimensions that decide the perceived value of the user reason for purchasing an online games item, which are functional value, emotional value, monetary value, and social value. From that information, we build a marketplace for online games item to satisfy the user requirement and also benefiting with its advantages. We also provide the difference between e-commerce mainly with our proposed e-commerce for online games item. The results will be a full-fledged web-based application for online games item marketplace. This paper will be an opportunity to further development of online games marketplace for the growth of online games transaction. © 2019 IEEE.","E-Commerce; Item Purchase; Online Game Marketplace; Online games; Online Games Item; Virtual Item","Behavioral research; Electronic commerce; Websites; Four dimensions; On-line games; On-line marketplaces; User recommendations; User requirements; User satisfaction; Virtual items; Web-based applications; Social networking (online)",,,,,,,,"Artz, B., Kitcheos, A., (2016) Microtransactions: A Study of Consumer Behavior and Virtual Goods/Services among Students at Linköping University in Sweden, , http://www.divaportal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A941477&dswid=-8283, Bachelor Thesis, Business Administration, Linköping University.

PT GMF AeroAsia is a world-class company that focuses on Aircraft Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO). The company strives to increase performance through the productive and efficient use of man-hours. If PT GMF AeroAsia's performance is consistently high, revenue and profit will support the company's vision and mission to be one of the Top Ten MRO's in the World. For example, detailed research and analysis are conducted primarily in the area of cabin base maintenance where project performance, man-hours, and productivity are studied in detail to assist with production planning and control. Design and change requests are managed via an Executive Information System (EIS) that correlates and displays data using a dashboard to facilitate decision making by Section Manager, General Manager, and Vice President. The dashboard is used to identify, control and analyze the conduct of every aircraft maintenance project. The EIS, therefore, underpins and provides the logic for the Decision Support System (DSS). The DSS uses data drawn from the EIS to provide a standard approach leading to effective decision making. © 2018 IEEE.","Decision Support System (DSS); Executive Information System (EIS); Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO); Manhours productivity","Aircraft; Aircraft manufacture; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Information systems; Information use; Managers; Pattern recognition; Production control; Productivity; Repair; Aircraft maintenance; Decision support system (dss); Executive information systems; General manager; Maintenance repair and overhauls; Production planning and control; Project performance; Research and analysis; Cabins (aircraft)",,,,,,,,"Thusoo, A., Sarma, J.S., Jain, N., Shao, Z., Chakka, P., Zhang, N., Antony, S., Murthy, R., Hive-A petabyte scale Data Warehouse using Hadoop (2010) 26th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), , Callifornia, USA, 1-6 March; (2013), https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/article/402274/etl-big-data-with-hadoop.pdf, Extract, Transform, and load Big Data with Apache Hadoop, White paper, Intel Coorporation,.

The empirical study found that the presence of non-cash payment instruments using cards can replace the role of cash payment instruments in economist transactions in Indonesia. The growth of electronic money when viewed on a monthly basis is much faster than the growth of debit and credit card cards, a monthly increase of electronic money can reach 70% -100%, while debit and credit card cards only grow in the range of 20%. This study aims to analyze the design of e-money, as well as provide some development ideas that must be done related to the implementation of e-money. © 2018 IEEE.","business strategy; cashless payment; e-money; electronic banking; fintech; strategic planning; the blockchain","Pattern recognition; Strategic planning; Business strategy; Cash payments; cashless payment; Credit cards; Electronic banking; Empirical studies; fintech; Payment instrument; Electronic money",,,,,,,,"Uddin, Salah, M., Yesmin, A., Akhi, E-wallet system for Bangladesh an electronic payment system (2014) International Journal of Modeling and Optimization, 4 (3). , June 2014; O'Sullivan, A., Sheffrin, S.M., Economics: Principles in action (2003) Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458: Pearson Prentice Hall, p. 261; Taylor, S., Todd, P.A., Understanding information technology usage: A test of competing models (1995) Information Systems Research, 6 (2), pp. 144-176; (2014) News Letter Bank Indonesia, Gerai Info BI No50.

All ideas from the development of intelligent transportation to a town that wants to build and want to change into a smart city, especially in the field of ACP (system created, computing developed), based on parallel management and control system (PTMS). PTMS is considered to be enlarged to a new generation of an intelligent transportation system, and its essential component of architecture then make the hardware and software that will support a new architecture in a developing city to a smart city. The case in a lift is a communication system on a car that uses peer to peer networks and smart cards, with a communication system in a vehicle is expected to control congestion in a developing city through an original town with a connected system. This paper proposed four aspects of surveillance such as Traffic surveillance, vehicle Surveillance, passenger surveillance and driver surveillance.

Many methods for face recognition such as holistic learning, the use of local features, shallow learning and deep learning, some methods are susceptible to variations in pose change, illumination, expression and age variation. State of the art of face recognition today is a deep learning technique that delivers high accuracy. In this paper author replicate an face recognition using deep learning architecture called OpenFace Convolutional Neural Network. In this research author make variation on the size of image, color dept and age, and see how that factor impact on accuracy of face recognition in that architecture. As the result from the research, the accuracy of a model depends on the image size, color depth, and age variation, but in OpenFace CNN that recognition still provides fairly good accuracy when reducing the size of image and color depth, as long as the image can still be detected on the landmark facial, so the alignment process can be done on the face image. © 2018 IEEE.","Age variant; Color Depth; Convolutional Neural Network; Face Recognition; Image Size","Color; Convolution; Deep learning; Network architecture; Neural networks; Age variant; Biometric authentication; Color depth; Convolution neural network; Convolutional neural network; Image Size; Learning architectures; Learning techniques; Face recognition",,,,,,,,"Turk, M., Pentland, A., Eigenfaces for recognition (1991) J.

Social media is an Information and Communication Technology product which is a trend of future communication styles, and communication is all about an activity to share the news. The news shared on social media are not always incredible resources, or on the other hand, we can say that most of them are a hoax. According to this condition, research would like to explore what kind of method approach to detect hoax news. This research uses a survey approach to papers published during 2016-2018. By doing this work, we can know the kind of algorithms used for a similar research topic. The most popular approach according to this work is the Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the most used social media platform is Twitter. © 2018 IEEE.","classification; hoax news; social media; Support Vector Machine; twitter","Classification (of information); Pattern recognition; Support vector machines; Surveys; Communication styles; hoax news; Information and Communication Technologies; Research topics; Social media; Social media platforms; twitter; Social networking (online)",,,,,,,,"Papadopoulos, S., Bontcheva, K., Jaho, E., Lupu, M., Castillo, C., Overview of the special issue on trust and veracity of information in social media (2016) ACM Trans.

With gamification, a lot of people help people learn something natural, and gamification is usually inspired by everyday life, for example, the game The Sims, which combines daily life with a game in sports is one of the best examples of gamification implementation. Using gamification in a game makes learning more enjoyable than learning with truth, and without realizing it they have done learning. In this paper we proposed a gamification architecture for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) which include logic game such as brain, think, body, move, sport and logic. Moreover, there are five methods proposed for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) such as object game, content, and player, design, and framework, deploy and play, and finish structure. © 2018 IEEE.","ADHD games;

Not only to the quality of products produced, but also to business processes and resources owned. One of the resources possessed by the manufacturing industry is data; proper data management will undoubtedly generate useful information as well. Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is one of the systems that play a role in providing data production process. This paper will explain how to implement a data warehouse in a manufacturing industry, especially the method of mixing in the tire manufacturing industry based on the principle of Extraction Transformation and Load (ETL), and proof it in an application prototype. We use information processing, analytical processing, and data mining methodology for this research. The result of the process is a new table called process-pivot-transform. This paper describes how the technical implementation of a data warehouse in a case study on the mixing process in the manufacturing industry particularly in tire manufacture. © 2018 IEEE.","ETL; manufacturing industry; MES; mixing","Competition; Data handling; Data mining; Data warehouses; Information use; Manufacture; Metadata; Mixing; Pattern recognition; Tires; Business Process; Data production; Manufacturing Execution System; Manufacturing industries; Mixing process; Quality of product; Technical implementation; Tire manufacture; Information management",,,,,,,,"Gröger, C., Schlaudraff, J., Niedermann, F., Mitschang, B., Warehousing manufacturing data.

To increase the inventory warehouse system performance, then business process as Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) should be separated from the reporting process as Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) application. Big Data as the current most alluring technology, is undoubtedly the top choice in intelligent application implementation. To understand what is 'Big Data,' then we should refer to previous technology and Big Data as a metamorphosis from last OLAP technology such as Data Warehouse, DSS, EIS, BI and so on. Thus, since Big Data as a metamorphosis from previous technology then we can apply Big Data for OLAP process to create an intelligent application which supports reporting for the decision-making process. This Big Data implementation was running on one single node/computer, where Hadoop for windows x64 was installed. The proposed Big Data application was split into two sub-processes such as Big Data process and Big Data result. Big Data process reads the OLTP database and export into an input text file, and the text file was processed with MapReduce algorithm and import into output text file. Meanwhile, Big Data result shows the summarization of Map and Reduce process from output text file. © 2018 IEEE.","Big Data; Data Warehouse; inventory warehouse systems; MapReduce; OLAP; OLTP; structured data","Data warehouses; Decision making; Pattern recognition; Map-reduce; OLAP; OLTP; Structured data; Warehouse systems; Big data",,,,,,,,"Thusoo, A., Sarma, J.S., Jain, N., Shao, Z., Chakka, P., Zhang, N., Antony, S., Murthy, R., (2010) Hive - A Petabyte Scale Data Warehouse Using Hadoop, 26th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), , Callifornia, USA, 1-6 March; (2013) Extract, Transform, and Load Big Data with Apache Hadoop, , https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/article/402274/etl-big-data-with-hadoop.pdf, White paper, Intel Coorporation,.

The chatbot model used is a cahatbot model across business/service fields. The training data used in this research are the data on customer service talks with its customers in several business fields or services. To compare the models generated from the LSTM algorithm and Simple RNN algorithm, two tests were carried out, the first test is testing the chat output manually which was done directly by humans and the second test are comparing the LSTM algorithm and Simple RNN algorithms using the same training data and test data. From the experimental results, it was found that the chat output generated by the LSTM algorithm relatively can answer most of the tests correctly rather than Simple RNN algorithm.

The popularity of the game has raised the attention of many researchers from various research domains. But there are some problems in game design. One of these problems is a game adaptation that can be defined freely as the game's ability to adapt to various factors such as: gamer's skills, emotion playing, layer formats, and hardware platforms. The purpose of this paper is to propose a case-based reasoning (CBR)-based game architecture for designing adaptive text-based computer games that will be used as a delivery of high performance computing (HPC) learning. © 2018 IEEE.","Adaptive; case-based reasoning (CBR); Design; Game; High Performance Computing (HPC)","Case based reasoning; Design; Pattern recognition; Adaptive; Casebased reasonings (CBR); Game; Game architecture; Hardware platform; High performance computing; High performance computing (HPC); Research domains; Computer games",,,,,,,,"Prasad, S.K., Chtchelkanova, A., Dehne, F., Gouda, M., Gupta, A., Jaja, J., Kant, K., Wu, J., (2012) NSF/IEEE-TCPP Curriculum Initiative on Parallel and Distributed Computing-Core Topics for Undergraduates, 55p. , www.cs.gsu.edu/-tcpp/curriculum/index.php, Version I,.

This comparison aims to find the most appropriate similarity coefficient for some cases. Many results found that Sorensen-dice coefficient and Jaccard coefficient is close or even identical. But Jaccard coefficient can not handle properly for sets with real-value or weighted sets or any pair of vectors. So, Jaccard coefficient redefined as Generalized Jaccard Coefficient. This paper shows the correlation between Sorensen-dice coefficient with Generalized Jaccard Coefficient using Spearman's correlation as predecessors research did and using ANOVA to ensure the results. This research find that the comparison between them is less similar from predecessors research. © 2018 IEEE.","comparison; Generalized Jaccard Similarity; rodent tuber; similarity coefficient; Sorensen-Dice Similarity","Software engineering; comparison; Generalized Jaccard Similarity; rodent tuber; Similarity coefficients; Sorensen-Dice Similarity; Pattern recognition",,,,,,,,"Sianipar, N.F., Ariandana, Maarisit, W., Detection of gamma-irradiated mutant of rodent tuber (typhonium flagelliforme lodd) (2015) Vitro Culture by RAPD Molecular Marker, 14, pp. 285-294; Laurent, D., Sianipar, N.F., Chelen, L., Wantho, A., Analysis of genetic diversity of Indonesia rodent tuber (typhonium flagelliforme lodd.)

The rodent tuber plant has a low anticancer compound which does not have an economic value to be utilized on an industrial scale, particularly to explore as an anticancer drug. The material plant was used 30 clones of Rodent Tuber Pekalongan to increase its bioactive compounds using a combination of in vitro culture with gamma-ray irradiation. The selection process has been done until the 8th generation and obtained 14 somaclonal mutants that have higher bioactive compounds than control plant (non-mutant). This study aimed to analyze the genetic variation of 14 somaclonal mutants of rodent tuber using RAPD with 14 primers. The results were produced 513 total bands with the size of 200-5000 bp and 380 polymorphic bands between somaclonal mutants. OPB-18 primer produced the most polymorphic bands and five specific polymorphic bands of 1336 bp, 1070 bp, 901 bp, 861 bp and 728 bp in the somaclonal mutant M23 (20-4-2-1-1-1). OPD-20 primer produced seven specific polymorphic bands of 1574 bp, 1557 bp, 1501 bp, 1496 bp, 1234 bp, 1229 bp and 1086 bp in the M23 somaclonal mutant. The phylogenetic analysis showed that there were two main groups with the coefficient similarity between 0.77 and 0.83. The highest genetic variation obtained was found in the M23 somaclonal mutant with a genetic difference of 23% compared with control. There are five somaclonal mutants (M24, M22, M21, M16, M14) that have a genetic variation of up to 22% over the control. This study shows that OPB-18 and OPD-20 primers were efficient in detecting somaclonal mutant variants. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The k-NN algorithm works by making a prediction based on the closest data points between the old data history as training data and the new data as testing data. The data collected totals 1018 students with 24 scholarship receiver candidate students are used as the dataset for the test purposes. The attributes used in the prediction process are a semester, parents' income, number of family dependents, and Cumulative Grade Point Average. The distance calculation of the value from testing attribute to each training attribute uses Euclidean Distance equation, while the test of the model accuracy value is calculated using Confusion Matrix. The results of the simulation of the prediction model show that the determining factor of training data from both the number and the variation of different values can improve the performance of the k-NN algorithm with the best accuracy rate of 95.83 percent in predicting students who have the greatest chance of getting the scholarship. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Education computing; Forecasting; Motion compensation; Pattern recognition; Statistical tests; Students; Confusion matrices; Cumulative grade point averages; Distance calculation; Euclidean distance; K nearest neighbor algorithm; K-nearest neighbors; Prediction model; Prediction process; Nearest neighbor search",,,,,,,,"Kurniadi, D., Warnars Sasmoko, H.L.H.S., Gaol, F.L., Software size measurement of student information terminal with use case point in (2017) IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Computational Intelligence (CyberneticsCom), pp. 164-169; Aulawi, H., Ramdhani, M.A., Slamet, C., Ainissyifa, H., Darmalaksana, W., Functional Need Analysis of Knowledge Portal Design in Higher Education Institution (2017) Int.

Moreover, the AOI-HEP data mining technique has been improved with confidence mining pattern into two terms, where firstly give confidence mining pattern for each AOI-HEP pattern either frequent or similar pattern. Secondly, give confidence for each dataset as confidence AOI-HEP pattern between frequent and similar patterns. Confidence for each AOI-HEP pattern will show how interested each of AOI-HEP pattern between frequent and similar pattern, whilst confidence per dataset will show how interested each dataset between frequent and similar pattern. In this paper the mining of AOI-HEP has been extended to mine AOI-HEP association rules using the current AOI-HEP frequent pattern, since association rule deal with frequent pattern. Based from previous experiments upon 4 UCI machine learning datasets such as adult, breast cancer, census and IPUMS, there are 9 finding AOI-HEP frequent patterns where 8 from adult and breast cancer datasets respectively.

A close and tight match is what make MOBA fun to play and increase its user satisfaction, but some factor may ruin the matchmaking and create unbalanced match between the two team. Those problems factors are high latency, players with bad attitude, and players doing unfamiliar role. We use DOTA 2 as our case study. Then we compare the DOTA 2 matchmaking system in other sector to make comparison. Lastly, we discuss about solution to solve MOBA matchmaking problem such as displaying live information about online players, players searching for games, servers online and ETA for gaming to start. In addition, we proposed new variable to be considered in the matchmaking system, which are Preferences Role, player’s chosen preferences role will be considered while the system set up the game to minimize the number of unbalanced games in MOBA. © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

This metrics used to identify measurable properties of the code and relation between them. Several measures can be calculated with this method are program vocabulary, program length, volume, difficulty and effort. In learning process, the final result obtained by students should be linear with the results obtained each time the students doing their exercises. This study aims to see the pattern similarity relationship between coding that students do on each exercise in term of difficulty, programming effort and programming time with the final value that they obtained. The experiment was done by giving the students three sets of exercise questions which were derived from the final problem, then each set of exercise code done by each students measured using halstead method and compare with the final grade obtained by each student. © 2018 IEEE.","halstead; pattern; programming; software metric","Codes (symbols); Mathematical programming; Complexity measures; halstead; Learning process; pattern; Pattern similarity; Programming time; Software metrices; Software metrics; Students",,,,,,,,"Arpaia, P., Bernardi, M.L., Di Lucca, G., Inglese, V., Spiezia, G., An aspect-oriented programming-based approach to software development for fault detection in measurement systems (2010) Comput.

One of the benchmarks used is to measure the level of maturity of IT Governance. COBIT 5 becomes the main reference that is often used for these needs. But to do the assessment takes a long time because of the many processes assessed. This becomes an obstacle for a very dynamic company, the business has changed but the new assessment is completed. The authors propose a new approach using a priority model that adopts a enterprise strategy and incorporates it with a follow-up of previous IT Governance audit results. Tests have been conducted one of the state-owned enterprises in Indonesia engaged in the financial sector and has a dynamic business. The results showed that the assessment can effectively improve the quality of corporate IT objectives with the acceleration of the assessment process up to 20%. © 2018 IEEE.","COBIT 5; Effective assessment; Enterprise IT Goals; IT Governance; IT on State Own Company; Prioritisation Approach","COBIT 5; Effective assessment; Enterprise IT; IT governance; On state; Prioritisation Approach",,,,,,,,"Steuperaert, D., Improving the quality of the COBIT 5 goals cascade as an it process prioritisation mechanism (2016) International Journal of IT/Business Alignment and Governance, 7 (2), pp. 49-69; Pasquini, A., Galie, E., COBIT 5 and the process capability model.

There are many new mobile applications with high user feedback but few download rates. Moreover, some users of the application are unwilling to give their feedbacks. This abrupt state is caused by the carelessness of mobile application developers in noticing the importance of user feedback and user behavior. In this paper, we will state several steps and options that could be taken by mobile application developers to popularize their mobile application. This solution is mainly focused on the utilization of user feedback and user behavior, which also include proper use of feedback loop, great advertising, and behavioral change. The objectives of this analysis are to change unpopular mobile applications with high user feedback to become popular mobile application with high user download rate, as well as to encourage users to properly express their opinion regarding the application by giving out their feedback to the mobile application developers. © 2017 IEEE.","Behavioral Change; Download Rate; Feedback Loop; Mobile Application; User Behavior; User Feedbacks","Artificial intelligence; Feedback; Internet of things; Mobile computing; Behavioral changes; Feed-back loop; Mobile applications; User behaviors; User feedback; Behavioral research",,,,,,,,"Islam, R., Islam, R., Mazumder, T.A., Mobile application and its global impact (2010) International Journal of Engineering & Technology, 10 (6), pp. 72-78; (2015) Mobile Medical Application: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, , U.S. Department of Health Human Services Food and drug Administration, Rockville, MD, USA, February; Holzer, A., Ondrus, J., Mobile application market: A developer's perspective (2011) Telematics and Informatics, 28 (1), pp. 22-31; Adrian, D., Tarigan, R.E., The effect of revenue and market segmentation level towards venture capital investment in mobile application business (2014) International Journal of Communication & Information Technology (CommIT), 8 (1), pp. 10-16. , May; Cheng, J., Mizli, C.D.N., Leskovec, J., How community feedback shapes user behaviour (2014) Proceedings of the 8th International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, , 1-4 June; Hattie, J., Timperley, H., The power of feedback (2007) Review of Educational Research, 77 (1), pp. 81-112. , March; Renaud, K., Cooper, R., Feedback in human computer interaction-characteristic and reccomendation (2000) South African Journal, 2000 (26), pp. 105-114. , Nov; Brookhart, S.M., (2008) How to Give Effective Feedback to Your Student. 2nd Ed, , Virginia, USA, Association for Supervision and CurriculumDevelopment (ASCD); Storey, J., (2015) Cultural Theory and Popular Culture, 7th Ed, , New York, USA, Routledge; Astrom, K.J., Murray, R.M., (2008) Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers, , New Jersey, USA.

In recent years there have been several studies that have used games, especially computer-based ones to improve the executive function of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) especially in working memory improvements. There are still several obstacles in using computer-based games that have been circulating today in Indonesia. The aim of this research is to develop and create a prototype game that can be used to improve working memory of children with ADHD using Bahasa Indonesia. The prototype game application is a race game with matching colors and memory work tasks; developed using Construct2. Players will play as a driver, delivering certain fruits to specific homes with different colors. The game also included visuospatial tasks such as remembering the objects. For performance test, CPU utilization, average FPS and image memory usage has been tested in several browsers. In conclusion, the performance tests results show that the first type of the prototype game is good enough to be played in desktop or laptop. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Software prototyping; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; CPU utilization; Executive function; Game for children; Image memory; Performance tests; Work task; Working memory; Computer games",,,,,,,,"https://newzoo.com/about, Newzoo [Internet].

As strong discriminator, EPs will be interested to be used, applied and mixed in many algorithms for finding patterns in many different datasets particularly for text datasets. Using EPs algorithm in Database Management Systems (DBMS) such as MySQL, SQLServer and etc will be interested as well and need to be explored. The differences between 2 datasets literally discriminate knowledge between those datasets which represent with growthrate number as justification of EPs. Moreover, confidence of EPs can be measured in order to secure of finding EPs where confidence will have 100% as maximum score. Since the discrimination is not only between 2 datasets then EPs algorithms have been extended to discriminate between more than 2 datasets which recognized as EPs classification and there are many EPs classification algorithms including Jumping EPs classification as well. © 2017 IEEE.","Classification Emerging Patterns; Discriminating Emerging Patterns; Jumping Emerging Patterns","Artificial intelligence; Database systems; Classification algorithm; Emerging patterns; Jumping emerging pattern; Maximum score; Classification (of information)",,,,,,,,"Dong, G., Li, J., Efficient mining of emerging patterns: Discovering trends and differences (1999) Proc. of the 5th ACM SIGKDD Int.

Doing DW to your systems should apply to the mother knowledge of AI which we recognized as Software Engineering (SE) where we should apply best software application in more importantly we should satisfy the user. In order to make a good DW model design as user expectation then we should apply 3 steps such as collect all the needed reporting, order all the reports start from the most needed reports and mapping all the ordered reports into fact constellation schema.

However the threat of Hoax is also increasing in social media which increase the risk of mass panic, where the society become confuse between false and true, other words between hoax and not hoax. To mitigate the effect of hoax, a system to filter out hoax posts from social media is proposed. We propose a system framework that might be able to filter out hoax from social media post feeds in order to reduce the amount of hoax posts in social media. It is difficult to reduce 100% hoax from social media, but at least there is a technology which can decrease the hoax in social media. This system works by utilizing data mining to search past hoax records and analyze the post data pattern to determine whether a post is a hoax or not hoax. Our proposed system will also utilize social media Application Program Interface (API) such as news, facebook, twitter, in order to find similar writing in other social media or news website to find out the authenticity of a person's post. © 2017 IEEE.","Application Program Interface; Data Mining; Hoax; Hoax Detection; Social Media","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Filtration; Search engines; Application program interfaces; Data patterns; Facebook; Hoax; News websites; Social media; System framework; Social networking (online)",,,,,,,,"Mayfield, A., (2017) What Is Social Media, , www.icrossing.com/uk/default/filesuk/insightpdffiles/What%20is%20Social%20MediaiCrossingebook.pdf, Access on 8 June; Perrin, A., (2000) Social Media Usage, , 2015"", Numbers, Facts and Trends shaping the world, Pew Research Center, October 2015; Wijaya, A., Girsang, A., The use of data mining for prediction of customer loyalty (2016) CommIT Journal, 10 (1), pp. 41-47; Lewis, D., Jones, K., Natural language processing for information retrieval (1996) Communications of the ACM, 39 (1), pp. 92-101. , July; Allcott, H., Gentzkow, M., Social media and fake news in the 2016 election (2017) Journal of Economic Perspective, 31, pp. 211-236; Tritama, H.B., Tarigan, R.E., The effect of social media to the brand awareness of a product of a company (2016) CommIT Journal, 10 (1), pp. 9-14; Situngkir, H., Spread of Hoax in Social Media, , https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/30674, Access on: 8 June 2017; Sag, I., Baldwin, T., Bond, F., Copestake, A., Flickinger, D., (2017) Multiword Expressions: A Pain in the Neck for Nlp, , http://hdl.handle.net/10220/6828, Access On: 8 June; Inibaru, Lebih Dari 90% Penyebaran Berita Hoax Lewat Medsos, , http://inibaru.id/post/lebih-dari-90-penyebaran-berita-hoaxlewat-medsos/on, Access 8 June 2017; Arun, K., Nayagam, M.G., Building applications with social networking api's (2014) Int.

Every year, the number of mobile application is increased. It is important for mobile application project owners to calculate the required resources before building a mobile application. In software metric, Use Case Points method is able to count software size of mobile application based on their functionality. This method utilizes use case diagram as their computation factors in the estimation process. Moreover, two other complexity factors are also considered in this method, which are: Technical Complexity Factor and Environment Factor. In this paper, we present software size calculation of QuestDone Mobile Application using 7 steps use case points method. QuestDone has been implemented, but we do not know its software size (i.e. how big the software, how much it cost, how many people is needed). As the result from use case points method, the Use Case Points value of QuestDone is 126.88 with Effort Estimation equal to 889 hours. The software size estimation process of QuestDone Mobile Application detailed in this paper can give an insight to project owners to count software size of other similar projects. © 2017 IEEE.","mobile application; software metrics; software size; use case points","Artificial intelligence; Mobile computing; Environment factors; Estimation process; Mobile applications; Software metrics; Software size; Software size estimation; Technical complexity; Use case points; Application programs",,,,,,,,"Costello, S., How Many Apps Are in the App Store?""

The first two offer more flexibilities but greatly differ in complexities. General-purpose language is probably overkill for a simple data entry application. In order to be useful, domain-specific language should be as close as possible to the problem domain and still open to research. This paper presents Perkedel, a domain-specific programming language designed for data entry. It is inspired by spreadsheet concept and offers user interface definitions that resemble a paper-based data entry form. Spreadsheet is one of the most popular programming systems that has been around us for almost four decades and we argue that easy user interface definition is important. This results in writing source code for a data entry application that looks nothing like ordinary source code. This speeds up the development time, too. One of our respondents spent only five minutes to a develop a simple data entry application, compared to the fastest development time of 32 minutes using a generalpurpose language, for similar application. That way, we hope that Perkedel may add a little perk to data entry developer's life using this data entry language. © 2017 IEEE.","data entry; domain-specific programming language; programming language; spreadsheet","Ada (programming language); Artificial intelligence; Computer programming languages; Data acquisition; Problem oriented languages; Spreadsheets; Development time; Domain specific languages; Domain specific programming languages; General purpose languages; General-purpose programming language; Problem domain; Programming system; Source codes; User interfaces",,,,,,,,"Soewito, N.B., Gaol, F.L., Abbas, B.S., Multi-platform application user interface design (2017) The International Conference on Advanced Management and Information Technology Service; Van Deursen, A., Klint, P., Domain-specific language design reqires feature description (2002) Journal of Computing and Information Technology, 10 (1), pp. 1-7; Van Deursen, A., Klint, P., Visser, J., (2000) Domain-Specific Language: An Annotated Bibliography, Sigplan Notices, 35 (6), pp. 26-36; Ayalew, Y., Clermont, M., Mittermeir, R.T., Detecting Errors in Spreadsheets, , arXiv preprint arXiv: 0805.1740, 2008; Abraham, R., Burnett, M., Erwig, M., Spreadsheets programming (2008) Wiley Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Engineering; Power, D.J., A brif history of spreadsheets (2004) DSSResources.Com; Nardi, B.A., Miller, J.R., (1990) The Spreadsheets Interface: A Basic for End User Programming, , Hewlett-Packard Laboratories; Sebesta, R.W., (2012) Concepts of Programming Language, , 10 th ed, Pearson Education Inc; Spinellis, D., Notable design patterns for domain specific language (2001) Journal of Systems and Software, 56 (1), pp. 91-99; Mernik, M., Heering, J., Sloane, A.M., When and how to develop domain specific language (2005) ACM Comuting Surveys (CSUR), 37 (4), pp. 316-344",,,"IEEE Indonesia","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2017 IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Computational Intelligence, CyberneticsCOM 2017","20 November 2017 through 22 November 2017",,135216,,9781538607831,,,"English","IEEE Int.

However, testing process is a time-consuming activity that requires good planning and a lot of resources. Therefore, technique and methodology for predicting the testing effort is important process prior the testing process to significantly increase efficiency of time, effort and cost usage. Correspond to software metric usage for measuring software quality, software metric can be used to identify the faulty modules in software. Furthermore, implementing machine learning technique will allow computer to 'learn' and able to predict the fault prone modules. Research in this field has become a hot issue for more than ten years ago. However, considering the high importance of software quality with support of machine learning methods development, this research area is still being highlighted until this year. In this paper, a survey of various software metric used for predicting software fault by using machine learning algorithm is examined. According to our review, this is the first study of software fault prediction that focuses to PROMISE repository dataset usage. Some conducted experiments from PROMISE repository dataset are compared to contribute a consensus on what constitute effective software metrics and machine learning method in software fault prediction. © 2017 IEEE.","machine learning algorithm; software defect prediction; Software metric; software testing","Artificial intelligence; Computer software selection and evaluation; Forecasting; Learning systems; Life cycle; Software design; Software testing; Fault-prone modules; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Machine learning techniques; Software defect prediction; Software development life cycle; Software fault prediction; Software metrices; Learning algorithms",,,,,,,,"Kumar, L., Krishna, S., Sureka, A., Ku, S., Effective fault prediction model developed using Least (2017) Square Support; Kumudha, P., Venkatesan, R., Cost-sensitive radial basis function neural network classifier for software (2016) Defect Prediction, 2016; Malhotra, R., Jain, A., Fault prediction using statistical and machine learning methods for improving software quality (2012) J.

The resemblance value of those documents will be compared based on the percentage of its word resemblance. The similarity value will help to detect plagiarism in documents. Methods used in this application are winnowing algorithm and web-based k-gram. We evaluate the accuracy of the system by comparing the system result with the human result. The differences between the systems and the respondents are 7% with k-gram 25 and 4% with k-gram 20. Moreover, processing time of our application are also discussed. © 2017 IEEE.","k-gram method; plagiarism detection; rabin karp; winnowing algorithm","Artificial intelligence; Websites; Plagiarism detection; Processing time; rabin karp; Web based; Web-based softwares; Intellectual property",,,,,,,,"Berners-Lee, T., Dimitroyannis, D., Mallinckrodt, A.J., McKay, S., World wide web (1994) Comput.

Community colleges and schools seek to complement the traditional teaching system with e-learning systems. However, we found there are differences in individual learning styles in terms of speed and learning styles. Serving or teaching students with one mechanism of the same teaching method will ignore individual rights while reducing the meaning of education broadly from the humanity dimension. Such situations will affect the target of increasing competence, the growth of knowledge and the value expected for some individuals to fail. The electronic learning model then undergoes a shift away from a mere system, now evolving into a personalized learning model, where learning processes are oriented toward the students' abilities. Under these conditions, models and other techniques are needed to help personalized adaptive learning as they need it. The purpose of this study was to identify the general criteria of personalized electronic learning model to meet the needs, interests and objectives of the learner in a more personal sense in a broader sense. This research was conducted through literature study on papers published in the last five years (2012-2017). The results show the common components, techniques or tools that are commonly used, as well as the support of the theoretical basis used as the platform for the development of a personalized e-learning model. © 2017 IEEE.","Architecture; Component; E-learning; Framework; Model; Personalized","Architecture; Developing countries; Education computing; Information management; Learning systems; Models; Teaching; Component; Framework; Information technology application; Personalized; Personalized e-learning; Personalized learning; Systematic literature review; Traditional teachings; E-learning",,,,,,,,"Wan, S., Niu, Z., A learner oriented learning recommendation approach based on mixed concept mapping and immune algorithm (2016) Knowledge-Based Syst., 103, pp. 28-40; Laksitowening, K.A., Hasibuan, Z.A., Personalized e-learning architecture in standard-based education (2015) Proc.-2015 Int.

This application will map the poverty levels of the water from 8,576 villages, 573 subdistricts and 35 regencies in Central Java by using the technique of spatial data mining and the approach of the water poverty index (WPI). Seeing the magnitude of that application scope, then it needs to do the software complexity measurement to find out further the resources needed for the development of the system in the future. The measurement of the software complexity is held with the Function Point (FP) method that produces the estimation of the resource requirements such as project work effort, project duration and speed of delivery. The results of the research showed that the software water poverty mapping owns the complexity level with FP at 136.64, the project work effort at 1,273 hours, the project duration in 4.037 months and the speed of delivery at 33.85 FP per person month. © 2017 IEEE.","Function point analysis; Software complexity measurement.; Water poverty mapping","Computer software; Data mining; Decision making; Java programming language; Mapping; Complexity levels; Function point analysis; Mapping applications; Poverty mappings; Resource requirements; Software complexity; Spatial data mining; Water poverty indices; Application programs",,,,,,,,"Saptono, P., (2013) Kualitas Air Baku di Jawa Tengah Merosot Suara Karya Newspaper, 18 January; (2006) Palgrave Macmillan.

A wide variety of calculation methods have been widely used to estimate the size of the software, one of which is by using Function Point Analysis (FPA). Volume calculation software based on a scale of complexity. Since the point of measurement is highly subjective, in order to maintain consistency and validity of the results, the method should be run by an experienced professional. This method is then applied by the authors to measure the complexity of academic information system STIKOM Dinamika Bangsa Jambi using structured modeling approach. Measurements were performed in this study consisted of depictions information system is built into the structure. Which is then analyzed by counting models Crude Function Points (CRP), the relative complexity of Adjustment Factor (RCAF), and then calculate the point function. From the results of calculations using the FPA to software quality measurement academic system STIKOM Dinamika Bangsa Jambi obtained value FP 166.32 is good. Function point value produced will be used by developers in determining the price and the cost of software systems to be built or developed. © 2017 IEEE.","Function point analysis; Software quality measurement; Structural model; System","Computer software; Computer software selection and evaluation; Information systems; Information use; Software design; Function point analysis; Measurement quality; Point of measurement; Relative complexity; Software Quality; Structural modeling; System; Volume calculation; Quality control",,,,,,,,"Borade, J.G., (2013) International Journal of Advanced Research in Software Project Effort and Cost Estimation Techniques, 3 (8), pp. 730-739; Gaol, F.L., Soewito, B., Leslie, H., Spits, H., (2016) Object Oriented Metrics to measure the quality of software study case Request online System; Lee, M., Chang, T., (2013) Software Measurement and Software Metrics in Software Quality, 7 (4), pp. 15-34; Sadiq, M., Asim, M., Ahmed, J., Kumar, V., Khan, S., (2011) Prediction of Software Project Effort Estimation: A Case Study, 1 (1), pp. 37-43; Srinivasan, K.P., (2015) Unique Fundamentals of Software Measuremant And Software Metrics, 7 (4), pp. 29-43; Pratiwi, D., Pratiwi, D., (2013) Implementation of Function Point Analysis in Measuring the Volume Estimation of Software System in Object Oriented, , Implementation of Function Point Analysis in Measuring the Volume Estimation of Software System in Object Oriented and Structural Model of Academic System no.

In terms of purpose, game has two types, which is serious game and non-serious game. As learning media, serious games need to have ability to motivate its player in order to play the game until the end so the player can finish the game while understanding learning materials given in the game. Therefore, the quality of serious game should be measured, like any other software. When it comes to measure serious games, previous models can't do the job well since all of them have no way to measure the game's content, especially to measure the content that can improve player's motivation. This paper proposes a new game measurement metric to measure the game quality factors, especially to measure serious game contents that can motivate its players. The result of this paper is a metric table consisted of measureable factors and type of test to measure them. © 2017 IEEE.","Motivational factors; Quality factors; Quality measurement; Quality metric; Serious games","Computer games; Human computer interaction; Game contents; Learning materials; Learning media; Motivational factors; Quality factors; Quality measurements; Quality metrices; Video game; Serious games",,,,,,,,"Trisnadoli, A., Hendradjaya, B., Sunindyo, W.D., A proposal of quality model for mobile games (2015) 5th Int.

Obviously, voters' decisions are influenced by human nature characteristic which like to similarity preferences, where human like to choose someone who have full or frequent similarity in profile and/or program. Beforehand, voters should do learning by doing the characterization of their and candidate couples' profile and program. Afterwards, based on candidate couples' profile and program, the voters will do discrimination between candidate couples, classification, clustering or association among candidate couples.

Task ranking is one of the problems that can be solved by using a machine learning algorithm ranking problem. This work focuses on finding the right approach and corresponding algorithms in the process of ranking to be able to help people in determining which jobs have a higher priority than others. Our approach is to compare several algorithms performed in the process of ranking that are Bipartite Ranking, k-partite Ranking, and Ranking by pairwise comparison. We're used questionnaires and deployment of prototype of Intelligent Personal Assistant Agent to apply the appropriate algorithm in intelligence agent in arranging task priority in daily activity that must be done by the users. After training dataset and evaluate the validation dataset using NDCG, it is found that the collaborative ranking used have a more accurate value / lower variance test evaluation because it uses a large dataset and smaller training dataset.

The problems of public transportation are in the facility which is still inappropriate, unclear information, uncomfortable, bad accessibility of public transportation which take more time to reach the destination, more complicated than taking the private transportation, and about the society, people don’t want to be labeled as low-class level. This paper is representing how to make the better system for public transportation in Jakarta with smart integrated payment system. Aim of this system is to encourage people to use public transportation rather than private transportation. The payment system that proposed are using smartphone application by scanning the QR Code or using smart card. User can easily pay through application by scanning QR code to pay the public transportation. The proposed of this smart integrated payment system will have opportunity as profit when collaborate with business when they can advertise their business and get customer from our user. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Software reliability measurements are performed at every stage of software development process to evaluate whether the software reliability requirements has been fulfilled. In this paper proposed the new methods to measuring the software reliability based on categorize faults. We use J.D Musa-III failure datasets are divided into 5 modules to measure software reliability using our method. Base on J.D Musa-III datasets we got the value of reliability is 0.7416 or 74%. The software reliability can be measured using this method and the future work is to categorize the failure of the software based on the source of its failure. © 2017 IEEE.","fault; matrix; measured; software reliability","Computer software selection and evaluation; Faulting; Matrix algebra; Software design; Failure intensity; Free software; measured; Operating periods; Software development process; Software Quality; Software reliability measurements; Time-periods; Software reliability",,,,,,,,"Nanda, S.S., Soewito, B., Modeling software effort estimation using hybrid pso-ANFIS (2016) 2016 International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications (ISITIA, pp. 219-224. , Lombok; Ryan, R., Gaol, F.L., Service oriented architecture governance implementation in a software development project as an enterprise solutions (2013) Journal of Computer Science, 9 (12), p. 1638; Börcsök, J., (2004) Electronic Safety Systems, Hardware Concepts, Models, and Calculation, , Heidelberg, Germany; Pai, Ganesh, J., (2013) A Survey of Software Reliability Models., , arXiv preprint 1304.4539; Iskandar, K., Gaol, F.L., Soewito, B., Hendric Spits Warnars, H.L., Software size measurement of knowledge management portal with use case point The International Conference on Computer, Control, Informatics, and Its Applications (IC3INA 2016, , 3-5 Oct 2016, Tangerang, Indonesia; Musa, J.D., More reliable software faster and cheaper (2004) Software Reliability Engineering ,United States of America; Schneidewind, N.F., Minimizing risk in applying metrics on multiple projects (1992) Proc.

However, formula definition is often considered correct after tested with only one or few inputs. This may be fine with simple formula, but for more complex ones, more testings should be performed, in order to prevent solution that riddled with errors. However, writing a formula test case in spreadsheet software is not a simple task, mainly because there is no standard way to do that. In this paper, a simple spreadsheet test case application is proposed. User can define a formula, with many input variants, along with expected results. After that, application will generate a spreadsheet document, with all the needed contents for testing, along with test result. That way, user may re-check the formula and make necessary modifications (then run the test, again). Using this method, a formula can be tested first, with many input as needed, before it put in real document. All of these will impact in more productive programmers, with less time spent for debugging. © 2016 IEEE.","end-user programming; end-user software engineering; formula; spreadsheet; spreadsheet test case; testing","Application programs; Computer programming; Software engineering; Spreadsheets; Testing; End user programming; End-user software engineering; formula; Spreadsheet software; Test case; Time spent; Software testing",,,,,,,,"Abraham, R., Erwig, M., GoalDebug: A spreadsheet debugger for end users (2007) Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 251-260. , IEEE Computer Society, May; Abraham, R., Erwig, M., UCheck: A spreadsheet type checker for end users (2007) Journal of Visual Languages & Computing, 18 (1), pp. 71-95; Antoniu, T., Steckler, P.A., Krishnamurthi, S., Neuwirth, E., Felleisen, M., Validating the unit correctness of spreadsheet programs (2004) Software Engineering, 2004, ICSE 2004.

Education is now very depending with technology and always keeps evolving to support each other. Teaching methods are now drastically change because the present of rapid development of technology. The way of teaching is now shifting due to the available technology and the students, parents and the society no longer accept the conventional teaching method, which is one-way communication.

AOI-HEP is success to mine 3 and 1 similar patterns from IPUMS and breast cancer UCI machine learning datasets respectively. Meanwhile, the experiments showed that there was no finding similar patterns on adult and census UCI machine learning datasets. The experiments showed that finding AOI-HEP similar pattern in dataset is influenced by learning on chosen high level concept attribute in concept hierarchy and it is applied to AOI-HEP frequent pattern in previous research as well. The experiments chosed high level concept attributes such as workclass, clump thickness, means and marts for adult, breast cancer, census and IPUMS datasets respectively. In order to proof that the chosen high level concept attribute will influences the AOI-HEP similar pattern in dataset, then extended experiments were carried on and the finding were census dataset which had been none AOI-HEP similar pattern, had AOI-HEP similar pattern when learned on high level concept in marital attribute. Meanwhile, Breast cancer which had been had 1 AOI-HEP similar pattern, had none AOI-HEP similar pattern when learned on high level concept in attributes such as cell size, cell shape and bare nuclei.

In the future by integrating these data with existing SCADA system, controlling and regulating the electric power system is expected to be more accurate. In this study the response time assessment of algorithm for analysing PMU data using Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) and Prony Analysis is conducted to determine which method has more advantage for using in real time PMU data.

Higher education as a place to educate and share knowledge has to realize these phenomena. With social media, organization supports the knowledge sharing process within organization. Then it changes learning mechanism from e-learning into social learning environment. According to this fact, this research will combine the concepts of knowledge management and social learning as a model framework's component by identifying the significant factors and its relationship with social media. A systematic and relevant literature review from journals and textbooks was conducted to support the development of component framework model. As the result, we propose an integrated model of knowledge management with social learning for higher education. © 2016 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.","E-learning; Higher education; Knowledge management;

The AOI-HEP application is implemented as a hybrid between AOI characteristic rule mining and HEP algorithms. AOI-HEP combines the powerful features of AOI and EP by using concept hierarchy in AOI to generalize into high level data and applying growth rates in EP and produces powerful discrimination for high level data. AOI-HEP can be implemented to discriminate datasets such as finding bad and good customers for banking loan systems or credit card applicants and etc. Meanwhile, AOI-HEP can be implemented to mine similar patterns such as similar customer loan patterns or similar customer credit card rating and etc. Since AOI-HEP is a new data mining technique, then future research can be explored such as inverse discovery learning, learning more than two datasets, learning other knowledge rules and etc. AOI-HEP future research will give research idea for data mining researchers community particularly for bachelor and master degree students.

This paper will explain how AOI-HEP mining technique can be used to mine frequent pattern. AOI-HEP is influenced by Attribute Oriented Induction (AOI) and Emerging Pattern (EP) mining techniques by applying AOI characteristic rule algorithm and improvement EP growth rate. The experiment used adult dataset from UCI machine learning repository with 48842 instances, run in 3 seconds and the instances were discriminated between government and non government concepts based on learning on workclass attribute. AOI-HEP mining interest for frequent pattern will be influenced by learning on their chosen attribute. The experiments showed that adult dataset which learn on workclass attribute had AOI-HEP mining interest for frequent pattern and there are four frequent patterns which have strong discrimination rule. Meanwhile, extended experiments upon adult dataset which learn on marital-status attribute showed there is no AOI-HEP mining interest for frequent pattern. © 2014 IEEE.","AOI-HEP; Attribute Oriented Induction; Data Mining; Emerging pattern; High Level Emerging Pattern","Artificial intelligence; Experiments; Learning systems; AOI-HEP; Attribute oriented induction; Emerging patterns; Extended versions; Mining techniques; Rule algorithms; UCI machine learning repository; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Warnars, S., Attribute oriented induction of high-level emerging patterns (2012) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing (IEEE GrC), pp. 525-530. , Hangzhou, China, 11-13 August; Muyeba, M.K., Khan, M.S., Warnars, S., Keane, J., A framework to mine high-level emerging patterns by attribute-oriented induction (2011) Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning (IDEAL'11), pp. 170-177. , Norwich, United Kingdom, 7-9 September; Han, J., Cheng, H., Xin, D., Yan, X., Frequent pattern mining: Current status and future directions (2007) Data Min Knowl Disc, 15 (1), pp. 55-86; Han, J., Pei, J., Yin, Y., Mao, R., Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation: A frequent-pattern tree approach (2004) Data Min.

Emerging Pattern (EP) algorithms discover emerging patterns between datasets but mostly consider low-level data. This paper introduces an algorithm, AOI-HEP, derived from both AOI and High-level Emerging Patterns (HEP), where HEP discriminates the high level data from AOI. The main objective is to discover characteristic HEP patterns using AOI. To filter out the large overlapping and subsuming attribute values in the output, a Cartesian product of attribute values, a similarity metric based on attribute values and attribute hierarchy level are applied. Experiments used four datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. Results show that various interesting HEP patterns can be generated by using the AOI-HEP algorithm. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Attribute oriented induction; Attribute values; Cartesian Products; Emerging patterns; Similarity metrics; UCI machine learning repository; Granular computing; Algorithms",,,,,,,,"Han, L., Cai, Y., Cercone, N., Knowledge discovery in databases: An attribute-oriented approach Proceedings of the 1 8th International Conference Very Large Data Bases, 1 (992), pp. 547-559; Cheung, D.W., Hwang, H.Y., Fu, A.W., Han, L., Eflicient rule-based attribute-oriented induction for data mining (2000) Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, 15 (2), pp. 175-1200; Dong, G., Li, L., Eflicient mining of emerging patterns: Discovering trends and differences (1999) Proceedings of the 5th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 43-52; Dong, G., Li, L., Mining border description of emerging patterns from dataset pairs (2005) Journal of Knowledge and Information Systems, 8, pp. 2178-1202; Muyeba, M.K., Khan, M.S., Warnars, S., Keane, J.A., A framework to mine high-level emerging patterns by attribute-oriented induction (2011) Proceedings of the 1 2th International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning, 1, pp. 70-77; Stepinski, T.F., Ding, W., Eick, C.F., Controlling patterns of geospatial phenomena (2011) Journal Geoinformatica, 15 (3), pp. 399-416; Chen, Y.L., Wu, Y.Y., Chang, R., From data to global generalized knowledge (2012) Decision Support Systems, 52 (2), pp. 295-307; Wu, Y.Y., Chen, Y.L., Chang, R., Mining negative generalized knowledge from relational databases (2011) Knowledge-Based Systems, 24 (1), pp. 134-145; Muyeba, M.K., Crockett, K., Keane, J.A., A hybrid interestingness heuristic approach for attribute-oriented mining (2011) Proceedings of the 5th KES International Conference on Agent and Multi-agent Systems: Technologies and Applications (KES-AMST a'Ii, pp. 414-424; Huang, S., Wang, L., Wang, W., Adopting data mining techniques on the recommendations of the library collections (2011) Proceedings of the 11 Th International Conference on Information and Knowledge Engineering, pp. 46-52; Piao, M., Lee, L.B., Shon, H.S., Yun, U., Ryu, K.H., Enumeration tree based emerging patterns mining by using two different supports (2011) Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Infonnation Technology (lchit'Ii, pp. 708-715; Tzanis, G., Kavakiotis, I., Vlahavas, I.P., PolyA-iEP: A data mining method for the effective prediction of polyadenylation sites (2011) Expert Syst.

Generally, growth rate based on low-level data and simple supports are used to measure emerging patterns (EP) from one dataset to another. This consequently leads to numerous EPs because of the large numbers of items. We propose an approach that uses high-level data: high-level data captures the data semantics of a collection of attributes values by using taxonomies, and always has larger support than low-level data. We apply a well known algorithm, attribute-oriented induction (AOI), that generalises attributes using taxonomies and investigate properties of the rule sets obtained by generalisation algorithms. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","algorithm; attribute-oriented; emerging pattern; high-level; rulesets","Attribute oriented induction; attribute-oriented; Data semantics; Data sets; emerging pattern; Emerging patterns; Generalisation; high-level; Rule set; rulesets; Simple support; Attribute oriented induction; Attribute-oriented; Data semantics; Emerging patterns; Generalisation; High-level; Rulesets; Simple support; Semantics; Taxonomies; Algorithms; Semantics; Algorithms; Taxonomies",,,,,,,,"Dong, G., Li, J., Efficient mining of emerging patterns: Discovering trends and differences Proceedings of the Fifth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, San Diego, California, United States, August 15-18 (1999); Gago, P., Bento, C., A Metric for Selection of the Most Promising Rules (1998) LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, (1510), pp. 19-27. , Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery; Han, J., Cercone, N., Cai, Y., Attribute-Oriented Induction in Relational Databases (1991) Knowledge Discovery in Databases, pp. 213-228. , Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Frawley, W.J.

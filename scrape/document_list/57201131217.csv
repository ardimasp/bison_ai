Therefore, the quality of the network is becomes very important. There are several protocol and technology in the Internet network. In this paper we analyzed Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) compared to Non MPLS. We compared the throughput, packet loss, and Jitter. We used the tools such as Iperf, Wireshark and routing table to do simulation and take the data. The result show the MPLS technology has better result compared to Non MPLS. The throughput is 82.5 Mbit/sec compared to 70 Mbit/sec. The packet loss is 0.4% compared to 1%. Both of technology had the jitter less than 50 ms. We concluded that quality network using MPLS can be increase compared to Non MPLS. © 2017 IEEE.","MPLS; Multiprotocol label switching; Network quality; Routing","Industrial research; Jitter; Packet loss; Packet networks; Daily lives; Network qualities; Routing; Routing table; Several protocols; Wireshark; multi-protocol label switching",,,,,"(2014) MPLS WAN Technology Design Guide, , Cisco Cisco Press; Vivick, A., (2002) Advanced MPLS Design and Implementation USA, , Cisco Press; Osborne, E., Simha, A., (2012) Traffic Engineering with MPLS, , Cisco Press.

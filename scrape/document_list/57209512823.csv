Electronic learning (e-learning) using Internet and digital technologies to create experience in educating others. E-Learning in STMIK Mikroskil used to help students and lecturers in teaching and learning process. This study uses the UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) model. The aim is to analyze the tendency of users of e-learning systems at STMIK Mikroskil Medan, by testing whether Behavioral Intention and Behavior to Use a technology are influenced by Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, and Facilitating Conditions. These four factors are moderated by gender, experience, and voluntary factors. Questionnaire data were collected from 346 active students and analyzed by structural equation modeling (SEM) using AMOS 24. The results of this study showed Performance Expectation Factors, Effort Expectation Factors, Social Influence Factors had a positive effect on Behavioral Intention, Facilitating Conditions Factors had a positive effect on Use Behavior, Behavioral Intention has a significant influence on Use Behavior. Gender does not have a moderating effect that affects the factors of Performance Expectation and Effort Expectancy on Behavioral Intention, but Gender has a moderating effect that affects Social Influence factors towards Behavioral Intention. Experience does not have a moderating effect that influences Business Expectancy factors on Behavioral Intention. However, experience has a moderating effect that influences Social Influence factors that have a positive effect on Behavioral Intention. Experience also has a moderating effect that affects the Facilitating Conditions factor for Use Behavior. Voluntariness has a moderating effect that affects Social Influence factors towards Behavioral Intention. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","E-Learning; Effort Expectancy; Facilitating Conditions; Performance Expectancy; Social Influence; Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)",,,,,,"Venkatesh, V., Morris, M.G., Davis, G.B., Davis, F.D., User Acceptance of Information Technology: Toward a Unified View, MIS Q (2003) Int.

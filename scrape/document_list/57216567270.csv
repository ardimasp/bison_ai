It can minimize the effort in software development to adjust and adapt the changes in business processes. In this study, we used SOA and Micro Services Concept to integrate applications for front end and back end mechanism. X is a company engaged in online healthcare and Y is a subsidiary of company X which also acts as a vendor and contributes to the supply of products. In this study, we propose the integration of these two separate applications using the service-oriented architecture concept. SOA concept can support the integration in various platform application in information systems between many organizations. We also used micro services concept to identify and analyze the list of micro services needed. In the result, we proposed reusable services, Restful web services architecture, API endpoint in micro services, and list of micro services. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

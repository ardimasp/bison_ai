An Integrated System is needed to provide the value of competence in the technology and information systems that companies use in their business processes. The development stage starts from the assessment and understanding of the current situation both in the business environment and the IS/IT environment. The business environment includes the internal business environment and external business environment.Similarly, the IS/IT environment which includes internal and external IS/IT environments. With a deep understanding of current conditions, it can be determined the Information System(IS) strategy, Information Technology(IT) strategy and future IS/IT strategies. This study reveals the following results: The absence of good system integration with the business units involved makes the company in a weak position. But in terms of opportunity is quite high so that the use of technology and information systems that fit business needs is recommended in this study. The results of this study recommends some applications that can solve problems commonly experienced by companies such as system integration and business process automation to achieve more efficient and effective business processes. © 2020 F.

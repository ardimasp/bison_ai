Indonesia, as one of the trade partners of China, should increase the quality and quantity of cooperation with China. In supporting the goal, it requires an ample of human resources ability that is active in socialization, diplomacy, and cooperation establishment with China. The cooperation can be established by mastering of Mandarin. The Department of International Relations realized the situation and complemented its students with foreign language skill such as Mandarin. Based on the evaluation of Chinese learning outcomes to 31 sophomore students, the biggest obstacle of students is to compose a sentence based on vocabularies learned. Researchers designed mobile learning as a tool in learning Mandarin. Therefore, this research offers solutions to assist students in mastering the sentences forming in Mandarin through mobile learning. © 2017 IEEE.","evaluation; language; Mandarin; mobile learning","Commerce; Data communication systems; E-learning; evaluation; Foreign language; International relations; language; Learning outcome; Mandarin; Mobile Learning; Third-world countries; Students",,,,,"Mursitama, T.N., Yudono, M., Panjaitan, A., (2013) Dinamika Diplomasi Ekonomi di Asia, , Jakarta: Kepik Ungu; Godfrey, C., The influence of Chinese culture on learning Chinese as a second language: A case study of Zimbabwean students learning Chinese as a second language (2015) International Journal of Language and Linguistics, 3 (2), pp. 33-39; Pearson, L., (2014) The Foundations of Teaching Chinese As A Foreign Language: An Investigation of Late 19th Century Textbooks, , http://scholarworks.umass.edu/theses/1076, Masters Theses 1896-February; Ying, Y., Mursitama, T.N., Illuminative approach in evaluation of curriculum of Chinese literature department (2017) Adv.

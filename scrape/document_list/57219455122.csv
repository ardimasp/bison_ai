Games with the right presentation can train the brain as a whole. This research is focused on High-Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) in order to be able to train the brain's ability in players. Can be concluded that the Web scoreboard with Hypertext Prepocessor (PHP) and Structured Query Language (SQL) has been successfully developed. Web consists of three main menus namely the home menu, score menu, contact menu. unity code accessed to a web page to get data from a web server.

Virtual reality (VR) and machine learning technologies, such as deep learning (DL) application, are promising diagnostic tools for ADHD in the near future because VR provides stimuli to replace real stimuli and recreate experiences with high realism. It also creates a playful virtual environment and reduces stress in children. The DL model is a subset of machine learning that can transform input and output data into diagnostic values using convolutional neural network systems. By using a sensitive and specific ADHD-VR diagnostic tool prototype for children with DL model, ADHD can be diagnosed more easily and accurately, especially in places with few mental health resources or where tele-consultation is possible. To date, several virtual reality-continuous performance test (VR-CPT) diagnostic tools have been developed for ADHD; however, they do not include a machine learning or deep learning application. A diagnostic tool development study needs a trustworthy and applicable study design and conduct to ensure the completeness and transparency of the report of the accuracy of the diagnostic tool. The proposed four-step method is a mixed-method research design that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches to reduce bias and collect essential information to ensure the trustworthiness and relevance of the study findings. Therefore, this study aimed to present a brief review of a ADHD-VR digital game diagnostic tool prototype with a DL model for children and the proposed four-step method for its development. © Copyright © 2020 Wiguna, Wigantara, Ismail, Kaligis, Minayati, Bahana and Dirgantoro.","attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; diagnostic tool; digital game; Indonesia; machine learning; neuropsychological test; virtual reality","Article; attention deficit disorder; child; child psychiatry; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; digital game; game; human; Indonesia; machine learning; neuropsychological test; qualitative research; quantitative study; statistical bias; trust; virtual reality",,,,,"The Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Division, Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia ?

However, sometimes there are situations where no one can accompany, especially if they are going out so that the person is out of control. Time limitations are often seen as the main cause of the absence of people accompanying them, so the availability of a system that can detect human activities or falls automatically becomes very important. Pervasive computing implemented by using smartphone can improve the quality of service by monitoring the user. Pervasive health monitory system provides activity detection and activity monitoring features to help user to see their activity profile, give suggestion to user, and notify the family or caretaker if the user fallen or show unusual activity.

For building a supervised machine learning to predict cardiovascular disease risk, a best classifier is tested and selected to fit with the model data. In selecting the best classifier model, five classifiers were used to train the data. In this process, each classifier used sixty thousand medical records from Mayapada private hospital for data training and testing. The data was initially divided into 38 attributes. The training model of each classifier was measured and evaluated using classification accuracy, classification error and F-measurement. As a result, Gradient Boosted Trees classifier was selected as the best classifier with the highest accuracy rate more than 80%, F-measure is more than 92% and the classification error is less than 12%. Hence, a backend machine learning API was built based on this Gradient Boosted Trees classifier and it has been tested for training and predicting the cardiovascular disease risk through the Postman application. © 2020 ISSN 1881-803X.","API (Application Programming Interface); Classifier; Supervised machine learning",,,,,,"Acknowledgment.

It is still considered a very important preventive measure of cardiovascular disease as it gives a significant impact to reducing mortality rates and cardiovascular events. Prior to developing a prediction model of cardiovascular risk, identification of dominant predictor variables is very crucial. Some prominent studies have proposed a vast number of predictor variables. Although some predictor variables might be universal in nature, as the premise of this study, some of the variables might be associated with local lifestyle that governs patient behavior. This paper presents a verificative study on previous studies predicting cardiovascular risk level by using Indonesian adult patients’ lab records as the input dataset. In relation to this objective, this study aimed to select dominant biochemical indicators as predictor variables and trained machine learning models as classifier. Finally, this study compared the performance of several prominent classifier models such as: XGBoost, Random Forest, k-NN, Gradient Boosting, Artificial Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron), Decision Tree, and Ada Boost. The results show that: XGBoost model achieved the best training and testing accuracy (0.965 and 0.964) compared to Random Forest (0.964 and 0.962), 5-NN (0.952 and 0.948), Gradient Boosting (0.948 and 0.940), Artificial Neural Networks (0.945 and 0.933), Decision Tree (0.861 and 0.860) and Ada Boost models (0.748 and 0.718). © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cardiovascular risk prediction; Machine learning","Data mining; Database systems; Decision trees; Forecasting; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Biochemical indicators; Cardio-vascular disease; Cardiovascular event; Cardiovascular risk; Machine learning models; Predictor variables; Preventive measures; Training and testing; Machine learning",,,,,,"Rovio, S.P., Cardiovascular risk factors from childhood and midlife cognitive performance: the Young Finns Study (2017) J.

Usually, patients come to hospitals or clinics to have their vitiligo conditions assessed. This can be very tiring to the patients, as vitiligo treatments usually take a relatively long period of time, which can range from months to years. To address this challenge, we present in this paper a prototype of an Android-based mobile application called Vi-DA, which stands for Vitiligo Diagnostic Assistance. Vi-DA consists of three subsystems, which are user sign-up subsystem, camera and image analysis subsystem, and progress report subsystem. The mobile application was developed in Java programming language and uses MySQL as the database system. Vi-DA adopts a vitiligo segmentation algorithm to segment input image into normal skin area, vitiligo skin area, and non-skin area. Results showed that Vi-DA gave comparable results to the previous system implemented in Matlab. User acceptance testing results also showed that all respondents agreed on the usefulness of the system and agreed to use Vi-DA again in the future. Vi-DA benefits both dermatologists and patients as not only a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tool but also as a smart application that can be used for self-assessment at home. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Acceptance tests; Computer aided diagnosis; Dermatology; Image segmentation; MATLAB; Medical computing; Mobile computing; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Mobile applications; Progress report; Segmentation algorithms; Self assessment; Skin disorders; Smart applications; User acceptance testing; Computer systems programming",,,,,,"(2017) What Is Vitiligo?, , http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Vitiligo/vitiligo_ff.asp, National Institute of Arthritis Musculoskeletal Skin Diseases [Online]; Kochmann, M., Locatis, C., Telemedicine in the Apple App Store: An Exploratory Study of Teledermatology Apps (2016) Proc. of the Int.

In recent years there have been several studies that have used games, especially computer-based ones to improve the executive function of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) especially in working memory improvements. There are still several obstacles in using computer-based games that have been circulating today in Indonesia. The aim of this research is to develop and create a prototype game that can be used to improve working memory of children with ADHD using Bahasa Indonesia. The prototype game application is a race game with matching colors and memory work tasks; developed using Construct2. Players will play as a driver, delivering certain fruits to specific homes with different colors. The game also included visuospatial tasks such as remembering the objects. For performance test, CPU utilization, average FPS and image memory usage has been tested in several browsers. In conclusion, the performance tests results show that the first type of the prototype game is good enough to be played in desktop or laptop. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Software prototyping; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; CPU utilization; Executive function; Game for children; Image memory; Performance tests; Work task; Working memory; Computer games",,,,,,"https://newzoo.com/about, Newzoo [Internet].

Using this plug-in, the author will implement the algorithm to improve the visual effect performance. As the number of the games developed by Indonesian developers are gradually increasing especially on these last few years, the quality is not looked as good as the quantity. For performance issues, Unity Particle Playground is an asset plug-in purchasable on the unity asset store. However, it does not solve the problem for the performance issue that developer encounter. As for this research, an entirely new solution is used to increase the game performance. A Bezier curve with extruded Mesh is used to replace the main use of Unity Shuriken Particle System. As the biggest particle visual effect gets replaced by the mesh implementation, the performance will be improved significantly. Overall, the end result is quite satisfying. Performance wise, it is improved a lot, the lag issues has been reduced. The usage of the plug-in is also straightforward; the only obstacle is the resources use is using sprite sheets.

Some of these images are genuine, while some others have gone through modifications. Although the creation and posting of edited photographs in media are basically not prohibited, it becomes a problem when they are used improperly. Until now, the common practice in Indonesia when assessing whether an image has been modified or is original is still heavily dependent on human expert assessment that could be subjective. This research offers an alternative solution that is objective by developing a systematic image analysis method for distinguishing between original and modified image. The method utilizes high-level feature, namely the metadata of the image file, to differentiate between original and modified image. A prototype system was implemented in Visual Basic as a desktop application. The application used MS Windows GDI+. This prototype application can be used as a reliable and faster means to assist in fake image detection. However, as metadata-based analysis only detects whether a photograph has possibly been edited and it does not show which part of the photograph has been manipulated, future work includes development of pixel-based analysis approach. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Metadata; Photography; Alternative solutions; Analysis approach; Comparison study; Desktop applications; High-level features; Image analysis method; Image detection; Prototype system; Image analysis",,,,"Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Tinggi, DIKTI","This research is supported by DIKTI Hibah Bersaing research funding 2016.","Kaskus, (2014), Super-ngakak-meme-foto-syahrini-tiduran-di-padang-rumput-di-itali-yang-unyu- unyu Retrieved from http://www.kaskus.co.id/thread/53ce6cf45a5163b46f8b46f8/super-ngakak-meme-foto-syahrini-tiduran-di-padang-rumput-di-itali-yang-unyu-unyu/82; Indonesian Voices, G., (2015), http://www.globalindonesianvoices.com/18576/foto-mesra-ketua-kpk-abraham-samad-says-intimate-photos-with-elvira-devinamira-are-fake/; Forester, T., Morrison, P., (1994) Computer Ethics: Cautionary Tales and Ethical Dilemmas in Computing, , 2nd ed (Cambridge MA: MIT Press); (2007) Section 14: Best Practices for Image Authentication, , http://www.crime-scene-investigator.net/swgit-section14.pdf; Farid, H., (2009) A Survey of Image Forgery Detection IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 26 (2), pp. 16-25; Sencar, H., Memon, N., (2009) Overview of State-of-the-art in Digital Image Forensics Algorithms, Architectures and Information Systems Security, p. 325; Mahdian, B., Saic, S., A bibliography on blind methods for identifying image forgery (2010) Image Communication, 25, pp. 389-399; Mahdian, B., Saic, S., Nedbal, R., JPEG quantization table forensics: A statistical approach (2010) Proceedings of International Workshop on Computational Forensics, pp. 150-159; Kakar, P., Sudha, N., Ser, W., (2011) Exposing Digital Image Forgeries by Detecting Discrepancies in Motion Blur IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 13, pp. 443-452; Popescu, A.C., Farid, H., (2005) Exposing Digital Forgeries in Color Filter Array Interpolated Images IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 53, pp. 3948-3959; Kakar, P., Sudha, N., Authenticating image metadata elements using geolocation information and sun direction estimation (2012) Proceedings of International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME), pp. 236-241; Working Group, M., (2010) Guidelines for Handling Image Metadata v2.0., , http://www.metadataworkinggroup.org/specs/; http://imageforensic.org/, Ghiro [Software]; Kee, E., Johnson, M.K., Farid, H., (2011) Digital Image Authentication from JPEG Headers IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 6 (3), pp. 1066-1075; http://raymondbahana.blog.binusian.org/rekayasa-photo-i; http://raymondbahana.blog.binusian.org/rekayasa-photo-ii",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Computing and Applied Informatics, ICCAI 2016","14 December 2016 through 15 December 2016",,127044,17426588,,,,"English","J.

The same utilizes augmented reality (AR) technology and a cloud marker recognition system and allows creations of unique marker for each player without the need to do an update every time. Aetherpet is a virtual pet game designed to become a prototype in implementing augmented reality technology in mobile gaming. This application is developed for the Android platform and Vuforia library. The marker image generated from the application is converted into features; that can be detected on a grayscale marker image. The prototype result shows that augmented reality is possible to be implemented. There are only small restrictions on the implementation such as incompatibility of some features and requirement for a reliable server to handle the game information processing. © 2015 The Authors.

Living in an ever-evolving world, people and technology have become inseparable. One technology that is on the rise is Augmented Reality (AR), which combines the real world with virtual or computer-generated data. This research is based on developing a combination of jigsaw puzzles with AR (multiple marker-based) called Puzzlar, using FLARManager as an AR tool. The application also uses Adobe Flash (game design) and PHP. The uniqueness of the prototype program is in its use of 2D physical markers to represent 3D jigsaw puzzle pieces that are animated in the playing mode. In user acceptance testing (UAT), 70% of the testers were satisfied with the game play of Puzzlar. However, 30% of the testers thought that it could be improved. © 2006-2014 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","3D puzzle; Augmented reality; Game; Jigsaw puzzle; Puzzlar",,,,,,,"Finch, C., The Benefits of Jigsaw Puzzles: Jigsaws Can Educate, Stretch the Mind&Make a Great Gift.

The purpose of this research was to perform a comparative analysis of the stress value due to the live load calculation program based on the results of Midas/Civil with the field measurement results and stress sensors determine the effect of the modulus of elasticity of concrete parameters on the stress value of pre-stressed bridge. The method used in this research is the analytical calculations based on actual conditions measured in the field. Loading test method is based on the actual condition of the integrated load testing methods. The results obtained in this research is when the load works right on top of the bridge girder then the stress value will be close to the actual stress value. In the effect analysis of the modulus of elasticity of concrete shows that the modulus does not affect the stress value. Moreover, on the diaphragm modeling workload which is right on top of the girder has less stress value. Therefore, it can be concluded that the program modeling results approaches with the actual conditions in the field, where the field measurements results are relatively the same compared to the results of the calculation program. © Research India Publications.","Bridge stress value; MIDAS civil; Modulus of Elasticity; Prestressed bridge",,,,,,"(2008) ST350 Strain Transducer Instruction Manual, , Canada: Camphbell Scientific, Inc; Chen, W.F., Duan, L., (2000) Bridge Engineering Handbook, , London: Boca Raton; Perencanaan Struktur Beton Untuk Jembatan (Concrete Design for Bridge Structure), , Department of Public Works; Standar Pembebanan Untuk Jembatan (Standard of Loading for Bridge Structure), , Department of Public Works; Perencanaan Struktur Beton Pratekan Untuk Jembatan (Design Presstressed Concrete for Bridge Structure), , Bina Marga, Department of Public Works","Hidayat, I.; Civil Engineering Departement, Bina Nusantara UniversityIndonesia",,,"Research India Publications",,,,,09734562,,,,"English","Int.

It makes a lot of things in various fields including education becoming more effective and efficient. In education, one of its implementation which is a game is proven to be a useful tool to support conventional teaching methods and bring a more natural understanding of learning materials. Moreover, as a product of the popular culture in modern society, video game mirrors the general culture practice in real life and reflects it via its own culture inside the game. This makes a video game can give a contribution to the social construction of reality as it affects the player's view towards learning in real life and vice versa. From there, we see that there is an opportunity for learning about religion to be supported by its utilization to provide an interactive and fun learning experience. In this paper, we discuss how a video game is implemented to support religious learning. The game was developed with the scrum method where we surveyed to gather the user requirements before the design step. The game design was made by using the use case diagram and storyboard, and it was built using Unity version 2017.3.0f3. © 2019 IEEE.","Game; Mobile game; religion Game; religious Video Game; Serious Game","Human computer interaction; Information and technologies; Learning experiences; Learning materials; Popular cultures; Social constructions; Teaching methods; Use case diagram; User requirements; Engineering education",,,,,"Li, S.D., Familial religiosity, family processes, and juvenile delinquency in a national sample of early adolescents (2013) The Journal of Early Adolescence, 34, pp. 436-462. , 2013; Gockel, A., Burton, D., Can god help?

Currently, gamification method is widely applied in the world of education. Gamification learning method means applying of a game into the learning process, with the aim to foster motivation to learn and change student behavior. It makes teachers more creative in designing the learning process. Some of the developers have learned more about psychology science or other sciences that study human motivation and behavior. The aim is to motivate students in the learning process and maximizing feelings of enjoyment and involvement with the learning process, besides this media can be used to capture the things that interest students and inspire them to keep learning. This study aims to propose a gamification model that are flexible in LMS, have good performance and can be improved student performance in their study. © 2019 IEEE.","Education; Gamification; Learning Management System","Behavioral research; Education; Education computing; Motivation; Students; Game industry; Gamification; Innovative learning; Learning management system; Learning methods; Learning process; Student behavior; Student performance; Learning systems",,,,,,"Kolekar, S.V., Pai, R.M., Manohara Pai, M.M., Adaptive User Interface for Moodle based E-learning System using Learning Styles (2018) Procedia.

Even though, Jakarta city is implementing the smart city concept. Smart city is a dream for every city in the world because it makes the city more effective, efficient, and worth living by implementing technology. Therefore, Jakarta have to be able to pay attention with the problems that is arise along with the rapid of technology by changing dynamically. One of the technology development that can answer the challenges of Jakarta city is drone. Drone utilization has brings a lot of benefits to be implemented in smart city.

The development of a transportation system is still very much needed, which must be based on a comprehensive analysis and systemic approach. The application of planning standards and implementation standards and transport regulations must be firm and indiscriminate. The integrated mass public transportation system must become essential to overwhelm the problems by implementing IoT. IoT opportunities are very extraordinary can be developed for the benefit to the community. Thus, it means promises a lucrative market share is beyond open to DKI Jakarta Province. The participation from all stakeholder is needed to support the development of smart transportation and encounter the agile challenges at DKI Jakarta as a smart city.

Furthermore, share services and cloud computing solutions could helped modern higher education and universities to create low costs and efficient service management by collaboration and open environment. The creation off interconnected modern higher education ecosystem has become an important way for players in the field of education. This paper is to propose SOA adoption solutions for universities and education institutions by modelling and designing the interconnected modern higher education’s system. The aim is to create a new educational environment where learners have digital course and information accessible easily to support their educational and career goals. On the other hand, the solution is to understand the way universities and education institution solved demands complexity of the digital learning system by reducing investment costs.

On the other hand, IT world levitates demand of talented employees. In current situation, modern higher education is considered inadequate to deal with the demands. Modern Education in Indonesia is encountering a complex situation for higher education. The complex ecosystem intended to deliver learning material and develop potential talent to become expertise. We proposed the SOA system architecture which create a new ecosystem based on SOA. It will give student and other stakeholders have interconnected learning systems. We proposed SOA system architecture and SOA system reference for interconnected modern higher education in Indonesia. Its purpose is being interconnection between students, lecturers/instructors, universities, financial institutions, fund institutions, and employers/industries. In the end, we should be able to create powerful tools that have seamlessly connected platform which offers a valuable service. This innovation will create a rich opportunity for enterprise and wider community which enhanced the new digital learning experience and delivers a strong talent management & recruits, knowledge engagement, skills & employability, and needs of affordable education. © 2018 The Authors.

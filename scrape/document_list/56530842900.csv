The most commonly pavement failures found are potholes and stripping, which are related to water intrusion to the hot mix asphalt (HMA). This research aims to provide an analysis on the moisture susceptibility of HMA with the addition of waterproofing additives, namely the Wetfix-BE, Wetbond-SP, and hydrated lime. The Marshall, Cantabro Loss, and Indirect Tensile Ratio tests were undertaken to assess the performance of the prepared samples.

One of the additives that can be added is Xypex C-1000 NF, which a crystalline material. A number of past studies have shown that this additive is effective in improving the moisture resistance of concrete structure. However, the application of this additive in Indonesia was found to be challenging as the performance of the concrete mixture was not as good as expected. This research aims to evaluate the effect of adding various percentages of this additive, various amount of water to be added to the concrete mixture, and the methods of mixing the materials, which are wet and dry methods, by looking at both the slump value and the compressive strength of the concrete specimens. From the research results, it was found that the methods used to mix the additive matter to produce a desirable concrete quality. The wet mix method is the preferable method as it produces less variations in compressive strength test results regardless of the additional water amount.

Road pavement is an expensive infrastructure, and hence, it is important to ensure that the pavement layers can last until its designed lifetime. Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) pavement is one of the most commonly used type of pavement. However, the HMA pavements are often found with water-related distresses at an early stage, and hence, the pavement will not be able to last, while Indonesia is a tropical country and has a relatively high groundwater level in some major cities. Therefore, it is necessary to study an additive that could help in improving the moisture susceptibility of HMA layers. This study aims to provide an evaluation of moisture susceptibility of HMA pavements with the addition of waterproofing additives, including Wetfix-BE, and Wetbond-SP. Three tests were conducted to assess the moisture susceptibility, which are Marshall, Cantabro Loss, and Indirect Tensile Strength tests. It was found that both additives worked well in helping the HMA samples to be more resistant to water, although the samples with the additional of Wetbond-SP had a better performance than the samples with Wetfix-BE added. © 2019 Author(s).",,,,,,"Binus University: 12/AKM/PNT/2019

It is a common problem in major cities of Indonesia, especially in Jakarta, to have a road pavement being damaged after the rainy or monsoon season, especially when the pavements were flooded. This research aims to study the effect of moisture on asphaltic surfaces as designed according to Indonesian standards in order to determine the characteristic of the asphaltic mixture. The results of this study could help in identifying the issue(s) that cause the susceptibility of the asphaltic mixture, and hence, in the future, these issues could be handled better.The samples were prepared by using two different natural aggregates and two 60/70 asphalt binders that were sourced from different producers. There were four sample combinations prepared, which were then tested for Marshall, Cantabro Loss, and Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS) tests. The Marshall test was used to determine the stability and the flow of aggregates, while the other tests were used to determine the impact of water or moisture on the prepared samples. It was found that the samples that were prepared using Aggregate 2 had a higher stability and were more resistant to abrasion load after the samples being immersed in the water for one hour (based on the Cantabro Loss test results) than the samples that were prepared using Aggregate 1. However, from the ITS test results, it was found that the samples that were prepared using Aggregate 2 became “weaker” after being immersed in the water for 24 hours compared to the samples that were prepared using Aggregate 1. This could be due to the fact that Aggregate 2 had a higher percentage of water absorption value, which will place in effect after a long period of time. It did not seem to matter when the samples were being immersed for only one hour. It was also found that the Cantabro Loss and ITS test results had an inverse relationship, which could be due to the difference in the immersion time of both tests. © BEIESP.","Cantabro Loss; Hot mix asphalt; Indirect Tensile Strength; Moisture",,,,,,"The authors would like to thank Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education of Indonesia for its support for this research.","Samad, E., SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN FLEXIBLE PAVEMENT PERFORMANCE USING MECHANISTIC EMPIRICAL METHOD (CASE STUDY: CIREBON–LOSARI ROAD SEGMENT, WEST JAVA) (2012) J.

This research aims to analyse the performance of an admixture to make concrete mix to be waterproofed. In this research, a Xypex C-1000 was used. It was claimed to have the ability to improve the compressive strength of concrete structures and to reduce the permeability of concrete structures. From this research, it was found that there was a reduction in compressive strength for the concrete samples at 28 days compared to the compressive strength of the concrete aged 7 days. The reduction was significant for the concrete samples with Xypex C-1000. However, for the concrete samples aged 7 days with Xypex C-1000, it was found that there was a reduction in permeability of concrete structures, but only at certain dosage. For the concrete samples aged 28 days, the permeability of the samples were all below the allowable limit. In conclusion, based on these preliminary results, it can be seen that the Xypex C-1000 is effective in reducing the permeability of the concrete structures, but it is important further study the effect that the Xypex C-1000 has on the compressive strength of concrete structures. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

It is very important to ensure that the road networks perform well and last to their designed life. However, it is very common to find roads with asphaltic surfaces with some pavement failures not long after the construction finished. The most commonly pavement failures found are potholes and stripping, which are related to water intrusion to the hot mix asphalt. Indonesia is a tropical country and its soil has a high groundwater level in general. Therefore, it is very important to study the effect of moisture in asphaltic surfaces. This research aims to provide a preliminary analysis on the moisture susceptibility of hot mix asphalt. It was found that there were a few of Marshall test results that did not satisfy the requirements, which could be caused by human variation and the angularity of aggregates. The Cantabro Loss test results show that the HMA specimens lost around 11% and 15% of material after being exposed to water and abraded. From the research results, it was found that there is a strong relationship between the flow and the Cantabro Loss of the prepared HMA specimens. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

One of the alternative materials that have been widely used is the Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) aggregates. The RAP aggregates are derived from the crushed and screened pavement materials that contain asphalt and aggregates. This material is usually combined with natural aggregates and virgin asphalt binder to construct a new pavement. There have been numerous positive feedbacks in using this material although RAP aggregates also have certain weaknesses, such as questionable interaction between virgin and recycled materials and increased stiffness of RAP binder. Moreover, there has been a push on using rubber as an additive to asphalt binder to improve the welfare of rubber farmers. This research combines the usage of both latex and RAP as the ingredients to design hot mix asphalt (HMA) as latex could help in improving the flexibility of HMA and the interaction between the virgin and recycled materials. The main objective of this research is to find a suitable percentage of RAP aggregates to be used in HMA with certain percentage of latex as the binder additive. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","aggregates; hot mix asphalt; pavement; Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement","Aggregates; Asphalt pavements; Binders; Bins; Latexes; Pavements; Reclamation; Recycling; Rubber; Alternative materials; Hot mix asphalt; Natural aggregate; Pavement construction; Pavement material; Reclaimed asphalt pavements; Recycled materials; Rubberized asphalt; Asphalt",,,,,,"Chesner, W.H., Collins, R.J., MacKay, M.H., (1998), (Washington, DC, United States) User Guidelines for Waste and Byproduct Materials in Pavement Construction; Al-Qadi, I.L., Elseifi, M., Carpenter, S.H., (2007), (Urbana, IL) Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement - A Literature Review; Pradyumna, T.A., Mittal, A., Jain, P.K., Characterization of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) for Use in Bituminous Road Construction (2013) Procedia - Soc.

However, this test is a dry test and does not assess the performance of aggregates when they are wet. In tropical countries, including Indonesia, moisture on aggregates is an important issue as it might introduce problems to the pavement layers during and after the construction process. This research aims to investigate the capability of the LA Abrasion test to assess the moisture susceptibility of aggregates by altering the test procedure. In this research, the LA Abrasion test procedure was modified to test wet aggregates and the results were compared to the original LA Abrasion test. There are three different types of aggregates were tested herein, namely igneous, sedimentary, and coral aggregates. Additionally, the various percentage of clay was also added to cover the aggregates. From the preliminary results, it was found that the LA Abrasion test can be modified to detect the moisture susceptibility of aggregates. Different aggregates have different water absorption levels, and hence, affect the final result (percentage of material loss). Adding clay to the aggregates also affected the results. © 2017 Author(s).",,,,,,,,"Nataadmadja, A.D., Setyandito, O., Basrian, F.M., Kurniawardhani, M.G., The study of the usage of coral and limestone aggregates as asphaltic layer on coastal structures (2017) MATEC Web of Conferences; Smith, M.R., Collis, L., Aggregates: Sand, gravel and crushed rock aggregates for construction purposes (2001) The Geological Society; Hosking, J.R., (1970) Synthetic Aggregates of High Resistance to Polishing Part 1 - Gritty Aggregates; Hartley, A., (1974) J.

Any structures constructed along the coastline, such as pavement layer on sea dike, must be able to resist the hydrodynamic forces from the waves, such as the overtopping wave. It is necessary to find an aggregate to be used as surfacing layer for sea dike and/or flexible pavement that can withstand these (compressive) forces. This research analyses the feasibility of two natural aggregates, namely the coral and limestone aggregates, to be used as an ingredient for asphalt surface layer on coastal structures. Asphalt mix samples were prepared by using these two aggregates with various percentage of asphalt. The Marshall stability, flow, and the compressive force (Flab) of the prepared samples were tested in the laboratory. The stability and the flow of asphalt samples were tested to verify that the asphalt mix satisfies the requirements specified by Standar Nasional Indonesia 06-2489-1991. Moreover, this research also calculates the overtopping waves by varying the height and the period of the waves. The results were then converted as a compressive force (Fwave) and compared to the Flab to see whether the prepared samples could resist the calculated Fwave. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",,"Asphalt; Coastal engineering; Hydraulic structures; Levees; Limestone; Pavements; Underwater foundations; Asphalt surface layer; Coastal structures; Compressive forces; Flexible pavements; Hydrodynamic forces; Limestone aggregates; Marshall stability; Overtopping waves; Aggregates",,,,,,"Jassim, I., Tan, S., Vermeer, P.A., Hicks, M.A., (2012) Conference of the Association for Computational Mechanics in Engineering ACME; Pilarczyk, K.W., (1998) Dikes and Revetments: Design, Maintenance and Safety Assessment; Nandlal, S., (1985) Lightweight Semi-flexible Dike; Van Der Meer, J., Pilarczyk, K.W., (1998) Seawalls, Dikes and Revetments; (1977) Asphalt Revetments of Dyke Slopes, , Committee on The Compaction of Asphalt Revetments of Dyke Slopes; Devnita, R., (2009) Jurnal Geologi Indonesia, 4 (1), pp. 19-29; Yamin, A., (2011) Jurnal Jalan - Jembatan, 28, p. 3; Ogundipe, O.M., (2016) Transportation Research Procedia, 14, pp. 685-693; Manglorkar, D., Kandhal, P.S.K., Parker, F., (1991) Evaluation of Limestone Coarse Aggregate in Asphalt Concrete Wearing Courses 1991, , Auburn University Highway Research Center Alabama, United States of America; Chairuddin, F., Tjaronge, M.W., Ramli, M., Patanduk, J., (2016) IACSIT International Journal of Engineering and Technology, 8, p. 3; Bowers, N.A., (1944) Engineering News Record, pp. 80-85. , July; (1993) A Guide to the Structural Design of Bitumen-Surfaced Roads in Tropical and Sub-Tropical Countries, , Overseas Centre, Transportation and Road Research Laboratory; Palmer, J., (2013) Use of Coral As An Engineered Construction Aggregate in Pacific Runways; Schlüttrumpf, H., Van Der Meer, J., Kortenhaus, A., Bruce, T., Franco, L., Kim, Y.C., (2010) Handbook of Coastal and Ocean Engineering; Van Der Meer, J.W., Janssen, J.P.F.M., Kobayashi, N., Demirbilek, Z., (1995) Wave Forces on Inclined and Vertical Wall Structures; Franco, L., Gerloni, M.D., Van Der Meer, J.W., (1994) Coastal Engineering, pp. 1030-1045; Van Gent, M.R.A., (2002) 28th Conference on Coastal Engineering; Steendam, G.J., Van Der Meer, J.W., Hardeman, B., Van Hoven, A., (2012) International Conference on Coastal Engineering ICCE; Wati, W., (2015) Pengaruh Penambahan Bahan Alami Lateks (Getah Karet) Terhadap Karakteristik Campuran Hot Rolled Sheet Wearing Course (HRSWC); Bruce, T., Van Der Meer, J.W., Pullen, T., Allsop, W., (2009) Wave Overtopping at Vertical and Steep Structure; (2007) Calculation Tool, , http://www.overtopping-manual.com/aboutthis-site.html, HR Wallingford Ltd; Pullen, T., Allsop, N.W.H., Bruce, T., Kortenhaus, A., Schlüttrumpf, H., Van Der Meer, J.W., (2007) EurOtop Wave Overtopping of Sea Defences and Related Structures: Assessment Manual; (2010) Dokumen Pelelangan Nasional - Penyediaan Pekerjaan Konstruksi (Pemborongan) Untuk Kontrak Harga Satuan, , Direktorat Jenderal Bina Marga","Dwidarma Nataadmadja, A.; Civil Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: anataadmadja@binus.edu","Iskandar I.Agustina T.E.Komariah L.N.Ismadji S.Yani I.Hasyim S.","","EDP Sciences","1st Sriwijaya International Conference on Engineering, Science and Technology, SICEST 2016","9 November 2016 through 10 November 2016",,126687,2261236X,,,,"English","MATEC Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015903236

A number of laboratory tests have been developed to predict the long term in-field skid resistance of road surfaces, such as the Polished Stone Value (PSV) test, the Wehner/Schulze (WS) test and the Auckland Pavement Polishing Device (APPD) test (which is used in conjunction with the Dynamic Friction Tester (DFT)). Previous research conducted in France has shown that the WS test results reflect in-field skid resistance evolution. This finding has yet to be confirmed for New Zealand road surfaces. In New Zealand, routine skid resistance monitoring of state highways is undertaken annually using the Sideways Force Coefficient Routine Investigation Machine (SCRIM) device, which reports the skid resistance measured as the Sideways Force Coefficient (SFC). The historical annual surface condition data was extracted to obtain the in-field evolution relationships of a number of road sections in the Auckland and Waikato regions that were constructed using three geologically sourced natural aggregates; one Greywacke, one Basalt and one Andesite. SFC evolution curves were plotted against the accumulated heavy commercial vehicles (HCVs). A comparison was made between the in-field skid resistance and the predicted in-field skid resistance data derived either from WS or APPD laboratory tests. It was found that there is a good comparison between the two sets of data. Results are discussed in terms of using laboratory tests to predict in-field performance. © Copyright 2016 by Mairepav8 2016 Organizers.","APPD-DFT test; Laboratory test; Polishing; Skid resistance; Wehner/schulze device","Commercial vehicles; Design for testability; Forecasting; Laboratories; Pavements; Polishing; Roads and streets; Testing; Transportation; Heavy commercial vehicle; In-field performance; Laboratory test; Polished stone value tests; Polishing devices; Sideways force coefficients; Surface conditions; Wehner/schulze device; Skid resistance",,,,,,"Allen, B., Phillips, P., Woodward, D., Woodside, A., Prediction of UK surfacing skid resistance using wehner schulze and PSV (2008) International Safer Roads Conference, , Cheltenham; Arampamoorthy, H., Patrick, J., (2011) Potential of the Wehner-Schulze Test to Predict the Onroad Friction Performance of Aggregate, , Wellington: NZTA; Cenek, P., Davies, R., Henderson, R., Factors influencing the in-service skid resistance performance of aggregates (2008) 2nd International Conference on Surface Friction of Road Surfaces, , Cheltenham; Do, M.-T., Tang, Z., Kane, M., De Larrard, F., Pavement polishing-Development of a dedicated laboratory test and its correlation with road results (2007) Wear, 263, pp. 36-42; Do, M.T., Kane, M., Tang, Z., De Larrard, F., Physical model for the prediction of pavement polishing (2009) Wear, 267, pp. 81-85; Dunford, A., The Wehner Schulze machine and its potential use to improve aggregate specification (2008) International Safer Roads Conference, , Cheltenham; Erichsen, E., Relationship between PSV and in situ friction: A norwegian case study (2009) Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment, 68, pp. 339-343; Friel, S., Kane, M., Woodward, D., Use of Wehner Schulze to predict skid resistance of Irish surfacing materials (2013) Airfield and Highway Pavement 2013: Sustainable and Efficient Pavements, , Los Angeles: ASCE; Henry, J., Meyer, W., Prediction of aggregate and pavement polishing (1984) Of Engineering Geology and the Environment, 29, pp. 365-369. , Bulletin; Huschek, S., Experience with skid resistance prediction based on traffic simulation (2004) 5th Symposium on Pavement Surface Characteristics [Of Roads and Airports], , Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Kane, M., Do, M.T., Piau, J.M., On the study of polishing of road surface under traffic load (2010) Journal of Transportation Engineering, 136, pp. 45-51; Kumar, B., Wilson, D.J., Prediction of pavement surface skid resistance and the effect of smaller chip size (2010) IPENZ Transportation Group Conference, , Christchurch; Nataadmadja, A.D., Wilson, D.J., Costello, S.B., Do, M.T., Correlating laboratory test methodologies to measure skid resistance of pavement surfaces (2015) TRB 2015, , Washington D.C; Wilson, D.J., (2006) An Analysis of the Seasonal and Short-Term Variation of Road Pavement Skid Resistance, , Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering Unpublished Thesis, The University of Auckland; Wilson, D.J., Black, P.M., Comparison of skid resistance performance between greywacke and melter slag aggregates in New Zealand (2008) International Safer Roads Conference, , Cheltenham; Woodward, W., Woodside, A., Jellie, J.H., Higher PSV and other aggregate properties (2005) International Surface Friction Conference Christchurch, , New Zealand",,,"","Research Publishing Services","8th International Conference on Maintenance and Rehabilitation of Pavements, MAIREPAV 2016","27 July 2016 through 29 July 2016",,124664,,9789811104497,,,"English","Int.

In this study, a three-step methodology was developed to systematically measure and analyse aggregate profiles and compare the evolution of surface friction and roughness parameters. Criteria used for the three steps (selection of the areas to be measured, filtering of the profiles to keep only the relevant part for analysis, selection of roughness parameters) are presented and justified by considering on the one hand polishing and abrasion mechanisms and, on the other hand, the contact between a viscoelastic solid and a rough surface. The methodology is applied to three different New Zealand geologically sourced aggregates and polished by using the Wehner/Schulze device. Three-dimensional images of the samples were taken periodically during the test to record the microtexture changes due to polishing. Results show that roughness parameters expressing local shape, such as curvature of asperity tips, can reasonably explain the surface friction variation; height parameters such as the standardised profile root-mean-square are also explanatory but to a lesser extent. Relevance of the studied roughness parameters is discussed and interpretation in terms of physical change of surface texture is provided. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Curvature; Microtexture; Polishing; Surface friction","Aggregates; Filtration; Friction; Polishing; Skid resistance; Surface roughness; Tribology; Viscoelasticity; Abrasion mechanism; Curvature; Height parameters; Micro-texture; Roughness parameters; Surface friction; Three dimensional images; Viscoelastic solids; Agglomeration",,,,,,"Characterization of Pavement Texture by Use of Surface Profiles (2002), Part 2: Terminology and Basic Requirements Related to Pavement Texture Profile Analysis, British Standards Institution: London; Yandell, W.O., A new theory of hysteretic sliding friction (1971) Wear, 17 (4), pp. 229-244; Forster, S.W., (1981), Aggregate Microtexture: Profile Measurement and Related Frictional Levels; Zahouani, H., Vargiolu, R., Do, M.T., Characterization of microtexture related to wet road/tire friction (2000) Fourth International Symposium on Pavement Surface Characteristics, , Nantes, France; Do, M.T., Evolution of road-surface skid-resistance and texture due to polishing (2009) Wear, 266 (5-6), pp. 574-577; Dunford, A.M., Three-dimensional characterisation of surface texture for road stones undergoing simulated traffic wear (2012) Wear, pp. 188-196; Sabey, B.E., (1958) Pressure Distributions Beneath Spherical and Conical Shapes Pressed into a Rubber Plane, and their Bearing on Coefficients of Friction under Wet Conditions, 71, p. 979. , Proceedings of the Physical Society; Wilson, D.J., An Analysis of the Seasonal and Short-Term Variation of Road Pavement Skid Resistance, in Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (2006), p. 318. , The University of Auckland: Auckland; Kane, M., Development of an accelerated pavement test reproducing the effect of natural ageing on skid resistance (2012) Road Mater.

The standard laboratory test has historically been the polished stone value (PSV) test, as specified in British Standard EN 1097-8:2009. However, as the technology has advanced and traffic volume and composition on the roads have changed, other devices and methodologies have been developed in an attempt to provide better assessment of the skid resistance performance of surface aggregates. This study compared two alternative laboratory tests, the Auckland pavement polishing device (APPD) and the Wehner-Schulze (WS) devices, in assessing the skid resistance performance of three New Zealand greywacke aggregates. This paper discusses the variations in APPD and its corresponding skid resistance measuring device, the dynamic friction tester (DFT) and the effect of macrotexture in the APPD-DFT test. The results demonstrate a good relationship between the APPD-DFT and PSV tests and no relationship between the WS and PSV tests. However, the APPD and WS tests correlate well. The study used only three greywacke aggregates; therefore, no conclusive results can be drawn on the relationship between these laboratory tests as yet.",,"Agglomeration; Aggregates; Asphalt mixtures; Design for testability; Laboratories; Pavements; Polishing; Surface resistance; British Standards; Dynamic friction; Measuring device; Pavement surface; Polished stone value tests; Polishing devices; Skid resistance performance; Surface aggregate; Skid resistance",,,,"University of Auckland","The authors thank Patrick Maisonneuve and Jean-Fran?ois Le Fur of IFSTTAR, for conducting the WS tests.

The Polished Stone Value (PSV) test is the oldest and the most common test used worldwide to rank the skid resistance performance of road surfaces. Due to certain limitations of the PSV test, other laboratory test methodologies have been developed as potential alternatives. One of the limitations of the PSV test is that it only provides end of test results, whereas it is desirable to observe the skid resistance deterioration trend during the polishing process, in particular for research applications. This paper discusses the application of a mathematical model, originally developed for asphaltic concrete surfaces, to predict the skid resistance deterioration trend under polishing for a range of New Zealand chip seal aggregates. A laboratory skid resistance testing device, known as the Wehner/Schulze device, was used for this study since the model was originally derived based on test results obtained using this type of device. It was found that the model was capable of replicating the skid resistance deterioration trend under laboratory polishing of the chip seal aggregates used in this research. It was also found that the model coefficients were dependent on aggregate geological types, and thus suggested that a set of coefficients obtained for a specific aggregate source may be able to provide information on infield skid resistance performance of that specific aggregate type, if the model is found to be capable of replicating skid resistance deterioration trends in the field as well. As part of future research, the model will be calibrated against infield skid resistance.",,"Aggregates; Concrete aggregates; Deterioration; Polishing; Testing; Deterioration modeling; Laboratory test; Model coefficient; Polished stone value tests; Polishing processs; Research applications; Resistance testing; Skid resistance performance; Skid resistance",,,,,,"Arampamoorthy, H., Patrick, J., (2011) Potential of the Wehner-Schulze Test to Predict the On-road Friction Performance of Aggregate, , Research Report, New Zealand Transport Agency, Wellington; Black, P.M., (2009) Geologic Inventory of North Island Aggregate Resources: Influences on Engineering Materials Properties, , School of the Environment, The University of Auckland; British Standards, (2014) Test Methods for Hot Mix Asphalt.

These crashes can be directly related to inadequate skid resistance present on the road. It has been found that as the level of measured skid resistance reduces, the wet-pavement-related crash rate increases. There are a number of factors that affect the performance of pavement surfaces, but skid resistance is one of the more controllable factors. Therefore, most national state highway controlling authorities have developed skid resistance policies in order to maintain an adequate level of skid resistance in an attempt to reduce wet pavement loss of control crashes. There have been several studies dedicated to predicting the performance of surfacing aggregates prior to road and surfacing construction. Various laboratory test methodologies have been adopted to predict how the pavement surfacing will perform in the field. Of these, the PSV test is the most common laboratory test. However, due to the limitations of this test, several alternative methodologies and devices have been developed in an attempt to obtain a better prediction of the performance of pavement surfaces over their lifecycle. Furthermore, the majority of roads in New Zealand (NZ) are constructed using chip seal surfaces due to relatively low traffic volumes. This paper summarises several laboratory based test methodologies that have been trialled to predict the performance of chip seal surfaces in NZ and the correlation between the laboratory and in-field test results. The advantages and disadvantages of these methodologies are discussed in this paper.",,"Forecasting; Highway accidents; Laboratories; Pavements; Roads and streets; Testing; Transportation; Laboratory test; Loss of control; Number of factors; Pavement surface; Pavement surfacing; Skid resistance performance; Test methodology; Traffic volumes; Skid resistance",,,,,,"Allen, B., Phillips, P., Woodward, D., Woodside, A., Prediction of UK surfacing skid resistance using wehner schulze and PSV (2008) International Safer Roads Conference, , Cheltenham; Arampamoorthy, H., Patrick, J., (2011) Potential of the Wehner-Schulze Test to Predict the On-road Friction Performance of Aggregate, , Wellington: NZ Transport Agency; Black, P.M., (2009) Geologic Inventory of North Island Aggregate Resources: Influences on Engineering Materials Properties.: Geology, , School of the Environment, The University of Auckland; Cafiso, S., Taormina, S., Texture analysis of aggregates for wearing courses in asphalt pavements (2007) International Journal of Pavement Engineering, 8, pp. 45-54; Cairney, P., Macrotexture and crash risk - Some recent findings from Australia and their implications (2006) 22nd ARRB Conference - Research Into Practice, , Canberra, Australia: ARRB; Cao, Q., Nataadmadja, A., Wilson, D.J., Correlation between laboratory and field performance of South Auckland greywacke aggregates (2011) 3rd International Road Surface Friction Conference, , Gold Coast, Australia; Cenek, P., Davies, R., Henderson, R., Factors influencing the in-service skid resistance performance of aggregates (2008) 2nd International Conference on Surface Friction of Road Surfaces, , Cheltenham; Cenek, P., Henderson, R., Davies, R., (2012) Selection of Aggregates for Skid Resistance, , NZ Transport Agency research report Wellington: NZ Transport Agency; Cenek, P.D., Davies, R.B., Crash risk relationships for improved safety management of roads (2004) New Zealand Sustainable Land Transport Conference, , Wellington, New Zealand; Cenek, P.D., Jamieson, N.J., (2005) Sensitivity of an In-service Skid Resistance Performance of Chipseal Surfaces to Aggregate and Texture Characteristics International Surface Friction Conference Christchurch, , New Zealand; Dames, J., The influence of polishing resistance of sand on skid resistance of asphalt concrete (1990) Surface Characteristics of Roadway: International Research and Technologies, , MEYER, W.

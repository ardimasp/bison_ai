However, the socialization of these two matters is not regulated in existing laws and regulations, so that the information dissemination plan and dissemination of the information must be carried out to the community itself. In line with developments in technology and information systems that have entered the era of media convergence, the acceleration of the process of spreading government programs can also be done by using this technology. The SECI method model (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization) was developed through implementation based on the 'Knowledge Management System Cycle' theory, so that a knowledge management system was formed. The results of research on community preparedness in the application of Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) for natural disaster preparedness and mitigation can be used to support the dissemination and dissemination of disaster management mitigation, global warming, and community-based climate change, including performance measurement of success. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","climate change; disaster management; dissemination; knowledge management systems; SECI model","Climate change; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Global warming; Information dissemination; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Laws and legislation; Disaster management; dissemination; Government projects; Knowledge management system; Laws and regulations; Performance measurements; Regional government; SECI model; Climate models",,,,,,"U.

Pusdatin sees cloud computing as a technological innovation opportunity that promises lower costs, provides flexibility and optimization of resource, and ease of monitoring and management of servers and applications that can become a solution for the problems and concerns faced today. However, Pusdatin is faced with questions of how to properly adopt cloud technologies in their environment and gain all those benefits. This study uses Roadmap for Cloud Computing Adoption (ROCCA) model for the adoption strategy development. ROCCA adoption model consists of 5 phases namely the analysis, planning, adoption, migration, and management. Data were gathered from an interview, direct observation, and running several discovery tools within Pusdatin's IT environment. Data then processed through each phase of ROCCA model that produces the analysis, establishment of cloud program team, criteria, cloud architecture, migration steps, timeline, and priority that forms the detailed strategy for adopting cloud computing. The results of this study are recommended strategic steps to simplify and accelerate the implementation of cloud computing technology at Pusdatin. © 2018 IEEE.","Cloud Computing Adoption Strategy in Government Institution; Cloud Computing Adoption Strategy with ROCCA model","Agriculture; Information systems; Information use; Pattern recognition; Planning; Cloud architectures; Cloud computing technologies; Data and information; Direct observations; Government institutions; Monitoring and management; Strategy development; Technological innovation; Cloud computing",,,,,,"Pettey, C., Goasduff, L., (2018) Gartner Says Worldwide Public Cloud Services Market to Grow 18 Percent in 2017, , https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3616417, Gartner Newsroom (2017), [Electronic Version], March 9; Smith, D.M., (2017) Cloud Computing Primer for 2017, , https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?ct=170213&id=1-3TEKSKV&kui=D0EgBghKvGoqN1SYaqHXkA&st=sb, Gartner, [Electronic Version] 2018, March 9; Shimba, F., (2010) Cloud Computing: Strategies for Cloud Computing Adoption, , https://arrow.dit.ie/scschcomdis/29/, Dublin Institute of Technology, Retrieved March 25, 2018, from; Woods, J., Five options for migrating applications to the cloud: Rehost, refactor, revise, rebuild or replace (2011) Gartner the Future of IT Conference, , https://gartnerinfo.com/futureofit2011/MEX38L_A2%20mex38l_a2.pdf, October 4-6, Centro Banamex Mexico City, Mexico [2018, June 20]; Harrison, J., (2010) Essentials of Strategic Planning in Healthcare, , Health Administration Press, 1 edition; Harrison, J., (2012) Government Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Concerning the Implementation of Electronic Systems and Transactions, , PP Number 82 of 2012, Republic of Indonesia; Harrison, J., (2016) Regulation of the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Indonesia Concerning the Implementation of Information and Communication Technology at the Ministry of Agriculture, , Permentan Number 51 of 2016, Republic of Indonesia; Hafner, J., Schwingel, S., Ayers, T., Masuch, R., (2017) Azure Strategy and Implementation Guide, , https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/azure-strategy-and-implementation-guide/en-us/, Microsoft Corporation, [Electronic Version] 2018, June 20; Briggs, B., Kassner, E., (2017) Enterprise Cloud Strategy 2nd Edition, , Microsoft Press; Warnars, H.L.H.S., Lanita, Y., Prasetyo, A., Randriatoamanana, R., Smart integrated payment system for public transportation in Jakarta (2017) Bulletin of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, 6 (3), pp. 241-249. , September 2017; Agtriadi, H.B., Chandra, N., Warnars, H.L.H.S., Gaol, F.L., Software size measurement with use case point for employee application software at STT-PLN (2017) Cybernetics and Computational Intelligence (CyberneticsCom), 2017 IEEE International Conference On, , Phuket, Thailand, 20-22 Nov 2017; Tambotoh, J.J.C., Isa, S.M., Gaol, F.L., Soewito, B., Warnars, H.L.H.S., Software quality model for internet of things governance (2016) The 3rd International Conference on Data and Software Engineering (ICoDSE)2016, , 26-27th Oct 2016, Bali, Indonesia; Iskandar, K., Gaol, F.L., Soewito, B., Warnars, H.L.H.S., Kosala, R., Software size measurement of knowledge management portal with use case point (2016) The International Conference on Computer, Control, Informatics, and Its Applications (IC3INA 2016), pp. 42-47. , 3-5 Oct 2016, Tangerang, Indonesia; Warnars, H.L.H.S., Object oriented modeling with unified modelling language 2.0 for simple software application based on agile methodology (2011) Behaviour & Information Technology An International Journal, 30 (3), pp. 293-307; Christy, J., Hintarsyah, A.P., Warnars, H.L.H.S., Forecasting sebagai decision support systems aplikasi dan penerapannya untuk mendukung proses pengambilan keputusan (2018) Jurnal Sistem Komputer, 8 (1), pp. 19-27. , May 2018; Warnars, H.L.H.S., Rancangan infrastruktur e-bisnis business intelligence pada perguruan tinggi (2008) Journal Telkomnika, 6 (2), pp. 115-124. , August 2008; Warnars, H.L.H.S., Analisa dampak investasi teknologi informasi proyek data warehouse pada perguruan tinggi swasta dengan metode simple roi (2008) Journal Informatika, 9 (2), pp. 101-108. , November 2008","Harisno; Information System Management Department, Indonesia; email: harisno@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1st Indonesian Association for Pattern Recognition International Conference, INAPR 2018","7 September 2018 through 8 September 2018",,144686,,9781538694220,,,"English","Indones.

Climate change increase extreme and uncertain weather for horticulture cultivation. Farmers frequently face frequent damage to crops and decreasing in quantity and quality of plants. The development of a monitoring system that can help farmers grow crops is a crucial issue. In this paper, a study for a system for monitoring the performance of indoor micro-climate horticulture is presented. An electronic sensors Internet-of-Things (IoT) board is implemented to monitor the cultivation process. The sensor reading is collected into a database. The database is also integrated with the Indonesian Meteorological Agency data which consists of weather data and daily at the cultivation location. For our future work, the collected data are expected to be used for training machine learning models for the development of intelligence automated indoor micro-climate horticulture. © 2019 The Authors.

As with any other timetabling problems, it is an NP-complete problem, therefore no exact solution available for most of the problems. In this paper we proposed the deployment of three heuristics in an attempt to find feasible solutions with minimum number of soft constraint violations. First, a constructive heuristic is executed to find an initial feasible solution followed by a mechanism to find promising regions. The regions are then exploited using an intensive local search heuristic to find even better solutions. This method are tested on a popular examination timetabling problem (ExTP). The approach shows a reliable performance on the dataset and comparing to state of the art results, this approach contribute to improve the results in many instances. © 2018 IEEE.","business intelligent; computational intelligent; heuristic/metaheuristi; simulated annealing; soft computing; timetabling/scheduling","Computational complexity; Heuristic algorithms; Information management; Simulated annealing; Soft computing; Business intelligent; computational intelligent; Constructive heuristic; Examination timetabling; heuristic/metaheuristi; Local search heuristics; Reliable performance; Timetabling; Scheduling",,,,,,"Even, S., Itai, A., Shamir, A., On the complexity of timetabling and multicommodity flow problems (1976) Siam Journal on Computing, 5 (4), pp. 691-703; Qu, R., Burke, E.K., McCollum, B., Merlot, L.T.G., Lee, S.Y., A survey of search methodologies and automated approaches for examination timetabling (2009) Journal of Scheduling, 12 (1), pp. 55-89; Abounacer, R., Boukachour, J., Dkhissi, B., Alaoui, A.E.H., A hybrid Ant Colony Algorithm for the exam timetabling problem.

On the other hand, teacher's well-being might be disturbed by a negative impact from the program. This research aims to seek the subjective wellbeing of teachers in Jakarta and how to help teachers reach its wellbeing. The method use Neuroresearch (mix method), a mixture of qualitative research to build a theoretical construct and also observation as well as in-depth interviews with various parties and quantitative method by using measurement instruments subjective well-being Likert scale. The results found that (1) elementary teachers tend heading to wellbeing significantly at á <0.05 and (2) the cognitive dimension of teachers is an absolute determinant in shaping the well-being of primary school teachers. When a teachers cognitive is improved, then the wellbeing of primary school teachers will be increased by 20.983 from the current conditions. The study also found that the cognitive dimension is determined by the role of family situations and affective quality of teachers capable of acting 13.150 alters cognitive quality teachers.

To develop competitiveness, it takes an extra service to its customers. Before providing services, the provider of online games should know what players’ motivation to buy online games and virtual goods. This action is very useful to increase the provider’s competitiveness. The research was conducted with the case of online games where the respondents were located in Jakarta region and their age levels were between 15–24 years. There were 186 respondents of which 30 respondents were as to pilot test and 156 respondents for the actual test. Data processing used the Structure Equation Model (SEM) measurement variables which consist of effort expectancy, performance expectancy, perceived value, enjoyment story, enjoyment length, graphic enjoyment, enjoyment control, customization, purchase intention, and actual purchase behavior. The results show that the motivational factors influencing purchase intentions are perceived value, enjoyment story, length enjoyment, enjoyment control, and customization, while significant effect is indicated on purchase intention and actual purchase behavior. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

In this paper, we introduce a time invariant detection of paddy growth stages using single temporal resolution satellite data instead of high temporal resolution with complex cropping pattern. Our system is a kernelbased regularized learner that predicts paddy growth stages from six-bands spectral of Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. It evaluates three Kernel-based Regularized (KR) classification methods, i.e. Principal Component Regression (KR-PCR), Extreme Learning Machine (KR-ELM), and Support Vector Machine with radial basis function (RBFSVM). All data samples are divided into training (25%) and testing (75%) sampling, and all models are trained and tested through 10-rounds random bootstrap re-sampling method to obtain more variety on hypothesis models during learning. The best model for each classifier method is defined as the one which has the highest kappa coefficient during testing. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of each classifiers on testing are high competitive, i.e. 84.08%, 84.04%, and 84.95% respectively. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015","Kernel based learner; MODIS; Paddy growth stages; Phenology; Remote sensing","Biology; Database systems; Forestry; Principal component analysis; Radial basis function networks; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellites; Classification accuracy; Extreme learning machine; Growth stages; High temporal resolution; Kernel based learner; MODIS; Phenology; Principal component regression; Learning systems",,,,,,"Mulyono, S., Ivan Fanany, M., Basaruddin, T., Genetic algorithm based new sequence principal component regression (Ns-pcr) for feature selection and yield prediction using hyperspectral remote sensing data (2012) International Geosciences and Remote Sensing Symposium; Mulyono, S., Ivan Fanany, M., Basaruddin, T., A paddy growth stages classification using modis remote sensing images with balanced branches support vector machines (2012) International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems; Sun, H.-S., Huang, J.-F., Huete, A.R., Peng, D.-L., Zhang, F., (2009) Mapping Paddy Rice with Multi-Date Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Data in China Journal of Zhejiang University Science A, 10 (10), pp. 1509-1522; Lin, W., Fu-Cun, Z., Yuan-Shu, J., Xiao-Dong, J., Shen-Bin, Y., Xiao-Mei, H., Multi-temporal detection of rice phonological stages using canopy spectrum (2014) Sciencedirect, Rice Science, 21 (2), pp. 108-115; Xiao, X., Stephen Boles, T., Liu, J., Zhuang, D., Frolking, S., Li, C., Salas, W., Moore, B., III Mapping paddy rice agriculture in southern China using multi-temporal MODIS images (2005) Remote Sensing of Environment, 95, pp. 480-492; Xiao, X., Boles, S., Frolking, S., Li, C., Babu, J.Y., Salas, W., Berrien Moore III,: Mapping paddy rice agriculture in South and Southern Asia using multi-temporal MODIS images (2006) Remote Sensing of Environment, 100, pp. 96-113; Peng, D., Huete, A.R., Huang, J., Wang, F., Sun, H., Detection and estimation of mixed paddy rice cropping patterns with MODIS data (2011) International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 13, pp. 13-23; Jeong, S., Kang, S., Jang, K., Lee, H., Hong, S., Ko, D., Development of Variable Threshold Models for detection of irrigated paddy rice fields and irrigation timing in heterogeneous land cover (2012) Agricultural Water Management, 115, pp. 83-91; Sakamoto, T., Yokozawa, M., Toritani, H., Shibayama, M., Ishitsuka, N., Ohno, H., A crop phenology detection method using time-series MODIS data (2005) Remote Sensing of Environment, 96, pp. 366-374; Sari, D.K., Ismullah, I.H., Sulasdi, W.N., Harto, A.B., Detecting rice phenology in paddy fields with complex cropping pattern using time series MODIS data-A case study of northern part of West Java Indonesia (2010) ITB Journal Science, 42A (2), pp. 91-106; Vintrou, E., Bégué, A., Baron, C., Saad, A., Loseen, D., Traoré, S.B., A Comparative Study on Satellite and Model-Based Crop Phenology in West Africa (2014) Remote Sensing Journal, 6, pp. 1367-1389; Galford, G.L., Mustard, J.F., Melillo, J., Gendrin, A., Cerri, C.C., Cerri, C., Wavelet analysis of MODIS time series to detect expansion and intensification of row-crop agriculture in Brazil (2008) Remote Sensing of Environment, 112, pp. 576-587; Khobkhun, B., Prayote, A., Rakwatin, P., Dejdumrong, N., Rice phenology monitoring using PIA time series MODIS imagery (2013) 10th International Conference Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualization; Meng, J., Wu, B., Li, Q., Du, X., Jia, K., Monitoring crop phenology with MERIS data-A case study of winter wheat in North China plain (2009) Progress in Electromagnetics Research Symposium, , Beijing, China, March 23–27; Archibald, R., Fann, G., Feature Selection and Classification of Hyperspectral Images With Support Vector Machines (2007) IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letter, 4 (4). , October; Hsu, C.-W., Chang, C.-C., Lin, C.-J., A Practical Guide to Support Vector Classification (2010) Software, , http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin, last updated, April 15; Camps-Valls, G., Bruzzone, L., Kernel Based Method for Hyperspectral Image Classification (2005) IEEE Trans.

Weighted overlay method was used in land suitability analysis, whose weights of each plant was assumed to have the same growth factors including climate factors, topography, and physical lands. The reviewed agricultural commodities were avocado, chili, cacao, orange, litchi, coffee, pepper, mangos teen, and palm tree. The project results indicated a land suitability map which generated a range of data required by the agricultural businesses, such as variable name of villages, sub districts, districts, provinces levels ,and potential areas, presented through WebGIS which was built by using MapServer and MySql. WebGIS interface was made as easy as possible so users might adapt and get information easily. The recommended areas for each crop were reviewed based on climatic factors, topography, soil type, and land cover. Recommendation related to an appropriate area for the development of a commodity depends on a class of land suitability and available field areas. Information on the field suitability will be publicized through the WebGIS so the agribusinesses can determine what commodities, field area, and which region they have to develop.(H). © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Land suitability; Maps development; Webgis",,,,,,,"Alesheikh, A.A., Helali Dan, H., Behroz, H.A., Web gis: Technologies and its applications (2002) Dept. of Geodesy and Geomatics Engineering.

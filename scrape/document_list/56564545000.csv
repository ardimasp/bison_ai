The platform includes a social media web application along with, a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that supports the hosting and publication of various kinds of web applications with different technology stacks. The solution tries to address the problem of overreliance of companies in competitive programming contests as the barometer of whether a candidate is qualified for a job. The research is focused on the design and development of a complete system, which can be hosted on the PaaS. The proposed solution utilizes Ruby on Rails and React for the client application, along with the deployment of a cluster of CoreOS computers used to deploy user-generated application in a performant and scalable manner. The application interactions are reduced to API call, as an adherence to micro services-based architecture to improve horizontal scalability. The application has succeeded in fulfilling all the presented requirements, with a performance that is comparably better than conventional architectural designs. © 2018 The Authors.

The benefit of this research paper is; to show and explore the potential of using CQR code as a medium to encode audio files, which open the possibility to encode audio messages into a 2D barcode. By proving that it is possible to encode an audio data into a 2D barcode, it shows that there are unexplored potential uses for 2D barcodes other than just for typical Audio ID Date Capture (AIDC) uses or the more current trend mobile tagging, this research can also be a stepping stone for other future mass media applications wherein people can embed audio messages into 2D barcodes for mass media purposes. Utilizing 2D barcodes to encode audio data may also have the potential to counter audio piracy. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT & LLS.

This research aims to design and develop an application which lets users monitoring TransJakarta bus position with utilizing public data acquired from passengers’ phone GPS. It is not only from inside the bus stops, but everywhere as long as there is an internet connection. Users in buses will be able to supply additional road information, such as traffic jams, accidents and hazards to the public such that people waiting in the bus will not only know their next bus’ position but also the bus’ current status. The result of this research will be a prototype application which utilizes GPS, WebSockets, jQuery Mobile and Google Maps Services.

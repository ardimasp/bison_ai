Information about users and what they expressed through status updates are such important assets for research in the field of behavioral learning and human personality. Similar researches have been conducted in this field and it grows continually till now. This study attempts to build a system that can predict a person's personality based on Facebook user information. Personality model used in this research is Big Five Model Personality. While other previous researches used older machine learning algorithm in building their models, this research tries to implement some deep learning architectures to see the comparison by doing comprehensive analysis method through the accuracy result. The results succeeded to outperform the accuracy of previous similar research with the average accuracy of 74.17%. © 2017 The Authors.

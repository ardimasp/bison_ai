Indonesia's game development community is still budding and has more room to expand in continuing years. With Indonesia's rich culture it's a wonder how there are not many popular games that revolve around it, especially one that includes its unique cuisine. Subsequently, cooking games too have slowed down within the market where current games are not able to satisfy consumers therefore none are playing games from the genre. The authors decided to develop a game that utilizes both the cooking game genre and Indonesia's cuisine to appeal to the Android market. This is done through a survey for market research and player testing to accomplish a game worthy of the expectations of the current market. © 2019 IEEE.","Android Mobile Game; Cooking Game; Game Development; Game Mechanics; Mobile Application; Simulation","Android (operating system); Commerce; Software design; Android markets; Game design; Game development; Indonesia; Market researches; Video game; Human computer interaction",,,,,"Definition of GAME, , http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/game, Merriam-webster; McDonald, E., (2018) The Global Games Market 2017 | per Region & Segment Newzoo, , http://newzoo.com/insights/articles/the-global-games-market-willreach-108-9-billion-in-2017-with-mobile-taking-42/, Newzoo; (2017) China Topic Report: Mobile Games-Research and Markets Researchandmarkets, , http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/n95h5w/2017chinatopic, R. ltd, 2018; (2018) Newzoo, , http://newzoo.com/insights/infographics/the-indonesiangamer-2017/, The Indonesian Gamer 2017 Newzoo; (2018) Mobile Games-Indonesia Statista Market Forecast Statista, , http://www.statista.com/outlook/211/120/mobilegames/indonesia#market-revenue, [Accessed: 29-Mar-2018]; (2018) IGN: Cooking Mama Surpasses 500, 000, , http://web.archive.org/web/20090310001702/http://games.ign.com/articles/816/816299p1.html, Web.archive.org; (2018) Oxford Dictionaries English, , http://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cooking, Cooking: Definition of cooking in English by Oxford Dictionaries; Thomson, J., The very real psychological benefits of cooking for other people (2017) HuffPost UK, , http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/benefits-of-cooking-forothersus5967858ae4b0a0c6f1e67a15; Schell, J., (2015) The Art of Game Design, , Boca Raton CRC Press; Widjaja, J., (2018) Game Thesis Market Research Google Docs, , http://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pJcyVr9x5aLhPR13xmEpNnHS; Cook, Serve, Delicious!

That method may not be convenient for some people with knowledge or physical limitations. The raise for more pervasive, subtly blending computers in daily tasks may also find the method to be unnatural and inconvenient. Combination of modalities, or multimodal interaction is suggested to have advantages over unimodal input. Synergic multiple input and output modal is more expressive and natural. Specifically, studies have suggested that a combination of speech and gesture is preferred as being more effective and natural than speech or gesture alone. There are many successful approaches in providing robust gesture-only and speech-only interfaces, however, under extreme environments, unimodal approaches have user experience issues. To address the issue, the authors seek to explore and conduct a preliminary study and evaluation of speech-hand gesture recognition using Leap Motion and Windows Speech Recognition API. A conceptual framework would be developed as a result of this study. © 2019 IEEE","Gesture Recognition; Human Computer Interaction; Multimodal User Interface; Speech Recognition","Blending; Gesture recognition; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer systems; Palmprint recognition; Speech; User interfaces; Virtual reality; Conceptual frameworks; Extreme environment; Hand-gesture recognition; Human computer interfaces; Multi-Modal Interactions; Multi-modal interfaces; Multimodal user interface; Physical limitations; Speech recognition",,,,,"Lubar, S., Do not fold, spindle or mutilate: The cultural history of the punch card (1992) The Journal of American Culture, 15 (4), pp. 43-55. , December; Dotan, A., Input Devices, , http://www.slideshare.net/Amir_D/input-devices-1941161, Online; Freitas, D.Q., Gama, A.E.F., Figueiredo, L., Chaves, T.M., Oliveira, D.M., Teichrieb, V., Araujo, C., Development and evaluation of a kinect based motor rehabilitation game (2012) Simpósio Brasileiro de Jogos e Entretenimento Digital, 2012, Brasilia.

The degradation is not to be prevented as it happens as a side effect of technology. However, balancing usage of mobile device and quality of face-to-face communication is possible. By approaching users through developing a party genre mobile game with local multiplayer focus and introducing the given game to users, it is expected that face-to-face communication can be encouraged, thus resulting in mobile party game to become a media for the encouragement. A mini game that is a part of party game is developed with the help of Unity game engine as a testing object in which user response is collected. In the testing phase, target user response is collected, face-to-face encouragement is proven and user response is positive towards the game. Sample game testing has effectively re-introduced the existence of nowadays rare party game in mobile platform along with encouraging face-to-face communication, shown by the enthusiasm and enjoyment that audience testers have experienced. To conclude, mobile party games can help by being a media to encourage face-to-face communication and prevent degradation of such communication, future developments of a complete party game in mobile platform is highly encouraged as overall face-to-face communication quality enhancement may be required in the future in order to mitigate degradation. © 2016 IEEE.","Face-to-face Communication; Games; Local Network Unity; Mini Game; Mobile Device; Multiplayer; Party Genre; Racing","Mobile phones; Face-to-face communications; Games; Local networks; Mini Game; Multiplayers; Party Genre; Racing; Mobile devices",,,,,"(2014) Gartner Says Worldwide Traditional PC Tablet Ultramobile and Mobile Phone Shipments on Pace to Grow 7.6 Percent in 2014, , http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2645115, Retreived June 12, 2014, from; (2014), http://148apps.biz/app-store-metrics/?mpage=appcount, Retrieved April 24, 2014, from; Teens Prefer to Communicate Via Text -Study, , http://www.guidetoschools.ca/blog/Calgary-Schools-Teachers-Parents-Teens-Prefer-to-Communicate-Via-Texting-Study, n.d.).

One of the popular aspects of tourism for tourists is eco-tourism. Unfortunately, most eco-tourism destinations in Indonesia are in obscure or rural areas that are lacking in telecommunication signals as the area. Given the rapid uptake of smartphone technology and associated applications there is a need to evaluate the current and emerging state of the art and what this means for the tourism domain. Therefore, the nature of this study is to know what eco-tourists in Indonesia need from an offline application in the rural areas due to the lack of web access. This study uses quantitative and qualitative research methods. A questionnaire comprising 150 questions was distributed among eco-tourists in Jakarta. Content analysis was conducted among different websites and applications related to tourism in Indonesia. Providing a good experience with useful apps is helpful to motivate tourists to revisit the destination. This platform can be used by practitioners and researchers as a guideline to design usable mobile applications for eco-tourists and other niche segments of tourism. © 2017. ASERS Publishing.

It aims to create a sense of security on the user's application because it can monitor an area using mobile phone anywhere. The results obtained in this study is to create an area with a webcam monitoring application that can be accessed anywhere as long as the monitoring results have internet access and can also be accessed through Android Based Mobile Phone. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,"Logeswaran, R., Cost effective patient location monitoring system using webcams (2009) J.

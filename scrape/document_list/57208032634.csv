Based on the problems that often occur in companies in utilizing and implementing systems and information technology, this article tries to discuss how to evaluate the system and information technology and find out what factors are the cause, then by knowing the causal factors can be built mathematical models that can be used to build simulations so that it can be used as a solution in dealing with problems that occur in the future. The method used in this study is the method of factor analysis and regression methods. The results obtained from this study are knowledge development service factors, service development processes and service outcomes and objectives that must be considered by the company, then a simulation model can be made that can be used as an alternative in building predictions to anticipate future problem handling. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Competitive corporate; Factor analysis; Operational performance; Systems evaluation",,,,,,"Dahlgrün, P.W., Bausch, A., How Opportunistic Culture Affects Financial Performance in Outsourcing Relationships: A Meta-Analysis (2018) Journal of International Management, , press, corrected proof, Available online 1 September 2018; Ching, Y.-H., Hsu, Y.-C., Collaborative learning using Voice Thread in an online graduate course (2013) Knowledge Management & E-Learning, 5 (3), pp. 298-314; Farzaneh, N., Shamizanjani, M., Storytelling for project knowledge management across the project life cycle (2014) Knowledge Management & E-Learning, 6 (1), pp. 83-97; Goldoni, V., Oliveira, M., Knowledge Management Metrics in Software Development Companies in Brazil (2010) Journal of Knowledge Management, 14 (2), pp. 301-313; Laudon, K.C., Laodon, J.P., (2006) Management Information Systems Managing the Digital Firm, , 10th Edition (accessed on 20 th December 2012); Lee, K.C., Lee, S., Kang, I.W., KMPI: Measuring knowledge management performance (2005) Information and Management, 42 (3), pp. 469-482; Liang, D., Jia, J., Wu, X., Miao, J., Wang, A., Analysis of learners’ behaviors and learning outcomes in a massive open online course (2014) Knowledge Management & E-Learning, 6 (3), pp. 281-298; Martin, E.W., Brown, V.C., Dehayes, W.D., Hoffer, A.J., Perkins, C.W., (2012) Managing Information Technology: What Managers Need to Know, , 7th Edition, Prentice-Hall International, Inc.

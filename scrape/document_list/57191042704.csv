The most popular internet application in this country is social media. During the election in Jakarta, the phenomenon shows that many social media users do hatred in their posting. This situation gives a clue about the emotional factors related to Problematic Internet Use (PIU). According to PIU concept, people with PIU syndrome have maladaptive cognition and also maladaptive behavior. The hatred posting was part of maladaptive behavior. The objective of this study was to give empirical evidence the impact of three emotional factors, such as emotion reactivity, emotion regulation, and empathy, to PIU. Sample of this research were 274 undergraduate students from 2 universities in Jakarta. They were given 4 instruments self-report: GPIUS2, ERS, ERQ, and IRI. Results showed that the multiple regression of three emotional factors was significant to PIU. But only emotion reactivity gave the contribution in this study. It indicates that the emotion reactivity has role to PIU and it also explain about the hatred posting on social media. © 2017 IEEE.","Emotion reactivity; Emotion regulation; Empathy; Problematic Internet Use (PIU); Social media","Students; Emotion regulations; Empathy; Internet application; Maladaptive behavior; Multiple regressions; Problematic Internet use; Social media; Undergraduate students; Social networking (online)",,,,,"This research and publication was conducted with research grant from Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of Republic of Indonesia.

For that, researcher in this country needed validated instruments in local language. This paper presents the correlation between PIU and the two typology types of loneliness with the instruments in Indonesian version. Sample of this study was 316 undergraduate students related to social networking sites. The activity was the biggest activity on the Internet in Indonesia. PIU was measured by GPIUS2 (Generalized Problematic Internet Use Scale 2). The two typology types of loneliness were measured by SELSA (Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults). This research indicated that PIU has a significant correlation with only emotional loneliness, while social loneliness didn’t correlate to PIU. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

Computer technology used in teaching and learning can help improve children's preferences and abilities to learn mathematics in class, and can change attitudes of early childhood who are more critical, creative, and innovative. Jarimagic method is one method for learning to count on the fingers, where early childhood often communicate with fingers in learning mathematics in the classroom. For this reason, research attempts learning methods with interactive games with hand movements using the Jarimajic method and tools scratch 2.0. In this study, evaluation of data obtained through 20 child respondents was carried out by testing before using the game and after using the game, using Pre-Test and Post-Test analysis, which was divided into 2 results based on the preferences and abilities of early childhood learning mathematics in the classroom. From the study, the game development was carried out using the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) method by taking the model of implementation the waterfall model. then a game is designed to overcome this problem. After the game is made, the game will be tested again for early childhood, with T-Test statistical analysis as the final data obtained from research that shows whether early childhood likes and increases ability to learn mathematics after the game is implemented. The results of this study are the realization of interactive game-based learning methods for early childhood in learning to count mathematics. especially in learning additions and collection using the jarimajic method so that children have the ability and preference in learning mathematics. © 2019 IEEE.","finger-math; game interaction; jarimajic; user interaction","Information management; Life cycle; Software design; finger-math; game interaction; jarimajic; Learning Mathematics; Mathematics learning; System development life cycles; Teaching and learning; User interaction; Learning systems",,,,,"Richard, G.T., Kafai, Y.B., Responsive make and play: Youth making physically and digitally interactive and wearable game controllers (2015) In More Playful User Interfaces, , Springer; Lin, C.Y., Chang, Y.M., Interactive augmented reality using scratch 2. 0 to improve physical activities for children with developmental disabilities (2015) Research in Developmental Disabilities, 37, pp. 1-8; Chan, A.T., Leong, H.V., Kong, S.H., Real-time tracking of hand gestures for interactive game design (2009) 2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics, pp. 98-103. , July; Lee, H.S., Jeong, H.W., Kim, Y.K., Design and implementation of game for learning game production principles: Centering on scratch language (2016) Journal of Digital Convergence, 14 (5), pp. 403-410; Aulia, M.F., Berhitung dashyat dengan metode jarimagic (2009) Penambahan Dan Pengurangan, Yogyakarta: Pustaka Widyatama; Topalli, D.C.N.E., Improving programming skills in engineering education through problem-based game projects with Scratch (2018) Computers & Education, 120, pp. 64-74; Pellas, N., Vosinakis, S., Learning to think and practice computationally via a 3D simulation game (2017) In Interactive Mobile Communication, Technologies and Learning, , Springer November; Resnick, M., Maloney, J., Monroy-Hernandez, A., Rusk, N., Eastmond, E., Brennan, K., Kafai, Y.B., Scratch programming for all (2009) Communications of the ACM, 52 (11), pp. 60-67; Cira, N.J., Chung, A.M., Denisin, A.K., Rensi, S., Sanchez, G.N., Quake, S.R., Riedel-Kruse, I.H., A biotic game design project for integrated life science and engineering education (2015) PLoS Biology, 13 (3), p. e1002110; Hadi, S., Metode penelitian kuantitatif dankualitatif (2010) Jakarta, Penerbit Alfabeta, pp. 1-20",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","4th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2019","19 August 2019 through 20 August 2019",,152147,,9781728133331,,,"English","Proc.

The screening test for antimicrobial was perform against bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Shigella dysentris, and Vibrio cholera. The MIC and MBC were tested at concentrations of 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.8% and 1.6%. Based on the observations the antimicrobial screening that provide inhibition are ethanol extract and ethyl acetate fraction. The MICs against bacteria Bacillus subtilis (BS), Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and Salmonella typhi (ST) are shown at concentrations of 0.4%, 0.8% and 1.6%. The MBCs, by using the same bacteria, show the concentrations of 0.8% and 1.6% in the bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella thypi, while the Staphylococcus aureusbacteria give MBCs at all concentrations test. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

The purpose of this research was to determine the antioxidant activity and the effective concentration of Permot extracts (Passiflorafoetida.L). Method of Research is eksperimental study. 18 rats divided into 6 groups. Normal Group, Control group which were administrated by intraperitonial with CCl4 dose 1,0 ml/kgwb and Na-CMC. Group treatment by Vitamin C, Group Treatment by Permot extracts dose 100 mg/kgwb, 200 mg/kgwb and 400 mg/kgwb. The treatment of the all groups was conducted for 7 days. MDA (Malondialdehyde) was measured by spectrophotometer UV-Vis with a wavelength of 532 nm and SGPT measured by human analyzer. The analysis data between the all groups using One Way Anova, and continue by using Duncan comparison test after vitamin C and permot extract administration among the treatment groups was MDA level and SGPT.

This research is using qualitative research with ethnography approach which tries to understand the cultural aspect through a series of observation and interpretation human behavior. In more specific, an ethnography research focuses on what a group of people (cultural behavior) was performed, what they know (cultural knowledge), and what things that they make and wear (cultural artifacts).It is found that the diarrhea cause understood by BugisPonjo ethnic community is a result of supernatural factor as well as by nature and body disharmonisation. Through the understanding, it is identified the types of diarrhea which well known by the public namely sai, wolang, lenynyeisimulajajinna, urekeng, jambanglempu, and dyspepsia. Diagnostic, treatment, prognostic, and diarrhea prevention in children under five are an empiric norm and have become a pattern in the BugisPonjo ethnic community. The sign and symptoms of diarrhea become a basis to determine diarrhea types. Treatment will be conducted using traditional medicine plants like guava leave (Psidiumguajava), turmeric concoction (Curcuma domestica), candlenut concoction (Aleuritismoluccana), pepper (Piper betle), pepper concoction (Piper betle), bangle concoction (Zingiberofficinalepurpureum).","Children under five; Diarrhea; Etnomedisin; Traditional medicine","article; behavior; bugis ethnic community; child; cultural factor; diarrhea; diarrhea type; ethnic group; ethnographic research; general condition; human; Indonesia; public health problem; traditional medicine",,,,,"Jones, A.C.C., dan Farthing, M.J.G., An International Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2004) Management of Infectious Diarrhea, 53, p. 296. , Gut; Depkes, (2011) ProfilKesehatanNasionalTahun, , 2007, Jakarta; Sulsel, D., (2011) ProfilKesehatanProvinsi Sulawesi Selatan Tahun 2009, , Makassar; Dyson, L., MetodaEtnografi (2003) JurnalMasyarakat, KebudayaandanPolitik, 1, pp. 29-38. , Th XVI, No, Januari, 2003; Spradley, J.P., Participant Observation (1980) Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc, , Orlando, Florida; (1984) Analyzing Social Settings:A Guide to Qualitative Observationand Analysis, , Lofland and Lofland, Wadsworth Publishing Company.

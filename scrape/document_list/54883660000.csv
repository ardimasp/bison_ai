Research methods used are data collection method using questionnaire, data processing method using statistical tools such as pearson product moment correlation coefficient and cronbach's alpha, and data analysis method using gap analysis and Cartesians diagram. The expected result is user's expectation is greater than user's real experience; therefore, system quality and information quality have to be improved. Result shows that user is dissatisfied with applied monitoring information system right now. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Information; Monitoring; Quality; System","Cartesians; Data analysis methods; Data collection method; Data processing methods; Gap analysis; Information; Information quality; Monitoring information system; Product-moment correlation; research methods; Statistical tools; System; System quality; Two-dimension; User expectations; User's satisfaction; Cybernetics; Data handling; Image quality; Information analysis; Information systems; Statistical mechanics; Monitoring",,,,,"Gover, V., Straub, D., Dan Galluch, P., Turning the corner: The influence of positive thinking on the information systems field (2009) Manag Inf Syst Q, 33 (1), pp. 3-8; Al-Zeer, N.M., Dan Areiqat, A.Y., The role of information systems in scientific research (2010) Interdiscip J Contemp Res Bus, 2 (3), pp. 329-330; Hemmatfar, M., Salehi, M., Dan Bayat, M., Competitive advantages and strategic information systems (2010) Int J Bus Manag, 50 (7), pp. 158-159; Lee, C.Y., Total manufacturing information system: A conceptual model of a strategic tool for competitive advantage (2003) Integr Manuf Syst, 14 (2), pp. 114-122; Menon, N.M., Ulku, Y., Dan Cezar, A., Differential effects of the two types of information system: A hospital-based study (2009) Manag Inf Syst J, 26 (1), pp. 297-316; Rao, B., Dan Angelov, B., Pervasive systems value chain - A services perspective (2009) Int J Innov Technol Manag, 6 (1), pp. 17-40; Johnston, H.R., Dan Vitale, M.A., Creating competitive advantage with interorganizational information systems (2008) Manag Inf Syst Q, 12 (2), pp. 153-165; Fadel, J.K., Dan Brown, S.A., Information systems appraisal and coping: The role of user perceptions (2010) Commun Assoc Inf Syst, 26 (6), pp. 527-529; Hidayat, A., (2007) Six Sigma Strategies, , Elex Media Komputindo, Ltd., Jakarta; O'Brien, J.A., (2005) Introduction to Information System, , 12th ed.

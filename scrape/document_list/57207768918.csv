The conservation of non-renewable resources has crucial part for sustainable future. Therefore it is vital for designers and practitioners of architecture to apply material conservation in order to support environmental sustainability. This study aims to see the awareness of architects in conserving building materials and whether designing tools like sustainable building framework is applicable in the field. The case study was Mesvara House located in Yogyakarta. Data were collected through direct observation and interviews, and analysed using the sustainable building framework. Result of the study revealed that Vignette has awareness of sustainability by implementing all methods of material conservation strategy such as design for waste minimization, specify durable materials, specify natural and local materials, design for pollution prevention and specify non-toxic or less-toxic materials. The result also shown that sustainable building framework as designing tool are applicable in the field and can help designers and practitioners in the building industry to realize sustainability. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Architecture; material conservation; sustainability; sustainable building framework","Architecture; Conservation; Construction industry; Historic preservation; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Toxic materials; Building industry; Conservation of non-renewable resources; Conservation strategies; Direct observations; Environmental sustainability; Pollution prevention; Sustainable building; Waste minimization; Sustainable development",,,,,"Akadiri, P.O., Chinyio, E.A., Olomolaiye, P.O., Design of A Sustainable Building: A Conceptual Framework for Implementing Sustainability in the Building Sector (2012) Buildings, 2 (2), pp. 126-152; Song, Y., Zhang, H., Research on Sustainability of Building Materials (2018) IOP Conf.

Sustainability has become one of the major issues in the building industry, as it can help reducing the environmental impact. Therefore, it is vital for architects to apply sustainable design principles. This study aims to see the sustainability awareness of architects by assessing an architectural firm's project based on the sustainable building framework. The case study was Mesvara House in Yogyakarta designed by Vignette. Data were collected through direct observation and interviews, and analysed using the sustainable building framework as the assessment tool. Result of the study revealed that Vignette has shown that they are aware of sustainability issues in architecture by implementing all objectives in the framework such as recourse conservation for environmental sustainability, cost efficiency for economic sustainability, and design for human adaptation for social sustainability. For resource conservation, the architect applied effective construction method, using local materials, applied innovative watering system and using a non-arable land. For cost efficiency, the strategies implemented was low budget project, maximizing passive energy, utilizing easy-to-maintenance materials, and future expansion preparation As for design for human adaptation, this house applied thermal comfort and anticipated from fire, natural hazard and crimes. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

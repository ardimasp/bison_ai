Besides, it is aimed at developing formula complimentary food, and it is used as local food to prevent children from stunting. The characteristics of dadih were analyzed by biochemical and daily intake converted into percentages. Dadih powder was analyzed with proximate and the total of lactic acid bacteria. The nutritional composition formula is analyzed by using Nutrisurvey Programme. Based on the result, it is recommended that the dadih powder should be given daily to the children at the age of 6-8 months. Furthermore, about 126 children were measured by using ""anthropometric evaluation""to find out whether the children belonged stunting. The electronic scale was used to know the bodyweight of the children, and the recumbent length was taken by using length board. Each piece of equipment has a precise standard in which 0,1 kg is matching to 0,1 cm. The calorie in 100 g of dadih consists of 95.51 kcal with 31.8 g protein, 34.11 g fat, and 29.6 g carbohydrate. The formula of complementary food was recommended ad daily intake for children under two years of age based on their need: energy of 200 to 250 kcal and 6 to 8 grams of protein. Dadih powder was obtained by freezing technology and the use of vacuum heating to stabilize the powder. The nutritional composition of the dadih powder was standardized according to nutrition recommended to children under two years. Based on the anthropometric measurement of the nutritional status of children, there were 15.9 % stunting, 10.3 % underweight, and 3.2 % wasting. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","food; supplement; yoghurt","Agriculture; Anthropometry; Electronic scales; Lactic acid; Planning; Proteins; Sustainable development; Anthropometric measurement; Bodyweight; Daily intake; Lactic acid bacteria; Local foods; Nutritional compositions; Vacuum heating; West sumatra; Nutrition",,,,,"We would like to thank the Directorate of Research and Community Engagement from the Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia for funding this research through the Post-Doctoral Research scheme.",,"Pato Pato, U, Ali, M, Parlindungan, AK, Taurocholate Deconjugation and Cholesterol Binding by Indigenous Dadih Lactic Acid Bacteria (2005) Hayati, 12, pp. 103-107; Surono, IS, (2015) Traditional Indonesian Dairy Food Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 24, pp. S26-S30. , suppl 1; Kennas, A, Amellal-Chibane, H, Kessal, F, Halladj, F, Effect of Promegranate Peel and Honey Fortification on Physicochemical (2018) Physical Microbiologycal and Antioxidant Properties of Yoghurt Powder Journal of the Saudi Society of Agricultural Sciences, , doi.org; Drouault, S, Corthier, G, Effect Des Bacteries Lactiques Ingerees Avec Des Laits Fermentes (2001) Sur La Sante Vet.

The aim of the present study was to test the effect of 4-week functional food ingredient feeding, alone or in combination, on the gut microbiota composition in diabetic rats. Methods: Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were treated for 4 weeks with (1) native taro starch, (2) modified taro-starch, (3) beet juice, (4) psicose, (5) the probiotic L. plantarum IS-10506, (6) native starch combined with beet juice, (7) native starch to which beet juice was adsorbed, (8) modified starch combined with beet juice or (9) modified starch to which beet juice was adsorbed, to modulate the composition of the gut microbiota. This composition was evaluated by sequencing the PCR amplified V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Results: The next-generation sequencing showed beneficial effects particularly of taro-starch feeding. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) related to health (e.g. correlating with low BMI, OTUs producing butyrate) were increased in relative abundance, while OTUs generally correlated with disease (e.g. Proteobacteria) were decreased by feeding taro-starch. Conclusion: The results of study show that a 4-week intervention with functional food ingredients, particularly taro-derived starch, leads to a more healthy gut microbiota in rats that were induced to be diabetic by induction with STZ. © 2020 The Author(s).","Diabetes model; Functional food; Gut microbiota; Obesity; Prebiotic; Taro-starch","food ingredient; probiotic agent; RNA 16S; starch; taro starch; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bacterium; beet juice; body mass; Christensenellaceae; Clostridium; controlled study; high throughput sequencing; Holdemania; intestine flora; Klebsiella; Lactobacillus plantarum; male; nonhuman; Oscillibacter; Peptostreptococcaceae; Phascolarctobacterium; plant juice; polymerase chain reaction; population abundance; Prevotellaceae; rat; Ruminococcaceae; Ruminococcus; Shigella; species composition; Sprague Dawley rat; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus",,"starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9",,,,,"Wild, S., Roglic, G., Green, A., Sicree, R., King, H., Global prevalence of diabetes: Estimates for the year 2000 and projections for 2030 (2004) Diabetes Care, 27 (5), pp. 1047-1053; (2015), https://news.un.org/en/story/2015/07/505352-un-projects-world-population-reach-85-billion-2030-driven-growth-developing, UN-News, Accessed 29 Mar 2020; Lynch, S.V., Pedersen, O., The human intestinal microbiome in health and disease (2016) N Engl J Med, 375 (24), pp. 2369-2379. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2sXhvVSnsQ%3D%3D; Shapiro, H., Suez, J., Elinav, E., Personalized microbiome-based approaches to metabolic syndrome management and prevention (2017) J Diabetes, 9 (3), pp. 226-236; Karlsson, F.H., Tremaroli, V., Nookaew, I., Bergstrom, G., Behre, C.J., Fagerberg, B., Gut metagenome in European women with normal, impaired and diabetic glucose control (2013) Nature, 498 (7452), pp. 99-103. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXotlGls7k%3D; Qin, J., Li, Y., Cai, Z., Li, S., Zhu, J., Zhang, F., A metagenome-wide association study of gut microbiota in type 2 diabetes (2012) Nature, 490 (7418), pp. 55-60. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38XhsVaqt7fJ; Onwueme, I.C., (1978) The Tropical Tuber Crops - Yams, Cassava, Sweet Potato and Cocoyams, , Wiley Chichester; Asha, D.A., Genetic diversity analysis in taro using molecular markers - An overview (2012) J Root Crops, 38 (1), pp. 15-25; Solossa, A.H., Sastrahidayat, I.R., Hakim, L., Home gardens of the local community surrounding Lake Ayamaru, West Papua province, and its consequences for tourism development and lake conservation (2017) J Biodiv Environ Sci, 3 (3), pp. 1-11; Iskandar, J., Iskandar, B.S., Various plants of traditional rituals: Ethnobotanical research among the Baduy community (2017) Biosaintifika J Biol Biol Educ, 9 (1), pp. 114-125; Kreike, C.M., Van Eck, H.J., Lebot, V., Genetic diversity of taro, Colocasia esculenta (L.)

Probiotic has been widely known in maintaining gut health. However, the molecular mechanism of Lactobacillus plantarum IS-2056 probiotic in repairing intestinal brush border is not well defined. Therefore, current study was conducted by investigating the Galectin-4 and Myosin-1a expressions in a rodent model. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were induced with/without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and treated with/without L. plantarum IS-2056 probiotic. On the seventh day, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were collected and analyzed with western blot and immunohistochemistry for Galectin-4 and Myosin-1a expressions. RESULTS: Rats administrated with L. plantarum IS-2056 probiotic showed significant increase of Galectin-4 and Myosin-1a expressions in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05). While in control group, Galectin-4 level tended to increase in more distal of intestinal segment and Myosin-1a level tended to decrease in more distal intestinal segment. CONCLUSION: L. plantarum IS-20506 probiotic may facilitate the repairment of damaged intestinal brush border as demonstrated by significant restoration of Galectin-4 and Myosin-1a expressions in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of LPS-induced rats. © 2020 Prodia Education and Research Institute.

Polyunsaturated fatty acid contributes to maintain the lipid profile. Enterococcus faecium IS-27526 is a novel indigenous probiotic of dadih origin. The aim of this study was to find out the effect of probiotic and catfish (Clarias gariepinus) based functional feed on lipid profile of aged female Cynomolgus monkey/CM (Macaca fascicularis) fed with atherogenic diet. Methods: Nine CMs were randomly devided into 3 groups, in single blind intervention study for 90 days, namely: A1= atherogenic diet as control positive, A2= probiotic, A3= probiotic + catfish oil after 45 days adaptation period. The average of CM's bodyweight was in a range of 3 to 4 kg. The main ingredients of atherogenic diet were catfish flour, egg, sugar, egg yolk flour, and condiments. Serum lipid profile was assessed monthly by Cholesterol Oxidase-Peroxidase Aminoantipyrine (CHOP-POD) methods for cholesterol, LDL and HDL, while Glycerol-3-Phosphate Oxidase Peroxidase-Antiperoxidase (GPO-PAP) method for Triglyceride. Results: Atherogenic diet did not significantly affect appetite and bodyweight of the animals (p=0,12). The atherogenic diet significantly increased cholesterol and LDL level of animals (p=0.03 and p = 0.04) after 90 days administration. The CMs fed with probiotic E. faecium IS-27526 and catfish oil showed significant higher serum cholesterol (p=0,03) and LDL levels (p=0,04) compared to atherogenic diet alone and atherogic diet with probiotic E. faecium IS-27526. Probiotic E. faecium IS-27526 at 108 cfu/day stabilized the cholesterol and LDL level after 90 days administration compared with other groups of intervention. The TG and HDL of each group showed within normal range during the whole intervention study. Conclusion: Atherogenic feed significantly increased cholesterol and LDL level of CMs. Probiotic E. faecium IS-27526 showed a potential beneficial effect in maintaining lipid profile and could prevent dyslipidemia. © 2020 UPM Press.

At the same time, sustained glucose release is also beneficial for people suffering from glycogen storage diseases. Taro (Xanthosoma sagittifolium) is a tuber indigenous to Indonesia, which has starch as the major storage carbohydrate. Objective: The aim of the current study was to determine the speed of digestion of native and modified taro starch, compared to free glucose and wheat starch. Design: This was investigated in a validated, dynamic computer-controlled in vitro model of the stomach and small intestine (TIM-1). Samples were taken from the dialysate, which reflected glucose absorbed in the blood stream. Results: Native taro starch showed a ~1.5-fold reduced digestibility compared to glucose and a ~ 1.35-fold compared to wheat starch. In addition, digestion of native taro starch was moved towards the ileum, and later in time compared to glucose and wheat. With modified taro starch, these effects were not observed. Conclusion: In conclusion, native taro starch showed a lower glycemic load than wheat starch and modified taro starch and could be used as a substitute for refined foods by diabetics and people suffering from other glucose metabolic diseases. © 2020 Ingrid S.

Ensuring the functionality of probiotics can be a challenge for manufacturers due to harsh environment conditions during processing, handling and storage. Enterococcus faecium IS-27526 is one of novel probiotic strain isolated from dadih, traditional fermented buffalo milk of West Sumatra. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of microencapsulation, moisture absorber, and storage temperature on the half-life of probiotic powder estimated by Accelerated Shelf Life Testing (ASLT). There were two treatment groups, namely free cell (FC), and microencapsulated cell (EC), with additional treatment in each group, with addition of moisture absorber (MA) and without moisture absorber, stored at various temperatures (5°C, 27°C and 37°C) for 21 days and viable counts was assessed every 7 days. Storage temperature significantly affects the half-life of probiotic powder (p<0.05). At 5°C, EC significantly showed longer half-life than EC-MA, 140.14 ± 5.701 and 113.45 ± 3.242 days, respectively, at 27°C, EC significantly shorter half-life than EC-MA, 38.64 ± 6.831 and 42.35 ± 0.973 days, respectively.

Probiotics are clinically proven to be effective in accelerating recovery after urinary tract infection (UTI) and in decreasing recurrent UTI in children with or without structural disorders of the urinary tract. This study aimed to investigate the role of the probiotic L. plantarum IS-10506 in activating and regenerating renal epithelial stem cells in pyelonephritic rats. Fifty-five 20-weeks-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised into control, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and treatment (LPS and probiotic) groups. Pyelonephritis was induced with Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 LPS administered via a urethral catheter on the first experimental day to the LPS and treatment groups. Microencapsulated L. plantarum IS-10506 was orally administered once daily for up to 14 days to the treatment group. On days 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14, five rats per group were sacrificed and their kidneys were immunohistochemically analysed for production of interleukin (IL)-10, lipocalin-2 and Ki-67 in the renal tubular cells. IL-10 production was upregulated starting from day 3 through day 14 in the treatment group (P<0.05) compared with that in the control and LPS groups. Moreover, treatment with the probiotic led to increased activation of renal tubular stem cell, as indicated by a higher lipocalin-2 production, and further proliferation of renal tubular stem cells was documented by a higher Ki-67 production. Taken together, these results indicate that the anti-inflammatory probiotic L. plantarum IS-10506 improves renal injury in pyelonephritic rats by activating endogenous renal tubular stem cells to proliferate into mature renal tubular epithelial cells.","dadih; L. plantarum IS-10506; probiotic; pyelonephritis; renal tubular stem cells","interleukin 10; Ki 67 antigen; lipopolysaccharide; neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin; probiotic agent; animal; disease model; drug effect; immunohistochemistry; kidney tubule; Lactobacillus plantarum; metabolism; pathology; pyelonephritis; rat; regeneration; Sprague Dawley rat; stem cell; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Immunohistochemistry; Interleukin-10; Ki-67 Antigen; Kidney Tubules; Lactobacillus plantarum; Lipocalin-2; Lipopolysaccharides; Probiotics; Pyelonephritis; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Regeneration; Stem Cells",,"Interleukin-10; Ki-67 Antigen; Lipocalin-2; Lipopolysaccharides",,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,18762891,,,"32066257","English","Benef Microbes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079910940

Fecal samples were collected at baseline and after 4 weeks, and the composition of microbial communities was measured using 16S rRNA sequencing, while SCFAs were measured using ion chromatography. Bodyweight declined upon DM induction with STZ. Feeding taro starch led to a lower reduction in bodyweight than feeding taro starch, but this was only significant for taro starch in weeks 2, 3, and 4 (p=0.02, p=0.01, and p<0.01, respectively). Both taro starch and taro flour induced changes in the gut microbiota composition compared to AIN, which were different for taro flour and taro starch. Bifidobacterium, Sutterella, and Prevotella were markers for taro flour feeding, while Anaerostipes was a marker for taro starch feeding. Induction of diabetes also led to changes in the microbiota composition. Random Forest correctly predicted for 16 of 18 samples whether rats were diabetic or not and correctly predicted 6 of 12 microbiota samples belonging to either taro flour- or taro starch-fed groups, indicating also some significant overlap in the substrate, as expected. Taro starch and taro flour both led to a significant increase in the fecal concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate. © 2020 Ingrid S.

Slow digestion is beneficial for diabetic individuals. To investigate the effects on blood-glucose it is important to be able to predict the amount of digestible starch. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the digestibility of different starches in a validated in-vitro model of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Digestion was performed in the TNO dynamic, computer-controlled in-vitromodel of the upper GI-tract (TIM-1). Release of glucose was measured over time. Products tested were taro-flour, native-, and modified taro-starch. The latter two were also tested with beet-juice adsorbed. These were compared to wheat-flour and a glucose-solution. Modified taro-starch showed a similar glucose-bioaccessibility as wheat-flour (81–83%), while the other products tested had a lower bioaccessibility (60–75%). Adsorption of beet-juice affected digestibility of the modified taro-starch, but not the native-starch. Taro-based products can be used to lower plasma glucose concentrations in diabetic individuals. © 2020 The Author(s).

Lactobacillus plantarum (LP) IS-10506 was found to improve AD symptoms due to its immunomodulatory effects. Objective: To assess the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis Index (SCORAD), the serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), interleukin (IL)-4, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), forkhead box P3 (Foxp3+), and IL-17 levels in adults with mild and moderate AD after LP IS-10506 supplementation. Methods: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial comparing the microencapsulated probiotic (2 × 1010 CFU/day) and placebo (skim milk-Avicel) was conducted at an outpatient clinic on 30 adults with mild and moderate AD. The patients were divided into 2 groups with 15 patients each: intervention and control. Result: The SCORAD score was significantly lower in the probiotic than the placebo group on the 8th week. The IL-4 and IL-17 levels were significantly lower in the probiotic than the placebo group. The IFN-γ and Foxp3+ levels were significantly higher in the probiotic than the placebo group. However, the IgE levels remained significantly unchanged. Conclusion: The administration of LP IS-10506 is effective for alleviating AD symptoms in adults owing to its immunomodulatory effects. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","adult; Atopic dermatitis; Lactobacillus plantarum; probiotic",,,,,,,,"Leung, D.Y.M., Eichenfield, L.F., Boguniewicz, M., Atopic dermatitis (Atopic eczema) (2012) Fitzpatrick’s dermatology in general medicine, pp. 165-182. , New York (NY): Mc Graw Hill,.

Modification of starch into starch nanoparticles will open to opportunities for further development. The aim of this research was to find out the influence of acid types and hydrolysis length on the characteristics of the resulted starch nanoparticle. There were group of treatments including source of starch: Arrowroot and taro beneng starch, and the acid types was HCland H2SO4, and the length of hydrolysis was 3 and 5 hours. The results showed that the yield of arrowroot nanoparticle starch was higher than taro, 21.64-34.44% and 33.83-51.22%, respectively. Hydrolysis with HCl and H2SO4 produced starch nanoparticles (NP) with different characteristics. Treatment with HCl provides higher yield than that of H2SO4, but particle size was larger. The average size of the taro and arrowroot starch nanoparticles produced by hydrolysis by H2SO4 was 379.2 nm and 464.4 nm, respectively, with high polydispersity index of 0.480 and 0.621. Meanwhile, the crystallinity of taro and arrowroot starch NP increased from 44.1 into 87.3% and 43.5% into 51.3%, respectively. Acid hydrolysis improved solubility of starch nanoparticles but decreased the swelling power and gelatinization temperature. Starch nanoparticles can be implemented as a reinforcing agent for packaging, and carrier material for phytochemicals or agro-chemicals. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agriculture; Chlorine compounds; Crystallinity; Gelation; Hydrolysis; Nanoparticles; Particle size; Acid hydrolysis; Arrowroot starch; Carrier material; Effect of acids; Gelatinization temperature; Polydispersity indices; Reinforcing agent; Starch nanoparticles; Starch",,,,,"This research was financially supported by IAARD through KP4S program in 2016",,"Pareta, R., Edirisinghe, M.J., A novel method for the preparation of starch films and coatings (2006) Carbohydr Polym, 63 (3), pp. 425-431; Tomasik, P., Schilling, C.H., Chemical modification of starch (2004) Advances in Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biochemistry, 59, pp. 175-403; Xu, Y., Ding, W., Liu, J., Kennedy, J.F., Gu, Q., Shao, S., Preparation and characterization of organic soluble acetylated starch nanocrystal (2010) Carbohydr Polym, 80 (4), pp. 1078-1084; Chen, H., Weiss, J., Shahidi, F., Nanotechnology in nutraceuticals and functional foods (2006) Food Technol, 60, pp. 30-36; Lindeboom, N., Chang, P.R., Tyler, R.T., Analytical, biochemical and physicochemical aspects of starch granule size, with emphasis on small granule starches: A review (2004) Starch, 56 (34), pp. 89-99; Raeker, M.O., Gaines, C.S., Finney, P.L., Donelson, T., Granule size distribution and chemical composition of starches from 12 soft wheat cultivars (1998) Cereal Chem., 75 (5), pp. 721-728; Le Corre, D., Bras, J., Defresne, A., Starch Nanoparticles: A Review.

Microbiota produced Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) as an energy to maintain gut ecosystem and physiology. Dysbiosis is correlated with SCFA imbalance which in turn resulted in physiological abnormalities in the intestine, such as functional constipation. Materials and Methods: Randomized Double-Blind Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted on women with functional constipation (n=37) in the community of Jakarta and profile of SCFA was assessed by using GC-MS from the stool after 21 days supplementation of fermented milk (placebo and probiotic). Results: Probiotic supplementation significantly influenced acetate titer (p=0,032) marginally significant for propionate and butyrate (p=0.063 and p=0.068, respectively) and the respondent with increasing SCFA’s metabolite are higher in probiotic group compared to the respondents in placebo group. Acetate is the highest SCFA titer found in faeces samples of women with functional constipation. Conclusion: Probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum IS 10506 supplementation influenced all the SCFA parameter (acetate, propionate and butyrate). © 2019, Tehran University of Medical Science.

Probiotic consumption is commonly used to alleviate symptoms of constipation but the mechanism and the result remain unclear. Hence, this study was conducted to assess the effect of probiotics on constipation symptoms using PAC-SYM © (Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms) questionnaire. This was a randomized double-blind controlled trial (RCT) study, consisting of 73 subjects of urban women with functional constipation. This study compared three weeks of probiotic (Lactobacillus plantarum IS 10506) administration with placebo and evaluated improvements in PAC-SYM© scores before and after intervention. The subjects were divided into two groups, probiotics group (n = 34) and placebo group (n = 39), then were compared for their mean difference of PAC-SYM© scores. Our study suggested improvements of symptoms after three weeks of probiotic administration, as shown by the total score of PAC-SYM© (mean difference 7.65, 95% CI 3.1-12.20; p=0.001) along with three domains of PAC-SYM©, abdominal symptoms (mean difference 3.0, 95% CI 1.3-4.7; p=0.001), rectal symptoms (mean difference 1.62, 95% CI 0.12-3.13; p=0.034) and stool symptoms (mean difference 3.02, 95% CI 0.58-5.45; p=0.016.

In gut, Enterobacteriaceae is present in very low densities below 108 cfu/g. Elevated number of enterobacteriaceae in gut can promote gastrointenstinal infection. Probiotics has been used for a long time in treating gastrointestinal related diseases. This reaserch aims to evaluate the effect of Enterococcus faecium IS-27526 supplementation as a novel probiotic from Indonesia on gut microbiota. Species of bacteria that were successfully identified using both morphology and physiology identification test on bacteria resulted in four major genera which are Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Serratia and Escherichia. Total bacterial and Enterobacteriaceae number were calculated between test and control group. Total bacteria population from Total Plate Count result was 222.67 x 106 cfu/ml in control group and 210.33 x 106 cfu/ml in probiotics induced group. TPC result for Enterobacteriaceae population from probiotics induced group was 11.33 x 106 cfu/ml and 12.00 x 106 cfu/ml for the control group. The use of Enterococcus faecium IS-17526 has significantly reduced the total bacterial count as well as enterobacteriaceae population in gut. © 2019, World Research Association.

Changes in abundance of beneficial intestinal bacteria can affect health of individuals. Conversely, drugs, disease, diet and other factors can alter the gut microbiome. However, there is limited information on the effect of exogenous factors on gut microbiota. In this study, we investigated whether a beneficial bacterium, the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum IS-10506, can stimulate the gut–brain axis using Wistar rats. Materials and Methods: The animals were divided into two groups: one received L. plantarum IS strain 10506 supple-mentation, while the control group received no treatment. Activation of the gut–brain axis was evaluated by immunohisto-chemical analysis of intestinal and brain serotonin (5-HT) and brain neurotrophin (NT), serotonin transporter (5-HTT), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Results: The results showed that BDNF (p< 0.000), NT (p< 0.000007), and 5-HTT (p< 0.000007) expression was upregu-lated in the brain along with intestinal 5-HT (p< 0.000) level in rats treated with L. plantarum strain IS-10506 relative to the control group. Conclusion: The probiotic L. plantarum IS-10506 stimulates the gut–brain axis and can potentially promote brain development and function. © 2019, Tehran University of Medical Science.

Lactobacillus plantarum IS-10506 has the ability to improve gut barrier function. This study investigated the effect of L. plantarum IS-10506 on a number of biomarkers of en-teropathy-related damage in HIV-infected paediatric patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ARV). Materials and Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 2-18 year-old children, diagnosed as HIV infected according to the WHO 2007 criteria who had received ARV for ≥ 6 months. Subjects were excluded if ARV therapy was discontinued or the patients took probiotics ≥ 2 weeks prior to the study or during the study period. Subjects were randomized into a probiotic group and placebo group. The probiotic group received L. plantarum IS-10506 2.86 × 1010 cfu/day for 6 days. Blood lipopolysaccharide (LPS) level, serum CD4+ T cell count, serum CD8+ T cell count, CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio, and faecal sIgA level were assessed as biomarkers. Results: Twenty-one subjects completed this study. The blood LPS level decreased significantly in the probiotic group (p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in absolute CD4+ T cell count, percent CD4+ cells, absolute CD8+ T cell count, CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio, or faecal sIgA. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion: The probiotic L. plantarum IS-10506 reduced the blood LPS level but showed no effect on the humoral mucosa and systemic immune response in HIV-infected children undergoing ARV therapy. © 2019, Tehran University of Medical Science.

Postprandial triglyceride (TG)has been reported to have advantages compared to fasting TG in terms of practicality and ability to predict cardiovascular events. This study aims to assess the determinant of postprandial TG in healthy young adults. Methods: This is a quasy-experimental study that involved 200 healthy young adults. This study compared fasting with postprandial TG and analyzed the relationship between postprandial TG with various demographic and metabolic parameters after ingestion of standardized high fat liquid meal. Result: There was an upward trend from fasting TG to 2 h postprandial TG and 4 h postprandial TG. There was strong correlation between fasting TG and 2 h postprandial TG with 4 h postprandial TG (r = 0.731; p < 0.0001 dan r = 0.669; p < 0.0001, respectively). Whereas body mass index (BMI)and age showed weak correlation with 4 h postprandial TG (r = 0.141; p < 0.0001 dan r = 0.0747; p < 0.0001), fasting TG was the strongest predictor of 4 h postprandial TG (r = 0.669, B = 1.722 (95% CI 1.552 to 1.892), p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Fasting TG was the strongest determinant of 4 h postprandial TG in healthy young adults. We also observed strong correlation between 4 h postprandial TG and fasting TG. Hence, 4 h postprandial TG might potentially replaced fasting TG when measurement of fasting TG is not feasible. © 2019 Diabetes India","Determinant; Fasting triglyceride; Postprandial triglyceride; Young adult","glucose; triacylglycerol; biological marker; lipid; triacylglycerol; adult; Article; body mass; demography; diabetes mellitus; fasting; female; glucose blood level; human; lipid diet; major clinical study; male; metabolic parameters; normal human; obesity; postprandial state; priority journal; quasi experimental study; triacylglycerol level; young adult; adolescent; blood; controlled clinical trial (topic); middle aged; procedures; prognosis; Adolescent; Adult; Biomarkers; Body Mass Index; Diet, High-Fat; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Lipids; Male; Middle Aged; Non-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Postprandial Period; Prognosis; Triglycerides; Young Adult",,"glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; lipid, 66455-18-3; Biomarkers; Lipids; Triglycerides",,,"The study was sponsored by Suntory Beverage and Food PTE LTD .

The mechanism of action behind the health benefits is largely unknown, but several probiotic strains have been isolated from dadih, which may contribute to its health properties. To identify the composition of its microbiota, two artisanal dadih samples (n = 8) were collected from four producers. The raw buffalo milk used for fermentation was either pasteurized (n = 4) or not (n = 4), and back-slopping was used as a starter-culture (n = 5) or not (n = 3). DNA was extracted from each sample in duplicate and the microbiota composition was determined by 16S-rRNA-gene amplicon-sequencing of the V3–V4 region. PCoA analysis showed clear separation of the samples by producer, but no separation due to pasteurization or use of back-slopping. Lactococcus (52–83%) predominated in all samples, followed by Klebsiella (5–26%), and Lactobacillaceae, Bifidobacterium (particularly high (c. 18%) in the non-pasteurized, back-slopped product from Palupuh), Streptococcus and Leuconostoc. Back-slopping practice correlated significantly with higher abundance of Lactobacillaceae, Pediococcus, species of the order Burkholderiales, and Serratia, but with lower abundance of several other Enterobacteriaceae (including Klebsiella), Streptococcaceae, Staphylococcus and Brachybacterium. Pasteurization was not significantly correlated with the presence of certain members of the final microbiota. Taken together, fermentation results differ significantly from producer to producer and back-slopping practice would be advisable. Significance and Impact of the Study: Using state-of-the-art methods we determined the microbiota composition of dadih, an artisanal, traditional fermented buffalo milk of West Sumatra with health benefits. We show that the artisanal practice leaves room for standardization and optimization with respect to the presence of potential pathogenic species in the final product. The Dadih Initiative in Indonesia aims to expand production of this health promoting product, and the findings help to determine important steps for potential food safety issues and good-manufacturing-practices to obtain a safe, nutritious and healthy traditional yoghurt-like functional food. © 2018 The Authors.

Intestinal microbiota plays a significant role in host defence mechanisms as shown by inflammatory responses towards potential pathogens. We investigated the probiotic function of Lactobacillus plantarum IS-10506 of ‘dadih’ origin in modulating immune response in young children. We aimed to assess its effect on their immune response by assessing transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) responses and faecal secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) titre in a randomised, double-blinded placebo-controlled trial in 12-24-month-old children (n=38). We used four treatment groups for a 90-day supplementation period: placebo (n=11), probiotic (n=9), zinc (n=8) and probiotic and zinc (n=10). Faecal sIgA, plasma TGF-β1 and TNF-α titre were evaluated using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay standard technique. Statistical analysis divided the results (pre/post treatment) into high (>1) and low (<1) ratios. The results showed that faecal sIgA titre increased in all treatment groups compared with the control (placebo) and significantly increased in the probiotic group (P=0.05). In addition, the TGF-β1 ratio in the zinc group was significantly higher (P=0.05) than that in the placebo group. We observed a significant positive correlation between TGF-β1/TNF-α and faecal sIgA (r=0.27, P=0.04). Post hoc test results revealed that zinc supplementation has a significant effect on body-weight gain. Taken together, probiotic L. plantarum IS-10506 supplementation stimulates TGF-β1, which in turn increases the production of sIgA, in line with the significant correlation between TGF-β1/TNF-α and faecal sIgA. © 2019 Wageningen Academic Publishers.","Probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum; sIgA; TGF-β1; TNF-α; Young children","placebo; probiotic agent; secretory immunoglobulin; transforming growth factor beta1; tumor necrosis factor; zinc; probiotic agent; secretory immunoglobulin; TGFB1 protein, human; TNF protein, human; transforming growth factor beta1; tumor necrosis factor; zinc; age; Article; body weight gain; cellular immunity; child; controlled study; diet supplementation; double blind procedure; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; feces analysis; human; human experiment; humoral immunity; immune response; Lactobacillus plantarum; Lactobacillus plantarum IS 10506; protein blood level; randomized controlled trial; blood; chemistry; dietary supplement; feces; gastrointestinal tract; immunology; infant; Lactobacillus plantarum; metabolism; physiology; preschool child; Child, Preschool; Dietary Supplements; Feces; Gastrointestinal Tract; Humans; Immunoglobulin A, Secretory; Infant; Lactobacillus plantarum; Probiotics; Transforming Growth Factor beta1; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Zinc",,"zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6; Immunoglobulin A, Secretory; TGFB1 protein, human; TNF protein, human; Transforming Growth Factor beta1; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Zinc",,,"The authors thanks to Directorate General of Higher Education, Ministry of Education and Culture for Competitive Research Grant for International Publication Batch III No:696/SP2H/PP/DP2M/X/2009 and The Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) in supporting English Editing Service.",,"Agustina, R., Bovee-Oudenhoven, I.M.J., Lukito, W., Fahmida, U., Rest, O., Zimmermann, M.B., Firmansyah, A., Kok, F., Probiotic lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and lactobacillus casei CRL 431 modestly increase growth, but not iron and zinc status, among indonesian children aged 1-6 years (2013) Journal of Nutrition, 143, pp. 1184-1193; Ahmed, A.M.S., Ahmed, T., Roy, S.K., Alam, N., Hossain, M.D.I., Determinants of under nutrition in children under 2 years of age from rural bangladesh (2012) Indian Pediatrics Journal, 49, pp. 821-824; Bosch, M., Méndez, M., Pérez, M., Farran, A., Fuentes, M.C., Cuñé, J., Lactobacillus plantarum CECT7315 and CECT7316 stimulate immunoglobulin production after influenza vaccination in elderly (2012) Nutrition Hospital Journal, 27, pp. 504-509; Collado, M.C., Surono, I., Meriluoto, J., Salminen, S., Indigenous dadih lactic acid bacteria:cell-surface properties and interaction with pathogens (2007) Journal of Food Science, 72, pp. 89-93; Fergeuson, A., Humphreys, K.A., Croft, N.M., Technical report: Results of immunological tests on faecal (1995) Clinical and Experimental Immunology, 99, pp. 70-75; (2002) Guidelines for the Evaluation of Probiotics in Food.

In this study, we investigated the effect of probiotics on absorption of amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist used in the treatment of angina and hypertension, in a rabbit model. Methods: Lactobacillus plantarum IS-10506 probiotic was administered for 14 days to male New Zealand rabbits. Blood samples were collected before and after probiotic supplementation. Amlodipine (10 mg) was then administered to all groups. Blood samples from a marginal vein were withdrawn at 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes to determine amlodipine concentrations in rabbit plasma. Results: Amlodipine concentrations in the L. plantarum IS-10506 group were 4.95 ± 1.22, 8.71 ± 0.69, and 12.48 ± 2.53 ng/ml, and those in the control group were 1.69 ± 0.31, 3.89 ± 1.23, and 7.17 ± 1.85 ng/ml at 30, 60, and 120 minutes, respectively after administration of amlodipine. Amlodipine concentrations in the L. plantarum IS-10506 group were significantly higher than those in the control group at 30, 60, and 120 minutes after amlodipine administration. Conclusion: Our results suggested that supplementation of L. plantarum IS-10506 significantly increases amlodipine plasma concentrations in rabbits. © The Author(s) 2018.","absorption; amlodipine; calcium channel blocker; dadih; gastrointestinal tract; hematology; Lactobacillus plantarum; Probiotic","amlodipine; is 10506; probiotic agent; unclassified drug; amlodipine; antihypertensive agent; probiotic agent; angina pectoris; animal experiment; animal model; Article; controlled study; drug absorption; drug blood level; drug distribution; drug effect; drug efficacy; high performance liquid chromatography; hypertension; Lactobacillus plantarum; male; New Zealand rabbit; nonhuman; rabbit model; supplementation; time to treatment; animal; chemistry; dietary supplement; intestine absorption; Lactobacillus plantarum; Leporidae; metabolism; Amlodipine; Animals; Antihypertensive Agents; Dietary Supplements; Intestinal Absorption; Lactobacillus plantarum; Male; Models, Animal; Probiotics; Rabbits",,"amlodipine, 88150-42-9, 103129-82-4, 736178-83-9; Amlodipine; Antihypertensive Agents","Sigma Aldrich, Singapore",,"This work was financially supported by The Indonesian Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education (Grant-in-aid for International Research Collaboration and Publication) for RA.",,"Sastry, S.V., Nyshadham, J.R., Fix, J.A., Recent technological advances in oral drug delivery - a review (2000) Pharm Sci Technolo Today, 3, pp. 138-145; Martinez, M.N., Amidon, G.L., A mechanistic approach to understanding the factors affecting drug absorption: a review of fundamentals (2002) J Clin Pharmacol, 42, pp. 620-643; Laube, B., Winkler, S., Ladstetter, B., Establishment of a novel in vitro system for studying the interaction of xenobiotic metabolism of liver and intestinal microflora (2000) Arch Toxicol, 74, pp. 379-387; Gareau, M.G., Sherman, P.M., Walker, W.A., Probiotics and the gut microbiota in intestinal health and disease (2010) Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol, 7, pp. 503-514; (2002), http://www.who.int/foodsafety/fs_management/en/probiotic_guidelines.pdf, Guidelines for the Evaluation of Probiotics Food., (, accessed September 22nd, 2017; Fooks, L.J., Gibson, G.R., Probiotics as modulators of the gut flora (2002) Br J Nutr, 88, pp. S39-S49; Gillor, O., Etzion, A., Riley, M.A., The dual role of bacteriocins as anti- and probiotics (2008) Appl Microbiol Biotechnol, 81, pp. 591-606; Vineeth, S., Saireddy, S., Keerthi, T., Efficacy of Bacillus clausii and Saccharomyces boulardii in treatment of acute rotaviral diarrhea in pediatric patients (2017) Indones J Clin Pharm, 6, pp. 91-98; de Oliveira, G.L.V., Leite, A.Z., Higuchi, B.S., Intestinal dysbiosis and probiotic applications in autoimmune diseases (2017) Immunology, 152, pp. 1-12; Surono, I.S., Martono, P.D., Kameo, S., Effect of probiotic L. plantarum IS-10506 and zinc supplementation on humoral immune response and zinc status of Indonesian pre-school children (2014) J Trace Elem Med Biol, 28, pp. 465-469; Al-Salami, H., Butt, G., Fawcett, J.P., Probiotic treatment reduces blood glucose levels and increases systemic absorption of gliclazide in diabetic rats (2008) Eur J Drug Metab Pharmacokinet, 33, pp. 101-106; Haria, M., Wagstaff, A.J., Amlodipine.

Treatment for diabetic patients with hypertension is usually given a combination of drugs such as amlodipine (AML) and glibenclamide (GLI). The aim of this study was to develop and validate the simple simultaneous analysis method for separation of AML and GLI using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detector without derivatization. The arrangement of isocratic and gradient methods, mobile phase compositions, and flow rates to develop and validate the simple simultaneous analysis method for separation of AML and GLI by nonderivatization HPLC fluorescence was done. Optimum condition was obtained using an RP 18 (125 mm × 4 mm, i.d., 5 μm) and guard column RP 18 (4 mm × 4 mm, i.d., 5 μm) with mobile phase composition containing acetonitrile and phosphate buffer pH 3.0 using a 20:80 gradient condition at flow rate 1.0 ml/min measured at 361 nm for λ excitation and 442 nm for λ emission for AML and 235 nm for λ excitation and 354 nm for λ emission for GLI.

The Minangkabau ethnicity is unique compared to other ethnicities in Indonesia regarding its dietary pattern, in that this ethnic diet is high in fat intake and low in fibre intake. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between FTO rs9939609 variants and eating habits and food preferences among adolescent girls of Minangkabau ethnicity. Methodology: This study was a case control study and 275 adolescent girls (130 obese and 145 normal) were included. Tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (tetra-ARMS-PCR) was employed to examine genetic variants of FTO rs9939609. Eating habits were determined using an eating habits questionnaire and body mass index (BMI) was computed using the BMI Z-score (WHO). Results: This study revealed a significant relationship between genetic variants of FTO rs9939609 (TT, TA and AA genotypes) and higher BMI (p = 0.01). Those with the A allele were found to consume more fried food and have a lower intake of fruit (p<0.05) than those with the TT genotype. In the obese group, subjects with the A allele did not have a preference for a fruit-vegetable diet (p<0.05). Based on cooking method, subjects with the A allele preferred to eat less meat curry than those with TA and TT genotypes (p = 0.01). Conclusion: The genetic variants of FTO rs9939609 are associated with obesity, eating behaviour and food preferences in adolescents of Minangkabau ethnicity. © 2018 Susmiati et al.","Adolescents; Eating behaviour; Food preferences; FTO rs9939609; Obesity","alpha ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase FTO; carbohydrate; protein; adolescent; allele; Article; body fat; body height; body mass; body weight; caloric intake; case control study; child; comparative study; diastolic blood pressure; dietary fiber; dietary intake; fat intake; feeding behavior; female; food frequency questionnaire; food intake; food preference; food processing; fruit; genetic association; genetic polymorphism; genetic variability; genotype; hip circumference; human; lipid diet; macronutrient; meat; obesity; polymerase chain reaction; questionnaire; risk factor; school child; single nucleotide polymorphism; systolic blood pressure; vegetable; waist circumference; waist hip ratio; Western diet",,"alkB protein; alkylated DNA repair protein alkB homolog 1; alkylated DNA repair protein alkB homolog 4; alkylated DNA repair protein alkB homolog 5; alpha ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase alkB homolog 3; alpha ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase FTO; protein, 67254-75-5","Omron, Japan","1344/UN.16.13

Methods and Results: Free or microencapsulated probiotics, Lactobacillus plantarum IS-10506 or Enterococcus faecium IS-27526, resuspended in milk were studied for survival in the complete TIM-1 system (stomach + small intestine) or in the gastric compartment of TIM-1 only. Hourly samples collected after the ileal-caecal valve or after the pylorus were plated on MRS agar (for Lactobacillus) or S&B agar (for Enterococcus). Survival of the free cells after transit through the complete TIM-1 system was on average for the E. faecium and L. plantarum 15·0 and 18·5% respectively. Survival of the microencapsulated E. faecium and L. plantarum was 15·7 and 84·5% respectively. The free cells were further assessed in only the gastric compartment of TIM-1. E. faecium and L. plantarum showed an average survival of 39 and 32%, respectively, after gastric passage. Conclusion: There is similar sensitivity to gastric acid as well as survival after complete upper GI tract transit of free cells, but microencapsulation only protected L. plantarum.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=64) were randomised into control (KN), LPS (KL), probiotic + LPS (KL-Pr), and sequential probiotic + LPS + probiotic (KPR-7L) groups. Microencapsulated L. plantarum IS-10506 (2.86×1010 cfu/day) was administered via a gastric tube once daily for up to 7 days, and LPS (250 μg/kg body weight) was administered via a gastric tube on the first day of the experiment to all but the KN group. On day 3, 4, 6, and 7, four rats per group were sacrificed, and Lgr5, Bmi1, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and β-catenin expression in the ileum was assessed by immunohistochemistry. LPS treatment reduced Lgr5 (P≤0.05) and Bmi1 (P=0.000) levels in intestinal epithelial cells, whereas probiotic treatment increased levels of Lgr5 (KPR-7L, P=0.008) and Bmi1 (KL-Pr, P=0.008; and KPR-7L, P=0.000). Lgr5 expression was upregulated in the KL-Pr group on day 3, 4, 6, and 7 (P=0.056). Additionally, ERK levels were elevated in Bmi1-And Lgr5-expressing cells in rats treated with probiotics (KL-Pr and KPR-7L), whereas β-catenin levels were increased in Lgr5-expressing cells from KPR-7L rats and in Bmi1-expressing cells from KL-Pr and KPR-7L rats on day 3 and 4. These results demonstrated that the probiotic L. plantarum IS-10506 activated intestinal stem cells to counter inflammation and might be useful for maintaining intestinal health, especially when used as a prophylactic agent. © 2018 Wageningen Academic Publishers.","Intestinal stem cell; Lipopolysaccharide; Mucosal damage; Probiotic; Regeneration","beta catenin; BMI1 protein; mitogen activated protein kinase; BMI1 protein; Bmi1 protein, rat; G protein coupled receptor; Lgr5 protein, rat; probiotic agent; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bacterial strain; cell activation; controlled study; enteritis; Escherichia coli; ileum; immunohistochemistry; intestinal stem cell; intestine epithelium cell; Lactobacillus plantarum; male; microencapsulation; nonhuman; protein expression; rat; rodent model; upregulation; animal; cytology; drug effect; genetics; intestine; intestine mucosa; Lactobacillus plantarum; metabolism; physiology; Sprague Dawley rat; stem cell; Animals; Intestinal Mucosa; Intestines; Lactobacillus plantarum; Male; Polycomb Repressive Complex 1; Probiotics; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled; Stem Cells",,"mitogen activated protein kinase, 142243-02-5; Bmi1 protein, rat; Lgr5 protein, rat; Polycomb Repressive Complex 1; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled",,,,,"Akuzawa, R., Surono, I., Fermented milks of Asia (2002) Encyclopedia of Dairy Sciences, pp. 1045-1048. , Roginski, H.

Dysbiosis is an imbalance condition of beneficiary microbacteria cause by newer microorganism. This research aimed to investigate the effect of L. plantarum IS-10506 as probiotics supplementation on total bacterial and Enterobacteriaceae count; and also to identify the dysbiosis causing bacteria. Total bacterial and Enterobacteriaceae number on both control and test group were determined by Total Plate Count method. Identification of dysbiosis related bacteria were determined by fermentation test, gram staining, and Microbact™ 12A kit. The TPC result of total bacterial population on control group was 222.67 x 106 cfu/ml, while the probiotics induced group was 210.33 x 106 cfu/ml. As for the TPC result for Enterobacteriaceae population from control group was 12.00 x 106 cfu/ml, Enterobacteriaceae population in the probiotics induced group was 11.66 x 106 cfu/ml.

The objective of this study was to elucidate the effects of A. muricata leaf extract in humans and human cell lines. Methods and Study Design: Thirty outpatients with colorectal cancer who had undergone primary tumor resection were enrolled in a randomized double-blind placebo- controlled pre-post-trial. They were divided into two groups: those who ingested A. muricata leaf extract (n=14) and those who ingested a placebo (n=14) daily for 8 weeks. Twenty-eight subjects completed the trial; they were equally distributed between the two groups. Serum from patients of both groups was compared for cytotoxicity against colorectal cancer cell lines. The nutritional status of patients was monitored throughout the study. Results: Ex vivo and clinical studies showed higher cytotoxicity in the supplemented group compared with the placebo group. Further research is required to investigate the long-term effect of A.muricata leaf extract, particularly on parameters directly related to cytotoxic activity toward colorectal cancer cells and nutrition status.","Annona muricata; Colorectal cancer; Cytotoxicity; Leaf extract; Nutrition status","plant extract; Annona; chemistry; Colorectal Neoplasms; controlled study; double blind procedure; human; nutritional status; plant leaf; randomized controlled trial; tumor cell line; Annona; Cell Line, Tumor; Colorectal Neoplasms; Double-Blind Method; Humans; Nutritional Status; Plant Extracts; Plant Leaves",,"Plant Extracts",,,,,"Yee, Y.K., Tan, V.P.Y., Chan, P., Hung, I.F.N., Pang, R., Wong, B.C.Y., Epidemiology of colorectal cancer in Asia (2009) J Gastroenterol Hepatol, 24, pp. 1810-1816; Pourhoseingholi, M.A., Increased burden of colorectal cancer in Asia (2012) World J Gastrointest Oncol, 4, pp. 68-70; Soeripto, I.I., Gastro-intestinal cancer in Indonesia (2003) Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, 4, pp. 289-296; Yu, D.-Q., Recent works on anti-tumor constituent from Annonaceae plants in China (1999) Pure and Applied Chemistry, 71, pp. 1119-1122; García-Aguirre, K.K., Zepeda-Vallejo, L.G., Ramón-Gallegos, E., Alvárez-González, I., Madrigal-Bujaidar, E., Genotoxic and cytotoxic effects produced by acetogenins obtained from Annona cherimolia Mill (2008) Biol Pharm Bull, 31, pp. 2346-2349; Moghadamtousi, S.Z., Rouhollahi, E., Karimian, H., Fadaeinasab, M., Firoozinia, M., Abdulla, M.A., Kadir, H.A., The chemopotential effect of Annona muricata leaves against azoxymethane-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci in rats and the apoptotic effect of Acetogenin Annomuricin E in HT-29 cells: a bioassay-guided approach (2015) PLoS One, 10; Orwa, C., Mutua, A., Kindt, R., Jamnadass, R., Simons, A., (2009) Agroforestree Database: a tree reference and selection guide version 4.0, , http://wwwworldagroforestryorg/af/treedb/, [cited 2011/02/15]; Foong, C.P., Hamid, R.A., Evaluation of anti-inflammatory activities of ethanolic extract of Annona muricata leaves (2012) Revista Brasileira de Farmacognosia, 22, pp. 1301-1307; Baskar, R., Rajeswari, V., Kumar, T.S., In vitro antioxidant studies in leaves of Annona species (2007) Indian J Exp Biol, 45, p. 480; Alley, M.C., Scudiero, D.A., Monks, A., Hursey, M.L., Czerwinski, M.J., Fine, D.L., Abbott, B.J., Boyd, M.R., Feasibility of drug screening with panels of human tumor cell lines using a microculture tetrazolium assay (1988) Cancer Res, 48, pp. 589-601; Vistica, D.T., Skehan, P., Scudiero, D., Monks, A., Pittman, A., Boyd, M.R., Tetrazolium-based assays for cellular viability: a critical examination of selected parameters affecting formazan production (1991) Cancer Res, 51, pp. 2515-2520; Kim, G.-S., Zeng, L., Alali, F., Rogers, L.L., Wu, F.-E., Sastrodihardjo, S., Mclaughlin, J.L., Muricoreacin and murihexocin C, mono-tetrahydrofuran acetogenins, from the leaves of annona muricata in honour of professor .

Several plant polyphenols, such as flavonoid quercetin and flavone (2-phenyl-4H- 1-benzopyran-4-one) may have chemoprevention property by reducing the incidence of many types of cancer, especially in colon epithelia. This study aims to determine cytotoxic activity of the extracts and their total flavonoid content of the leaves extract. Methods: Extract used in flavonoid level determinaion is standardized water extract (Zirzak Orac), ethanol-soluble fraction (ESFAM) and ethanol-insoluble fraction (EIFAM). The level of flavonoid content was determined by spectrophotometer UV-Vis with quercetin and rutin as standard. Antiproliferative effect was evaluated against colorectal cancer cell line (DLD-1 and COLO 205), and normal cell (HEK) using microculture assay based on the metabolic reduction of 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol- 2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). Results: Flavonoid concentrations of Zirzak Orac, ESFAM, EIFAM are 0.15%, 0.83% and 0.07%, respectively. EIFAM shows the lowest IC50 value against DLD 1. The value of IC50 on the normal cells HEK is expected to be as high as possible, EIFAM has the highest. Conclusion. EIFAM showed selective cytotoxic activities in vitro, while it contains the lowest concentration of flavonoid and annonacin. © 2009-2017, JGPT.","Annona muricata L.; Cytotoxicity; Flavonoid","Annona muricata extract; annonacin; flavonoid; fluorouracil; phytochemical; quercetin; rutoside; Annona muricata; antiproliferative activity; Article; COLO 205 cell line; controlled study; DLD-1 cell line; drug cytotoxicity; human; human cell; IC50; in vitro study; MTT assay; nonhuman; plant leaf; ultraviolet spectrophotometry",,"annonacin, 111035-65-5; fluorouracil, 51-21-8; quercetin, 117-39-5; rutoside, 153-18-4, 22519-99-9",,,,,"Taylor, L., (2002) Technical data report for graviola annona muricata. herbal secretes of the rainforest, pp. 1-43. , 2 ed.

Evidence shows that the nutritional value of food is influenced in part by the structure and operations of an individual's gut microbial community, and food in turn shapes the individual's microbiome. A conference was held to promote understanding of the intestinal microbiome and its implications for health and disease, particularly among Asian populations. Methods and Study Design: Papers describing 1) the intestinal ecosystem in Asian populations, 2) changes in intestinal microbiota through life and its effects, 3) the Asian gut microbiota in disease conditions, 4) indigenous probiotics to maintain a healthy gut microbiota, 5) probiotic regulation in an Asian country, and 6) the results of a panel discussion are included in this report. Conclusions: The gut microbial inhabitants of Asian people differ from those of Europe and North America. Geographic location, diet, and ethnic background influence intestinal microbial composition. Urbanization and economic development have brought changes in traditional Asian diets, which in turn affected the gut microbiome, contributing to a shift in the region's health burden from infectious diseases to non-communicable chronic diseases. Novel probiotic strains of Indonesian origin demonstrated significant enhancement of humoral immune response in human studies. Knowledge gaps and implications for research to further understand the Asian gut microbiome were discussed.","Asia; Gut health; Intestinal microbes; Novel probiotics; Nutrition",,,,,,"Funding for the conference was provided by International Life Sciences Institute Southeast Asia (ILSI SEA) Region.

It's in vitro and in vivo probiotic properties have been assessed. Probiotic function has been shown in vivo by the suppression of allergic reactions in BALB/c mice through the action of T-regulatory cells cytokines by balancing Th1 and Th2 immune response. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic recurrent inflammatory skin disease characterised by the imbalance of Th1 and Th2. The aim of the study was to assess the probiotic function of L. plantarum IS-10506 in children with mild and moderate AD. A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial comparing microencapsulated L. plantarum IS-10506 (1010 cfu/day) and placebo (skim milk-Avicel) twice daily for 12 weeks was conducted in an outpatient clinic on children with mild and moderate AD. The trial included 22 AD children divided into intervention and control groups of n=12 and n=10 patients, respectively. Scoring Atopic Dermatitis Index (SCORAD) and serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), interleukin (IL)-4, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), forkhead box P3 (Foxp3+)/IL-10, and IL-17 levels were assessed. Demographic and baseline characteristics were not significantly different between the two groups. SCORAD and levels of IL-4, IFN-γ, and IL-17 were significantly lower in the probiotic group than those in the placebo group, while the IgE levels were not significantly changed. The ratio of Foxp3+ to IL-10 was significantly higher in the probiotic group than that in placebo group. Supplementation with the probiotic L. plantarum IS-10506 offered a potential treatment for children with AD. Further long-term studies with a larger sample size are required to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of L. plantarum IS-10506 in AD. © 2017 Wageningen Academic Publishers.","Atopic dermatitis; Children; Lactobacillus plantarum IS-10506; Probiotic; SCORAD","gamma interferon; immunoglobulin E; interleukin 10; interleukin 17; interleukin 4; placebo; probiotic agent; transcription factor FOXP3; cytokine; immunologic factor; placebo; probiotic agent; adaptive immunity; Article; atopic dermatitis; bacterial strain; CD4+ T lymphocyte; child; clinical article; clinical feature; controlled study; demography; diet supplementation; disease severity; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; female; human; immunoglobulin blood level; Lactobacillus plantarum; male; microencapsulation; milk; outpatient department; protein blood level; randomized controlled trial; regulatory T lymphocyte; Scoring Atopic Dermatitis Index; skin disease assessment; T lymphocyte activation; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; therapy effect; treatment duration; animal; atopic dermatitis; blood; growth, development and aging; Indonesia; Lactobacillus plantarum; pathology; preschool child; severity of illness index; treatment outcome; Animals; Child; Child, Preschool; Cytokines; Dermatitis, Atopic; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Immunologic Factors; Indonesia; Lactobacillus plantarum; Male; Placebos; Probiotics; Severity of Illness Index; Treatment Outcome",,"gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Cytokines; Immunologic Factors; Placebos",,,,,"Boguniewicz, M., Update on atopic dermatitis: insights into pathogenesis and new treatment paradigms (2004) Allergy and Asthma Proceedings, 25, pp. 279-282; Endaryanto, A., Immunoregulatory of Th1, Treg and Th2 through TLR2 and TLR4 by LGG and L. plantarum IS-10506 in suppressing allergic reaction (2006), PhD-thesis.

Consequently, each area has cultural identities developed over centuries, such as 742 different languages and traditional foods. Preserving agricultural products by fermentation has been carried out since the early seventeenth century especially for tempe. Local and traditional wisdom show the know-how of spontaneous fermentation which is mostly involving mixed cultures including lactic acid bacteria, conducting biopreservation of perishable agricultural products. The diversity of traditional fermented foods in the center of production reflects the importance of agriculture products and culture in each area, involving microbes of Indonesian biodiversities: tempe, gembus, growol, and gatot in Java; oncom, tauco, sayur asin, and tape singkong in West Java; brem in central Java and Bali; tempoyak, terasi, and dadih in Sumatera; Mandai in Kalimantan; and tuak in North Sumatera and Nusa Tenggara. The indigenous food popular products are existing since early history have formed an integral part of the diet and that can be prepared in the household or in cottage industry using relatively simple techniques and equipment, contribute to not only preserving the food but also improving nutritional status, serve as condiment or appetizers, and to the economic development of nonformal sector. The biodiversity of microbes involved in the traditional fermentation of foods needs to be explored more for the beneficial health and economic effect of the microbes, metabolites, or enzymes involved. © Springer India 2016.",,,,,,,,,"Afifah, D.N., Sulchan, M., Syah, D., Yanti, Y., Suhartono, M.T., (2013) Proteolytic and Fibrinolytic Activities of Several Microorganisms Screened from Red Oncom and Gembus, Indonesian Fermented Soybean Cakes., , Abstract No. 1.1 presented at 4th annual international symposium on wellness, healthy lifestyle and nutrition.

Annona muricata tea leaves, that is traditionally used for maintaining health, and lately being used by cancer patients. The objectives of this study is to investigate its effects in human colorectal cancer cell in vitro and ex vivo. Methods: Thirty patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) were enrolled in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. They were equally divided into two groups: those treated with 300 mg A. muricata leaf extract and placebo daily for 8 weeks. Serum from supplemented CRC patients of both groups was compared for caspase 9 and caspase 8 enhancement activity. Antiproliferative effect of water extract of A. muricata leaves and its fractions were evaluated against colorectal cancer cell line (DLD-1 and COLO 205) compared with 5-fluorouracil and placebo, the dose range was 62.5- 2,000 μg/mL. Method used was 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol- 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test. The p value was set at 0.05. Results: Ethanol-soluble fraction of A. muricata leaves extract water extract (ESFAM) leaves extract had cytotoxicity effects on DLD-1 as well as COLO 205 cell line, as shown by the lower IC50 compared to 5-fluorouracil and placebo, 20.59 μg/mL and 654.9μg/mL, respectively. Serum of subjects supplemented with extract significantly induced caspase 9 (p=0.001) activity of DLD-1 colorectal cancer cell line, but not for caspase 8 activity (p=0.372). Conclusion: The study's results suggest the cytotoxicity potential of A. muricata leaves extract in in vitro and ex vivo studies. © 2016 Authors.","A. muricata leaves; Colorectal cancer cell line; Cytotoxicity; Ex vivo; In vitro",,,,,"G/ML.01.04/2012, 036/H2","The authors are grateful to the Centre for Ageing Studies, Universitas Indonesia for funding this study, contract No.036/H2.R12.5/?G/ML.01.04/2012.

It is a yogurt-like product with a distinctive thicker consistency, smooth texture, and pleasant avor and has provided safety, portability, and novelty to milk nutrients for the indigenous people in West Sumatra. Currently, dadih is consumed as a traditional food, served at weddings and while giving an honorable title “Datuk” in West Sumatra during the ethnic tradition or “adat” ceremony. Generally, dadih is consumed during breakfast with rice after adding sliced shallot and chili (“sambal”), or it is mixed with palm sugar and coconut milk, being served as a topping of steamed traditional glutinous rice akes, a corn ake-like product, called “ampiang dadih”. © 2016 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,"Akuzawa, R., Surono, I.S., Fermented milks of Asia (2002) Encyclopedia of Dairy Sciences, pp. 1045-1048. , H.

It is based on evidence that intestinal lactase activity persists into later childhood and throughout life in only a minority of the world's population, notably northern European-derived populations. These people have the T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the rs49882359 allele (C/T), also known as C/T-13910, the MCM6 gene which positively influences the lactase LCT gene. Other lactase persistent (LP) populations are found in Africa and the Middle East with different genetic variants. These SNPs represent co-evolution with dairying since the agricultural revolution and nutrient-dependent ecological adaptation. That said, gastrointestinal symptoms considered due to small intestinal lactose malabsorption are poorly correlated with lactase non-persistence (LNP), the situation for most people. With LNP, colonic microbiome lactase enables lactose fermentation to occur so that none is found in faeces. Whether the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and gases (hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane) produced cause symptoms is dose-dependent. Up to 25 g of lactose at any one time can usually be consumed by a LNP person, but its food and meal pattern context, the microbiomic characteristics, age and other factors may alter tolerance. Thus, the notion that lactose intolerance is a disorder or disease of LNP people is misplaced and has been one of cultural perspective. What actually matters is whether a particular dairy product as normally consumed give rise to symptoms. It is, therefore, proposed that lactose tolerance tests be replaced with dairy food tolerance tests.","Dairy food tolerance test (DFTT); Gut microbiome; Lactase non-persisters (LNP); Lactase persisters (LP); Rs49882359 allele","lactase; lactose; Africa; allele; dairy product; dairying; enzymology; Europe; fermentation; genetic variability; genetics; health status; human; intestine; intestine absorption; intestine flora; lactose intolerance; metabolism; Middle East; nutrition; pathophysiology; physiology; single nucleotide polymorphism; small intestine; Africa; Alleles; Dairy Products; Dairying; Europe; Fermentation; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Genetic Variation; Health Status; Humans; Intestinal Absorption; Intestine, Small; Intestines; Lactase; Lactose; Lactose Intolerance; Middle East; Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",,"lactase, 9031-11-2; lactose, 10039-26-6, 16984-38-6, 63-42-3, 64044-51-5; Lactase; Lactose",,,,,"Leonardi, M., Gerbault, P., Thomas, M., Burger, J., The evolution of lactase persistence in Europe.

A 90 days randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study ofpre-post trial was conducted in pre-school children with two groups, placebo and probiotic group. Ultra High Temperature low fat milk was used as a carrier in each group. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of E. faecium IS-27526 in milk on humoral immune response and on bodyweight of pre-school children. Total serum IgA and total salivary sIgA were measured by sandwich ELISA. The bodyweight of young children was measured. The results showed that total serum IgA did not significantly increase in the probiotic group compared with the placebo group.

For optimum function of the starter cultures, safety, purity, and stability of active starter cultures need to be maintained. In addition, optimum fermentation condition and milk as growth medium are also important factors in producing fermented milk. All fermented milk starter cultures produce acids. Lactic acid bacteria are the most important groups, primarily used because of their ability to ferment lactose, resulting in the production of lactic acid for homofermentative starter cultures, but some starter cultures, namely heterofermentative starter cultures, may also perform other metabolic activities, such as carbon dioxide production in kefir, exopolysaccharide formation contributing to thicker consistency of fermented milk, and production of flavor compounds such as diacetyl. Problems encountered in fermented milk industry, mostly due to the presence of bacteriophage and antimicrobial substances that may inhibit the activity of bacterial starter cultures, resulted in decreased viscosity and reduced flavor development. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,"Charteris, W.P., Kelly, P.M., Morelli, L., Collins, K.J., Ingredient selection criteria for probiotic microorganisms in functional dairy foods (1998) International Journal of Dairy Technology, 51 (4), pp. 123-136; (1996) Dairy Starter Cultures, , Wiley-VCH, New York, T.M.

Codex Standard for Fermented Milks (Codex Stan 243-2003) describes fermented milk, concentrated fermented milk, and flavored fermented milks. Amendment to the Codex Standard for Fermented Milks pertaining to Drinks based on Fermented Milk is being developed with a minimum content of 40% fermented milk. Each country has its own standards for milk as raw material, starter culture, manufacturing procedures, quality requirements, and legal requirements. Codex Standard for Fermented Milks (Codex Stan 243-2003) defines the viable count of yogurt starter. The current standards of identity for fermented milks concern milk fat, milk protein content, amount of starter cultures, a minimum live and active culture content of labeled microorganisms added as supplement to the specific starter cultures, and titratable acidity expressed as lactic acid. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Fermented milk; Lactic fermentation; Milk fat; Milk Protein; Mold in lactic fermentation; Standard of identity; Starter culture; Titratable acidity; Types of fermented milk; Yeast-lactic fermentation",,,,,,,,"CODEX STAN 243-2003; (1982), IDF Bulletin 149; (1997) Dairy starter cultures of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) standard of identity, , IDF Bulletin 149A; Kosikowski, F.V., Mistry, V.V., Cheese and Fermented Milk Foods (1997) Origins and Principles, 1. , FV Kosikowski, Westport, CT; Kosikowski, F.V., Mistry, V.V., Cheese and Fermented Milk Foods (1997) Procedures and Analysis, 2. , FV Kosikowski, Westport, CT; Kurmann, J.A., Rasic, J.L.J., Technology of fermented special products (1988) Bulletin of the IDF, No. 227, pp. 138-164. , IDF, Brussels, Fermented Milks Science and Technology; Kurmann, J.A., Rasic, J.L.J., Kroger, M., (1992) Encyclopedia of Fermented Fresh Milk Products, , Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York; Lee, Y.K., Wong, S.F., Stability of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milk (1993) Lactic Acid Bacteria, pp. 103-114. , Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, S.

The Old Testament mentions that fermented cream existed in Mesopotamia in c. 1300. BC, and laban rayed and laban khad were manufactured perhaps as early as 5000. BC. The skills of making fermented milk were introduced to Russia and other European areas by the Tartars, and to central Asia by the Huns and Mongols. The 'Silk Road' contributed to the early development and spread of fermented milks. Various methods have been used for the manufacture of traditional fermented milks. The bacteria essential for fermentation originate from fermentation vessels, raw milk, the alimentary tract of animals, and plants. Warm raw milk from the cows, sheep, goats, water buffaloes, camels, or horses of the nomads was turned into clabber or curd by indigenous bacteria, by means of traditional fermentation.

The aim was to evaluate the main factors influencing the viability and metabolic activity of the probiotic strains, as well as their capacity to remove microcystin-LR. Both L. plantarum strains isolated from dadih, as well as Bifidobacterium lactis strains Bb12 and 420, were shown to be more resistant, and &gt;85% remained viable in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution for 48 h of incubation at either temperature, while the viability of the other four commercial bacteria decreased markedly over time. The effect of glucose on viability and removal of toxin was shown to be a strain-specific and strain-dependent property, but in general, the efficiency of microcystin-LR removal increased when glucose was added to the solution. A maximum removal of 95% was observed for L. plantarum strain IS-20506 (37°C, 1011 colony-forming units mL-1) with 1-2% glucose supplementation and 75% in PBS alone. © 2008 American Chemical Society.","Glucose; Metabolism; Microcystin-LR; Probiotic; Viability","Bacteria (microorganisms); Bifidobacterium animalis; Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis; Cyanobacteria; Lactobacillus plantarum; bacterial toxin; glucose; microcystin; microcystin LR; probiotic agent; animal; article; Bifidobacterium; fermentation; Lactobacillus; Lactobacillus plantarum; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; metabolism; microbiology; milk; Animals; Bacterial Toxins; Bifidobacterium; Fermentation; Glucose; Lactobacillus; Lactobacillus plantarum; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; Microcystins; Milk; Probiotics",,"glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; microcystin LR, 101043-37-2; Bacterial Toxins; cyanoginosin LR, 101043-37-2; Glucose, 50-99-7; Microcystins",,,,,"Falconer, I.R., Humpage, A.R., Tumour promotion by cyanobacterial toxins (1996) Phycologia, 35, pp. 74-79; Ito, E., Kondo, F., Terao, K., Harada, K., Neoplastic nodular formation in mouse liver induced by repeated intraperitoneal injections of microcystin-LR (1997) Toxicon, 35, pp. 1453-1457; Sivonen, K., Jones, G., Cyanobacterial toxins (1999) Toxic Cyanobacteria in Water, , Chorus, I, Bartram, J, Eds, E & FN Spon: London, United Kingdom; (2004) Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality, 1. , WHO, 3rd ed, World Health Organization: Geneva, Recommendations; Jochimsen, E.M., Carmichael, W.W., An, J.S., Cardo, D.M., Cookson, S.T., Holmes, C.E.M., Antunes, M.B., Jarvis, W.R., Liver failure and death after exposure to microcystins at a hemodialysis center in Brazil (1998) N.

The objective was to study the main environmental factors influencing the metabolic activity of L. plantarum in MC-LR removal. Residual MC-LR was quantified using HPLC. Non-viable cells inactivated by boiling or acid showed only low MC-LR removal (<23 %). Viable L. plantarum strain IS-10506 at pH 7, at 22 and 37 °C was able to remove MC-LR, 64% and 43%, respectively, after 30 h. Strain IS-20506 at pH 7, at 22 and 37 °C removed 92% and 45 %, respectively, after 30 h. At 37 °C, the removal of MC-LR was lower than at 22 °C. Supplementation with glucose (1%, 2%, and 3%, w/v) resulted in faster and higher removal of MC-LR at 37 °C, while at 22 °C it did not improve MC-LR removal. In the presence of 1 % glucose, IS-10506 and IS-20506 demonstrated significantly the most efficient removal of 80% and 65% of applied MC-LR, after 25 and 20 h, respectively, at pH 7, 37 °C. Viable cells as well as active metabolism play important roles in removing MC-LR. This finding offers new and economical tools for decontaminating microcystin containing water. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Autoaggregation correlates with adhesion, which is a prerequisite for colonization and infection of the gastrointestinal tract by many pathogens, whereas coaggregation has been related to the ability to interact closely with pathogens. The results demonstrated significant differences in cell surface properties among the tested natural lactic acid bacteria food strains. Hydrophobicity increased when the cells were heat inactivated. All strains showed aggregation abilities with the pathogen strains tested, but the coaggregation properties were strain-specific. Our results indicate that the ability to autoaggregate, together with cell surface hydrophobicity and coaggregation abilities with pathogen strains, can be used for preliminary screening in order to identify potentially probiotic bacteria suitable for human or animal use. This study suggest the importance to identify and characterize bacterial cell-wall properties to understand their role in adhesion to hydrocarbons, autoaggregation and relation to coaggregation mechanisms, and also the relevance to future probiotic food development from natural strains. © 2007 Institute of Food Technologists.","Adhesion; Coaggregation; Dadih; Pathogens; Probiotics","hydrocarbon; probiotic agent; animal; article; bacterium adherence; food control; heat; human; hydrophobicity; intestine; Lactobacillus; metabolism; microbiology; pathogenicity; physiology; species difference; Animals; Bacterial Adhesion; Food Microbiology; Heat; Humans; Hydrocarbons; Hydrophobicity; Intestines; Lactobacillus; Probiotics; Species Specificity; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms)",,"Hydrocarbons",,,,,"Akuzawa, R., Surono, I.S., Fermented milks of Asia (2002) Encyclopaedia of dairy science, pp. 1045-1048. , London: Academic Press. p; Bibiloni, R., Perez, P.F., Garrote, G.L., Disalvo, E.A., De Antoni, G.L., Surface characterization and adhesive properties of bifidobacteria (2001) Methods Enzymol, 336, pp. 411-427; Boris, S., Suarez, J.E., Barbes, C., Characterization of the aggregation promoting factor from Lactobacillus gasseri, a vaginal isolate (1997) J Appl Microbiol, 83 (4), pp. 413-420; Canzi, E., Guglielmetti, S., Mora, D., Tamagnini, I., Parini, C., Conditions affecting cell surface properties of human intestinal bifidobacteria (2005) Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek, 88 (3-4), pp. 207-219; Cesena, C., Morelli, L., Alander, M., Siljander, T., Tuomola, E., Salminen, S., Mattila-Sandholm, T., Von Wright, A., Lactobacillus crispatus and its nonaggregating mutant in human colonization trials (2001) J Dairy Sci, 84, pp. 1001-1010; Collado, M.C., Gueimonde, M., Hernandez, M., Sanz, Y., Salminen, S., Adhesion of selected Bifidobacterium strains to human intestinal mucus and its role in enteropathogen exclusion (2005) J Food Prot, 68 (12), pp. 2672-2678; Collado, M.C., Gueimonde, M., Sanz, Y., Salminen, S., Adhesion properties and competitive pathogen exclusion ability of bifidobacteria with acquired acid resistance (2006) J Food Prot, 69 (7), pp. 1675-1679; Collado MC, Meriluoto J, Salminen S. 2007.

In previous studies, it was discovered that strains of dadih lactic isolates possessed some beneficial properties in vitro. In the present study, the adhesion capacity of specific LAB isolates from dadih to intestinal mucus was analyzed. Further, the ability to inhibit model human pathogens and displace them from mucus was assessed. The adhesion of tested LAB strains was strain-dependent and varied from 1.4 to 9.8%. The most adhesive Lactobacillus plantarum strain was IS-10506, with 9.8% adhesion. The competition assay between dadih LAB isolates and pathogens showed that a 2-h preincubation with L. plantarum at 37°C significantly reduced pathogen adhesion to mucus. All tested LAB strains displaced and inhibited pathogen adhesion, but the results were strain-specific and dependent on time and pathogen strains. In general, L. plantarum IS-10506 showed the best ability against pathogen adhesion.

It was discovered that ten strains of dadih lactic isolates possessed some probiotic properties in vitro. In this study, the adhesion properties of dadih LAB, in comparison with documented probiotic strains, were investigated in vitro by using mucin extracted from human faeces and Caco-2 cells as the models for human intestinal mucosal surface and intestinal cells respectively. The adhesion results showed the distinction of Lactobacillus reuteri IS-27560 in adhering to both mucus layer and Caco-2 cells. The competition assay for adhesion to the mucus layer between dadih LAB and selected pathogens indicated the competence of Lactococcus lactis IS-16183 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus IS-7257 in significantly inhibiting the adhesion of Escherichia coli O157:H7. Accordingly, these two strains may be potential candidates for use as probiotic strains. Overall, the adhesion properties of all dadih LAB strains were relatively comparable to that of Lactobacillus casei shirota and lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, the documented probiotic strains.","Adhesion; Caco-2 Cells; Dadih; Lactic Acid Bacteria; Mucin; Probiotics","Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Lactobacillus casei; Lactobacillus reuteri; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; Lactococcus lactis",,,,,,,"Beachcy, E.H., Bacterial adherence: Adhesion-receptor interactions mediating the attachment of bacteria to mucosal surfaces (1981) J.

Anaerobic lactic acid bacteria decreased and coliforms increased in the feces of the control group; however, the number of fecal lactic acid bacteria remained unchanged when rats were administered milk and fermented milks. Only fermented milk made from Lc. lactis subsp. lactis IS-10285 significantly reduced serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and total bile acids. Milk and fermented milks did not influence the HDL cholesterol. Triglyceride and phospholipid levels were significantly lower in the rats fed fermented milk of Lc. lactis subsp. lactis IS-10285 than rats fed milk and fermented milk of Lc. lactis subsp. lactis IS-29862, but not significantly different from the control group. Hypocholesterolemic effect of Lc. lactis subsp. lactis IS-10285 was attributed to its ability to suppress the reabsorption of bile acids into the enterohepatic circulation and to enhance the excretion of bile acids in feces of hypercholesterolemic rats.","Coronary Heart Disease; Dadih; Hypocholesterolemic Effect; Lactococcus lactis","Bacteria (microorganisms); Lactococcus; Lactococcus lactis; Lactococcus lactis",,,,,,,"Agarbæk, M., Gerdes, L.U., Richelsen, B., Hypocholesterolaemic effect of a new fermented milk product in healthy middle-aged men (1995) Eur.

Dadih is an Indonesian traditional fermented milk of West Sumatra which is fermented naturally. Viability of the strain is critical in determining the capacity of lactic bacteria to induce immune stimulation as well as to colonize in the intestinal tract. Therefore, LAB are proposed to exert health promoting or probiotic effects in human, such as inhibition of pathogenic microflora, antimutagenic, and the reduction of cholesterol levels. This manuscript reports in vitro probiotic properties of indigenous dadih lactic bacteria, especially some important colonization factors in GI tract, such as lysozyme, acid and bile tolerance. Bile Salt Hydrolase (BSH) activity, spectrum of bacteriocin, and antimutagenic activity of bacterial cells were also assessed. Twenty dadih lactic isolates were screened further for their tolerance to low pH, at pH 2 and 3 as well as their bile tolerance. There were ten isolates classified as acid and bile acid tolerant, and further screened for lysozyme tolerance, BSH activity. The spectrum of bacteriocin activity of isolates was assayed using cell-free neutralized supernatants by agar spot test against variety of pathogens. Lc. lactis subsp. lactis IS-10285, IS-7386, IS-16183, IS-11857 and IS-29862, L. brevis IS-27560, IS-26958 and IS-23427, Leu.mesen.mesenteroides IS-27526, and L. casei IS-7257 each has good survival rate at low pH values and in the presence of lysozyme, and short lag time in the presence of 0.3 % oxgall. Lc. lactis subsp. lactis IS-11857 and IS-29862 each has high BHS activity, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis IS-10285 and IS-16183 each had a positive spectrum of bacteriocin activity against E. coli 3301 and Lysteria monocytogenes ATCC 19112, while L. brevis IS-26958 has high BHS activity as well as positive spectrum of bacteriocin against E. coli 3301, Lysteria monocytogenes ATCC 19112, and S. aureus IFO 3060. All of the ten dadih lactic strains performed in vitro acid and bile tolerance, indicating a possibility to reach the intestine alive, and display probiotic activities.","Aflatoxin; Duck; Fermented Chitin-chitosan; Mycotoxicity; Zearalenone","Anas sp.; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli; Lactobacillus; Lactobacillus brevis; Lactobacillus brevis; Lactobacillus casei; Lactobacillus casei; Lactococcus; Lactococcus lactis; Lactococcus lactis; Leuconostoc; Leuconostoc mesenteroides; Leuconostoc mesenteroides; Listeria; Listeria monocytogenes; Listeria monocytogenes; Staphylococcus; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus aureus",,,,,,,"Benson, G.M., Haskin, N.J., Eckers, C., Moore, P.J., Reid, D.G., Mitchell, R.C., Waghmore, S., Suckling, K.E., Polydeoxycholate in human and hamster feces: A major product of cholate metabolism (1993) J.

Hence, Leuconostoc paramesenteroides R-51 has good prospects as a probiotic starter for cultures.

Furthermore, Terasi, an Indonesian salty fermented fish and/or shrimp paste was found to be mutagenic by means of the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 streptomycin dependent strain SD 510. Antimutagenicity of milk cultured with lactic acid bacteria isolated from Dadih against Terasi, and the relationship between the antimutagenicity and its growth parameters were studied. In general, milk cultured with various strains of lactic acid bacteria from Dadih displayed antimutagenicity against Terasi extract over a wide range of percentages by pre-treatment, whereas no antimutagenicity was detected by post-treatment. This means that milk cultured with lactic acid bacteria from Dadih suppressed mutagenesis in a desmutagenic manner. Milk cultured with Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei R-52 showed the highest inhibition and demonstrated the highest number of viable counts after incubation at 30°C for 12 h in a time course study. Hence, cell counts may play a vital role in inhibiting mutagenicity.

The higher the heating temperature and the longer the heating time, the more mutagenicity observed in both terasi and its starter, and the highest mutagenic activity was shown by heating each of them at 100°C for 60 min. Terasi starter has stronger mutagenic properties as compared to terasi. Indonesian jasmine tea, which is a yellow tea, was examined for its antimutagenic properties against mutagenic terasi. Tea component presented in fraction C (water soluble, chloroform and ethyl acetate insoluble fraction) as well as in fraction D (water soluble, chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol insoluble fraction) were found to suppress the mutagenicities exerted by heated terasi and heated terasi starter. Yet, the tea components presented in fraction E (chloroform soluble fraction) were found to enhance the mutagenicity of terasi.","Antimutagenicity; Indonesian jasmine tea; Mutagenicity; Salmonella typhimurium SD 510; Terasi; Terasi starter","acetic acid ethyl ester; butanol; chloroform; terasi; unclassified drug; article; bacterial mutation; controlled study; heating; Indonesia; jasmine tea; mutagenic activity; mutagenicity; nonhuman; Salmonella; Salmonella typhimurium; tea; temperature; time",,"acetic acid ethyl ester, 141-78-6; butanol, 35296-72-1, 71-36-3; chloroform, 67-66-3",,"Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte, MECD","Ingrid S.

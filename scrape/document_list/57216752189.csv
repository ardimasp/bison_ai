Based on data released by databoks.id the three biggest e-commerce sites in Indonesia are Tokopedia, Bukalapak, and Shopee. In keeping its market competitive, e-commerce must know effective ways of satisfying customer wants and needs. A huge number of monthly visits prove that customer satisfaction in online business is a key factor in profitability. Therefore, this study examines several variables, including Website Design, Website Security, Information Quality, and Perceived Ease of Use, that affect customer satisfaction and its effect on online purchase intention. Sampling totaling 400 respondents, including 168 Tokopedia respondents, 141 Bukalapak respondents, and 92 Shopee respondents and questionnaires were distributed in DKI Jakarta. All questionnaire data were analyzed using Smart PLS 3.0 with the Partial Least Square method. The results showed that perceived ease of use has a significant effect on customer satisfaction, and customer satisfaction has a significant effect on online purchase intention. On the other hand, the results showed that website design, website security, and information quality had no significant effect on customer satisfaction. Thus, the findings of this study are expected to help e-commerce to implement the right strategy to keep competing in e-commerce in Indonesia, especially Jakarta. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Originally, kombucha made from a combination of sweetened tea that mixed with a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast to ferment. Moreover, the making of kombucha starts to vary through an infusion method such as herbs infusion, flowers or fruits, and vegetable mixture, and even to substitute with the coffee ground. Indonesia is the fifth largest consumer of coffee in the world. Therefore, this article aims to study an upcycling of leftover coffee grounds to produce kombucha. This form of fermentation method with inoculum Kombucha tea, which then known as Kombucha coffee (KC). The empiric study was conducted using a quantitative method, where a secondary data was supported with the primary result of questionnaires to eighty panelists. The findings of this research suggested that the aroma and taste of KC widely accept by the respondents. Additionally, KC's aroma, taste, and texture proved more hedonic value than tea kombucha. Although the study has a limitation such as time and the number of respondents. But, the result of the study stimulates a further discussion to investigate the significance of KC towards business and economic benefits. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Saxe, L., (2019) Fermented foods are up 149%-as long as they're unfamiliar"", , Https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizzysaxe/2019/02/06/fermented-foods-are-up-149-percent-as-long-as-theyre-unfamiliar, Forbes.com, February 6, [Online].

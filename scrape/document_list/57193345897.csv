Johannes Itten’s theory of color serves as a thinking base in this study. The theory is reflected in the cultures of Indonesia, and represented by island of Sumatera (Aceh DA, Medan, Padang, Bengkulu, Palembang, and Lampung). The scope of the subject matters is limited to traditional textile products such as traditional costumes and bridal apparel, and culinary. The textile products are chosen because they become reflection of a culture whose place is close to society, and its color become the society’s own identity. The research method is qualitative, consist of literature study, experts interviews (historians and artists), and visiting cultural centers especially the ones associated with textile and culinary product. The result of the study is presented in the form of morphological matrix on cultural color. The matrix is supported with arguments and classroom experiments which allows students to use, cultivate, and maximize the method of applying color in visual communication to achieve harmony and contrast. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Cultural analysis; Island of Sumatera; Local color; Morphological matrix",,,,,"Binus University","This work was supported in part by Bina Nusantara University under Grant.","Dar Maprawira, S., (2002) Warna: Teori Dan Kreatifitas Penggunaannya Bandung ITB, pp. 42-43; Dinata, S., (2010), http://elib.unikom.ac.id/files/disk1/457/jbptunikompp-gdl-septyandin-22827-2-unikom_s-i.pdf, Retrieved November 7, 2014; Fraser, T., Banks, A., (2004) The Complete Guide to Color, , Ilex Press Ltd., UK; Feisner, E.A., (2000) Colour: How to Use Colour in Art and Design, pp. 121-122. , Laurence King Publishing, London; Van Leeuwen, T., (2011) The Language of Colour, pp. 43-44. , Routledge, Oxon; Finding Your Dominant Colour Personality, , https://unifiedspace.wordpress.com/2011/05/19/finding-your-dominantcolour-personality, (2011, May 19); Stone, T.E., Adams, S., Morioka, N., (2006) Color Design Workbook: A Real-World Guide to Using Color in Graphic Design, 46, 18p. , Rockport Publishers, Inc., London; Van Hagen Itten, E., (1970) The Element of Color Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, New York, Cincinnati, Toronto, 92p. , London, Melbourne; Ma’Arif, J., (2013) Bertahan Di Tengah Gempuran Teknologi, , http://bengkuluekspress.com/bertahan-ditahan-gempuranteknologi, Retrieved November 7, 2014; Woolman, M., (2009) 100 Visual Ideas Color Combinations, 7p. , APB Ltd., Surrey; Kuno, N., (1999) FORMS Inc., Color in Context, Graphic-Sha Pub.

The plant has multiple uses and can re-generate by itself ensuring its continuity to meet ongoing needs. However, the tradition of using bamboo is not further explored in respect to the progressive development of creative design and function in the era of today’s modern technology. Evidently, the use of bamboo in rural areas is often used to make simple tools with similar traditional designs for everyday life. In retrospect to the above issues, this study is aimed to introduce the used of bamboo for material furniture in rural area in Indonesia. It uses a research by method of collecting data through surveys, literature review, interviews and training to determine the types of bamboo use for material furniture in rural area. The results of this study is intended to show that the use of bamboo can be further developed into furniture for rural areas to create higher values. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Bamboo; Characteristic of bamboo; Material furniture; Rural area",,,,,,"Acknowledgment submitted to Binus University for supporting the writing of this paper and hopefully this paper can be useful for the readers and contributed to the development of bamboo furniture in Indonesia.","Larasati, D., (1999) Uncovering the Green Gold of Indonesia: A Design Research on Bamboo’s Potential, 65p; Sonjaya, J.A., (2014) Bamboo Workshop Paper Collection UGM Centre of Asia Pacific Studies and Bambubos, Yogjakarta, pp. 9-24; Sulastiningsih, I.M., Santoso, A., (2012) Jurnal Penelitian Hasil Hutan, 30, p. 199; Arinasa, I.B.K., Peneng, D.I.N., (2013) Jenis-Jenis Bambu Di Bali Dan Potensinya, , LIPI Press, Jakarta; Sofiana, Y., Octaviana, R.C., (2014) Kajian Teknis Pengolahan Material Bambu Menjadi Material Siap Pakai Bagi Industri Desain, , Research Report Grant, Binus University, Jakarta; Sulastiningsih, I.M., Dan Krisdianto, A.S., (2014) Pembuatan Produk Bambu Komposit, , Pusat penelitian dan pengembangan keteknikan kehutanan dan pengolahan hasil hutan.

Through our on-going community project that develops recycled craft products in the interest of obtaining extra income for the mothers of Penjaringan, Jakarta, obstacles and prospects of employing participatory design method has been identified. The method which is known to bring the whole stakeholders into the design process is now preferred when the end product is intended to respond the real needs of its users. However, for such methods to be successful, designers in charge to work with underprivileged citizens must understand that they will be working under very different conditions than when doing participatory design in an established society. There are economical (quantitative) as well as cultural (qualitative) discrepancies among plural settlers of Jakarta, where the underprivileged suffers the least access to good quality infrastructure, which in turn affecting their self-actualization, aesthetic sensibilities and workmanships. Our field study revealed that participatory design methods may be advantageous only if the designers firstly take the lead and empower those who have been hindered economically and culturally, before we can expect them to participate in the design process optimally. As long as the empowerment process is carried out, we realized that participatory design with underprivileged citizens of developing countries has a prospect to bring out outcomes of at least two types: First, products that suits participant’s existing socio-economical condition, and second, the empowered design process itself improves citizens’ workmanships valuable for their own future productivities. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Developing countries; Empowerment; Participatory design; Unprivileged citizen",,,,,,,"(2015), http://regionalinvestment.bkpm.go.id/newsipid/ekonomiumrd.php?ia, (Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board), UMR Daerah, Retrieved September; Denzin, N.K., Lincoln, Y.S., (2007) Handbook of Qualitative Research, , (eds.), 3rd edn., Thousand Oaks, Sage, CA; Fals-Borda, O., Rahman, M.A., (1991) Action and Knowledge: Breaking the Monopoly with Participatory Action Research, pp. viiivii-viii. , Preface, edited by O.

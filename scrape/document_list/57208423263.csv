Political communication between the Commission I of the Indonesian House of Representatives (DPR) and the Ministry of Defense in order to ensure that the discussion of the National Resource Management Bill (PSDN) for National Defense does not encounter obstacles is something that needs to be done. This study uses a qualitative method, where primary data is obtained from observations on political dynamics in the discussion of a draft state defense policy which is then outlined in the PSDN Bill, while secondary data is obtained from various literature studies. The results of this study show that between the House of Representatives and the Ministry of Defense has established a good political communication process in the discussion of the PSDN Bill; this condition has led to a good understanding and synergy between the two institutions in formulating the PSDN Bill for defense. It is important for political communicators to build effective political communication by making clear and precise political messages, this is certainly so that the political message can be easily understood by the communicant. © 2018 CEJISS.","Defense; House of representatives; Ministry of defense; Political communication; PSDN bill",,,,,,,,,,"Metropolitni Univerzita Praha",,,,,1802548X,,,,"English","Cent.

This is because to simplify the decision-making process, one of which is the determination of prospective credit customers at Bank ABC. Bank ABC is one of the financial institutions in the growth phase needed to improve the quality of safe, high-quality and accurate credit. The purpose of this study is to accelerate the decision making process of credit customers, namely whether credit is accepted or rejected. One method used is CRISP-DM as standart processes for data mining. Election algorithm using the C4.5 decision tree algorithm. The final result of this study is the prediction of the pattern of credit results for credit customers. This pattern is generated from decision tree is expexted to be a reference for credit customer take a credit at Bank ABC. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Almost all payment transactions already use technology, especially in the banking industry. One of the activities of financial transactions in banks is electronification of bill payment transactions and this has become a matter of special concern such as school / university bill payment transactions, tax bill payment transactions, drinking water company bill payment transactions, etc. To accelerate the process of integrating bill payment transactions into all payment provider companies online, of course must use the right concept so that the system can be more effective and efficient, namely using the concept of service oriented architecture (SOA) by using the enterprise service bus (ESB). ESB is used in order to integrate the banking system with the bill payment transaction billing system. In this research the Service Oriented Modeling and Architecture (SOMA) methodology will be applied as a guide in implementing SOA-based solutions. SOA was chosen because it has the nature of interoperability so that it can be relied upon in developing online bill payment transaction systems between bank systems and other systems despite having different system platforms. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Thus, the aim is also including information gathering about all needs to do genset monitoring activity. Application s advantage is to facilitate genset technician in monitoring multi genset wherever they are only by using an interface. Methodology used are literature reviews and field studies. Result of this research is a daemon application that actively monitor all gensets which area connected each other, a database for data monitoring, and web server which determine a real time information recall despite of its easiness since it can be accessed through web browser. Multi generator set monitoring using one single screen surely can improve the effectiveness and efficiency monitoring work. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Controller-area network; Generator set controller; Modbus",,,,,,"Axelson, J., (2000) Serial Port Complete: Programming and Circuits for RS-232 and RS-485 Links and Networks, Lake View Research, , Madison, WI; Djunaidi, R.J., Jonathan, Y., Gendri, W., (2007) Control and Monitor Multi Genset Based on Modbus Protocol via Local Network, , Indonesia; Forouzan, B.A., (2007) Data Communications and Networking, , 4th Edition, McGraw-Hill Education, Singapore; Intellicom Innovation, , http://www.intellicom.se/modbus.shtml, Modbus; (2009) XAMPP, , www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html, Kai 'Oswald' Seidler; (2008) Introduction to RS485, , http://www.lammertbies.nl/comm/info/RS-485.html; (2008) History of the Modbus Protocol, , http://www.lammertbies.nl/comm/info/modbus.html; Middleton, G., (2004) Gencomm Standard for Use with Generating Set Control Equipment, , Deep Sea Electronics plc, England; Plater, A., (2004) Link 5000 Plus Communications Software Manual, , Deep Sea Electronics plc, England; Stallings, W., (2004) Data and Computer Communications, , 7th Edition, Pearson Education Inc, America; Whitney, J.L., Bentley, L.D., Dittman, K.C., (2004) System Analysis and Design Methods, , 6th Edition, McGraw-Hill Companies, USA","School of Computer Science, K.H.

This paper presents the applications of process mining in automotive industry. Using event log data with timestamps, process mining algorithms, like inductive miner and fuzzy miner were able to automatically generate car manufacturing processes, automatically checking the conformance between the actual processes and the predefined standard ones, and identify and solve any bottlenecks and issues in the car manufacturing processes. A number of car manufacturing issues were considered in this research, such as process delays, stagnant workflow, mismanagement, faulty production and labor insufficiency. The modeling and statistical results show promising leverage of process mining in automotive industry that can lead to the autonomous car manufacturing with abilities for real-time process auditing and reengineering. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,"Binus University: 033/VR, RTT/IV/2019","This research has been conducted and funded through a research grant program supported by Bina Nusantara University with a number of 033/VR.RTT/IV/2019.","van der Aalst, W.

The fast development of fintech startups on creating payment gateway and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending applications is one of examples for the modern disruptive innovations affecting to traditional financial business. The problem arises when the digital disruption affects the bank's business models due to change in customer trends with additional impacts to conventional companies. This paper presents the quantitative approaches like statistical hypothesis testing and analysis of regression using convenient random sampling for better analyzing the impacts of fintech on conventional banking industry in Indonesia. A number of important and realistic variables, such as customer satisfaction, net promotion score, promotion, ease of use, etc., were considered in this research in order to find a variety of the value propositions that dominantly influence to the adoption of fintech or banking products. The results show that the banks have been disrupted by the payment fintech since the emergence of fintech companies in around 2015, mainly due to superior value propositions, like promotion with standardized beta value of 0.349 and wide range of merchants with 0.153, respectively. In addition, the fintech startups have digital strategies on adopting a customer-centric mindset and developing a product that gives their customer a high customer satisfaction. However, in the current time, P2P fintechs do not have that significant disruption to the banks, mainly due to the fact that the customers consider more on safety reasons. © 2019 IEEE.","analysis of regression; customer satisfaction; digital disruption; net promoter score; payment gateway; peer-to-peer","Information management; Peer to peer networks; Sales; Sampling; Testing; analysis of regression; digital disruption; net promoter score; Payment gateways; Peer to peer; Customer satisfaction",,,,,,"Gomber, P., Kauffman, R.J., Parker, C., Weber, B.W., On the fintech revolution: Interpreting the forces of innovation, disruption, and transformation in financial services (2018) Journal of Management Information Systems, 35, pp. 220-265; Demyanyk, Y., Kolliner, D., Peer-to-peer lending is poised to grow (2014) Economic Trends; Paulus, Y.E., The emergence of peer-to-peer lending in Indonesia: A study of risk management analysis on conventional banking companies (2018) International Journal of Management and Applied Science (IJMAS), 4, pp. 34-40; Bunea, S., Kogan, B., Stolin, D., Banks vs fintech: At last, it's official' (2016) Journal of Financial Transformation, 44, pp. 122-131; Temelkov, Z., Fintech firms opportunity or threat for banks?

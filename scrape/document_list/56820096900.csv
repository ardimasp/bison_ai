This paper explores how Asian culture influences the ability of Asian corporations to innovate. Hofstede’s dimensions of national culture are used as the basis for cultural analysis. This paper found that some dimensions of Asian culture support innovation, and some do not. This paper also discusses some facts that Asian countries are rapidly becoming innovation powerhouses, which trigger the need for more research on the specific key cultural factors that fuel Asian innovation. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

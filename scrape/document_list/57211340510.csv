The current system runs by integrating from all stakeholders in the company manually and takes much time and ineffective. The purpose of this study is to create a SOA system as a middleware to integrate desktop, android and web light applications from completion department. The research results is developed into completion application system used to do inspection activity by Quality Control Inspector on the Check sheet Inspection Test Record (ITR) Form directly in the fabricator Site in two main phases, Mechanical Completion and Commissioning phase. SOA will work as a system integrator containing a collection of web services consumed by mobile application and web application to help Quality Control Admins and Inspectors improve the effectiveness of their activities. Inspection Test Record (ITR)/Check sheet Progress will be updated in conjunction with the check sheet inspected and approved from the mobile application by the inspector at fabricator site. So, there is no redundant activities any more in updating ITR/Check sheet Progress. The results show the duration process of inspection activity decreased significantly. © 2019 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Checksheet; Commissioning; Inspection Test Record; Quality Control; SOA",,,,,,"In-Hwan Choi, D.C., Reliability and availability assessment of seabed storage tanks using fault tree analysis (2016) Ocean Eng, 120, pp. 1-14. , 1 July 2016; Pandele, P., All-electric FPSO: Onshore and offshore commissioning experience (2016) 2016 Petroleum and Chemical Industryt Conference Europe (PCIC Europe), pp. 1-9; Bogner, J., Zimmermann, A., Towards Integrating Microservices with Adaptable Enterprise Architecture (2016) Proc. -IEEE Int.

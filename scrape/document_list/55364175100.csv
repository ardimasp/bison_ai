Estimates for Bayes spatio-temporal modeling are still using the MCMC algorithm which requires a long computational time and becomes inappropriate to use if the model is hierarchically compiled and involves many parameters. This paper aims to predict the unobserved locations with fast, accurate and current developed estimation that is INLA. The modeling algorithms are divided into 3 main steps, Gamma distribution for overall data, Bernoulli for extreme data identification and Generalized Pareto for extreme data. To produce accurate predictive values, we innovatively purpose improvisations in determining spatial and temporal smoothing parameters, as well as determining the extreme value threshold using Measure of Surprise method. The spatio-temporal data is the monthly rainfall of 57 locations from West Java, Indonesia, observed from 1981-2017. The model produces satisfactory results: the spatio-temporal modeling improves the estimation of rainfall in many missing and completely unobserved data with the correlation between predictive and validation values about from 0.8 and RMSEP 137-195 mm for average to extreme rainfall, and 0.7 with RMSEP 224-229 mm for high extreme rainfall.

GCM data is generally ill-conditioned, which is high dimension and multicollinearity, so a special technique is needed to handle this poorly conditioned. One of the variable selection techniques and handling of multicollinearity which is currently highly developed is regularization techniques including Adaptive Lasso, where selective parameters are adaptive, which can differ for each regression coefficient. Until now, predictions of extreme rainfall in Indonesia have not used Adaptive Lasso in SD modeling. This paper aims to predict the amount of rainfall (in millimeters) at moderate extreme (quantile 0.75) and high extreme rainfall (quantile 0.9 da 0.95) and handling poorly conditioned GCM data with Adaptive Lasso techniques and building predictive models of local rainfall by utilizing GCM data using the Bayes quantile regression model.

Involving big datasets, the complexity of Bayes spatio-temporal modeling could lead inefficient performance from Bayesian inference via MCMC. This paper aims to predict rainfall in observed and unobserved locations using Bayes spatio-temporal model with the inference of INLA, which has proven capable of providing fast and accurate results. The response variable is monthly rainfall from 57 locations in West Java Indonesia, observed from 1981 - 2017 and assumed to have normal distribution. Our spatio-temporal modeling based on additive framework, which can capture the spatial and temporal random effect as explanatory variables. The spatial random effects are a realization of Gaussian process with spatial dependency follow Matérn model, and the temporal random effects are assumed to have annually cyclic and follow random walk of order two. The model shows satisfying results: the spatio-temporal model able to predict rainfall even for unobserved locations using the spatio-temporal characteristics from nearly locations with the correlation between predicted and real data sets is about 0.7 - 0.8 for high to low quantile with RMSE is about 294 for high quantile. © 2019 The Authors.

When the ordinal data have monotone manner across cut-points, proportional odds assumption become less appropriate. The lack of proportionality may be possible captured using trend odds model which have constrained structural relationship between the odds and the cut-points. This paper describes briefly cumulative odds which are the foundation of trend odds model and demonstrates algebraically the trend odds model related to latent logistic and uniform distribution to obtain the explicit form of slope of the trend. A data set is used to illustrate the interpretation of trend odds model, we apply this model to cigarettes consumption which has monotone manner across cut-points that seems the proportional assumption is more likely not appropriate. However, characteristic of ordinal data that fit trend odds model properly must be specified because only monotone manner is insufficient. We perform simulation using PROC NLMIXED in SAS system and find that ordinal data must significantly monotone for unexposed group and the ratio between covariates is higher for higher level cut-points. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Spatio-temporal models presented in this paper are designed with hierarchical fashion and estimated with INLA (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation) as the current estimation method for Bayesian analysis. INLA based on latent Gaussian posterior distribution which provides great computational benefit and solve the convergence issue in MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) algorithm. We model the poverty data set using classical, dynamic and space-time interaction of spatio-temporal models, and investigate the poverty relationship with socio-economics predictors.

In poverty parameter estimations, the less of sample adequacy to deliver direct estimation is one of the limitation, thus the Small Area Estimation (SAE) developed to handle it. Since, the small area estimation techniques require ""borrow strength"" across the neighbor areas furthermore SAE was developed by integrating spatial information into the model, named as Spatial SAE.

Bayesian method to deal with spatial and spatio-temporal data extensively approach with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), however, when models are complex and designed with hierarchical fashion, MCMC algorithms may be extremely slow and even become computationally unfeasible. The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) algorithm is current development in R-INLA package in R, designed to deal with fundamental limitation of MCMC computation. This paperpurpose to investigate how the socioeconomic information (i.e. population density, expectation years ofschooling and construction overpriced index) effect the number of poor people in East Java province, Indonesia, using Bayes spatial model. Investigation result that expectation years of schooling has greatesteffect in reducing number of poor people. Not only on its spatial pattern, we also investigate timedependency of poor people data from years 2012 to 2016 using classical, dynamic and space-timeinteraction of Bayes spatio-temporal models. In this paper, the computational aspect is efficiently solvedwith R-INLA, resulting dynamic Bayes Spatio-temporal is the best model based on the smallest DevianceInformation Criteria. © IEOM Society International.","Areal data; Conditional autoregressive; Gaussian markov random field; Generalized extreme value; Integrated nested laplace approximation; Markov Chain Monte Carlo; Random walk",,,,,,,,"Rachmawati, R.N.; Statistics Department, Kebun Jeruk Raya No. 27, Indonesia; email: rofah.nr@binus.ac.id",,"Eaton;INFORMS (Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences);Siemens","IEOM Society","8th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management, IEOM 2018","6 March 2018 through 8 March 2018",,138293,21698767,9781532359446,,,"English","Proc.

This paper briefly describes growth curves model as a single LMM that represent two levels of observation, which focused on modeling its covariance structure to capture correlated information over time of individual performance. We apply LMM and model different types of its covariance structure in the simulation study of children's growth differences based on the feeding methods. We perform simulation scenario using MIXED procedure in SAS system, based on three fit indices (-2RLL, AIC and SBC) and p-value significance level, we obtain Unstructured (UN) covariance is always be the best fit in presenting the characteristic of data but not the best choice considering inefficient numbers of parameters while Heterogeneous First-order Autoregressive (ARH(1)) is a proper alternative covariance structure with ease of data interpretation from fewer numbers of estimated parameters. © 2017 The Authors.

This method includes three main concepts, the concepts of fuzzy, time series and Markov chain. Fuzzy concepts are useful to classify variables, time series concept to observe the JCI movement during a particular period and Markov chain concept is used in process prediction of JCI values using the transition probability matrix. To assist the analysis of predictions, we design a web-based application that aims to predict by analyzing a JCI data set closing price on a certain period, so that the process can be more efficient, thorough and practical. We compare the accuracy of FTMC and prediction powered from Song and Chissom.

It can be used to identify groups of people who have a high mortality risk. Identifying group is important to compare the characteristics of human that have high and low risk. These characteristics can be seen from the factors that influenced it. Furthermore, there are factors which influence of birth and death child, such us economic, health facility, education, and others. The influence factors of every individual are different, but there are similarities some individuals which live close together or in the close locations. It means there was spatial effect. To identify group in this research, clustering is done by spatial cluster method, which is view to considering the influence of the location or the relationship between locations. One of spatial cluster method is Spatial 'K'luster Analysis by Tree Edge Removal (SKATER). The research was conducted in Bogor Regency, West Java. The goal was to get a cluster of districts based on the factors that influence birth and death child. SKATER build four number of cluster respectively consists of 26, 7, 2, and 5 districts.

Option price determination is affected by risk factor. However in Black-Scholes model option price is determined without arbitrage risk affection so it is impossible to take return. In this study, option price formula is constructed to be more represent the condition of financial market using incomplete market concept where financial asset, that is traded, is affected by arbitrage risk so it is possible for market participants to take return. European call option is defined by Esscher Transform method and option price formula is determined by changing its form to linear approximation. The result from this study is option price formula with linear approximation has some privileges.

Beside that we also construct the statistical properties of the estimator. Approach: It is considered the worst case where there is only available a single realization of the Poisson process having intensity which consist of a periodic component and a power function trend, observed in the interval [0,n]. It is assumed that the period of the periodic component and the slope of the power function trend are known. Results: It has been formulated the estimator and asymptotic approximations to the bias and variance of the estimator. Conclusion: The estimator that we construct is asymptotically unbiased estimator for a periodic component of the intensity function of a periodic Poisson process in the presence of a power function trend. © 2012 Science Publications.","Asymptotic normality; Intensity function; Several nonparametric methods; Statistical properties; Unbiased estimator",,,,,,,"Helmers, R., Mangku, I.W., (2000) Statistical estimation of poisson intensity function, pp. 9-21. , Proceedings of the SEAM-GMU Intenational Conference on Mathematics and its Applications, Jul. 26-29, Yogyakarta; Helmers, R., Mangku, I.W., Estimating the intensity of a cyclic Poisson process in the presence of linear trend (2009) Ann.

Face recognition and tracking are important features for vision-based service robot in order to obtain detailed information about people around the robot and do specific action based on the task given before. We have developed and introduced successfully three main modules to train faces online, to recognize and track faces. The system consists of stereo camera and able to recognize and track face using 2 servos as actuators. In our scenario, online training for faces conducted using PCA to store information of the people. We propose a probabilistic model using Bayesian Filtering for this system and combined with controller using ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System) controller with 2 inputs ( x and y coordinates) and 2 output to tracks the people s face smoothly.

A group of people who are walking will be tracked as multiple moving obstacles. Predefined maneuver to avoid obstacles applied to robot because the limitation of view angle from stereo camera to detect obstacles. The contribution of this research is a new method for multiple moving obstacle avoidance strategy with Bayesian approach using stereo vision based on the direction and speed of obstacles.

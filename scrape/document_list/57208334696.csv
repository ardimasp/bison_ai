Population of this research is 427 Jakarta residents that had downloaded DU Battery Saver. SEM-PLS method was used to measure the relationship and influence between variables in this research. The findings showed there’s a strong relationship and a significant effect of corporate image and consumer perceived value on consumer attitude. But brand personality doesn’t have direct impact on the intention to use the DU Battery Saver. Therefore, the moderating variable, namely consumer attitude, had a strong relationship and a significant effect on intention to use. © 2018 Universiti Putra Malaysia.

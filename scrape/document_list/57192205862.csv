YouTube video has some characteristics on number of views, likes, dislikes and comments. Association rules mining able to find the most dominant item in a dataset. This research investigates 40 random videos on YouTube by implementing association rules mining algorithm to find what is the most ingredients used in Indonesia cooking recipes. This research found that the most liked video use 2 main ingredient which are garlic and onion. This research also implements IST-EFP algorithm for reducing the dimensional of the dataset without loss on important rules obtained. This research found IST-EFP able to reduce 19% on dataset dimension with 0.7% loss on rules obtained. © 2018 IEEE.","association rule mining; cooking recipes ingredients; IST-EFP algorithm; YouTube dataset","Association rules; Data mining; Pattern recognition; Websites; Association rules mining; Cooking recipe; Indonesia; Number of views; YouTube; Cooking",,,,,"Kosla, C., (2016) YouTube Data Analysis Using Hadoop, , California State University, California; Bolanos, M., Ferra, A., Radeva, P., Food ingredients recognition through multi-label learning (2017) International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing, Catania; Siswanto, B., Liong, T.H., Shaufiah, Dimensionality reduction for association rule mining with IST-EFP algorithm (2015) International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT), , Bali; Shaufiah, Siswanto, B., Association rule mining for identifying dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and typhoid fever (TF) disease with IST-EFP algorithm (2016) International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT), , Bandung; Drzymala, P., Wiak, S., Welfle, H., Using ORACLE tools to generate multidimensional model in warehouse (2012) Przeglad Elektrotechniczny, 88, pp. 257-262; Shrivastava, R., Saxena, G.K., Patidar, K., Implementation of unified query for big database using SQL on oracle platform (2017) International Journal of Current Innovation Research, 3 (3), pp. 616-621; Xuequn, S., Kai-Uwe, S., Ingolf, G., SQL based frequent pattern mining with fp-growth (2004) 15th International Conference on Applications of Declarative Programming and Knowledge Management, and 18th International Conference on Workshop on Logic Programming, , Potsdam; Fuerstein, S., Pribyl, B., (2009) Oracle PL/SQL Programming, Fifth Edition, , California: O'Reilly Media, Inc; Jan, S.R., Shah, S.T.U., Johar, Z.U., Shah, Y., Khan, F., An innovative approach to investigate various software testing techniques and strategies (2016) International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology, pp. 682-689; Myalapalli, V.K., Teja, B.L.R., High performance PL/SQL programming (2015) International Conference on Pervasive Computing (ICPC); Prabhjot, Sharma, N., Overview of the database management system (2017) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science, pp. 262-269; Pressman, R.S., (2001) Software Engineering A Practitioner's Approach 5th Edition, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Ramakrishnan, R., Gehrke, J., (2000) Database Management Systems Second Edition, , New York: McGraw-Hill College; Saisanguansat, D., Jeatrakul, P., Optimization techniques for PL/SQL (2016) Fourteenth International Conference on ICT and Knowledge Engineering; Memon, M.Q., Jingsha, H., Aasma, Ditta, A., Rana, K.G., Dynamic integration of PL/SQL for complex queries (2016) International Journal of Database Theory and Application, 9 (10), pp. 351-362",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1st Indonesian Association for Pattern Recognition International Conference, INAPR 2018","7 September 2018 through 8 September 2018",,144686,,9781538694220,,,"English","Indones.

To support the company's business processes, XYZ uses two applications to carry out operational activities, namely the CARTOS application to manage invoices and the Finance application to record company costs and revenues. To produce a cost accounting report, XYZ is still processing and visualizing it manually with data sources from the two applications mentioned earlier. This resulted in quite a long time processing data into information. So that reporting to management cannot be done in real time. Therefore XYZ needs a system that can help management to analyze and manage data into information in real time. The Business Intelligence (BI) method is one of the solutions for company needs, especially in analyzing and providing access to data to help make better decisions. This study discusses the design and implementation of business intelligence solutions ranging from architecture, data warehouse, ETL processes and visualization in the form of a dashboard in accordance with the needs of XYZ. The method used in developing business intelligence dashboards refers to the executive information system life cycle method which consists of justification, planning, business analysis, design, construction, and dissemination. The results of this research are dashboard visualization using the Power BI tool that displays information and knowledge needed in the monitoring process and becomes material to produce management decisions related to cost accounting reports. © 2021 F.

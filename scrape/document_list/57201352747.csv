As China's investment in Indonesia expands in various industry sectors, the need for qualified translators escalates. However, the situation described that Indonesia lacks competent and qualified translators in Mandarin. The study adopts the qualitative approach. Technically, the study utilizes a variety of secondary data consisting of documents, books, publications, and website to collect data based on the needs of qualified translators and how to improve their competency. In addition, primary data collection involves industry and translation service providers, from high schools, vocational schools, colleges, and Chinese language courses through interviews. In this respect, the study contributes to the development of the Mandarin Chinese translator competency through professional translator training programs. The competencies developed include Mandarin language skills in a variety of contexts or themes such as business, industry, accounting, taxation, law, and socio-political issues. The findings of this research indicate the significance to complement the lack of knowledge and skills that are not acquired during the college. Importantly, the authors propose a professional interpreter training model to meet the demand of Chinese investors in Indonesia eventually. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data acquisition; Economics; Personnel training; Professional aspects; Program translators; Taxation; Teaching; Chinese investors; Economic relations; Industry sectors; Qualitative approach; Socio-political issues; Training program; Translation services; Vocational schools; Translation (languages)",,,,"Kementerian Riset, Teknologi dan Pendidikan Tinggi","We acknowledge the partial financial support of this research from research project “Strategi Pengembangan Daerah Perbatasan di Kepulauan Riau dalam Rangka Implementasi Indonesia sebagai Poros Maritim Dunia by Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia.","Justin, Y.L., Demystifying the Chinese Economy (2013) The Australian Economic Review, 46 (3), pp. 259-268; Eichengreen, B., Donghyun, P., Kwanho, S., When Fast-Growing Economies Slow Down: International Evidence and Implications for China (2012) Asian Economic Papers, 11 (1), pp. 42-86; Xiaoxi, Z., Kevin, D., The determinants of China's outward foreign direct investment (2011) Emerging Markets Review, 12 (4), pp. 389-398; Cheng-Chwee, K., Multilateralism in China's ASEAN policy: Its evolution, characteristics, and aspiration (2005) Contemporary Southeast Asia, 27 (1), pp. 102-122; http://www.rappler.com/indonesia/ekonomi/158819-5-mega-proyek-investasi-china-indonesia; http://www.bareksa.com/id/text/2015/07/27/investor-china-mulai-kucurkan-dana-bangun-smelter-us410-juta/11009/newsd; Anne, L., Translation Skills and Knowledge - Preliminary Findings of a Survey of Translators and Revisers Working at Inter-governmental Organizations (2012) Meta, 57 (1), pp. 108-113; María, D.L.T., A web-based resource to improve translation skills (1999) ReCALL, 11, pp. 41-49; Mohamed, A.M.A., Assessing Aptitude and Attitude Development in a Translation Skills Course (2012) CALICO Journal, 29, pp. 321-340; Mansoor-Ul-H, H., Ahmad, A., Purpose of dictionary use in professional education: A study of dictionary using habits in medical students (2010) Procedia Social and Behavioural Sciences, 2 (2), pp. 3988-3993; Mustafa, A.B., Behcet, C., Naci, Y., International Journal of Social Sciences & Educational Studies (2014) Smart Phone Assisted Language Learning, 1, pp. 67-71; Chinnery, G.M., Going to the MALL: Mobile assisted language learning (2006) Language Learning &technology, 10, pp. 9-16; Robert, G.J., Emerging Technology Mobile Apps for Language Learning (2011) Language Learning & Technology, 15, pp. 2-11",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","4th International Conference on Friendly City 2017","11 October 2017 through 12 October 2017",,135340,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

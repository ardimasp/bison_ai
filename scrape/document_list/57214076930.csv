This study aimed to investigate the core competencies of online women entrepreneur and verify the effects on their business performance. The study uses two stages of research: explanatory and confirmatory research. The result of explanatory research, has identified two capabilities as a core competency in building superior online business, i.e. partnership development and digital marketing capability.

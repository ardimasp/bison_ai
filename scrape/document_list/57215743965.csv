The purpose of this study is to analyze risks, find out the causes of the risk, and recommend the best mitigation strategies that can be done in the supply chain of SME interior design. The method used for this research is mixed research method and the type of research used is descriptive research. Data analysis was carried out using SCOR level 1 method with HOR approach. Level 1 SCOR is used for activity mapping. The House of Risk (HOR) approach is divided into 2 stages, in which phase 1 begins with identifying the risks of the problems that have been experienced by interior design SMEs in Indonesia. After obtaining the ten cause of risks that exist, measures of severity and correlation will be carried out. Finally, Aggregate Risk Potential (ARP) is calculated to find out the most dangerous cause of risk, which is distance traveled. HOR stage 2 begins with the evaluation of the most dangerous cause of risks from the results of ARP calculations. This stage focuses on choosing the most effective handling strategy, which is to encourage the efficiency of shipping by only making one delivery of goods. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Aggregate risk potential; HOR method; Mitigation; SCOR level 1; Supply chain",,,,,,"Chopra, S., dan Meindl, P., (2013) Supply chain management: Strategy, planning, and operation, , Essex: Pearson Education Limited; Cahyani, Z.D., Wahyu, S.R., Baihaqi, I., Studi Implementasi Model House of Risk (HOR) untuk Mitigasi Risiko Keterlambatan Material dan Komponen Impor pada Pembangunan Kapal Baru (2016) JURNAL TEKNIK ITS, 5 (2); Hugos, M.H., (2011) Essentials of Supply Chain Management, , Canada: John Wiley and Sons, Inc; Bolstroff, P., Rosenbaum, R., (2007) A handbook for dramatic improvement using the, , SCOR model.

Keeping radiation dose as low as fairly achievable, in step with the diagnostic task, remains the foremost necessary strategy for decreasing this potential risk. In Medical Image process, the aspect impact of radiation the foremost difficult task of CT angiography, is to own wonderful temporal resolution so as to cut back motion artefacts caused by unsteady heart beat and a high spatial resolution to differentiate little coronary structures. However this can be not achieved in CT angiography, as quick scanning takes place and a few of the views could be skipped throughout acquisition so as to realize high temporal resolution. The quantity of pixels in a very reconstructed image is usually unrelated to the particular spatial resolution of the image, this results in poor spatial resolution. This discrepancy may end up in interpretation and inaccuracies throughout the designation. During this analysis work we have a tendency to propose Wright Huang-extremely strained back Projection (HYPR) formula as most promising dose reduction technique. The planned technique involves generation of composite image that exhibits higher spatial resolution created from underneath sampled, high temporal and poor spatial resolution time slices of CTA. Then a weight image is built that possess smart temporal characteristics. Multiplication of weight and composite image ends up in HYPR image. We have a tendency to measure the ensuing image quality of the developed formula through mean sq. error and modulation transfers operate. The CTA dataset were collected from native diagnostic centre yet as from on-line analysis community. Our experimental results have indicated that the strategy will cut back the quantity of projections by 50-75% whereas achieving comparable or higher image quality than the standard reconstructions. We have a tendency to additionally analyse the most impact and interaction impact of input factors over responses exploitation applied mathematics analysis by Mat lab software package. © 2018 IEEE.","Cardiac CT angiography; Composite image; Divided image; Highly constrained back projection; Low dose imaging; Spatial resolution; Temporal; Under sampling; Weight image","Angiography; Heart; Image quality; Image reconstruction; Image resolution; Medical imaging; Risk assessment; Back projection; Cardiac CT; Composite images; Divided image; Low dose; Spatial resolution; Temporal; Under-sampling; Weight image; Computerized tomography",,,,,"Lump, S.P., Tripe, R.K., Obscure, R.W., Castellano, E.A., Clayton, B., Hamilton, M.H., Morgan-Hughes, G.J., Nicol, E.D., The foolproof brook of CT coronary Xray photography in of age patients inGB imaging departments.

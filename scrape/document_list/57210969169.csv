Its wide applications in many research fields have motivated many researchers to propose a plethora of clustering algorithms. K-medoids are a prominent clustering algorithm as an improvement of the predecessor, K-Means algorithm. Despite its widely used and less sensitive to noises and outliers, the performance of K-medoids clustering algorithm is affected by the distance function. This paper presents experimentation findings to compare the performance of K-medoids clustering algorithm using Euclidean, Manhattan and Chebyshev distance functions. In this study the K-medoids algorithm was tested using the village status dataset from Gorontalo Province, Indonesia. Execution time and Davies Bouldin Index were used as performance metrics of the clustering algorithm. Experiment results showed that methods of Manhattan distance and Euclidean distance with the Index Davies value of 0.050. © 2020 IEEE.","Clustering; Euclidean dan Chebyshev; K-Medoids; Manhattan; Village Status","Green manufacturing; Industrial internet of things (IIoT); Davies-Bouldin index; Distance functions; Euclidean distance; K-medoids algorithms; K-medoids clustering; Manhattan distance; Observation data; Performance metrics; K-means clustering",,,,,"Lloyd, S.P., Least squares quantization in PCM (1982) IEEE Trans.

This indicates the need for funding and development assistance. Regarding to the village development, the government and regional government must provide information about which villages should be prioritized for development. The Village Potential or 'Potensi Desa' statistics dataset in 2014 (Podes 2014) at Bekasi regency are released by the Central Bureau of Statistics in the form of unsupervised data consisting of 182 villages and 41 indicators. The Podes 2014 data is collected based on village specific levels in Indonesia by making the village a unit of analysis. By using the k-means algorithm, village status can be determined in Bekasi Regency. The data clustering using k-means is done by calculating the closest distance from a data to a centroid point. This study comparison of distance calculation methods on k-means using Manhattan, Euclidean and Chebychev will be made. Tests will be carried out using Davies Bouldin index and execution time. Based on the tests result, Euclidean metric has most optimum value of Davies Index and efficient execution time compared to Manhattan and Chebyshev metrics. © 2019 IEEE.","Chebychev; Clustering; Euclidean; K-means; Manhattan; Village Label","Artificial intelligence; Rural areas; Chebychev; Clustering; Euclidean; K-means; Manhattans; K-means clustering",,,,,"(1945) State of the Republic of Indonesia, , 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia; (2014) Republic of Indonesia State Law, , Number 6 of 2014, Regarding Villages, President of the Republic of Indonesia; (2017) The Finance Ministry Smart Book for Village Funds, pp. 17-23. , the Village Fund for People's Welfare, Jakarta, Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia; Surjaya, A.M., Seven Subdistricts in Bekasi Regency Indicated Slum, , https://metro.sindonews.com/read/1188962/171/tujuh-kecamatan-dikabupaten-bekasi-Terindikasi-kumuh-1489659175, sindownews.com, 16 March 2017.

Companies have dealt with these massive changes. However, ICanStudioLive, a music company, viewed these from a different perspective. Instead of adopting a wait-and-see approach, they looked at opportunities to create value differentiation using Blue Ocean strategy, though unconsciously. This study used mixed research methods with sequential explanatory approach. Data was obtained from 50 music groups in addition to in-depth interviews with selected management. The SWOT analysis and PMS mapping were used to analyse the data. The results showed ICanStudioLive was practising differentiation strategy akin to Blue Ocean strategy. They were leading in divergence, differentiation, innovation, human resources and motivation compared with their two closest competitors. These variables helped their marketing programme leading to value differentiation. The PMS Mapping showed IcanStudioLive was a pioneer and they should develop and apply the value differentiation to implement the Blue Ocean strategy. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Blue Ocean; Innovation and changing media technology; Marketing strategy; Music industry; Value differentiation",,,,,,"Alhaddi, H., Blue ocean strategy and sustainability for strategic management (2014) International Proceedings of Economics Development and Research, 82, p. 125; Anggadwita, G., Saragih, R., Alamanda, D.T., Competitive strategy of creative application content in the ASEAN economic community:SoftwareDevelopmentusingSWOT Analysis in Indonesia (2016) Pertanika International Journal of Economics and Management, 10, pp. 95-107; Benner, M., Developing economies with industrial policy: Towards a toolbox for economic growth (2013) With Case Studies of Jordan and Egypt, , https://doi.org/10.5897/JAERD12.088, Working Paper.

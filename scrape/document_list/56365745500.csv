However, the existing system lacks an alert system feature to manage the correct meal plan and the delayed in reporting it. Additionally, the current program also lacks expert nutritionists who can determine the appropriate nutritional and dietary compositions. This study aimed to design a more efficient and complete model for Nutrition Management and Diet Monitoring Information System, closely based on nutritional guidelines and applications implemented at health care facilities. The model is a food serving system with an expert component enhanced with a meal registration system via contactless smart cards. © Medwell Journals, 2014.","Alert feature; Diet monitoring; Food composition; Information system; Nutrition management",,,,,,"Ahmed, S., Bartlett, S.J., Ernst, P., Pare, G., Kanter, M., Effect of a web-based chronic disease management system on asthma control and health-related quality of life: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (2011) Trials J, 12; Church, S.M., The history of food composition databases (2006) Br.

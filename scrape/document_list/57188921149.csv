Well managed and integrated public transportation will be an important thing for achieving sustained economic growth and a reduction in rural poverty. Purpose of this study is to provide an application that can help people to access information of public transportation routes in rural and underdeveloped regions. In addition, people will also get information about cost and distance estimation. Method- ology used in this study is Waterfall which consists of data collection, design and analysis, development, and evaluation. Result of this study is an application that provides public transportation routes shown on the map, so that users can reach the initial shuttle point from his/her current position to the destination point.

Learning materials are mostly available in form of book and anatomy mannequin (puppet), but it is still insufficient enough to help students in understanding human body anatomy. Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that combines a real thing into virtual environment interactively. This research purpose is to develop an AR application for human body anatomy learning to be more interesting and easier for student to understand. This application enables student to learn human body anatomy with 3D object interaction while previously using textbook and mannequin. Research method in for this study is by using quantitative method that collects data and then develops the prototype to prove the impact. Application development method is done by using waterfall method that includes planning (collect data and analysis), design (user interface and diagram), implementation, and testing. Research result is AR application for human body anatomy learning that contains 3D object, organ explanation and position that can be accessible on web. © 2018 The Author(s).","3D object; augmented reality; human anatomy; human organ","Artificial intelligence; Augmented reality; Students; User interfaces; Virtual reality; 3D object; Application development; Human anatomy; Human organs; Junior high schools; Learning materials; Quantitative method; Web-based augmented realities; E-learning",,,,,,"Siltanen, S., (2012) Theory and Applications of Marker-based Augmented Reality, , Technical Research Centre of Finland 39; Juan, C., Beatrice, F., Cano, J., An augmented reality system for learning the interior of the human body (2008) Advanced Learning Technologies, 2008.

However,there are still many problems to deal with, such as pests and diseases, especially for paddy which is an important crop because it is the main food for people in Indonesia. Many things have been done by the government to solve that problem, but it has not been resolved because of the lack of knowledge of Indonesian farmers. This research proposes a new way to solve that problem by applying optimized Fuzzy Logic (Fuzzy K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means) with Bee Colony to get pest and disease classifications for paddy based on existing symptoms. Bee Colony will be used to determine the initial centroid for Fuzzy Logic. The proposed approach is evaluated based on the accuracy by comparing the value of Mean Square Error (MSE) and the accuracy of every method for pest and disease classifications. MSE of the new model is smaller than regular Fuzzy Logic by 0.016 for FCM and 1.213 for FKM. The accuracy of the new model is greater than regular Fuzzy Logic by 13.87% for FCM and 18.39% for FKM. It can be concluded that Bee Colony can be used to optimize Fuzzy Logic for pest and disease classifications for paddy with better classification results. © 2016 Praise Worthy Prte S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Bee Colony; Classification; Fuzzy C-Mean; Fuzzy K-Means; Fuzzy Logic",,,,,,,"Agbonifo, O.C., Olufolaji, D.B., A Fuzzy Expert System for Diagnosis and Treatment of Maize Plant Diseases (2012) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science and Software Engineering, 2 (12), pp. 83-89; Kaswidjanti, W., Implementasi Mesin Inferensi Fuzzy (Studi Kasus Sistem Pakar untuk Mendiagnosa Penyakit Tanaman Cabe Merah) (2011) TELEMATIKA, 7 (2), pp. 129-138; Tang, H., Ye, J., Zhou, L., Shi, Z., Agriculture Disease Diagnosis Expert System Based on Knowledge and Fuzzy Reasoning: A Case Study of Flower (2009) Sixth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery, , Tianjin; Fina, F., Birch, P., Young, R., Obu, J., Faithpraise, B., Chatwin, C., Automatic Plant Pest Detection and Recognition Using K-Means Clustering Algorithm and Correspondence Filters (2013) International Journal of Advanced Biotechnology and Research, 4 (2), pp. 189-199; Ghosh, S., Dubey, S.K., Comparative Analysis of K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means Algorithms (2013) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 4 (4), pp. 35-39; Sutantoand Suharjito, K., Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment in Game based on Type of Player with ANFIS Method (2014) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 65 (1), pp. 254-260; Shokouhifar, M., Abkenar, G.S., An Artificial Bee Colony Optimization for MRI Fuzzy Segmentation of Brain Tissue (2011) International Conference on Management and Artificial Intelligence, , Bali; Layona, R., Suharjito, S., Tunardi, Y., Tanoto, D., Optimization of Land Suitability for Food Crops Using Neural Network and Swarm Optimization Algorithm (2016) International Review on Computers and Software (IRECOS), 11 (1), pp. 1-7; Karaboga, D., Basturk, B., A powerful and efficient algorithm for numerical function optimization: Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm (2007) J Glob Optim, 39, pp. 459-471; Karaboga, D., Akay, B., A survey: Algorithms simulating bee swarm intelligence (2009) Artif Intell Rev, 31, pp. 61-85; Krishnamoorthi, M., Natarajan, A.M., Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm Integrated with Fuzzy C-Mean Operator for Data Clustering (2013) Journal of Computer Science, 9 (4), pp. 404-412; Malaki, M., Ahangar, F.S., Zakerolhosseini, A., A Novel Hybrid Fuzzy Clustering Algorithm Based on Artificial Bee colony and C-means (2012) Congress on Electrical, Computer and Information Technology (I.T.)

Inappropriate or unproductive land will impact to productivity decrease, time-consuming, and profit lost. Determining and evaluating the optimal land suitability can be done through prediction of each production area that is obtained by analyzing land fitness data. This study proposes the implementation of Neural Network and Swarm Optimization Algorithm (Particle Swarm Optimization & Cat Swarm Optimization) to obtain prediction of production. To evaluate the proposed method, this study performed comparative evaluation based on the Mean Square Error (MSE) and accuracy. Based on the experimental results, Cat Swarm Optimization produces minimum error equal of 0.00439 for training phase and 0.10453 for testing phase. In training phase, Cat Swarm Optimization produces higher accuracy (93%) than Particle Swarm Optimization (67%). © 2016 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Cat swarm optimization; Land suitability; Neural network; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm optimization algorithm",,,,,,,"Brambilla, I., Porto, G.G., Farm Productivity and Market Structure.

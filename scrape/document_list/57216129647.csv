This research was aimed to evaluate the relationship among the college student’s knowledge, experience, perception, and purchase intension of probiotics among the Jabodetabek (Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, Bekasi) college students. The questionnaire responses from 200 participants with diverse demographic backgrounds were collected. The results showed that the average score on the probiotic knowledge and perception was good. According to chi-square test, there was no correlation among all variables of demographic on probiotic knowledge and experience. Furthermore, only respondent’s experience played a role in their perception of probiotics (p value = 0.00) which was correlated to purchase intention indicated by p value = 0.00. © 2020 The Authors.

The aim of the present study was to test the effect of 4-week functional food ingredient feeding, alone or in combination, on the gut microbiota composition in diabetic rats. Methods: Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were treated for 4 weeks with (1) native taro starch, (2) modified taro-starch, (3) beet juice, (4) psicose, (5) the probiotic L. plantarum IS-10506, (6) native starch combined with beet juice, (7) native starch to which beet juice was adsorbed, (8) modified starch combined with beet juice or (9) modified starch to which beet juice was adsorbed, to modulate the composition of the gut microbiota. This composition was evaluated by sequencing the PCR amplified V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Results: The next-generation sequencing showed beneficial effects particularly of taro-starch feeding. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) related to health (e.g. correlating with low BMI, OTUs producing butyrate) were increased in relative abundance, while OTUs generally correlated with disease (e.g. Proteobacteria) were decreased by feeding taro-starch. Conclusion: The results of study show that a 4-week intervention with functional food ingredients, particularly taro-derived starch, leads to a more healthy gut microbiota in rats that were induced to be diabetic by induction with STZ. © 2020 The Author(s).","Diabetes model; Functional food; Gut microbiota; Obesity; Prebiotic; Taro-starch","food ingredient; probiotic agent; RNA 16S; starch; taro starch; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bacterium; beet juice; body mass; Christensenellaceae; Clostridium; controlled study; high throughput sequencing; Holdemania; intestine flora; Klebsiella; Lactobacillus plantarum; male; nonhuman; Oscillibacter; Peptostreptococcaceae; Phascolarctobacterium; plant juice; polymerase chain reaction; population abundance; Prevotellaceae; rat; Ruminococcaceae; Ruminococcus; Shigella; species composition; Sprague Dawley rat; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus",,"starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9",,,,,"Wild, S., Roglic, G., Green, A., Sicree, R., King, H., Global prevalence of diabetes: Estimates for the year 2000 and projections for 2030 (2004) Diabetes Care, 27 (5), pp. 1047-1053; (2015), https://news.un.org/en/story/2015/07/505352-un-projects-world-population-reach-85-billion-2030-driven-growth-developing, UN-News, Accessed 29 Mar 2020; Lynch, S.V., Pedersen, O., The human intestinal microbiome in health and disease (2016) N Engl J Med, 375 (24), pp. 2369-2379. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2sXhvVSnsQ%3D%3D; Shapiro, H., Suez, J., Elinav, E., Personalized microbiome-based approaches to metabolic syndrome management and prevention (2017) J Diabetes, 9 (3), pp. 226-236; Karlsson, F.H., Tremaroli, V., Nookaew, I., Bergstrom, G., Behre, C.J., Fagerberg, B., Gut metagenome in European women with normal, impaired and diabetic glucose control (2013) Nature, 498 (7452), pp. 99-103. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXotlGls7k%3D; Qin, J., Li, Y., Cai, Z., Li, S., Zhu, J., Zhang, F., A metagenome-wide association study of gut microbiota in type 2 diabetes (2012) Nature, 490 (7418), pp. 55-60. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38XhsVaqt7fJ; Onwueme, I.C., (1978) The Tropical Tuber Crops - Yams, Cassava, Sweet Potato and Cocoyams, , Wiley Chichester; Asha, D.A., Genetic diversity analysis in taro using molecular markers - An overview (2012) J Root Crops, 38 (1), pp. 15-25; Solossa, A.H., Sastrahidayat, I.R., Hakim, L., Home gardens of the local community surrounding Lake Ayamaru, West Papua province, and its consequences for tourism development and lake conservation (2017) J Biodiv Environ Sci, 3 (3), pp. 1-11; Iskandar, J., Iskandar, B.S., Various plants of traditional rituals: Ethnobotanical research among the Baduy community (2017) Biosaintifika J Biol Biol Educ, 9 (1), pp. 114-125; Kreike, C.M., Van Eck, H.J., Lebot, V., Genetic diversity of taro, Colocasia esculenta (L.)

Slow digestion is beneficial for diabetic individuals. To investigate the effects on blood-glucose it is important to be able to predict the amount of digestible starch. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the digestibility of different starches in a validated in-vitro model of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Digestion was performed in the TNO dynamic, computer-controlled in-vitromodel of the upper GI-tract (TIM-1). Release of glucose was measured over time. Products tested were taro-flour, native-, and modified taro-starch. The latter two were also tested with beet-juice adsorbed. These were compared to wheat-flour and a glucose-solution. Modified taro-starch showed a similar glucose-bioaccessibility as wheat-flour (81–83%), while the other products tested had a lower bioaccessibility (60–75%). Adsorption of beet-juice affected digestibility of the modified taro-starch, but not the native-starch. Taro-based products can be used to lower plasma glucose concentrations in diabetic individuals. © 2020 The Author(s).

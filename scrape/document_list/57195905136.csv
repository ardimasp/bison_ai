Qualitative approach was used by conducting face-to-face semi structured interview with internal auditors from Indonesian public companies. This research uses Agency Theory and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as underpinning theories, therefore this research provides academic contribution not only in auditing area but also in information technology. The results indicated that not all participants agreed that GAS is helping them in producing a transparent and accountable financial report. © 2017 IEEE.","Agency theory; GAS; IDX; Internal auditor; TAM","Gallium; Information systems; Agency theory; Face to face; Financial reports; Internal auditor; Public company; Qualitative approach; Semi structured interviews; Technology acceptance model; Metadata",,,,,"Rezaee, Z., (2008) Corporate Governance and Ethics, , Wiley; Braun, R.L., Davis, H.E., Computer-assisted audit tools and techniques: Analysis and perspectives (2003) Managerial Auditing Journal, 18, p. 725; Debreceny, R., Lee, S.-L., Neo, W., Toh, J.S., Employing generalized audit software in the financial services sector: Challenges and opportunities (2005) Managerial Auditing Journal, 20, p. 605; Ismail, N.A., Abidin, A.Z., Perception towards the importance and knowledge of information technology among auditors in Malaysia (2009) Journal of Accounting and Taxation, 1, pp. 061-069; Mahzan, N., Lymer, A., Examining the adoption of computerassisted audit tools and techniques: Cases of generalized audit software use by internal auditors (2014) Managerial Auditing Journal, 29, pp. 327-349; Ahmi, A., Kent, S., The utilisation of generalized audit software (GAS) by external auditors (2013) Managerial Auditing Journal, 28, pp. 88-113; Widuri, R., O'Connell, B., Yapa, P.W.S., Adopting generalized audit software: An Indonesian perspective (2016) Managerial Auditing Journal, 31, pp. 821-847; Kim, H.-J., Mannino, M., Nieschwietz, R.J., Information technology acceptance in the internal audit profession: Impact of technology features and complexity (2009) International Journal of Accounting Information Systems, 10, pp. 214-228; Sikka, P., Financial crisis and the silence of the auditors (2009) Accounting, Organizations and Society, 34, pp. 868-873; Sirois, L.-P., Simunic, D.A., (2010) Auditor Size and Audit Quality Revisited: The Importance of Audit Technology, , September 16, 2011; Janvrin, D., Bierstaker, J., Lowe, D.J., An examination of audit information technology use and perceived importance (2008) Accounting Horizons, 22, pp. 1-21; Manson, S., McCartney, S., Sherer, M., Wallace, W.A., Audit automation in the UK and the us: A comparative study (1998) International Journal of Auditing, 2, pp. 233-246; Dowling, Appropriate audit support system use: The influence of auditor, audit team, and firm factors (2009) The Accounting Review, 84, p. 771; Curtis, M.B., Payne, E.A., An examination of contextual factors and individual characteristics affecting technology implementation decisions in auditing (2008) International Journal of Accounting Information Systems, 9, pp. 104-121; Razi, M.A., Madani, H.H., An analysis of attributes that impact adoption of audit software: An empirical study in Saudi Arabia (2013) International Journal of Accounting and Information Management, 21, pp. 170-188; Blair, M.M., Ownership and control: Rethinking corporate governance for the twenty-first century (2004) Theories of Corporate Governance: The Philosophical Foundations of Corporate Governance, pp. 174-188. , T.

XYZ is a manufacturing company that produces polyethylene plastic. In some periods, the company is not able to meet consumer demand as requests exceed available production capacity. This study aims to determine the work centre that is experiencing a shortage of production capacity and production capacity planning is proposed as an alternative work centre to optimise production capacity at minimal cost using Rough Cut Capacity Planning (RCCP). This type of research is descriptive. Data was collected through interviews and observations and used to perform capacity planning, i.e.The company's policy of data, company resource data, cost data, and historical demand data. Data processing begins with forecasting consumer demand while RCCP is used to determine the work centre that is experiencing a shortage of production capacity. The proposed production capacity is used as an alternative work centre in increasing production capacity. The results from this study, including the estimated plastic demand for the coming 12 months are 434 766 Kg; There are four work centres that are experiencing a shortage of production capacity at the company, which is cutting manual work centre, work centre cutting machines, sealing work centre and work centre printing; fulfilment capacity planning alternative is a recommendation that is considered to be the most optimal.

In everyday life, there is a lot of need to predict something. For example, when you want to determine which items someone wants to buy or estimate the results of football matches or predict the rating of a movie. It's better if we can sell something that is in accordance with the wishes of the customer. Therefore, algorithm predictions are needed that can produce predictions accurately and precisely. In this paper, algorithm predictions are presented with prior data concepts, where data will be divided into 2 parts, training and testing dataset. There are 5 stages in the Priori Prediction (PP) algorithm starting from the data input process, checking the similarity of data, calculating using the difference function, calculating the predictive score, then evaluating using MAE. PP algorithm is also compared with other recommender system algorithms, which are collaborative filtering, cosine similarity, and content-based filtering in experiments and evaluations. The test results show that the proposed algorithm has satisfactory performance compared to other recommender system. © 2019 IEEE.","football score prediction; item rating; prediction algorithm; recommender system","Collaborative filtering; Forecasting; Information management; Sports; Statistical tests; Content based filtering; Cosine similarity; Data input; Difference functions; Prediction algorithms; Priori predictions; Training and testing; Recommender systems",,,,,,"Mirshahvalad, R., Zanjani, N.A., Diabetes prediction using ensemble perceptron algorithm (2017) 2017 9th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks, pp. 190-194; Oana, L., Spataru, A., Use of genetic algorithms in numerical weather prediction (2016) 18th International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing, pp. 456-461; Sespajayadi, A., Indrabayu, Nurtanio, I., Technical data analysis for movement prediction of euro to usd using genetic algorithm-neural network (2015) 2015 International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications, pp. 23-26; Shibu Kumar, K.B., Susheela Devi, V., Rajeev, K.K., Bhatia, A., Probabilistic algorithms for election result prediction (2014) 2014 International Conference on Soft Computing & Machine Intelligence, pp. 79-82; Haojun, Q., Tao, Z., Jichang, G., Task scheduling prediction algorithms for dynamic hardware/software partitioning (2012) 2012 Fifth International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms and Programming, pp. 80-85; Zhou, D., Wu, X., Zhao, W., Lawless, S., Liu, J., Query expansion with enriched user profiles for personalized search utilizing folksonomy data (2017) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 29 (7), pp. 1536-1548; Du, Q., Xie, H., Cai, Y., Leung, H., Li, Q., Min, H., Wang, F.L., Folksonomy-based personalized search by hybrid user profiles on multiple levels (2016) Neurocomputing, 2014, pp. 142-152. , Apr; Xue, D., Wang, Y., Applying cosine similarity to discount evidence (2017) 2017 10th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design (ISCID), 1, pp. 516-519; Sun, B., Dong, L., Dynamic model adaptive to user interest drift based on cluster and nearest neighbors (2017) IEEE Access, 5, pp. 1682-1691; Yang, J., Leskovec, J., Defining and evaluating network communities based on ground-truth (2012) 12th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining; Leskovec, J., Sosic, R., Snap: A general-purpose network analysis and graph-mining library (2016) ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), 8 (1), pp. 1-20; Aarhof, M., (2018) Football Data, , https://datahub.io/collections/football.[Accessed:21-Nov-2018]; Jain, S., Grover, A., Singh Thakur, P., Kumar Choudhary, S., Trends, problems and solutions of recommender system (2015) International Conference on Computing on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA2015)",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","4th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2019","19 August 2019 through 20 August 2019",,152147,,9781728133331,,,"English","Proc.

The service aims to satisfy the patients' requirements, which must be done by one or more qualified staff visiting them within the right time and minimising operational cost. The homecare staff-scheduling problem (HSSP) is an extension of the HHC problem involving planning routes for caregivers visiting n patients. This paper proposes the route scheduling system based on a genetic algorithm approach for solving the HSSP. The focus is to introduce the novel techniques consisting of adaptive-opt (OPT), external k-nearest neighbour swapping (EKN), and internal nearest neighbour search (INN) to incorporate with the GA while also increasing the performance for solving the HSSP. In addition, the trade-off ratio between the percentage of improvement and the execution time is also concerned. The ratio provides the most suitable structure of the proposed GA that can continue to consider other issues for HHC service such as the dynamic scheduling that requires execution speed for recalculating the service plan when some service activities are cancelled immediately. Our empirical study reveals that the proposed techniques can produce improved solutions on two simulated datasets and an adapted case study instance compared to the original GA. © 2019 IEEE.","Genetic algorithm; Homecare service; Local search; Route scheduling; Two-part chromosome","Cloud computing; Economic and social effects; Home health care; Local search (optimization); Nearest neighbor search; Scheduling; Genetic algorithm approach; Home-care services; K-nearest neighbours; Local search; Local search techniques; Nearest neighbour search; Scheduling systems; Two-part chromosomes; Genetic algorithms",,,,,,"Felici, G., Gentile, C., A polyhedral approach for the staff rostering problem (2004) Management Science, 50 (3), pp. 381-393; Bard, J.F., Purnomo, H.W., Preference scheduling for nurses using column generation (2005) European Journal of Operational Research, 164 (2), pp. 510-534. , 7/16/; Topaloglu, S., Selim, H., Nurse scheduling using fuzzy modeling approach (2010) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 161 (11), pp. 1543-1563. , 2010/06/01; Bredström, D., Rönnqvist, M., Combined vehicle routing and scheduling with temporal precedence and synchronization constraints (2008) European Journal of Operational Research, 191 (1), pp. 19-31; Constantino, A.A., Landa-Silva, D., De Melo, E.L., De Mendonça, C.F.X., Rizzato, D.B., Romão, W., A heuristic algorithm based on multi-assignment procedures for nurse scheduling (2014) Annals of Operations Research, 218 (1), pp. 165-183. , 2014//; Redjem, R., Marcon, E., Operations management in the home care services: A heuristic for the caregivers' routing problem (2016) Flexible Services and Manufacturing Journal, 28 (1), pp. 280-303; Cai, X., Li, K.N., A genetic algorithm for scheduling staff of mixed skills under multi-criteria (2000) European Journal of Operational Research, 125 (2), pp. 359-369. , 9/1/; Sinthamrongruk, T., Harnpornchai, N., Determination of optimal number of doctors and appointment interval for an appointment (2015) Information Engineering and Education Science, IRAICS Proceedings, pp. 379-389. , CRC Press; Hadwan, M., Ayob, M., Sabar, N.R., Qu, R., A harmony search algorithm for nurse rostering problems (2013) Information Sciences, 233, pp. 126-140. , 6/1/; Todorovic, N., Petrovic, S., Bee colony optimization algorithm for nurse rostering (2013) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 43 (2), pp. 467-473; Akjiratikarl, C., Yenradee, P., Drake, P.R., PSO-based algorithm for home care worker scheduling in the UK (2007) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 53 (4), pp. 559-583; Gao, S.-C., Lin, C.-W., Particle swarm optimization based nurses' shift scheduling (2013) Proceedings of the Institute of Industrial Engineers Asian Conference 2013, pp. 775-782. , Y.-K.

Task ranking is one of the problems that can be solved by using a machine learning algorithm ranking problem. This work focuses on finding the right approach and corresponding algorithms in the process of ranking to be able to help people in determining which jobs have a higher priority than others. Our approach is to compare several algorithms performed in the process of ranking that are Bipartite Ranking, k-partite Ranking, and Ranking by pairwise comparison. We're used questionnaires and deployment of prototype of Intelligent Personal Assistant Agent to apply the appropriate algorithm in intelligence agent in arranging task priority in daily activity that must be done by the users. After training dataset and evaluate the validation dataset using NDCG, it is found that the collaborative ranking used have a more accurate value / lower variance test evaluation because it uses a large dataset and smaller training dataset. We found that labeling for more than 2 values it is not recommended to use a bipartite ranking if there are many repetitive data, both k-partite ranking and rank by pairwise comparison are able to be used for multi-dimensional data labeling. © 2017 IEEE.","Bipartite Ranking; Intelligence Agent; K-partite Ranking; Ranking by pairwise comparison; Task Ranking","Artificial intelligence; Computer networks; Data handling; Learning systems; Statistical tests; Surveys; Bipartite Ranking; Intelligence agents; K-partite; Ranking by pairwise comparisons; Task Ranking; Learning algorithms",,,,,,"Hang, L.I., A short introduction to learning to rank The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers, Special Section on Information-Based Induction Sciences and Machine Learning, 94 (10). , October 2011; Yorke-Smith, N., Saadati, S., Myers, K.L., Morley, D.N., The design of a proactive personal agent for task management (2012) International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools, 21 (1), p. 1250004; Geng, X., Luo, L., Multilabel ranking with inconsistent rankers 2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3742-3747; Förnkranz, J., Höllermeier, E., Preference learning: An introduction in johannes förnkranz and eyke höllermeier (ed (2010) Preference Learning Springer, pp. 1-17; Cheng, W., Huhn, J., Hullermeier, E., Decision tree and instance-based learning for label ranking (2009) Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 161-168. , Montreal, Canada; Förnkranz, J., Höllermeier, E., Preference learning and ranking by pairwise comparison in johannes förnkranz and eyke höllermeier (2010) Preference Learning Springer, pp. 65-82; Vembu, S., Gärtner, T., Label ranking algorithms: A survey in johannes förnkranz and eyke höllermeier (2010) Preference Learning Springer, pp. 45-64; Raykar, V.C., Yu, S., Eliminating spammers and ranking annotators for crowdsourced labelling tasks (2008) Artificial Intelligence, 172, pp. 1897-1916. , Elsevier; Agarwal, S., Surrogate regret bounds for bipartite ranking via strongly proper losses (2014) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 15, pp. 1653-1674; Agarwal, S., Roth, D., (2005) Learnability of Bipartite Ranking Functions, , P.

Unfortunately the development of interesting and entertaining adaptive multiplayer game based learning for math and science that consider psychological aspects and game balancing for students on mobile platforms that have game balancing is very limited. This paper proposes an integrated model of adaptive Math and Science game based learning for elementary school students with adjustable level of difficulty based on user's ability and additional option for ""Free"" and ""Adventures"" modes. We propose a method where level of difficulty can be adjusted based on previous score, using fuzzy two inputs in the form of percentage correct and the speed of answer to produce output.

They continue to look for ways that can ease their lives and it is up to the explanation of the visualization that closer to the actual visualization and support fast, precise and clear retrieval of interactive information. In order to realize the visualization, augmented reality technology is being used. Augmented reality is a technology that uses camera technology to recognize real world, images, objects, and environments and superimposes virtual information and data onto reality in real time. It combines a virtual object into two or three dimensions in a real three-dimensional environment. By developing an application with augmented reality, it can help user to look more detail into a product and give advantages to company to save the brochure production cost. The development of this application is using client-side and server-side, where the client-side will be run on android smartphone and server-side using a php based web service. The goal of this paper is to develop a 3D catalogue that helps to depict a product in interactive ways with zoom, rotate, choose color, and animation features. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.","3D Model; Android; Augmented Reality; Catalogue; Marker; Smartphone","Augmented reality; Manufacture; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Visualization; Web services; 3-d modeling; Android; Augmented reality technology; Catalogue; Interactive informations; Marker; Three-dimensional environment; Virtual information; Android (operating system)",,,,,,"Augmented Reality Metaio GmbH 2014, , http://www.metaio.com/technology/; Armigniani, J., Furht, B., Anisetti, M., Ceravolo, P., Damiani, E., Ivkovic, M., Augmented Reality Technology, Systems and Application (2010) Springer Science+Business Media, 51, pp. 341-377; (2014) Smartphone OS Market Share, p.

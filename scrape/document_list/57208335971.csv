In this research, sales promotion is the monetary promotion. By using a good sales promotion, the company will know the customer perception of the brand. Previous studies have stated that monetary promotion is a key element in a successful marketing strategy. The management of hypermarkets needs to understand the dynamic of monetary promotion and conceive new ways of organising and executing hypermarket activities that add values to customers. A total of 100 shoppers at a selected hypermarket was used as samples. This study adopted a customer-based approach to address consumer aspects affecting brand awareness, perceived quality, brand association, and brand loyalty. The unit of analysis were Indonesian consumers who are familiar with Antis brand and actively shop at Carrefour’s Puri Hypermarket Jakarta, Indonesia. Data was analysed using Structural Equation Modelling-Partial Least Square (PLS-SEM) method. The results showed intensity of distribution channels had a positive significant influence on perceived quality, brand awareness, brand association, and brand loyalty. Monetary promotion did not have any association between intensity of distribution channel and perceived quality, brand awareness, and brand association. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Brand equity; Intensity of distribution channel; Monetary promotion",,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., (2009) Managing Brand Equity, , New York: The Free Press; Agarwal, S., Teas, R.K., Cross-national applicability of a perceived quality model (2002) Journal of Product and Brand Management, 11 (4), pp. 213-236; Belch, G.E., Belch, M.A., (2004) Advertising and Promotion: An Integrated Marketing Communications Perspective (6 th Ed.), , New York, McGraw-Hill; Buil, I., de Chernatony, L., Martinez, E., Examining the role of advertising and sales promotion on brand equity creation (2013) Journal of Business Research, 66 (1), pp. 115-122; DelVecchio, D., Henard, D.H., Freling, T.H., The effect of sales promotion on post-promotion brand preference: A meta-analysis (2006) Journal of Retailing, 82 (3), pp. 203-213; Erenkol, A.D., Duygun, A., Customers perceived brand equity and a research on the customers of Bellona which is a Turkish furniture brand (2010) The Journal of American Academy of Business, 16 (1), pp. 34-42; Joseph, J., Sivakumaran, B., The moderating effect of loyalty on the relationship of sales promotions and brand equity (2009) AP-Asia-Pacific Advances in Consumer Research, 8; Jørgensen, S., Taboubi, S., Zaccour, G., Retail promotions with negative brand image effects: Is cooperation possible?

This work observes the development of the art of steganographic techniques which focus on computer network devices by visiting articles which published in journals and proceedings. The results obtained that the development of steganography is not only on data which stored on local disk, but also utilizes computer network devices to transmitting the data. Steganography techniques have several modifications in the algorithm to secure data on the network using stegnography that uses socket programming. This results show the evolutions of steganography techniques on network devices for better data security. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Bobade, S., Goudar, R., Secure Data Communication Using Protocol Steganography in IPv6 (2015) IEEE 2015 International Conference on Computing Communication Control and Automaton, p. 275; Seo, J.O., Manoharan, S., Mahanti, A., A Discussion and Review of Network Steganography (2016) 2016 IEEE International Conference in Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, p. 384; Peng, F.X., Jing, S.H., Rong, G.H., A New Network Steganographic Method Based in the Transverse Multi-Protocol Collaboration (2017) Journal of Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing, 8, pp. 445-459; Rahim, R., Simarta, J., Purba, A., Prayogi, M.A., Sapta, A., Sulaiman, O.K., Sembiring, M.A., Suharman, S., Internet based remote desktop using INDY and socket component (2018) Internasional Journal of Engineering & Technology, 7, pp. 44-47; Hassan, E.A., Shareef, H., Islam, M.M., Wahyudie, E., Abdrabou, A.A., Improved Smart Power Socket for Monitoring and Controlling Electrical Home Appliances (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 49292-49305; Hedge, R., Sreenivas, T.H., Steganography in Ad Hoc Network (2015) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technologies, 6, pp. 5405-5408; Kheddar, H., Bouzid, M., Implementation of Steganographic Method Based in IPv4 Identification Field over NS-3 (2015) International Journal of Engineering Research and Applications, 5, pp. 44-48; Venkadesh, P., Dhas, J.P.M., Divya, S.V., Techniques to enhance security in SCTP for multi-homed networks (2015) IEEE: 2015 Global Conference on Communication Technologies (GCCT), p. 468; Gulia, P., Reena, A Novel Technique of Security Improvement in Ad-hoc Network by using FTP (2017) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 12, pp. 6658-6662; Dalal, S., Devi, S., Security Framework against Denial of Service Attacks in Wireless Mesh Network (2017) Global Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics, 13, pp. 829-837; Kadhim, J.M., Abed, A.E., Steganography Using TCP/IP's Sequence Number (2017) Al-Nahrain Journal of Science, 20, pp. 102-108; Reena, Gulia, P., Review of Security in AD-HOC Network Using FTP (2017) Advances in Computational Sciences and Technology, 10, pp. 1417-1426; Shamieh, F., Wang, X., Dynamic Cross-Layer Signaling Exchange for Realtime and on Demand Multimedia Streams (2018) IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 17, pp. 1-12; Ruban, I., Chuiko, N.L., Mukhin, V., Kornaga, Y., Grishko, I., Smirnov, A., The Method of Hidden Terminal Transmission of Network Attack Signatures (2018) International Journal Computer Network and Information Security, 10 (4), pp. 1-9; Troegeler, B., Watters, P., Steganographic Transports: A Vector for Hidden Secret Internets?

These works are implemented at the computers network layers. The stegblock will convert the transactions data which sent among network into other data's form, it means the data such as ID Number, Account Number, Passwords and others are converted with other data called cover. Finally, the system sends the cover without the real data, it just represented data and able to read by the receiver. The result shows that this design provides data security, undetectability, and integrity for payment transactions using networks. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Amar, C., Sultanhusen, S., Vashista, G.D.S.V., Raza, N., A Review - Transaction Security Using Steganography and Visual Cryptography (2017) International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology, pp. 597-600; Priya, H.M., Lalithamani, N., A Survey for Securing Online Payment Transaction Using Biometrics Authentication (2017) Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 517, pp. 81-91; Seo, J.O., Manoharan, S., Mahanti, A., A Discussion and Review of Network Steganography (2016) 2016 IEEE 14th Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, p. 384; Kheddar, H., Bouzid, M., Implementation of Steganographic Method Based in IPv4 Identification Field over NS-3 (2015) International Journal of Engineering Research and Applications, 5, pp. 44-48; Dalal, S., Devi, S., Security Framework against Denial of Service Attacks in Wireless Mesh Network (2017) Global Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics, 13, pp. 829-837; Bobade, D., Goudar, R., Secure Data Communication Using Protocol Steganography in IPv6 (2015) IEEE 2015 International Conference on Computing Communication Control and Automaton, p. 275; Gulia, P., Reena, A Novel Technique of Security Improvement in Ad-hoc Network by using FTP (2017) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 12, pp. 6658-6662; Venkadesh, P., Dhas, J.P.M., Divya, S.V., Techniques to enhance security in SCTP for multi-homed networks (2015) IEEE: 2015 Global Conference on Communication Technologies (GCCT), p. 468; Ruban, I., Chuiko, N.L., Mukhin, V., Kornaga, Y., Grishko, I., Smirnov, A., The Method of Hidden Terminal Transmission of Network Attack Signatures (2018) International Journal Computer Network and Information Security, 10 (4), pp. 1-9; Peng, F.X., Jing, S.H., Rong, G.H., A New Network Steganographic Method Based in the Transverse Multi-Protocol Collaboration (2017) Journal of Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing, 8, pp. 445-459; Brindha, T., Shaji, R.S., A Secure Transaction of Cloud Data using Conditional Source Trust Attributes Encryption Mechanism (2016) Soft Computing, pp. 1013-1022; Devi, M.D.A., Kumar, K.B.S., A Novel Image Steganography Technique for Secured Online Transaction Using DWT and Visual Cryptography (2017) IOP Conf.

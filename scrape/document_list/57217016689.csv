The recent economic crisis is known to have had a great impact on consumer behavior with regard to restaurants. Therefore, this study is primarily focused on exploring the effects on the traditional antecedents of satisfaction and revisit intentions as full-time restaurants attempt to come up with better marketing strategies. This study involved 150 respondents who recently visited a full-service restaurant within the period of one month prior to the data collection. A confirmatory factor analysis and a reliability analysis were used to test the reliability and validity of the measurements. The hypotheses testing was conducted using a simple and multiple linear regression analysis to test the suitability of the proposed model for measuring satisfaction and revisit intentions. The results of the study showed that atmosphere has a significant influence on customer satisfaction and revisit intention. Customer satisfaction was also found as one of the most significant factors impacting revisit intention in the full-service restaurant industry. Therefore, restaurant managers can use a combination of good price and exciting atmosphere to enhance satisfaction and revisit intention. This study provides insights on full-service restaurants in Indonesia which have not received much attention in both marketing and hospitality literature. © 2020, IGI Global.","Customer Satisfaction; Full-Service Restaurant; Revisit Intention; Service Marketing; Service Quality",,,,,,"Al-Tit, A.A., The effect of service and food quality on customer satisfaction and hence customer retention (2015) Asian Social Science, 11 (23), pp. 129-139; Baker, J., Grewal, D., Parasuraman, A., The influence of store environment on quality inferences and store image (1994) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 22 (4), pp. 328-339; Barrows, C., Food and beverage management (2008) The SAGE Handbook of Hospitality Management, , Sage; Bei, L.T., Chiao, Y.C., An integrated model for the effects of perceived product, perceived service quality, and perceived price fairness on consumer satisfaction and loyalty (2001) Journal of Consumer Satisfaction, Dissatisfaction & Complaining Behavior, 14, pp. 125-140; Bojanic, D.C., Consumer perceptions on price, value and satisfaction in the hotel industry: An exploratory study (1996) Journal of Hospitality & Leisure Marketing, 4 (1), pp. 5-22; Bowen, D.E., Schneider, B., Boundary-spanning-role employees and the service encounter: Some guidelines for management and research (1985) The Service Encounter, pp. 127-147. , In J.A.

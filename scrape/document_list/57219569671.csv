However, there are less understandings on factors influencing the uses. Looking at existing literature, the uses of social media within a government are focused on transparency, openness, collaboration, and citizen participation. Hence, this study aims at investigating factors influencing the uses. Four theories being considered intentionally follow prior researches (i.e., transparency, openness, participation, and collaboration). Particularly, this study attempts to examine factors influencing people behavior within a government in using social media to accomplish their activities in various aspects, including politics, economics, social, culture, defense, and security. Besides, the uses are observed in several governmental tasks such as dealing with complaints, reports and documentation, critics and suggestions, and information dissemination to citizens. Therefore, this study will deliver a new understanding to the government on factors influencing their uses of social media, including how they might use social media accordingly to the needs of their citizens. © 2020 IEEE.","Citizen interaction; Collaboration; Government; Information; Openness; Participation; Social media; Transparency","Behavioral research; Economics; Information dissemination; Information management; Transparency; Citizen participation; People behavior; Social media; Systematic literature review; Social networking (online)",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

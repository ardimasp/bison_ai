One of their strategies is through digital marketing approaches. However, VGM decides to reinstate its photography ban at roughly the same time the 'selfie' trend is booming all over the world, which might hinder the museum's mission. This case study explores issues in a museum business that slightly differ, yet still holds high relevance to any regular business in terms of digital communication strategy. The aims of this case study are to exercise a decision-making process in which the visitors and the non-visitors of the VGM play a major role, and to initiate creativity in discovering ways to communicate and creating relationship with the public or targeted audience. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Co.",,,,,,,"Hein, A., Amsterdam: 18+ Million Visitors (2016) Dutch Amsterdam, , http://www.dutchamsterdam.nl/4456-amsterdam-europe-eight-most-popular-citydestination, 2 February, accessed on July 1 2017; Pieters, J., Record Year for Amsterdam Museum Attendance, , http://nltimes.nl/2014/11/24/record-year-amsterdam-museum-attendanceace, 24 November 2014, NL Times, ssed on July 1 2017; (2014) Beeldende Kunst Favorite Onder de Musea: Infographic, , http://www.cultuurmarketing.nl/beeldende-kunst-favoriet-onder-de-museainfographic/#WV3p3cqlbqA, EM-Cultuur. 10 August 2014, accessed on July 4 2017; Pieters, J., (2014) Record Year for Amsterdam Museum Attendance, , http://nltimes.nl/2014/11/24/record-year-amsterdam-museum-attendance, 24 November, accessed on July 1 2017; Pieters, J., Record Year for Amsterdam Museum Attendance (2014) NL Times, , http://nltimes.nl/2014/11/24/record-year-amsterdam-museum-attendance, 24 November, accessed on July 1 2017; Encyclopaedia Britannica Van Gogh Museum, , http://www.britannica.com/topic/Van-Gogh-Museum, accessed on June 17 2017; (2014) VGM, p. 10. , http://vangoghmuseum-assetserver.appspot.com/serveid=5786521927942144&filename=VGM-Strategisch-Plan-2014-2017-ENG, Strategic Plan 2014-2017, accessed on June 17 2017; (2014) Strategic Plan 2014-2017, , http:://vangoghmuseum-assetserver.appspot.com/serveid=5786521927942144&filename=VGM-Strategisch-Plan-2014-2017-ENG, VGM, accessed on June 17 2017; National Gallery of Art.

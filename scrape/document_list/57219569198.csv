This attack will take the user to a webpage that has been specifically designed to retrieve user sessions and cookies. Nearly 68% of websites are vulnerable to XSS attacks. In this study, the authors conducted a study by evaluating several machine learning methods, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Naïve Bayes (NB). The machine learning algorithm is then equipped with the n-gram method to each script feature to improve the detection performance of XSS attacks. The simulation results show that the SVM and n-gram method achieves the highest accuracy with 98%. © 2020 IEEE.","Detection script; Machine learning; Malicious script; N-gram; Vulnerable; XSS attack","Information management; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Support vector machines; Websites; Cross-site scripting; Detection performance; K nearest neighbours (k-NN); Machine learning methods; N-gram methods; User sessions; Xss attacks; Learning algorithms",,,,,"Bina Nusantara University supports the publication of this research.","Veerasamy, B.D., Creating a model http server program with Java (2010) Int.

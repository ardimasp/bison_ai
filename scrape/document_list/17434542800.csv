Bricks that available in some regions have poor quality, low compressive strength, higher water absorption and uneven surfaces Therefore in this study, rice husk ash has been utilized for the preparation of bricks in partial replacement of clay. The specimens were cast with different replacement levels of clay varying as 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% with rice husk ash. The specimens were tested for water absorption and compressive strength accordingly to Malaysian Standard EN 1008:2010 for 2 hours. Experimental shows that excessive addition of rice husk ash has higher water absorption and low compressive strength as rice husk ash percentage increases rice husk ash characteristics predominate. The bonding between the clay particle and the rice husk ash particles is weak. By adding 10% of rice husk ash by weight is the best brick properties which 6.80 MPa of compressive strength and 16.30% of water absorption. The water absorption of RHA brick developed did not exceed 20% hence promoted to be partial replacement of clay. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","brick; clay; Rice husk ash (RHA)","Brick; Compressive strength; Joint prostheses; Sports; Brick properties; Clay particles; Ecological damage; Low compressive strengths; Partial replacement; Replacement level; Rice husk ash; Uneven surfaces; Water absorption",,,,,,"Papademetriou, M.K., Dent, F.J., Herath, E.M., (2000) Bridging the Rice Yield Gap in the Asia-Pacific Region, p. 215; Tonnayopas, D., Tekasakul, P., Jaritgnam, S., Effects of Rice Husk Ash on Characteristics of Lightweight Clay Brick (2008) Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Development Conference, pp. 36-39; (2002) United Nations Development Programme-Annual Report; (2011) Annual Report Bank Negara Malaysia; Gonçalves, M.R.F., Bergmann, C.P., Thermal insulators made with rice husk ashes: Production and correlation between properties and microstructure (2007) Journal of Construction and Building Materials, 21 (12), pp. 2059-2065; Werther, J., Saenger, M., Hartge, E.U., Ogada, T., Siagi, Z., Combustion of agricultural residues (2000) Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, 26 (1), pp. 1-27; Oliveira Geiza, E., Jose Nilson, H., Use of mix of clay/solid waste from steel works for civil construction materials (2004) Journal of Waste Management, 22, pp. 358-363; Prasad, H.R., Prasad, H.V., An Approach for Alternative Solution in Brick Manufacturing (2014) International Journal of Science, Envrinment, 3, pp. 1105-1114; Shakir, A.A., Mohammed, A.A., Manufacturing of Bricks in the Past, in the Present and in the Future: A state of the Art Review (2013) International Journal of Advances in Applied Sciences (IJAAS), 2, pp. 145-156; Hossain, T., Sarker, S.K., Basak, B.C., Utilization potential of rice husk ash as a construction material in rural areas (2011) Journal of Civil Engineering, 39, pp. 175-188; Saranya, K., Santhoshkumar, M., Sathish, S., Gopinath, S., Parimelashwaran, P., Recycling of Bagasse Ash and Rice Husk Ash in the production of Bricks (2016) International Journal of Emerging Technology in Computer Science & Electronics, 21, pp. 61-67; Ikpong, A.A., Okpala, D.C., Strength characteristics of medium workability ordinary Portland cement-rice husk ash concret (1992) Building and Environment, 27 (1), pp. 105-111; Bui, D.D., Hu, J., Stroevven, P., Particle size effect on the stregth of rice husk ash blended gap graded Portland cement concrete (2005) Cement Coner Compos, 27 (3), pp. 357-366; Saraswathy, V., Song, H., Corrosion performance of rice husk ash blended concrete (2007) Construction and Building Materials, 21 (8), pp. 1779-1784; Al-Khalaf, M.N., Yousift, H.A., Use of rice husk ash in concrete (1984) The International Journal of Cement Composites and Lightweight Concrete, 6 (4), pp. 241-248; Standard Specification for Coal Fly Ash and Raw or Calcined Natural Pozzolan for Use (2010) Annual Book of ASTM Standards, pp. 3-6. , ASTM; (2010) Testing and Assessing the Suitablity of Water, Including Water Recovered from Process in the Concrete Industry, , Mixing Water for Brick-Specification for Sampling Malaysia Standard, MS EN 1008; Standard Test Method for Sampling and Testing Brick and Structural Clay Tile, , ASTM C67/C67M-18; De Silva, G.H.M.J.S., Perera, B.V.A., Effect of Rice Husk Ash (RHA) on Structural Properties of Fired Clay Bricks (2018) Journal of Building Engineering, 18, pp. 252-259; Fernando, P.R., Mechanical and Physical Properties of Fired Clay Brick Partial Doped with Coconut Shell Ash (2017) Journal of Energy and Natural Resources, 6 (5), pp. 58-63; Tonnayopas, D., Tekasakul, P., Jaritgnam, S., Effects of Rice Husk Ash on Characteristics of Lightweight Clay Brick (2008) Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Development Conference, (January), pp. 36-39; Nawy Edward, G., (2009) Reinforced Concrete (A Fundamental Approach)",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","2nd Joint International Conference on Emerging Computing Technology and Sports, JICETS 2019","25 November 2019 through 27 November 2019",,161273,17426588,,,,"English","J.

The plan is to make the driveline operates on the hydro-pneumatic hybrid passenger car. The greatest challenge in developing a hydro-pneumatic hybrid passenger car is how to provide enough and optimum provision storage systems. Energy capacity affects the performance of a hybrid driveline, and it can be increased by increasing the size of the energy storage. However, the passenger car space is minimal. Therefore, one of the solutions is to use smaller storage, but more in numbers. Its small size allows it to be placed in several suitable locations in the car while the number increases the storage capacity. An experiment was carried out to see the multiple storage system behaviours to operate at the low-pressure level. Through the experiment, it was found that the multiple storages produced better power and discharged time compared to single storage. However, the torque and efficiency had an adverse effect because of the increase in motor speed and flow disturbance. The lowest efficiency recorded by the experiment was 40%, and the highest was 55%. In conclusion, the multiple storage systems are possible to be adapted to the hybrid hydro-pneumatic passenger car. However, some tweaks on component efficiency and lightweight material need to be considered. © 2020, Universiti Malaysia Perlis.

To overcome this matter, the removal of dyes are needed by using activated carbon. The precursors of activated carbon can be prepared by various organic materials with high level of carbon content. Pinang frond was being selected for precursor of activated carbon in this study, and named as PFAC. This PFAC was used to adsorb methylene blue (MB) as a media for removal of MB. The aim of this study is to determine the optimum operating parameters such as CO2 flow rate (mL/min), activation time (hour) and activation temperature (°C)for the better removal of MB by using response surface methodology (RSM) as an experimental design (DoE). The 476 mL/min CO2 flow rate, 6.0 hour activation time, and 867°C activation temperature were become the optimum operating parameters of PFAC in this study.The model developed by RSM shows that less than 2.5% error in comparison with the experimental data, hence it can be used for prediction of the fixed responses of operating parameters. The pseudo-first-order model was matched with the MB adsorption kinetic. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Activated carbon; an experimental design; methylene blue","Aromatic compounds;

At Bina Nusantara University there are organic and nonorganic trash bins, but the function is still not optimal due to the unfavorable interest of Binusian to use it or to carry out recycling activities. The survey was conducted using a questionnaire to 114 Binusian respondents qualitatively to get responses from 14 attributes related to recycling care and the design of the trash. The response from these 14 attributes will be the customer voice that is processed using Quality Function Deployment (QFD) to determine technical priorities that can be used to meet customer requirements. From the planning matrix, the factors that must be improved are the availability of organic and nonorganic waste bins, as well as improvements to the design of existing trash bins at Bina Nusantara University.

In this study, deposit layer of diesel fuel (DF) and 5% palm oil based bio-diesel fuel blends (B5) were prepared for surface temperature at 250°C and 357°C by using a hollow cylinder heater. Then, the hollow cylinder covered with deposit layer in its inner surface was inserted in a heat transfer chamber apparatus to investigate its effect on heat transfer to surrounding. Deposit layer for DF that was prepared at surface temperature of 357°C was able to act as insulator which prevents the heat from transferring to the surrounding compared to deposit layer formed at lower surface temperature.

With high level of carbon content, various organic materials have been chosen as based materials for activated carbon. In this study, activated carbon from pinang frond (PFAC) was created by using a physical activation and optimized the operating parameters such as activation temperature (°C), activation time (hour) and, CO2 flow rate (mL/min). Experimental design (DoE) for PFAC preparation was developed and optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). It was found that the optimum PFAC preparation conditions was at the activation temperature of 867°C, activation time of 6.0 hour and CO2 flow rate of 476 mL/min. By verification with experimental values, the predicted values from the model was only less than 2% of errors for RBBR removal onto PFAC. This can be pointed out that the model is sufficient and suitable to predict the operating parameters fixed responses. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

This paper proposes a prediction model on the performance of a naturally aspirated spark ignition engine equipped with a waste heat recovery mechanism (WHRM) using steam turbine mechanism. The simulation method is created using an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the power produced from this WHRM. The automated neural network was employed to run the simulation, where the ANN analysis used multilayer perceptrons as the network architecture, which is a feed-forward neural network architecture with uni-directional full connections between successive layers and applied Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm iterative techniques to train the data. By using ANN, power generated from this WHRM could be predicted with good accuracy of 0.007, 0.011, and 0.016% error on training, test and validation data, respectively. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Artificial neural network; Exhaust gas; Organic rankine cycle; Waste heat recovery","Computer system recovery; Exhaust gases; Forecasting; Iterative methods; Neural networks; Rankine cycle; Steam turbines; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Broyden; Combined heating and power; Iterative technique; Naturally aspirated; Organic Rankine cycles; Prediction model; Validation data; Network architecture",,,,"Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka, UTeM

This includes the utilization of waste energy into 'useful energy'. For a vehicle using internal combustion engine (ICE), the waste energy produce by exhaust gas can be utilize to 'useful energy' up to 34%. The energy from the automotive exhaust can be harness by implementing heat pipe heat exchanger in the automotive system. In order to maximize the amount of waste energy that can be turned to 'useful energy', the used of appropriate fluid in the heat exchanger is important. In this study, the fluid used is water, thus converting the fluid into steam and thus drive the turbine that coupling with generator. The paper will explore the performance of a naturally aspirated spark ignition (S.I.) engine equipped with waste heat recovery mechanism (WHRM) that used water as the heat absorption medium. The experimental and simulation test suggest that the concept is thermodynamically feasible and could significantly enhance the system performance depending on the load applied to the engine. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",,"Automobile engines; Energy efficiency; Engines; Gases; Global warming; Heat exchangers; Heat pipes; Internal combustion engines; Solid wastes; Steam turbines; Vehicles; Waste heat; Waste incineration; Water absorption; Automotive exhaust; Automotive Systems; Heat absorption; Heat pipe heat exchangers; Naturally aspirated; Renewable energies; Simulation tests; Spark ignition; Waste heat utilization",,,,,,"Chammas, R.E., Clodic, D., (2005) Combine Cycle for Hybrid Vehicle, SAE Paper 2005, 1, p. 1171; Peng, Z., Wang, T., He, Y., Yang, X., Lu, L., Analysis of environmental and economic benefits of integrated Exhaust Energy Recovery (EER) for vehicles (2013) Applied Energy, 105, pp. 238-243; Boretti, A.A., Transient operation of internal combustion engines with Rankine waste heat recovery systems (2012) Applied Thermal Engineering, 36, pp. 18-23; Serrano, J., Dolz, V., Novella, R., Garcia, A., DH diesel engine equipped with a bottoming Rankine cycle as waste heat recovery system Part 2: Evaluation of alternative solution (2012) Applied Thermal Engineering, 36, pp. 279-287; Yang, F., Gao, G., Ouyang, M., Chen, L., Yang, Y., Research on a diesel HCCI engine assisted by an ISG motor (2013) Applied Energy, 101, pp. 718-779; Zhao, R., Zhuge, W., Zhang, Y., Yin, Y., Chen, Z., Li, Z., Parametric study of power turbine for diesel engine waste heat recovery (2014) Applied Thermal Engineering, 67 (1), pp. 308-319; Wang, T., Zhang, Y., Zhang, J., Shu, G., Peng, Z., Analysis of recoverable exhaust energy from a light-duty gasoline engine (2013) Applied Thermal Energy, 53 (2), pp. 414-419; Yang, F., Yuan, X., Lin, G., Waste heat recovery using heat pipe heat exchanger for heating automobile using exhaust gas (2003) Applied Thermal Energy, 23 (3), pp. 367-372; Kauranen, P., Elonen, T., Wikstrom, L., Heikkinen, K., Laurikko, J., Temperature optimisation of a diesel engine using exhaust gas heat recovery and thermal energy storage (diesel engine with thermal energy storage) (2010) Applied Thermal Energy, 30 (6), pp. 631-638; Will, F., Fuel conservation and emission reduction through novel waste heat recovery for internal combustion engines (2012) Fuel, 102, pp. 247-255; Herawan, S.G., Rohhaizan, A.H., Putra, A., Ismail, A.F., Prediction of Waste Heat Energy Recovery Performance in a Naturally Aspirated Engines Using Artificial Neural Network (2014) ISRN Mechanical Engineering; Bumby, J., Spooner, E., Carter, J., (2016) Electrically Assisted Turbochargers; Their Potential for Energy Recovery; (2009) T.

They can be produced from various organic materials which have a high level of carbon content. In this study, Pinang frond based activated carbon (PFAC) was produced by using a physical activation process to study the effect of different activation times in the range of 1-7 hours. The optimum PFAC sample was found with an activation time of 3 hours, which gives the highest BET surface area and pore volume of 958.23 m2/g and 0.5469 mL/g, respectively. This sample shows well-developed pore structure with a high fixed carbon content of 79.74%. The removal of 87.6% of Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) was achieved for a sample with initial RBBR concentration of 50 mg/L, and 40.8% was achieved with 500 mg/L. The results indicated that the PFAC is very effective for RBBR adsorption from aqueous solution. © Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Malaysia.","Activated carbon; Activation time; Pinang frond; Remazol Brilliant Blue R",,,,,,,"Dias, J.M., Alvim-Ferraz, M., Almeida, M.F., Rivera-Utrilla, J., Sánchez-Polo, M., Waste materials for activated carbon preparation and its use in aqueous-phase treatment: A review (2007) Journal of Environmental Management, 85, pp. 833-846;

They can be produced from various organics materials having high level of carbon content. In this study, a novel Pinang frond activated carbon (PFAC) was produced at various COflow rates in the range of 150-600 mL/min at activation temperature of 800°C for 3 hours. The optimum PFAC sample is found on COflow rate of 300 mL/min which gives the highest BET surface area and pore volume of 958 m2/g and 0.5469 mL/g, respectively. This sample shows well-developed pore structure with high fixed carbon content of 79.74%. The removal of methylene blue (MB) by 95.8% for initial MB concentration of 50 mg/L and 72.6% for 500 mg/L is achieved via this sample. The PFAC is thus identified to be a suitable adsorbent for removing MB from aqueous solution. © 2013 S. G.

The objective of this paper is to characterize oil-palm shells, as a biomass byproduct from palm-oil mills which were converted into activated carbons by nitrogen pyrolysis followed by CO2 activation. The effects of no holding peak pyrolysis temperature on the physical characteristics of the activated carbons are studied. The BET surface area of the activated carbon is investigated using N2 adsorption at 77 K with selected temperatures of 500, 600, and 700°C. These pyrolysis conditions for preparing the activated carbons are found to yield higher BET surface area at a pyrolysis temperature of 700°C compared to selected commercial activated carbon. The activated carbons thus result in well-developed porosities and predominantly microporosities. By using this activation method, significant improvement can be obtained in the surface characteristics of the activated carbons. Thus this study shows that the preparation time can be shortened while better results of activated carbon can be produced. © 2013 S. G.

The ever increasing fuel price and its cost of transportation to the remote location limited the availability of electricity to certain time of the day. Since the rural settlement usually located near water source, renewable energy based on hydro is suggested. This paper will discuss about the development of model system for cost-effective pico-hydro turbine. The size of the turbine will be based on low flow and low head application. Two types of turbine, propeller or also known as axial-flow and cross-flow, are evaluated under these conditions. Both of the turbines were installed in one model system equipped with storage tanks and piping system. Centrifugal pump is used to ensure the circulation of the water between main storage tank into the flowing tank simulating the run-of river application for pico hydro system. The head of the model system is fixed with variable parameter of water flow rate is controlled by using controller valve and flow meter for power data collection for each turbine. The performance of both turbines were also simulated and evaluated by using CFD's software. Techno-economics evaluations are done so that the model of the system will be able to select the optimum size of the turbine based on the flow rate for a cheap efficient and cost-effective hydro turbine. © 2011 IEEE.","Cost effective; Cross-flow; Model system; Pico hydro turbine; Propeller","Alternative energy; Cost effective; Cost of transportation; Cross flows; Fuel prices; Hydro-system; Hydroturbines; Low flow; Low head; Model system; Power data; Remote location; Renewable energies; Rural electrification; Rural settlement; Storage tank; Techno-economics; Variable parameters; Water flow rate; Water source; Centrifugal pumps; Cost effectiveness; Electric utilities; Energy conservation; Flow rate; Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulic turbines; Propellers; Pumps; Rural areas; Sustainable development; Tanks (containers); Costs",,,,,,"Zahnd, A., Kimber, H.M., Benefits from a renewable energy village electrification system (2009) Renewable Energy, 34, pp. 362-368; William, A.A., Simpson, R., Pico-hydro - Reducing technical risks for rural electrification (2009) Renewable Energy, 34, pp. 1986-1991; Baines, J., William, A.A., A test rig for pico hydro pelton turbines (1997) Pico Hydro, (1). , UK: Nottingham Trent University; Oct; Zainuddin, H., Yahaya, M.S., Lazi, J.M., Basar, M.F.M., Ibrahim, Z., Design and development of pico-hydro generation system for energy storage using consuming water distributed to houses Proceeding of World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, pp. 154-159; Sopian, K., Razak, J.A., Pico hydro: Clean power from small streams (2009) Proceedings of the 3rd WSEAS Int.

The properties of those glasses seem to depend on the field strength of the alkali or alkali-earth ions in glasses as in silicate glasses. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy indicates that the glass network is dominated by bridging P-tetrahedral present in glasses with O/P ≈ 3.0. The variation in physical properties of the glasses seem to be closely related to the variation in structure of the glasses and could be explained by simple mechanism such as field strength and differences in mass. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.","Alkali; Alkaline-earth; Density; Glass transition; IR spectroscopy; Molar volume; Phosphate glasses",,,,,,,"Campbell, J.H., Suratwala, T.I., (2001) J Non-Cryst.

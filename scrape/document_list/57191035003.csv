The data was obtained using a survey via Google Forms in June 2018 and April–July 2020 in Indonesia. The analysis techniques were confirmatory factor analyses/CFA using LISREL and test of differences using JASP. The data could be used by the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Informatics (KEMENKOMINFO), Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture (KEMENDIKBUD), Indonesian Ministry of Youth and Sports (KEMENPORA), as well as social marketers to map the three constructs in Indonesian youth and to prevent the adverse effects and impacts of celebrity worship, digital illiteracy, and inappropriate mode of nostalgia. © 2020 The Author(s)","Celebrity; Construct validity; Digital literacy; Factor analysis; Indonesia; Nostalgic emotion; Psychology",,,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

This study aims at investigating the predictors of vulnerability to phishing and tailgating from the psychological perspective. The study was conducted on a sample of Indonesians (125 males, 137 females; Mage = 28 years old, SDage = 8.319 years); considered as the 'millennial' age group. Multiple linear regression analyses covering seven predictors of the vulnerabilities, i.e. insufficient knowledge/media literacy, excitement of victory, fear of authority, desire to be helpful, fear of loss, laziness, and appeal to ego, showed that the psychological models predicting vulnerability of experiencing phishing and tailgating were confirmed, with an effect size range between 18.5% to 19%. Media literacy alone was proven to be inadequate in managing/deterring the variables that embrace vulnerability to the two social engineering techniques. The relevance of this study to lifelong learning gravity is discussed throughout this article. © 2020 Birlesik Dunya Yenilik Arastirma ve Yayincilik Merkezi.

To give a theoretical basis for the efforts of preventing corruption that is thick with emotional nuance, this present study employs disruption to psychological contract, i.e. psychological contract breach (PCB), as a predictor of moral emotions proneness. The study involving 265 employees (169 males, 96 females; Mage = 32.32 years old; SDage = 7.28 years) of four big private banks in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, shows that PCB—with noting that, in this study, its scale operational scoring represents, reversely, the contract fulfillment—can predict Guilt-negative behavior evaluation (Guilt-NBE), Guilt-repair (Guilt-REP), and Shame-negative self-evaluation (Shame-NSE); all in negative directions, proved via simple linear regression analyses. Further analysis showed a more dynamic relationship between PCB and Guilt-NBE that fits to a cubic regression model. This study contributes to the axiological aspect of business psychology, especially in the ethical psychology of banking industry. © 2020 The Author(s)","Business psychology; Corruption; Guilt and shame; Moral emotion; Organizational psychology; Psychological contract; Psychology",,,,,"Binus University: 026/VR

Recent studies of automatically assigning a personal profile to the users of social media have emerged within the last decade as using personality measuring instruments was considered impractical in the online context. Though being a part of a massive amount of activities in social media, only a few studies have reviewed the approach of automatically recognizing the Bahasa Indonesia speaking users. Previous studies indicated that dataset remains a serious limitation in the field of study, where obtaining a large amount of labelled data is expensive and time-consuming. With that in mind, we present a practical and effective approach to utilize the abundance of unlabeled data in a semi-supervised learning setting using the label propagation model. With the highest ROC AUC score of 0.93 as achieved by the Super Learner algorithm, the presented method could be considered as a sensible approach as a means of overcoming the dataset limitation. © 2019 ISSN.","Automatic personality recognition; Bahasa Indonesia; Semi-supervised learning; Super learner; The big five personality model",,,,,,,,,"Farnadi, G., Sitaraman, G., Sushmita, S., Celli, F., Kosinski, M., Stillwell, D., Davalos, S., Cock, M.

The most popular internet application in this country is social media. During the election in Jakarta, the phenomenon shows that many social media users do hatred in their posting. This situation gives a clue about the emotional factors related to Problematic Internet Use (PIU). According to PIU concept, people with PIU syndrome have maladaptive cognition and also maladaptive behavior. The hatred posting was part of maladaptive behavior. The objective of this study was to give empirical evidence the impact of three emotional factors, such as emotion reactivity, emotion regulation, and empathy, to PIU. Sample of this research were 274 undergraduate students from 2 universities in Jakarta. They were given 4 instruments self-report: GPIUS2, ERS, ERQ, and IRI. Results showed that the multiple regression of three emotional factors was significant to PIU. But only emotion reactivity gave the contribution in this study. It indicates that the emotion reactivity has role to PIU and it also explain about the hatred posting on social media. © 2017 IEEE.","Emotion reactivity; Emotion regulation; Empathy; Problematic Internet Use (PIU); Social media","Students; Emotion regulations; Empathy; Internet application; Maladaptive behavior; Multiple regressions; Problematic Internet use; Social media; Undergraduate students; Social networking (online)",,,,,"This research and publication was conducted with research grant from Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of Republic of Indonesia.

This opportunity is due to the abundant amount of information shared by the user. This fact is especially true for countries with high number of active social media users such as Indonesia. Extraction of information from social media can yield insightful results if done correctly. Recent studies have managed to leverage associations between language and personality and build a personality prediction system based on those associations. The current study attempts to build a personality prediction system based on a Twitter user's information for Bahasa Indonesia, the native language of Indonesia. The personality prediction system is built on Support Vector Machine and XGBoost trained with 329 instances (users). Evaluation results using 10-fold cross validation shows that the system managed to reach highest average accuracy of 76.2310% with Support Vector Machine and 97.9962% with XGBoost. © 2017 PTI.",,"Forecasting; Information systems; Support vector machines; 10-fold cross-validation; Amount of information; Automated analysis; Evaluation results; Extraction of information; Native language; Personality predictions; Status updates; Social networking (online)",,,,"Kementerian Riset, Teknologi dan Pendidikan Tinggi

For that, researcher in this country needed validated instruments in local language. This paper presents the correlation between PIU and the two typology types of loneliness with the instruments in Indonesian version. Sample of this study was 316 undergraduate students related to social networking sites. The activity was the biggest activity on the Internet in Indonesia. PIU was measured by GPIUS2 (Generalized Problematic Internet Use Scale 2). The two typology types of loneliness were measured by SELSA (Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults). This research indicated that PIU has a significant correlation with only emotional loneliness, while social loneliness didn’t correlate to PIU. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

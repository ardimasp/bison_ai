Tourists are the main source of income for gross domestic income in Indonesia. However, although Indonesia as a beautiful archipelago country has so much offer to foreign and local tourist, until now it fails to give their potential to the country. Furthermore, the COVID-19 situation made Indonesia tourism worse. Travelling is banned as a consequence of lockdown in Indonesia. Business and economic need to adjust into their new normal. Unfortunately, in the midst of the current era of Internet technology and new normal, Indonesia’s tourism promotion is considered to be uneven and unwell targeted. Many tourist destinations are very interesting and clean but not yet known by potential tourists both from domestic and abroad due to the lack of targeted promotions and re-branding of a safe place to visit. Seeing to this prob-lem, this study aims to propose an integrated tourism system called SONIA, by using a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to build a personalized recommender system. Through this system integration model, a significant socio-economic benefit can be made for tourism sector in Indonesia. The results of the research will be exploited for the tourism industry and Indonesia’s participation in the global tourism competition market. © 2020, ICIC International.

The implementation of ML techniques has been largely focused on black box methods where the general conclusions are not easily interpretable. Hence, the elaboration with other declarative software models to identify the correctness and completeness of the models is not easy to perform. On the other hand, the emerge of some logic-based machine learning techniques with their advantage of white box approach have been proven to be well-suited for many software engineering tasks. In this paper, we propose the use of a logic-based approach to learn user preference in the form of pairwise comparisons. APARELL as a novel approach of inductive learning is able to model the user’s preferences in description logic representation. This offers a rich, relational representation which is then can be used to produce a set of recommendations. A user study has been performed in our experiment to evaluate the implementation of pairwise preference recommender system when compared to a standard list interface. The result of the experiment shows that the pairwise interface was significantly better than the other interface in many ways. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

X is a company engaged in online healthcare and Y is a subsidiary of company X which also acts as a vendor and contributes to the supply of products. In this study, we propose the integration of these two separate applications using the service-oriented architecture concept. SOA concept can support the integration in various platform application in information systems between many organizations. We also used micro services concept to identify and analyze the list of micro services needed.

XYZ in its development requires speed and security because security is one of the key points in product development. As we know, without a safety software system product, customers will never feel confident using the software system product. In software system development, security always faces difficulties, because testing is still done manually so that the testing process also cannot be accelerated. This study discusses how SOA can help this problem and uses one of the appropriate methodologies to support orchestration development. This research will follow the two steps of Service Oriented Architecture Delivery Lifecycle (SOADL) which includes Service Orientation Analysis and Services Orientation Design.

If there is a change or enhancement to one particular module that is made to adjust the business process, then this will have an impact on the functionality of the other modules. Therefore it is necessary to consider other architectural alternatives so that in the future the e-procurement application system is more adaptive to change. So, it can face problems that arise with old architecture. We proposed the design the transformation process using microservices architecture. We use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach. The results showed that the microservices architecture design can produce a system that is more adaptive to a change in which the module is designed to stand alone. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

In this paper, we show the review of Decision Tree implementation for learning user preferences data expressed in pairwise comparisons. Decision Tree can be considered as one of the suitable methods for this problem due to its white-box approach, so that we can evaluate the result and re-use the model for further analysis, such as giving a recommendation. We used 10-fold cross-validation and hold-out technique to evaluate the performance of four different decision tree algorithms. The result shows that some decision tree algorithms like J48 outperform the others for learning pairwise preferences on a specific training split point. This paper has demonstrated, through use cases and experiments of pairwise preference problem, the effectiveness of decision tree method, and of its novel use of learning ordinal data. © 2020 IEEE.","decision tree; machine learning; ordinal data; pairwise comparisons; symbolic approach; user preferences","Decision trees; Learning systems; Trees (mathematics); 10-fold cross-validation; Comparative analysis; Decision tree method; Decision-tree algorithm; Machine learning methods; Ordinal data; Pair-wise comparison; Split points; Learning algorithms",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

The point is, a set of interfaces (can be in the form of functions, methods or endpoint URLs) that we can use to develop applications, both on one platform and across platforms. The purpose of the API is to speed up the creation of an application because programmers do not need to write code from scratch. The API is also provided by a platform to be able to access the features of that platform.

Businesses are also utilizing this very rapid increase in internet technology. They sell products and services through the internet with various attractive offers and competing with each other to increase their sales. One strategy that can be done to get more sales is through the method of personalizing services for customers. The personalization aspect in e-tourism has been predicted to increase. Customers who are making valuable data at every stage of their journey are making a challenge for travel companies to collect and link these data points to improve their customer experience. Learning the customer behaviour can be very significant for Online Travel Agent. Because collecting millions of search results through their services and provide a smart travel experience, Online Travel Agent in Indonesia must use Big Data and Cloud technology alignment to win the competition in the market. The entire data lifecycle must be simple because of the needs of users to keep batch ingesting a lot of data likes once in an hour. Streaming analytics has grown over the past few years, it has become one of the most critical components of most of the businesses.

This is due to inability of the current technology to support the property products. Some people feel uncomfortable to buy houses from the online market. Buyers need to be very careful to deal with the sellers as the houses price is considered quite expensive. On the other hand, improving real estate market is still a challenge. This business still needs a physical representation, although it can be sold from the online market. In this paper, we propose the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) system of virtual reality and drone. We use drone to help scanning the property units and then make 3D models with visual mapping so it can be run in a virtual reality environment, video 360. In real estate, business process can be developed in various ways. Our proposed SOA in this study can be used to integrate all of them. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,"Nabila, M., (2018) APJII: Penetrasi Pengguna Internet Indonesia Capai, p. 143. , www.dailysocial.id/post/apjii-survei-internet-Indonesia-2017, access date 10 April Juta Orang; (2018) Statista Research Department, Number of Internet Users in Indonesia, , https://www.statista.com/statistics/254456/number-of-internet-users-in-Indonesia/, access date 09 April; Ma, Y., Sun, L., On relationship between real estate enterprise e-business model and its performance (2010) 2010 International Conference on Web Information Systems and Mining, p. 171; Xiong-Yi, L., Research and application of soa in b2b electronic commerce (2009) 2009 International Conference on Computer Technology and Development, p. 649; Cherif, E., Grant, D., Analysis of e-business models in real estate (2013) Electronic Commerce Research, 14, pp. 25-50; Footen, J., Service-oriented architecture (SOA) in media systems (2009) SMPTE Motion Imaging Journal, 118, pp. 33-37; Rao, B., Gopi, A.G., Maione, R., The societal impact of commercial drones (2016) Technology in Society, 45, pp. 83-90; Exner, K., Stark, R., Validation of product-service systems in virtual reality (2015) Procedia CIRP, 30, pp. 96-101; Mesbah, A., (2015) Advances in Computers, pp. 201-235. , ed A.

This technology has also been considered an important resource for companies because it has many benefits in its use. The majority of company information systems use more than 1 application for their business needs. These applications will be more useful if integrated with each other. In this paper, we focus on designing the implementation of integration between 2 applications in 2 different companies using the concept of Service Oriented Architecture. With the implementation of using this concept, it is hoped that each application will become free of dependency and exchange data more efficiently. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Almost all payment transactions already use technology, especially in the banking industry. One of the activities of financial transactions in banks is electronification of bill payment transactions and this has become a matter of special concern such as school / university bill payment transactions, tax bill payment transactions, drinking water company bill payment transactions, etc. To accelerate the process of integrating bill payment transactions into all payment provider companies online, of course must use the right concept so that the system can be more effective and efficient, namely using the concept of service oriented architecture (SOA) by using the enterprise service bus (ESB). ESB is used in order to integrate the banking system with the bill payment transaction billing system. In this research the Service Oriented Modeling and Architecture (SOMA) methodology will be applied as a guide in implementing SOA-based solutions. SOA was chosen because it has the nature of interoperability so that it can be relied upon in developing online bill payment transaction systems between bank systems and other systems despite having different system platforms. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Video streaming also includes image processing, in image processing, there is a component to compare the value of an image, which is PSNR. This paper will compare the reactive and proactive routing protocol performance of AOMDV and DSDV using parameters of PSNR, Packet loss, and Throughput in Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) for video streaming. The simulation uses 4, 16, 36, 64, and 100 nodes. The results of the paper are the AOMDV routing protocol with the greater variation in the number of nodes and the distance between nodes resulting in higher packet loss, decreasing throughput, and decreasing values of PSNR. While in DSDV routing protocol with the greater variation in the number of nodes and distance between nodes has an impact on the increase of packet loss value, a very drastic decrease throughput value, a decrease in PSNR value and some scenarios does not produce PSNR values. The comparison of PSNR values between the two routing protocols is also influenced by variations in the number of nodes and distances between nodes along with packet loss and throughput parameters. The greater packet loss will decrease the PSNR value generated. © 2020.

The first is study reports are generally given every quarter or semester, so there is a long enough time span in the delivery of problems or information. The second is, if there is a problem of student development, no quick decision can be made. The third is paper-based study reports are easily damaged and difficult to trace.

Despite their many practical advantages, the users of online shopping systems can be overwhelmed with the abundant information about the goods they want to buy. While some users start their search with a preference for certain items or manufacturers, others may find it difficult to narrow down the range of options being offered. The recommender system can assist the users to filter the information and show the most relevant items to the users. Despite being very popular in ecommerce area, research on recommender systems for education is still underexplored. Similar to the users of ecommerce system, some students may also feel overwhelmed by the available choices of material contents offered by the elearning system in which, it does not always suit to their learning style. This is important as some experts in educational psychology suggest that students need to learn by following their personal learning style. We propose an implementation design of e-learning recommender system based on a logic approach, APARELL (Active Pairwise Relation Learner), which has been implemented for used car sales domain. There is an opportunity to apply the same procedure for e-learning system to help the student to choose the best material according to their preferences. We also propose an ontology of material content based on the different learning styles. In this paper, we show that there is a big potential to implement a personalised recommender system in e-learning based on the students learning style. © 2019 IEEE.","e-learning; education; logic based approach; pairwise user preferences; recommender system","Automobile manufacture; E-learning; Electronic commerce; Intelligent systems; Online systems; Recommender systems; Students; E-commerce systems; Educational psychology; Implementation design; Material content; On-line Shopping systems; Online shopping; Personal learning; Students learning; Learning systems",,,,,,"Rivera, A.C., Tapia-Leon, M., Lujan-Mora, S., Recommendation systems in education: A systematic mapping study (2018) International Conference on Information Theoretic Security, pp. 937-947. , Springer, Cham; Rich, E., User modeling via stereotypes (1979) Cognitive Science, 3 (4), pp. 329-354; Yu, Z., Nakamura, Y., Jang, S., Kajita, S., Mase, K., Ontology-based semantic recommendation for context-Aware e-learning (2007) International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing, pp. 898-907. , Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg; Shishehchi, S., Banihashem, S.Y., Zin, N.A.M., A proposed semantic recommendation system for e-learning: A rule and ontology based e-learning recommendation system (2010) 2010 International Symposium on Information Technology, 1, pp. 1-5. , IEEE; Kolekar, S.V., Sanjeevi, S.G., Bormane, D.S., Learning style recognition using Artificial Neural Network for adaptive user interface in e-learning (2010) 2010 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research, Coimbatore, pp. 1-5; Tarus, J., Zhendong, N., Khadidja, B., E-learning recommender system based on collaborative filtering and ontology (2017) International Journal of Computer, Electrical, Automation, Control and Information Engineering, 11 (2), pp. 256-261. , World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology; Benhamdi, S., Babouri, A., Chiky, R., Personalized recommender system for e-Learning environment (2017) Education and Information Technologies, 22 (4), pp. 1455-1477; Strainu, R.M.P., Georgescu, M., SOA the link between modern educational technologies and mobile learning in the Higher Education Landscape (2017) Timisoara Journal of Economics and Business, 10 (1), pp. 120-133; Jati, G., Teaching Writing using web-log (2006) International Conference on Competency-Based Learning.

In the digital era, the use of mobile banking is a utility function for the need to perform daily financial activities such as bill payment and fund transfer. Addressing potential fraud in mobile banking services is a challenge for banks to make IT security systems remain confident, integrity, and available. Potential attacks on IT security will occur from the internal side of the organization as well as from external parties. In maintaining the level of security and convenience of customers in using e-banking services, banks try to make a tool to be able to prevent the occurrence of a large risk of loss in future. The most potential that will become an attack is social engineering and data theft by internal employees, in this research the focus is to discuss the two potential attacks on accounts that have long been dormant and deal with them with an application with the SOA approach. © 2019 IEEE.","application; fraud detection; Service Oriented Architecture (SOA); smart mobile","Applications; Electronic commerce; Information services; Security of data; Security systems; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Confidential data; Financial activity; Financial information; Fraud detection; Mobile applications; smart mobile; Social engineering; Utility functions; Crime",,,,,,"King, B., (2010) Bank 2.0: How Customer Behavior and Technology Will Change the Future of Financial Services, , Banker (1st ed.).

(2) Rate of change, customers request more frequent release cycles to compensate for changes in information and service requirements. (3) Quality of change, Increased application scalability. For that reason, IT organizations in making business changes need to do what needs to be modular in developing applications and deployments. Architectural Microservices (MSA) is an alternative architecture in building an application. The MSA conversion process can start patterns that are adapted to future needs. The release cycle is carried out by implementing automation for continuous delivery and continuous integration into continuous development, transforming data services into service forms, so as to answer the challenges of digital transformation. In this paper explains how to transform architects and their design in the E-Procurement application system using MSA. © BEIESP.","And E-Procurement; Architecture; Cloud Computing; Microservices; SOA",,,,,,,"Overcoming Ongoing Digital Transformational Challenges with a Microservices Architecture (2015) Cogniz, pp. 1-9. , 20-20 Insights, no. november; (2019) Microservices, , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices; Lestari, W.P., Sujarwo, A., DevOps: Disrupsi Pengelolaan ICT Pendidikan Tinggi (2018) Semin.

IoT can be applied in various fields such as smart city, smart transportation, agriculture, weather monitoring and other fields. In this research, design and development of Cloud computing based Internet of Things for weather monitoring based on temperature, humidity and rainfall of surrounding environment parameters as message, and using MQTT which is IoT/M2M connectivity protocol. There are three main components of MQTT: the first component that generates the message is called a publisher, the second that consumes messages is called a subscriber, and the last component that handles the interaction between the publisher and the subscriber is called a broker or intermediary. Usability testing is also done from each component of the system using the black box approach that can represent overall functionality. Based on the design model of weather monitoring system, end-user can monitor weather conditions according to the placement node device of location and through Web-based applications installed on the cloud server.

In this paper we assess and analyze the implementation and support process using ITIL v3 - COBIT 5 Mapping. With objective to create practical guidance for measuring maturity of the process, assess capability level of the process, and make recommendation that can be applied to company's business process. As the result of assessment, we conclude that mean capability level of implementation and support process is 0.71. This indicates that majority of the process do not achieve level 1 capability level and failed to achieve its objective or fail to deliver any process evidence. As for recommendation we propose two short term solution, fulfill uncompleted base practice and focusing in development of Information Management System. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Condensed matter physics; Engineering; Industrial engineering; Materials science; Business Process; Information management systems; ITIL V3; Level-1; Market environment; Practical guidance; Process maturity; Short-term solutions; Information management",,,,,,"Collyer, S., Project management approaches for dynamic environments (2009) International Journal of Project Management, 27 (4), pp. 355-364. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijproman.2008.04.004; Khan, M.W.J., Khalique, M., Strategic Planning and Reality of External Environment of Organizations in Contemporary Business Environments (2014) Business Management and Strategy, 5 (2), p. 165. , http://doi.org/10.5296/bms.v5i2.6794; Karkoskova, S., Feuerlicht, G., Extending MBI Model using ITIL and COBIT Processes (2015) Journal of Systems Integration, 5, pp. 29-44. , http://doi.org/10.20470/jsi.v6i4.244; Latif, A.A., Hanifi, N., Analyzing IT Function Using COBIT 4.1 - A Case Study of Malaysian Private University (2013) Journal of Economics, Business and Management, 1, pp. 406-408. , http://doi.org/10.7763/JOEBM.2013.V1.87; Isaca, (2013) COBIT: A Business Framework for the Governance and Management of Enterprise IT; Menevse, B.A., Case, S., (2012) Toward Better IT Governance with COBIT, 5, p. 2. , 4(October 2011); Karkoskova, S., Feuerlicht, G., Extending MBI Model using ITIL and COBIT Processes (2015) Journal of Systems Integration, 5, pp. 29-44. , http://doi.org/10.20470/jsi.v6i4.244; Mourad, M.B., Al, Hussain, M., The Impact of Cloud Computing on ITIL Service Strategy Processes (2014) International Journal of Computer and Communication Engineering, 3 (5), pp. 367-371. , http://doi.org/10.7763/IJCCE.2014.V3.35; Fajar, A.N., Budiardjo, E.K., Hasibuan, Z.A., System Architecture in Dynamic Environment based on Commonality and Variability Business Processes (2012) 8th ICCM Seoul, , (Seoul: IEEE); Fajar, A.N., Shofi, I.M., Reduced software complexity for E-Government applications with ZEF framework Telkomnika (Telecommunication Computing Electronics and Control), 15, pp. 415-420",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","2nd Nommensen International Conference on Technology and Engineering, NICTE 2018","19 July 2018 through 20 July 2018",,140093,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Blended learning refers to combining traditional classroom learning with e-learning with the aims to enrich entire learning process. From the last decade, we have seen the strong growth of millenials students in Indonesian higher education institutions. They developed high familiarity with Internet technology, social media and smartphone uses. The needs of adopting social media into blended learning has become essential part in blended learning mode nowadays. For this reason, the article takes a popular method, Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) enables to enrich the entire e-learning environment. We apply the VLE dashboard with adopting the Web-based Synchronized Multimedia Lecture (WSML) framework that enables to provide authoring tool to record the temporal and spatial relationships among media involved and facilitate synchronize presentation across media access. This framework has advantages to promote the real-time collaboration amongst students and teacher(s), like in a classroom setting, but with online mode. VLE takes advantages of web 2.0 and social media technology that enables to conduct real time meeting with video conference and easy exchange multimedia files. The outcome of the article is expected to provide social media learning based system that can be apply in higher education institutions to avoid boredom in traditional blended learning. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Computer aided instruction; Electronic document exchange; Multimedia services; Social networking (online); Students; Teaching; Classroom settings; E-learning environment; Effective learning; Higher education institutions; Internet technology; Real-time collaboration; Temporal and spatial; Virtual learning environments; E-learning",,,,,,"Bhutawale, S., Sakharkar, P., What Is E-Learning?; Riahi, G., E-learning systems based on cloud computing: A review (2015) Procedia Comput Sci., 62, pp. 352-359. , Scse; Gikas, J., Grant, M.M., Mobile computing devices in higher education: Student perspectives on learning with cellphones, smartphones & social media (2013) Internet High Educ., 19, pp. 18-26; Hassanzadeh, A., Kanaani, F., Elahi, S., A model for measuring e-learning systems success in universities (2012) Expert Syst Appl., 39 (12), pp. 10959-10966; Mason, R., Rennie, F., E-Learning and Social Networking Handbook (2008) British Journal of Educational Technology, 40, p. 189; Gibson, L.A., Sodeman, W.A., Millennials and technology: Addressing the communication gap in education and practice (2014) Organ Dev J., 32, pp. 63-75; Lister, M., Trends in the Design of E-Learning and Online Learning (2014) J Online Learn Teach., 10, pp. 671-680; Al-Adwan, A., Al-Adwan, A., Smedley, J., Exploring students acceptance of e-learning using Technology Acceptance Model in Jordanian universities (2013) Int J Educ Dev Using Inf Commun Technol., 9, pp. 4-18; Zakarian, S., (2013) Abstract Education and Social Media: An Examination of Facebook, Twitter and Youtube in K-12 Education, , May 2013; Scholar, M.D., Thoene, W.S., (2012) The Impact of Social Networking Sites on College Students' Consumption Patterns; Panekham, A., (2014) Exploring the Role Social Media Plays in the Student Learning Experience of 2014 University Life in NZ, p. 79. , November; Scott, K.M., Does a university teacher need to change e-learning beliefs and practices when using a social networking site?

Organization that has lack of IT governance also experiences lack of good corporate governance. As a result, the organization has difficulties to link its IT benefits to organization's objectives. In some cases, the lack of IT governance even causes severe impacts to school management. The article takes case of a higher institution, STMIK MBM, one of popular IT school in North Sulawesi, that has experienced with frequent IT interruption. The frequent IT interruption has caused severe consequences not only to current school operation, but also to the reputation of the school. In the beginning year of 2017, the ineffective academic data management has caused the severe interruption of school operation and led to the change of school management.

This phenomenon is happened by the belief that lack of capturing user requirement. This is due to consider the business environment is always running normally. In fact, the development of the system needs a way to anticipate the business environment that unpredictable changes.Therefore, the phenomenon on the need for modeling services can able to respond to the changing needs of users still have a chancein this study. It explores modeling services to synergize SOA and BPM.Several previous studies generally use a business driven approach, technical partially driven to develop the service modeling. This leads to the question of how a service should be modeled so that it can be applied in different contexts and business processes also. It is support user needs in diversity and heterogeneous system environments. This Conditions occurs in corporate university. The case studies in this research is a Learning Management System (LMS) in Academic Enterprise System (EAS). The research stages are: (1) Analysis of Synergy in SOA and BPM, (2) Analysis of User Experience in LMS Academic Enterprise System (L-EAS), (3) Analysis of Modeling Framework, (4) Proposed Framework that aligning SOA and BPM. The result of this study is proposed system framework based on services to increase the flexibility of information systems at LMS Academic Enterprise System (L-EAS).

Furthermore, the development of Service Oriented Architecture technology is now adopted in various fields. The use of Smart Agriculture System can help people who work in an agricultural sector. Components in Smart Agriculture Systems integrated an entity such as hotel, hospital, logistic, restaurant, supermarket and traditional market who can get a message, information, and data throughout Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). Service Oriented Architecture help to share information and data very quickly because using SOA connects various actors in the material sales industry. The usage of SOA in the field of agriculture is expected to help the economy in Indonesia and also can suppress prices so it will not soar. This high price is caused by various factors such as lack of technological knowledge among farmers. There are still many brokers who become third parties from the distribution of agricultural food ingredients in Indonesia. With the implementation of SOA, it is expected to help farmers for a better living. © 2018 IEEE.","Agriculture; Enterprise Service Bus; Service Oriented Architecture; Smart Agriculture Systems","Agriculture; Information services; Information systems; Information use; Agricultural foods; Agricultural sector; Enterprise service bus; High price; Smart agricultures; Technological knowledge; Third parties; Traditional markets; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,,"Indonesia, S., (2016) Badan Pusat Statistik.

The task of integrating such system is quite complicated, especially the integration of the financial technology system. In addition to being integrated, the flow of data and business processes must effectively reach every part which has interests in the process and the data. Business productivity can be achieved if the required data flows smoothly and is accessible as efficient as possible. Similarly, a bank which usually uses more than one information systems, when it need to combine financial statements from different bank systems must go through a data transformation mechanism to be accessible. Especially if the users of some bank accounts must access all their banking accounts at one time, of course, this would not be easy. As a response to those situations, in this research we proposed a financial technology application integration based on SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) which could be used to combine financials statements of all integrated banks every month. The data required to create a composite report will be directly taken from the system of any bank by utilizing web services. It is expected that the results from this study could help the parties interested in SOA-based Fin Tech with the understanding and description of SOA, such as: how it works, its benefits, and the role of SOA layers implemented in Fin Tech applications. © 2018 IEEE.","Architecture; Fin Tech; SOA; System","Architecture; Citrus fruits; Finance; Fins (heat exchange); Information services; Integration; Metadata; Web services; Business productivity; Customer expectation; Fin Tech; Financial transactions; Soa (serviceoriented architecture); System; Technology application; Technology Integration; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,,"Papazoglou, M.P., Georgakopoulos, D., Service oriented computing: Introduction (2003) Communications of the ACM, 46 (10), pp. 25-28; Meredith, L.G., Bjorg, S., Contracts and types (2003) Communications of the ACM, 46 (10), pp. 41-47; Arsanjani, A., (2004) Service-oriented Modeling and Architecture, p. 2; Josuttis Nicloai, M., SOA in practice (2007) O'Relly 2007, p. 210; Richard, B., (2005) Extensible Architectures: The Strategic Value of Service-oriented Architecture in Banking, , Department of Computer Information Systems, Robinson College of Business, Georgia State University; Bret, K., (2010) Bank 2.0: How Customer Behaviour and Technology Will Change the Future of Financial Services-Marshall Cavendish, , Business; Riad, A.M., Hassan, Q.F., Service-oriented architecture-A new alternative to traditional integration methods in B2B applications (2008) JCIT, 3 (1). , March 31, 2008; Papazoglou, M.P., Service-oriented computing: Concepts, characteristics, and directions (2003) Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE'03); Fajar, A.N., Legowo, N., Services modeling based on SOA and BPM for information system flexibility improvement (2018) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 8 (4), pp. 2451-2455; Fajar, A.N., Nurcahyo, A., Sriratnasari, S.R., SOA system architecture for interconnected modern higher education in Indonesia (2018) Procedia Computer Science the 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Computational Intelligence (ICCSCI 2018); 10 Best Android Budget Apps for Money Management, , https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-budget-apps-for-moneymanagement-586807/, Android Authority, 16-Jul-2018.

Indonesian enterprises have experience with a huge amount of investments and ended up with minor benefits. Despite its unprecedented benefits, the SAP strategy is still considered as a mandatory enterprise system for every enterprise to compete in the marketplaces. The article examines the SAP implementation from cultural perspectives to present new horizon that commonly ignored by major Indonesian enterprises. The article applies the multiple case studies with three large Indonesia enterprises, such as KS, the largest steel producer; GEM, a subsidiary of conglomerate enterprise operates in the mining industry, and HS, a subsidiary of the largest retailer in Asia with more than 700 stores in Indonesia. The outcome of the article is expected to provide a comprehensive analysis from cultural perspectives regarding to common problems faced by SAP consultants. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Steelmaking; Comprehensive analysis; Enterprise system; Implementation strategies; Indonesia; Large enterprise; Multiple-case study; Steel producers; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,,"Boersma, K., Kingma, S., (2005) Developing A Cultural Perspective on ERP, 11, pp. 123-136; Musa, U., Usman, Z., (2012) Knowledge Management in Success of ERP Systems, 3, pp. 21-28; Hwang, W., (2011) The Drivers of ERP Implementation and Its Impact on Organizational Capabilities and Performance and Customer Value, pp. 1-301. , June; De Souza, J.M.E., (2004), pp. 1-313. , Definition and analysis of Critical Success Factors for ERP implementation projects Thesis; Ehie, I.C., Madsen, M., Identifying critical issues in enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation (2005) Comput Ind., 56 (6), pp. 545-557; Hidayanto, A.N., Ma, H., Handayani, P.W., Sucahyo, Y.G., Framework for measuring ERP implementation readiness in small and medium enterprise (SME): A case study in software developer company (2013) J Comput., 8 (7), pp. 1777-1782; Zaglago, L., Apulu, I., Chapman, C., Shah, H., The Impact of Culture in Enterprise Resource Planning System Implementation (2013) Proc World Congr Eng., 1, pp. 3-8; Rabaai, A., (2009) The Impact of Organisational Culture on Erp Systems Implementation : Lessons from Jordan the Impact of Organisational Culture on Erp; Skok, W., Doringer, H., Potential impact of cultural differences on enterprise resource planning (ERP) projects (2002) Electron J Inf Syst Dev Ctries [Internet], 7, pp. 1-8. , Available from: http://www.ejisdc.org; Ewn, B., IT governance for enterprise resource planning supported by the DeLone-McLean model of information systems success (2008) Inf Manag., 45 (5), pp. 257-269; Williams, R., Edge, D., The social shaping of technology (1996) Res Policy, 25 (6), pp. 865-899; Davenport, T.H., Harris, J.G., Cantrell, S., Davenport, T.H., Harris, J.G., Cantrell, S., (2004) Enterprise Systems and Ongoing Process Change; Akram, K., Role of Knowledge Management to Bring Innovation : An Integrated Approach (2011) Int Bus Res., 11, pp. 121-134; Ugrin, J.C., Morris, J.J., Ott, R.L., A study of how underperforming firms follow industry leaders when adopting ERP systems and the economic effects of their adoption decisions (2016) Commun Assoc Inf Syst., 39, pp. 52-72; Bhattacharya, P.J., Seddon, P.B., Scheepers, R., Enterprise systems for innovation in products and processes: Beyond operational efficiency (2012) ACIS 2012: Location, Location, Location: Proceedings of the 23rd Australasian Conference on Information Systems 2012, pp. 1-11; Hayes, David, C., Hunton, James, E., Reck, J.L., Market Reaction to Auditor Changes.pdf (2001) Journal of Information Systems, 15 (1), pp. 3-18; Markus, M.L., Tanis, C., The Enterprise System Experience-From Adoption to Success (2000) Fram Domains IT Manag Proj Futur Through Past, pp. 173-207; Nah, F.F., Delgado, S., Critical Success Factors for Enterprise Resource Planning Implementation and Upgrade (2006) J Comput Inf Syst., 47, pp. 99-113; Olie, R., The'culture'factor in personnel and organization policies (1995) Int Hum Resour Manag London Sage; Sedera, D., Gable, G.G., Knowledge management competence for enterprise system success (2010) J Strateg Inf Syst., 19 (4), pp. 296-306; Fryling M.

In order to handle conflict (inconsistency) is one of active areas in the research of Goal Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE). Ontology is used to capture the knowledge of certain domain wished. One of the features of Ontology described using OWL is the checking of consistency. The case study is Indonesian Government Tourism System. This paper presents how to develop software product line in Indonesian Government with the Ontology OWL that used for the consistency checking in the software product line for e-government applications. It is important, because the software product line would be derived from goal model that has been consistent and no conflict These paper presents how the Ontology OWL act to handle inconsistency checking in goal model. The first step conducted is to convert the goal model into Ontology using Protégé. Parallel with the first step, Ontology with equipped carried out the checking consistency of terminology, designation, and structure. The next step is to conduct the checking of logic consistency (Strong conflict and/or Weak conflict) by defining the rules using SWRL Tab. © 2016, ASERS Publishing House.

The requirement should meets with its purpose. In order to achieve it, the methodology for requrement analysis is needed. Nowdays, the complexity of e-governemnt applications is grown significantly in the government environment. E-government applications should be developed based on regulations in order to achieve the goal model of government entitties. However, the goal model could not used directly to make business process model. In order to solve this problem,this paper presents and proposed a Methodology to extract goal model into business process model that called GBPM Methodology. It can support the requirement analysis phase, especially in enterprise government tourism system. This methodology consists of two methods, there are (1) Method for convert goal model to business use case diagram, (2) Method for convert business use case diagram to activity diagram. We do the experiment in e-government applications domain. This methodology suitable with enterprise government tourism system development.

The change related to the time, cost, effort and quality. This situation forces the system to improve its reusability in terms of commonality and variability business processes. In order to response to it, we develop mechanism for system architecture that based on technical and business process alignment approach. We proposed system architecture that characterizes by business process commonality and variability. The proposed system architecture consists of busines process layer, user interface layer, application layer, integration layer, legacy business process layer and data layer. Variant of business processes and tasks can be embedded to one another. Beside that, it can support substitution and replacement among part of business processes and tasks that make possible for sharing parts among entitites. The entitiy can choose suitable parts of common and specific business processes in dynamic environment. Hence, the system architecture can minimize time, cost, effort and improve software quality for information system. © 2012 AICIT.","business processes; commonality & variability; dynamic environment; reusability; system architecture","Application layers; Business Process; Commonality and variability; Data layer; Dynamic environments; Information system development; Interface layer; Software Quality; System architectures; Computer software selection and evaluation; Information management; Information systems; User interfaces; Reusability",,,,,,"Machado, I., (2011) Managing Variability in Business Processes: An Aspect-Oriented Approach, , ACM 978-1-4503-0645-4111/03... $10.00; Svahnberg, M., Van Gurp, J., Bosch, J., A taxonomy of variability realization techniques (2005) Softw.,Pract.

But even if Shinzo Abe had tried since 2006 to change the constitution, this effort still opposed by the Japanese people. Mass media is one of the tools that could be used to communication through people. Gate : Jieitai Kano Chi te kaku tatakaeri, is one of Japanese anime that represent Japanese Self Defense Force in mass media. Through this research author will analyse the narration of Gate Jieitai Kano Chi te Kaku Tatakaeri, and show how have Japanese Self Defense Force have been represent in this anime in its relation to the Special Region, which I argue was the representation of the country that Japan had been invade during the world war II. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Military operations; Mass media; Self-defense forces; World war II; Network security",,,,,"Krebs, G., World War Zero?

Kemanggisan Ilir III No. 45 Palmerah, Jakarta Barat, 11480, Indonesia","Japan’s defeat at World War II gives a huge impact to the Japanese people. The defeat caused Japanese people collective memory to be changed, and it was unchanged for decades after it. The Japanese people feel responsible for the cruelty that they came up with, so they create a constitution that stated the renunciation of war and will never admitting/the rejection of any military power. This Constitution is called the Pacifist constitution. Nowadays, Japan has a third largest defense budget, yet their constitution interpretation still insist that “Self Defense Force” is for defense purposes only. Through this paper, author would like to analyze three Gundam movies from three different eras, which show how Japanese have changed their traumatic collective memory of World War II. Moreover, I tried to analyze and find out how the Japanese have change from the traumatic past to the current society which is shown by the popular culture phenomenon, Gundam. From the results of the study, it was found that the Gundam series reflected the condition of society in each era and there is meaning transformation of Gundam on opposition to the Self-Defense Forces into support for the Japanese Self-Defense Forces. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Collective memory; Mobile suit gundam; Pacifist constitution",,,,,,"Nishikawa, T., (2009) The Future of Japanesse Constitution: From the Macarthur Constitution to What?; Auer, J.E., (1990) Article Nine of Japan’s Constitution: From Renunciation of Armed Force “Forever” to the Third Largest Defence Budget in the World; Mariko, O., (2012) Japan’s Contradictory Military Might; Martin, C., (2007) The Case against “Revising Interpretations” of the Japanese Constitution; Allen, M., Sakamoto, R., (2006) Popular Culture and Globalisation in Japan, p. 188; Napier, S.J., (2005) World War II as Trauma, Memory and Fantasy in Japanese Animation; Williams, M., (2010) Imag(In)Ing War in Japan: Representing and Responding in Postwar Literature and Film, p. 329; Hikawa, R., (2013) Japanese Animation Guide: The History of Robot Anime, p. 23; Kusno, A., (2007) Gardu Di Perkotaan Jawa, p. 7; Rabkin, E.S., (2013) Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World, , University of Michigan; Fowler, B., (2007) Obituary as Collective Memory, p. 27; Fowler, B., (2007) Obituary as Collective Memory, pp. 30-31; Hoed, B.H., (2011) Semiotik Dan Dinamika Sosial Budaya, p. 3; Denzin, N.K., (2009) Hand Book of Qualitative Research, p. 617; Pradopo, R.D., (2007) Pengkajian Puisi, p. 121; Nurgiyantoro, B., (2010) Teori Pengkajian Fiksi, p. 40; Alex, S., Analisis Teks Media Suatu Pengantar untuk Analisis Wacana, Analisis Semiotik (2004) Analisis Framing, p. 100; Hoed, B.H., (2011) Semiotik Dan Dinamika Sosial Budaya, p. 88; Alex, S., Analisis Teks Media Suatu Pengantar untuk Analisis Wacana, Analisis Semiotik (2004) Analisis Framing, p. 97; Budiman, K., (2011) Semiotika Visual: Konsep, Isu, Dan Problem Ikonisitas, p. 4; Edy, J.A., (2006) Troubled past News and the Collective Memory of Social Unrest, p. 4","Hermawan, D.; Faculty of Humanities, Jln.

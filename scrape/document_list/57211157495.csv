Cellroom has a very large number of valves that vary greatly in terms of model, service and size but in one place that is not wide so that the valve location is often close together sometimes even coincide. The objective of this research is to analysis work posture using RULA method on operator cellroon electrolyser. Valve layout that is difficult to reach and heavy rotation to operate also sometimes the operator must squat and bend when operating most of the valves. The results shows, RULA identified the high risk in performing job task in cellroom electrolyser. A survey method developed for the usefulness of ergonomic investigations in the workplace, in which occupational upper body muscle disease is identified. This tool does not require special equipment in providing posture measurements of the neck, back, arms and upper body as the function of the muscles and the external burden of the body. As a result, several design and tools were proposed to increase the operator's performance in cellroom electrolyser. © IEOM Society International.","Fatigue; Human error; Oil and gas plants; Petrochemical; Shift work",,,,,,"Kelly, C., (2005) The beauty of fit: Proportion and anthropometry in chair design, , Georgia Institute and Technology; Brian, M.K., (2005) Macroergonomics analysis and design of work systems.

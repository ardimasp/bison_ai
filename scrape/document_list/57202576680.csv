This study aims to determine whether the use of Computer Assisted Audit Techniques (CAATs) in the audit process has an impact on the performance of auditors and Generate conclusions in the form of evaluation of Computer Assisted Audit Techniques (CAATs) in the audit process in order to have a positive impact on auditor performance.To evaluate the impact of using Computer Assisted Audit Techniques (CAATs). are Quantity of Work, Quality of Work, Job Knowledge, Creativeness Cooperation, Dependability, Initiative, personal qualities, and Timeliness. The method used in this research is qualitative method is descriptive analytical and evaluative, by analyzing the impact of using Computer Assisted Audit Techniques (CAATs) to auditor performance components. The results obtained are the use of Computer Assisted Audit Techniques (CAATs) have a positive impact on auditor performance components. © 2018 IEEE.","CAATS; internal auditor; performance","Information management; Technology transfer; CAATS; Computer-assisted audit techniques; internal auditor; performance; Personal qualities; Positive impacts; Qualitative method; Quality of work; Computer aided analysis",,,,,,"(2012), Agoes.Sukrisno.

Serum osmolalities (SOs) in fish unexposed to Cd (0 mg l−1) and exposed to 2.5 mg Cd l−1 were not significantly different at salinities of 0, 5 and 10 g l−1, while at 15 g l−1, SO was significantly higher than at 0, 5 and 10 g l−1. Levels of Na+ and Cl− in serum at salinities of 5, 10 and 15 g l−1 were not significantly different; but were significantly higher than those at 0 g l−1 with and without Cd. In media without Cd, the lowest level of K+ in serum occurred at 15 g l−1 salinity, whereas levels of K+ at 0, 5 and 10 g l−1 were not significantly different. The levels of K+ in Cd-exposed fish at all salinities were not significantly different. At 0 g l−1 salinity, hemoglobin, red blood cells, and hematocrit in Cd-exposed fish were significantly lower than controls. At salinities of 5, 10 and 15 g l−1, levels in control and Cd-exposed fish were not significantly different indicating that higher salinity prevented Cd-induced osmotic imbalance and hematological alterations. © 2018, © 2018 Nature Research Centre.","Cadmium; hematology; Oreochromis niloticus; osmoregulation; salinity; serum ions",,,,,"Universitas Airlangga, UNAIR","This research was supported by the research mandate of Universitas Airlangga.

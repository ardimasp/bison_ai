The spelling check method aims to verify and correct misspelled words through a series of suggested words that are closer to the wrong word. Currently, Spell checkers for English language are well established. This article analyses several studies conducted in various types of languages other than English. Like Africa, Arabia, China, Indonesia, India, Japan, Malaysia and Thailand. We use the systematic literature Review approach to paper published 2008 - 2018. there are 23 papers to represent each language and view methods used. The result show that each language has a different Spelling Check Method. The Damerau-Levenshtein algorithm method is most often used for spelling checkers. © 2019 IEEE.","algorithm method; spelling checker; systematic literature review","Algorithm methods; Document quality; English languages; Indonesia; Spell-checking; Spelling checker; Spelling checks; Systematic literature review; Information management",,,,,"Knierim, P., Schwind, V., Feit, A.M., Nieuwenhuizen, F., Henze, N., Physical keyboards in virtual reality: Analysis of typing performance and effects of avatar hands (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Confer-ence on Human Factors in Computing Systems-CHI '18; Fleischer, A.B., Increasing incidence within PubMed of the use of the misspelling pruritis (sic) instead of pruritus for itch (2016) Acta Dermato-Venereologica, 96 (6), pp. 826-827; Furugori, T., Improving spelling checkers for Japanese users of english (1990) IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, 33 (3), pp. 138-142; Wint, Z.Z., Ducros, T., Aritsugi, M., Spell corrector to social media datasets in message filtering systems (2018) 2017 12th International Conference on Digital Information Management, ICDIM 2017, 2018, pp. 209-215. , Janua Icdim; Octaviano, M., Borra, A., A spell checker for a low-resourced and morphologically rich language (2017) IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON, 2017, pp. 1853-1856. , Decem; Low, S.W., Investment performance analysis of managerial expertise: Evidence from Malaysian-based international equity unit trust funds (2013) Jurnal Pengurusan, 38, pp. 41-51. , July 2014; Grobbelaar L, A., Kinyua, J.D.M., A spell checker and corrector for the native South African language, South Sotho (2009) Proceedings of the 2009 Annual Conference of the Southern African Computer Lecturers' Association On-SACLA '09, pp. 50-59. , http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1562741.1562747; Naroua, H., Salifou, L., On the computerization of african languages (2016) American Journal of Applied Sciences, 13 (11), pp. 1228-1234; Madi, N., Al-Khalifa, H.S., A proposed Arabic grammatical error detection tool based on deep learning (2018) Procedia Computer Science, 142, pp. 352-355; Al-Jefri, M.M., Mahmoud, S.A., Context-sensitive Arabic spell checker using context words and n-gram language models (2015) Proceedings-2013 Taibah University International Conference on Advances in Information Technology for the Holy Quran and Its Sciences, NOORIC 2013, pp. 258-263; Mohammed, N., Abdellah, Y., The vocabulary and the morphology in spell checker (2018) Procedia Computer Science, 127, pp. 76-81; Dhanju, K.S., Lehal, G.S., Saini, T.S., Kaur, A., Design and implementation of shahmukhi spell checker (2015) Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 8 (27); Setiadi, I., Damerau-levenshtein algorithm and bayes theorem for spell checker optimization (2013) Sekolah Teknik Elektro Dan Informatika Institut Teknologi Bandung, , December; Chiu, H.-W., Wu, J.-C., Chang, J.S., (2013) Chinese Spelling Checker Based on Statistical Machine Translation, pp. 49-53. , October; Yeh, W.-Y., Chen, J.-F., Su, M.-C., Chinese spelling checker based on an inverted index list with a rescoring mechanism spelling checker based on an inverted index list with a rescoring mechanism (2015) ACM Trans.

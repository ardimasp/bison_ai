The study was conducted by traffic count survey and followed by a roadside interview survey. Stated Preference method was used in order to analyse trip forecasting value. Mode choice model of new trip mode plans (Cisumdawu Toll Road) and current intercity road for Cileunyi - Sumedang is (UJT -UJR ) = 0.1079-0.507726x 1-0.8953764x 2, while Sumedang - Cileunyi is (UJT -UJR ) = 0.0790-0.301341x 1-0.548446x 2. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to obtain the forecasting of private vehicle that diverts to the new toll road (Cisumdawu Toll Road). Trip characteristics such as trip origin and destination, types of trips, occupations, salary, and others become a motive for respondents to choose a new trip mode. Results of the new trip mode forecasting that prefer to divert to the toll road in terms of the value of cost and time for Cileunyi - Sumedang are 74.11% and 86.62% respectively, while for Sumedang - Cileunyi are 69.60% and 76.48% respectively. These results are relatively high compare to toll planning document. The impact of this results can be determined such as lower overall fuel consumption, lower pollution and more important is the maintenance cost of national road will be decrease. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","intercity road; multiple linear regression; state preference; toll road","Automobiles; Compensation (personnel); Forecasting; Linear regression; Regression analysis; Roads and streets; Surveys; Toll highways; intercity road; Mode choice models; Multiple linear regression analysis; Multiple linear regressions; Origin and destinations; Private vehicles; state preference; Stated preference method; Transportation",,,,,"Surbakti, M.S., Bombongan, C., Characteristic of modal choice preference between bus and train from Medan to Kuala Namu airport (2017) IOP.

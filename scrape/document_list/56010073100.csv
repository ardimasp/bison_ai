Radicalism gives destructive impacts to an attacked country and the global society. It is not only makes a serious threat to a nation unity, yet it also impacts the cultural, socio-political, and economic among the others. This study is aim to study radicalism intention using content detection. The model was developed using social media content like posting, comment and conversation to indicate the level of radicalism. Data was collected from a Twitter. It has chosen as a social media platform because Twitter can engage the community with powerful and impactful microblogging function. The data was analyzed using machine learning. To be specifically, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) in text mining employed for classification of Twitter's content in national language of republic Indonesia. There were two focus keywords used in this study. The first one is ISIS and follow by Syria. The result shows that 83.3% accuracy of test set tuples, 90% part of the contents indicates positive link to radicalism with no-radicalism class as a precision value. Besides recall value was calculated for accuracy, 95% and 82% part of actual text positively link as radicalism class with a proxy of no-radicalism class. This model is hoped to detect and overcome the terrorism issue in Indonesia. © 2020 IEEE.","Machine learning; Radicalism; Support vector machine; Terrorism; Twitter","Information management; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Text mining; Content detection; Global society; Microblogging; National language; Social media; Social media platforms; Support vector machine techniques; Test sets; Support vector machines",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

Most sentiment analysis employed for English text. Contrarily, a plethora method for sentiment analysis has been reported that the task stayed an interesting question for Indonesian text. The invention of machine learning models and broad accessibility of Twitter data on previous years have derived many researchers to take a machine learning model to resolve the sentiment analysis problem. The objective of this study is to build a sentiment analysis model using Sentiwordnet and machine learning for Indonesia general election opinion in Indonesian text from the twitter content. The data of the tweet was taken namely, the username, and the tweet itself. The theme of the tweet was the topic related to the 2019 general election figures, namely Joko Widodo and Prabowo Subianto. The period of data collection was November 13, 2018, to January 11, 2019, during the campaign period. The tweet was in Indonesia language. The result revealed sentiment analysis with the Naïve Bayes classification method showed 74.94% accuracy for Joko Widodo topic, while 71.37% accuracy for Prabowo topic. © 2019 IEEE.","naïve bayes classification; sentiment analysis; SentiWordNet; twitter","Information management; Machine learning; Social networking (online); Bayes classification; Computational process; Data collection; General Elections; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning models; SentiWordNet; twitter; Sentiment analysis",,,,"Binus University","ACKNOWLEDGMENT We appreciatively admit the support from Research and Technology Transfer office (TO), Bina Nusantara University which helped the funding for this paper.",,"Adiyana, I., Hakim, R.F., Implementasi text mining pada mesin pencarian Twitter untuk menganalisis topik-topik terkait KPK dan Jokowi (2015) Prosiding Seminar Nasional Matematika Dan Pendidikan Matematika UMS 2015, pp. 570-581. , Yogyakarta: Universitas Muhammadiyah Surakarta; Pertiwi, W.K., (2018) Riset Ungkap Pola Pemakaian Medsos Orang Indonesia, , https://tekno.kompas.com, Kompas, March 1, Kompas.

The key strategy is by providing credit project fund to various social communities all over Indonesia in order to enhance capability and productivity of the communities themselves. To get the funding, the communities give the proposals which will be verified by the management of PNPM Mandiri. The proposal assessment has many criteria to determine the feasibility of proposal. To support the decision making made by PNPM management, therefore we developed a decision support system (DSS) that supports the Government Loan allocation. The result shows that the DSS help the PNPM management to customize the existing model.

This paper focused on airport domain in Indonesia since detection of airport imagery features was an open challenge due to various features were used to describe the visual existence of an airport. Main characteristics of real-world definition for airport domain were identified by using the reference from Klasifikasi Penutup Lahan SNI 7645 Badan Standardisasi Nasional (Land Cover Classification SNI 7645 National Standardization Body) and Ministry of the Transportation Republic of Indonesia. Subsequently, image description of airport domain was defined based on the real-world description of the airport. This description used image features consideration namely spatial, spectral (color and texture) which was organized as ontological properties itself. At the end, the formal representation of airport domain was designed by mapping real-world description of an object into image description. This paper showed ontology approach could be used to design the formal representation of land cover by mapping real-world description of an object into image description. Ontology itself would be used for image identification/classification/clustering at airport domain or other image domains. © 2017 IEEE.","airport; land cover; Land Cover Classification SNI 7645 National Standardization Body; ontology","Airport security; Airports; Image analysis; Image understanding; Information management; Ontology; Standardization; Airport domains; Color and textures; Formal representations; Image descriptions; Image identification; Land cover; Land cover classification; Real-world descriptions; Mapping",,,,,,,"Hao, F., Guoping, Q., Integrating low-level and semantic features ror object consistent segmentation (2013) Neourocomputing, 119, pp. 74-81; Russakovsky, O., Jia, D., Hao, S., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Li, F.F., ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge (2015) International Journal Computer Vision, 115 (3), pp. 211-252; Andres, S., Arvor, D., Pierkot, C., The towards an ontological approach for classifying remote sensing images (2012) Proceeding of 8th International Conference on Signal Image Technology & Internet Based Systems (SITIS), pp. 825-832; Li, D., Sui, H., Shan, J., Discussion. on key technologies of geogrpahic national condition monitoring (2012) Geomat Information Science.

Medical image data is formed by pixels that correspond to a part of a physical object and produced by imaging modalities. Exploration of medical image data methods is a challenge in the sense of getting their insight value, analyzing and diagnosing of a specific disease. Image classification plays an important role in computer-aided-diagnosis and is a big challenge on image analysis tasks. This challenge related to the usage of methods and techniques in exploiting image processing result, pattern recognition result and classification methods and subsequently validating the image classification result into medical expert knowledge. The main objective of medical images classification is not only to reach high accuracy but also to identify which parts of human body are infected by the disease. This paper reviewed the state-of-the-art of image classification techniques to diagnose human body disease. The review covered identification of medical image classification techniques, image modalities used, the dataset and trade off for each technique. At the end, the reviews showed the improvement of image classification techniques such as to increase accuracy and sensitivity value and to be feasible employed for computer-aided-diagnosis are a big challenge and an open research. © 2016 IEEE.","disease diagnosis; image classification; medical informatics","Classification (of information); Computer aided analysis; Computer aided diagnosis; Diagnosis; Economic and social effects; Image analysis; Image processing; Information management; Medical imaging; Pattern recognition; Classification methods; Classification results; Classification technique; Disease diagnosis; Images classification; Medical informatics; Sensitivity values; State of the art; Image classification",,,,,,,"Procter, R., (2016) Definition of Health Informatics, , https//www.nlm.nih.gov/hsrinfo/informatics.html, Aug. 01,[Aug. 03, 2016]; Bui, A.A.T., Taira, R.K., Kangarloo, H., Introduction (2010) Medical Imaging Informatics, pp. 3-14. , New York: Springer; Roque, F.S., Jensen, P.B., Schmock, H., Dalgaard, M., Andreatta, M., Hansen, T., Søeby, K., Jensen, L.J., Using electronic patient records to discover disease correlations and stratify patient cohorts (2011) PLOS Computational Technology, 7 (8), pp. 1-10; Qiu, Y., Zhen, S., Zhou, M., Li, L., Continuously improve the medical care quality and hospital management level through medical information system construction (2012) Journal of Translational Medicine, 10, p.

The aim of this research is to design a data mining model for credit scoring in bank in order to support and improve the performance of the credit analyst job. The proposed model applies classification using Naïve Bayes and ID3 algorithm. The accuracy of Naïve Bayes classifier is 82% and ID3 is 76%.

This is because to simplify the decision-making process, one of which is the determination of prospective credit customers at Bank ABC. Bank ABC is one of the financial institutions in the growth phase needed to improve the quality of safe, high-quality and accurate credit. The purpose of this study is to accelerate the decision making process of credit customers, namely whether credit is accepted or rejected. One method used is CRISP-DM as standart processes for data mining. Election algorithm using the C4.5 decision tree algorithm. The final result of this study is the prediction of the pattern of credit results for credit customers. This pattern is generated from decision tree is expexted to be a reference for credit customer take a credit at Bank ABC. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

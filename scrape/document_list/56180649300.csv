One of the important things is right decision in issues of supplier selection. The improper supplier affects consequence negatively to the quality of company's business process. Thus, the right way to answer the issues is incredibly crucial to be proposed. This study aims to design an application to determine the sub-criteria weight with Fuzzy-AHP method, select the best supplier via Fuzzy-TOPSIS method, and calculate the allocation of quota to each supplier thru Fuzzy-MOLP method. The study was conducted on high class store by taking the object of material gymnastic product (spandex). Simulation confidently demonstrates that the Fuzzy-AHP approach is able to be operated to generate parameter Quality Product as the best sub-criteria (with value 0.221), the Fuzzy-TOPSIS technique can be used to ring out the supplier (where CV. Maju Jaya Abadi as the best supplier), and the method Fuzzy-MOLP is exploited to calculate the allocation of quota (where CV.

Optimum cost for running this industry is a necessity so that power generated can be produce according to power demand with appropriate cost. Economic dispatch is an optimization approach in power system plant with objective function is to minimize cost by finding appropriate arrangement of generator output according electric requirement and capacity of the system. Previous researches have been proposed techniques to solve this problem, however a stable convergence and good computational efficiency is still required. Therefore, this paper proposes bat algorithm to minimize total generator cost from thermal power plant. Bat algorithm is one of nature inspired optimization problem which has advantage in stable convergence. The experiment results show that Bat algorithm is able to save approximately 1.23% compare to the actual cost and 0.12% to firefly algorithm. © 2018 The Authors.

In the operating of electric power system, an economic planning problem is one of variables that its must be considered since economically planning will give more efficiency in operational cost. In this paper the economic dispatch problem which has non linear cost function solved by using swarm intelligent method is Gaussian Particle Swarm Optimization (GPSO) and Lagrange Multiplier. GPSO is a population-based stochastic algorithms which their moving inspired by swarm intelligent and probabilities theories. To analize its accuracy, the economic dispatch solution by GPSO method will be compared with Lagrange multiplier method. From the running test result the GPSO method give economically planning calculation which it better than Lagrange multiplier method and the GPSO method faster to getting error convergence. Therefore the GPSO method have better performance to getting global best solution than the Lagrange method. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,,"Aziz, M.A., Musirin, J.I., Rahman, K.A., (2006) First Int.

This is because all have been connected to the internet network, and this system is expected to reduce many of the problems in the developing cities or developed cities. With an excellent precautionary method will lead to an orderly community system that passes traffic, can be monitored regarding vehicles, highways and traffic signs. Moreover, with intelligent monitoring, many help the government and officers work, with proper tracking the community can measure the distance traveled so that they can arrive quickly at the destination, and reduce accident in the road.

All ideas from the development of intelligent transportation to a town that wants to build and want to change into a smart city, especially in the field of ACP (system created, computing developed), based on parallel management and control system (PTMS). PTMS is considered to be enlarged to a new generation of an intelligent transportation system, and its essential component of architecture then make the hardware and software that will support a new architecture in a developing city to a smart city. The case in a lift is a communication system on a car that uses peer to peer networks and smart cards, with a communication system in a vehicle is expected to control congestion in a developing city through an original town with a connected system. This paper proposed four aspects of surveillance such as Traffic surveillance, vehicle Surveillance, passenger surveillance and driver surveillance. The combination of these surveillances will create best applied Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) or can be called as Smart Transportation Systems(STS). © 2018 IEEE.","Intelligent Transportation Systems;

With gamification, a lot of people help people learn something natural, and gamification is usually inspired by everyday life, for example, the game The Sims, which combines daily life with a game in sports is one of the best examples of gamification implementation. Using gamification in a game makes learning more enjoyable than learning with truth, and without realizing it they have done learning. In this paper we proposed a gamification architecture for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) which include logic game such as brain, think, body, move, sport and logic. Moreover, there are five methods proposed for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) such as object game, content, and player, design, and framework, deploy and play, and finish structure. © 2018 IEEE.","ADHD games;

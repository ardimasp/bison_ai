The fast development of fintech startups on creating payment gateway and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending applications is one of examples for the modern disruptive innovations affecting to traditional financial business. The problem arises when the digital disruption affects the bank's business models due to change in customer trends with additional impacts to conventional companies. This paper presents the quantitative approaches like statistical hypothesis testing and analysis of regression using convenient random sampling for better analyzing the impacts of fintech on conventional banking industry in Indonesia. A number of important and realistic variables, such as customer satisfaction, net promotion score, promotion, ease of use, etc., were considered in this research in order to find a variety of the value propositions that dominantly influence to the adoption of fintech or banking products. The results show that the banks have been disrupted by the payment fintech since the emergence of fintech companies in around 2015, mainly due to superior value propositions, like promotion with standardized beta value of 0.349 and wide range of merchants with 0.153, respectively. In addition, the fintech startups have digital strategies on adopting a customer-centric mindset and developing a product that gives their customer a high customer satisfaction. However, in the current time, P2P fintechs do not have that significant disruption to the banks, mainly due to the fact that the customers consider more on safety reasons. © 2019 IEEE.","analysis of regression; customer satisfaction; digital disruption; net promoter score; payment gateway; peer-to-peer","Information management; Peer to peer networks; Sales; Sampling; Testing; analysis of regression; digital disruption; net promoter score; Payment gateways; Peer to peer; Customer satisfaction",,,,,"Gomber, P., Kauffman, R.J., Parker, C., Weber, B.W., On the fintech revolution: Interpreting the forces of innovation, disruption, and transformation in financial services (2018) Journal of Management Information Systems, 35, pp. 220-265; Demyanyk, Y., Kolliner, D., Peer-to-peer lending is poised to grow (2014) Economic Trends; Paulus, Y.E., The emergence of peer-to-peer lending in Indonesia: A study of risk management analysis on conventional banking companies (2018) International Journal of Management and Applied Science (IJMAS), 4, pp. 34-40; Bunea, S., Kogan, B., Stolin, D., Banks vs fintech: At last, it's official' (2016) Journal of Financial Transformation, 44, pp. 122-131; Temelkov, Z., Fintech firms opportunity or threat for banks?

Jakarta has 445 RWs which are categorized as unfit for habitation, one of which is the Penjaringan sub-district, and the government will organize it. The purpose of this study is to determine the physical condition of the settlement environment in Penjaringan and the design solutions needed. The method used in this study is descriptive-qualitative method. The results of the study show that the Penjaringan area requires redevelopment in a portion of the planning area using 8 design criteria, namely land use, architectural character, landscaping, circulation and parking, property maintenance, signage, site furnishings, and lighting and utilities. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","livable settlements; physical condition; redevelopment","Population statistics; Design criteria; Design solutions; Human settlements; livable settlements; Physical conditions; Population growth; Qualitative method; redevelopment; Land use",,,,,"UU Nomor 1 Tahun 2011 Permukiman Kumuh; Peraturan Menteri Negara Perumahan Rakyat Republik Indonesia No. 22/PERMEN/M/2008; Commercial Corridor Urban Design Guide - Redevelopment Design Concepts & Guidelines, , Anonim; Hariyanto, A., (2007) Strategi Penanganan Kawasan Kumuh Sebagai Upaya Menciptakan Lingkungan Perumahan Dan Permukiman Yang Sehat; Prayitno, B., (2014) Skema Inovatif: Penanganan Permukiman Kumuh; Nurdiani, N., Adjustment and self-help approach for improving housing unit quality in multi-storey housing (2012) Applied Mechanics and Materials, 174-177, pp. 3463-3466","Nurdiani, N.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: nnurdiani@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

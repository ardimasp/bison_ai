At present, the Indonesian tax directorate general has implemented an E-billing system that can be used by the public to make tax payments online. E-billing is available in the form of web-based and mobile applications in order to facilitate the public in making payments. However, in reality, there are still many people who prefer to use traditional methods of paying taxes. Initial allegations, these problems relate to web design factors, design applications, and website quality from the E-billing system. This paper examines the factors that relate to people's satisfaction with the decision to use the E-billing system. © 2018 IEEE.","application design; e-billing; satisfaction; service quality; web design","Citrus fruits; Quality of service; Web Design; Application design; Billing systems; Design applications; Digital technologies; Mobile applications; satisfaction; Service Quality; Website quality; Websites",,,,,"Carter, L., Belanger, F., Citizen adoption of electronic government initiatives (2004) System Sciences, 2004.

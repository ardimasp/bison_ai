This device will be mounted in many high rise building that can be found mainly in big city like Jakarta. The device will record information on earthquake s magnitude in the building which is taken by using accelerometer; later on the data will be compared with the real earthquake s magnitude that is taken using seismograph. Data on device position, time, and magnitude level will be sent through Short Message Services (SMS) via Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) networks to server. The result showed that the accuracy is 95% compared to the commercial seismograph measurement. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Accelerometer; AVR; Earthquake; GSM; Microcontroller; Seismic intensity meter",,,,,,"Indonesia: A Necklace of Equatorial Emeralds, , http://www.indo.com/indonesia/archipelago.html, Anonymous, retrieved on May 1st 2012, from Bali; Subarya, C., Chlieh, M., Prawirodirdjo, L., Avouac, J.P., Bock, Y., Sieh, K., Meltzner, A.J., McCaffrey, R., Plate-boundary deformation associated with the great sumatera-andaman earthquake (2006) Nature, 440, pp. 46-51; Sekizawa, A., Simultaneous Post-earthquake Fires and the Role of Firefighting Activiy for Mitigating the Damage, , http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Xh2bvFZv8EoJ: management.kochitech.ac.jp/PDF/IWPM/IWPM_Sekizawa.pdf+&hl=en, retrieved on 10th August 2012, from; Gibson, G., An introduction to seismology (1997) Disaster Prevention and Management, 6 (5), pp. 356-361; Evans, J.R., The Sidebar Computer Program: A Seismic-Shaking Intensity Meter, , http://geopubs.wr.usgs.gov/open-file/of03-202/, retrieved on 10th August 2012, from U.S. Geological Survey, Open-File Report 03-202; Hosokawa, M., Byeong-Pyo, J., Takizawa, O., Earthquake intensity estimation and damage detection using remote sensing data for global rescue operations (2009) Proceeding of IEEE International Geosciences and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2, pp. II420-II423; Lele, M.A., Gu, J., Evaluation of solid state accelerometer sensor for effective position estimation (2011) Proceeding of 9th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation (WCICA), pp. 959-964; Takahashi, H., Asakawa, E., Kawai, Y., Ogasawara, Y., Saeki, T., Study on accelerometers in reflection seismic surveys (2007) Proceeding of Symposium on Underwater Technology and Workshop on Scientific Use of Submarine Cables and Related Technologies, pp. 420-426; Yongzheng, Z., Yingsha, X., The design and implementation of embedded system (2011) Proceeding of 3rd International Conference on Computer Research and Development (ICCRD), 2, pp. 423-426; TDL-303/303C/303S/303CS Digital Portable Seismographs, , http://www.taide.com/old/productHTM/TDL.htm, Anonymous, retrieved on March 30th 2011, from TDL series Digital Portable Seismographs(TDL-203/303/303C/303S/303CS/303Q Types); Algermissen, S.T., Steinbrugge, K.V., Seismic hazard and risk assessment: Some case study (1984) Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance, 9 (1), pp. 8-26; Gupta, H.K., Rao, N.P., Rastogi, B.K., Sarkar, D., The deadliest intraplate earthquake (2001) Science, 291 (5511), pp. 2101-2102; Li, L.T., Min, W.Y., Magnitude estimation using the covered areas of strong ground motion in earthquake early warning (2010) Geophysical Research Letters, 37 (9), pp. L09301-L09305; Porro, B., Natural disaster insurance, problems of capacity and solvency (1984) Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance, 9 (2), pp. 158-166; King, S.A., Kiremidjian, A.S., (1996) Shake, Rattle and Map, Civil Engineering, 66 (6), pp. 50-52","Sutanto, A.T.; Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysic, Jl Angkasa 1No. 2 Central, Jakarta, Indonesia; email: steff@binus.edu",,,,"2012 International Conference on Advances Science and Contemporary Engineering, ICASCE 2012","24 October 2012 through 25 October 2012","Jakarta",,18777058,,,,"English","Procedia Eng.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891765945

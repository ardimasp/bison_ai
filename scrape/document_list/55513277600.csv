Sarcasm or verbal irony is a linguistic phenomenon where the wording of a speaker signifies the opposite of the literal meaning of what they are saying. On social media, Indonesians tend to use sarcastic remarks to criticize something and this behavior can pose a problem when a sentiment analysis is performed where the analysis yields false-positive results. To solve this potential problem, the detection of sarcasm is necessary. A convolutional neural network model is used in this paper to handle the automated identification of sarcasm in Indonesian. Although it is mainly used in computer vision, this model has shown promising results on specific kinds of sentiment analysis and classification problems compared to other neural network models. Using this model can increase detection accuracy compared to discrete models. There have been many studies conducted on sarcasm detection, although the majority is in English. Other languages such as Indonesian are slow in improvement compared to English. This fact can be seen by the lack of publications on Indonesian sarcasm detection studies. This study is conducted to contribute to other Indonesian sarcasm detection studies. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The problem that is often experienced is the lack of management of the amount of bandwidth needed so that there is often a shortage or excess of bandwidth allocation at each BTS site so that this problem can reduce the profits obtained by the company. From these problems, we need a system that can regulate and predict future bandwidth requirements. In this study, bandwidth requirements will be simulated using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average method, the ARIMA method using time series data from November 2019 to January 2020. After trying out several ARIMA models (1.0.0), (1.1.0), (1.0.1), (0.0.1) and (0.0.6), it was found that the ARIMA Model (0.0.6) has the best level of accuracy with an RMSE value of 419,139. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

We always look for all the latest information through books or news. News usually contains tags or categories to make it easier to find similar news. It can be done manually by a human or with a machine to make it easier. Data mining techniques such as clustering and classification can be used to help the categorization process. Clustering is a technique that can be used to grouped news based on their similarity. There is some algorithm that can be used to clustering data. One of them is Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). ACO is a metaheuristic algorithm that mimics how ants bring food to the colony. ACO also can be used to solve the clustering problem. In this paper, we will use the ACO version for clustering to cluster news and find the performance of the said method.

API Gateway can help to solve complexity problems with n-to-n integration, where n is the number of integrated applications. Implement Service Oriented Modeling and Architecture (SOMA) methodology as a guide in implementing SOA-based solutions. SOMA has seven parts, namely Business Modeling and Transformation, Solution Management, Identification, Specification, Realization, Implementation and Deployment, Monitoring and Management. API Latency Test Tools as a tool to measure the performance of each service connected to the B2C Ditoko.com web application. Data is analyzed by comparing service usage with the concept of API Gateway and n-to-n service integration where n is the number of integrated applications. The results obtained indicate that using the API-based SOA architecture has a lower time to access each services/pages than using a service with n-to-n integration (monolithic architecture).

However, high and redundant computation is needed to select the proper cluster for each object, especially when the data dimensionality is high, such as social media comments. Reducing the redundant computation may cut the execution time, but it can potentially decrease the quality of clustering. With the basic idea that nearby objects tend to be in the same cluster, the nearest neighbors method can be used to choose the appropriate cluster for some objects efficiently by considering their neighbor’s cluster. Therefore, this paper proposes the combination of nearest neighbors and ant colony optimization for clustering (NNACOC) which can reduce the computation time but is still able to retain the quality of clustering. To evaluate its performance, NNACOC was tested using some benchmark datasets and twitter comments. Most of the experiments show that NNACOC outperformed the original ant colony optimization for clustering (ACOC) in quality and execution time. NNACOC also yielded a better result than k-means when clustering the twitter comments. © 2020 Slovene Society Informatika.

Student graduation rate from 2011-2018 seen from the number of incoming students has decreased. These conditions become reference material for the majors to conduct evaluations and strategic steps in an effort to increase the level of graduation of students so that quality objectives can be achieved. Evaluation of majors needs to be improved by analyzing the factors that cause late graduation for a student. 3. For the purposes of training data Student data is used from 2011 2015, while for testing data Student data is used for 2016. The method used to predict is the Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System method. Based on the test results, training is conducted on the amount of training data as much as 50%, 60% and 70% of the total data available. While testing is conducted on the remaining training data consisting of percentages of 50%, 40% and 30%. For each data combination ten times (Epoch value) and then the average RMSE value is taken from the test. The smallest RMSE value was found in a combination of 60% training data and 40% test data which was 0.006380. The more training data shows the higher the level of accuracy. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

With the help of user telemetry in game development, it can provide access to data on user behavior from installed game clients' platform such as Steam. These behavioral data can be used to find out the Steam user behavioral patterns on playtime distributions that can be studied by developers in order to have a deeper understanding of the behaviors of their players. In this study, the data are clustered using the k-prototypes algorithm, a combination of k-means and k-modes algorithm that can be used to cluster mixed attributes.

With the high number of non-performing loans, the assessment of potential new customers in financial companies has become a major focus of the financial industry. High accuracy credit scoring system can give better predictions on new customers and can change the company's economic growth and for better capital. This study will use a real world dataset, where data is obtained directly from a financial company and will be used to feed an Artificial Neural Network to differentiate between good and bad potential new customers. In this research, the Artificial Neural Network will be created, and then will be applied with the ensemble method. The idea of applying the parallel is to test whether it can increase accuracy or not. Finally, the output accuracy from the final class of the ensemble methods that resulted from the voting will be compared with the original unmodified single model and it shows that the modified multiple model surpasses the unmodified single model in terms of accuracy with a tradeoff on duration in the process. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Moreover, traffic accident information from social media such as Twitter is easy to obtain when compared to other data source from police or government institutions. In this work, we tried to create a traffic accident dataset. We crawling on Twitter, then do a text processing which involves case folding, filtering, stemming, tokenizing, and stop word removal. To find out whether the tweet is true about accident information, then we do a word embedding using FastText method and classification with SVM, KNN, and Naïve Bayes algorithms then testing the accuracy of models using K-fold validation method. The results show that the best accuracy of the model is up to 85% with SVM method. This model is then applied to a tweet dataset containing 142,168 tweets taken through the crawling process since April 2019 and can be used for further research on https://www.dodyagung.com/dataset/accident. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

It provides a comprehensive completion approach and gives total confidence to asset owner to operate the facility handed over by construction contractors. While the nature variation of asset hierarchy is unique from one type of asset to another, a project completion software must have prominent ability to adapt wide range of variations with unlimited level of hierarchy. One of the approaches to overcome this is implementing a tree-model concept to accommodate flexible hierarchy. Unfortunately, the package is loaded with complexity to retrieve data and takes longer join operation. This paper proposes a business intelligence approach to analyze and make an optimum reporting retrieval using data warehouse. This is implemented in 4 steps following Kimball methods. The objective of this paper is to generate model by using data warehouse starting the extract, transform and load process on the flexible tree model hierarchy. It can be used to generate report and comprehensive dashboard especially progress report of project and work schedule as needed in the oil and gas and construction industry. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

They are expected to be having a character, skilful, expert and competent in their study. To accomplish that, the student attendance system are quite strict. Students will get fine for their late or absence at the end of the semester. The problem is the system is still manually managed. It is hard for the student to know their absence status, how much fine that they must pay in real time. The head of study program and head of study majors are also hard to track the problematic student which has a lot of absence attendance. To answer their problem, we proposed the solution using data warehouse development which was first proposed by Kimball for student absence attendance fine at University ABC. This data is analysed using OLAPto provide data visual such as dashboard or report. With this solution, University ABC can process and present the report of Student Absence and Attendance Fine relatively faster. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

With the help of user telemetry in game development, it can provide access to data on user behavior from installed game clients platform such as Steam. These behavioral data can be used to find out the Steam user behavioral patterns on playtime distributions that can be studied by developers in order to have a deeper understanding of the behaviors of their players. In this study, the data are clustered using the k-prototypes algorithm, a combination of k-means and k-modes algorithm that can be used to cluster mixed attributes. The result shows that the clusters represent the types and preferences of the players. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Clustering is a technique that can be used to grouped news based on their similarity. There is some algorithm that can be used to clustering data. One of it is Ant Colony optimization (ACO). ACO is a metaheuristic algorithm that mimics how ants brings food to the colony. ACO also can be used to solve clustering problem.

This study tries to use the information public from social media tweeter. Social media is considered as public information which every people can be involved. This system, starts collecting tweets which mention formal tweeter media. The application will group each tweets into various themes based on the cosine similarity. If cosine similarity is big, it can be indicated as one group news.. The tweets which are more than the certain threshold, it can be indicated as the candidate news. This candidate news is then classified into one of ten categories using support vector machine (SVM). This classification has 85% accuracy. The category classified is used for assigning the specific journalist to cover this candidate news. This system has two important modules. One in center server which is responsible for collecting and processing data, the other one application mobile which is installed in journalist is called Journes.

Each of them is unique in every school and cannot be generalized although using the same curriculum. School personnel such as headmaster, teacher, and staff also not only assigned to one school location and can have multiple roles in each school location. With that complexity, a single query is not fast enough to generate a scoring report. This paper proposed the system business intelligence which can analyze the progress of student learning. This paper used nine steps to design a data warehouse as a tool business intelligence. The On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP) is used to analyze the data and visualize them using dashboard. By using data warehouse, each school can answer business question relation to scoring and visualize them in a dashboard to make a decision. © 2019 IEEE.","Business Intelligence; Data Warehouse; Report; Scoring; Socrates System School","Curricula; Data warehouses; Education management; On-line analytical processing; School location; Student learning; Information analysis",,,,,,"Tarnaveanu, D., Pentaho business analytics: A business intelligence open source alternative (2012) ERP and E-Business Application Deployment in Open Source Distributed Cloud Systems; He, Y., Lee, R., Huai, Y., Shao, Z., Jain, N., Zhang, X., Xu, Z., Rcfile: A fast and space-efficient data placement structure in mapreduce-based warehouse systems (2011) Data Engineering (ICDE), 27th International Conference on, pp. 1199-1208; Tuncer, O., Van Den Berg, J., (2010) Implementing BI concepts with Pentaho, an evaluation, , Delft University of Technology.

To appeal to their current and potential customers, a company must understand the market interests. Companies can segment their customers by using surveys and telemetry data to get to know the customer’s interests. One way of segmenting the customer is by grouping or clustering them according to their interests and behaviors. In this study, the k-prototypes clustering algorithm, which is an improved combination of k-means and k-modes algorithm, will be used to cluster a behavioral data that contains both numerical and categorical attribute, obtained from a survey conducted on teenagers into clusters of 4, 5, and 6. Each cluster will contain teenagers with certain behavior different from other clusters. And then by analyzing the results, advertisers will be able to define a profile that indicates their interests regarding the internet, social media and text messaging, effectively revealing the kind of ad that would be relatable for them. © BEIESP.","Behavioral data; Cluster Analysis; Interest; K-Prototypes",,,,,,,"Lenhart, A., Mobile access shifts social media use and other online activities (2015) Teens, Social Media & Technology Overview, , http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/09/mobile-access-shifts-social-media-use-and-other-online-activities/; Wright, E., Khanfar, N.M., Harrington, C., Kizer, L.E., The Lasting Effects Of Social Media Trends On Advertising (2016) J.

GIS Bookstore is one company that needs data every month to be analyzed. However, GIS Bookstore has constraints in processing large data with increasing time. for example GIS bookstore has problems in analyzing bestsellers because of the increasing number of authors and book publishers who work together. In this study, GIS Bookstore found a solution by implementing business intelligence that plays a role in the processing of raw data in large amounts of data into well-structured data information, the results are collected and processed in a data warehouse scheme. Targets stored in the data warehouse are data that will be processed based on the model design method (ERD) and star schema.

Until now the problem of congestion has not been resolved properly because the number of vehicles is always increase and the number of roads is inadequate, drivers are not getting complete and updated information about the traffic around them, other than that the parties are also less responsive in handling congestion. Therefore, this study was made to analyze and determine which road segments need special attention, help traffic management, make it easier for users to find out the latest traffic information, and make relevant parties able to take quick response actions. This paper is using social media data, social network such as Facebook is able to provide a real-time data. this data can be processed to gain a powerful insight. However, processing social media data have challenge due to the raw text format, therefore the text processing needs to be done in order to make the data readable. In Jakarta, there is an official account which post a traffic condition in Jakarta. In this paper we are getting the post data from this account, do text processing on it and make a reports and dashboard to provide any user insight regarding the traffic data in Jakarta. © 2019 IEEE.","congestion; dashboard; real time; report; social media; text processing","Data handling; Road vehicles; Social networking (online); Text processing; congestion; dashboard; Real time; report; Social media; Traffic congestion",,,,,,"McIntee, J., How to beat the burn-out (1984) Health Soc.

Therefore, in order to help the company to learn the result of the project budgets that have already been spent for the various needs of project construction, the technology of data warehouse should be present in order to extract and record data more consistently and time-saving. Data warehouse technology to support the development of Data Warehouse is Pentaho because Pentaho is database application that is supported with database MYSQL and OLAP feature as a means to analyze and process data contained in multidimensional tables once the process of ETL is executed. ETL means the process of selecting and extracting data from one source into the designated source in order to produce better-quality data result. OLAP is developed by using pivot 4j view integrated by pentaho server to map the structure of fact and dimension table properly so that, the tables can get a proper connection to display desired information in term of graphs for the need of dashboard display. The dashboard that is coded through mdx queries in CDE Dashboard shows the final result of either monthly or yearly project budget obviously and reliably so that the company can learn the report and make decision that needs to be taken to control the budget costs and maintain the company profit. Both CDE Dashboard and pivot 4j view are integrated with pentaho server. Finally, report is presented by using pentaho report designer as a means to extract needed data more rapidly and consistently because data are called through id stored in different table, but the same field. © BEIESP.","Data warehouse; MYSQL; Pentaho; Realization of project budget CDE dashboard",,,,,,,"Alvi, I.A., (2018) Modeling Your Dimensional Data Warehouse: Star Schema Vs.

Each year, e-commerce business increasingly popular. Some retail companies finally decided to focus on internet-based sales to get more customers. Along with transactions that continue to be carried out from year to year, transaction data continues to be stored and stacked and of course space consuming. So after years, Business Intelligence is finally appeared and offer great data processing. Without a business intelligence, these stacked big data are useless and wait to be removed because of poor knowledge. Business intelligence turns on the poor knowledge data into rich knowledge data visualization. This paper proposed a data warehouse that can be used to build a business intelligent with utilize information obtained from the history of transactions. To build up this business intelligent, authors uses methodology steps by Kimball which consists 4 steps of dimensional design process.

There are many table to be processed for the data, because of that it's hard to show the report quickly. PT XYZ needs fast and reliable report to be shown, especially for control or audit. The suggested solution is to use data warehouse, because it has more structured storage and the data can be analysed by OLAP analysis that has the capability to show the data quickly.

If marketing performance is good, then the company will also develop well. But in today's conditions, we often find that marketing motivation is often overlooked or not too cared for. So that performance decreases and will be very detrimental to the company. However, marketing motivation needs to be improved by determining the top marketers through a bonus system. Where the use of data warehouse will be carried out as the best Decision Support System (DSS) for manager in determining the top marketers. With the use of data warehouses, large amounts of data can be prayed in such a way as to produce information that is useful for managers in decision making. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

These criteria and dimenssions are evaluated by some experts using analitycal hierarchy process (AHP) to assess priorities for elearning system. There are four dimensions, system quality (four criteria), learning information quality (three criteria), service quality (three criteria) and service support (three criteria) dimension. This system is also evaluated by filling out the questionnaire by students as user of elearning system using regression method. The attributes are used as independent variable, while the succesfull of elearning is dependent variable. The result of using AHP and regression system has a different.

It is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that has useful real-world applications. In this problem, finding a useful algorithm to handle the massive amounts of jobs required to retrieve an actionable permutation order in a reasonable amount of time is important. The recently developed crow search algorithm (CSA) is a novel swarm-based metaheuristic algorithm originally proposed to solve mathematical optimization problems. In this paper, a hybrid CSA (HCSA) is proposed to minimize the makespans of PFSPs. First, to make the CSA suitable for solving the PFSP, the smallest position value rule is applied to convert continuous numbers into job sequences. Then, the HCSA uses a Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) technique to create a population with the required levels of quality and diversity. We apply a local search to enhance the quality of the solutions and avoid premature convergence; simulated annealing enhances the local search of a method based on a variable neighborhood search. Computational tests are used to evaluate the algorithm using PFSP benchmarks with job sizes between 20 and 500. The tests indicate that the performance of the proposed HCSA is significantly superior to that of other algorithms. © 2019 by the authors.","Crow search algorithm; Makespan; NEH heuristic; Permutation flow shop scheduling; Smallest position value",,,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST

Many systems that have been connected to this system has complexity of integration. SOA using enterprise service bus (ESB) is one way to manage the integration of information systems. ESB is a software infrastructure that can solve complexity problems with n-to-n integration, where n is the number of integrated applications. The business case has been implemented each function of services and ESB. The results obtained show that each services and ESB has its own strengths and weakness. As regards strengths, it should be noted that ESB copes very well with both kinds of files and small and large size but put the effort if the application of ESB is not working well it can be affected to another application system. N-to-n integration performs as good enough with small files and size but need to manage if there were any add or updated with the service. This research implemented SOA using ESB to proves to be a good choice for integration solution in a business environment with a large number of users and diversified communications. © IAEME Publication.","Airline; Enterprise Service Bus; Integration; Performance; SOA",,,,,,,"Ueasangkomsate, P., (2015) Adoption E-Commerce for Export Market of Small and Medium Enterprises in Thailand; Arridha, R.R., Mohamed, H., Elias, N.F., The determinants of airline online services satisfaction: A conceptual model (2014) International Conference on Computer and Information Sciences (ICCOINS), , Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Mouakket, S., Investigating the motives of customers’ continuance intentions towards online reservation: The role of e-service quality (2014) Journal of Organizational and End User Computing, 26 (2), pp. 18-40; Vilkaite-Vaitone, N., Papsiene, P., Influence of customer loyalty program on organizational performance: A case of airline industry (2016) Economics, 27 (1), pp. 109-116. , March; Uddin, N., Leon, S., Airline ancillary services: An investigation into passenger purchase behavior (2017) The Transportation Research Forum, 56; Kaewrattanapat, N., Nookhong, J., (2017) Recruitment Agency Based on SOA and XML, 8; Kavitha, V., Shanmugapriya, D.P., Dhayalan, D.V., Business Process Management system using SOA (2017) Advances in Computational Sciences and Technology, 10, pp. 1457-1462; Chang, T.-K., Hwang, E.T.Y., An SOA-based system modeling methodology (2015) Journal of Internet Technology, 16, pp. 547-561. , 15 May; Górski, T., Pietrasik, K., Performance analysis of Enterprise Service Buses (2017) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Computer Science, 10, pp. 16-32; RajKumar, N., Vinod, V., Integrated Educational Information Systems for Disabled Schools via a Service Bus using SOA (2015) Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 8 (13). , July; Sri, S.A., Priyadarsini, R., Digital campus information system based on SOA using aspect oriented software development (2015) International Journal of Technology and Engineering System, 7 (2), pp. 130-133; You, Y., Xu, Y., Wang, L., Car service spare parts procurement process improvements based on SOA (2016) Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 3 (3), pp. 554-563. , September; Wei, N., Research on an information application integration platform based on SOA and web service (2015) International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering, 10, pp. 165-174; Ma, X., Yao, Q.-B., Shan, S., The study and application of system integration based on ESB for enterprise group (2017) International Conference on Wireless Communication and Network Engineering (WCNE 2017), , Xiamen, Chia",,,,"IAEME Publication",,,,,09766308,,,,"English","Int.J.

This study will utilize data warehouse and business intelligence for PT ABC's marketing and sales strategy, e.g. to improve its service to customers, to increase number of active users and the duration of streaming per user. OLTP data suggested for the data warehouse is the existing streaming transactions, which will be used to analyze customers' most preferred songs. The proposed method to design the data warehouse is using 9-steps from Kimball. The selected process for the data warehouse is customers' streaming and downloading process, with dimensions of location, time and song, with fact less table of the streaming itself.

Deep learning model that is most often used for time series prediction is LSTM. LSTM is widely used because of its excellence in remembering very long sequences. However, doing training on models that use LSTM requires a long time. Trying from one model to another model that use LSTM will take a very long time, thus a method is needed for optimizing hyperparameter to get a model with a small RMSE. This research proposed Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) as a method in optimizing hyperparameter for models that use LSTM. ABC is a metaheuristic method that mimics the behavior of bee colonies in foraging. Optimized hyperparameter in this research consisted of sliding window size, number of LSTM units, dropout rate, regularizer, regularizer rate, optimizer and learning rate. In this research the proposed method called as ABC-LSTM. Bitcoin prices historical data was used as the dataset for evaluating the prediction of the models. The best ABC-LSTM model resulted best RMSE of 189.61 compared to model that use LSTM without optimization resulted best RMSE of 236.17. This result showed that ABC-LSTM model outperformed models that use LSTM without optimization. © 2019 ASTES Publishers.

There are many messages that can be found in social media that need to be noticed so the messages from the user could reach the viewer. Social media provides promising as well as challenging data to business intelligence. By using data warehouse and business intelligence, the data from social media can be proceeded to monitor and understand adoption and sentiment. In this research, data warehouse and business intelligence will be designed and implemented using data from social medias; Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Youtube which are expected to be the source to do monitoring to social media contents that are shared by each stakeholder from the talk shows that are going to be analyzed. As for the sentiment analysis, word2vec, Naïve Bayes and Random Forest will be applied for the qualification methods. As a result, this monitoring is used to give understanding of how information spread and the sentiment which underlies the spreading messages could give critical perception to the management on how their product recognized and valued in society. © 2019 Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems.All right reserved.","Business Intelligence; Data Warehouse; Naïve Bayes; Random Forest; Sentiment Analysis; Word2vec",,,,,,,"Indonesia, K.P., (2016) Survei Indeks Kualitas Program Siaran Televisi Periode 5 Tahun 2016; Timberg, B.M., (2002) Television Talk: A History of the Tv Talk Show, , The University Of Texas Press; Abdallah, A., Rana, N.P., Dwivedi, Y.K., Algharabat, R., Social media in marketing: A review and analysis of the existing literature (2017) Telemat.

On the other hand, automatic text summarization is considered as a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) problem for satisfying two conflicting objectives. Retaining the information from the source of text as much as possible and producing the summary length as short as possible. To solve that problem, an undirected graph is created to construct the relation between social media comments. Then, the Multi-Objective Ant Colony Optimization (MOACO) algorithm is applied to generate summaries by selecting concise and important comments from the graph based on the desired summary size. The quality of generated summaries is compared to other text summarization algorithms such as TextRank, LexRank, SumBasic, Latent Semantic Analysis, and KL-Sum. The result showed that MOACO can produce informative and concise summaries which have small cosine distance to the source text and fewer number of words compared to the other algorithms. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.","Ant colony optimization;

The objective of this study was to develop a model for automatic classification of musical genres from audio data by using features from low-level time and frequency domains. These features can highlight the differences between different genres. In the model, feature selection is performed using a genetic algorithm (GA), and the resulting dataset is classified using the k-nearest neighbor (KNN), naive Bayes classifier (NBC), and support vector machine (SVM) learning methods. Tenfold cross-validation is used to obtain the optimal f-measure value. In this study, the data were obtained from the GTZAN genre collection datasets. In the performance evaluation, it was found that the GA-based feature selection strategy can improve the F-measure rate from 5% to 20% for the KNN, NBC, and SVM-based algorithms. In addition, the proposed SVM-GA algorithm can exactly better than other comparison algorithms. © 2019 ASTES Publishers.

The cluster problem has been proved to be an NP-hard problem. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm based on Whole optimization algorithm (WOA) and Crow search algorithm (CSA) is proposed, namely HWCA. The HWCA algorithm has the advantages of the search strategy of the WOA and CSA. In addition to, there are two operators used to improve the quality of solution, namely hybrid individual operator and enhance diversity operator. The hybrid individual operator is used to exchanges individuals from the WOA and CSA systems by using the roulette wheel approach. In other hand, the HWCA performs enhance diversity operator to improve the quality of each system. More over, the HWCA is incorporated with center optimization strategy to enhance diversity of each system. In the performance evaluation, the proposed MPGO algorithm was comparison WOA and CSA algorithm with six well-known UCI benchmarks. The results show that the proposed algorithm has a higher measure of accuracy rate with comparison algorithms. © 2018 IEEE.","Crow search algorithm; Data Clustering; Hybrid approach; Whole optimization algorithm","Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Cluster analysis; Computational complexity; Data mining; Learning algorithms; Optimization; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Data clustering; Hybrid algorithms; Hybrid approach; Optimization algorithms; Optimization strategy; Quality of solution; Search Algorithms; Search strategies; Clustering algorithms",,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST

Word2vec is an unsupervised task that is capable of utilizing unlabeled data to convert a word into its vector representation that can also find the semantic relationship between words by counting their distance. The goal from this paper is that data from social media such as Twitter or Instagram can also quickly find out the total /weight of a tourist place from the comment given. The experiment shows that the result of F1 Score on data without removing stop words and eliminate the train data, give a better result 0,85. © ASERS Publishing.

Sarcasm flips the polarity of a sentence and will affect the accuracy of sentiment analysis task. Recent researches incorporate machine learning and deep learning methods to detect sarcasm. Sarcasm can be detected by the occurrence of context disparity. This feature can be detected by observing the similarity score of each word in the sentence. Word embedding vector is used to calculate word similarity score. In this work, the word similarity score is incorporated as an augmented feature in the deep learning model. Three augmenting schemes in deep learning models are observed. Results show that in general, a word similarity score boosts the performance of the classifier.

This research proposes a model of effort estimation for web-based mobile application developed using object oriented approach. In the proposed model, functional size measurement of object oriented based web application named OOmFPWeb, web metric and mobile characteristic for web-based mobile application size measurement are combnined. The estimation process is done by using mamdani fuzzy logic method. To evaluate the proposed model, the comparison between OOmFPWeb as the variable that affect effort estimation for web-based mobile application and the proposed model are performed. The evaluation result shows that effort estimation for web-based mobile application with the proposed model is better than just using OOmFPWeb. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Functional; Fuzzy logic; Hypermedia; Mobile application effort estimation",,,,,,,"Rao, D.M., (2012) Mobile Southeast Asia Report, , Mobile Monday; Schwalbe, K., Information Technology: Project Management (2010) Course Technology, pp. 8-9. , 6th Edition ed., C Learning, Ed., Boston; Mendes, E.N., Mosley, S.C., Investigating Early Web Size Measures for Web Cost Estimation (2003) Procedings of the EASE' 2003 Conference, pp. 1-22; Abrahao, S., Poels, G., A Family of Experiment to Evaluate a Fuctional Size Measurement Procedure for Web Applications (2009) Journal of Systems and Software, 82 (2), pp. 253-269; Souza, L.S., Aquino, G.S., Jr., Estimating the Effort of Mobile Application Development (2014) CS & IT, pp. 45-63; Shepperd, M., Schofield, C., Kitchenham, B., Effort Estimation Using Analogy (1996) Proceeding of ICSE-18; Myrtveit, I., Stensrud, E., A Controller Experiment to Assess the Benefits of Estimating with Analogy and Regression Model (1999) IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering, 25 (4), pp. 510-525; Shepperd, M.J., Schofield, C., Estimating Software Project Effort Using Analogies (1997) IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering, 23 (11), pp. 736-743; Suharjito, S., Jimmy, J., Girsang, A.S., Mobile Decision Support System to Determine Toddler's Nutrition Using Fuzzy Sugeno (2017) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE), 7 (6), pp. 3683-3691; Lubis, A.J., Susanto, E., Sunarya, U., Implementation of Maximum Power Point Tracking on Photovoltaic Using Fuzzy Logic Algorithm (2015) TELKOMNIKA (Telecommunication Computing Electronics and Control), 13 (1), pp. 32-40; Sharma, V., Verma, H.K., Optimized Fuzzy Logic Based Framework for Effort Estimation in Software Development (2010) IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science, 7 (2), pp. 30-38; Kumar, N.V.R.S., Mandala, A., Chaitanya, M.V., Prasad, G., Fuzzy Logic for Software Effort Estimation Using Polynomial Regression as Firing Interval (2011) IJCTA, pp. 1843-1847; Prasad, P.R., Sudha, K.R., Rama, P.R., Application of Fuzzy Logic Approach to Software Effort Estimation (2011) IJACSA International Journal of Advance Computer Science and Application, 2 (5), pp. 87-92; Malathi, S., Sridhar, D.S., Optimization of Fuzzy Analogy in Software Cost Estimation Using Lingustic Variables (2012) Procedia Engineering, 32, pp. 177-190; Ziauddin, S., Kamal, S., Khan, J.A.N., A Fuzzy Logic Based Software Cost Estimation Model (2013) International Journal of Software Engineering and Its Application, 7, pp. 7-18; Suharjito, S., Nanda, B.S., Modeling software effort estimation using hybrid PSO-ANFIS (2016) Int.

In order to ensure the security of the information, then in 2015 PT. IndoDev Niaga Internet implement ISO 27001: 2013. Through the implementation of ISO 27001: 2013, it is expected that information can be properly maintained, which in turn will affect the business continuity. Companies need to know the extent to which the process has been applied and what actions can be done to improve the performance of the application of ISO 27001: 2013. Factor analysis was conducted first to determine the factors that affect to the information security. After the factors that affect to the information security known, then observation and interview conducted to gather data about PT. IndoDev Niaga Internet ISO 27001:2013 implementation according to the factors that affect. And then recommendation and corrective action developed using gap analysis method. The most influential factor to the security of customer information PT. IndoDev Niaga Internet is a factor access control and security operations. For the audit results IS027001: 2013 from the aspect of access control, they found 11 check items that fit into the category of NC (Non-Conformance) of 33 check items in which 9 of them in the category of major and two remaining categories minor, while for operations security aspects of the 12 check items, found 5 that goes into the category of NC (Non-Conformance) and everything was included into the category of minor. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Access control; Business continuity; Business solutions; Customer information; Enterprise resource planning (ERP); Human resource information systems; Influential factors; Information assets; Security operations; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,,"Padyab, A.M., (2013) Towards More Structured Information Asset Identification Approach for Risk Assessment Methods; Stoneburner, G., Goguen, A., Feringa, A., (2002) Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems Recommendations of the National Institute of Standards and Technology; Kazemi, M., Khajouei, H., Nasrabadi, H., (2012) Evaluation of Information Security Management System Success Factors : Case Study of Municipal Organization, 6, pp. 4982-4989; Thomas, R., (2014) Information Security Fundamentals, , 2; Vacca, J., (2014) Managing Information Security; Andress, J., (2011) The Basic of Information Security; Calder, A., Watkins, S., (2008) IT GOVERNANCE; Hai, H., Wang, K.-M., (2014) The Critical Success Factors Assessment of ISO 27001 Certification in Computer Organization by Test-retest Reliability, 8, pp. 705-716; (2013) INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ISO / IEC Information Technology - Security Techniques - Information Security Management Systems - Requirements, 2013. , I.27001:2013 2013; Devellis, R., (2012) Scale Development: Theory and Applications, , (Sage); Byrne, B.M., (2010) Structural Equation Modeling with AMOS, 2. , (Taylor amp; Francis Group); Marrone, M., (2011) The Business Benefits of Effective ITSM; Wan, J., Evaluation on Information Technology Service Management Process with AHP (2011) Technol.

The task of integrating such system is quite complicated, especially the integration of the financial technology system. In addition to being integrated, the flow of data and business processes must effectively reach every part which has interests in the process and the data. Business productivity can be achieved if the required data flows smoothly and is accessible as efficient as possible. Similarly, a bank which usually uses more than one information systems, when it need to combine financial statements from different bank systems must go through a data transformation mechanism to be accessible. Especially if the users of some bank accounts must access all their banking accounts at one time, of course, this would not be easy. As a response to those situations, in this research we proposed a financial technology application integration based on SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) which could be used to combine financials statements of all integrated banks every month. The data required to create a composite report will be directly taken from the system of any bank by utilizing web services. It is expected that the results from this study could help the parties interested in SOA-based Fin Tech with the understanding and description of SOA, such as: how it works, its benefits, and the role of SOA layers implemented in Fin Tech applications. © 2018 IEEE.","Architecture; Fin Tech; SOA; System","Architecture; Citrus fruits; Finance; Fins (heat exchange); Information services; Integration; Metadata; Web services; Business productivity; Customer expectation; Fin Tech; Financial transactions; Soa (serviceoriented architecture); System; Technology application; Technology Integration; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,,"Papazoglou, M.P., Georgakopoulos, D., Service oriented computing: Introduction (2003) Communications of the ACM, 46 (10), pp. 25-28; Meredith, L.G., Bjorg, S., Contracts and types (2003) Communications of the ACM, 46 (10), pp. 41-47; Arsanjani, A., (2004) Service-oriented Modeling and Architecture, p. 2; Josuttis Nicloai, M., SOA in practice (2007) O'Relly 2007, p. 210; Richard, B., (2005) Extensible Architectures: The Strategic Value of Service-oriented Architecture in Banking, , Department of Computer Information Systems, Robinson College of Business, Georgia State University; Bret, K., (2010) Bank 2.0: How Customer Behaviour and Technology Will Change the Future of Financial Services-Marshall Cavendish, , Business; Riad, A.M., Hassan, Q.F., Service-oriented architecture-A new alternative to traditional integration methods in B2B applications (2008) JCIT, 3 (1). , March 31, 2008; Papazoglou, M.P., Service-oriented computing: Concepts, characteristics, and directions (2003) Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE'03); Fajar, A.N., Legowo, N., Services modeling based on SOA and BPM for information system flexibility improvement (2018) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 8 (4), pp. 2451-2455; Fajar, A.N., Nurcahyo, A., Sriratnasari, S.R., SOA system architecture for interconnected modern higher education in Indonesia (2018) Procedia Computer Science the 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Computational Intelligence (ICCSCI 2018); 10 Best Android Budget Apps for Money Management, , https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-budget-apps-for-moneymanagement-586807/, Android Authority, 16-Jul-2018.

According to Bank Indonesia (BI) standars, if a bank has a non performing loan (NPL) or a value above 5% so the bank suffers losses. In this case, the bank must have a strategy to reduce this value to be stable. Bank XYZ concern about performance of collectors because the collector is the core of the bank. The solution for this case study is using business intelligence carried on the data warehouse and OLAP development. So this paper describes how important the selection of data that can help managers to make decision so that performance can be better. © 2018 IEEE.","Business Intelligence; Data Warehouse; Loan Colection","Citrus fruits; Competitive intelligence; Data warehouses; Collection performance; Indonesia; Loan Colection; Information analysis",,,,,,"Reinhart, C., Rogoff, K., (2010) From Financial Crash to Debt Crisis, , NBER Working Paper 15795; Murphy, S.N., Avillach, P., Bellazi, R., Phillips, L., Gabetta, M., Eran, A., McDuffie, M.T., Kohane, I.S., Combining clinical and geonomics queris using i2b2-Three methods (2017) PloS One; Abelló, A., Romero, O., Pedersen, T.B., Berlanga, R., Nebot, V., Aramburu, M.J., Simitsis, A., Using semantic web technologies for exploratory OLAP: A survey (2015) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 27 (2), pp. 571-588; Kimball, R., Ross, M., (2016) The Kimball Group Reader: Relentlessly Practical Tools for Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence Remastered Collection 2 Ed, , John Wiley & Sons; Negash, S., (2004) Business Intelligence, Communications of the Association Systems, 13, pp. 177-195; Olszak, Celina, M., Zeimba, E., (2007) Approach to Building and Implementing.

To ensure that no links are broken there is a need for a link checker testing application. But manual testing requires a lot of resources, expensive cost, and takes a long time to check the whole deployment must be done every day, so in this study the manufacture of link checker testing application will run automatically and integrated with Jenkins. With this application, developers can fix broken links in the development stage before being consumed by the public. Automation link checker testing application is using Jenkins as continuous integration tools, Shell Script, PHP Unit framework and PHP programming language will check all the links in the website automatically and report from the test results.

Moreover, most of them have the same service or feature for serving their customers. To get back the feedback of their customers, many companies use social media (Facebook and Twitter) for marketing activity or communicating directly with their customers. The development of current technology allows the company to take data from social media. Thus, many companies take social media data for analyses. This study proposed developing a data warehouse to analyze data in social media such as likes, comments, and sentiment. Since the sentiment is not provided directly from social media data, this study uses lexicon based classification to categorize the sentiment of users' comments. This data warehouse provides business intelligence to see the performance of the company based on their social media data. The data warehouse is built using three travel companies in Indonesia. As a result, this data warehouse provides the comparison of the performance based on the social media data. © 2018 Halmstad University.","Business intelligence; Lexicon based classification; Sentiment analysis; Social media",,,,,,,"Adriani, M., Asian, J., Nazief, B., Tahaghoghi, S.M., Williams, H.E., Stemming Indonesian: A confix-stripping approach (2007) Journal ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing (TALIP); Alalwan, A.A., Rana, N.P., Dwivedi, Y.K., Algharabatc, R., Social media in marketing: A review and analysis of the existing literature (2017) Telematics and Informatics, pp. 1177-1190; Atmadjati, A., (2012) Era Maskapai Saat Ini, , Yogyakarta: Leutika Prio; Barlow, J., Maul, D., (2000) Emotional Value: Creating Strong Bonds with Your Customers, , San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler Pub-lishers, Inc; Bo, P., Lee, L., Vaithyanathan, S., Thumbs up?

In the recently, the cluster problem has been proven as NP-hard problem, thus, it can be solved with meta-heuristic algorithms, such as the particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and ant colony optimization (ACO), respectively. This paper proposes an algorithm called Fast Ant Colony Optimization for Clustering (FACOC) to reduce the computation time of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) in clustering problem. FACOC is developed by the motivation that a redundant computation is occurred in ACO for clustering. This redundant computation can be cut in order to reduce the computation time of ACO for clustering. The proposed FACOC algorithm was verified on 5 well-known benchmarks. Experimental result shows that by cutting this redundant computation, the computation time can be reduced about 28% while only suffering a small quality degradation. © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Generally, the heuristic algorithm will take the high computation time to solve optimization problem. Likewise, ABC also consumes too much time to solve clustering problem. This paper intends solving clustering problem using ABC with focusing reduction computation time called FABCC. This idea proposes detecting the pattern of redundant process then compacting it to effective process to diminish the computation process.

This makes business reporting less efficient and overwhelms query processing results in data warehouses so that they do not meet business requirements. The fast and complex evolution of the digital world must be scalable to the data warehouse process, so that the authors implement it in the data warehouse using massive parallel processing (MPP) with the Greenplum database, so that business users can get reports faster and more optimally. This case study explains how the MPP system implements and measures the performance of the Greenplum database by performing complex queries in the data warehouse with parallel processing. Therefore, this case study analyzes whether the use of MPP systems can measure the scalability of throughput and the response time in the data warehouse so that system performance in the Greenplum database remains stable for daily, weekly, and monthly operations. © 2018 The Authors.

However, data used in master production schedule and material requirement planning come from various sources which have various types of data without good integration. This makes the forecasting of production planning and inventory control to provide raw materials for production not adequate. One of the applications for production planning and inventory control is EXACT. However, the application is operational-based. Thus, it cannot show the analysis of data. This paper proposes a data warehouse system that can provide a report for the production planning and inventory control system. By using a data warehouse, the necessary reports can be served quickly and flexibly in accordance with the needs of planning and inventory control system. Kimball Nine step is a method employed for designing a data warehouse, especially if each part is designed gradually. The development of data warehouse can give the report faster and more complete by accessing the dashboard.

This study aims to look at the accuracy of Geometric Moment invariant (GMI) and Zernike Moment invariant (ZMI) with Self-Organizing Maps to recognize human ears. This study used data from ear AMI database, consisting of 125 ears from 25 different people, in which each person has 5 images of the right ear. In this study, each image of the ear is modified with a different rotation angle. The accuracy of ear image recognition using GMI is 75.20% while using ZMI is 66%. The accuracy of using Geometric Moment Invariant is higher by 9.2% because Geometric Moment Invariant does not change the result of the image to be recognized due to translation, scaling, reflection and rotation.GMI cannot recognize the image of the ear with an average of 24.80% while the ZMI cannot recognize the image of the ear with an average of 34.40%. From the test results, at a rotation angle of 30 ° CCW, the geometric moment method has the best accuracy, while the Zernike moment method has the best accuracy at 30 ° CW.

The robust agents, called ant-bees, firstly are grouped into three types scout, follower, recruiter at each stages. Then, the bad agents are high probably discarded, while the good agents are high probably duplicated in earlier steps. This first two steps mimic BCO algorithm. However, constructing tours such as choosing nodes, and updating pheromone are built by ELU-Ants method. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, HABCO is performed on several benchmark datasets and compared to ACS and BCO.

The smaller deterioration on host media after embedding the information, the system hiding is more successful because it shows there is no significant different between the original host image and the host image after embedded. This study proposes hiding information into a host image so that the deterioration is minimal using least significant bit (LSB) substitution and modified ant algorithm. The minimal deterioration is achieved when each pixels on the information is appropriate hidden on pixels on host media. The minimal deterioration as objective function is get by chasing the maximal peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). This proposed method is implemented on some hosts image with two image information.

The institution needs the comprehensive documents for giving the information accurately before reviewed by assessor. Therefore, academic documents should be stored effectively to ease fulfilling the requirement of accreditation. However, the data are generally derived from various sources, various types, not structured and dispersed. This paper proposes designing a data warehouse to integrate all various data to prepare a good academic document for accreditation in a university. The data warehouse is built using nine steps that was introduced by Kimball. This method is applied to produce a data warehouse based on the accreditation assessment focusing in academic part. The data warehouse shows that it can analyse the data to prepare the accreditation assessment documents. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data warehouses; Education; Accreditation",,,,,,"Bassil, Y., A Data Warehouse Design for A Typical University Information System (2012) J.

Kebon Jeruk Raya No 27, Jakarta, Indonesia","As the main public company in telecommunication and broadband business in Indonesia, PT XYZ has always tried to ensure adequate wifi access service to meet the needs of broadband consumers. This wifi service, called wifi-id, uses an Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA) server by collaborating with the other network providers. This study was based on the need of PT. XYZ to present reports or data quickly when needed, especially when PT. XYZ needs to reconcile the total monthly customer usage with business partners in order to do billing revenue sharing partnership. The problem arises because the script of CDR (called data record), which represents the use of broadband consumers, is stored in the form of CSV file only. It makes it difficult to make a report of customer access which is needed by PT. XYZ. The suggested solution is to move the existing data into a more structured storage in data warehouse. Data warehouse development was done through a nine-step methodology designed by Kimball and Ross. Furthermore, the data can be analyzed using OLAP to present the data in a visual form such as report or dashboard. With this solution, PT. XYZ can process and present the report relatively faster. Additionally, PT. XYZ will also get more benefit from the data stored in the form of information. © 2017 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Authentication Authorization Accounting; Data Warehouse; OLAP Analysis; Radius Protocol; Radius Server; WIFI",,,,,,,"Agung, M., Kistijantoro, A.I., High performance CDR processing with MapReduce (2015) Telecommunication Systems Services and Applications (TSSA), 2015 9Th International Conference On, pp. 1-6; Atay, C.E., Alp, G., Modeling and Querying Multidimensional Bitemporal Data Warehouses (2016) Int.

One of the important issues in comparison matrix of AHP is the consistency. The inconsistent comparison matrix cannot be used to make decision. This paper proposes an algorithm using a modified BicriterionAnt to pursue two objectives intended to rectify the inconsistent fuzzy preference matrix, called MOBAF. The two objectives include minimizing the consistent ratio (CR) and minimizing the deviation matrix, which are in conflict with each other when rectifying the inconsistent matrix. This study uses two pheromone matrices and two heuristic distances matrices to generate the ants tour. To see the performance, MOBAF is implemented to rectify on some inconsistent fuzzy preference matrices. As a result, in addition to being able to rectify the CR, the proposed algorithm also successfully generates some non-dominated solutions that can be considered as optimal solutions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Analytic hierarchy process; Bicriterionant; Fuzzy preference matrix; Inconsistent","Algorithms; Analytic hierarchy process; Decision making; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Bicriterionant; Comparison matrix; Decision making tool; Fuzzy preference matrix; Fuzzy preferences; Inconsistent; Nondominated solutions; Hierarchical systems",,,,,,"Bozóki, S., Fülöp, J., Rónyai, L., On optimal completion of incomplete pairwise comparison matrices (2010) Math Comput Model, 52 (1), pp. 318-333; Chaharsooghi, S.K., Kermani, A.M., An intelligent multi-colony multi-objective ant colony optimization (aco) for the 0–1 knapsack problem (2008) Evolutionary computation, 2008.

PSO is used to optimize the membership function of ANFIS by changing the parameter premise and consequent parameters on ANFIS. This proposed method is implemented in each province in Indonesia. The results indicate that the accuracy of the proposed method increased significantly compared to the standard adaptive neuro-fuzzy inferences system.

ACPSO employs an adaptive method by choosing a seeking mode or tracing mode based on a mixture ratio (MR). In the tracing mode, this algorithm uses a modified particle swarm optimization to increase diversity solutions.

For achieving consistency in the inconsistent matrix, researchers usually change the consistent ratio (CR) and the deviation matrix. The pursuit of a minimal CR is important, since this index directly measures the consistency matrix in the AHP. While the deviation matrix should be minimal such that the original opinion of the decision makes is preserved. Ideally, the both value of CR and deviation matrix should be minimal. However, in fact those two objectives will be conflicted if both of them are optimized simultaneously. Therefore, a non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-2 (NSGA-2) for solving the multi-objective problems is considered as an appropriate approach for solving this problem. Six inconsistent AHP matrices are successfully repaired using NSGA-2. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.","AHP; Consistent ratio; Genetic algorithm; NSGA-2","Analytic hierarchy process; Genetic algorithms; Hierarchical systems; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Consistent ratio; Multi objective; Multi-objective problem; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; NSGA-2; Problem solving",,,,,,"Saaty, T.L., (1980) The Analytic Hierarchy Process, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Saaty, T.L., (1984) Decision Making for Leaders, 7. , Esf Editeur; Girsang, A.S., Tsai, C.-W., Yang, C.-S., Ant algorithm for modifying an inconsistent pairwise weighting matrix in an analytic hierarchy process (2014) Neural Comput.

As inconsistent comparison matrix cannot be used as reference to make decisions, this paper proposes a method using an ant algorithm to modify an inconsistent pairwise weight matrix to be consistent in AHP, called ANTAHP. This method employs the matrix element as the path in an ant colony optimization to construct the tour. By laying pheromone information on their path, the ants can find the optimal matrix (or tour), which satisfies the consistency and closer to the original judgment of the decision makers. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to make consistent matrices, as well as minimize the difference index. © 2014, Springer-Verlag London.","Ant algorithm; Consistent ratio; Inconsistent matrix; Pairwise weight matrix","Analytic hierarchy process; Ant colony optimization; Decision making; Hierarchical systems; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Ant algorithms; Comparison matrix; Consistent matrices; Consistent ratio; Matrix elements; Weight matrices; Weighting matrices; Algorithms",,,,,,"Alonso, J.A., Lamata, M.T., Consistency in the analytic hierarchy process: a new approach (2006) Int J Uncertain Fuzziness Knowl Based Syst, 14 (4), pp. 445-459; Blum, C., Sampels, M., An ant colony optimization algorithm for shop scheduling problems (2004) J Math Model Algorithms, 3 (3), pp. 285-308; Cao, D., Leung, L.C., Law, J., Modifying inconsistent comparison matrix in analytic hierarchy process: a heuristic approach (2008) Decis Support Syst, 44 (4), pp. 944-953; Chamodrakas, I., Batis, D., Martakos, D., Supplier selection in electronic marketplaces using satisfying and fuzzy AHP (2010) Expert Syst Appl, 37 (1), pp. 490-498; Chen, S.M., Lin, T.E., Lee, L.W., Group decision making using incomplete fuzzy preference relations based on the additive consistency and the order consistency (2014) Inf Sci, 259, pp. 1-15; Chiclana, F., Herrera-Viedma, E., Alonso, S., Herrera, F., Cardinal consistency of reciprocal preference relations: a characterization of multiplicative transitivity (2009) IEEE Trans Fuzzy Syst, 17 (1), pp. 14-23; da Serra Costa, J.F., A genetic algorithm to obtain consistency in analytic hierarchy process (2011) Brazilian J Oper Produc Manag, 8 (1), pp. 55-64; Dong, Y., Zhang, G., Hong, W.C., Xu, Y., Consensus models for AHP group decision making under row geometric mean prioritization method (2010) Decis Support Syst, 49 (3), pp. 281-289; Dorigo, M., Gambardella, L.M., Ant colony system: a cooperative learning approach to the traveling salesman problem (1997) IEEE Trans Evol Comput, 1 (1), pp. 53-66; Dorigo, M., Maniezzo, V., Colorni, A., Ant system: optimization by a colony of cooperating agents (1996) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern Part B, 26 (1), pp. 29-41; Durán, O., Computer-aided maintenance management systems selection based on a fuzzy AHP approach (2011) Adv Eng Softw, 42 (10), pp. 821-829; Ergu, D., Kou, G., Peng, Y., Shi, Y., A simple method to improve the consistency ratio of the pair-wise comparison matrix in ANP (2011) Eur J Oper Res, 213 (1), pp. 246-259; Gambardella, L.M., Taillard, É., Agazzi, G., (1999) Macs-vrptw: a multiple colony system for vehicle routing problems with time windows, , In, New ideas:; Genç, S., Boran, F.E., Akay, D., Xu, Z., Interval multiplicative transitivity for consistency, missing values and priority weights of interval fuzzy preference relations (2010) Inf Sci, 180 (24), pp. 4877-4891; Gomez-Ruiz, J.A., Karanik, M., Peláez, J.I., (2009), Improving the consistency of AHP matrices using a multi-layer perceptron-based model Bio-inspired systems: computational and ambient intelligence, pp. 41-48. , Springer, Berlin:; Güngör, Z., Serhadlıoğlu, G., Kesen, S.E., A fuzzy AHP approach to personnel selection problem (2009) Appl Soft Comput, 9 (2), pp. 641-646; Ishizaka, A., Lusti, M., An expert module to improve the consistency of AHP matrices (2004) Int Trans Oper Res, 11 (1), pp. 97-105; Kwiesielewicz, M., van Uden, E., (2002) Problem of inconsistent and contradictory judgements in pairwise comparison method in sense of AHP.

Although BCO was robustness optimization, but likes the other algorithm for solving optimization problem, BCO has many reduncation computations on its convergence process, as a consequence, it will more computation time. Two operators are developed to BCOPR in this paper. The first one BCOPR1, is used to cut down the computation time by avoiding performing the same process on the preferred edge. On the second operator, BCOPR2, a bee is possible to duplicate the best previous-iteration tour if her first stage tour is the same with part of the best previous-iteration tour. In addition, likes BCO original, BCOPR is also use local search to enhance the quality solution. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, BCOPR uses some various benchmarks of TSP. Our experimental results show BCOPR reduce computation time as well as achieve good solution. © 2012 IEEE.","Bee colony optimization; Computation Time; Pattern Reduction; Travelling Salesman Problem","Colony optimization; Computation time; Convergence process; Local search; Optimization problems; Travelling salesman problem; Algorithms; Benchmarking; Iterative methods; Traveling salesman problem",,,,,,"Kirkpatrick, S., Gelatt, C.D., P, M., Vecchi Optimization by Simulated Annealing (1983) Science, 220 (4598), pp. 671-680; Glover, F., Tabu search-Part I (1989) ORSA J.

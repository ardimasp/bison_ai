Collecting data using interview, documentation study and, questionnaire. To analysis using fit gap analysis, cost benefit analysis and information technology balance score card. The results shows very high gap in operational aspect, positive NPV and payback period on target management in financial aspect, and most users not satisfied with the current system in intangible aspect. Conclusion of this study is that there is a gap in the system of fixed assets that are still running that required significant changes to the system. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

Before investing information system it is necessary to conduct a feasibility study on running information systems in order to obtain an overview of the support that can be provided by the old system. The method of this study was performed by conducting surveys and interviews for data collection and analysis methods with fit gap analysis, cost benefit analysis and information technology balanced scorecard. The results of this study by using a fit gap analysis showed that only 10% of the system running with fit criteria, so it is necessary to change the system. Proposed new system will provide a 3.9 year payback period of 5 years management estimates. Average achievement by using information technology balanced scorecard is 93.5%. The conclusion that can be drawn from this study is the firm should invest in hospitality management information system by looking at the aspects of operational and financial aspects. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

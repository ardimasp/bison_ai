One problem that has not been considered in the design of sports centers in Jakarta is the provision of facilities for persons with disabilities, in order to that they have the same opportunities as other normal people in using sports centers. From the results of a study using descriptive methods through observation of existing sports centers, the results are obtained that to realize a livable public facilities requires the design of a sports center that applies the principles of Universal Design, namely Equitable Use, Flexibility in Use, Perceptible Information, Simple & Intuitive, Tolerance for Error, Low Physical Effort, Size and Space for Approach Use. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","disabilities; sport center; universal design","Design; Recreation centers; disabilities; Government IS; Persons with disabilities; Public facilities; Rehabilitation programs; Sport centers; Sports center; Universal Design; Sports",,,,,"United Nations Habitat, , http://www.un-documents.net/ha-4c.htm#C-11; (2008) What Is Social Development, , https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/esic/overview/content/what_is_social_development.html, Economic and Social Inclusion Corporation; Banton, M., Makalah Integrasi Sosial: Pengertian, Bentuk, Tahapan, Contoh Dan Faktor, , https://www.gurupendidikan.co.id/integrasi-sosial/; Gilin Integrasi Sosial, , https://www.gurupendidikan.co.id/integrasi-sosial/; Nimkoff, F.D., Syarat Berhasilnya Suatu Integrasi Social, , https://www.gurupendidikan.co.id/integrasi-sosial/","Nurdiani, N.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: nnurdiani@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

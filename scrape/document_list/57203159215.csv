News aggregator system requires a crawler to populate its content; however, different website may have a different page layout. This projects aims to create a back-end for Noox and open source and scalable web crawler that is capable to extract data from different page layout. The scope of this project includes the web crawler, CMS, API, scheduler for web crawler, and implementation of socket server. The development process utilizes PHP as the primary back-end language with Laravel as the web application framework. The PHP back-end hosts the CMS and the API. The API itself will implement Representational State Transfer (REST) as its architectural design. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is used as means of the API to communicate with the clients. The API also implements JSON Web Token (JWT) for client authentication purpose. Python programming language is used to develop the web crawler. The web crawler utilizes BeautifulSoup as the web extraction utility. The web crawler can be adapted to extract data from different page layout by utilizing user created configuration file. It can also be configured to export the extracted data into a JSON file or database system. The result of this project satisfies the requirement of the Noox project. © 2017 IEEE.","Application Programming Interface; CMS; HTML Extraction; Web Crawler; Web Scrapper","Application programming interfaces (API); Artificial intelligence; Computer systems programming; Curium; Extraction; High level languages; Open source software; Client authentication; Content management system; JavaScript object notations (JSON); Python programming language; Representational state transfer; Scalable web crawlers; Web application frameworks; Web Scrapper; Web crawler",,,,,"Nielsen, J., (2010) Mental Models, , https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models/, 18 October; Hart, W., Albarracin, D., Eagly, A.H., Brechan, I., Lindberg, M.J., Merrill, L., Feeling validated versus being correct: A meta-analysis of selective exposure to information (2009) Psychological Bulletin, 135 (4), pp. 555-588; Chowdhury, S., Landoni, M., News aggregator services: User expectations and experience (2006) Online Information Review, 30 (2), pp. 100-115; Boiko, B., Understanding content management (2001) Bulletin of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 28 (1), pp. 8-13; Koster, M., (1996) The web robots pages, , http://support.kharkiv.ukrtelecom.ua/lib/TheWebRobotPages.pdf, [Accessed 2 October 2017]; Heydon, A., Najork, M., Mercator: A scalable, extensible web crawler (1999) World Wide Web: Internet Web Inf Syst, 2 (4), pp. 219-229; Brin, S., Page, L., The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual web search engine (1998) Proceedings of the Seventh International World Wide Web Conference, pp. 107-117; Burner, M., Crawling towards eternity: Building an archive of the world wide web (1977) Web Techniques Magazine, 2, p. 5; GitHub Repository, 6 December 2016, , https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy, Scrapinghub Ltd.

The algorithm was tested in measuring the company's growth performance using a balanced scorecard (BSC) strategic planning model. This paper is proposed to continue the previous study by expanding the concept in measuring company growth, not only using BSC but also SWOT analysis as the strategic planning model and then to develop its application through coding procedure and more focused to code the assessment of BLCA. Then, we build the application using Java programming language. As a result, the model could be applied in companies to measure company's growth performance by comparing those two strategic planning models. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

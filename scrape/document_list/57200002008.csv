Going-concern-modified audit reports are seen as a credible signal from auditors regarding the financial condition of the company. This research analyses determinants of going-concern-modified audit reports in Indonesia and Singapore. Despite the difference of these two countries, our findings show similar evidence in both countries. Even though prior studies document that companies' characteristics, companies' financial performance and auditors' characteristics may determine the issuance of going-concern-modified audit reports, it is not evident in our study. Despite these variables, we found that the previous year audit report is a significant determinant of issuance of a going-concern- modified audit report. This suggests that this report is a credible signal of a company's financial distress.

Indonesian health regulation addresses all health providers, midwives and physicians that conducting medical practices should conduct patient Emergency Referral Information (ERI) exchange before referring the patient to other hospital facility.

Indonesian Ministry of Health (MoH) and supported by the US government (USAID) had initiated the EMAS project during 2012-2016 to accelerate the declination of maternal and neonatal mortality rates. The EMAS project embraced the utilization of information and communication technology (ICT), with the main goals to develop a set of integrated interventions to strengthen emergency referral systems including establishing emergency referral information system (IS).","(2015) Sistem Pertukaran Rujukan SijariEMAS, , USAID; Caiol, N., (2017) Final Report : The USAID Expanding Maternal and Neonatal Survival (EMAS) Program; DeLone, W.H., McLean, E.R., The DeLone and McLean Model of Information Systems Success: A Ten-Year Update (2003) Journal of Management Information Systems / Spring, 9, pp. 9-30; Jeong, H.Y., Kim, Y.H., A system software quality model using DeLone & McLean model and ISO/IEC 9126 (2012) International Journal of Digital Content Technology and Its Applications, 6 (5), pp. 181-188; Habsari, S.K., (2016) The Effectiveness and Perception of ICT Program Implementation in Enhancing Maternal and Newborn Survival among Pregnant Women in Indonesian Society, pp. 160-169; T.

Current IT system is dominated with independent applications that make difficult to monitor and control the data. Jakarta government has taken IT initiative to optimize the potential of regional income and encourage the taxpayer compliance in fulfilling the obligation of payment of local taxes as well as the creation of integration of revenue collection amongst all related units. Jakarta governor has encouraged the use of recent IT technology to support faster data retrieval and effective decision-making process. The article proposes the conceptual SOA framework and supported with web GIS and Big Data application to promote data exchange amongst all units. The use of SOA is expected to deliver reliable services, module reusability, scalability and interoperability. The outcome of the article is expected to be used as a reference for all province in Indonesia in integrating data that spread in all districts/sub-districts and task-forces, and promote better decision making. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Big data; Decision making; Electronic data interchange; Electronic document exchange; Interoperability; Reusability; Big data applications; Data retrieval; Decision making process; It technologies; Local taxes; Monitor and control; Task force; Tax incomes; Taxation",,,,,,,"Yong, O.K., Towards ASEAN Financial Integration.

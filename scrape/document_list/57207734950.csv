Knowledge at Pondok Indah Mall is still not well distributed. The company currently only focuses on knowledge of the organization, but what we need to know about individual knowledge is no less important and many have a role to play in addition to the standard operating procedure that we can receive information from companies, such as best practice, how to determine perspectives, negotiation techniques and more especially in terms of regenerating knowledge within the organization. The method used for this writing is the company's business process by approaching three components of knowledge management, people, process and technology. Then aligning the company's strategy and knowledge management strategy using the Zack framework, then designing a knowledge management system with the Tiwana framework approach. The Conclusion, KMS development is felt to be able to support employees to share knowledge well and reduce the time needed to solve cases or problems because they can use solutions stored in the data in the application and make it easier for employees to search documents. © 2018 IEEE.","Designing; KMS Application; Knowledge; Knowledge Management System (KMS)","Knowledge based systems; Pattern recognition; Personnel; Company's strategy; Culture of sharing; Designing; Innovation ideas; Knowledge; Knowledge management strategy; Knowledge management system; Standard operating procedures; Knowledge management",,,,,"Sopandi, O.D., Politeknik, S., Bandung, N., Saud, U.S., Implementasi knowledge management pada perguruan tinggi (2016) J.

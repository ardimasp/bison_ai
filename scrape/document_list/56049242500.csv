Most of the food waste comes from expired or unused goods that are not being consumed by the household. According to this condition, the purpose of this study to analyze and design a solution with a food management inventory using a mobile systems platform, that we called Fridger Inventory Management (FIM), which can control every item which is stored inside the fridge. The methodology of this study consists of an analysis process and system design. In the analysis process, focus on analyzing the business environment and collect the requirement with a survey, interview, and reference. In the design process, this study tries to build a model using UML (Unified Modelling Language) diagram, database, and user interface design. The output of the study will provide a solution with the applicable features to minimize the number of food waste. The system features will provide an expiry date reminder, fridge sharing feature that allows the inventory control by more than one user, then the system also provides the cooking recommendation based on what the user has in their fridge. With the implementation of these systems, Fridge users are assisted to manage stock of food effectively and it can reduce food waste with an effective and efficient fridge management system. © 2020 IEEE.","Food waste; Fridge; Inventory management; Mobile application","Food waste; Information management; Inventory control; Modeling languages; Refrigerators; User interfaces; Analysis process; Business environments; Food management; Inventory management; Management systems; Sharing features; UML (unified modelling language); User interface designs; Waste management",,,,,,"Tonini, D., Albizzati, P.F., Astrup, T.F., Environmental impacts of food waste: Learnings and challenges from a case study on UK (2018) Waste Manag., 76, pp. 744-766; Chung, S.S., Lo, C.W.H., Local waste management constraints and waste administrators in China (2008) Waste Manag., 28 (2), pp. 272-281; Mostafa, G.M.A., Shazly, M.M., Sherief, W.I., Development of a waste management protocol based on assessment of knowledge and practice of healthcare personnel in surgical departments (2009) Waste Manag., 29 (1), pp. 430-439; Bhuiyan, S.H., A crisis in governance: Urban solid waste management in Bangladesh (2010) Habitat Int., 34 (1), pp. 125-133; Dou, Z., Ferguson, J.D., Galligan, D.T., Kelly, A.M., Finn, S.M., Giegengack, R., Assessing u. s. food wastage and opportunities for reduction (2016) Glob.

The approach that used to enhance the sports organizations is sports science, which is a concept that contributes to the development of athletes by collaborating in many fields and studies, such as anatomy, physiology, psychology, engineering, chemistry, etc. The approach of Sport science articulates the technology that blended on all of the approached. Currently, the use of sports technology or science in Indonesia is also very low in all sports categories. Usually, the management and coaches look at player statistics based on manual data or reports to view player statistics periodically. There is still a lack of exploration to use player statistics to be used by coaches to improve the ability of the players and the organization. This research will propose how to develop sports science with a business intelligence approach that used the Kimball data mart approach as decision support in the field of sports so that management and coaches can apply the correct approach to improve the capacity of players and organizational development. The result of this study will provide the model of sports science that can be implemented for a professional sports organization in Indonesia. © 2020 IEEE.","Business intelligence; Decision support systems; Organization; Sport science; Sports","Decision making; Decision support systems; Information management; Research and development management; Data mart; Decision supports; Indonesia; Internal and external factors; Organization decisions; Organizational development; Sport science; Sports technologies; Sports",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

The problem is the large numbers of vehicles can cause limitation of the parking lots especially in malls or other public places. Usually people driving around the whole parking lots to find the available ones. when the parking lots are all full, driver must search for other places to park their vehicle immediately. Designing the Smart Parking Finder has the purpose of making it easier for users to get available parking spaces and showing the location of the existing parking lot. On the other hand, it also facilitates the search for parking lots, but can reduce the search time for parking lots, and can also save fuel.

Cashless Transaction exists because of fast majorities of human transaction evolved towards digital environment, this creates an opportunity where legal money exists, recorded, and exchanged in digital form. Thus cashless transaction will make less effort in currency operation cost, keep on track with expenses, connected anytime everywhere as long as connected with internet, and eliminates the needs of banknotes or receipt. Cashless Transaction have done over the past few years making life easier by reducing a number of objects to merge into 1 functional object that could make payments faster and simpler starting with check the first mark of cashless transaction that's still being used nowadays, but cashless transaction doesn't stop evolving in this modern era where money is demonetized, cashless transaction is moving into the digital grid resulting a breakthrough mobile wallets and online transfer that offers people flexibility because its technology advancement makes it possible to make payments anytime and anywhere since it's only depend on a secure network(internet) and a platform, therefore cashless transaction could be done as fast as possible saving precious time. Cashless transaction has some of key components such as security, UX, Functionality, Performance and Data Integrity. Five key components could make cashless transaction become reality but also poses a different threat to cashless transaction. Hacking is one of them. Hacking could be done by anyone that have the ability to compromise the transmission, the transmission needs to have more data protection thus the cashless transaction could be done safely and free of risk. © 2020 ACM.","Breakthrough; Cashless transaction; Compromise; Connected; Digital environment; Digital grid; Evolved; Expenses; Hacking; Key components; Merge; Operation cost; Reality","Personal computing; Security of data; Data integrity; Digital environment; Digital information; Electronic representations; Financial transactions; Functional object; Secure networks; Technology advancement; Electronic document exchange",,,,,,"https://shodhgangotri.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/123456789/4546/1/synopsis.pdf; https://www.quora.com/What-is-cashless-Transaction; https://www.quora.com/What-Are-The-Advantages-of-cashless-Transaction; https://www.quora.com/What-is-The-meaning-of-A-cashless-Transaction; https://dzone.com/articles/5-key-elements-of-digital-payment-systems; https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316429963_Cashless_transaction_Modes_advantages_and_disadvantages; https://www.charteredclub.com/cashless-payment/; Definition of Hacking | What is Hacking ?

To find suitable learning partner from industry or other higher education institution is not easy. it requires connection with many partners, and the competency of learning part-ners must match with learning topics so that they can collaborate in the learning process. This study focuses on exploring how to make learning partner recommender generators that can provide suggestions for higher education institutions according to courses and course topics using information gathered from the social media platform. The results of this study are modules of a recommender system that can gather required information on learning partners from social media platforms. The modules are important for the information of learning partner's experience and skill use for making the recommender system grouping according to courses and course topics in the social learning platform of higher education institutions. © 2020 ICIC International.

To accommodate this requirement many higher education's institutions try to create new initiatives to enrich the graduate's competency of students with working experience so it can reduce the gap competency that industry faced when they recruit fresh graduate. One of the solutions proposed by XYZ university for higher education institution is to create enrichment program. The enrichment program is a program to increase student experience in real world work environment. In this program, the students will involve in working environment to learn how to be the worker in company and they will do all responsibility as an employee. To facilitate the enrichment program can running well, this study will propose the systems to accommodate enrichment program operation. Therefore, the design of this system aims to identify, analyze needs, and design a website-based application that is integrated with learning management systems so it can be used easily by parties involved in the enrichment processes, such as student, study program departments, enrichment program division, and company as an enrichment partner. This application is designed using System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) method which refers to architecture design, interface design, and database design. The result of this study is the model of enrichment systems that can facilitate the daily operation of enrichment program to accommodate the requirement of each party (student, study program, enrichment division, and company as partner). © 2019 IEEE.","competency; enrichment; graduate; model; SDLC","Application programs; Blast enrichment; Education computing; Employment; Life cycle; Models; Architecture designs; competency; Educational institutions; graduate; Higher education institutions; Learning management system; SDLC; System development life cycles; Students",,,,,,"Sanchez, O.P., Terlizzi, M.A., Roberto, H., Cesar, D.O., Cost and time project management success factors for informa-tion systems development projects (2017) Int.

Based on this fact, many organizations take an opportunity to utilize social media as an additional channel to engage with their stakeholders. Social learning is one of the implementations of social media technology in higher education institution to collaborate with teaching and learning strategies. Many higher education institutions decide to involve social learning concept into their teaching and learning process because of the shifting generation of student, which most students today use social media to interact with each other. Based on this phenomenon, this study tried to compare the different impacts between e-learning as in condition and social learning system into learning outcome. In this study, authors divided two groups to test the linkages under different situations (social learning and e-learning systems) using sampling groups to draw the impact of these systems. This study is addressed to identify the influence of different channel learning media and to assess the influence into several output variables, which are participation, performance, and engagement. Moreover, concepts from information systems, education, and human behavior have been used with literature to the adoption of social learning systems. The result of this research has practical implications for higher education institution that is interested to implement social learning systems in their teaching and learning strategies. © 2018, ICIC International.

The development of the system is needed because the various separate source and data is not always available when Information Systems Department wants to do monitoring of student performance. Moreover, the data are not available on time that's make monitoring process becomes hampered so that the impact on the result of the student's performance. Therefore, this system is also to make it easier for users of the system to be able to view the performance of students in accordance with the data that is needed in the process of monitoring. The development of the systems is using System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) method, starting from the planning phase to planning the development of the system, then perform the analysis on the process of monitoring that is currently running and analyze the data related to the process of monitoring, then entered the stage of design to design the system that will be built into diagrams, then the last stage is the building of the monitoring system success students study based on web platform. In the student performance monitoring system there will be a data of students who have not yet reached minimum indicators, students who achieve minimum indicators and students who have passed the minimum limit indicator. From the data, users can also view every detail of each indicator. The data that user needs to monitor will be available in one place in the system monitoring and data can be used at any time in. © 2017 IEEE.","indicator; monitoring; student; study; success","Indicators (instruments); Information management; Life cycle; Students; Monitoring process; Student performance; Student performance monitoring; Student's performance; study; success; System development life cycles; System monitoring; Monitoring",,,,,,"(2010) Belajar Dan Faktor-Faktor Yang Mempengaruhinya, , Slameto, Jakarta: Rineka Cipta; Regier, J., Why is academic success important (2011) Applied Science and Technology Scholarship; Clark, G., Walker, M., Whittle, R., Attendance and Performance: Correlations and motives in lecture-based modules (2011) Journal of Geography in Higher Education, pp. 199-215; Cohn, E., Johnson, E., Class attendance and performance in principles of economics (2006) Education Economics, pp. 211-233; Davidovitch, N., Soen, D., Class attendance and students' evaluation of their college instructors (2006) College Student Journal, pp. 691-703; Chen, J., Lin, T., Class attendance and exam performance: A randomized experiment (2006) Society of Labor Economics (SOLE) Eleventh Annual Meetings, pp. 5-6; Silvestri, L., The effects of attendance on undergraduate methods course grades (2003) Education, 123, pp. 483-486; Van Schalkwyk, S., Menkveld, H., Ruiters, J., What's the story with class attendance?

Syahdan No. 9, Palmerah Jakarta Barat, 11480, Indonesia","The process of decision support for higher education institution to determine the concentration of study program becomes a significant problem because the student needs to analyse their interest, ability, and other factors as the qualification. A mistake in decision-making will be detrimental to the students' education level, and it can even affect their future. This is a problem that occurs every semester, not only within the scope of the faculty but also in the university. Therefore, this research proposes a model to ease the higher education institution in determining a concentration of student using AHP and TOPSIS method. AHP method is a decision support system that can give weight on criteria of concentration and test its consistency. This method is to give weight for each criterion of student concentration majoring in Information System. TOPSIS method has a concept that the appropriate alternative has the shortest distance with a positive ideal solution and has the farthest distance with a negative ideal solution. Moreover, the criteria for choosing the concentration are multiple intelligences, GPA, course score, and TOEFL score. Weights obtained from AHP become the input value in the TOPSIS method in sorting the alternatives to be selected. Then, the result of the sorting is being calculated for its accuracy level. Based on the calculation of 93 sample of student's concentration with AHP-TOPSIS method, 62 data are the same, so it results in the accuracy of 67%. An application with AHP-TOPSIS method can be used to help the university management in determining the concentration at Information System major for XYZ University. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.

Today there are a variety of tools used to communicate with stakeholder (supplier, customer, distributor, etc) in boundless place, so organizations' data will be kept in the various devices. The changing of this era drives the current trend of employees using their own laptop computers, cellular phones, smart phones, tablet, etc; both for personal and for work. However to successfully implement BYOD, the problems associated with privacy and security in BYOD environment should be identified. According to this circumstance, this study aims to identify some of the legal issues related to security and privacy challenge in BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) era, which can be a suggestion for institution to aware with these issues because security and privacy is the most important to any size of organization to run their business process. © 2016 IEEE.","BYOD; privacy challenge; security","Digital storage; Information management; Laptop computers; Personal computers; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Bring your own devices; Business Process; BYOD; Cellular Phone; Privacy and security; security; Security and privacy; Systematic literature review; Computer privacy",,,,,,"Eslahi, M., Naseri, M.V., Hashim, H., Tahir, N.M., Saad, E.H.M., BYOD: Current state and security challenges (2015) ISCAIE 2014-2014 IEEE Symp.

From many perspectives particularly for educational, it is interesting to examine how social media can contribute to the learning process. This channel can support an interactive process that occurs when a group of learners collaborates with other to combine their knowledge into new insights. This research focuses on identifying social learning factors framework that enable higher education to be sustainable and be more adaptive. It also depicts conceptual social learning ontology according to Zachman Framework for enhancing collaboration and increasing responsiveness by leveraging social media channel in higher education. The objective of this study is to support classification scheme for descriptive representations of the social learning model. That is not only doing the design artifacts, but it depicts all supportive components to the organizational perspective. This set of view appears to be universal of the subject or object being described, including what (data), how (function), where (network), who (people), when (time), and why (motivation).

The tremendous exposure of social media today has changed a new communication channel for all business process. Although it is for better support or worse, social media is very powerful because many organizations begin to initiate strategies and allocate resources to engage effectively with social media platform. Higher education as organizational learning is expected to concern with this situation because the orientation of education today exposed to students centered learning mechanism to provide them with a holistic learning experience. Social media was realized as an innovative and effective tool to provide innovative ways of involving and motivating students in the learning process. Therefore, there is a need to investigate how students perceive and use social media in providing a pedagogically virtual learning environment that could enhance their learning experience. To achieve the goals of infusing social media into traditional pedagogical approach, the research investigates the preferences channel of social media for collaborative learning in the context of higher education as educational platform. A descriptive survey method used in this evaluation to show the trend in higher education. The result clearly describes social media preferences in the community of higher education so that learners can be actively engaged with learning process and flexible environments for global communication sharing. © 2016 IEEE.","Higher education; preferences; social learning; Social media","Computer aided instruction; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Students; Surveys; Collaborative learning; Descriptive survey method; Higher education; Organizational learning; preferences; Social learning; Social media; Virtual learning environments; Education",,,,,,"Chitiba, C.A., Lifelong learning challenges and opportunities for traditional universities (2012) Procedia-Soc.

Higher education as a place to educate and share knowledge has to realize these phenomena. With social media, organization supports the knowledge sharing process within organization. Then it changes learning mechanism from e-learning into social learning environment. According to this fact, this research will combine the concepts of knowledge management and social learning as a model framework's component by identifying the significant factors and its relationship with social media. A systematic and relevant literature review from journals and textbooks was conducted to support the development of component framework model. As the result, we propose an integrated model of knowledge management with social learning for higher education. © 2016 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.","E-learning; Higher education; Knowledge management;

A number of companies have built sophisticated system to fulfill operational. To maximize the benefit of the system, the data has to be stored in database for long time period so it can be used for analysis in the future. There are many models Database Management System (DBMS) architecture that can be applied, one of them are NoSQL architecture. NoSQL and relational model are two models that are very different. Relational model concept store data in the table, which consists of column and row. Each table interconnected by using foreign key (FK) which is an attribute. When the developer wants to consolidate data from all existing table, then the developer must combine a table with another table, through a foreign key that has defined in the first time, so it can certainly be combined data. Nowadays it’s often be problem for a developer, given the massive data growth, with a fairly high degree of scalability that will be very difficult for a developer to provide the required data in a short time. Therefore, NoSQL approach comes as a solution. In NoSQL, data will be stored in the form of documents and data integration will be done using programming language format. Each document can be likened to a programming language object that can be used in applications that are built. So that access to the data can be done efficiently and effectively despite the huge amount of data.

Attractive learning tools can increase the interest of young people or millennial generations, especially for learning conceptual or too theoretical. Pancasila as the basis of the Indonesian nation's life view needs to be understood by the Indonesian people, especially the younger generation. But the way of learning about the Pancasila is currently too theoretical and does not attract young people. Therefore, by making the game that is liked and favorited by young people today is used to study the Pancasila. Through this research the author wants to analyze the factors that can affect learning experience using game-based learning. Researchers use multiple linear regression methods to analyze these factors. The game prototype developed in this study uses the visual novel genre which has an interesting story. There are 101 respondents as samples. The analysis showed that there are two factors that influence game-based learning, namely the gameplay factor and the story of the game. So, it can be concluded that for developing game based learning we need to pay attention to these two factors and through this visual novel prototype game, it can be concluded that the prototype of this game has an interesting game play and a story that is easy to understand. © 2019 The Authors.

In this paper we consider performance analysis of information access in a mobile computing environment. We employ a distributed directory scheme that permits uninterrupted use under disconnected and low bandwidth connections and minimizes invalidation and false sharing. This scheme allows for two invalidation schemes that avoid false sharing, and a mechanism for efficient maintenance of file details. We analyse the performance of the directory scheme in terms of time taken and energy consumed in executing operations such as read/write, connection, disconnection, and hoarding in mobile environments. The directory scheme is employed for facilitating efficient transfer of partially updated files in hierarchical networks. We also investigate quality of service issues related to file accesses in the mobile computing environment discussed in the paper. However, the scheme can be extended to any mobile computing environment. © 1999 Academic Press.",,,,,,,"Buitenwerf, E., Colombo, G., Mitts, H., Wright, P., UMTS: Fixed Network Issues and Design Options (1995) IEEE Personal Communications, pp. 30-37. , February 1995; Dunchamp, D., Fiener, S.K., Maguire G.Q., Jr., Software Technology for Mobile Computing (1991) IEEE Network Magazine, pp. 12-18. , November, 1991; Forman, G.H., Zahorjan, J., The Challenges of Mobile Computing (1994) IEEE Computer, 27 (4), pp. 38-48; Goodman, D.J., Trends in Cellular and Cordless Communications (1991) IEEE Communications Magazine, pp. 31-40. , June 1991; Imielinski, T., Badrinath, B.R., Wireless Computing (1994) Communications of the ACM, 37 (10), pp. 19-28; Kistler, J.J., Satyanarayanan, M., Disconnected Operation in the Coda File System (1992) ACM Transactions on Computer Systems, 10 (1), pp. 3-25; Kumar, M.J., Venkatesh, S., Panchanathan, S., A Distributed Directory Scheme for Information Access in Mobile Computing Environments (1996) IEEE Intl.

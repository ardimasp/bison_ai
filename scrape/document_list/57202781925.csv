Ensuring that correct implementation of business process in each service in SOA environment is quite different than monolithic applications, where each service must be tested independently and jointly, depending on targeted testing scope. With numerous proposed approaches for solving such challenge, this paper reviews some of those approaches to ease readers understanding of what can be done in testing in SOA environment. More specifically, this paper provides review on generic proposed approaches, unit testing, and integration testing approaches as part of quality assurance testing on SOA environment. In summary, the details of testing implementation will differ for each enterprise/organization as each has different set of requirements to satisfy. © 2020 IEEE.","Quality Assurance; Review; Service-oriented architecture; Testing","Application programs; Information management; Information services; Integration testing; Quality assurance; Software design; Business Process; Quality assurance testing; Unit testing; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,"Candea, G., Bucur, S., Zamfir, C., Automated software testing as a service (2010) Proceedings of the 1st ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing, pp. 155-160; Clegg, B.S., Rojas, J.M., Fraser, G., Teaching software testing concepts using a mutation testing game (2017) Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering and Education Track, pp. 33-36; Suma, V., Gopalakrishnan Nair, T., Better defect detection and prevention through improved inspection and testing approach in small and medium scale software industry (2010) International Journal of Productivity and Quality Management; Morris, E., Anderson, W., Bala, S., Carney, D., Morley, J., Place, P., Simanta, S., Testing in service-oriented environments (2010) Carnegie Mellon University; Kumar, A., Singh, M., An empirical study on testing of soa based services (2015) I.

However, with this large advertising expenditure, is it effective in influencing consumer purchasing power. Therefore, this study will examine the success factors influencing consumers' willingness to purchase brand advertised through mobile phone in Indonesia. This study uses quantitative data analysis methods. Data is collected through questionnaires distributed using Google Form. There were 100 respondents who had filled out the questionnaire. Based on the analysis of research questionnaires, the results show that there are two variables that influence purchasing through mobile advertising in Indonesia. They are attitude towards mobile advertising and social influence. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

This is the reason computer security is becoming important. A computer security system should be able to provide some kind of information assurance such as confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity and non-repudiation of data. The method used to help meet the authenticity of information assurance is biometric-based authentication, among others, a two-dimensional (2D) face recognition system, but it can make mistakes in recognition. The intruder is also easier to enter the system if has a photo print from the user's face. To overcome these deficiencies can be use a three-dimensional (3D) face recognition system. This research did three-dimensional (3D) face recognition by not doing 3D face reconstruction. But using face data got from camera ToF i.e. distance, amplitude, and intensity from each image pixel as input data. The hypothesis was face recognition execution speed faster and similar accuracy when compared with research conducted by Zhang and Lu. The algorithm used in this research, is back propagation neural networks algorithm and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Obtained accuracy of 95% and training time of 9728 seconds. Face recognition in this study has a lower accuracy level than previous research but faster face recognition speed. © 2017 IEEE.","2D; 3D; 3D modeling; backpropagation; face recognition; PCA","3D modeling; Authentication; Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Network security; Neural networks; Principal component analysis; Security systems; 3D face reconstruction; Back propagation neural networks; Biometric based authentication; Face recognition systems; Information assurance; Neural networks algorithms; Three-dimensional (3D) faces; Two Dimensional (2 D); Face recognition",,,,,"Nistanto, R.K., (2013) Setahun 40 Juta Konsumen Jadi Korban, , Hacking"".

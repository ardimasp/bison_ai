The research project was expected to produce a pocket-sized book for taxi drivers to allow them to practice English independently. The research project applied the combined approach of quantitative and qualitative methods, and thus depended on numerical and verbal data. The research project examined the numeric data in questionnaire format and showed the frequency and percentages of each given statement. It also examined the verbal data in interview format, and explained the linguistic features. The quantitative results showed that the conversation pattern between a taxi driver and a foreign guest was best represented by six different stages, which consisted of beginning, highway, address searching, external emergency, internal emergency, and apologizing. The qualitative results showed that the English of taxi drivers should use simple sentences, common words, and pronunciation which had a close resemblance with the local language, if possible. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.","Independent english learning; Needs analysis; Taxi drivers",,,,,,"Ary, D., Jacobs, L.C., Razavieh, A., Sorensen, C., (2006) Introduction to Research in Education, , Thomson Wadsworth, USA; Cohen, L., Manion, L., (2000) Research Methods in Education, , Routledge Farmer, London; Connor, U., Upton, T., (2004) Introduction, Discourse in the Professions: Perspectives from Corpus Linguistics, pp. 1-8. , edited by U.

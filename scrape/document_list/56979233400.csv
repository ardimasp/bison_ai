This technology can be applied and used by the user to simplify everyday tasks. One task that user do in everyday life is doing presentation. In most lecturing and presentation sessions, many presentations will be involved by either the students, or lecturer and other people. One method that will be used to help the user is by implementing gyroscope sensors that available on most modern smartphone. This allows the user to navigate and point at any object on presentation slide without doing it manually or help from other tools such as laser pointer. The purpose of this research is to develop a smartphone app based on android to help user, primarily on presentations by using gyroscope sensor. © 2018 IEEE.","Android; Presentations; Sensors","Gyroscopes; Pattern recognition; Sensors; Smartphones; Android; Android smartphone; Gyroscope sensors; Laser pointer; Presentation slides; Presentations; Android (operating system)",,,,,"Phillipi, J.C., Th, W., Smartphones in nursing education (2011) US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health, , Aug; (2018), http://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share, Retrieved April 13, 2018, from statcounter.com; Brubacher, J.S., (1987) Modern Philosophy of Education, , New Delhi: Mc.

It can be used for automatic parking gate or automatic ticketing system. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Genetic Algorithms (GA) in optimizing the number of hidden neurons, learning rate and momentum rate on Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) that is applied to the Automatic Plate Number Recognizer (APNR). Research done by building a GA optimized BPNN (GABPNN) and APNR system using image processing methods, including grayscale conversion, top-hat transformation, binary morphological, Otsu threshold and binary image projection. The tests conducted with backpropagation training and recognition test. The result shows that GA optimized backpropagation neural network requires 2230 epochs in the training process to be convergent, which is 36.83% faster than non-optimal backpropagation neural network, while the accuracy is 1,35% better than non-optimized backpropagation neural network. © 2017 The Authors.

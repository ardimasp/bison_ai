The fanatic fans of Japanese culture which are very dedicated to their Japanese related hobby, such as manga, anime or video games, is growing rapidly in numbers recently. They continually build a lot of communities that share the same interest of Japanese culture; therefore it is increasing interest of Japanese language as well. The purpose of this research is to study about how 'Musou Roman' game can help Japan culture enthusiasts to learn the most complicated Japanese letters, kanji, beside katakana and hiragana letters through gamification. This paper examines the benefit of an RPG (Role-Playing Game) to learn other language and their complicated letters, in this case Japanese kanji. Suggestions for research are made, with particular reference to how gamification, can bridge learning outcomes as well as gameplay experience. This paper will contribute as potential solution to demystification in learning Japanese Kanji. © 2016 IEEE.","Culture; Gamification; Japan; Kanji; Learning; Pop; Role-Playing Game","Cell culture; Interactive computer graphics; Gamification; Japan; Kanji; Learning; Role-playing game; Human computer interaction",,,,,"(2013) Survey Report on Japanese - Language Education Aboard 2012 Excerpt (Rep.), , Tokyo: Kurosio Publisher; Fine, G.A., (1981) Fantasy Games and Designer (Empire of the Petal Throne), 12 (3), pp. 251-279; Matsumoto, K., Kanji recognition by second language learners: Exploring effects of first language writing systems and second language exposure (2013) Mod.

According to Stephen Cavalier (2011), the world history of the animation is divided into five large round that starts from the era before 1900 (The Origin of Animation) to the digital era (after 1986). The study results found, Indonesian animation in the context of five major round of animated world, started in the ’50 s. That year (1950) in the history of animation’s period, entered the era of transition from the golden age of traditional animation (cartoon) to the television era. In a review of the history of animation, the era of the ’50 s was the era of transition half a century’s history of modern animation. Based on these facts actually Indonesian animation has been growing for more than a halft century, but the development of Indonesian animation feels very slow when seen in the context of the world of animation history. Indonesian animation only began to rise again after the digital era of the 2000 s, or at the time of the reform era in the context of Indonesia’s political history. On the other hand, the development of Indonesian animation, particularly animation as a medium of artistic expression (experimental animation) which took a different path from the narrative animated commercial (mainstream animation) has joined in celebrating and gaining recognition in the international animation festivals since the 80 s until 90 s. This path pioneered by academic artists who view an animation from the strong perspective of arts. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Animation; History; Indonesia; Indonesian animation",,,,,,"Bendazzi, G., (1994) Cartoons: One Hundred Years of Cinema Animation, , John Libbey, London; Biran, M.Y., (2009), Sejarah Film; 1900-1950, Komunitas bambu, Depok; Cavalier, S., (2011) The World History of Animation, , University of California Press, California; Harun, A., Rahim, R.A., (2008), Analyzing the first malaysian animated film “Hikayat sang kancil,” Faculty of Art and Design Universiti Teknologi MARA Shah Alam, Malaysia; Linsenmaier, T., (2008) Why Animation Historiography?

The challenge to set a safety stock for MRO materials is uncertainty of demand and lead time especially in industry where the operation plant is far away from materials manufacturer. The correlation is presented between maintenance activities and inventory control strategy to provide acceptable service level through combined the equipment and material criticality with optimum inventory safety stock level by linked the acceptable downtime of equipment with lead time of ordering materials. The result shows the criticality material and equipment is increased the assurance of inventory control to set a service level and incorporated in the safety stock calculation. The contribution of this paper is to find an alternative solution by approaching the criticality of material and equipment. In addition, by using this approach the optimization for maintenance, reliability and operation materials can be determined. Furthermore, this approach also provides satisfactory for both parties, maintenance as receiver of services and inventory control as provider of services. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Criticality; Downtime; Lead time; MTBF; Safety stock",,,,,,"Lee, C.-F., Chung, C.-P., An Inventory Model for Deteriorating Items in a Supply Chain with System Dynamics Analysis (2012) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 40, pp. 41-51; Russell, R.S., Taylor, B.W., III, (2014) Operation and Supply Chain Management, , Singapore: John Wiley & Sons; Heizer, J., Render, B., (2014) Operation Management Sustainability and Supply Chain Management, , Essex: Pearson Education Ltd; Taha, H.A., (2011) Operation Reseach an Introduction, , Pearson Educaton Inc; Groover, M.P., (2016) Automation, Prodution Systems, and Computer Integrated Manufacturing, , Pearson Education Inc; Doyen, L., Gaudon, O., Modeling and Assesment of Aging and Efficiency of Corrective and Planned Preventive Maintenance (2011) IEEE Transactions on Reliability, 60 (4); Mobley, R.K., (2002) An Introduction to Predictive Maintenance, , Butterworth-Heinemann; Wang, Y., Deng, C., Wu, J., Wang, Y., Xiong, Y., A Corrective Maintenance Sceme for Engineering Equipment (2014) Engineering Failure Analysis, 36, pp. 269-283; Ahamed Mohideen, P.B., Ramachandran, M., Strategic Approach to Breakdown Maintenance on Construction Plant-UAE Perspective (2014) Benchmarking An International Journal, 21 (2), pp. 226-252; Jiang, Q., Xing, W., Hou, R., Zhoul, B., An Optimization Model for Inventory System and the Algorithm for the Optimal Inventory Costs Based on Supply-Demand Balance (2015) Mathematical Problems in Engineering; Michalski, G., Inventory management optimization as part of operational risk management (2009) Economic Computation and Economic Cybernetics Studies and Research, 4; Schmidt, M., Hartman, W., Nyhuis, P., Simulation Based Comparison of Safety-Stock Calculation Methods (2012) CIRP Annals-Manufacturing Technology, 61, pp. 403-406; Dekker, R., Kleijn, M.J., De Rooij, P.J., A Spare Parts Stocking Policy Based on Equipment Criticality (1998) Int.

This research is a preliminary study for research that aims to prove the relationship between the use of language and organisational culture in a company. The method used was qualitative research by an in-depth interview with participating employees who work in Japan's creative industry. The object of this research focusses on the use of term of address by staff to superiors. The results show that the 2 (two) companies which are creative industries used ""family name+san"" to address superiors, and used ""family name+professional ranking"" to address the highest superior in the company. This research found that using ""family name+san"" to the superiors brought the relationship between the superiors and subordinates closer. This condition causes the communication to be smoother and the atmosphere to become more relaxed. © 2020 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Creative industry; Form of address; Open system; Organisational culture; Results oriented",,,,,,"Annamalah, S., Raman, M., Marthandan, G., Logeswaran, A.K., Acceptance of Open Innovation Model in Malaysian SMIs (2016) International Journal of Innovation Creativityn and Change, 2 (4), pp. 68-84; Braun, F., (1986) Terms of Address: Problems of Patterns and Usage in Various Languages and Cultures, , De Gruyter; Brown, P., Levinson, S., Politeness: Some Universals in Language Use (1987) Studies in Interactional Sociolinguistics, 4, pp. 55-84; Creswell, J.W., Clark, P.V.L., Creswell, J.W.J.W., Plano Clark, V.L.V.L., Clark, V.L.P.P., Plano Clark, V.L.V.L., Designing and Conducting Mixed Methods Research (2007) Saga; Daft, R.L., Organisation Theory and Design (2010) South Western Cengage Learning; Hanzawa, S., The Japanese animation and home video game industries: Locational patterns, labor markets, and inter-firm relationships (2004) Japanese Journal of Human Geography, 56 (6), pp. 29-44; Hofstede, Cultures and Organisations (2010) Cultures and Organisations; Ide, S., Japanese sociolinguistics politeness and women's language (1982) Lingua, 57 (2-4), pp. 357-385; Ide, S., Yoshida, M., Sociolinguistics: Honorifics and Gender Differences (1999) The Handbook of Japanese Linguistics; Jones, G.R., (2013) Gareth R.

Before educating the society around Binus, who were done by several groups of the students, the students, called The Cleanliness Ambassador Program, must have the values of environmental awareness first. To have the values internalized, the students had to do this project using the SECI (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization) model, to transfer their knowledge about clean environment each other effectively as well as strengthen their teamwork. This study aimed to find the performance of the students while doing the project using the SECI model.

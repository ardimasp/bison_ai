Lecturers in Indonesia often consider that they are underpaid, the existing support systems for research are limited, and academic workloads are excessive. By considering those constraints, we anticipate that the new regulations may alleviate lecturers’ stress level. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the publication obligations on job stress among academic lecturers in Indonesia. We adopt the Job Demand-Control-Support (JDC-S) model that expresses the construct Job Stress and the affecting factors, namely, Job Demand, Job Control, and Job Support. Questionnaires are used to collect the required data for those constructs from a random sample of 100 lecturers in the country. The data are analyzed by using descriptive statistics and multivariate regression analysis, and the findings follow. Those who hold doctoral degree incline to consider the publication demand is low, but for those with master degree, their opinion about the demand spread uniformly from low, average, and high. The participants find it rather hard to control aspects around the responsibility. The supports for publication are considered low, but they do not contribute much in alleviating the stress level. The stress model fits reasonably well to the issue, suggesting Job Demand and Job Control to be the most relevant factors. © 2019 ICIC International","Job control; Job demand; Job stress; Job support; Scientific publication",,,,,,"Figure 4.

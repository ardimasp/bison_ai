The Academic Information System provides valuable raw data. However, unprocessed information alone is insufficient for the diagnosis of problem areas within an education institution. Due to the complex nature of educational management, there is a need for an application that can identify critical patterns and trends within an educational institution's current activities. The data warehouse in the study serves the center for data collection and integration. Gathered data can then be accessed for queries and analysis, generating insights crucial for improving an institution. The purpose of this study was to build a data warehouse model that can display useful information for education management support. The data warehouse design methodology was based on the nine-step methodology proposed by Kimball. The method of data collection included questionnaires, interviews, formal observations, and literature review. Visual Basic.Net 2008, SQL Server 2005 and Crystal Reports were used as tools to design the model. © 2018 IEEE.","data warehouse; education management; model; nine-step methodology","Data warehouses; Information use; Models; Pattern recognition; Surveys; Data collection; Education institutions; Education management; Educational institutions; Educational management; Literature reviews; nine-step methodology; Warehouse design; Data acquisition",,,,,"Pardamean, B., Muljo, H.H., Suparyanto, T., Masli, E., Prabowo, H., Donovan, J.D., Team based learning as an instructional strategy: A comparative study (2017) New Educ.

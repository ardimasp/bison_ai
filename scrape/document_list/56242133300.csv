Higher education information system generates many transactional data; and the amount of those data is increased day by day, but the use of data has not been explored optimally. Each data stored at data storage media is issued for separate purposes. On the other hand, a higher education organization needs to gain overall knowledge from all data. Based on these conditions, organization needs an analytical tool to extract information and discover valuable knowledge from huge amount of data. These processes require more processing time and more complex process. The purpose of this research was to design the data warehouse model and dashboard for analytical tool and use data mining technique for higher education institutions. The research method began with designing the knowledge needs; designing and developing transformation model to data warehouse; using data mining techniques and designing dashboard for analytical tool. The obtained result was the model of data warehouse, data mining and analytical tool for higher education institution that will improve institution's performance, and help them to improve analytical and decision making process. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

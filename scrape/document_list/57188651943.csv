In Indonesia, the integrated timber industry had implemented information systems management in the field of sustainable forest management. Existing information systems developed by IT departments that exist in the company. However, the development of information systems does not have the information systems strategic planning in IT departments. The system development processes no priority system what information should be done. Therefore, it is necessary to make strategic planning of information systems to support and assist the IT team in the process of system development. This study discussed information systems strategic plans using the framework Ward & Peppard. It conducted an internal and external analysis of IS/IT. For the analysis of the company's internal and external analysis need not be performed but was replaced with the existing strategy in the company. Based on this analysis will produce IS strategy, IT strategy, and management strategies in IS/IT. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

This means that there is already a preference for Internet users in terms of using devices from PC and laptop computers to mobile devices. With the development of technology and the transition to mobile, the education sector is also experiencing a change from face-to-face in the classroom (conventional) to online learning. The researcher proposes a prototype of a mobile-based online learning management system (m-LMS) that will be used and adopted by students and lecturers at the nursing academy. The study aims to determine the preferences of prospective nurses in using smartphone devices as m-learning media and specific needs in m-learning learning situations, as well as their opinions on the appropriateness of learning through smartphones. Retrieval of data using interview techniques to students and lecturers at the nursing academy. The sampling technique of this study used simple random sampling. The results obtained were enthusiastic nursing students with online learning via smartphones and the feature most wanted by students was the availability of learning material that could be downloaded and read whenever they needed.

This research is aimed at exploring the effect of consumer confusion towards purchase intention moderated by omni-channel integration. Inspired by the new concept of omni-channel, this study developed a model of consumer confusion to increase purchase intention. Data was collected from a survey of 442 consumers, and SmartPLS was used as a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) tool to analyse data. As a hypothetical development about omni-channel integration as a part of the e-quality service, this study developed three hypotheses. The results of this study showed that e-WOM has a significant impact on (1) consumer confusion, (2) purchase intention mediated by consumer confusion, and (3) purchase intention mediated by consumer confusion and moderated by quality of omni-channel integration quality. The findings of this study differed from those of previous research. The various opinions and information obtained by consumers through e-WOM increased their confusion, and thus made it difficult for them to make purchasing decisions. In Indonesia, consumers were unaware of the excellent omni-channel services, which improved speed and convenience of purchase process. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Consumer confusion; Electronic word of mouth; Omni-channel integration quality; Purchase intention",,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behaviour (1991) Organizational Behaviour and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2); Angel, T.O.S., (2014) A Study of Omni-Channel Retailing: The Impact of Integration Quality on Omni-Satisfaction and Omni-Loyalty in Apparel Retail Business, , http://www.americanbanker.com/issues/179_124/which-city-is-the-next-big-fintech-hub-new-york-stakes-its-claim-1068345-1.html, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

There are different features, methods and techniques of data mining applying performance prediction in online discussion forum from 2011-2016 data. The inclination and the tip from the data help the researcher to analyze the potency of online discussion forum in predicting students' performance. Hence, it becomes a benchmark to find new and meaningful innovations for research, not only in education but also in all aspects of the fields. This paper also provides recommendations for students and educators to give sufficient information to preserve and ameliorate learning process by monitoring the progress of students' performance via prediction tools using data mining. Students' performances are mainly observed to decide the level of students' progress to determine if a student will remain involved or quit the study. Such critical issue is obviously faced by many educational institutions. Hence, performance prediction is obviously important to be applied, not only in educational field but also the others as it avoids the students' reduction potential in educational institutions. In addition, it also improves the students' standard and knack through active engagement. It also helps highly-risked students to recognize the weakness of the study program. © 2018 The Author(s).","educational data mining; online discussion forum; performance prediction; student performance","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Forecasting; Online systems; Social networking (online); Comparative analysis; Educational data mining; Educational institutions; Effective interactions; Online discussion forums; Performance prediction; Student performance; Students' performance; Students",,,,,,"Romero, C., Ventura, S., Educational data mining: A review of the state of the art (2010) Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews, IEEE Transactions On., 40 (6), pp. 601-618; Romero, C., Ventura, S., Espejo, P.G., Data mining algorithms to classify students (2008) Educational Data Mining, , Hervás C, editor; Pradeep, A., Thomas, J., Predicting College Students Dropout using EDM Techniques (2015) International Journal of Computer Applications, 123 (5); Ahmad, F., Ismail, N., Aziz, A., The Prediction of Students' Academic Performance Using Classification Data Mining Techniques (2015) Applied Mathematical Sciences, 9129, pp. 6415-6426; Huebner, R., A survey of Educational Data-Mining Research (2013) Research in Higher Education Journal, , April 19; Bates, A., (2005) Technology, E-learning and Distance Education, , Routledge; Romero, C., Ventura, S., García, E., Data mining in course management systems: Moodle case study and tutorial (2008) Computers & Education, 51 (1), pp. 368-384; Romero, C., Ventura, S., Educational data mining: A survey from 1995 to 2005 (2007) Expert Systems with Applications, 33 (1), pp. 135-146; Baker, R., Yacef, K., The state of educational data mining in 2009: A review and future visions (2009) JEDM-Journal of Educational Data Mining, 5 (1), pp. 3-17; Kabakchieva, D., Predicting student performance by using data mining methods for classification (2013) Cybernetics and Information Technologies, 13 (1), pp. 61-72; El-Halees, A., (2009) Mining Students Data to Analyze E-Learning Behavior: A Case Study, p. 108. , Department of Computer Science, Islamic University of Gaza; Sembiring, S., Zarlis, M., Hartama, D., Ramliana, S., Wani, E., Prediction of student academic performance by an application of data mining techniques (2011) International Conference on Management and Artificial Intelligence; Sundar, P., A Comparative Study for Predicting Student's Academic Performance Using Bayesian Network Classifiers Journal of Engineering (IOSRJEN); Hung, J., Wang, M., Wang, S., Abdelrasoul, M., He, W., Identifying At-Risk Students for Early Interventions?

There were many perceptions about the form of effective online learning resources, which create an interesting teaching and learning process that engage and motivate students to learn. Currently, the most effective learning resources for students in online learning is still being debated. The contribution of this research was to discover the pattern of online learning users' behavior in Indonesia, especially students, find the most suitable and motivating learning resource for students, also improving the ease of learning material understanding. The research data was collected quantitatively using 730 students as a sample of the total 3870 students throughout the participants of online program, at one of a private university in Indonesia. Learning resources packaged in this among others: Lecture Note pdf-text, PowerPoints, Videos and Quizzes. In this paper, text-based has been found has a high role in motivating and facilitating for students to understand the material. The students believed both the learning resources have a relevance to the topics that covered in their courses, so that both learning resources become the main source of learning for students. Students regarded videos as additional resources, because it takes longer to understand the material in this type of sources. © 2017 IEEE.","Distance Education; Learning Management Systems (LMS); Learning Resources; Online Learning","Computer aided instruction; Distance education; E-learning; Motivation; Online systems; Students; Teaching; Efficient learning; Learning management system; Learning materials; Learning resource; Online learning; Online learning resources; Online learning tools; Teaching and learning; Education",,,,,,"Vaghela, C., Web based learning: An upliftment approach for the excellence of education (2016) Langlit: An International Peer-Reviewed Open Access Journal, 2 (3), pp. 748-756; Castellani, J.D., Universal accessibility and the design of digital educational materials (2000) Virginia Society for Technology in Education, 14 (3), pp. 4-7; Owston, R.D., The world wide web: A technology to enhance teaching and learning?

It can be used to encourage students to complete activities assigned by teachers such as assignment and quiz posting, polls conducting, badges awarding, learning materials uploading, classroom discussions, grade tracking, and comments writing besides as personal digital library connected to Google drive, OneDrive, and much more. Accordingly, this paper provided a general overview of how students in class IX to XII of technology information and communication course fully participate in Edmodo. The main beneficial point of this research was the trend and analysis of K-12 students' participation at high school in Indonesia. Investigating the participation and factors underlying the students' patterns of behavior in Edmodo can provide guidelines for sustainable improvement of online learning management systems. The data analysis revealed that a high number of students join as members in Edmodo and only a few of them were not engaged due to limited access of internet. It was found that most of students in class XII-IPA were active in posting their assignments through Edmodo after school and that most dominant is class X. There were some discussions and sharing information between teacher-students and students-students related to the inside and outside classroom activities. The result also indicated that students in class XII were more active than those in class IX, X, and XI. Students of class XII are in the final year before joining universities. Thus, they were more serious about their study. Furthermore, the students found Edmodo as a communication tool and a user-friendly social learning platform enabling them to connect with classmates and teachers in online class. The results also inspired teachers to motivate and encourage the students' to do their best in the study and build a strong relationship inside and outside the class. © 2017 IEEE.","Collaboration; Edmodo; Interaction; Motivation; Online learning tools","Digital libraries; Digital storage; E-learning; Motivation; Online systems; Social networking (online); Students; Teaching; Collaboration; Edmodo; Information and communication; Interaction; Online learning tools; Personal digital library; Social Network Sites; Sustainable improvement; Education",,,,,,"Borg, N., Edmodo: A facebook for schools (2012) Chalks up API to Become Classroom Platform: Fastcompany, , http://www.fastcompany.com/1822900/edmodo-facebook-schoolschalks-api-become-classroom-platform; Marshall, P.L., Moodle as a data portal in a study of cultural relevance in K-2 mathematics (2013) The Educational Forum, , Taylor & Francis; Iglesias-Pradas, S., Ruiz-De-Azcárate, C., Agudo-Peregrina, A.F., Assessing the suitability of student interactions from Moodle data logs as predictors of cross-curricular competencies (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, 47, pp. 81-89; Cacatian, C.T.M., Francisco, M.R.C., Jamandra, A.J.T., Manabat, K.J.C., Caro, J.D., Use of analytics to improve student behavior and performance in an online course implementation (2015) Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications (IISA), , IEEE; Wang, M.-J., Online collaboration and offline interaction between students using asynchronous tools in blended learning (2010) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 26 (6); Al-Ani, W.T., Blended learning approach using moodle and student's achievement at sultan qaboos university in Oman (2013) Journal of Education and Learning, 2 (3), p. 96; Zraki, M.D., Markovi, A., Bogdanovi, Z., Bara, D., Kro, S., Providing adaptivity in Moodle LMS courses (2012) Educational Technology & Society, 15 (1), pp. 326-338; Paynter, M., Bruce, N., (2012) Case Studies: Using Moodle for Collaborative Learning with University and Senior Secondary Students; Vighnarajah, W.S.L., Bakar, K.A., Considerations of Design and Development Aspects of Collaborative Technologies to Facilitate Ideas on Open Learning; Moisseeva, M., Steinbeck, R., Seufert, S., (2007) Online Learning Communities and Collaborative Learning, , http://www.iienetwork.org/?p=41543, Available from; Mokhtar, F.A., Dzakiria, H., Illuminating the potential of Edmodo as an interactive virtual learning platform for English Language learning and teaching (2015) Malaysian Journal of Distance Education; Hankins, S.N., (2015) The Effects of Ed Modo on Student Achievement in Middle School, , St. Thomas University; Balasubramanian, K., Jaykumar, V., Fukey, L.N., A study on Student preference towards the use of Edmodo as a learning platform to create responsible learning environment (2014) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 144, pp. 416-422; Yagci, T., Blended learning via mobile social media & Implementation of EDMODO in reading classes (2015) Advances in Language and Literary Studies, 6 (4), pp. 41-47; Bonk, C.G., (2005) The Handbook of Blended Learning: Global Perspectives, Local Designs; Novo-Corti, I., Varela-Candamio, L., Ramil-Díaz, M., E-learning and face to face mixed methodology: Evaluating effectiveness of e-learning and perceived satisfaction for a microeconomic course using the Moodle platform (2013) Computers in Human Behavior, 29 (2), pp. 410-415; Nurhidayanti, R., (2015) The Impact of Labeling in Science and Social Major on Deviation among the Students in SMA Negeri 2 Bandung, , repositoryupiedu",,,"BK21 Plus Project, University of Ulsan;University of Ulsan","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","10th International Conference on Human System Interactions, HSI 2017","17 July 2017 through 19 July 2017",,129837,,9781509046881,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

This research was conducted on customers in Jakarta. Data were collected from a sample of 100 respondents. The data were analyzed using path analysis. The result of this study found that e-marketing did not affect the e-satisfaction. E-marketing and e-service quality had an influence on e-satisfaction. E-satisfaction had an influence on e-loyalty. E-marketing and e-service did not influence e-loyalty. Based on the results of this study, we suggested that hotels should develop their website with interesting and detailed features for e-marketing and also provide live chat service for increasing e-service quality. E-satisfaction can be supported by customer satisfaction surveys on a regular basis or to be a part of the standard operating procedure, whereas customer loyalty programs need to be developed in the near future to build customers' e-loyalty. © 2016 IEEE.","e-loyalty; E-marketing; e-satisfaction; e-service quality","Commerce; Marketing; Publishing; Quality of service; Regression analysis; Sales; Customer loyalty programs; Customer satisfaction survey; E-loyalty; E-marketing; E-satisfaction; E-service quality; Hospitality industry; Standard operating procedures; Customer satisfaction",,,,,,"Central Bureau of Statistics Number of Star and Non-star Hotels in Indonesia during 2010-2014, , http://www.bps.go.id/index.php/publikasi/1121, Online Available; Amstrong, G., Kotler, P., (2015) Marketing: An Introduction, , 12th ed.

The research aimed to apply a consumer decision-making model to specific shopping styles involving apparel. It also examined specific shopping pattern differences between selected university students. This study analyzed the effect of seven factors: brand, quality, recreation, confusion, fashion, impulse, and price consciousness. It adopted the revised scale of Consumer Style Inventory (CSI). Faculty, gender, college classification, and interaction were compared, based on four hypotheses, to determine if any significance existed among the seven factors. There were 152 computer science college students and 76 social science college students from a total of 232 samples were usable data. The research questions were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, ANOVA, MANOVA, and mean comparisons. As a result, computer science consumers and social science college-aged consumers demonstrated different shopping patterns. Moreover, difference shopping pattern between male and female was revealed about on quality, confusion, price, and brand consciousness. There are no statistically significant differences in quality, recreation, confusion, fashion, impulse, price, and brand consciousness about college classifications. Finally, in the interaction tests among faculty, gender, and college-aged classifications, there was an interaction between faculty and gender on fashion consciousness. © 2017 ACM.","Clothing; Consumer; Online; Shopping","Behavioral research; Costs; Decision making; Developing countries; Education; Education computing; Marketing; Social sciences; Clothing; Consumer; Consumer decision making; Descriptive statistics; Online; Shopping; Statistically significant difference; University students; Students",,,,,,"Kalyani, P., Online Shopping Trends, People Purchasing Power, their Choices and Preferences: An Indicative Study for Online Shopping Trends in Tire-2/Tire-3 City with Special Reference to Ajmer (2016) Journal of Management, Engineering and Information Technology (JMEIT), 3 (4), pp. 29-47. , Aug 2016; Kotler, P., Amstrong, G., (2012) Principles of Marketing, Fourteenth, , New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc; Nielsen, (2014) E-commerce: Evolution or Revolution in the Fastmoving Consumer Goods World, pp. 1-21. , August; Song, S.S., Kim, M., Does more mean better An Examination of Visual Product Presentation in E-Retailing (2012) J.

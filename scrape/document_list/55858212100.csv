To be effective, healthcare facilities are mandated to adopt knowledge management in the organization along with the support of the organizational structure and organizational culture within the organization. A private hospital in Tangerang is an example of the healthcare organization with a strong shared-value of professionalism, team-work, empathy, and love within the organization that has become their culture. This private hospital has implemented the knowledge management system and also has its organizational structure changed to be decentralized. Thus, this research aims to find the effect of implementing knowledge management and decentralization on organizational effectiveness which remains unknown. This research used quantitative research methodology in collecting and analyzing data by using SEM-PLS as data analyzing tool. This research conducted at the private hospital in Tangerang with a population of 300 system users. the sampling method used was non-probability purposive sampling. The sample size was determined using Slovin's formula.

This study uses a quantitative approach with an explanatory design in accordance with the focus of the study, the population in this study is all e-wallet users in Indonesia. The sample selection uses a non-probability sampling method and a sample of 143 e-wallet users is used. The minimum number of samples is determined based on the number of research indicators. The method used in this study is multiple linear regression models with the help of the SPSS program. The results showed that trust and promotion partially had a significant effect on intention to use e-wallet. However, social influence does not significantly influence the intention to use e-wallet. For this reason it is suggested to the management to pay attention to these factors, by maintaining trust, paying attention to social factors and increasing promotion, it will have an impact on increasing intention to use e-wallets. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

This change requires a simple guide on how to deal with hoaxes and solutions. This research is a development of previously published journals: The Development and Implementation of Wise Netizens (E-Comment) in Indonesia; Developing Framework Intelligence (CI3) Inside Using Social Media Johari Window Methods; Developing 'Framework Leadership Intelligence (CI2)' Inside Social Media to Develop an Ethical Leader using the Johari Window Method. The problems that exist in social media are lies which rose directly and indirectly; information contains 'half-truth'; 'information but not enough knowledge'; and 'lie for good'. Furthermore, the methods for the research: Johari window and Ken Watanabe-Problem solving, which are two methods for dealing with hoax problems. The end result of this research is a formula and a guide to dealing with hoaxes. Moreover, this research still has to go through several stages of development and will produce a complete guide to dealing with hoaxes and problems found on social media. Therefore, this research requires more in-depth data and surveys; researchers will continue to carry out observations, surveys, and data collection until the research can create an appropriate formula in overcoming all problems in social media. © 2019 IEEE.","Comment; Critics; Hoax; Johari Window; Ken Watanabe-problem solving; Social media","Surveys; Comment; Critics; Data collection; Hoax; Human lives; In-depth datum; Social media; Window methods; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Wahjuwibowo, I.S., Hereyah, Y., How to manage social media hoaxes Indiwan Seto Wahjuwibowo & Yoyoh Hereyah (2016) 2nd International Conference on Corporate and Marketing Communication (ICCOMAC), 5 (2), pp. 16-27; Shu, K., Mahudeswaran, D., Wang, S., Lee, D., Liu, H., (2019) FakeNewsNet: A Data Repository with News Content, Social Context and Spatiotemporal Information for Studying Fake News on Social Media; Krombholz, K., Merkl, D., Weippl, E., Fake identities in social media: A case study on the sustainability of the facebook business model (2012) J.

However, the research on the phenomenon of applying social media marketing to museums has been investigated by international researchers, but has never been done by researchers in Indonesia. This study has a focus on testing whether the Museum Facebook Fan Page User Experience is a mediator or moderator variable between user motivations and user expectations of intention to use Facebook Museum Fan page and whether the online community involvement moderates the relation between the Facebook Fan Page usage intention to the visit museum intention. The research design is the quantitative approach. Data was collected using a questionnaire distributed to followers of the museum Facebook Fan Page in Indonesia. The researchers was randomly select the museum Facebook Fan Page and online cultural community Facebook groups in Indonesia. The sample size was 270 respondents. The data analysis is the Structural Equation Modeling analysis method using AMOS Ver. 22. In this study, eight hypotheses are accepted and one hypothesis is rejected. The r2 of the Facebook Fan Page usage intention is 0.446, it means that the variable can be explained by user expectations, user motivations, and Facebook Fan Page User Experience. The r2 of the visit museum intention is 0.350, it means that the variable can be explained by the Facebook Fan Page User Experience and online community involvement. The contribution of this research is to contribute the Facebook Adoption model that accommodates the Facebook Fan Page usage experience and the online community involvement for marketing and cultural education in the Museum industry in Indonesia. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Facebook Fan Page User Experience; Online Community Involvement; The Facebook Fan Page Usage Intention; The Visit Museum Intention; User Expectations; User Motivations",,,,,,"(2016) Slideshare: Global Digital Statistics for 2016, , http://www.digitalbuzzblog.com/slideshareglobal-digital-statistics-report-for-2016, [Accessed: 07-Jun-2016]; Utama, I.G.B.R., Mengelola Warisan Budaya Sebagai Produk Pariwisata (2015) Researchgate, , http://www.yayasankertagama.org/article/article3.pdf, [Accessed: 13-Mar-2017]; UNESCO, (2008) Towards Sustainable Strategies for Creative Tourism; (2017) Tentang Pemajuan Kebudayaan. 2017; Wulandari, A.A.A., Fajarwati, A.A.S., Latif, F., The Relationship of Exhibition Space Design and the Success of Delivering Messages to Museum Visitors in Jakarta (2017) Humaniora, 8 (3), p. 219. , Oct; Sulistiyana, R.T., Hamid, D., Azizah, D.F., Pengaruh Fasilitas Wisata dan Harga Terhadap Kepuasan Konsumen (Studi pada Museum Satwa) (2015) J.

The data was collected from a sample of 63 respondents using a questionnaire using purposive sampling. The data was analyzed using descriptive analysis. The results were most of the social media users are in the productive age who have minimum, an undergraduate education, and most of them live in Java. They are not visiting the museum frequently, and their visiting purposes are to learn or study about Indonesia culture triggered by their school, relaxing, personal desires, and visit by accident. They know information about museum from the search engine, offline, and social media. Most of museum in Indonesia give bad experience to their visitor, and only some give positive experience. The limited social media users in Indonesia, who already aware of museum presence in social media, utilize it to get information about the museum (profile, exhibition, collection, and news), socializing with other social media members, and showing their existence in society. They suggest that museum management should update their social media frequently. © 2018 IEEE.","edutainment marketing; Indonesia museum; museum social media; online visitor behavior; online visitor expectation","Information management; Museums; Search engines; Social networking (online); Edutainment; Indonesia; online visitor expectation; Social media; Visitor behaviors; Exhibitions",,,,,"Hassan, A.I., (2015) The Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report, , World Economic Forum 2015; Isacsson, U., Annica, Gretzel, Facebook as an edutainment medium to engage students in sustainability and tourism (2011) J.

The goal makes the page look more attractive in general. The conclusions obtained from this study suggest that not all museums utilized the Facebook Fan Page for developing the electronic word of mouth. There is a need for the identification and development of best practice in this domain so that museums management apply electronic word of mouth. The implementation of best practice can attract people to visit the museum based on appropriate benchmark for assessing and comparing their performance. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Electronic word of mouth; Facebook; Hausmann analytical framework; Museum awareness; Social media marketing",,,,,,"(2010) Undang-Undang No 11 Tahun 2010 Tentang Cagar Budaya; Dan Kebudayaan, K.P., Laporan Kinerja Kementerian Pendidikan Dan Kebudayaan 2015, , Jakarta, 2016; Cheung, C.M.K., Thadani, D.R., The impact of electronic word-of-mouth communication: A literature analysis and integrative model (2012) Decis.

The growing presence of social media allows the opportunity for the branding and marketing of the non-profit organization with limited resources but demand high impact. Museum industry in Indonesia needs to preserve and communicate their culture to the public with limited financial and human resources. Social media was proven to solve this problem. The data was collected from a sample of 63 respondents using a questionnaire. The data were analyzed using descriptive analysis. The results were most of the social media users are in the productive age who have the minimum an undergraduate education, and most of them live in Java. They are not visiting the museum frequently, and their visiting purposes are to learn or study about Indonesia culture triggered by their school, relaxing, personal desires, and visit by accident. They know information about the museum from the search engine, offline, and social media. Most of the museum in Indonesia give bad experience to their visitor, and only some offer a positive experience. The limited social media users in Indonesia, who already aware of museum presence in social media, utilize it to get information about the museum (profile, exhibition, collection, and news), socializing with other social media members, and showing their existence in society. They suggest that museum management should update their social media frequently. This study examines the characteristics of Facebook Fan Page Museum user (age group, gender, residence location, and education level) and their behavior in using Facebook Fan Page Museum. Since there is no research in this field in Indonesia, the findings can be used by museum managers for managing their social media in marketing and education for the community. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Edutainment Marketing; Indonesia Museum; Museum Social Media; Online Visitor Behavior; Online Visitor Expectation",,,,,,"Hassan, A.I., Crotti, R., El Hassan, G., Haddad, C., Jain, C., Le Quesne, K., Misrah, T., Segal, H., The Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2015 (2015) World Economic Forum; Isacsson, U., Facebook as an Edutainment Medium to Engage Students in Sustainability and Tourism (2011) J.

OJS is an open-source journal management platform that provides a streamlined journal publishing workflow. TextRank is an unsupervised, graph-based ranking model commonly used as extractive auto summarization of text documents. This study applies the TextRank algorithm to summarize 50 article reviews from an OJS-based international journal. The resulting summaries are formed using the most representative sentences extracted from the reviews. The summaries are then used to help OJS editors in assessing a review's quality. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Graphic methods; Information services; Publishing; Graph based rankings; International journals; Journal publishing; Management platforms; Open sources; Text document; Reviews",,,,,"Edgar, B.D., Willinsky, J., A survey of the scholarly journals using Open Journal Systems (2010) Sch.

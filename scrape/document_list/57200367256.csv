But the increasing population is not supported by the provision of adequate housing facilities for them. Most of the elderly house in Jakarta, is designed just like for common people without relizing thatthey had physical and mentally degradation following the age. Therefore, the elderly house need to design with special attention to their daily activity mobility which applied in effective room configuration. The connectivity between the activities is most important element to order the room configuration. This research conduct to search the room configuration in elderly house which can improve their productivity and live quality by using the space syntax theory. The research methods by using the syntactic plug-in in Grasshooper software and analyse the integration, choice, control value and entrophy in the activity configuration. The result show that the effective and efficient for elderly house is cluster centralized pattern. The lobby and reception take the important role as the integration aspect and the spatial awareness according to elderly activity. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","cluster centralized pattern; elderly house; room configuration; space syntax","Houses; Housing; cluster centralized pattern; Control values; Daily activity; room configuration; Space configuration; Space syntax; Space syntax theory; Spatial awareness; Syntactics",,,,,"(2013) Overview of Elderly Health in Indonesia, , Data and Information Center Ministry of Health Republic of Indonesia, (Jakarta: Ministry of Health); (2011) Strategic Housing for Older People, , Association of Directors of Adult Social Services ADASS; Wardhana, M., (2007) Logic of Space Configuration and Aspects of Space Psychology for Elderly, 4, pp. 1-16. , (Surabaya: Journal of Engineering Planning / ITS); Hiller, B., Spatial Sustainability in Cities: Organic Patterns and Sustainable Forms (2009) Proceedings of the 7th International Space Syntax Symposium, p.

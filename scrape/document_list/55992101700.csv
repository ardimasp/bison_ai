In order to serve these functions, the suspension needs several components to be assembled as a complete motorcycle unit. Before implementing QFDVA, the company had over budgeted several related components used to isolate the unit form noise, which is preceively top priority by customer, on IDR 217,569. After implementing QFDVA, the company has found that in order to isolate the unit form noise, it shall lower its budget on those related components to IDR 194,817 or about 12% from its original budget. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Quality function deployment and value added (QFDVA); Voice of customer",,,,,,"(2012) Penjualan Motor Meningkat di Awal 2012, , http://oto.detik.com/read/2012/02/07/183049/1836681/1208/ penjualan-motor-meningkat-di-awal-2012, Published 7 Feb 2012.

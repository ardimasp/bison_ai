However, reportedly compared to other settings in the country, transgender women in Yogyakarta have a good access to the HIV-related health services. This study aimed to explore perceptions among transgender women living with HIV, locally known as waria, of factors supportive of their access to the services in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. A qualitative inquiry using in-depth interview method was conducted from December 2017 to February 2018 to collect the data from a selection of waria living with HIV (n = 29) recruited using both purposive and snowball sampling techniques. Data analysis employed a thematic approach which was guided by the framework analysis for qualitative data. The findings indicated several health service system-related determinants supportive of waria’s access to HIV/AIDS-related health services. These included the availability of the services, the simplicity and convenience of accessibility to the services and the comfort felt by the participants while accessing the services. Health professionals’ positive attitudes during healthcare provision, social relationships between waria and health professionals, proximity to healthcare facilities, free access to the services, and information sessions on HIV infection and prevention were also reported to enable participants’ access to the services. These findings call to efforts and strengthening of HIV health service system to support and provide equal access to HIV/AIDS-related services including to all Indonesians living with HIV, but more so for transgender women and other high-risk groups such as sex workers and their clients and men who have sex with men. © 2019 Fauk et al.

Despite their popularity, the MOOC participation rate in Indonesia is still very low. In addition, little is known about the adoption of MOOCs in Indonesia. This study explored MOOC adoption in Indonesia by investigating attitudes, awareness and the experience of working adults in Indonesia with MOOCs. Data was collected from 85 respondents, with 31 respondents having some experience with MOOCs. It was found that although the respondents generally had positive attitudes towards MOOCs, many of them were not familiar with MOOCs. The respondents who were familiar with MOOCs mostly held professions in the information technology and education fields. Lastly, MOOC users highlighted time management and commitment as the two most important factors which determined successful participation in a MOOC. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Distance learning; MOOCs; Qualitative study; Success factors; Technology adoption","Computer applications; Computer programming; Exploratory studies; Massive open online course; MOOCs; Participation rate; Qualitative study; Success factors; Technology adoption; Technology and educations; Distance education",,,,,,"(2018) Definition of MOOC in English, , https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/MOOC; Alraimi, K.M., Zo, H., Ciganek, A.P., Understanding the MOOCs continuance: The role of openness and reputation (2015) Computers & Education, 80, pp. 28-38. , Jan. 2015; Liyanagunawardena, T.R., Adams, A.A., Williams, S.A., MOOCs: A systematic study of the published literature 2008-2012 (2013) The Int.

A qualitative inquiry employing in-depth one-on-one interviews was carried out with 24 MSM participants in July 2015. Data were analysed using a framework analysis and guided by the Social Networks Theory (SNT) as a conceptual framework. Findings indicated that prohibitive cultural perspectives and norms against same-sex marriage made them to conceal their sexual orientation and thus secretively engaging in unprotected sex that increased their predisposition to HIV transmission. The prohibitive cultures were also instrumental in the formation of MSM sexual networks that provided supportive environment for HIV-risky sexual practices among network partners. These findings provide information that can be used to improve HIV/AIDS service practices and policies. However, further studies with large numbers of MSM would be needed to improve the understanding of other HIV vulnerability determinants, the unique needs of MSM, and what and how programs could be conducted to reduce HIV vulnerability among MSM population. © 2017 Fauk et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"clinical article; conceptual framework; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Indonesia; interview; male; men who have sex with men; nonhuman; same-sex marriage; sexual orientation; sexual practice; social network; unprotected sex; adult; cultural anthropology; high risk behavior; HIV Infections; Indonesia; male homosexuality; middle aged; prejudice; psychology; questionnaire; sexuality; social network; social support; unsafe sex; vulnerable population; Adult; Culture; HIV Infections; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Middle Aged; Prejudice; Risk-Taking; Sexual Partners; Social Networking; Social Support; Surveys and Questionnaires; Unsafe Sex; Vulnerable Populations",,,,,,"Fact Sheet: Global HIV Statistics: Joint Unated Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, , http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/global-AIDS-update-2016_en.pdf2016, Geneva, Switzerland; Kementrian Kesehatan, R.I., Laporan Situasi Perkembangan HIV/AIDS di Indonesia Tahun 2016, , http://www.aidsindonesia.or.id/2017, Jakarta, Indonesia: Kementrian Kesehatan RI; Fauk, N.K., Mwanri, L., Inequalities in addressing the HIV epidemi: The story of the Indonesia Ojek community (2015) Int J Hum Rights Healthcare, 8 (3), pp. 144-159; (2010) Population of Indonesia by Province, , http://www.bps.go.id/linkTabelStatis/view/id/1267, Jakarta, Indonesia: Badan Pusat Statistik;, cited 2016 27 January; Pisani, E., Girault, P., Gultom, M., Sukartini, N., Mustiwatik, E.D., Jazan, J., HIV, syphilis infection, and sexual practices among transgenders, male sex workers, and other men who have sex with men in Jakarta, Indonesia (2004) Sex Transm Infect, 80, pp. 536-540. , https://doi.org/10.1136/sti.2003.007500, 15572631; Fauk, N.K., Lau, F., Fernandez, G.M.B., Tetik, F.S., Seran, D., (2008) HIV/AIDS, PMS Dan Masyarakat Kita, , Kupang, Indonesia: Gita Kasih; Morineau, G., Nugrahini, N., Nurhayati, R.P., Girault, P., Mustikawati, E.D., Magnani, R., Sexual risk taking, STI and HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men in six Indonesian cities (2011) AIDS Behav, 15, pp. 1033-1044. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-009-9590-6, 19641986; Prasetyo, A.A., Ariapramuda, E.R., Al-Kindi, E., Dirgahayu, P., Sari, Y., Dharmawan, R., Men having sex with men in surakarta, Indonesia: Demographics, behavioral characteristics and prevalence of blood borne pathogens (2014) Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health, 45 (5), pp. 1032-1047. , 25417504; Data Kasus HIV AIDS DIY S/d Maret 2016, , http://aidsyogya.or.id/2016/datahivaids/data-kasus-hiv-aids-diy-sd-maret-2016/2016, Yogyakarta, Indonesia: Komisi Penanggulangan AIDS Propinsi Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta; Torres, L.H., Delonga, K., Lee, S., Gladstone, A.K., Barrad, A., Huckaby, S., Sociocontextual factors: Moving beyond individual determinants of sexual risk behavior among gay and bisexual adolescent males (2013) J LGBT Youth, 10 (3), pp. 173-185; El-Sayed, N., Darwish, A., El-Geeneidy, M., Mehrez, M., (1994) Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice of Homosexuals Regarding HIV in Egypt, , National AIDS Program.

High numbers of AIDS-orphaned children aged below 18years in Mbeya Region have led to increasing the burden of families caring for them. Understanding the coping strategies and impact mitigation activities employed by adoptive families is important in order to develop programmes to help them. Methods: This study employed a qualitative method for data collection (one-on-one in-depth interviews). The respondents included 12 male and 8 female heads of families that provide essential care for AIDS-orphaned children in Mbeya Rural District in Tanzania. The framework approach was used to analyse the data that were collected from 15 July to 15 August 2010. Results: The study findings revealed that adoptive families faced several challenges including financial constraints due to increased needs for basic essentials such as health care expenses, school fees and food. Further impacts on adoptive families included shortage of work opportunities and limited time to address these challenges. To mitigate these challenges, adoptive families employed a range of coping strategies including selling family assets and renting out parts of cultivable land for extra cash. Task reallocation which involved the AIDS-orphaned children entering the labour force was also employed as a strategy to mitigate challenges and involved de-enrolling of children from schools so they could take part in income-generating activities in order to earn supplementary family income. The creation of additional income-generating activities such as poultry farming were other coping mechanisms employed, and these received support from both non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and governmental organisations, including the Isangati Agricultural Development Organization (local NGO) and the local government respectively. Conclusions: The current study identified challenges that adoptive families as well as the AIDS-orphaned children themselves faced in Mbeya Rural District, Tanzania. Recognition of these issues highlights the need for targeted interventions to address the underlying social determinants of human immunodeficiency virus or HIV and AIDS in affected populations in order to prevent further imposition of social, cultural and economic disadvantages on families that provide care for AIDS-orphaned children and the children themselves. These findings may prove useful in provoking discussions that may lead to HIV/AIDS prevention and the development of broader mitigation strategies to alleviate the impact of this scourge on families and communities in rural Tanzania, and in similar settings across the world. © 2017 The Author(s).","Adoptive families; AIDS; AIDS-orphaned children; Coping strategies; HIV; Mbeya Rural District; Tanzania","acquired immune deficiency syndrome; adoption; adult; Article; child; child care; conceptual framework; family coping; family income; family study; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; male; normal human; orphaned child; priority journal; rural area; school; social determinants of health; socioeconomics; Tanzania; young adult; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; adolescent; adoption; aged; family size; financial management; health service; infant; middle aged; preschool child; psychology; rural population; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Adolescent; Adoption; Aged; Child; Child, Orphaned; Child, Preschool; Family Characteristics; Female; Financial Management; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Rural Population; Tanzania",,,,,,"The state of the world's children 2015: executive summary (2015), http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/SOWC_2015_Summary_and_Tables.pdf, New York: The United Nations Children's Emergency Fund Avalabel at Accessed 28 Apr 2015; (2016) UNICEF data: monitoring the situation of children and women, , http://data.unicef.org/hiv-aids/care-support.html, New York: The United Nations Children's Emergency Fund Available at Accessed 28 Apr 2015; (2003) Africa's Orphaned Generations, , http://www.unicef.org/sowc06/pdfs/africas_orphans.pdf, New York: UNICEF Accessed 28 Apr 2015; (2002) Children on the brink 2002: a joint report on orphan estimatesand program strategies, TvT associates/the synergy projectfor USAID, , http://data.unaids.org/topics/young-people/childrenonthebrink_en.pdf, Washington, D.C.: United States Agency for International Development Accessed Apr 2015; Children and HIV/AIDS: key statistics (2012), www.stephenlewisfoundation.org/, Accessed 28 Apr 2015; (2013) Tanzania HIV/AIDS and malaria indicator survey 2011-12: key findings, , http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/SR196/SR196.pdf, Dar es Salaam: Tanzania Commission for AIDS Accessed 28 Apr 2015; (2007) Follow up and assessment report on HIV and AIDS in Mbeya region, , https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10281050, Tanzania: Tanzania Commission for AIDS Accessed 28 Apr 2015; Tanzania Third National Multi-Sectoral Strategic Framework for HIV/AIDS (2013/14 - 2017/18) (2013) Tanzania: Prime Minister's Office, , http://www.stigmaindex.org/sites/default/files/reports/Tanzania%20NMSF%20%20III%20MASTER%20FINAL%20DRAFT%209%20%20DOCUMENT%2004%20JULY%202013.pdf, Accessed 28 Apr 2015; National HIV and AIDS response report (2014) Tanzania: Tanzania Commission for AIDS, , http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/country/documents/TZA_narrative_report_2014.pdf, Accessed 28 Apr 2015; The HIV epidemic in Tnazania mainland: where have we come from, where is it going, and how are we responding Tanzania (2008) The United Nations HIV and AIDS Country office and Tanzania Commission for AIDS, , http://ihi.eprints.org/1345/, Accessed 22 May 2015; HIV and AIDS estimates (2013) Tanzania: The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS, , http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/unitedrepublicoftanzania, Available at Accessed 22 May 2015; Davidson, T., (2008) Reaching Orphans and the Most Vulnerable Children in Tanzania: What is Working Capstone Collection, p. 716. , http://digitalcollections.sit.edu/capstones/716, Available at Accessed 1 July 2010; Evans, R., Social networks, migration, and care in Tanzania (2005) J Child Poverty, 11 (2), pp. 111-129; Baum, F., (2008) The new public health, , 3rd ed.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative inquiry employing one-on-one in-depth interviews was conducted in 2015. Purposive sampling technique was used to recruit participants (n=24) comprising 20 heads of families caring for AIDS-orphaned children, two local government staff and two staff from Isangati Agricultural Development Organisation – a non-government organisation. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic and framework approach. Findings: Results demonstrated that families caring for AIDS-orphaned children experienced severe socio-economic impacts of the epidemic. Reduction in household savings, increase in living expenses on health care and increased education fees were the identified economic impacts on these families. Social impacts included labour shortage, withdrawal of children from school and increased demand for food. Social implications: There is a need for urgent responses and for scaling up programmes delivered by organisations, institutions and the government of Tanzania to help families cope with these impacts. Originality/value: This study provides evidence on socio-economic impacts of AIDS on families caring for AIDS-orphaned children in Tanzania. An understanding of these impacts can help governmental and non-governmental institutions and programme planners to address the problem in their policies and develop evidence-based strategies and interventions in responding to the problem in Mbeya and Tanzania. Moreover, responses to reducing the impacts of AIDS on families require a holistic approach that encourages the involvement of all sectors and agents outside of the health sector. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","AIDS;

Teamwork is always the essential part of innovation in organisation; in other words, good teamwork is an important ingredient in achieving innovation. In higher education institutions, many strategies have been implemented to achieve innovation. This paper uses the Team Quality Construct (TWQ) from Hoegl and Gemuenden (2001), which highlights several factors namely, communication, mutual support and balance between member contributions, coordination, effort and cohesion as being other essential qualities for the generation of innovation. In addition, this paper examines the relationship between teamwork and innovation by using TWQ and the Innovation Competency Development (INCODE) assessment at BINUS University International. INCODE is a form of assessment that has been implemented in BINUS' Project Hatchery classes for first-semester students from diverse academic backgrounds. The results of the study have signified the role of teamwork as a construct that influences innovation significantly. The study showed that there were no differences in respondents' perception of teamwork among students enrolled in different programmes included in the sample population.

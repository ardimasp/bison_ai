In this paper, illumination is the issue of segmenting various objects. This work proposed and evaluated two methods for image segmentation. First, we proposed region growing based method to find region that represented object of interest. Second, we proposed edge suppressing based method by the use of analyzing tensor. The experiment demonstrated that region growing method has limitation in image segmentation for object color variation. The system shows effectiveness of the method by implementing edge suppressing method in three different objects as foreground object, and four different objects as background object. Using edge suppressing, this system performed successfully under different illumination intensities. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Color; Edge suppressing; Illumination; Region growing; Segmentation",,,,,,"Acharjya, P., Das, R., Ghoshal, D., Study and Comparison of Different Edge Detectors for Image Segmentation (2012) Global Journal of Computer Science and Technology Graphic and Vision, 12, pp. 29-32; Agrawal, A., Raskar, R., Chellapa, R., Edge Suppressing by Gradient Field Transformation using Cross-Projection Tensor (2006) IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2, pp. 2301-2308; Almaddah, A., Mae, Y., Ohara, K., Takubo, T., Arai: Visual and Physical Segmentation of Novel Objects (2011) IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Robots and System, pp. 807-812; Beevi, Y., Natarajan, S., An Efficient Video Segmentation Algorithm with Real Time Adaptive Threshold Technique (2009) International Journal of Signal Processing, Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, 61, pp. 304-311. , Springer, Heidelberg; Cretual, A., Chaumette, F., Bouthemy, P., Complex Object Tracking by Visual Servoing Based on 2D Image Motion (1998) Proceedings of the IAPR International Conference on Pattern Recognition, pp. 1251-1254. , Australia; Desouuza, G.N., Kak, A.C., Vision for Mobile Robot Navigation: A Survey (2002) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, pp. 237-267; Gonzales, R.C., Woods, W.E., (2001) Digital Image Processing, , Prentice Hall, New Jersey; Hai-Bo, L., Yo-Mei, W., Yu-Jie, D., Fast Recognition Based on Color Image Segmentation in Mobile Robot (2010) Proceedings of the Third International Symposium on Computer Science and Computational Technology, 2 (1), pp. 1-4; Kaushal, M., Singh, A., Singh, B., Adaptive Thresholding for Edge Detection in Gray Scale Image (2010) International Journal of Engineering Science and Technology, pp. 2077-2082; Li, P., Chaumette, F., Tahri, O., A Shape Tracking Algorithm for Visual Servoing (2004) IEEE Int.

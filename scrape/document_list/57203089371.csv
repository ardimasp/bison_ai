Human Resource Information Systems provide a lot of data on the employees, but there are still a few best practices on how to make use the abundant data for better decision making in Human Resources area. This limited implementation is mostly due to the decision making process in Human Resources is highly depended on the intuition, the use of advanced data analytics is still in the very early stage of implementation which is left behind in comparison to the use of advanced analytics in other areas such as Marketing, Sales or Finance. This article answers the question on how is the current implementation of predictive analytics in employee churn or employee turnover which is one of the most discussed topics in Human Resources Management, and which method of predictive analytics are better to use in predicting the employee churn. The answers of these questions are obtained from the result of a systematic literature review on the scholarly articles related to the topic published from 2000 to 2018 in major databases such as IEEE, ACM, Science Direct, Emerald and Willey Online. © 2019 Allied Business Academies.","Big data; Employees churn; Human resource analytics; Intelligent human resource systems; Predictive modeling",,,,,,"Ardehali, P.H., Paradi, J.C., Asmild, M., Assessing financial risk tolerance of portfolio investors using data envelopment analysis (2005) International Journal of Information Technology & Decision Making, 4 (3), pp. 491-519; Berengueres, J., Duran, G., Castro, D., Happiness, an inside job ?

Key performance indicator (KPI) in the maintenance processes are defined and applied as maintenance process' measurement. The purpose of this research is to define the critical KPI of maintenance process to improve the quality of service management. In this research, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is implemented from the previous studies (33 papers) related to the selection of KPI in the maintenance processes. This paper found that the most important KPI in maintenance is Availability that also becomes a leading indicator. Besides availability, there also some of KPI of maintenance such as Mean Time Between Stoppages (MTBS), Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), Maintainability, Safety, Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), Reliability, Performance Rate, Quality Rate, Maintenance Time, etc. The popular method to find KPI in maintenance is based on the theories from the existing literature, AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process), and interview the subject matter expertise in some companies. © 2019, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

The quantitative method was used in this study with UTAUT 2 model approach. Analysis was carried out on the results of the distributed questionnaire through Google Form to respondents in various big companies using SEM-PLS analysis technique. The outcomes demonstrated that the Habit factor bigly affected the acknowledgment and utilization of Cloud ERP, while Behavioral Intention had a big effect on long-term use by users in big companies in Indonesia. Apart from these factors, it was also found that many users knew and wanted to use Cloud ERP, but there were still a few big companies in Indonesia that adopted the system. Based on all of these, Cloud ERP vendors have a great opportunity to market their products to big companies in Indonesia due to the high level of user interest in the system. In addition, Cloud ERP vendors can pay attention to the Habit and Behavioral Intention factors as priorities in marketing their product. © 2019 IEEE.","big companies; cloud ERP; quantitative; UTA UT 2; vendor","Commerce; Adoption factors; Behavioral intention; Large companies; quantitative; Quantitative method; User interests; UTA UT 2; vendor; Information management",,,,,"Asri, M.N., Hashim, N.H., Ismail, D., Desa, W.N., Pearson product moment correlation (ppmc) and principal component analysis (PCA) for objective comparison and source determination of unbranded black ballpoint pen inks (2016) Forensic Sciences, pp. 1-18; Attuquayefio, S., Addo, H., Review of studies with utaut as conceptual framework (2014) European Scientific Journal, 10, pp. 249-258; Columbus, L., (2014) Why Cloud ERP Adoption Is Faster Than Gartner Predicts, , https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2014/02/07/why-clouderp-adoption-is-faster-than-gartner-predicts/#2dc6ef89dbb5, February 7; (2016) Unlocking the Benefits of Cloud-based ERP, , https://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2016/05/25/unlocking-the-benefits-ofcloud-based-erp/, May 25 Retrieved from The Wall Street Journal:; Elragal, A., Kommos, M.E., (2012) In-House Versus In-Cloud ERP Systems: A Comparative Study, , New Cairo: IBIMA; Endah, R.W., Uji Validitas dan Reliabilitas Dalam Penelitian Epidemiologi Kedokteran Gigi (2011) Stomatognatic, 8, pp. 27-34; Ettlie, J.E., Adequacy of stage models for decisions on adoption of innovation (1980) Psychological Reports, 46, pp. 991-995; Ghozali, I., (2011) Structural Equation Modelling: Metode Alternatif Dengan Partial Least Square PLS, , Semarang: Badan Penerbit Universitas Diponegoro; Gupta, A., Dogra, N., Tourist adoption of mapping apps: A utaut2 perspective of smart travellers (2017) Tourism and Hospitality Management, 23, pp. 145-161; Hair, J.F., Hult, G.T., Ringle, C.M., Sarstedt, M., (2014) A Primer on Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLSSEM), , California: SAGE; Heale, R., Twycross, A., Validity and reliability in quantitative research (2015) Evid Based Nurs, 18, pp. 66-67; Profil bisnis usaha mikro, kecil dan menengah (umkm) (2015) Jakarta: Kerjasama Lembaga Pengembangan Perbankan Indonesia Dan Bank Indonesia, , Lembaga Pengembangan Perbankan Indonesia, & Bank Indonesia; Peng, G.C., Gala, C., Cloud ERP: A new dilemma to modern organization?

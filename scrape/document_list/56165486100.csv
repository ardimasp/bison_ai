This study is aimed at exploring the collaboration in retracted publications and the influence on different kinds of scientific misbehaviors based on 4842 retracted publications in Web of Science Core Collection from 1978 to 2017. Search results showed that the proportion of international collaborations in retracted publications has fluctuated at around 20% in the past 17 years, and different collaboration patterns of major countries are revealed. The USA and China contributed to more than half of all retracted publications, while retraction rate of Chinese papers was three times higher compared to papers from the USA. A negative correlation between the proportion of internationally collaborative publications and the retraction rate was found. Countries involved in more international collaborations tend to have lower retraction rates. Also, the occurrences of plagiarism was found to be lower when a paper is contributed by more authors, while falsification or manipulation, errors or unreliable results appeared more frequently under the same condition. Conclusions are made with a focus on the need for more actions to strengthen the scientific norms and integrity within collaborative groups. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Bibliometrics; Coauthorship; Collaboration; Retracted publications; Scientific misconduct",,,,,"Zhejiang University, ZJU

This study aims at investigating the predictors of vulnerability to phishing and tailgating from the psychological perspective. The study was conducted on a sample of Indonesians (125 males, 137 females; Mage = 28 years old, SDage = 8.319 years); considered as the 'millennial' age group. Multiple linear regression analyses covering seven predictors of the vulnerabilities, i.e. insufficient knowledge/media literacy, excitement of victory, fear of authority, desire to be helpful, fear of loss, laziness, and appeal to ego, showed that the psychological models predicting vulnerability of experiencing phishing and tailgating were confirmed, with an effect size range between 18.5% to 19%. Media literacy alone was proven to be inadequate in managing/deterring the variables that embrace vulnerability to the two social engineering techniques. The relevance of this study to lifelong learning gravity is discussed throughout this article. © 2020 Birlesik Dunya Yenilik Arastirma ve Yayincilik Merkezi.

To give a theoretical basis for the efforts of preventing corruption that is thick with emotional nuance, this present study employs disruption to psychological contract, i.e. psychological contract breach (PCB), as a predictor of moral emotions proneness. The study involving 265 employees (169 males, 96 females; Mage = 32.32 years old; SDage = 7.28 years) of four big private banks in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, shows that PCB—with noting that, in this study, its scale operational scoring represents, reversely, the contract fulfillment—can predict Guilt-negative behavior evaluation (Guilt-NBE), Guilt-repair (Guilt-REP), and Shame-negative self-evaluation (Shame-NSE); all in negative directions, proved via simple linear regression analyses. Further analysis showed a more dynamic relationship between PCB and Guilt-NBE that fits to a cubic regression model. This study contributes to the axiological aspect of business psychology, especially in the ethical psychology of banking industry. © 2020 The Author(s)","Business psychology; Corruption; Guilt and shame; Moral emotion; Organizational psychology; Psychological contract; Psychology",,,,,"Binus University: 026/VR

This study tested the hypothetical framework that moral emotions proneness can indirectly predict corruption through mediation by ethical judgment. The research participants were 100 public officials who held leadership positions in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. We used a correlational-predictive design with path analysis. The results showed that most of the hypotheses were supported. This study contributes in providing extensions to the proposition that proneness to moral emotions (guilt-negative behavior evaluation and shame-negative self-evaluation) might detect corruption.

This present study aimed at finding theoretical models at the macro-and microlevels that are able to explain the penetration and acceptance. Study 1 examined hypotheses on the predictive relationship between national cultural orientation and Bitcoin penetration involving 60 countries. Study 2, using a construal level perspective, tested the predictive strength of psychological distances against Bitcoin acceptance, involving 565 Indonesians (Mage = 28.88 years, SDage = 12.482 years). The results showed that national culture of individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation are able to predict the penetration. Spatial/physical distance, social distance, and hypothetical distance are able to predict the acceptance. This research is pivotal in obtaining the fundamental factors of community vulnerability in accepting and endorsing new e-money, i.e. Bitcoin.

Existing views are diverse, influenced by geographical factors, cultural and ideological backgrounds, as well as biological theory. This present study initially suggested that the higher the relationship flourishing, the higher the tolerance for the infidelity. In an era where monogamous relationships are dynamized by the multiplication of relationship modes through online social networks, this study becomes increasingly urgent, i.e. to recommend a variable capable of providing a buffering effect to the deleterious effect of the infidelity. The study used correlational design. As much as 210 participants (55 males, 155 females, Mage=37.89 years old, SDage=10.870 years) were recruited in the Greater Area of Jakarta, Indonesia to fill out the Relationship Flourishing Scale and Internet Infidelity Tolerance-Emotional Infidelity Subscale. This study found that relationship flourishing and emotional Internet infidelity are negatively correlated (Spearman.s Rho=-0.172, p<0.05) and there is a moderating role of sex (coeff.=0.3481, p<0.05). That is, those with higher relationship flourishing would have a higher intolerance, especially among men. Such intolerance could lead to marital dissatisfaction and, at worst, divorce. The results of this study have implications for (1) an evaluation of psychometric dimensions of the Relationship Flourishing Scale, (2) the need of proposing moderating variables to be integrated into the correlational model between relationship flourishing and the infidelity, as well as (3) online applications development in detecting and managing the Internet infidelity. © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

If the notion is supported by data, then the moral damage in a society could be prevented by reducing the counterfeit self and behavior to a bare minimum. This study aimed at empirically testing the measurement model of counterfeit self of Wood et al. (2008) among Indonesians as well as theoretically reviewing counterfeit self roles in unethical behavior. The participants of this study were 1,655 high school students (764 males, 891 females; Mage = 15.76 years old; SDage = 1.08 years) recruited through a purposive sampling technique in North Sumatera and West Kalimantan, Indonesia. The data analysis technique used was Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The results showed that the counterfeit self model—comprised of counterfeit self dimensions, namely Self-alienation (ALIEN), Inauthentic Living (LIVE), and Accepting External Influence (EXT)—was supported by the empirical data. However, the dimension of EXT could not be represented by its indicators. The study contributed to the psychological body of knowledge that the EXT dimension might need to be excluded from the measurement of counterfeit self on teenagers, especially in Indonesia and other Eastern countries. © 2017 Kasetsart University","alienation; counterfeit; self; unethical",,,,,,,,,"Akin, A., Akin, U., Examining the relationship between authenticity and self-handicapping (2014) Psychological Reports: Mental & Physical Health, 115 (3), pp. 795-804; Bewersdorff, E., Virtuality and its discontents: An examination of self in cyberspace (2001), (Unpublished doctoral dissertation) Alliant University San Francisco Bay Campus, CA; Carver, C.S., Sinclair, S., Johnson, S.L., Authentic and hubristic pride: Differential relations to aspects of goal regulation, affect, and self-control (2010) Journal of Research in Personality, 44 (6), pp. 698-703; Chinelato, R.S.D.C., Ferreira, M.C., Valentini, F., Van den Bosch, R., Construct validity evidence for the individual authenticity measure at work in Brazilian samples (2015) Revista De Psicología Del Trabajo Y De Las Organizaciones, 31 (2), pp. 109-118; Chiou, W.-B., Wan, P.-H., Wan, C.-S., A new look at software piracy: Soft lifting primes an counterfeit sense of self, prompting further unethical behavior (2012) International Journal of Human-computer Studies, 70 (2), pp. 107-115; Christy, S.C., The experience of self-loving: A phenomenological investigation (1994), (Unpublished doctoral dissertation) The California Institute of Integral Studies San Francisco, CA; Cool, J., The mutual co-construction of online and onground in cyborganic: Making an ethnography of networked social media speak to challenges of the posthuman (2010) Working Paper Presented to The EASA Media Anthropology Network E-seminar, pp. 14-29. , http://www.media-anthropology.net/cool_cyberorganic.pdf, June 2010.

Three studies in an umbrella of social representation study were conducted involving 155 participants coming from Greater Jakarta and other Indonesia provinces (Study I, a preliminary study for extracting content frames on relationship; Mage = 21.6 years), 610 samples of images captioned with #RelationshipGoals in an online social media - Instagram - originated mostly from Western users (Study II, a content analysis), as well as 367 participants coming from Greater Jakarta (Study III, a survey for Relationship Goals Scale construction; Mage = 22 years). The results showed that there are three main dimensions of relationship goals, namely (1) Psychological Intimacy, (2) Sexual Activity, and (3) Religious Beliefs. It was found that religious belief should be the fourth pillar, not just the influencing factors of the Sternberg's triangular theory of love of romantic relationships. This study was successful in constructing relationship goals scale for the first time in Indonesia, to our best knowledge, which could be used for education and counselling. This present study also empirically indicated that the evolving analyses of Ulrich Beck, Stephanie Coontz, and Eli Finkel, that self-actualization has become the main romantic relationship goal, are perhaps exaggerated, especially in the context of social life of Indonesian. Individualized marriage might not be applicable as the representation of contemporary relationship zeitgeist in Indonesia. This study is pivotal in preventing marital divorce based on salient social meanings on the romantic relationship among young adults. © 2018 ACCENTS.","Psychoinformatics; Relationship goals; Relationship satisfaction;

Study 2 was a quasi-experimental study of 154 university students in Jakarta (68 men, 86 women; Mage=19.167 years, SDage=1.476 years) to test the hypotheses of the moderating effects of an outcome-based ethical mindset and entity self-theory on the effects of the counterfeit self on corruption behavior (dependent variable Study 2, operationally defined as performance in a bribery game) with a data analysis technique of the two-way ANOVA. The results of these studies (Study 1 and Study 2) generally confirm the hypotheses proposed.

This theoretical review aimed to propose a hypothetical psychological model capable of explaining the behavior of corruption. Moral disengagement is a variable that is considered ontologically closest in ""distance"" to the variable of corruption behavior. Counterfeit self, implicit self-theory, ethical mindset and moral emotion are taken into account as the pivotal factors of the corruption behavior and its mechanism of moral disengagement. Counterfeit self along with some moderating variables are regarded to ""set"" one's future corrupt behavior based on his/her past/prior ethical or unethical behavior and moral emotions. This review discovered a conjectural-theoretical model of the corruption psychology. It can be used to design a social intervention and training for individuals to manage the mindset and emotion that can buffer counterfeit self effect. In addition, the users of these research findings are recommended to be aware of the surroundings that consist of groups of people with particular ethical mindset, moral emotion proneness and self-theory. © 2018 Juneman Abraham et al.","Corruption; Counterfeit self; Ethical mindset; Moral disengagement; Moral emotion; Self-theory",,,,,,,,,"Abraham, J., Maulida, A.F., No harm no foul behavior and consumption motivation among Indonesian students (2015) Anima: Indonesian Psychol.

Regarding the context of humor in the political setting, humor can be used as a means of increasing morale and hope for individuals who feel discontent with the current political climate. Poking fun at politics has become even more widespread with the help of the Internet, which provides a medium in which different varieties of political humor are more easily accessible to the public. This study investigates the role of political humor appreciation types in predicting political dogmatism. The predictive-correlational design was conducted on 128 university students (67 males, 61 females; Mean of Age = 22.27 years old; Standard Deviation of Age = 3.33 years) in Greater Jakarta, Indonesia, recruited through convenience sampling technique. Multiple linear regression results showed that appreciation of the benign humor type has an inverse predictive relationship with political dogmatism. In contrast, appreciation of the subversive and undermining humor types can predict dogmatism in positive directions. Appreciation of the supportive humor type does not play a role in the dynamic of political dogmatism. The practical implication of this study is that the strategic use of each type of political humor needs to be carefully arranged so as not to be counterproductive. © Common Ground Research Networks, Kharisma Murti, Tommy Prayoga, Juneman Abraham, Tirta Nugraha Mursitama, All Rights Reserved.","Appreciation; Dogmatism; Political Humor",,,,,,,,,"Abraham, J., Pane, M.M., The mediating role of social competition identity management strategy in the predictive relationship between susceptibility to social influence, internet privacy concern, and online political efficacy (2014) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8407, pp. 492-499. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-55032-4_50; Abraham, J., Prayoga, T., Takwin, B., Political psychology of Indonesian political figure: A case study of a political entrepreneur who is not hesitant in paving a new way (2018) International Journal of Research Studies in Psychology, 7 (1), pp. 35-58. , https://doi.org/10.5861/ijrsp.2018.1863; Afrianty, D., (2016) Islam and Politics: Indonesia'S Identity Crisis, , http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/11/islam-politics-indonesia-identity-crisis-161121082414557.html, Aljazeera, November 22; Antawirya, A., (2013) Interview with The Corruptor, , https://ahmadantawirya.wordpress.com/2013/03/07/218/; Applegate, M., Cohen, J., Communicating graphically: Mimesis, visual language, and commodification as culture (2017) Cultural Politics, 13 (1), pp. 81-100. , https://doi.org/10.1215/17432197-3755204; Aritonang, M.S., Sapiie, M.A., Heriyanto, D., #Jenderalkardus vs. #Jenderalbaper: Twitterati mock prabowo, SBY in upset fallout (2018) The Jakarta Post, , http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/08/09/jenderalkardus-vs-jenderalbaper-twitterati-mock-prabowo-sby-in-upset-fallout.html, August 9; (2018) “'Apa Urusan Anda Menanyakan Itu' Dan Hal Lain Soal Wawancara Edy Rahmayadi” ['What Your Business Is About by Asking That' and Other Things About The Interview with Edy Rahmayadi], , https://www.bbc.com/indonesia/trensosial-45637696, BBC Indonesia; Bippus, A., Factors predicting the perceived effectiveness of politicians' use of humor during a debate (2007) Humor-International Journal of Humor Research, 20 (2), pp. 105-121. , https://doi.org/10.1515/HUMOR.2007.006; CAMEO Fun Campaign: Jokowi Presiden (2014) YouTube Video, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vi5l7h_YQx4; Fun Campaign: Prabowo Jokowi (2014) YouTube Video, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hITLHh0flPoandt=348s, -; Colom, G.G., Alcover, C.T., Sánchez-Curto, C., Zárate-Osuna, J., Study of the effect of positive humor as a variable that reduces stress: Relationship of humor with personality and performance variables (2011) Psychology in Spain, 15 (1), pp. 9-21; Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T., (2004) Introduction to Political Psychology, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Damanik, C., (2018) “Kronologi Kasus Meiliana Yang Dipenjara Karena Keluhkan Pengeras Suara Azan” [The Chronology of Case of Meiliana Who Was Imprisoned for Complaining Azan Loudspeakers], , https://regional.kompas.com/read/2018/08/23/15053451/kronologi-kasus-meiliana-yang-dipenjara-karena-keluhkan-pengeras-suara-azan, Kompas, August 23; Dewberry, D.R., Fox, R., Easy as 1, 2, 3: Rick Perry and self-deprecation as image restoration (2012) Journal of Contemporary Rhetoric, 2 (1), pp. 1-10; Ebbighausen, R., Indonesia is on the brink of disaster (2017) Deutsche Welle, , http://www.dw.com/en/indonesia-is-on-the-brink-of-disaster/a-37528124; Fadhil, H., PPP-NasDem-PSI nilai prabowo 'the winter soldier' cuma ikut-ikutan” [PPP-NasDem-PSI judged the prabowo's 'the winter soldier' to be just a conforming expression] (2018) DetikNews, , https://news.detik.com/berita/4261734/ppp-nasdem-psi-nilai-prabowo-the-winter-soldier-cuma-ikut-ikutan, October 18; Ferguson, M.A., Ford, T.E., Disparagement humor: A theoretical and empirical review of psychoanalytic, superiority, and social identity theories (2008) Humor: International Journal of Humor Research, 21 (3), pp. 283-312. , https://doi.org/10.1515/humor.2008.014; Ford, T.E., Ferguson, M.A., Social consequences of disparagement humor: A prejudiced norm theory (2004) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 8 (1), pp. 79-94. , https://doi.org/10.1207/S15327957PSPR0801_4; (2017) “Ternyata Raja Salman Dukung Ahok” [It Turned Out That King Salman Supported Ahok], , https://twitter.com/gerilyapolitik/status/836874963110014977, GerilyaPolitik. @GerilyaPolitik; Gibbons, S., How to include politics in your marketing without turning anyone off (2017) Entrepreneur, , https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/292018, March 28; Gross, R., (2010) Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behavior, , 6th ed.

Previous studies have identified variables that predict impulse buying, but not many of them have examined the human's self. This study aimed at investigating the roles of insecure self-engulfed self and perceived aesthetic of online shop in predicting the online impulse buying. The participants were 285 private sector employees (156 males and 129 females; Mean of the age of 27.1 years old; Standard deviation of the age of 5.9 years) in the Greater Jakarta, Indonesia. Data analysis using multiple linear regression analysis showed that empirical data supported the positive prediction hypotheses. An additional descriptive analysis applying the Terror Management Theory showed that participants with higher mortality salience tend to have more online buying experience, and they are inclined to purchase more luxurious items such as jewelry and expensive watch than participants with lower mortality salience. This study contributes to developing the interdisciplinary field of psychological science and information technology by integrating the self and the virtual medium of shopping variables as well as by recommending behavioral engineering to control online impulse buying. © International Journal on Advanced Science Engineering Information Technology.","Aesthetic; Business psychology; Impulsive buying; Mortality salience; Online; Self",,,,,,,,,"Lu, Z., Wang, S., Li, X., Yang, L., Yang, D., Wu, D., ""Online shop location optimization using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision model-Case study on Taobao.com,"" (2012) Knowl-Based Syst, 32, pp. 76-83; ""Meningkatnya pertumbuhan belanja online di pasar negara berkembang-portal lengkap dunia marketing,"" (2012) Portal Lengkap Dunia Marketing, , http://www.marketing.co.id/meningkatnya-pertumbuhan-belanjaonline-di-pasar-negara-berkembang/, [Accessed: 14-Dec-2016]; Marketing, D.I., (2016) ""E-commerce usage in Indonesia 2016,"", , http://www.dionlinesurvey.com/en/2016/09/23/e-commerce-usage-in-indonesia-2016/, DI Marketing Online.

This study aims to investigate the role of self-change awareness, response to change-events, and social comparison in predicting the dimensions of competitive anxiety in student-athletes actively engaging in sports games and academics. The dimensions of the anxiety are somatic anxiety, worry, and concentration disruption. The design of this study is predictive correlational. Multiple linear regression analysis was done to analyze the data. A total of 83 student-athletes (55 males, 28 females; mean of age = 20.45 years old, standard deviation of age = 1.50 years) who actively competed in sports, domiciled in Greater Area of Jakarta, Indonesia were recruited through purposive sampling technique. The result showed that the three predictors can predict two out of three dimensions of competitive anxiety. The results of this study have implications in the field of sport psychology to prevent competitive anxiety among student-athletes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Education computing; Linear regression; Sports; Change awareness; Indonesia; Jakarta; Multiple linear regression analysis; Perceptual factors; Sampling technique; Standard deviation; Three dimensions; Students",,,,,,,,"Gillham, E., Gillham, A.D., Identifying athletes' sources of competitive state anxiety (2014) J.

In particular, uncanniness emphasizes the sense of strangeness or weirdness that comes from something seemingly familiar within an unexpected context; e.g. talking animals contained in a story. People have different levels of sensitivity to the sense. Novels with the fantasy genre have been linked with uncanniness. The preference toward the uncanniness might be associated with magical thinking. Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human character in objects or animals, as a dimension of the thinking, is hypothesized to be able to predict sensitivity to uncanniness. The attitude toward thrownness could also allegedly predict the sensitivity. A positive attitude might function as an escape from, or the compensatory fulfilment of, existential emptiness. Participants of this study were 162 university students (67 males, 95 females, M age = 20.80 years old; SD age = 1.733 years) of the study program School of Design and Literature at Bina Nusantara University, Jakarta, Indonesia and the University of Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia, who were recruited through purposive sampling technique. The design of this study was correlational-predictive, and the data were obtained through the survey using psychological scales. Multiple linear regression analysis found that anthropomorphism has predictive power in the positive direction, while the attitude toward thrownness is not able to predict the sensitivity to uncanniness. This study has implication for art psychology and life science, about how to increase the enjoyment of readership regarding the factor raising appreciation toward a strange or fear perception experienced by a reader. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Animals; Education; Linear regression; Regression analysis; Sports; Art work; Indonesia; Life-sciences; Multiple linear regression analysis; Positive attitude; Predictive power; Sampling technique; University students; Forecasting",,,,,,,,"Vidler, A., (1996) The Architectural Uncanny: Essays in the Modern Unhomely, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Reuber, A.M., (2004) Haunted by the Uncanny-development of A Genre from the Late Eighteenth to the Late Nineteenth Century Unpublished Doctoral, , Dissertation (Baton Rouge, Lousiana, US: Louisiana State University); Freud, S., Haughton, H., McLintock, D., (2003) The Uncanny, , (UK: Penguin Classics); Miall, D.S., Kuiken, D., A feeling for fiction: Becoming what we behold (2002) Poetics, 30, pp. 221-241; (2016) What Is SENSITIVITY?, , http://psychologydictionary.org/sensitivity/, PsychologyDictionary.org; Feagin, S.L., (1996) Reading with Feeling: The Aesthetics of Appreciation, , (Ithaca, US: Cornell University Press); Borghart, P., Madelein, C., (2003) The Return of the Key: The Uncanny in the Fantastic Image & Narrative, 5. , http://www.imageandnarrative.be/inarchive/uncanny/borghartmadelein.htm; Cahill, M., (2012) The Role of Magic in Fantasy Literature: Exposing Reality though Fantasy, , Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation (Washington Ave., Albany, NY: University at Albany, State University of New York); Woolley, J.D., Thinking about fantasy: Are children fundamentally different thinkers and believers from adults?

For example, IoT in health domain comes a long way than just helping individuals regulate their body. It has enabled many social functions that connect users to serve more health related purposes. However, in Indonesia, as such an idea is still novel, there is a need to examine how is it being represented in health context to increase health capabilities. We asked 241 college students across Greater Jakarta (17-25 years old; Mean of age = 20.47 years old; Standard deviation of age = 1.469 years; 83 males, 158 females) 10 questions to measure their Social Representation towards IoT in the health domain. This is a descriptive research, and the instrument for data collecting is a questionnaire. The data obtained were analyzed using Voyant tool to generate words cirrus for every answer. The result showed that although participants generally perceive that IoT in health domain is potentially beneficial and can be used to increase health capabilities, there are a few practical agency freedom limitations, such as individual dispositions and economic status. © 2016 IEEE.","Health Capability; Internet of Things; Psychotechnology; Representation","Health; Information systems; Students; College students; Data collecting; Economic status; Psychotechnology; Representation; Social function; Social representations; Standard deviation; Internet of things",,,,,,,,"Prayoga, T., Abraham, J., Behavioral intention to use iot health device: The role of perceived usefulness, facilitated appropriation, big five personality traits, and cultural value orientations (2016) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE), 6 (4), pp. 1751-1765; Whitmore, A., Agarwal, A., Da Xu, L., The internet of things - A survey of topics and trends (2015) Inf.

The sample for this study was 255 psychology students across Greater Jakarta, Indonesia (52 males, 203 females; Mage = 20.309 years old, SDage = 1.182 years). Using path analysis, it was found that mathematics self-efficacy and appreciation towards history of mathematics can predict statistics appropriation, while ambiguity tolerance can predict previous bad mathematics experience. Finally, both statistics appropriation and previous bad mathematics experience can predict attitude towards statistics, thus confirming the hypothesized model.

This present study hypothesized that meaningful work and perceived unethicality of no harm no foul behavior (NHNF) can predict the proneness in positive directions. Simple linear regression analyses on data from 210 employees (122 males, 88 females; Mage=27.96 years old; SDage=5.265 years) in the Greater Area of Jakarta, Indonesia showed that meaningful work, but not NHNF unethicality perception, can predict most of moral emotions proneness. This study provides empirical evidence against speculative claims that meaning, both in the general and work life, contributes to human morality. Corruption can be minimized by improving work meaning. The underlying assumption is that both meaning and morality make up ""a good life"". This article uses an explanation of the work spirituality inspired by religious teachings - which indeed greatly influence the psychological reality of Eastern society, like Indonesian. This study provides optimism for the prevention of unethical behaviors since meaning is an entity that can be constructed and intervened.

Especially in the healthcare sector, IoT health devices have a great impact on individual's health-regulation. Through many beneficial features from tracking sleep patterns to calories intake measure, individuals will gain a better understanding of their body to keep them healthy. However, benefits do not immediately equal users' acceptance. In this study, we seek to find variables that we propose could predict user's intention to use IoT health device and integrate them into a theoretical model. We analyzed user's technology acceptance from the perspective of Technology Acceptance Model, using Perceived Usefulness as the main predictor for Behavioral Intention. We also integrate Personality Traits and Facilitated Appropriation as factors to determine Perceived Usefulness, and finally using Cultural Value Orientations at the individual level, we seek to determine the antecedents of Facilitated Appropriation. The research design was predictive correlational with path analysis statistical technique. Participants of this study were 186 college students (75 males, 111 females; mean = 20.86 years old, standard deviation = 2.01 years) across Greater Jakarta. The results showed that Perceived Usefulness can predict Behavioral Intention to use the device. However, Personality Traits are found to be irrelevant in predicting Perceived Usefulness. Only Facilitated Appropriation predicts Perceived Usefulness. Among cultural values proposed, only the Long-term Orientation predicts user's tendency to engage in Facilitated Appropriation. Also, we did not find any correlation between age and Behavioral Intention, Perceived Usefulness, and Facilitated Appropriation. Copyright © 2016 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

This study aimed to map the development of Intercultural Sensitivity (ICS) among students of Bina Nusantara University and other private universities in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia (n = 317), using Bennett's DMIS theoretical framework (2004). The data was analyzed by using Z-score descriptive statistics, t-tests, and one-way ANOVA. The research results showed that the majority of Bina Nusantara University's students are in the Acceptance stage, in which one is already able to value, respect, and appreciate different values, beliefs, and behaviors from other cultures. Meanwhile, the majority of other private, religious-based universities' students are in the Defense stage, in which one still has a persistent belief that Indonesia's culture (""Indonesia"" as defined by their lens) is the most valid among the world's cultures. © Common Ground Publishing, Anastasia Teoriman, Juneman Abraham Johannes A.

Dissatisfaction and unsustainability of marriage have led the urgency of premarital education in various countries. The problem is that the spread of virtual reality has made marriage itself to become more complex and experience reinterpretation and reconfiguration, moreover with the emergence of new kind of marriage in the digital era, i.e. virtual marriage. Everybody who has observed, known, or even tried, certainly asks the question, ""Could (or: should) I accept virtual marriage?"" . This study was aimed to investigate the role of tolerance of ambiguity and illusion of intimacy in online dating in predicting the acceptance of virtual marriage. There were 420 adolescents and young adults (212 males, 208 females; Mage=21.10 years old, SDage=1.459 years; 338 students, 82 employees or entrepreneurs) in the Greater Jakarta, Indonesia, participated in this study. It was found that the acceptance was not predicted by the ambiguity tolerance, but by the illusion of intimacy in online dating. The psychometric issues, substantive discussion, and recommendation are presented at the end of this article. The trend of virtual marriage should not be allowed to roll away, by autopilot, without loaded by strategies in designing an online game as one of the pivotal educational technologies that needs to shape appropriate character and attitude for it.","Ambiguity; Intimacy illusion; Marriage psychology; Online marriage; Psychotechnology",,,,,,,,,"Abraham, J., Sharron, S., Attitude toward game, emotional awareness, and thinking style among high school students (2015) Advanced Science Letters, 21 (6), pp. 1845-1849. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/asl.2015.6134; Abraham, J., Utami, D.P., Faza, I.R., The role of perceived uncertainty, ego identity, and perceived behavioral control in predicting patient's attitude toward medical surgery (2014) Makara Journal of Health Research, 18 (3), pp. 103-112. , http://dx.doi.org/10.7454/msk.v18i3.4021; Bailey, O., Chin, Y.-L., Cultural characteristics, social and political significance of online relationships in China (2010) Proceedings from the Asian Media & Mass Communication Conference 2010, Osaka, Japan, pp. 15-27. , http://research.sabanciuniv.edu/15068/1/MediAsia_2010_Official_Conference_Proceedings.pdf; Baj-Lindsey, C., (1998) The Tolerance of Ambiguity: An Investigation Across Attitudinal, Behavioral/motivational, and Perceptual Dimensions in Pacifist and Fundamentalist Samples (Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation), , http://www.worldcat.org/title/tolerance-of-ambiguity-an-investigation-across-attitudinal-behavioral-motivational-and-perceptual-dimensions-in-pacifist-and-fundamentalist-samples/oclc/39200601, Miami Institute of Psychology, The Caribbean Center for Advanced Studies, Miami, Florida, USA; Banyumurti, I., (2016) Internet Indonesia Dalam Angka: Kumpulan Data Statistik Tentang Internet Indonesia, , http://www.slideshare.net/banyumurti/internet-indonesia-dalam-angka-2015-2016, SlideShare; Blackhart, G.C., Fitzpatrick, J., Williamson, J., Dispositional factors predicting use of online dating sites and behaviors related to online dating (2014) Computers in Human Behavior, 33, pp. 113-118. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2014.01.022; Bors, D., Gruman, J., Shukla, S., Measuring tolerance of ambiguity: Item polarity, dimensionality, and criterion validity (2010) Revue Européenne de Psychologie Appliquée/European Review of Applied Psychology, 60 (4), pp. 239-245. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erap.2010.07.001; Bridges, J.C., (2012) The Illusion of Intimacy: Problems in the World of Online Dating, , https://books.google.co.id/books/about/The_Illusion_of_Intimacy.html?id=SIqTGKbgoOwC&redir_esc=y, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, LLC; (2005) Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary, , (2nd ed.)., Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press; Chareonwongsak, K., Globalization and technology: How will they change society?

Therefore, it is important to identify the variables undermining the efficiency and effectiveness. This study aimed to investigate the role of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived playfulness of online collaboration tool (as elements of technology acceptance) and xenophobia in predicting social loafing (at the individual level)-a social psychological phenomenon that shows the declining performance of the individual when working in the group. The contribution of this research is its attempt to combine social psychological and technological factors in explaining human performance in the context of the group when interacting with technology. The research design was correlational predictive, with multiple linear regression data analysis technique. Participants of this study were 80 students and employees (43 males, 37 females; mean of age = 25.58 years of old, standard deviation of age = 4.92 years) who work using online collaboration tool in a virtual team. The results showed that the perceived playfulness, perceived ease of use, and xenophobia were able to predict an individual's social loafing, but the perceived usefulness is not able to predict it. Implications of the results of research in order to prevent social loafing are stated in the Results and Analysis section. © 2015 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

There are three social intervention solutions conducted during October 2014 to January 2015 in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, as part of Social Psychology and Psychological Intervention Course Program that will be discussed in detail, namely 1) intervention toward the observer’s (bystander’s) attitude toward the violence to be a preventer of the violence (or, to be an upstander), 2) intervention eliminating women objectification among men, and 3) intervention reducing verbal violent behavior against women. All those three will be discussed in an intervention methods of PATH, a model constructed by Abraham P. Buunk and Mark Van Vugt (2013) consisting of four stages, i.e. Problem formulation (Problem), Analysis and explanation (Analyze), Test stages (Test) and Intervention implementation (Help). The intervention targets are the students, the late teens, and the young adults through 1) Handbook of Violence Prevention to offer support and assistance for the actual and potential victims of domestic violence, 2) the campaign via radio mass media for prevention of women objectification, as well as 3) the delivery of contemplative messages through shirt and pin for verbal abuse prevention. © 2015, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

It is pivotal to optimize the potential and real benefits of video games, either in the field of education, sports, entertainment, or health. It needs involving psychological approaches to do so. This predictive-correlational research posits that emotional awareness and thinking style are affective and cognitive aspects that need to be considered in designing video games that can bring a positive attitude. A study on 153 high school students (Mage =16.41 years old; SDage =0.983 years) in Bekasi, Indonesia, with multiple regression data analysis, showed that there are unique contributions of the two predictors to the attitude whose effects are moderated by types of game players (expert vs. novice). © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

This study contributes by identifying predictor variables of prisoner's learned helplessness. The design of this research is quantitative-predictive correlational design. This research hypothesized that social rejection and three types of neurotic personality orientations (moving away from people, moving against people, and moving toward people) are able to predict learned helplessness of prisoners. As it is known in the literature of Knowledge Management, learned helplessness lessens one's effort to understand complex issues. In addition, prospective approach to knowledge management suggests that learned helplessness should be transformed into learned optimism. The participants of this research were 163 inmates from Cipinang IA Penitentiary Institution and Pondok Bambu IIA Prison in DKI Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia. The measurement tools of this study were adapted and developed from Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire, Karen Horney's Three Orientations, and Learned Helplessness Scales. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that social rejection and the tendency of ""moving toward"" are not able to predict learned helplessness. The tendency of ""moving away"" and of ""moving against"" are able to predict learned helplessness in the negative ways. All results of this research will be discussed by employing relevant psychological theories and knowledge management perspective. The implication of result of this research toward efforts in facilitating learning as well as knowledge creation and management of prisoners in prison is proposed in the Discussion section of this article. The authors are of the position that if all these things are well facilitated, the prisoners will be a valuable social capital for Indonesia.","Knowledge management; Learned helplessness; Psychology","Forecasting; Linear regression; Prisons; Regression analysis; Knowledge creations; Learned helplessness; Measurement tools; Multiple linear regression analysis; Predictor variables; Psychological theory; Psychology; Social capitals; Knowledge management",,,,,,,,"Coolidge, F.L., Segal, D.L., Benight, C.C., Danielian, J., The Predictive Power of Horney's Psychoanalytic Approach: An Empirical Study (2004) The American Journal of Psychoanalysis, 64 (4), pp. 363-374; Downey, G., Feldman, S.I., Implications of Rejection Sensitivity for Intimate Relationships (1996) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70 (6), pp. 1327-1343. , http://socialrelations.psych.columbia.edu/measures/rs-personal/24-rejection-sensitivity-questionnaire-rsq, online; El-Den, J., Applying Positive Psychology to Knowledge Management (2012), Paper presented at The European Conference on Knowledge Management (ECKM), Cartagena, Spain, September 5-6; Kejahatan Korupsi Berjalan Cepat Dibanding Hukum (2011), http://www.ti.or.id/index.ph/news/2011/10/14/kejahatan-korupsi-berjalan-cepat-dibanding-hukum, online; Fasabeni, M., Pembebasan Bersyarat Corby Ditentang (2014), http://www.gresnews.com/berita/hukum/18062-pembebasan-bersyarat-corby-ditentang/, online; Fiske, S.T., Harris, L.T., Cuddy, A.J.C., Why Ordinary People Torture Enemy Prisoners (2004) Science, 306 (5701), pp. 1482-1483; Greco, M., Stenner, P., Happiness and the Art of Life: Diagnosing the Psychopolitics of Wellbeing (2013) Health, Culture and Society, 5 (1), pp. 1-18; Haslam, S.A., Reicher, S.D., When Prisoners Take Over the Prison: A Social Psychology of Resistance (2012) Personality and Social Psychology, 16 (2), pp. 154-179; Psychoanalytic Social Theory-Karen Horney (2010), http://www.ivcc.edu/uploadedFiles/_faculty/_mangold/Horney%20and%20Psychoanalytic%20Social%20Theory.pdf, online; Kim, S.H., Vincent, L.C., Goncalo, J.A., Outside Advantage: Can Social Rejection Fuel Creative Thought?

During the interview process, the authors provided intervention to participants in the form of fear communication and minimal counseling with the purpose to divert their intention of giving to beggars into giving of the donation through authorized disseminator of social assistance. This research found that factors such as religion, compassion, institutional corruption, and law enforcement play important roles in determining preferred target of prosocial behavior. Nevertheless, the cognitive-emotional intervention conducted by the authors was successful, which was indicated by the fact of 12 of the 20 participants agreeing to divert their target of prosocial behavior. © 2014, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

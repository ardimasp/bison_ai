The purpose of offloading is to save energy on the mobile devices. When offloading is being carried out, data size is the determining factor of the energy consumption both in mobile device and bandwidth consumption. To minimize the data size factor, data size can be minimized by using compression techniques before it is being offloaded. But when the data is being compressed, mobile devices also consumes energy. The energy consumption required for compression depends on the data size and the quality of the data compression. The system requires a decision-making model to determine whether compression is needed or not. The proposed method for this tradeoff is using machine learning regression methods to make decision based on predictions of the smallest energy consumption value. The test uses 1,210 data which is trained by 5-fold cross validation to find the smallest RMSE value. Regression method with the smallest RMSE value is applied to test data as an evaluation. The results showed that energy consumption efficiency had an average value of 38.68% compared to sending compressed image data without decision-making model. The efficiency value of energy consumption with decision-making model versus direct offloading has an average value of 8.34%. © 2019 IJSTR.","Cross validation; Decision-making; Energy efficiency; Machine learning; Prediction; Regression method; RMSE",,,,,,"Wu, H., Multi-Objective Decision-Making for Mobile Cloud Offloading: A Survey (2018) IEEE Access, pp. 3962-3976; Cuervo, E., B.A., MAUI: Making smartphones last longer with code offload (2010) ACM, pp. 49-62; Debashis, D., Mobile Cloud Computing: Architectures, Algorithms and Applications (2015) Chapman and Hall/CRC Press, 4; Qi, H., Gani, A., Research On Mobile Cloud Computing: Review, Trend and Perspectives (2012) 2nd International Conference on Digital Information and Communication Technology and its Applications, , DICTAP 2012; Kaur, A., Kaur, K., A Comparative Study of Code Offloading Techniques and Application Partitioning Methods in Mobile Cloud Computing (2016) International Journal of Computer Applications; Lin, Time-and-Energy-Aware Computation Offloading in Handheld Devices to Coprocessors and Clouds (2013) IEEE Systems Journal, pp. 1-13; Sadler, C.M., Martonosi, M., Data Compression Algorithms for Energy-Constrained Devices in Delay Tolerant Networks (2006) Proceeding of ACM SenSys; Wibowo, P.S., (2017) Rancang Bangun Mobile Computation Offloading Framework untuk Peningkatan Kinerja dan Penghematan Daya pada Smartphone (Studi Kasus Leaf Recognition), , Institut Teknologi Sepuluh November, Surabaya; Rustamaji, H.C., Mariani, Yuwono, B., (2014) Aplikasi Kompresi Data Menggunakan Metode Huffman Statik pada Perangkat Mobile Berbasis Android, pp. 9-18. , Telematika; Singh, M., Kumar, S., Chouhan, S., Shrivastava, M., Various Image Compression Techniques: Lossy and Lossless (2016) International Journal of Computer Applications; Tawalbeh, Studying the Energy Consumption in Mobile Devices (2016) The 13th International Conference on Mobile Systems and Pervasive Computing; Balakrishnan, An Energy Efficient Code Offloading Approach for Mobile Cloud Computing (2016) Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 9 (48), pp. 1-5; Li, Make Smartphones Last A Day: Pre-processing Based Computer Vision Application Offloading (2015) 12th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON), , Seattle, WA, USA; Soni, M., Shukla, N., Data Compression Techniques in Cloud Computing (2016) IJARCCE Journal, , ISSN: 2319-5940; Senthilkumar, M., Mathivanan, V., Analysis of Data Compression Techniques using Huffman Coding and Arithmetic Coding (2016) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science and Software Engineering; Govinda, K., Kumar, Y., Storage Optimization in Cloud Environment using Compression Algorithm (2012) International Journal of Emerging Trends & Technology in Computer Science, , ISSN: 2278-6856; Kasireddy, S., Bojja, V., (2012) Measurements of Energy Consumption in Mobile Applications with respect to Quality of Experience, , Blekinge Tekniska Hogskola, Karlskrona; Kasireddy, S., (2012) Measurements of Energy Consumption in Mobile Applications with Respect to Quality of Experience, , Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden; Segata, Towards energy efficient smart phone applications: Energy models for offloading tasks into the cloud (2014) IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), , Sydney, NSW, Australia; Chandrasekhar, V., Chen, T., Chen, C.H., Takacs, G., Vedantham, R.R., Grzesczcuk, R., Bach, G., The Stanford Mobile Visual Search Dataset (2011) Proceedings of the First ACM Multimedia Systems Conference (MMSys), , San Jose; Liu, DeepN-JPEG: A Deep Neural Network Favorable JPEG-based Image Compression Framework (2018) 55th Annual Design Automation Conference",,,,"International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research",,,,,22778616,,,,"English","Int.

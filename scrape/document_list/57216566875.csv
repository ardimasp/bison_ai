Voting is also often used in determining something that are very important, such as determining people's representative council. In addition, the current voting is still using the Conventional system that uses paper in balloting, and vote counting. This can cause human error. The technology that is increasingly developing in the current era of globalization is e-voting. From this research, an e-vote system will be developed that applies the concept of the block chain node with smart contract. Smart contracts generate unique code for each new election. So that manipulation of election results will not be possible because each voter has only one account and one address block chain. From the results of the test the author can conclude that the smart contract block chain can be used to prove the results of a safe choice and create e-voting that is honest. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The point is, a set of interfaces (can be in the form of functions, methods or endpoint URLs) that we can use to develop applications, both on one platform and across platforms. The purpose of the API is to speed up the creation of an application because programmers do not need to write code from scratch. The API is also provided by a platform to be able to access the features of that platform. In addition, if the API is available then only need to design the interface performance concept. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Study case in Indonesia, has 238 million population as the fourth largest developing country in the world with total internet users around 28.07 million people transacted to meet their needs through e-commerce. As a result of a pandemic, various e-Commerce services have implemented several strategies to compete and survive in pandemic situation considering that several countries in Southeast Asia are experiencing decreasing economic growth. one of the strategies by implemented the gamification concept which is expected to change human behavior by increasing motivation, engagement and loyalty. Therefore, this study aims to determine what dimensions affect the use of the e-Commerce application from the results of measuring the success of its implementation especially the gamification concept. The proposed model in this research combines Information System Success Model with adding advertising and trust construct. It tested by structural equation model-partial least square using SmartPLS software. It conducts using online questionnaire with a total of 469 Shopee user respondent who have transacted or non-transactions by distributing google form questionnaires online through social media in the Indonesia capital city. The model is compatible for predicting the intention to use the e-Commerce system in Indonesia. The result shows the dimension for intention to use e-Commerce system are system quality, advertising quality, and service quality. The findings also indicate intention to use which will affect use dimension are influenced by system quality and service quality in this study have a major impact that can affect the use of the e-Commerce system so that it can compete with other e Commerce by paying attention to it. This study provides theoretical findings to encourage business strategies in the field of e-Commerce, especially during a pandemic and enhance the measuring information system success using modified Information System Success Model that has never been done by other researchers. © 2020, Success Culture Press.

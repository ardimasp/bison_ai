The transformation of the mobile banking application into a digital banking application conducted by banks has made users re-evaluate based on their preferences. This study presents the behavior of users of digital banking applications in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The hypothesis model is based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with additional factors of the social image, perceived risk and perceived trust adopted from Muñoz-Leiva et al. (2017). The methodology in this study includes data collection through questionnaires distributed online and data analysis using the Structural Equation Model. The results of this study illustrate that the perceived trust and perceived risk have a more dominant part in influencing user attitude and user intention to use digital banking. Meanwhile, social image, perceived ease-of-use and perceived usefulness are not significant in influencing user attitude and user intention to use digital banking. The implication of this research helps to determine the right communication and strategy so that more users with more benefits can utilize this digital banking application. © 2020.

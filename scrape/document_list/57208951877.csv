The reporting system commonly used utilizes query which consumes a large amount of time in order to generate results fulfilling requirements set by the user. In order to simplify and speed up reporting in digital world and eventually results in improvement of business, the business entity needs a system which can address problems quickly and easily. In this paper, data warehouse system which could simplify and speed up the reporting provisions that is needed by the business without having to modify the existing query being implemented. With Kimball approaches, the data to be reported could be customized in various forms in accordance with the requirements set by the entity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Rizzi, S., From star schemas to big data: 20+ years of data warehouse research (2018) J.

The purpose of this research is to develop a classification system for jamu efficacy based on the composition of plants using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and to implement the k-means clustering algorithm as a feature selection method. The result of this study was compared to the previous research that using SVM method without feature selection. This study used variances to evaluate the results of clustering. The total of 3138 data herbs and 465 plant species were grouped into 100 clusters with the variance of 0.0094. The managed group succesfully reduced the data dimension into 3047 of jamu sample and 236 species of herbs and plants as features. The result of SVM classification using feature selection yielded the accuracy of 71.5%. © 2015 IEEE.","classification; feature selection; jamu; k-means; machine learning; Support vector machine","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Clustering algorithms; Feature extraction; Information systems; Learning systems; Plants (botany); Support vector machines; Classification system; Feature selection methods; jamu; K-means; k-Means algorithm; K-Means clustering algorithm; Natural materials; SVM classification; Classification (of information)",,,,,"Mahady, G.B., Global harmonization of herbal health claim (2001) J.Of Nutr, 131, pp. 1120S-1123S; Mendi, F.M., Darusman, L.K., Morita, A.H., Altaf-Ul-Amin, M., Takahashi, H., Nakamura, K., Tanaka, K., Kanaya, S., Efficacy prediction of jamu formulations by pls modeling (2012) Curr Com Put Aided Drug des, , Oct23.

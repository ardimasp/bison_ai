The solar cathodic protection is single of the demands of solar energy which is very important to protect oil and gas pipelines from corrosion and also to connect the remote stations to main control room through SCADA and donates to dipping greenhouse gas (GHG) discharges and redeemable energy. The purpose of this study to conduct an assessment of technical-economic feasibility of solar cathodic protection in Qatar, and the opportunity of dipping GHG emissions. Solar cathodic shield connections examination was done by RETScreen software. The result shows the opportunity of substantial energy reserves with solar energy connection in CP. Station Mile 38 (Total yearly provided energy (MWh) = 8) and a significant decrease in GHG (Total yearly net decrease of GHG = 7.7 tCO2, which matches to 17.8 barrels of not expended crude oil). © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In the United States, the disease is the leading cause of death for people of most ethnicities. In Indonesia, the disease contributes 17% of the total mortality. It is also well-known that a regular or continuous monitoring the heart rate is necessary to minimize the fatality. At the current technological state, the monitoring method is expensive and often requires a wearable sensor, which is inconvenient. This study intends to establish a relationship between the heart rate and speech signals empirically by using regression and correlation analysis. The speech signals are analyzed through a frequency analysis using fast Fourier transform. The results suggest that vowel ‘e’ speech signal has a strong correlation to the heart rate. © 2019, ICIC International.

It already proved its success not only in reducing human error in reading the mammograms but also shows better and reliable classification into benign and malignant abnormalities.This paper will report and attempt on using Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) for mammograms classification based on Gray-level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture based features.In this study, normal and abnormal breast image used as the standard input are taken from Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) digital mammogram database. The computational experiments show that RBFNN is better than Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN) in performing breast cancer classification. For normal and abnormal classification, the result shows that RBFNN's accuracy is93.98%, which is 14% higher than BPNN, while the accuracy of benign and malignant classification is 94.29% which is 2% higher than BPNN. © 2015 The Authors.

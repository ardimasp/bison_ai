In this paper, we analyzed the accuracy of BLE for measuring distance in order to build the indoor positioning application. The problem of BLE in distance measurement and indoor position are low accuracy that is caused by the fading effect. We discussed about the effect of changing the value of advertising interval to the accuracy of distance measurement by application, between BLE as a Transmitter and a Smartphone with Android OS as a receiver. The result showed that the accuracy of distance measurement will increase if the value of advertising interval is decreased. © 2016 IEEE.","accuracy; advertising interval; Bluetooth Low Energy; Receiver; Transmitter","Distance measurement; Marketing; Receivers (containers); Transmitters; accuracy; Android ossa; Bluetooth low energies (BLE); Bluetooth low energies (BTLE); Fading effect; Indoor positioning; Measuring distances; Wireless devices; Bluetooth",,,,,"Ekwe, O., Abioye, A., Effective fading reduction techniques in wireless communication system (2014) Electronics and Communication Engineering; Faragher, R., Harle, R., An Analysis of the Accuracy of Bluetooth Low Energy for Indoor Positioning Applications; Gomez, C., Oller, J., Paradells, J., (2012) Overview and Evaluation of Bluetooth Low Energy: An Emerging Low-Power Wireless Technology, , sensors; Ryan, M., Bluetooth: With Low Energy Comes Low Security; Borowicz, W., (2015) How Do Beacons Work.

In this part, the phenomena evolved in many countries. In line with this, early research reported the impact of learning using social media by researchers, both positive and negative impact on the university student. However, the researchers encountered demanding effort to obtain the research report on the causal impact of university student background, such as academic achievement, terms, and student social media behavioural activities. This ceaseless research attempts to explore the gap attributed. Therefore, this quantitative and causal or explanatory research will convey the social media impact of behavioural use for the learning of university student. The research involved 336 university students as the respondent in this research. Technically, SPPS application is used to process the data with Correlation Bivariate technique. The research found 29 correlations regarding the university student background and the activities of using media social for learning and a debatable result emerged from early research eventually. © 2020 IEEE.","Explanatory research; Quantitative method; Social media; Social media for learning; SPSS bivariate","Information management; Social networking (online); Academic achievements; Bivariate; Learning media; Research reports; Social media; University students; Students",,,,,"Syed Ahmed, M., Kabir, S.M.A., The acceptance of smartphone as a mobile learning tool: Students of business studies in Bangladesh (2018) Malaysian Online J.

The goal is to parse the intent of complex text lessons into more effective and understandable forms. The use of thinking map is specifically the tree map, bubble map, flow map and brace map which is then also applied the design principle, which uses character illustration and place focused on simple outline, hierarchy of information by using typography and line and shape as navigation map thinking in one edugraphic. The results show a communication creation that the content is more simple than long text because the intent of the content of knowledge has been conveyed through the thinking map and design principles. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Design Principles; Effective media; Elementary schools; Navigation map; Tree-maps; Physics",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

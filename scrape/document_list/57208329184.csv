The primary objective of the study is to examine students’ intentions to become entrepreneurs as an impact of gamification model learning in Entrepreneurship or Business Plan courses in BINUS ONLINE Learning. Data collection was carried out for 400 students who took Entrepreneurship and Business Plan courses for 1 month using questionnaires. The data was then analyzed using multiple linear regression approach. The result shows that attitude towards behavior (ATB), perceived behavior control (PBS), and subjective norms partially give positive impacts and they are significant to entrepreneurial intentions. Perceived behavioral control (PBC) is the dominant factor in forming entrepreneurial intentions for students. © 2020 by the authors","Entrepreneurial Intentions; Long Distance Learning Program; Planned Behavior",,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; (2019) Pertumbuhan Ekonomi Indonesia Triwulan IV-2018.

Online learning is one of the innovations for this recent changing paradigm. In this study, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is applied to examine the determinants of students' perceived learning outcomes and satisfaction in the context of university online course. Independent variables include instructor facilitation, technical support, course structure, instructor feedback, self-motivation, peer support, and interaction as potential determinants of online learning. A total of 400 BINUS Online Learning students were surveyed. The structural model result reveals that instructor facilitation, technical support, instructor feedback, and self-motivation affect the learning outcomes, and instructor facilitation, technical support, self-motivation, and peer support significantly affect the students' satisfaction. © 2019 IEEE.","Learning outcomes; Online learning; Students' perception; Students' satisfaction","Education computing; Learning systems; Motivation; Students; Independent variables; Information technology and communications; Method of learning; Perceived learning outcomes; Structural equation modelling (SEM); Structural modeling; Students' satisfaction; Technical support; E-learning",,,,"Binus University","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was funded by Bina Nusantara University Research Grant Year 2018.","Bolliger, D., Key factors for determining student satisfaction in online courses (2004) Int.

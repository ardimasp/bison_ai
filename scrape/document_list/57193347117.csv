As a country that has the second largest forest area in the world, Indonesia got less successful in forest industry plants based Transmigration. This becomes an interesting phenomenon. From the point of previous literature review can be seen that variety aspects related to the impact of the strength of strategic planning and corporate performance such as in studies on the assessment outline controversy and inconsistency in general. Some research groups on strategic planning effectiveness showed positive performance, and another research showed negative performance. However, there has no research related to the strategic planning effectiveness impacts to the performance of the forest industry plants until now.

The article addressed the use of Zachman Framework to address challenges, and for successful implementation of Big Data Optimization. The article takes the case study in Astra International subsidiary such as Auto2000, an automotive dealer company that faced some challenges in inflexibility and complexity with handling stock and demand forecasting. The article applies the advantages of big data and combined with Zachman approach to address the transformation from business perspective into IT operation. The article addresses the role of brand principal to cut inefficient cost. The objective of this article to examine the use of Zachman approach with assistance of big data, and its analytic tools in the area of machine learning to investigate the user requirements how to predict the efficient the 3-month stock demand and allow stock planning optimisation at Country and Branch level through business flow understanding. © 2019 IEEE.","Big Data; Stock Demand Forecasting; Zachman","Big data; Metadata; Business decisions; Business perspective; Data optimization; Demand forecasting; Forecasting system; Stock redistribution; Zachman; Zachman framework; Forecasting",,,,,"Alicke, K., (2016) Big Data and the Supply Chain: The Big-Supply-Chain Analytics Landscape (Part 1), , https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/big-data-And-the-supply-chain-the-big-supply-chain-Analytics-landscape-part-1, 6 May 2019; Alicke, K., (2016) Supply Chain 4.0-the Next-Generation Digital Supply Chain, , https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/supply-chain-40-the-next-generation-digital-supply-chain, 6 May 2019; Kolassa, S., Siemsen, E., (2016) Demand Forecasting for Managers, p. 05; Benkamoun, N., ElMaraghy, W., Huyet, A.-L., Kouiss, K., Architecture framework for manufacturing system design (2014) Procedia Cirp, 17, pp. 88-93; Pereira, C.M., Sousa, P., A method to define an enterprise architecture using the zachman framework (2004) Proceedings of the 2004 Acm Symposium on Applied Computing-sac '04; Bondar, S., Hsu, J.C., Pfouga, A., Stjepandic, J., Agile digital transformation of system-of-systems architecture models using zachman framework (2017) Journal of Industrial Information Integration, 7, pp. 33-43; Nogueira, J.M., Romero, D., Espadas, J., Molina, A., Leveraging the zachman framework implementation using action-research methodology-A case study: Aligning the enterprise architecture and the business goals (2013) Enterprise Information Systems, 7 (1), pp. 100-132; Harkai, A., Cinpoeru, M., Buchmann, R.A., The what"" facet of the zachman framework-A linked data-driven interpretation (2018) Advanced Information Systems Engineering Workshops, pp. 197-208; Owen, G.T., Qualitative methods in higher education policy analysis: Using interviews and document analysis (2014) The Qualitative Report, 19 (26); Chen, M., Mao, S., Liu, Y., Big data: A survey (2014) Mobile Networks and Applications, 19 (2), pp. 171-209; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., (2012) Critical Questions for Big Data: Provocations for a Cultural, Technological, and Scholarly; Abdullah, A., Zainab, A.N., Are Malaysian students ready to be authors of digital contents?

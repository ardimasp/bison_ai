Most of the food waste comes from expired or unused goods that are not being consumed by the household. According to this condition, the purpose of this study to analyze and design a solution with a food management inventory using a mobile systems platform, that we called Fridger Inventory Management (FIM), which can control every item which is stored inside the fridge. The methodology of this study consists of an analysis process and system design. In the analysis process, focus on analyzing the business environment and collect the requirement with a survey, interview, and reference. In the design process, this study tries to build a model using UML (Unified Modelling Language) diagram, database, and user interface design. The output of the study will provide a solution with the applicable features to minimize the number of food waste. The system features will provide an expiry date reminder, fridge sharing feature that allows the inventory control by more than one user, then the system also provides the cooking recommendation based on what the user has in their fridge. With the implementation of these systems, Fridge users are assisted to manage stock of food effectively and it can reduce food waste with an effective and efficient fridge management system. © 2020 IEEE.","Food waste; Fridge; Inventory management; Mobile application","Food waste; Information management; Inventory control; Modeling languages; Refrigerators; User interfaces; Analysis process; Business environments; Food management; Inventory management; Management systems; Sharing features; UML (unified modelling language); User interface designs; Waste management",,,,,"Tonini, D., Albizzati, P.F., Astrup, T.F., Environmental impacts of food waste: Learnings and challenges from a case study on UK (2018) Waste Manag., 76, pp. 744-766; Chung, S.S., Lo, C.W.H., Local waste management constraints and waste administrators in China (2008) Waste Manag., 28 (2), pp. 272-281; Mostafa, G.M.A., Shazly, M.M., Sherief, W.I., Development of a waste management protocol based on assessment of knowledge and practice of healthcare personnel in surgical departments (2009) Waste Manag., 29 (1), pp. 430-439; Bhuiyan, S.H., A crisis in governance: Urban solid waste management in Bangladesh (2010) Habitat Int., 34 (1), pp. 125-133; Dou, Z., Ferguson, J.D., Galligan, D.T., Kelly, A.M., Finn, S.M., Giegengack, R., Assessing u. s. food wastage and opportunities for reduction (2016) Glob.

There are many new mobile applications with high user feedback but few download rates. Moreover, some users of the application are unwilling to give their feedbacks. This abrupt state is caused by the carelessness of mobile application developers in noticing the importance of user feedback and user behavior. In this paper, we will state several steps and options that could be taken by mobile application developers to popularize their mobile application. This solution is mainly focused on the utilization of user feedback and user behavior, which also include proper use of feedback loop, great advertising, and behavioral change. The objectives of this analysis are to change unpopular mobile applications with high user feedback to become popular mobile application with high user download rate, as well as to encourage users to properly express their opinion regarding the application by giving out their feedback to the mobile application developers. © 2017 IEEE.","Behavioral Change; Download Rate; Feedback Loop; Mobile Application; User Behavior; User Feedbacks","Artificial intelligence; Feedback; Internet of things; Mobile computing; Behavioral changes; Feed-back loop; Mobile applications; User behaviors; User feedback; Behavioral research",,,,,"Islam, R., Islam, R., Mazumder, T.A., Mobile application and its global impact (2010) International Journal of Engineering & Technology, 10 (6), pp. 72-78; (2015) Mobile Medical Application: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, , U.S. Department of Health Human Services Food and drug Administration, Rockville, MD, USA, February; Holzer, A., Ondrus, J., Mobile application market: A developer's perspective (2011) Telematics and Informatics, 28 (1), pp. 22-31; Adrian, D., Tarigan, R.E., The effect of revenue and market segmentation level towards venture capital investment in mobile application business (2014) International Journal of Communication & Information Technology (CommIT), 8 (1), pp. 10-16. , May; Cheng, J., Mizli, C.D.N., Leskovec, J., How community feedback shapes user behaviour (2014) Proceedings of the 8th International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, , 1-4 June; Hattie, J., Timperley, H., The power of feedback (2007) Review of Educational Research, 77 (1), pp. 81-112. , March; Renaud, K., Cooper, R., Feedback in human computer interaction-characteristic and reccomendation (2000) South African Journal, 2000 (26), pp. 105-114. , Nov; Brookhart, S.M., (2008) How to Give Effective Feedback to Your Student. 2nd Ed, , Virginia, USA, Association for Supervision and CurriculumDevelopment (ASCD); Storey, J., (2015) Cultural Theory and Popular Culture, 7th Ed, , New York, USA, Routledge; Astrom, K.J., Murray, R.M., (2008) Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers, , New Jersey, USA.

Competitive advantage has become a major concern for companies in today's global market, especially the chemical industry. Based on an analysis of past research, there has been no research investigating information technology, strategic leadership, and overall knowledge management of competitive advantage in the context of chemical companies in Indonesia. Furthermore, the novelty of this research is to examine the relationship between information technology, leadership, and knowledge management on the competitive advantage in a research model. This study uses a quantitative method with a research population of chemical companies in Indonesia, total 1519 companies and a sample of 114 companies. The sampling technique uses an intentional sampling method, and the data analysis uses multiple regression analysis with SPPS 25. The results of this study indicate that information technology, strategic leadership, and knowledge management have a significant positive relationship with a competitive advantage. The implications of this study indicate that a manager's leadership strategy ability and the application of knowledge management for employees in this industry significantly influence competitive advantage. The use of information technology for strategic purposes should be more widely applied to increase competitive advantage. © 2020 IEEE.","Competitive Advantage; Information technology; Knowledge Management; Strategic Leadership","Chemical analysis; Chemical industry; Competition; Human resource management; International trade; Chemical companies; Competitive advantage; Multiple regression analysis; Quantitative method; Research models; Sampling method; Sampling technique; Strategic leadership; Knowledge management",,,,,,"Pratama, W.P., (2019) Chemical Industry Ready to Compete in Industry Development 4. 0, , https://ekonomi.bisnis.com/read/20190129/257/883700/ChemicalIndustryReadytoCompeteinIndustryDevelopment4.0, Bisnis. com; Siwi, C.C., Massie, J.D., Tumewu, F., An analysis of bankruptcy prediction in manufacturing firm by using bankruptcy models (case study in chemical sub sector listed in Indonesia stock exchange 2013-2017) (2018) J.

Therefore, the higher education institutions demand the lecturers also supporting staff to acquire aligned behaviors in organizational citizenship and knowledge management. This research aims to measure organization citizenship behavior (OCB) and knowledge management behavior (KMB) of supporting staff in a higher education institution. The research was conducted at the Bina Nusantara University, especially supporting staff at Kemanggisan Campus Jakarta. Organizational citizenship behavior as the independent variable is reflected perfectly into five dimensions - altruism, civic virtue, consciousness, courtesy, and sportsmanship. Knowledge management behavior as the dependent variable is reflected perfectly into three dimensions: knowledge creation, knowledge sharing, and knowledge update. The measurement and structural model developed by using SmartPLS explain that OCB has a positive and significant impact on KMB. The results of statistical tests show that female supporting staffs more than five years of service has a higher score in OCB and KMB significantly. © 2020 IEEE.","Demographic characteristics; Human capital; ICT; Knowledge management behavior; Organizational citizenship behavior; Organizational learning; Social web","Behavioral research; Human resource management; Dependent variables; Higher education institutions; Independent variables; Knowledge creations; Knowledge-sharing; Organizational citizenship behaviors; Quality of education; Structural modeling; Knowledge management",,,,,,"Nonaka, I., Toyama, R., The theory of the knowledge-creating firm: Subjectivity, objectivity and synthesis (2005) Ind.

This phenomenon can definitely trigger the digital players in Indonesia to choose online business as their career option. Therefore, there is a need to inculcate the entrepreneurial spirit of students, especially information systems and computer science students. This research work aims at analysing the Entrepreneurial Orientation by exploring its components in line with students majoring in information systems and computer science in Indonesia. It also examines the correlation between Entrepreneurial Orientation and students' preference towards entrepreneurship. Questionnaires have been distributed to the information systems and computer science students at 5 different universities in Indonesia. The hypotheses were developed after conducting the pilot testing. By using the cluster probabilistic random sampling, the 1.230 questionnaires have been distributed and this data collection process yielded back with 381 usable responses that were examined by utilizing SPSS and structural equation modelling. This study finally reveals that there are three dimensions under the Entrepreneurial Orientation variable that are risk-taking, innovativeness and proactiveness. Further, this study reveals that the EO dimensions are positively correlated with entrepreneurial intention among information systems and computer science students. This research is one of the first studies that try to exert and analyse the Entrepreneurial Orientation among information system and computer science students in Indonesia using AMOS-SEM software. Suggestion for future research are also proposed. © 2019 IEEE.","computer science students; entrepreneurial intention; entrepreneurial orientation; information systems students; structural equation modelling; technopreneur","Information management; Information systems; Information use; Risk management; Students; Surveys; Computer science students; entrepreneurial intention; Entrepreneurial orientation; Structural equation modelling; technopreneur; Distributed computer systems",,,,,,"Tahun 2017 jumlah pengguna internet di Indonesia capai 143. 26 juta (2018) Suara Sektor ICT Indonesia, , https://mastel.id/tahun-2017-jumlah-pengguna-internet-di-Indonesiacapai-143-26-juta/, APJII.

The financial companies are no exception, especially with the increasing trend of competition today. Therefore, this research paper focuses on evaluating existing resources within the company as well as any company activities that significantly affect the company's revenue targets through secondary data analysis. Resource-Based Theory (RBT) and Dynamic Capability Theory (DCT) are the central theories that have been used in this paper. The results of this study concluded that human resources through recruitment contributed the most significant support to the company's performance, especially on non-bank financial institutions listed on the stock exchange.

Large businesses are expected to encourage the growth of micro, small and medium business. However, it turned out that the crisis had stopped the success of Indonesia's economic development, which resulted in many large businesses experiencing bankruptcy and largescale termination of employment. In contrast to large businesses, micro and small businesses recover faster from the crisis, and workers who are affected are absorbed into these micro and small businesses. Speed of recovery of micro and small businesses due to the more flexible nature of the business, relatively small capital, and generally does not depend on imported raw materials and foreign debt. Also, many micro and small businesses have sprung up and have begun to have an important role in Indonesia's national economy. In 2017, micro and small businesses made a stagnant ante to Indonesia GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of 60.34%. Therefore, it is important to maintain the stability of the performance or even improve it. The purpose of this study was to analyse the effect of market orientation, marketing capabilities, and product innovation on the performance of micro and small businesses, especially in West Jakarta. The number of samples is determined using the Slovin formula, which is 270 samples of 835 population, micro and small business people in West Jakarta City who already had a Micro Small Business License. While data collected using a questionnaire it was analysed using SPSS software. The results indicate that the most influential on the business performance is product innovation and followed by marketing capability, then the last is market orientation. © 2019, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Business performance; Market orientation; Marketing capability; Micro and small business; Product innovation",,,,,,"Authors would like to thank respondent who wholeheartedly willing to fill out the questionnaire despite their busy days, support from the SMEs West Jakarta and to our university.","Abbas, D., Pengaruh Modal Usaha, Orientasi Pasar dan Orientasi Kewirausahaan terhadap Kinerja UKM Kota Makassar (2018) Jurnal Manajemen, Ide, Inspirasi (MINDS), 5 (1), pp. 95-111. , (Januari-Juni) 2018; Ali, H., (2013) Marketing dan Kasus-Kasus Pilihan, , Yogyakarta: Center for Academic Publising Servive; Andalan, dan Hikmah, T.R., Faktor-Faktor yang Mempengaruhi Kinerja UMKM Di Kabupaten dan Kota Semarang (2013) E-Jurnal Manajemen Untag, 2 (1), pp. 102-114; Assauri, S., (2007) Manajemen Pemasaran, , Dasar, Konsep dan Strategi.

One of them is a service industry that relies on knowledge-based activities to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. Knowledge workers are employees who increase the value of enterprises by producing, creating, developing, and applying knowledge at work, regardless of their educational background. During their tenure, they are able to solve problems creatively. Knowledge management behaviours are about organizational routine activities. Specifically, a knowledge management behaviour is an individual activity of collecting, managing, applying, sharing and updating knowledge, as a dynamic humanist process. The dimensions of knowledge management behaviours are creating, disseminating, collaborating, learning, applying, strengthening and recycling knowledge. The purpose of this research is to find out the differences among Indonesian knowledge workers in service industries in Jakarta based on demographic factors. A survey of 137 respondents was conducted using a questionnaire as the data collection method. The results show that there is a difference in the knowledge management of Indonesian knowledge workers based on gender. However, there were no differences in knowledge management of Indonesian knowledge workers based on education, tenure and age. © Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Demographic factors; Human resources management; Knowledge management behaviour; Knowledge worker",,,,,,,"Al-Zu'bi, H.A., Organizational Citizenship Behavior and Impacts on Knowledge Sharing: An Empirical Study (2011) International Business Research, 4 (3), pp. 221-227. , https://doi.org/10.5539/ibr.v4n3p221; Aliakbar, E., Yusoff, R.B., Hasnaa, N., Mahmood, N., (2014) Determinants of Knowledge Sharing Behavior Determinants of Knowledge Sharing Behavior, pp. 208-215. , 29(February 2012); Bakhari Ismail, M., Mohammad Yusof, Z., Demographic Factors and Knowledge Sharing Quality among Malaysian Government Officers Communications of the IB IMA Demographic Factors and Knowledge Sharing Quality among Malaysian Government Officers (2009) Communications of the IBIMA, 9, pp. 1-8; Boateng, H., Dzandu, D.M., Agyemang, F.G., The effects of demographic variables on knowledge sharing Article information (2015) Library Review, 64 (3), pp. 216-228; Celep, C., Çetin, B., Teachers' perception about the behaviours of school leaders with regard to knowledge management (2005) International Journal of Educational Management, 19 (2), pp. 102-117. , https://doi.org/10.1108/09513540510582408; Chen, C.J., Huang, J.W., How organizational climate and structure affect knowledge management-The social interaction perspective (2007) International Journal of Information Management, 27 (2), pp. 104-118. , https://doi.Org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2006.ll.001; Chou, S.Y., Ramser, C., A multilevel model of organizational learning: Incorporating employee spontaneous workplace behaviors, leadership capital and knowledge management (2018) Learning Organization, , https://doi.org/10.1108/TLO-10-2018-0168; Chun-Hsien, L., Fang-Pei, N., Chin-Yung, P., Tao-Sheng, C., A Study on the Correlations between Knowledge Sharing Behavior and Organizational Citizenship Behavior in Catering Industry: The Viewpoint of Theory of Planned Behavior (2014) Anthropologist, 17 (3), pp. 873-881; Darroch, J., Developing a measure of knowledge management behaviors and practices (2003) Journal of Knowledge Management, 7 (5), pp. 41-54. , https://doi.org/10.1108/13673270310505377; Dhabi, A., (2018) Role of organisational culture, leadership and organisational citizenship behaviour on knowledge management Amna Ali AlMansouri *.

One of reasons is their weak sensing capability. This research intends to examine the effect of sensing capability (SC) on how logistics service firms-financial performance (LSF-FP) pass through innovative logistics services (ILS). This research used a quantitative method. Data was collected using questionnaires and probability sampling. The sample size consisted of 150 respondents from logistics service firms (LSF) registered as members of Association (ILFA) in the Jakarta (Jabodetabek) region. Unit of observation was constituted by leaders (managers or directors) of the firms. The collected data was analysed by using the SEM-PLS program. This research found that SC had importance role on ILS and financial performance of LSF-FP in Indonesia. In term of implementation, SC must be able to ILS in order to have a more significant impact on their financial performance of LSF-FP. © Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Financial performance; Innovative logistics services; Logistics service firm; Sensing capability",,,,,,,"Aguinis, H., (2014) Performance Management, , Third Edition.

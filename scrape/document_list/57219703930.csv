There are many health application available on mobile phones. However, the applications available on the market right now are usually only able to do a specific task, such as calorie tracker or fitness tracker or blood pressure tracker. To maintain or improve health and fitness we need to take into account combination of several factors, which require users to use different applications. In this paper, we developed a mobile application that has combined health-relevant features: a calorie tracker to help user loss or maintain weight, blood pressure and pulse tracker, and fitness tracker. These are three essential factors to help user live a healthy life and prevent heart disease. In addition, we also implemented a simple gamification feature to increase users' motivation to use the application and do the exercises. The experimentation and findings showed that the proposed solution would be beneficial to help people keep a healthy heart and go fit. © 2019 IEEE.","Blood Pulse; Calorie Tracker; Gamification; Health Status; Mobile Application; Recommender","Blood; Blood pressure; Cardiology; Gamification; Mobile computing; Heart disease; Infectious disease; Mobile applications; Relevant features; Specific tasks; Diseases",,,,,"Rachmi, C.N., Li, M., Baur, L.A., Overweight and obesity in Indonesia: Prevalence and risk factors-a literature review (2017) Public Health, 147, pp. 20-29; Dewanti, W., High prevalence of child obesity in Jakarta sparks concerns The Jakarta Post, , http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/10/16/high-prevalence-childobesity-jakarta-sparks-concerns.html, 16 October 2014, [Accessed 29 Febuary 2016]; Hruby, A., Hu, F.B., (2015) The Epidemiology of Obesity: A Big Picture.

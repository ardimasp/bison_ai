Data are obtained from interviews, questionnaires, and analysis of company documents. The method used in this research is descriptive by using the ISSP framework from Ward and Peppard, and the results of strategic recommendations are documented by using the Enterprise Architecture framework from Scott A. Bernard. The result of this research is a blueprint related to IS business strategy, IS/IT management strategy, and IT strategy that may help PT XYZ achieve the strategic goals. From those results, it can be concluded that there are some proposed applications, security tools, knowledge and skill profile, and recommendations of IS/IT infrastructure that can be applied at the company. © 2017 IEEE.","Application portfolio; Information system strategic planning; IS business strategy; IS/IT management strategy; IT strategy; Ward and peppard framework","Information systems; Information use; Planning; Strategic planning; Surveys; Business strategy; Enterprise Architecture; External environments; Future applications; Information systems/information technologies; IT strategies; Management strategies; Ward and peppard framework; Information management",,,,,"Dmitrij, L., Vida, D., Influence of information systems on business performance (2013) Vilniaus Gedimino Technikos Universitetas, 5 (1), pp. 38-39; Pabedinskaite, A., Factors of successful implementation of erp systems (2010) Ekonomika Ir Vadyba, 15, pp. 691-692; Kamal Mohammed, A., Ahmad Subaimi, B., The impact of interaction quality factors on the effectiveness of web-based information system: The Mediating Role of User Satisfaction (2013) Cogn Tech Work, 16, p. 451; Al-Aboud Fahad, N., Strategic information systems planning: A brief review (2011) IJCSNS International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, 11 (5), pp. 179-183; Raja, A., Barbara, C., Suhizaz, S., Strategic is planning practices: A comparative study of Malaysia and New Zealand (2014) International Conference on Accounting Studies, 164, pp. 516-521; John, W., Joe, P., (2002) Strategic Planning for Information System; 3rd Edition, , John Willey & Sons, Buffins Lane, Chicester; Bernard Scott, A., (2012) An Introduction to Enterprise Architecture; 3rd Edition, , AuthorHouse, Bloomington",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1st International Conference on Applied Computer and Communication Technologies, ComCom 2017","17 May 2017 through 18 May 2017",,133505,,9781509040483,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

This approach would as well give valuable information of which shelfs are the most dynamic hence indicating traffic. In supermarket, products are taken from shelves by costumers are not detected before they go to the cashier. If that happened, they will have problem to detect how many product taken from shelves to help them maintaining product if all the product are sold. There is some method to help them maintaining product and one of them is using computer vision. Background subtraction can help to see the product that are taken from shelves in supermarket. It’s not just it can detect product that are taken from shelves but also it can also count it. It can count how many product that are taken from shelves. This research will be focusing on object counter and object subtraction. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

In current modern society, information technology exists as a multidisciplinary tool to solve lingering problems that could not be solved by traditional efforts. This paper aims to provide knowledge regarding identified efforts to fight corruption specifically in Indonesia region. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology is used as the methodology, and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow is used as framework to identify relevant records. Scopus database is used as data source. A total of 10 records are labelled as relevant to this research, and the findings are synthesized. It was found from the records that the main areas of interest for ICT research for corruption prevention in Indonesia are (1) information transparency, (2) operational enhancement, (3) success evaluation, (4) security and fraud, and (4) decision support. The findings are expected to assist future research in term of providing valuable insights on corruption prevention using ICT in Indonesia. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

To imagine the severances of it, 10.000 KM of highway can be built with that much amount of fund. Several responses has been done by Indonesian government to fight corruption from both prevention and persecution. This work focuses on the development of a web application aimed to provide insight to corruption case per province in Indonesia. The web application was developed using Machine Learning, specifically Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Web crawling and web scraping techniques are used to gather news content from 7 major news portal in Indonesia. Accuracy is measured by comparing correct prediction by ANN to its true value. Upon finding corruption news, data is saved and further analysis is done to establish the number of corruption news per region. Finally, the output is visualized using Google Map API. The purpose of this work is to provide regional depiction of corruption case to give further insight to be used by decision makers. Upon using this web application, objectivity of program development is expected to increase. The final output of the web application is a map of corruption case in Indonesia per region.

In this research, sales promotion is the monetary promotion. By using a good sales promotion, the company will know the customer perception of the brand. Previous studies have stated that monetary promotion is a key element in a successful marketing strategy. The management of hypermarkets needs to understand the dynamic of monetary promotion and conceive new ways of organising and executing hypermarket activities that add values to customers. A total of 100 shoppers at a selected hypermarket was used as samples. This study adopted a customer-based approach to address consumer aspects affecting brand awareness, perceived quality, brand association, and brand loyalty. The unit of analysis were Indonesian consumers who are familiar with Antis brand and actively shop at Carrefour’s Puri Hypermarket Jakarta, Indonesia. Data was analysed using Structural Equation Modelling-Partial Least Square (PLS-SEM) method. The results showed intensity of distribution channels had a positive significant influence on perceived quality, brand awareness, brand association, and brand loyalty.

The purposes of this research is: (1) to test the new construct of CRM based on elements of social media related to the customer relationship, (2) to investigate the relationship between CRM and purchase intention, (3) to investigate the relationship between purchase intention and customer loyalty, (4) to examine the effect of purchase intention as a mediating role between CRM and customer loyalty, (5) to examine psychological distance as the moderating role between CRM and purchase intention. The conceptual focus of CRM model is to see the effectiveness of using social media to create purchase intention and their impact on customer loyalty. This research used SEM analysis with Smart PLS 2.0 version to test the validity and reliability of the data. The data sample is collected from Twitter and Facebook users. The results indicated that the CRM has a positive influence on purchase intention. On the other hand, purchase intention has a positive effect on customer loyalty and at the same time, it played a mediating role between CRM and customer loyalty. Psychological distance was moderated by CRM and purchase intention. The four hypotheses are supported. The limitation of this research is that it is only confined to Twitter and Facebook users that usually go to hypermarkets in five biggest malls in Jakarta. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

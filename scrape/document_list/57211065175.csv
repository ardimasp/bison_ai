To enhance the model performance, the efforts implemented include optimizing the training process by applying sliding-windows methods and setting appropriate parameters. After obtaining the best settings, the proposed model was then compared with two other variants of the LSTM model, namely Vanilla LSTM and Stack LSTM. The model performance evaluation was done by finding Mean Square Error (MSE) and root mean square error values from training and testing process. The results show that there were increased performances from using sliding-windows method to optimize the training process and the appropriate parameter setting. Bidirectional LSTM model, along with the treatments implemented, gave the best performance compared to the two other models.

There are many new mobile applications with high user feedback but few download rates. Moreover, some users of the application are unwilling to give their feedbacks. This abrupt state is caused by the carelessness of mobile application developers in noticing the importance of user feedback and user behavior. In this paper, we will state several steps and options that could be taken by mobile application developers to popularize their mobile application. This solution is mainly focused on the utilization of user feedback and user behavior, which also include proper use of feedback loop, great advertising, and behavioral change. The objectives of this analysis are to change unpopular mobile applications with high user feedback to become popular mobile application with high user download rate, as well as to encourage users to properly express their opinion regarding the application by giving out their feedback to the mobile application developers. © 2017 IEEE.","Behavioral Change; Download Rate; Feedback Loop; Mobile Application; User Behavior; User Feedbacks","Artificial intelligence; Feedback; Internet of things; Mobile computing; Behavioral changes; Feed-back loop; Mobile applications; User behaviors; User feedback; Behavioral research",,,,,,"Islam, R., Islam, R., Mazumder, T.A., Mobile application and its global impact (2010) International Journal of Engineering & Technology, 10 (6), pp. 72-78; (2015) Mobile Medical Application: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, , U.S. Department of Health Human Services Food and drug Administration, Rockville, MD, USA, February; Holzer, A., Ondrus, J., Mobile application market: A developer's perspective (2011) Telematics and Informatics, 28 (1), pp. 22-31; Adrian, D., Tarigan, R.E., The effect of revenue and market segmentation level towards venture capital investment in mobile application business (2014) International Journal of Communication & Information Technology (CommIT), 8 (1), pp. 10-16. , May; Cheng, J., Mizli, C.D.N., Leskovec, J., How community feedback shapes user behaviour (2014) Proceedings of the 8th International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, , 1-4 June; Hattie, J., Timperley, H., The power of feedback (2007) Review of Educational Research, 77 (1), pp. 81-112. , March; Renaud, K., Cooper, R., Feedback in human computer interaction-characteristic and reccomendation (2000) South African Journal, 2000 (26), pp. 105-114. , Nov; Brookhart, S.M., (2008) How to Give Effective Feedback to Your Student. 2nd Ed, , Virginia, USA, Association for Supervision and CurriculumDevelopment (ASCD); Storey, J., (2015) Cultural Theory and Popular Culture, 7th Ed, , New York, USA, Routledge; Astrom, K.J., Murray, R.M., (2008) Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers, , New Jersey, USA.

This application will map the poverty levels of the water from 8,576 villages, 573 subdistricts and 35 regencies in Central Java by using the technique of spatial data mining and the approach of the water poverty index (WPI). Seeing the magnitude of that application scope, then it needs to do the software complexity measurement to find out further the resources needed for the development of the system in the future. The measurement of the software complexity is held with the Function Point (FP) method that produces the estimation of the resource requirements such as project work effort, project duration and speed of delivery. The results of the research showed that the software water poverty mapping owns the complexity level with FP at 136.64, the project work effort at 1,273 hours, the project duration in 4.037 months and the speed of delivery at 33.85 FP per person month. © 2017 IEEE.","Function point analysis; Software complexity measurement.; Water poverty mapping","Computer software; Data mining; Decision making; Java programming language; Mapping; Complexity levels; Function point analysis; Mapping applications; Poverty mappings; Resource requirements; Software complexity; Spatial data mining; Water poverty indices; Application programs",,,,,,"Saptono, P., (2013) Kualitas Air Baku di Jawa Tengah Merosot Suara Karya Newspaper, 18 January; (2006) Palgrave Macmillan.

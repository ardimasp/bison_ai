Data collected through surveys and multiple linear regression used to test hypotheses. One hundred two respondents participated in the online survey, and the data is valid and reliable. The results of the study prove that the six risk factors perceived by consumers in shopping online have a negative and significant impact on consumer purchase intentions. Among the factors studied, time/psychological risk factors are the main contributors to consumers in considering making an online purchase. © 2020 IEEE.","E-commerce; Online consumer behavior; Online purchase intention; Online purchasing","Electronic commerce; Information management; Linear regression; Sales; Surveys; Consumer purchase; Multiple linear regressions; Online surveys; Online transaction; Perceived risk; Purchase intention; Risk factors; Purchasing",,,,,"Doolin, B., Dillon, S., Thompson, F., Corner, J.L., Perceived risk, the internet shopping experience and online purchasing behavior: A New Zealand perspective (2005) J.

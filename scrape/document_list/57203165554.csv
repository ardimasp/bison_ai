EA in STT-PLN began to be published since 2013. The software size of the EA STT-PLN will be measured with use case point method. Measurement of the software size of EA STT-PLN will be measured with Use Case Point upon use case diagram for EA STT-PLN as shown in the project has small software size where score Use Case Point (UCP) = 70.34. UCP is another alternative implementation method which can be applied to measure application software size whenever needed to deal with time, money and people. © 2017 IEEE.","Software Measurement; Software Metrics; Software Project; Use Case Point","Artificial intelligence; Personnel; Software Measurement; Software metrics; Software project; Software size; System information; Use case diagram; Use case points; Application programs",,,,,"Anda, B., Benestad, H.C., Hove, S.E., A Multiple-Case Study of Software Effort Estimation based on Use Case Points (2005) Int.

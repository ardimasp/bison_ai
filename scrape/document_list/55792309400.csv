The presence of someone in an organization is a sign that the person is carrying out their obligations to come to the agency or organization. Usually, attendance is done manually. It can be signed or called one by one. In this digital age, there must be a change from this absence to be able to accelerate and provide time efficiency. We can use face recognition to record attendance from everyone present in an organization. In this face recognition, many algorithms are performed to dissect and capture images of someone’s face, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning. With this algorithm, the system can recognize a person’s face and record attendance from that person so that attendance activities are more efficient and faster. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Attendance management; Attendance system; Face capturing; Face recognition; Machine Learning","Computational methods; Deep learning; Intelligent systems; Software engineering; Attendance systems; Capture images; Digital age; Time efficiencies; Face recognition",,,,,,"Agrawal, S., Khatri, P., Facial expression detection techniques: Based on Viola and Jones algorithm and principal component analysis (2015) 2015 Fifth International Conference on Advanced Computing & Communication Technologies, Pp. 108–112.

The application is intended to help people with visual limitations or blind people to access Android-based devices so that they can use library resources by using android devices. Design/methodology/approach: The necessary data are collected from journals, articles, books and questionnaires, and similar applications are analyzed. The application design method used is the Scrum method, which consists of Backlog, Sprint and Scrum Meeting. From the operational side of the application, the method used is speech-to-text and text-to-speech. Findings: This application has been tried with some users who have total blindness and low vision, and all provided a good response to this application. From the performance side, the user gives a very satisfied response to this application. While the ease of using the application, the user also provides a satisfactory response to the ease of using this application. Research limitations/implications: The application still has limitations in penetration to the user, and the application is only built using Android as its platform. In addition, the dependence on libraries from Google has caused difficulties in implementing this application with local dialect, which is only understood by the local community. Social implication: This application has implications for the society, especially those with limitations in eyesight can be so much more productive and independent. This can reduce the social burden in society. Originality/value: This application provides an easy access of an android device to blind people and people with low vision, as well as access to library resources with devices that have been installed with this application. This facility can improve the library accessibility to the blind and visually challenged community. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Android; Application; Assistant; Blind; Mobile device; Speech; Text; Voice recognition",,,,,,,"Bruegge, B., Dutoit, A.H., (2004) Object-Oriented Software Engineering Using UML, Patterns and Java-(Required) (Vol. 2004), , Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ; Craven, J., (2003) Access to electronic resources by visually impaired people; Epp, M.A., Closing the 95 percent gap: library resource sharing for people with print disabilities (2006) Library Trends, 54 (3), pp. 411-429; Lee, W.M., (2012) Beginning Android 4 Application Development, , John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ; Naone, E., TR10: intelligent software assistant - MIT technology review (2017) MIT Technology Review, , www2.technologyreview.com/news/412191/tr10-intelligent-software-assistant/, (accessed: 27 November 2017; Sutherland, J., Schwaber, K., (2011) The definitive guide to scrum: the rules of the game",,,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,07419058,,,,"English","Libr.

The prediction information about PGA is important to minimize the effect of earthquake. The method for prediction is Ordinary Kriging. It is geostatistic method used to predict data in certain locations which have autocorrelation. The sample data used in this research are PGA in Meuraxa, Banda Aceh 2006. The steps of research methodology consist of autocorrelations identify by Moran’s I and LISA, build semivariograms, and prediction by Ordinary Kriging. The results is Ordinary Kriging can be applied to predict PGA. It was shown by evaluate of mean and MSE value. According to mean value of three prediction, all models (Gaussian, Spherical, and Exponential) have mean 0,3534; 0,3584; and 0,3555 which approaches the actual PGA mean 0.34. According to MSE value, it can be seen that all models have small MSE or relatively closed to zero. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",,"Autocorrelation; Computational methods; Earthquakes; Geophysics; Interpolation; Earthquake acceleration; Geostatistic; Ordinary kriging; Peak ground acceleration; Prediction informations; Research methodologies; Semivariograms; Spatial autocorrelations; Forecasting",,,,,,"http://www.bmkg.go.id/RBMKG Wilayah 10/Geofisika/gempabumi.bmkg, Accessed: 12 Dec 2012; Irwansyah, E., Winarko, E., Rasjid, Z., Bekti, R., Earthquake hazard zonation using peak ground acceleration (Pga) approach (2013) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 423. , IOP Publishing, 012067; Megawati, K., Pan, T.C., Ground-motion attenuation relationship for the sumatran megathrust earthquakes (2010) Earthq.

[1] using two methods: the Levenberg-Marquard and Bruce-Force method. This modeling is particularly important in the case of seismicity. Given that it takes a good model for predicting the strength of earthquakes in order to reduce the risk of the impact of natural disasters. Two major contributions of this study are ground motion attenuation model specific to the subduction zone that has been optimized with the Levenberg-Marquard method and Bruce-Force uses a model Youngs et al. [1] and a proof that the Levenberg-Marquard method for optimization model is better than Bruce-Force method. The Levenberg-Marquardt method has been proven to provide more accurate results on the modeling of ground motion attenuation which is indicated by a very small deviation between the values of PGA predictable results with the PGA actual values. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",,"Computational methods; Disasters; Geophysics; Optimization; Earthquake ground motions; Force method; Ground-motion attenuations; Levenberg-Marquardt; Levenberg-Marquardt method; Natural disasters; Optimization modeling; Subduction zones; Earthquakes",,,,,"Acknowledgments.

The emerging deep learning techniques in the last decade coupled with the wide availability of massive weather observation data and the advent of information and computer technology have motivated many researches to explore hidden hierarchical pattern in the large volume of weather dataset for weather forecasting. This study investigates deep learning techniques for weather forecasting. In particular, this study will compare prediction performance of Recurrence Neural Network (RNN), Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (CRBM), and Convolutional Network (CN) models. Those models are tested using weather dataset provided by BMKG (Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics) which are collected from a number of weather stations in Aceh area from 1973 to 2009 and El-Nino Southern Oscilation (ENSO) data set provided by International Institution such as National Weather Service Center for Environmental Prediction Climate (NOAA).

This alternative arises due to many of the systems, which developed mostly by using microcontroller are not giving any room for customization to increase its performance or I/O ports. There is any possibility that the system designed to be used by using general processor such as PC to increase its performance but it will give another problem such as interface difficulty for high speed I/O, real time processing, increases complexity, and many more. Customization is introduced by combining hard IP processor and FPGA in one chip instead of practicing two separate devices, processor and FPGA, which is commonly use in high performance embedded design. This approach allows seamless design development and development time reduction for customization.","Customization; Embedded system; FPGA; Microcontroller; System-on-chip","Controllers; Embedded systems; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Microcontrollers; System-on-chip; As interfaces; Customization; Development time; Embedded designs; High speed I/O; Realtime processing; Seamless design; Separate devices; Integrated circuit design",,,,,,"Bohr, M., Mistry, K., (2011) ""Intel's revolutionary 22 nm transistor technology"", , Intel website; Smith, M.J., (1997) ""Application-specific integrated circuits""; Yiannacouras, P., Steffan, J.G., Rose, J., ""Application-specific customization of soft processor microarchitecture"" (2006) Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/SIGDA 14th international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays.

The problem is that live messenger runs under a network with limited security and therefore facing threats such as interception, authenticity, interruption and fabrication. The purpose of this research is to design security protocol on live messenger that ensures authenticity and data or message confidentiality whenever data/messages are sent from one user to another user. The protocol is designed to ensure that no one except the authorized user are allowed to communicate to each other. The proposed protocol is an end-to-end protocol, where each user can only comunicate once each of the user are authenticated and have secured connections to each other. The researcher is designing this end-to-end protocol and perform a simulation to show that the communcation line is secured. The result shows that the communication line established is secured and the user can send messages in confidential. It is also shown in the simulation that if a attacker tries to intercept, it will be aknowledged by the users and the attacker is blocked and not able to establish connection. © 2015 The Authors.

By looking at these requirements, a safer way to communicate, such as Cryptography, has been developed. However, the result of this method is not sufficient, because it still risk from the interception of the sent data, caused by cryptography which only hides the data resulting the packaging to be suspicious and draw attention of the hijackers. Therefore, Steganography then developed in which not only hides the content, but also deceptive hijackers with packaging that is not suspicious. In this paper, we discuss the design of steganography which is applied in mobile devices (e.g. mobile phone) using the BPCS (Bit-Plane Complexity Segmentation) by hiding text message into the media reservoir of JPEG data types images. When using this method the message hiding capacity is larger than any other method, up to 40% of the image container. The simulation result reconstructed images which is measured by an objective assessment parameters, based on the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio PSNR, with efficient value obtained on average is 74.3294 dB which is well worth the image quality. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Cryptography; Mobile device; PSNR; Steganography",,,,,,,"Cachin, C., (2005) Digital Steganography, , http://www.zurich.ibm.com/~cca/papers/encyc.pdf, Switzerland, Accessed on 30 December 2011; Bucklin, T., Davidson, C., Newman, D., Sergaves, J., Taylor, D., (2009) PSNR Quality Analysis Methodology, , http://techblog.cineform.com/, April 18, Accessed pada 20 Januari 2012; Chamorro, A.G.H., Miyatake, M.N., A new methodology of image steganalysis including for jpeg steganography (2010) Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics Conference (CERMA); Chen, Y.H., Huang, H.C., A copyright information embedding system for android platform (2011) Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing; Kawaguchi, E., (1999) A Research on Bit-Plane Complexity Segmentation Based Steganography, , Kyushu Institute of Technology; Kawaguchi, E., Eason, Richard.O., (1998) Principle and Applications of BPCS Steganography, , http://www.ece.umaine.edu/~eason/steg/SPIE98.pdf, Kitakyushu, Japan: Kyushu Institue of Technology.

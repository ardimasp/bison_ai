Face skin problems such as acne, comedo or wrinkles causes people to be insecure as well as a health hazard if it is not treated. This research is related to face skin disease, such as acne, blackheads or comedo, skin infection etc. In general, those diseases can become dangerous if it is not handled immediately. This research will facilitate user to determine the recommended treatments for this skin disease based on the symptoms, and the recommended medicines to treat the disease. The research include the analysis method through surveys, including interviews with several specialists who specializes in skin treatments and diseases. The data processing of patients’ is using fuzzy subtractive clustering algorithm to provide recommendation of treatments for the skin disease. After clustering and a series of inputs of symptoms, this research is able to provide an introduction of skin disease at the precision close to 100 percents and able to recommend correct treatments which is mostly the same as the treatment by a dermatologist. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT & LLS.

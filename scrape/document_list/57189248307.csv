When it comes to big-data, large scale tasks are executed with a huge amount of data being processed and optionally stored in persistent storage. One of leading innovation in alternative NoSQL and big data which enables low cost commodity hardware plays role is Redis, an in-memory database technology. Instead of disk, memory used in Redis is mainly to avoid latency during I/O processes. Big data processes require tons of I/O process on storage. This makes in-memory database run faster than conventional disk-optimized database. This research is an attempt to expose latency and improve performance by experimenting multi-thread approach during short message (SMS) delivery in single-thread Redis environment in combination with Rapidpro, a mass SMS management platform. © 2015 IEEE.","in-memory database; multi-thread; network latency; Redis; Short Message Service (SMS)","Computer hardware; Database systems; Digital storage; Hardware; Reconfigurable hardware; Text messaging; Memory database; Multi-thread; Network latencies; Redis; Short message services; Big data",,,,,"Paksula, M., (2010) Persisting Objects in Redis Key-Value Database, , http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/paksula/misc/redis.pdf, (White Paper) unpublished; (2015) Online Redis Website, , http://redis.io/topics/latency,accessedJune; Fan, B., Andersen, D.G., Kaminsky, M., MemC3: Compact and concurrent MemCache with dumber caching and smarter hashing (2013) Nsdi'13 Proceedings of the 10th USENIX Conference on Networked Systems Design and Implementation, pp. 371-384. , USENIX Association Berkeley; (2015) Libevent-an Event Notification Library, , June; (2015) Redis Benchmark Page, , http://redis.io/topics/benchmarksJune; Athanasaki, E., Anastopoulos, N., Kourtis, K., Koziris, N., Exploring the performance limits of simultaneous multithreading for scientific codes (2008) The Journal of Supercomputing, 44 (1), pp. 64-97. , April; Liu, T., Curtsinger, C., Berger, E.D., DTHREADS: Efficient deterministic multithreading (2011) SOSP '11 Proceedings of the Twenty-Third ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, pp. 327-336; How Fast is Redis, , http://redis.io/topics/benchmarks(AccessedJune2015, Redis Web; Emer, J., Hill, M.D., Patt, Y.N., Yi, J.J., Chiou, D., Sendag, R., Single-threaded vs. Multithreaded: Where should we focus (2007) Journal IEEE Micro, 27 (6), pp. 14-25. , November",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","7th International Conference on Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, ICITEE 2015","29 October 2015 through 30 October 2015",,119463,,9781467378635,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

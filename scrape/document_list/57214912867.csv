Observations and surveys were conducted vis-a-vis 48,013 toll-road users to determine the suitable OBU types and its potential contributions toward efficient tollgate queuing time. Subsequently, it is expected to concurrently determine the appropriate promotion tools that support toll-road users particularly in non-tapping payment system of OBU. House of Quality and V/C Ratio are the basis of the problem formulation in this research. The study shows that a flexible mount OBU device which displays its current available balance are desired by most toll-road users. Moreover, toll-road users expect the single piece microwave OBU device to be waterproof, heatproof, and durable. Comparing to e-card system, its usage reduces the queuing time by 50% to 60%. Additionally, the study shows that collaboration with gas station is the most appropriate promotion model. These research findings provide beneficial feedback for both toll-road authorities and related business stakeholders. © 2019, IEOM Society International.","Electronic tolls collection; House of quality;

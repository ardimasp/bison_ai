Major research questions pursued were: What is the influence of entrepreneurial process on the green business environment concept? What is the influence of cost effectiveness of membrane-based technology of the water system on the green business environment concept? What is the influence of entrepreneurial process on the sustainable competitive advantage of a pharmaceutical firm? What is the influence of cost effectiveness of membrane-based technology in a water system on the sustainable competitive advantage in a pharmaceutical firm? What is the influence of a green business environment concept on sustainable competitive advantage for a pharmaceutical firm? The research was conducted from a sample of 206 pharmaceutical member-firms of the Indonesian Pharmaceutical Association (GP FARMASI). The result of this research verified that the entrepreneurial process has a significant positive influence on the green business environment and sustainable competitive advantage. Furthermore, cost effectiveness also has significant positive influence on green business environment but has no significant influence on sustainable competitive advantage. Therefore, cost effectiveness and the entrepreneurial process membrane-based technology was suggested as an effective strategy to create a green business environment and achieve sustainable competitive advantage in the pharmaceutical industry. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt.

This study uses a quantitative approach with an explanatory design in accordance with the focus of the study, the population in this study is all e-wallet users in Indonesia. The sample selection uses a non-probability sampling method and a sample of 143 e-wallet users is used. The minimum number of samples is determined based on the number of research indicators. The method used in this study is multiple linear regression models with the help of the SPSS program. The results showed that trust and promotion partially had a significant effect on intention to use e-wallet. However, social influence does not significantly influence the intention to use e-wallet. For this reason it is suggested to the management to pay attention to these factors, by maintaining trust, paying attention to social factors and increasing promotion, it will have an impact on increasing intention to use e-wallets. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

To be effective, healthcare facilities are mandated to adopt knowledge management in the organization along with the support of the organizational structure and organizational culture within the organization. A private hospital in Tangerang is an example of the healthcare organization with a strong shared-value of professionalism, team-work, empathy, and love within the organization that has become their culture. This private hospital has implemented the knowledge management system and also has its organizational structure changed to be decentralized. Thus, this research aims to find the effect of implementing knowledge management and decentralization on organizational effectiveness which remains unknown. This research used quantitative research methodology in collecting and analyzing data by using SEM-PLS as data analyzing tool. This research conducted at the private hospital in Tangerang with a population of 300 system users. the sampling method used was non-probability purposive sampling. The sample size was determined using Slovin's formula. The survey was conducted of 179 valid respondents consisting of emergency unit personnel, nurses, medical support staff, and administration staff. This study found that Organizational Structure does not affect Organizational Effectiveness. Knowledge Management and Organizational Culture affect Organizational Effectiveness positively and significantly.

This study uses a quantitative approach with an explanatory design in accordance with the focus of the study, the population in this study is all e-wallet users in Indonesia. The sample selection uses a non-probability sampling method and a sample of 143 e-wallet users is used. The minimum number of samples is determined based on the number of research indicators. The method used in this study is multiple linear regression models with the help of the SPSS program. The results showed that trust and promotion partially had a significant effect on intention to use e-wallet. However, social influence does not significantly influence the intention to use e-wallet. For this reason it is suggested to the management to pay attention to these factors, by maintaining trust, paying attention to social factors and increasing promotion, it will have an impact on increasing intention to use e-wallets. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

One of the main reasons is when we figured out the number of Indonesian pharmaceutical industries in 2012 are kept reducing compare to the increasing numbers of Indonesian population growth. This strategy concept also might help the industries to reducing environmental pollution, and operational cost in pharmaceutical industries, by reducing of the chemical usage for water treatment process in floculation and cougulation and chlorination for sterillization. This new model is free usage of chemicals for purified water generation system process and sterilization. The concept offering of using membrane technology- Reverse Osmosis (RO) membrane base treatment to replace traditional chemical base treatment, following enhance Electrodeionization (EDI) as final polisher for controlling conductivity, and finally Ultra Violet (UV) disinfectant technology as final guard for bacteria controls instead of chemical base system in purified water generation system. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.","Free chemical; Membrane base treatment and enviromental pollution; Pharmaceutical industry; Purified water system",,,,,,,"(2010) Indonesia Pharmaceuticals & Healthcare Report Q3 2010, , Business Monitor International, Business Monitor International Ltd.

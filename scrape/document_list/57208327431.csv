The dimensions of work values include extrinsic values, intrinsic values, leisure, altruistic and social rewards. A total of 429 people were recruited for this study via an online survey. Statistical approaches, namely Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD), were used to analyse data obtained from the questionnaire. The ANOVA result indicated differences between the three generational cohorts in five work-values.

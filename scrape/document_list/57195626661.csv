Modified starch was prepared by two cycles of autoclaving followed by cooling at 4, and -20?C. The RS content was significantly higher (p < 0.05) after SC treatment as compared with native taro starch. All modified starches tend to be more stable to SC and heat- and shear-resistant of pasting characteristic which was confirmed by RVA viscograme. Moreover, the structure of modified taro starch granules showed remarkable different as compared to native as shown by the irregular and fracture of the structure. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Environmental technology; Granulation; Colocasia; Modified starches; Pasting characteristics; Pasting property; Resistant starch; Starch granules; Steam cooking; Starch",,,,"Kementerian Riset Teknologi Dan Pendidikan Tinggi Republik Indonesia

All indicators or system is reliable and has proven hat can bring profit for traders. Basically all indicator are reliable and tested which able to bring some profit to traders. Ironically there are many trader fail to gain the profit and became bankrupt. It because they has no well money management and good mentality in trading. Therefore in this study is focused on technical analysis by using weighted moving average which will be implemented on the mobile device so that it can give predictions on the price of the EURO-USD currency pair. The results is the weighted moving average was not quite accurate in determining the price of a currency especially during sideways price but it so accurate when they have strong price trend or large-scale. weighted moving average becomes really easy to apply when using 2 or more weighted moving average and able to give facility in analyzing movement of currency with the counterpart of EURO-USD by means of mobile medium. © 2014 Science Publications.","Mobile device; Technical analysis; Weighted moving average",,,,,,,"Eko, U., Analisis dan penilaian kinerja portofolio optimal saham-saham LQ-45 (2008) BISNIS Birokrasi J., 15, pp. 178-187; Endrosiwi, A., (2008) Forex Itu Mudah: Panduan Forex Untuk Orang Biasa, , Kampusforex; Marcelina Rizka Falevy, M.S., (2011) Sistem peramalan harga sembako berbasi moving average dengan brew platform sebagai mobile interface, , Surabaya: ITS; Needham, J., (2010) The currency wars of 2010, , Forex J.

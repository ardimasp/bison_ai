With the increasing access to Internet usage in society, public access to P2P lending applications will also be more open. It is proven by the significant increase of transactions in P2P lending applications in current years. Previous research has focused more on the phenomenon of P2P lending growth and its relation to the existing financial ecosystem, namely banking, and research that focuses more on MSMEs as P2P lending application users. Therefore, we see the need for research to find out what factors influence the intention to use P2P lending applications, including knowing the positive impact of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, trust, user innovation, and government support for attitude towards using the P2P lending applications, and the positive impact of attitude towards use for behavioral intention to use P2P lending applications. The study was conducted by taking a sample of 150 people who had never applied a P2P lending application and were domiciled in Greater Jakarta. The data analysis method used for hypothesis testing was Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results show that trust and user innovativeness factors have a positive effect on attitude towards using P2P lending applications and attitude towards use has a positive effect on behavioral intention to use P2P lending applications. Meanwhile, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and government support do not have a positive impact on attitude towards utilizing P2P lending applications. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

This study uses a quantitative approach with an explanatory design in accordance with the focus of the study, the population in this study is all e-wallet users in Indonesia. The sample selection uses a non-probability sampling method and a sample of 143 e-wallet users is used. The minimum number of samples is determined based on the number of research indicators. The method used in this study is multiple linear regression models with the help of the SPSS program. The results showed that trust and promotion partially had a significant effect on intention to use e-wallet. However, social influence does not significantly influence the intention to use e-wallet. For this reason it is suggested to the management to pay attention to these factors, by maintaining trust, paying attention to social factors and increasing promotion, it will have an impact on increasing intention to use e-wallets. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The analysis tool used is linear hierarchical model with SPSS version 22. The result showed Product Innovation has an influence on the competitiveness of the national helmet industry. Product Innovation will not improve competitiveness while Standardization SNI as a moderating variable influences negatively. SNI Standard should be more relied on industries condition and the market need, so SNI seems not be a solution to the industry to get competitiveness. © IJSTR 2019.","Competitiveness; Linear hierarchical model; Product innovation; Standardization SNI",,,,,,"Mu, J., Thomas, E., Peng, G., Di Benedetto, A., Strategic orientation and new product development performance: The role of networking capability and networking ability (2017) Ind.

This study uses a quantitative approach with an explanatory design in accordance with the focus of the study, the population in this study is all e-wallet users in Indonesia. The sample selection uses a non-probability sampling method and a sample of 143 e-wallet users is used. The minimum number of samples is determined based on the number of research indicators. The method used in this study is multiple linear regression models with the help of the SPSS program. The results showed that trust and promotion partially had a significant effect on intention to use e-wallet. However, social influence does not significantly influence the intention to use e-wallet. For this reason it is suggested to the management to pay attention to these factors, by maintaining trust, paying attention to social factors and increasing promotion, it will have an impact on increasing intention to use e-wallets. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

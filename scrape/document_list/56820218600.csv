Using a sample of Asian listed banks, we document that banks with higher charter value exhibit lower systemic risk because these banks hold more capital. Nevertheless, we find that the self-disciplining role of charter value in banking is more pronounced for countries with lower depth of credit information sharing. Specifically, our findings also reveal that higher charter value alleviates systemic risk and increases capitalization, particularly in countries with lower quality of private credit bureaus. These findings suggest that higher charter value can be detrimental for financial stability due to an increase in bank systemic risk, particularly when private credit bureaus are of better quality. In order to overcome bank systemic risk, this paper advocates the importance of strengthening bank competition to limit charter value, in addition to promoting the development of private credit bureaus. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Asia-Pacific; Bank charter value; Credit information sharing; Systemic risk",,,,,,,"Acharya, V., Richardson, M., (2009) Restoring Financial Stability: How to Repair a Failed System, 542. , John Wiley & Sons; Adams, C., Emerging East Asian Banking System: Ten Years After the 1997/98 Crisis (2008), ADB Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No.16; Adrian, T., Brunnermeier, M.K., “CoVaR,” NBER Working Papers 17454 (2011), National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc; Agusman, A., Monroe, G.S., Gasbarro, D., Zumwalt, J.K., Accounting and capital market measures of risk: evidence from Asian banks during 1998–2003 (2008) J.

Fifty-eight companies were taken as samples, selected through industrial classification and selection criteria of leader and follower stocks. The data is analysed using Vector Auto Regression method to extrapolate and investigate the existence of lead-lag effects in Indonesian capital market. This study finds that returns to stocks with relatively high market capitalizations lead returns to stocks with relatively low market capitalizations in Indonesian industry portfolios. However, out of ten industries, there are only six who contribute significant result. This research concludes that lead-lag effects do exist in certain industries and it may assist investors in managing the trading strategy. Indonesian capital market is not efficient since lead-lag effects is one of the phenomenon, which against the EMH.","Cross-correlation; Indonesia Stock Exchange; Lead-lag effects; Stock Returns",,,,,,,"Boudoukh, J., Richardson, M.P., Whitelaw, R.F., Tale of three schools: Insights of autocorrelations of short-horizon stock returns (1995) Review of Financial Studies, 7 (3), pp. 539-573; Conrad, J., Kaul, G., Time variation in expected returns (1988) The Journal of Business, 61 (4), pp. 409-425; Fama, E., Permanent and temporary components of stock prices (1988) Journal of Political Economy, 96 (2), pp. 246-273; Fama, E.F., Efficient capital market, II (1991) The Journal of Finance, 46 (5), pp. 1575-1617; Gultekin, M.N., Gultekin, N.B., Stock market seasonality: International evidence (1983) Journal of Financial Economics, 12 (4), pp. 469-481; Haque, T., Lead-lag effects in Australian industry portfolios (2010) The Journal of Finance, 18 (3), pp. 267-290; Hou, K., Industry information diffusion and the lead-lag effects in stock returns (2007) Review of Financial Studies, 20 (4), pp. 1113-1138; Lo, A., Mackinlay, A., When are contrarian profits due to stock market overreaction?

To fulfill the objective, the “blue chip” Indonesian companies are chosen. The research data period is 2007–2011 and taken quarterly. Technical analysis uses previous quarter return to predict current quarter returns. Fundamental analysis uses operating cash flow and price-to-book ratio. Integrated analysis combines these three variables to test the combined predictive power over current quarter stock returns. The results are compared using multiple regression analysis. Change in price-to-book ratio is significant and can help predict stock returns while previous quarter returns do not have predictive power of the next quarter returns, possibly due to the volatility in Indonesian market. Operating cash flow, while important, does not have predictive power over stock returns, possibly due to it not being an important factor in making investment decisions in Indonesia. Potential investors should understand Price-to-Book ratio and use it in any analysis concerning stock returns. They should also be prudent not to make investment decisions based on historical stock returns. Operating cash flow-generating ability is not one of the indicators the market watches out for. Integrated analysis outperforms a purely technical analysis, but not a purely fundamental analysis. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

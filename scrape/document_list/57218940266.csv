The study is a case study in an instant concrete manufacturer seeking ways to improve its process in order to win its market share. The study used Kansei engineering approach in capturing what customer's wants. The generated customer attributes were then measured and benchmarked against two competitors. SIPA grid was used to group the attributes into cluster of importance. Based on SIPA grid clustering, house of quality was built, and technical attributes were generated as action plans for improvement. The results recommended the studied company to focus on top five action plans, namely 'computerised system to ensure quality', 'bulk pricing', 'bundle promotion', and '1 × 24 hours on time delivery system'.

Recently, a new method within the field of computational intelligence, i.e. Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LSSVM), has been investigated on its performance in predicting stock/index price. LSSVM algorithm itself is introduced as a modified version of SVM algorithm, where the computational complexity of Quadratic Programming (QP) problem in SVM is overcome by solving a set of linear equations instead. In this research, an LSSVM model is built to predict the daily close price of Jakarta Composite Index (JCI). As a comparison, other prediction models are built, namely SVM and ARIMA model which respectively represent the commonly used intelligent and conventional model. Experimental results show that LSSVM model outperforms SVM and ARIMA model in predicting the JCI close price. © 2005-2014 JATIT & LLS.

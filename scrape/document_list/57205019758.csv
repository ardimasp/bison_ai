One way to achieve company's objectives is by optimization process production without reducing the quality of the product. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to maximize production volume for providing customer's demands, maximize sales revenue, minimize production cost and maximize machine's working hour cost. The method used in this research is Goal Programming without priority and with weighted priority and applied to LINGO software version 17. From the calculation of the two methods of Goal Programming, Goal Programming method without priority is the most optimal for production planning at PT XYZ, because it can improve the efficiency for machine's working hours and production cost, thus the sales revenue increased by 404.69%. It will affect and give a good impact on the company for business development. As a result, this research showed that the define objectives achieved optimally. © 2018 IEEE.","goal programming manufacturing industry; optimization production process planning","Efficiency; Information management; Linear programming; Manufacture; Multiobjective optimization; Planning; Production control; Sales; Business development; Goal programming; LINGO softwares; Manufacturing industries; Production cost; Production Planning; Production process; Production volumes; Costs",,,,,"Paath, P.C., Dundu, J.T., Analisis pengendalian bahan proyek pembangunan dengan metode goal programming Prioritas (Studi Kasus: Proyek Pembangunan Gedung Sekolah Eben Haezar) (2015) Jurnal Sipil Statik, 3 (5), pp. 351-360. , Mei; Anggraeni, W., Vinarti, R.A., Tyasnurita, R., Permatasari, J., Production planning optimization using goal programming method in habibah busana (2015) Journal of Advanced Management Science, 3 (4), pp. 270-275. , December; Kamran, M.A., Karimi, B., Bakhtiari, H., Masoumzadeh, S., A resource allocation model in a healthcare emergency center using goal programming (2016) Journal of Engineering Research, 4 (4), pp. 81-97. , December; Anwar, S., Afrizalmi, L., Optimization of production planning using goal programming method (a case study in a cement industry) (2015) The International Conference Mathematics, Science, and Technology (ICOMSET), pp. 126-131. , October; Halima, B.A., Karimb, H.A., Fahamic, N.A., Mahadd, N.F., Nordine, S.K., Hassan, N., Bank financial statement management using a goal programming model (2015) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 211, pp. 498-504. , November; Siew, L.W., Wai, C.J., Hoe, L.W., Data driven decision analysis in bank financial management with goal programming model (2017) International Visual Informatics Conference, pp. 681-689. , Springer, Cham, November; Chen, J.W., Lam, W.S., Lam, W.H., Optimization on the financial management of the bank with goal programming model (2017) Journal of Fundamental and Applied Sciences, 9 (6), pp. 442-451; Hassan, N., A preemptive goal programming for allocating students into academic departments of a faculty (2016) International Journal of Mathematical Models and Methods in Applied Sciences, 10, pp. 166-170; Devani, V., Optimasi perencanaan produksi dengan menggunakan metode goal programming (2013) Jurnal Sains Dan Teknologi Industri, 11 (1). , Desember; Render, B., Stair, R.M., Jr., Hanna, M.E., Hale, T.S., (2018) Quantitative Analysis for Management.

The government has an important role in economic growth. However, there are still many civil servants who abuse their positions to do corruption. The central government should pay more attention to each region to avoid corruption cases. For developing a mapping system, Naïve Bayes classifier is needed to classify news about corruption and non-corruption. N-Gram and Hash Table were used to map corruption cases based on Indonesia’s administrative territory. The experimental results showed that Naïve Bayes classification achieved 100% accuracy for training and testing. However, N-Gram and Hash Table achieved 85% accuracy for mapping the location of the article. © 2018 ICIC International.","Corruption; Corruption perception index; Indonesia; System development",,,,,,"(2014), http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/indonesia/overview; (2017), http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/GDP.pdf; Noerlina, L.A.W., Sasmoko, A.M.M., Alamsyah, M., Corruption cases mapping based on Indonesia’s corruption perception index (2017) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 801 (1); (2017), http://www.corruptionwatch.org.za/learn-about-corruption/what-is-corruption/our-definition-of-corruption; Siddique, M., Ghosh, R., (2014) Corruption, Good Governance and Economic Development: Contemporary Analysis and Case Studies, , World Scientific Publishing, Singapore; (2009), https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/the_anti_corruption_plain_language_guide; Shah, A., Schacter, M., Combinating corruption: Look before you leap (2004) Finance Development, 4, pp. 40-43; Mauro, P., Why Worry about Corruption?

Nevertheless, there are still many occurrences of government officers abusing their offices to do an act of corruption. In this order, the central government should pay attention to every area in the nation to avoid corruption case. Meanwhile, the news media always constantly preach about corruption case, this makes the news media relevant for being one of the sources of measurement of corruption perception index (CPI). It is required to map the corruption case in Indonesia so the central government can pay attention to every region in Indonesia. To develop the mapping system, researchers use Naïve Bayes Classifier to classify which news articles talk about corruption and which news articles are not, before implementing a Naïve Bayes Classifier there are some text processing such as tokenizing, stopping, and stemming. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Economics; Mapping; Sodium; Text processing; Bayes Classifier; Central government; Corruption perception indices; Economic growths; Mapping systems; News articles; News media; Tokenizing; Crime",,,,,"Ghosh, R., Siddique, M., (2014) Corruption, Good Governance and Economic Development: Contemporary Analysis and Case Studies.; Huang, J., Lu, J., Ling, C., (2003) Comparing Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and SVM with AUC and Accuracy.; Jang, S., Woo, W., 5W1H: Unified User-Centric Context (2005) Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing.; Malik, D., (2001) Dari Konstruksi Ke Dekonstruksi: Refleksi Atas Pemberitaan Televisi Kita.; Melgar, N., Rossi, M., Smith, T.W., The Perception of Corruption (2010) International Journal of Public Opinion Research, 22 (1), pp. 120-131; Murphy, K.P., (2006) Naive Bayes Classifiers Generative Classifiers, 4701, pp. 1-8; Olteanu, A., Peshterliev, S., Liu, X., Aberer, K., Web Credibility: Features Exploration and Credibility Prediction (2013) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), pp. 557-568; Persson, A., Rothstein, B., Teorell, J., Why Anti Corruption Reforms Fail - Systemic Corruption as a Collective Action Problem (2013) Governance, 26 (3), pp. 449-471; Rahimi, R., Shakeri, H., Reflection on Judicial System's Corruption and Offering Solutions to Promote its Safety (2016) Journal of Politics and Law, 9 (9), p. 187; Rohwer, A., Measuring Corruption: A Comparison between the Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index and the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators (2009) DICE, pp. 42-52; Schrenk, M., (2007) Webbots, Spiders, and Screen Scrapers.; Tala, F., (2003) A Study of Stemming Effects on Information Retrieval in Bahasa Indonesia; Tated, R.R., Ghonge, M.M., A survey on text mining - Techniques and application (2015) International Journal of Research in Advent Technology, 1, pp. 380-385; Uca, N., Ince, H., Sumen, H., The Mediator Effect of Logistics Performance Index on the Relation between Corruption Perception Index and Foreign Trade Volume (2016) European Scientific Journal, 12 (25), pp. 1857-7881; Yang, J.M., Cai, R., Wang, C., Huang, H., Zhang, L., Ma, W.Y., Incorporating Site-Level Knowledge for Incremental Crawling of Web Forums: A List-Wise Strategy (2009) Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1375-1383",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Computing and Applied Informatics, ICCAI 2016","14 December 2016 through 15 December 2016",,127044,17426588,,,,"English","J.

To realize it the system needs to be built which in this study is called the Corruption Early Prevention (CEP) as a Decision Support System for President of the Republic of Indonesia. This study aims to examine 1) how is the construct of the Corruption Early Prevention as a Decision Support System for President of the Republic of Indonesia?, and 2) how is the design form of the system of Corruption Early Prevention as a Decision Support System for President of Republic of Indonesia? The research method is using Neuro-Research which is the collaboration of qualitative and quantitative research methods and the model development of Information Technology (IT). The research found that: 1) the construct of CEP is theoretically feasible, valid and reliable by content to be developed in the context of the prevention of corruption in Indonesia as an early prevention system that diagnoses Indonesia simultaneously and in real time, and 2) the concept of system design and business process of CEP is predicted to be realized in the IT-based program. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Artificial intelligence; Crime; Program diagnostics; Business Process; Design forms; Early warning; Model development; Prevention systems; Quantitative research methods; Real time; research methods; Decision support systems",,,,,"Akbar, Y., Vukan, V., Explaining corruption: The role of national culture and its implications for international management (2014) Cross Cultural & Strategic Management, pp. 191-218. , (2014); Alexander, R., The role of whistleblowers in the fight against economic crime (2006) Journal of Financial Crime, pp. 131-138. , (2006); Bastin, G., Townsend, P., Whistleblowers - A Legitimate Role in Corporate Life?

The 3D model of the serpentine robot is drawed in Autocad Inventor ® and exported to SimMechanics® for straighforward modeling of the kinematics. The gaits are important for robots designed to explore ruins of disasters where the working spaces are very tight. For maximum flexibility of the serpentine robot, we adopted a joint design with three parallel actuators, where the joint is capable of linear movement in the forward axis, and rotational movements around two other axes. The designed linear expansion gaits is calculated for forward movement when the robot is posing straight or turning laterally. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,"Murphy, R.R., Trial by fire (2004) IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine, 11 (3), pp. 50-61; Hopkins, J.K., Spranklin, B., Gupta, S., (2009) A Survey of Snake-inspired Robot Designs, 4, p. 2; Kinagasa, T., Otani, I., Haji, T., Yoshida, K., Osuka, K., Amano, H., Flexible Monothread Mobile Track (FMT) - A new mobile mechanism using one track and vertebral structure (2010) Robotics 2010: Current and Future Challenges, pp. 241-259; Borenstein, J., Hansen, M., Borrell, A.M., The OmniThread OT-4 serpentine robot - Design and performance (2007) Journal of Field Robotics, pp. 601-621; Behrens, R., Kuchler, C., Forster, T., Elkmann, N., Kinematik analysis of a 3-DOF joint for a novel hyper-redundant robot arm (2011) IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 3224-3229; Ohno, H., Hirose, S., Design of Slim Slime Robot and its Gait of Locomotion (2001) IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pp. 707-715",,,"","EDP Sciences","2013 International Conference on Advances Science and Contemporary Engineering, ICASCE 2013","23 October 2013 through 24 October 2013","Jakarta",,21016275,,,,"English","EPJ Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901423047

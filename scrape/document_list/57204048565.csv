Therefore, the higher education institutions demand the lecturers also supporting staff to acquire aligned behaviors in organizational citizenship and knowledge management. This research aims to measure organization citizenship behavior (OCB) and knowledge management behavior (KMB) of supporting staff in a higher education institution. The research was conducted at the Bina Nusantara University, especially supporting staff at Kemanggisan Campus Jakarta. Organizational citizenship behavior as the independent variable is reflected perfectly into five dimensions - altruism, civic virtue, consciousness, courtesy, and sportsmanship. Knowledge management behavior as the dependent variable is reflected perfectly into three dimensions: knowledge creation, knowledge sharing, and knowledge update. The measurement and structural model developed by using SmartPLS explain that OCB has a positive and significant impact on KMB. The results of statistical tests show that female supporting staffs more than five years of service has a higher score in OCB and KMB significantly. © 2020 IEEE.","Demographic characteristics; Human capital; ICT; Knowledge management behavior; Organizational citizenship behavior; Organizational learning; Social web","Behavioral research; Human resource management; Dependent variables; Higher education institutions; Independent variables; Knowledge creations; Knowledge-sharing; Organizational citizenship behaviors; Quality of education; Structural modeling; Knowledge management",,,,,"Nonaka, I., Toyama, R., The theory of the knowledge-creating firm: Subjectivity, objectivity and synthesis (2005) Ind.

This study aims to examine work engagement holistically and attempts to find out the impactful antecedents of work engagement in multiple layer perspectives of organizational behaviour. The main concern of this research is to answer the following question, “does coping stress of the millennials, digital leadership of the direct supervisor, and learning culture in a business organization have positive impact significantly on work engagement?”. The study was involved 317 millennials from three big business organisations in Indonesia. The study results conclude that work engagement of millennial in Indonesia can be defined holistically by considering physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual dimensions. Engaging the millennials to work at the office can be improved by developing millennials’ capability in coping stress, supervisor’s capability in leading digitally, and enabling learning culture as corporate culture in the business organization. © 2020, Czestochowa University of Technology.

A total of 67 respondents, mostly senior managers and directors, were recruited for this study They work for leading companies in Indonesia in sectors such as ICT, manufacturing, media, construction and developer, banking, and service. The results of statistical data analysis reveals that learning culture has an indirect effect on work engagement but a direct impact on learning agility. Learning agility also has a positive and significant effect on work engagement. Learning agility plays a mediating role in the relationship between work engagement and learning culture.

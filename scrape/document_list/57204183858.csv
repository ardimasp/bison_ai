Blended learning refers to combining traditional classroom learning with e-learning with the aims to enrich entire learning process. From the last decade, we have seen the strong growth of millenials students in Indonesian higher education institutions. They developed high familiarity with Internet technology, social media and smartphone uses. The needs of adopting social media into blended learning has become essential part in blended learning mode nowadays. For this reason, the article takes a popular method, Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) enables to enrich the entire e-learning environment. We apply the VLE dashboard with adopting the Web-based Synchronized Multimedia Lecture (WSML) framework that enables to provide authoring tool to record the temporal and spatial relationships among media involved and facilitate synchronize presentation across media access. This framework has advantages to promote the real-time collaboration amongst students and teacher(s), like in a classroom setting, but with online mode. VLE takes advantages of web 2.0 and social media technology that enables to conduct real time meeting with video conference and easy exchange multimedia files. The outcome of the article is expected to provide social media learning based system that can be apply in higher education institutions to avoid boredom in traditional blended learning. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Computer aided instruction; Electronic document exchange; Multimedia services; Social networking (online); Students; Teaching; Classroom settings; E-learning environment; Effective learning; Higher education institutions; Internet technology; Real-time collaboration; Temporal and spatial; Virtual learning environments; E-learning",,,,,"Bhutawale, S., Sakharkar, P., What Is E-Learning?; Riahi, G., E-learning systems based on cloud computing: A review (2015) Procedia Comput Sci., 62, pp. 352-359. , Scse; Gikas, J., Grant, M.M., Mobile computing devices in higher education: Student perspectives on learning with cellphones, smartphones & social media (2013) Internet High Educ., 19, pp. 18-26; Hassanzadeh, A., Kanaani, F., Elahi, S., A model for measuring e-learning systems success in universities (2012) Expert Syst Appl., 39 (12), pp. 10959-10966; Mason, R., Rennie, F., E-Learning and Social Networking Handbook (2008) British Journal of Educational Technology, 40, p. 189; Gibson, L.A., Sodeman, W.A., Millennials and technology: Addressing the communication gap in education and practice (2014) Organ Dev J., 32, pp. 63-75; Lister, M., Trends in the Design of E-Learning and Online Learning (2014) J Online Learn Teach., 10, pp. 671-680; Al-Adwan, A., Al-Adwan, A., Smedley, J., Exploring students acceptance of e-learning using Technology Acceptance Model in Jordanian universities (2013) Int J Educ Dev Using Inf Commun Technol., 9, pp. 4-18; Zakarian, S., (2013) Abstract Education and Social Media: An Examination of Facebook, Twitter and Youtube in K-12 Education, , May 2013; Scholar, M.D., Thoene, W.S., (2012) The Impact of Social Networking Sites on College Students' Consumption Patterns; Panekham, A., (2014) Exploring the Role Social Media Plays in the Student Learning Experience of 2014 University Life in NZ, p. 79. , November; Scott, K.M., Does a university teacher need to change e-learning beliefs and practices when using a social networking site?

Organization that has lack of IT governance also experiences lack of good corporate governance. As a result, the organization has difficulties to link its IT benefits to organization's objectives. In some cases, the lack of IT governance even causes severe impacts to school management. The article takes case of a higher institution, STMIK MBM, one of popular IT school in North Sulawesi, that has experienced with frequent IT interruption. The frequent IT interruption has caused severe consequences not only to current school operation, but also to the reputation of the school. In the beginning year of 2017, the ineffective academic data management has caused the severe interruption of school operation and led to the change of school management. To promote IT good governance, the new school director has initiative to apply COBIT 5, as an effective IT governance framework for the school. The article provides an analysis of COBIT 5 implementation with the objectives to provide a reference for major school stakeholders to understand and develop effective business and IT policy. The outcome is expected to provide insight of good IT governance for higher education institution. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Condensed matter physics; Engineering; Industrial engineering; Materials science; Corporate governance; Good governances; Higher education; Higher education institutions; IT governance; IT policies; Information management",,,,,"Yanosky, R., Caruso, J.B., Process and politics: IT governance in higher education (2008) ECAR Key Find.; Paradeise, C., Reale, E., Bleiklie, I., Ferlie, E., (2009), (Springer: University governance); Al, O.L., Barnes, P.H., Pitman, G., Optimising COBIT 5 for IT Governance: Examples from the Public Sector (2012) Appl Theor Inf Syst Res., pp. 2-14; Adikara, F., Implementasi Tata Kelola Teknologi Informasi Perguruan Tinggi Berdasarkan Cobit 5 Pada Laboratorium Rekayasa Perangkat Lunak (2013) J Tek Inform Univ Esa Unggul., pp. 1-6; Kaban, I.E., Tata kelola teknologi informasi (2009) CommIT., 3, pp. 1-5; Macgregor, S., (2011) COBIT 5 and TOGAF 9.

The internal threat is predominantly the result of poor employee behavior towards organization’s information security policy. If users do not comply with information security policy, security solutions lose their efficacy. The information security policy serves as a tool to provide direction on how to manage and secure all organizational operations including critical assets, infrastructure, people, and process in organizations. A major challenge for organizations is encouraging employees to comply with information security policy. The objective of this paper is to develop a model for investigating the critical factors that influence employee compliance with information security policy based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Some researchers have extended TAM to include additional factors that influence behavior. In order to develop the model, we conducted a literature review and a discussion with the information security experts from the Government and Higher Education Institutions. The factors that affect employee compliance with organization’s information security policy have been identified. Through this study, we find that the TAM can be used to develop a model for investigating employee compliance with Information Security Policy by extended it with organizational and national cultures. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Employee security behavior; Information security policy; National culture; Organizational culture; Technology acceptance model","Personnel; Security of data; Security systems; Conceptual frameworks; Confidential information; Government institutions; Higher education institutions; Information security policies; National cultures; Organizational cultures; Technology acceptance model; National security",,,,,"Nugraha, Y., (2015) Ian Brown, , An adaptive wideband delphi method to study state cyber-defence requirements, IEEE, Ashwin Sasongko Sastrosubroto; (2014) Indonesia Government Computer Security Incident Response Team, , security incident report; (2014) Best Practices in Email, , Osterman Research, Inc, Web and Social Media Security; Li, H., Zhang, J., Sarathy, R., (2009) Understanding Compliance with Internet Use Policy from the Perspective of Rational Choice Theory, , Decision Support Systems, Elsevier; van Kessel, P., (2008) Moving beyond compliance—ernt and Young Global Information Security Survey; Al-Omari, A., El-Gayar, O., Deokar, A., Security policy compliance: User acceptance perspective.

Fundamentally, R shows the last transaction, F is the number of transactions, and M represents a total amount of expenses. It has often been applied and provides an effective analysis for decision makers to promote their product strategies. However, this is considered not able to accommodate the segmentation needs of banking customers; thus customer balance should be involved in the analysis process theoretically. The customer balance (B) is potentially able to be functioned for the customer segmentation process and fruitful in marketing strategies. The developed model is called the recency-frequency-monetary-balance (RFM+B) model. It is a segmentation model of bank’s customer considering four aspects: recency, frequency, monetary, and balance, where it is developed by using main method K-Means. The constructed model is applied successfully in one bank’s 65 thousand customers coming from 147 thousand transaction data in period of the first half of 2017: cash payments, cash deposits, over-booking, and transactions through ATMs. The result shows that clusters 0 until 3 are dominantly filled by customers with high R (with average 113.17 times), high B (with average 3,487,790,000 Indonesian rupiah), high F (with 315.73 times), and high M (with average 5,000,000,000 Indonesian rupiah) respectively. © 2021 ICIC International.","Bank’s customers; Customer segmentation; K-Means; RFM+B model; Segmentation model",,,,,"Binus University","We would like to thank BINUS University who has supported our works, particularly BINUS Graduate Program, Master of Computer Science.","Kustina, K.

To utilize the information, they have in order to be a competitive advantage winner is reasonably very crucial for the company. At present, the company does not only focus on the company's strategy that prioritizes products (e.g. product or service oriented), however also necessitates to focus on the company's strategy in prioritizing customers. Customer segmentation, its attributes, and the appropriate analysis method are going to get accurate data segmentation results, so that it is able to be used as a reference by the company and as a basis for determining its products' marketing strategies. This systematic literature review discusses the types of attributes operated, including customer balance attributes, whether or not they can be included in segmentation. In addition, it also discusses what popular analytical methods are widely used in the customer segmentation process. Literature searching in the digital library resulted in a total are 592,363, 1,361, and 21 papers respectively in the first, second, and third stage. 10 papers found finally in the final stage that were considered capable of answering research questions. Based on 10 papers selected, it can be concluded that customer balances can be functioned scientifically as one of attributes for segmentation use. The popular analytic methods operated for customer segmentation are recency, frequency, monetary (RFM) model (4 times appeared), K-Means algorithm (6 times occurred), and C-Means (2 times emerged). © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

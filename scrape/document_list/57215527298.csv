However, in term of location and patient's right for changing the practical doctor, then the patient when moving from one practical doctor to others will have similar and repeated questions such as medicine allergy, history of diseases and so on. Moreover, become a problem for a vulnerable patient such as unconscious patient, disabled or elderly when seeing a new practical doctor and at the end of the day, it will become malpractice. Few of the causes of the problem above are the lack of health education, delay in diagnosing/misdiagnosis, and inaccessible healthcare facilities and with the increasing popularity of telemedicine and IoT across the world, then we need to apply IoT in order to help the patient. In this paper, a framework is created and designed for an IoT-integrated mobile application for the patient where this mobile application is expected to be implemented. © 2019 IEEE.","Electronic Health Record; Electronic Medical Record; Mobile patient application","Internet of things; Medical computing; Mobile computing; Telemedicine; Electronic health record; Electronic medical record; End of the days; Health education; Healthcare facility; Mobile applications; Vulnerable patients; Diagnosis",,,,,"Debora, Y., (2017) Indeks Kesehatan Indonesia Masih Sangat Rendah, , https://tirto.id/indeks-kesehatan-indonesia-masih-sangat-rendah-cBRn, (December 17).

The objective of this study is to elaborate research on food industry and its competitive strategy through perspectives of Industrial Engineering (IE) and Doctor of Research in Management (DRM). The mentioned competitive strategy requires the Human Resources Management (HRM) and the integration of Resource-Based View (RBV) and Dynamic Capability (DC). The HRM are supported by the research deployment of Chadwick, Super and Kwoon pertaining Strategic Human Resources Management (SHRM). Meanwhile, the SHRM involves the Resource Orchestration of Company's CEO, Top Management Team (TMT) and employees; through various literatures of management's value on HRM by Bae and Lawler, Bennet, Ketchen and Schultz, Osterman and CEO's supports on HRM by Sheehan. Furthermore, both RBV and DC are supported by prior research by Kruasoma and Saenchaiyathon that enhanced the Resources Based Theory (RBT) by Barney and Clark and Bromiley and Rau; similarly, the DC and Strategic Management (SM) is enhanced by Teece. Processing and data analysis in this study refers to Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using SmartPLS Software and its questionnaire. As the perspectives of Industrial Engineering (IE), this study elaborates the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for Decision Hierarchy and Malcolm Baldrige Criteria (MBC) for Performance Excellence (PE). Furthermore as the perspectives of DRM, this study elaborates SEM in term of analysis of antecedents, behaviors and consequences. The questionnaire refers to the variable of Leadership (LDRSHP), Organizational Learning (ORGLRN), Innovation (INNOVA) and Performance (PERFRM), through their constructs and indicators. Those variables are the base of one of this studies researchers Khristian Edi Nugroho Soebandrija's draft of dissertation study. Yet, this study provides different approach as compared to the mentioned dissertation. © Medwell Journals, 2016.","Competitive strategy; Doctor of Research in Management (DRM); Food industry; Industrial engineering (IE); SmartPLS; Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)",,,,,,"Andrews, S., (2013) Food and Beverage Service: A Training Manual, p. 379. , Tata McGraw-Hill Education, New Delhi, India; Bae, J., Lawler, J.J., Organizational and FfRM strategies in Korea: Impact on firm performance in an emerging economy (2000) Acad.

These memes can be easily found in various social media platforms. This analysis further explores internet memes as expression tool to mimic or mock one's situation. The analyzed memes are internet memes that have been circulating for the past years and are still used today. This study was conducted using the postmodern psychology theory along with a survey on internet memes and mental state. The analysis found that internet memes can be divided into three categories of self-reflective memes based on the postmodern psychology theory. All three categories believe in the existence of the other ""self"", another part of a human that cannot be separated but is different than the person. Some of the categories reference the mental health issues that the users may have. The study also found that 70% of college students in Jakarta have experienced anxiety and/or depression symptoms while 47% of these students believe that looking at self-reflective internet memes help ease their symptoms. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Physics; College students; Jakarta; Mental health; Mental state; Popular cultures; Social media platforms; Three categories; Students",,,,,,"Bauckhage, C., Insights into Internet Memes (2011) Proceedings of the Fifth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, pp. 42-49; Lyotard, J.F., (1984) The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge, , (Manchester: Manchester Univerity Press); Barry, P., (2009) Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory, p. 81. , (Manchester: Manchester University Press); Anderson, W.T., (1990) Reality Isn't What It Used to Be: Theatrical Politics, Ready-to-Wear Religion, Global Myths, Primitive Chic, and Other Wonders of the Postmodern World, , (New York: HarperCollins); Shifman, L., (2014) Memes in Digital Culture, p. 30. , (Cambridge: The MIT Press); Andreassen, C.S., Griffiths, M.D., Demetrovics, Z., Pallesen, S., Billieux, J., Kuss, D., Mazzoni, E., The relationship between addictive use of social media and video games and symptoms of psychiatric disorders: A large-scale cross-sectional study (2016) Psychology of Addictive Behaviors, 30 (2), pp. 252-262",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Advance and Scientific Innovation, ICASI 2018","23 April 2018 through 24 April 2018",,148653,17426588,,,,"English","J.

Due to the many kyara, many ways are used by authors of Japanese fiction. One of the ways is by putting a catch phrase at the end of a dialog in a kyara. This kind of catch phrase is called kyaragobi. The method that is used in this research is qualitative method combined with descriptive analysis. The purpose of the research is to prove that kyaragobi to be more than just a catch phrase, but instead as a more significant supporting element to an identity of a kyaragobi's distinctive character, especially in digital era. Based on the analysed questionnaires, kyaragobi gives a different representation related to the catch phrase of a kyara. By using a kyaragobi, an identity of a kyara becomes more distinctive compared to other similar kyaras. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Physics; Descriptive analysis; Digital era; Qualitative method; Surveys",,,,"Binus University","This research paper was funded by the research grant from Bina Nusantara University","Dharma, H., (2015) Perbedaan Penulisan Dalam Manga Gaya Bahasa Lama-Baru Berkaitan Dengan Penggunaan Yakuwarigo Dan Kyaragobi, pp. 110-111. , (Depok: Universitas Indonesia); Hiroyuki, A., (2011) Japan Kingdom of Characters, p. 3. , (Tokyo: Insho-sha); Kinsui, S., (2003) Vacharu Nihongo: Yakuwarigo No Nazo, p. 205. , (Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten); Kinsui, S., (2013) Nihon Kenkyuu Dai Juu Yon - Kyarakutaa to ""douissei"", p. 5. , (Osaka: Osaka University); Sadanobu, T., (2007) Kyarajoshi Ga Arawareru Kankyou, pp. 34-35. , (Tokyo: Kurosio); Sadanobu, T., Characters (2015) Japanese Communication and Language: An Overview Acta Linguistica Asiatica, 5, pp. 10-11; Tuskamoto, A., (2007) Character and Japanese Reason to Need Character Animated Cartoon Character, p. 4. , (Tokyo: Tokyo University)",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Advance and Scientific Innovation, ICASI 2018","23 April 2018 through 24 April 2018",,148653,17426588,,,,"English","J.

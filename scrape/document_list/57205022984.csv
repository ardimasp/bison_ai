The purpose of this study is to describe the process of analysis and identification of the existing knowledge management in the IT consulting company and it propose the design of knowledge management system that can be developed by the company to overcome the existing knowledge problems. In this paper, the authors use the interview method to get the needs and problems of the current system at one of the IT consultant companies as the object of case study, then design the knowledge management system based on knowledge taxonomy and use case diagram. From this research we can conclude that the design of knowledge management system basically can be done easily and quickly, as long as the existing problem analysis has been presented clearly and in a detailed manner. © 2018 IEEE.","case study; design; knowledge; knowledge management; system","Design; Knowledge based systems; Existing problems; IT companies; IT consulting companies; knowledge; Knowledge management system; Knowledge taxonomies; system; Use case diagram; Knowledge management",,,,,"Authors, F., (2018) Knowledge Management for Construction Organisations : A Research Agenda; Authors, F., (2016) VINE Journal of Information and Knowledge Management Systems; Masadeh, R., Shannak, R., Maqableh, M., Tarhini, A., The impact of knowledge management on job performance in higher education (2017) J.

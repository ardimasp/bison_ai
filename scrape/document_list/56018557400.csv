Although the government has done some actions to solve this, the severity of this problem still persist, which means we have to improve the effectiveness of solving this problem. In this journal, we propose an application to integrate the data about stunting cases in Indonesia with its causes details, in hope to increase the effectiveness of government interventions in solving this problem. The application we propose implements interactive multimedia method to increase simplicity, user engagement, intuitiveness, and availability in processing data on stunting case. © 2019 The Authors.

The analysis showed that the diphtheria immunization coverage and the number of community health centers are the factors that most affect the number of cases of diphtheria.

Although Indonesia has succeeded in reducing malnutrition and stunting rates over the past few years, these two issues must still be considered as something serious in order to prevent the increasing number of malnutrition and stunting rates in the future. This study aims to analyze the suitable logistic regression methods and growth charts to reduce the number of children with malnutrition and stunting status. Based on the analysis of previous studies and theories, researchers have found that multinomial logistic regression is the most suitable method to measure children nutritional and stunting status because it can provide more specific results, such as malnutrition, undernutrition, normal nutrition and obese. WHO growth charts - weight-for-age chart that already exists in Kartu Menuju Sehat (KMS) - is suitable to be applied in monitoring child's nutritional status because Indonesia's Anthropometric Standards Assessing Nutritional Status of Children are developed based on WHO Standards. To be able to perform Indonesian children stunting status measurement, WHO length-for-age or height-for-age growth chart needs to be applied. © 2017 The Authors.

This method has been used in various fields including in the health field. In this research, ordinal logistic regression is used to describe the relationship between nutritional status of children with age, gender, height, and family status. Nutritional status of children in this research is divided into over nutrition, well nutrition, less nutrition, and malnutrition. The purpose for this research is to describe the characteristics of children in the KarangKitri Village and to determine the factors that influence the nutritional status of children in the KarangKitri village. There are three things that obtained from this research. First, there are still children who are not categorized as well nutritional status. Second, there are children who come from sufficient economic level which include in not normal status. Third, the factors that affect the nutritional level of children are age, family status, and height. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.","logistic regression; nutritional status of children; odds ratio; ordinal logistic regression; probability",,,,,,"Agresti, A., (2007) An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis, pp. 280-282. , New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons; Das, S., Rahman, R.M., (2011) Nutrition Journal, 1-12; Kleinbaum, D.G., Klein, M., (2010) Logistic Regression, pp. 466-481. , London: Springer; Norris, C.M., Ghali, W.A., Saunders, D., Brant, R., Galbraith, D., Faris, P., Knudtson, M.L., (2006) Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, 59, pp. 448-456; O'Connel, A.A., (2006) Logistic Regression Models for Ordinal Response Variable, pp. 27-30. , California: Sage; Yongharto, K.O., Suroso, J., Ohyver, M., (2012) Opportunity Analysis of Nutritional Status for Children Using Multinomial Logistic Regression Based on Computer, , Undergraduate, Thesis, Bina Nusantara University",,"Purqon A.Hwu R.J.-R.Hidayat T.Arimura H.","","American Institute of Physics Inc.","5th International Conference on Mathematics and Natural Sciences, ICMNS 2014","2 November 2014 through 3 November 2014",,115934,0094243X,9780735413245,,,"English","AIP Conf.

This research reports and presents obstacles avoidance method for intelligent telepresence robot, a custom-build robot system specifically designed for teleconference with multiple people. We propose an interval type-2 FLC (Fuzzy Logic Controller) that is able to handle uncertainties for measuring distance of obstacle to navigate the robot. The robot is controlled using computer networks, so the manager/supervisor at office/industry can direct the robot to the intended person to start a discussion/inspection. We build a web application for controlling the multi-client telepresence robot and open-source video conference system. Experimental result shows the ability of robot to be controlled remotely and to avoid obstacles smoothly and we evaluated its performance. © 2014 ICIC International.","Interval type-2 FLC; Obstacle avoidance; Telepresence robot","Interval Type-2 FLC; Measuring distances; Multiple people; Obstacles avoidance; Research reports; Telepresence robots; Video conference systems; WEB application; Collision avoidance; Fuzzy logic; Visual communication; Intelligent robots",,,,,"Budiharto, W., Purwanto, D., Jazidie, A., A navigation system for service robot using stereo vision and Kalman filtering (2011) Proc. of the 11th IEEE International Conference On Control, Automation and Systems, pp. 1771-1776; Escolano, C., A telepresence mobile robot controlled with a noninvasive brain-computer interface (2012) IEEE Transactions On Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, 42 (3), pp. 793-804; Lazewatsky, D.A., Smart, W.D., An inexpensive robot platform for teleoperation and experimentation (2011) Proc. of the IEEE International Conference On Robotics and Automation, pp. 1211-1216. , Shanghai; Hagras, H., A type-2 fuzzy logic controller for autonomous mobile robots (2004) Proc. of the 2004 IEEE International Conference On Fuzzy Systems, , FUZZ-IEEE, Budapest, Hungary; Hagras, H., Type-2 FLCs: A new generation of fuzzy controllers (2007) IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, pp. 30-43; Mendel, J., Advances in type-2 fuzzy sets and systems (2007) Information Sciences, pp. 84-110; Mendel, J.M., (2001) Uncertain Rule-Based Fuzzy Logic Systems: Introduction and New Directions, , Upper Saddle River, Prentice-Hall, NJ; Takayama, L., Marder-Eppstein, E., Harris, H., Beer, J.M., Assisted driving of a mobile remote presence system: System design and controlled user evaluation (2011) Proc. of the IEEE International Conference On Robotics and Automation, pp. 1883-1889. , Shanghai; Wang, L.X., (1997) A Course In Fuzzy Systems and Control, , Prentice Hall, New Jersey; Quigley, M., Gerkey, B., Conley, K., Faust, J., Foote, T., ROS: An open-source robot operating system (2009) Proc. of the Open-Source Software Workshop At the International Conference On Robotics and Automation, p. 6; Castilo, O., (2012) Type-2 Fuzzy Logic: Theory and Applications, , Studies in Fuzziness and Soft Computing), Springer Publisher; Alers, S., Bloembergen, D., Hennes, D., Tuyls, K., Augmented mobile telepresence with assisted control (2011) Proc. of the 23rd Benelux Conference On Artificial Intelligence; Sheridan, T.B., (1992) Telerobotics, Automation and Human Supervisory Control, , 1st Edition, MIT Press; Budiharto, W., Kanigoro, B., Shodiq, M., Hutomo, The framework of intelligent telepresence robot based on stereo vision (2012) Journal of Computer Science, 8 (12); Budiharto, W., Santoso, D., Jazidie, A., A robust obstacle avoidance for service robot using Bayesian approach (2011) International Journal Advanced Robotic System, 8, pp. 37-44; http://www.webrtc.org/; http://www.nexusrobot.com/product.php?id product=21","School of Computer Science, Jl.

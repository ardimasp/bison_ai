In the fine-tuning step, Delta rule is used to update the coordinates of reference points based on the wireless environment represented in the training dataset. The combination of the coarse estimation and the proposed fine-tuning makes the coarse-to-fine algorithm. The algorithms used for coarse estimation are weighted sum and k-nearest neighbour, with three weight calculation algorithms that are compared in this experiment: Minkowski distance, k-means Gaussian mixture model, and autoencoder. Two subject rooms are used in order to measure the performance of the algorithms. The experiment showed that the fine-tuning algorithm improves the accuracy of the positioning throughout all combination of methods in both rooms, which shows its versatility. It reduces the mean positioning error by up to 11.3% and depends on what algorithm used in the weight calculation. Another benefit from the fine-tuning model is that it does not increase the complexity of the algorithm in the online phase. Overall, the best result is achieved by the combination of weighted sum and k-nearest neighbour with Minkowski distance weight calculation, together with the proposed fine-tuning. Its mean positioning error is 0.8740 m for Room 1 and 1.5385 for Room 2. The average computing time for a single online query is 0.4 ms for Room 1 and 0.7 ms for Room 2. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Bluetooth Low Energy; Coarse-to-fine estimation; Fingerprinting; Indoor positioning system","Bluetooth; Gaussian distribution; Indoor positioning systems; K-means clustering; Nearest neighbor search; Bluetooth low energies (BTLE); Gaussian Mixture Model; K-nearest neighbours; Minkowski distance; Positioning error; Reference points; Weight calculation; Wireless environment; Computational complexity",,,,,,"Anahid, B., Elena Simona, L., Terry, M., Adam, W., Pekka, P., Chris, H., Pouria, A., Pedro, S., Indoor location based services challenges, requirements and usability of current solutions (2017) Comput Sci Rev, 24, pp. 1-12; Li, K., Du, T.C., Building a targeted mobile advertising system for location-based services (2012) Decis Support Syst, 54 (1), pp. 1-8; Maghdid, H., Lami, I., Ghafoor, K., Lloret, J., Seamless outdoors-indoors localization solutions on smartphones: implementation and challenges (2016) ACM Comput Surv, 48 (4), pp. 1-34; Medina, C., Segura, J.C., Torre, Á., Ultrasound indoor positioning system based on a low-power wireless sensor network providing sub-centimeter accuracy (2013) Sensors, 13 (3), pp. 3501-3526; Lee, C., Indoor positioning system based on incident angles of infrared emitters (2004) 30Th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, 2004.

Researchers have worked out many different transmitters as well as several positioning algorithms to improve the IPS. In 2012, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) was started to become publicly available and become one of the potential transmitters in IPS. Since then, researchers have proposed many positioning methods specifically for BLE. However, there has been no recent review on IPS techniques using BLE. Therefore, this review was made in order to serve a comprehensive understanding of the different positioning methods, by focusing on BLE. Based on the literature study, four future research directions on IPS using BLE are also provided in this review. © 2019 ICIC International","Bluetooth low energy; Fingerprint-based algorithm; Indoor location-based service; Indoor positioning system; Positioning techniques",,,,,"Binus University: 033/VR","Acknowledgement.

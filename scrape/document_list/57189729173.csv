It concerned to the nutritional needs of calories, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates as well as the purchase cost for the hospital management. Using the Criss-Cross method, the output of the model was obtained to help determine the number of each food to be compiled into an optimal diet for stroke patients.©2013 Ngarap Im.","Criss-cross; Optimization; Stroke patients",,,,,,"Callahan, E., Microsoft Access 2000 Visual Basic for Applications Fundamentals (2001), Jakarta: Elex Media Komputindo; Hillier, F.S., Lieberman, G.J., (2005) Introduction to Operation Research, , 8 ed.

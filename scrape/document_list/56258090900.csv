However, there are less understandings on factors influencing the uses. Looking at existing literature, the uses of social media within a government are focused on transparency, openness, collaboration, and citizen participation. Hence, this study aims at investigating factors influencing the uses. Four theories being considered intentionally follow prior researches (i.e., transparency, openness, participation, and collaboration). Particularly, this study attempts to examine factors influencing people behavior within a government in using social media to accomplish their activities in various aspects, including politics, economics, social, culture, defense, and security. Besides, the uses are observed in several governmental tasks such as dealing with complaints, reports and documentation, critics and suggestions, and information dissemination to citizens. Therefore, this study will deliver a new understanding to the government on factors influencing their uses of social media, including how they might use social media accordingly to the needs of their citizens. © 2020 IEEE.","Citizen interaction; Collaboration; Government; Information; Openness; Participation; Social media; Transparency","Behavioral research; Economics; Information dissemination; Information management; Transparency; Citizen participation; People behavior; Social media; Systematic literature review; Social networking (online)",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

Such an idea did not fulfill the government's expectations, because it failed to involve the wider community. Key factors that can explain and predict citizen participation have not been thoroughly identified. The purpose of this research is to identify relevant factors that can influence the intention of citizens to engage in e-Participation through social media initiatives. The research involved 349 end-users of social media-based e-government applications in Tangerang, Indonesia (Laksa application) which carried out to develop a model aimed at explaining and predicting citizens' behavioral intentions on their involvement in government e-Participation initiatives through social media. The methodological approach is based on the utilization and expansion of one of the well-known theories to describe someone‟s acceptance behavior, namely Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The proposed model also draws from several best practices related to technology diffusions such as TRI, TAM, UTAUT, IS / IT Success Models, and other factors that influence the application of social media-based e-Government such as navigation, accessibility, security, design and innovativeness based on previous research. The proposed model can bring a better understanding of important issues especially in the process of adopting social media-based e-Government. This paper contributes in understanding the reasons why people decide to be involved or not in the e-Participation initiatives that initiated by the government through social media. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Citizen; E-government; Social media","e-government; E-learning; Social networking (online); Behavioral intention; Citizen; Citizen participation; E-Government applications; Methodological approach; Social media; Technology diffusion; Theory of Planned Behavior; Economic and social effects",,,,"Binus University: 12/AKM/PNT/2019","This work is supported by Directorate General of Research and Development Strengthening, Indonesian Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University titled “Pengembangan Aplikasi e-Government Berbasis Media Sosial di Indonesia” or “Social Media Based Government Application Development in Indonesia” with contract number: 12/AKM/PNT/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","Centeno, C., van Bavel, R., Burgelman, J.C., A prospective view of e-government in the European union (2005) The Electronic Journal of E-Government, 3 (2), pp. 59-66; Pereira, G.V., Macadar, M.A., Luciano, E.M., Testa, M.G., Delivering public value through open government data initiatives in a Smart City context (2016) Information Systems Frontiers, , http://doi.org/10.1007/s10796-016-9673-7; Macintosh, A., Coleman, S., Schneeberger, A., Eparticipation: The research gaps (2009) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 5694, pp. 1-11; Medaglia, R., EParticipation research: Moving characterization forward (2006-2011) (2012) Government Information Quarterly, 29 (3), pp. 346-360; Sæbø, Ø., Rose, J., Flak, L., The shape of eParticipation: Characterizing an emerging research area (2008) Government Information Quarterly, 25 (3), pp. 400-428; Susha, I., Grönlund, T., Context clues for the stall of the Citizens‟ Initiative: Lessons for opening up e-participation development practice (2014) Government Information Quarterly, 31 (3), pp. 454-465; Charalabidis, Y., Loukis, E., Androutsopoulou, A., Karkaletsis, V., Triantafillou, A.

One of the main issues faced by those tourists is that they can not make simple queries to search engines about, for example, which sites or places to visit optimally if we only have one day or two-day visit? Search engines are better and better in replying users' queries with relevant answers. However, search engines are not always able to respond queries suited to users' characteristics such as their styles, personalities, knowledge backgrounds, etc. Also, search engines are not as flexible as chatbots in enabling dialogical-communication-queries. This case study aims to respond aformentioned issue by applying hierarchical cluster analysis on a set of tourism sites around Malang city, Malang regency, and Batu city based on AGNES (Agglomerative Nesting) algorithm. The result, then, is fed into chatbot's knowledge base. This chatbot will assist tourists to get information on which possible sites they have to visit optimally if they are under limited vacancy-Time constraints. © 2018 IEEE.","AGNES algorithm; chatbot; tourism sites","Cluster analysis; Hierarchical systems; Information management; Knowledge based systems; Search engines; Chatbot; Chatbots; Hierarchical cluster analysis; Knowledge base; Time constraints; tourism sites; Clustering algorithms",,,,,,"Brooke, S., A travel industry revolution: The chatbots (2017) Chatbots Journal, , https://chatbotsjournal.com/a-Travelindustry-revolution-The-chatbots-1a2468baf78c, [Accessed: 30-Mar-2018]; Han, J., Kamber, M., Pei, J., (2012) Data Mining-Concepts and Techniques 3ed-Jiawei Han, Micheline Kamber Elsevier 2006 772s; Zhao, Y., Karypis, G., Evaluation of hierarchical clustering algorithms for document datasets (2002) Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management-CIKM 02, p. 515; Davidson, I., Ravi, S.S., Agglomerative hierarchical clustering with constraints: Theory and empirical resutls (2005) 9th Eur.

Data were collected from samples representing Indonesia, covering deaths throughout 2016, and at all deaths were verbal autopsies, according to World Health Organization guidelines in real time by doctors and trained personnel. From the data, it is seen that 10 types of diseases are the most common cause of death in Indonesia including cancer, cerebrovascular, and ischemic heart. But the information of 10 types of disease is still not common to the people of Indonesia. This research describes the design of a mobile application called 'I'm CARE'. The application is based on the 10 most dangerous diseases in Indonesia, as reported by the health information media. The research method used is data collection method that includes interviews with several specialist doctors. It also uses the method of analysis and database design that includes the design of the conceptual database, logical, and physical. Then using manual interaction computer to design user interface on mobile application and some machine learning models such as Decision Tree, k = Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The results achieved are the design of mobile-based application 'I'm CARE' model as a health information media about 10 diseases dangerous in Indonesia and prediction model of heart. The conclusion is that with the design of 'I'm CARE' mobile-based application model as health information media about 10 diseases dangerous disease in Indonesia and prediction model of heart hence dissemination of health information to Indonesian society can be improved and assist government in health area. © 2017 IEEE.","Health; Heart; I'm CARE; Mobile","Decision trees; Health; Heart; Information management; mHealth; Mobile computing; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Support vector machines; User interfaces; Application modeling; Data collection method; Health informations; Machine learning models; Mobile; Mobile applications; Mobile health application; World Health Organization; Information dissemination",,,,,,"Statistik, B.P., (2014) Persentase Penduduk Daerah Perkotaan Menurut Provinsi, 2010-2035, , https://www.bps.go.id/linkTabelStatis/view/id/1276, [Online]; Utarini, A., Djasri, H., Keselamatan Pasien dan Mutu Pelayan Kesehatan: Menuju Kemana?

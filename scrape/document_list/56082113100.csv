As a matter of fact, the use of information technology and information system for medical purpose is continuously growing. This phenomenon is widely known as telemedicine. Indonesia as the largest country in South East Asia has been facing healthcare as its key problem. The equal distribution of healthcare is difficult to achieve due to the geographical condition. Therefore, the need to implement knowledge management (KM) for telemedicine in Indonesia will help Indonesian society obtain medical knowledge simultaneously. The KM model for Telemedicine in Indonesia was derived from SECI model by Nonaka and Takeuchi. The conversion of 2(two) types of knowledge (tacit and explicit knowledge) were becoming the focus point. The research methodology used literature review and forum group discussion (FGD) with medical practitioners. Expectantly, most features created from this model, will become propose features for KM portal for telemedicine in Indonesia. © 2017 IEEE.","Knowledge Conversion; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Management Model; SECI Model; Spiral Model; Telemedicine","Health care; Information use; Knowledge management; Telemedicine; Geographical conditions; Knowledge conversion; Knowledge management model; Medical practitioner; Research methodologies; SECI model; Spiral models; Tacit and explicit knowledge; Medical information systems",,,,,"(2014) Kompas.com, , http://health.kompas.com/read/2014/03/12/0924352/Hadapi.Era.Telemedicine.Siapkah, Unoviana Kartika, Maret, [Online]; Suharto, H., (2015) Infoasia.id, , http://www.infoasia.id/berita-telemedis-diagnosa-pasien-jarakjauh.html, Desember, [Online]; Hatem, B., Nick Hajili, M., Xiaolin, L., Mauricio, F., Ivan, C., Social media for developing health services (2013) Qualitative Market Research: An International Journa, 17 (3), pp. 283-296; (2013) News.detik.com, , http://news.detik.com/berita/2360584/siasati-penanganan-cepatpasien-haji-bphi-makkah-ujicoba-telemedicine/2, DetikNews, September, [Online]; (2015) Newsroom.gehealthcare.com, , http://newsroom.gehealthcare.com/getting-puskesmas-online-the-next-frontier-forindonesian-healthcare/, Newsroom.gehealthcare.com, Agustus, [Online]; Elfita, R., (2016), http://lifestyle.bisnis.com/, Oktober, HYPERLINK http://lifestyle.bisnis.com/read/20160628/106/562026/telemedicinesolusi-untuk-peningkatan-pelayanan-kesehatan-di-daerah-terpencil"" http://lifestyle.bisnis.com/read/20160628/106/562026/telemedicinesolusi-untuk-peningkatan-pelayanan-kesehatan-di-daerah-terpencil; Laudon, K.C., Laudon, J.P., (2016) Management Information Systems: Managing the Digital Firm, , Pearson; Wickramasinghe, N., Healthcare knowledge management: Incorporating the tools, technologies, strategies, and process of knowledge management to effect superior healthcare delivery (2007) Healthcare Knowledge Management: Issues, Advances, Sucesses, pp. 21-38. , Springer; Alsanad, A., Zemirli, N., A guideline for using knowledge management in telemedicine systems dedicated for diabetes patients in Saudi Arabia (2015) New Contributions in Information Systems and Technologies: Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 1, pp. 193-201. , Springer; DelliFraine, J.L., Dansky, K.H., Rumberger, J., The use of knowledge management in telemedicine (2009) International Journal of Healthcare Management and Technology, 10 (3), pp. 209-222; Lamont, J., (2014) KMworld.com, , http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/Editorial/Features/Healthcareanatomy-of-telemedicine-systems-101144.aspx, Desember, [Online], HYPERLINK http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/Editorial/Features/Healthcare-anatomy-of-telemedicine-systems-101144.aspx; Fong, B., Fong, A.C.M., Li, C.K., (2011) Telemedicine Technologies: Information Technologies in Medicine and Telehealth, , John Wiley & Sons; Jawad, M., Abass, J., Hariri, A., Akl, E.A., Social media use for public health campaigning in a low resource setting: The case of waterpipe tobacco smoking (2015) BioMed Research International; Aitken, M., Engaging patients through social media: Is healthcare ready for empowered and digitally demanding patients?

The conception of the Green BSC was derived from Green IT Governance model for private higher education institution that already constructed from the prior research. The balanced score in the balanced scorecard provides a measurement for particular objectives set by the organization. However, in Green BSC, list of objectives were given to standardize the measurement for each private higher education institution. Institutions can calculate the balance score by themselves and implement the initiatives provide. Yet, further research may be applied to validate the propose model. © 2016 IEEE.","BSC; Green Balanced Scorecard; Green BSC; Green IT; Higher Education","Green computing; Information management; Records management; Balanced scorecards; Green BSC; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Education",,,,,"Putri, H.A.N.K.S., Muljoredjo, H., The use of green information technology governance model to determine capability maturity level in dki Jakarta (2014) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 61 (1), pp. 10-16; Kaplan, R.S., Conceptual foundations of the balanced scorecard (2010) Harvard Business School Working Paper; Kaplan, R.S., Norton, D.P., Using the balanced scorecard as a strategic management system (1996) Harvard Business Review, , January-February; Sim, K.L., Koh, H.C., Balanced scorecard: A rising trend in strategic performance measurement (2001) Measuring Business Excellence, 5 (2), pp. 18-26; Jain, H., Green ICT Organizational implementations and workplace relationships (2011) Handbook of Research on Green ICT: Technology, Business and Social Perspectives, Hershey, IGI Global, pp. 156-168; Punniyamoorthy, M., Murali, R., Balanced score for the balanced scorecard: A benchmarking tool (2008) Benchmarking: An International Journal, 15 (4), pp. 420-443; Lee, S.M., Park, S.-H., Trimi, S., Greening with IT: Practices of leading countries and strategies of followers (2013) Management Decision, 51 (3), pp. 629-642; Kosik, W.J., Energy and sustainability in data centers (2015) Data Center Handbook, pp. 15-45. , New Jersey, John Wiley & Sons; Unhelkar, B., Enterprise Green IT Strategy (2012) Harnessing Green IT: Principles and Practices, West Sussex, pp. 149-165. , John Wiley & Sons Ltd; Curry, E., Donellan, B., Sustainable nformation Systems and Green Metrics (2012) Harnessing Green IT: Principles and Practices, West Sussex, pp. 167-198. , John Wiley & Sons Ltd; Sheridan, C.G., Ellis, K.A., Castro-Leon, E.G., Fowler, C.P., Green data centres (2012) Harnessing Green IT: Principle and Practices, West Sussex, pp. 85-111. , John Wiley & Sons Ltd; (2016) Link PTS, , http//kopertis3.or.id/v2/link-pts/, Kopertis 3; Van Grembergen, W., The balanced scorecard and it governance (2000) Information Systems Control Journal, 2; Keyes, J., (2005) Implementing the IT Balanced Scorecard, , FL: Taylor & Francis Group; Davidson, R., Tse, D., Martisons, M., The balanced scorecard: A foundation for the strategic management of information systems (1999) Journal Decision Support System, 25 (1), pp. 71-88; Van Grembergen, W., Saull, R., De Haes, S., Linking the IT balanced scorecard to the business objectives at a major canadian financial group (2003) Journal of Information Technology Cases and Application, 5 (1)",,,"BINUS Univerity;IEEE Indonesia Section;Wiley","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2016","16 November 2016 through 18 November 2016",,127842,,9781509033522,,,"English","Proc.

Meanwhile, DKI Jakarta as the capital city of Indonesia has a total of 325 private higher education institutions. Green IT term is quiet well known in these areas, although its implementation is still sporadic. However, information technology (IT) gives fully support toward the learning process at the campus area. As its project scope, this research was focused in DKI Jakarta, but it is applicable for others. Many research on green IT or green computing have been conducted, however none of them focusing on Private Higher Education Institutions in Indonesia. Based on the previous research done by various Private Higher Education Institutions,IBM and Green Computing Methodology by GTYS, the Green IT Governance Model for Private Higher Education Institutions in DKI Jakarta area was developed. However, further researches are expected in order to develop the best practice. Furthermore, energy saving, waste management systems and information technology will be controlled accordingly and the threat of toxins that can harm our health can be avoided. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

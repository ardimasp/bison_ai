When this research was written, there were 1,780,315 positive cases globally. Countries in the world take various actions to curb the spread of this new virus. China is taking strict lockdown steps, while other countries such as South Korea are using massive diagnoses. While it might only be acceptable for countries with not too big populations, what the South Korean Government is doing is very interesting to research so that it can be recognized by other countries. This study use data mining techniques to search for pattern or new information from the data of the Covid-19 patients in South Korea. This study studies the use of decision trees to process the data in South Korea by finding the most optimal decision tree criteria. This study contributes to the data mining related field by showing decision tree is good enough to analyze the data. There are three best criteria for using a decision tree to predict deaths from this new virus. The best decision tree metrics are the gain ratio, knowledge gain and the gini index. In this analysis the gain-ratio is use for further analysis. Another finding is the province or location of this virus is the important factor. The implication of this finding supports the strategy of reducing virus transmission. Sex and age also play an important role in the prediction model. © 2020 Little Lion Scientific.

Chinese overseas have strong emotional ties with the State of China as their country of origin. In Indonesia, Chinese overseas are called Tionghoa ethnic. They have been living in Indonesia for many generations and believed that they came to Indonesia long before the century. This research was to examine Chinese ethnic perspectives on Confucius values of their leadership in West Java Chinese organization (Fuqing association). This research was conducted at Fuqing association in West Java covering four cities namely Bandung, Bogor, Cianjur, and Sukabumi. The questionnaire was distributed to 121 active members of the Fuqing association. The questionnaire consisted of 31 questions that represent Confucius values. This study used confirmatory factor analysis to test the research model using Smart Partial Least Square version 3.0 (Smart PLS 3.0). The results of this research showed that Confucius values were still practised in Chinese leadership in West Java. Generally, Confucius values in Chinese ethnic leadership are still similar to confusion leadership variables, but the significant variable in Chinese leadership is different. In West Java, the important variables are moral character and lifelong learning. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Chinese ethnic perspective; Chinese leadership; Confucius values; Leadership",,,,,,"Praise the Lord for everything.

With the various advantages of advertising on social media, making it very suitable for MSMEs. The use of video as a format for delivering advertising messages is also rife because of the faster internet speed. However, the cost of making ads in the form of videos is relatively more expensive so it needs a lot of consideration when making it be efficient. One thing that advertisers often pay attention to on social media is the click-through rate. This variable becomes one of the measures of the effectiveness of an advertisement. Hence predicting click-through rate is become important nowadays for advertisers, especially to those who have budget constraints. This research tries to predict the click-through rate using data mining techniques. This paper use CRISP method. The dataset was taken from a Facebook advertisement from a small-medium enterprise in Indonesia. Video watches at 25%, 50%, 75%,95% and 100% is use as predictors. The results show that data mining can be used to predict the click-through rate using video watches percentage. Deep learning is the most suitable model for this prediction. The interpretation of the results from data mining is done and managed to find the variables that support the predictions and contradict the predictions. © BEIESP.","Advertising; Click-through rate; Data mining; Deep learning; Social media",,,,,,,"Statista, , https://www.statista.com/statistics/284437/indonesia-social-network-penetration/; https://www.statista.com/statistics/268136/top-15-countries-based-on-number-of-facebook-users/, Statista.

The paper will improve the existing organic food product distribution business model and the proposed business model with the implementation of knowledge management to accommodate the value co-creation among stakeholders. The reason why value co-creation among stakeholders needs to be improved is because currently organic food producers focus only on selling their products without having proper knowledge about their customers, while customers do not have enough awareness about organic food’s benefit. Because of this gap, this research tries to find the solution by improving the organic product distribution system through the application of value co-creation process.

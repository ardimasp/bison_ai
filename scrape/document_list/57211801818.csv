Besides delivering the right news to public, they also have to deliver fast. Therefore getting the potential news fast is one important key for journalist.. This study tries to use the information public from social media tweeter. Social media is considered as public information which every people can be involved. This system, starts collecting tweets which mention formal tweeter media. The application will group each tweets into various themes based on the cosine similarity. If cosine similarity is big, it can be indicated as one group news.. The tweets which are more than the certain threshold, it can be indicated as the candidate news. This candidate news is then classified into one of ten categories using support vector machine (SVM). This classification has 85% accuracy. The category classified is used for assigning the specific journalist to cover this candidate news. This system has two important modules. One in center server which is responsible for collecting and processing data, the other one application mobile which is installed in journalist is called Journes. The results show the Journes give notification to journalist for getting some candidate news. © BEIESP.","Candidate news; Classification; Journalist; Tweeter",,,,,"23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019","This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia, as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University titled “Sistem Penugasan Jurnalis Berdasarkan Trafik Media Sosial” or “Journalist Assignment System Based on Social Media Traffic” with contract number: 23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","Budiyono, M., Media Sosial Dan Komunikasi Politik: Media Sosial Sebagai Komunikasi Politik Menjelang Pilkada Dki Jakarta 2017 (2017) Jurnal Komunikasi, 11 (1), pp. 47-62. , https://doi.org/10.20885/komunikasi.vol11.iss1.art4; Nugraha, R.P., Pengaruh New Media Terhadap Perkembangan Cyber Society (2013) Prosiding Seminar Besar Nasional Dan Kongres ISKI VI Padang, pp. 681-686; Pengaruh Aktivitas di Media Sosial Terhadap Rutinitas Blogger Sumatera Barat The Influence of Activity in Social Media Toward Writing Habit to Sumatera Barat Bloggers.

GIS Bookstore is one company that needs data every month to be analyzed. However, GIS Bookstore has constraints in processing large data with increasing time. for example GIS bookstore has problems in analyzing bestsellers because of the increasing number of authors and book publishers who work together. In this study, GIS Bookstore found a solution by implementing business intelligence that plays a role in the processing of raw data in large amounts of data into well-structured data information, the results are collected and processed in a data warehouse scheme. Targets stored in the data warehouse are data that will be processed based on the model design method (ERD) and star schema. This paper discusses the GIS Bookstore data warehouse with the aim of analyzing the sales of most books based on a certain time period. The method used in retrieving data uses Pentaho data integration tools, MySQL workbench, report designer, bi server and workbench schema. © 2019 IEEE.","architecture; business intelligence; data warehouse; design","Architecture; Competitive intelligence; Data warehouses; Design; Information analysis; Integration tools; Large amounts of data; Large data; Model design; Star schema; Structured data; Surrounding environment; Time-periods; Data integration",,,,,,"Asrani, D., Jain, R., Designing a framework to standardize data warehouse development process for effective data warehousing practices (2016) International Journal of Database Management Systems, 8 (4), pp. 15-32. , http://doi.org/10.5121/ijdms.2016.8402; North, M., Thomas, L., Richardson, R., Akpess, P., Data warehousing a practical managerial approach (2017) Computer Science and Information Technology, 5 (1), pp. 18-26. , http://doi.org/10.13189/csit.2017.050103; Wang, J., Kourik, J.L., Data warehouse snowflake design and performance considerations in business analytics (2015) Journal of Advances in Information Technology, 6 (4), pp. 212-216. , http://doi.org/10.12720/jait.6.4.212-216; White, M., (2018) Big Data Vs.

Physical security could be improved through the implementation of indoor positioning with a real-time monitoring system. Other than security needs, the information provided could be used for emergency evacuation purposes in a disastrous situation. Presently, indoor positioning is principally based on wireless signals, such as WiFi, RFID, Zigbee, Bluetooth, etc. This study designs a user access management system in the Data Center using indoor-positioning. For the indoor positioning method, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbor (FkNN) algorithms and Kalman Filter implementation are evaluated. The simulation result shows that the proposed method can improve the positioning accuracy until 8% compared to the existing method. © 2019 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.","Bluetooth Low Energy; Fuzzy kNN; Indoor Positioning; Kalman Filter; RSSI",,,,,,,"Salas, A.C., (2014) Indoor Positioning System Based on Bluetooth Low Energy, , Degree's Thesis Submitted to the Faculty of the Escola Tècnica d'Enginyeria de Telecomunicació de Barcelona Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Barcelona; Kriz, P., Maly, F., Kozel, T., Improving Indoor Localization Using Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons (2016) Mobile Information Systems, pp. 1-11. , http://dx.doi.org/DOI:10.1155/2016/2083094; Sukhov, R.R., Amzakarov, M.B., Isaev, E.A., Advanced Data Center Economy (2013) Business Informatic, 2 (24), pp. 13-18; Dumsky, D.V., Isaev, E.A., Data centers for physical research (2015) Physics Procedia, 71, pp. 298-302. , http://dx.doi.org/DOI:10.1016/j.phpro.2015.08.330, Elsevier B.V; Lin, X.Y., Ho, T.W., Fang, C.C., Yen, Z.S., Yang, B.J., Lai, F., A mobile indoor positioning system based on iBeacon technology (2015) Proceedings of the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, 2015, pp. 4970-4973. , https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319507, EMBS, Milan; Van, H.T., Poorter, E.D., Crombez, P., Lemic, F., Handziski, V., Wirström, N., Wolisz, A., Moerman, I., Performance analysis of multiple Indoor Positioning Systems in a healthcare environment (2016) International Journal of Health Geographics, 15 (7), pp. 1-15. , https://doi.org/10.1186/s12942doi.org/10.1186/s12942-016-0034-z; Soewito, B., Wiguna, A., Suharjito, S., Diana, D., Bluetooth Low Energy: Comparing 4 Trilateration Models in Indoor Positioning System (2018) International Journal on Communications Antenna and Propagation (IRECAP), 8 (6), pp. 500-509. , https://doi.org/10.15866/irecap.v8i6.13476; Yang, Z., Liu, Y., Quality of Trilateration: Confidence-Based Iterative Localization (2010) IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 21 (5), pp. 631-640. , May; Zhuang, Y., Yang, J., Li, Y., Qi, L., El-Sheimy, N., Smartphone-based indoor localization with bluetooth low energy beacons (2016) Sensors (Switzerland), 16 (5), pp. 1-20. , https://doi.org/10.3390/s16050596; Hansen, R., Thomsen, B., Thomsen, L.L., Adamsen, F.S., SmartCampusAAU-an open platform enabling indoor positioning and navigation (2013) Proceedings of 14Th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management, 2, pp. 33-38; Karlsson, F., Karlsson, M., Bernhardsson, B., Tufvesson, F., Persson, M., Sensor fused indoor positioning using dual-band WiFi signal measurements (2015) Proceedings of European Control Conference (ECC), Linz, pp. 1669-1672; Zafari, F., Papapanagiotou, I., Enhancing iBeacon Based Micro-Location with Particle Filtering (2015) Proceedings of IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 1, pp. 1-7. , San Diego, CA; Deepesh, P.C., Akshay Tiwary, R.R., Vikram, N., Rao, and N.

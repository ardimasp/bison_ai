This research explained the knowledge management model focus on how to manage tacit and explicit knowledge of medical personnel in hospital at Indonesia, because the main problem is how the senior medical personnel transfer the knowledge to explicit form or vice versa. The research used descriptive statistic to analysis from thirty-Three hospitals knowledge mode or conversion from tacit-explicit or explicit-Tacit.

To ensure the implementation of information systems in line with institutional objectives, the information system must be managed properly by implementing IT Governance. Educational institutions also have an interest in this matter. To be able to compete with other educational institutions and ensure the quality of the three pillars of education (teaching, research, and community service) can run well, IT management in educational institutions must use the principles of IT Governance. The extent to which universities in Indonesia have implemented IT governance will be discussed in this article. Using a systematic literature review method, the author will discuss how the level of maturity of IT Governance from six universities in Indonesia.

The use of the flipped classroom has been running in this department for four semesters, where in one semester, each class gets a subject that is taught by a flipped classroom method. Questionnaires were distributed online among students from level one to three in October 2018 and 249 respondents were obtained. The data obtained were analyzed using descriptive statistics in order to study the perception of the students about the application of the flipped classroom, both in general and from the four aspects of the engagement: behavioral, emotional, cognitive and agentic engagement. The results obtained show that most of the respondents (61%) agreed with the use of flipped classroom because the class became more fun. In terms of engagement, behavioral engagement has the highest mean value of 3.12 while agent engagement has the lowest mean value of 2.42. It means that students have shown an attitude to follow the flipped classroom method but have not actively participated. The rest where students disagreed with flipped classroom is due to lecturers assumed unprepared and/or students have difficulty learning by themselves. © IAEME Publication.","Aspects; Engagement; Evaluation; Flipped Learning; Perception",,,,,,,"Chicca, J., Shellenbarger, T., Connecting with generation Z: Approaches in nursing education (2018) Teach.

Moreover, the data are not available on time that's make monitoring process becomes hampered so that the impact on the result of the student's performance. Therefore, this system is also to make it easier for users of the system to be able to view the performance of students in accordance with the data that is needed in the process of monitoring. The development of the systems is using System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) method, starting from the planning phase to planning the development of the system, then perform the analysis on the process of monitoring that is currently running and analyze the data related to the process of monitoring, then entered the stage of design to design the system that will be built into diagrams, then the last stage is the building of the monitoring system success students study based on web platform. In the student performance monitoring system there will be a data of students who have not yet reached minimum indicators, students who achieve minimum indicators and students who have passed the minimum limit indicator. From the data, users can also view every detail of each indicator.

Then analyze business processes and problems, as well as the user requirements using difference table analysis. From the analysis, the consultant identified the problems that exist. After getting the requirement, conducted stages of planning new business processes or Blueprint. The Blueprint contains the system running now (as-is) and the design of the system that will be applied (to-be) which will be used in the realization stage to perform configuration, customization, data migration and testing interfaces. The next stage is the final preparation, where consultants will conduct final testing, create a user manual and conduct user training.

Business process simulation applications has two major subsystems, namely wholesale and retail sales. The business activities that will be developed in the business process simulation system are the incoming inquiries, sales orders, delivery and billing. In addition there is also a part of the procurement cycle such as purchase orders. With this software, the students will be able directly interact with the simulation systems and business process practice has been applied to the industry. In this application there are some additional features that support simulation analysis, such as wholesale analysis and billing list generation process. And there are also features related reporting process such as purchase order reports, reports of wholesale and retail sales orders, profits and loss, cash flow, balance sheet and capital reports. We hope through research and development of this system, the students will get an overview of the actual business process-related business processes of sales, distribution, and business workflow in the company. By creating a business process simulation applications, we hope this application can help students to learn the business processes of sales and distribution processes more effectively.","Business process; Information systems; Learning activities; Simulation; Systems design","Computer software; File organization; Information systems; Purchasing; Students; Systems analysis; Business activities; Business Process; Business process simulation; Learning Activity; Research and development; Sales and distribution; Simulation; Simulation analysis; Sales",,,,,,"Achimugu, P., Oluwagbemi, O., Oluwaranti, A., An evaluation of the impact of ICT diffusion in Nigeria’s higher educational institutions (2010) Journal of Information Technology Impact; Serrano, A., Hengst, M., Modeling the integration of BP and IT using business process simulation (2005) Journal or Enterprise Information Management, 18 (6), pp. 740-759; Popovic, A., Jaklic, J., Problematika simuliranja poslovnih procesov (2004) Proceedings of DSI 2004 - Management in Informatika, pp. 166-172. , Portoroz; Barber, K.D., Dewhurst, F.W., Burns, R.L.D., Rogers, J.B.B., Business-process modelling and simulation for manufacturing management: A practical way forward (2003) Business Process Management Journal, 9 (4), pp. 527-542; Damij, N., Damij, T., A Multi-disciplinary Guide to Theory, Modeling, and Methodology (2014) Progress in IS, , Berlin Heidelberg: Springer; Patig, S., Stolz, M., A pattern-based approach for the verification of business process descriptions (2013) Information and Software Technology, 55 (1), pp. 58-87. , Special section: Best papers from the 2nd International Symposium on Search Based Software Engineering, 2010; Savén, R., Olhager, J., Integration of product, process and functional orientations: Principles and a case study (2003) Collaborative Systems for Production Management, 129, pp. 375-389. , In: Jagdev H, Wortmann J, Pels H, editors. of IFIP—The International Federation for Information Processing.

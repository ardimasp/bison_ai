Because the pervasiveness of the problem scale, it may only be tamed effectively and efficiently by using an automatic grooming conversation detection system. The current study intends to address the issue by using Support Vector Machine and k-nearest neighbors' classifiers. Besides, the study also proposes a low-computational cost classification method, which classifies a conversation using the number of the existing grooming conversation characteristics. All proposed methods are evaluated using 150 textual conversations of which 105 are grooming, and 45 are non-grooming. We identify that grooming conversations possess 17 features of grooming characteristics. The results suggest that the SVM and k-NN can identify grooming conversations at 98.6% and 97.8% of the level of accuracy. Meanwhile, the proposed simple method has 96.8% accuracy. The empirical study also suggests that two among the seventeen characteristics are insignificant for the classification. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Grooming classifier; K-nearest neighbors; Online child grooming; Support vector machine",,,,,,"Olson, L.N., Daggs, J.L., Ellevold, B.L., Rogers, T.K., Entrapping the innocent: Toward a theory of child sexual predators' luring communication (2007) Communication Theory, 17 (3), pp. 231-251; Whittle, H., Hamilton-Giachritsis, C., Beech, A., Collings, G., A review of online grooming: Characteristics and concerns (2013) Aggression and violent behavior, 18 (1), pp. 62-70; Michalopoulos, D., Mavridis, I., Utilizing document classification for grooming attack recognition (2011) IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC), pp. 864-869; Kontostathis, A., Edwards, L., Leatherman, A., (2010) Text mining and cybercrime, Text Mining: Applications and Theory, , John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Chichester, UK; Mitchell, K.J., Finkelhor, D., Wolak, J., Police posing as juveniles online to catch sex offenders: Is it working?

Cyberbully and its impact have occurred around the world and now the number of cases are increasing. Cyberbullying detection is very important because the online information is too large so it is not possible to be tracked by humans. The purpose of this research is to construct a classification model with optimal accuracy in identifying cyberbully conversation using Naive Bayes method and Support Vector Machine (SVM) then applying n-gram 1 to 5 for the number of class 2, 4, and 11 for each method. Naive Bayes yields an average accuracy of 92.81%, SVM with a poly kernel yields an average accuracy of 97.11% It can be concluded that SVM with poly kernel yields higher accuracy than SVM with other kernels, Naive Bayes, and Kelly Reynolds research method of decision tree (J48) and k-NN. © 2017 IEEE.","cyberbully; naive bayes; support vector machine","Classifiers; Computer crime; Decision trees; Nearest neighbor search; Text mining; Classification models; Cyber bullying; Cyberbully; Naive bayes; Number of class; On-line information; Optimal accuracy; research methods; Support vector machines",,,,,"Kowalski, R.M., Limber, S.P., Agatston, P.W., (2012) Cyberbullying: Bullying in the Digital Age, , West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell; Poland, S., (2010) Cyberbullying Continues to Challenge Educators, 1, p. 5. , https://www.districtadministration.com/article/cyberbullyingcontinues-challenge-educators, [Online]; Shapka, J., Amos, H., (2012) Cyberbullying and Bullying Are Not the Same: UBC Research, , http://news.ubc.ca/2012/04/13/cyberbullying-and-bullying-are-notthe-same-ubc-research/, 13 April, [Online]; Yin, D., Xue, Z., Hong, L., Detection of harassment on web 2.0 (2009) Content Analysis in the WEB 2.0 (CAW2.0) Workshop at WWW 2009, pp. 1-7; Dinakar, K., Reichart, R., Lieberman, H., Modeling the detection of textual cyberbullying (2011) International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, pp. 11-17; Reynolds, K., Using machine learning to detect cyberbullying (2012) The Faculty of Ursinus College in Fulfillment of the Requirements for Distinguished Honors in Computer Science, pp. 1-4; Hee, C.V., Lefever, E., Verhoeven, B., Mennes, J., Desmet, B., Pauw, G.D., Daelemans, W., Hoste, V., Automatic detection and prevention of cyberbullying (2015) HUSO 2015: The First International Conference on Human and Social Analytics, pp. 13-18; Vercellis, C., (2009) Business Intelligence: Data Mining and Optimization for Decision Making, , Politecnico di Milano, Italy.: Wiley",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1st International Conference on Informatics and Computational Sciences, ICICoS 2017","15 November 2017 through 16 November 2017",,134505,,9781538609033,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

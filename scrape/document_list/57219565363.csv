However, sometimes there are situations where no one can accompany, especially if they are going out so that the person is out of control. Time limitations are often seen as the main cause of the absence of people accompanying them, so the availability of a system that can detect human activities or falls automatically becomes very important. Pervasive computing implemented by using smartphone can improve the quality of service by monitoring the user. Pervasive health monitory system provides activity detection and activity monitoring features to help user to see their activity profile, give suggestion to user, and notify the family or caretaker if the user fallen or show unusual activity. This proposed solution has a great impact for elderly to avoid more deadly risks rather than not using this solution because no one knows about the incident. © 2020 IEEE.","Activity detection; Fall; Health monitoring system; Pervasive; Smartphone","Information management; Ubiquitous computing; Activity detection; Activity monitoring; Activity profile; Aging population; Human activities; Out-of-control; Pervasive health monitoring systems; Pervasive healths; Quality of service",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

Non-invasive, inexpensive, and easy-to-use healthcare approaches becomes quite critical to support continuous health monitoring and the needs of healthcare. Smartphone is one of the devices that have limited specification. But smartphone is powerful enough to become human fall detection because it already been included with sensors and elderly has accepted and used it (especially in the future). Threshold-based low power consumption human fall detection by using accelerometer-based with four critical characteristics, Alpha Degree, and AGPeak can be the answer to solves the problem specially to achieve low power consumption computation. By using this thresholding-based fall detection method, it can be implemented in smartphone (low power device) and give fast classification result, under 0.001 second/data - below the realtime response tolerance. © 2020 IEEE.","Classification; Fall detection; Low power; Monitoring system; Smartphone; Threshold-based","Electric power utilization; Information management; Smartphones; Fall detection; Fast classification; Health monitoring; Human fall detection; Low-power consumption; Low-power devices; Monitoring system; Real-time response; mHealth",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

There many APIs and algorithms out there that can recognize human faces. These APIs or algorithms is called Artificial Intelligence or AI. As modern civilian life in modern society, AI has been used so many times and developed into something more. This time, we proposed an idea to recognize motions and emotions on human faces to detect their stress levels. Companies nowadays need to have something that can know how their employees are feeling or think about their work. This program works by taking an image input from mounted cameras on the office's monitor. However, before that, the program must have been trained first to recognize faces and emotions. For this, the eigenfaces algorithm is used. After the input is received, then the program will process the image received and extract the features from the images such as eyes, nose, mouth, etc. to detect if there are faces and also the emotions of the face. After that, the features extracted will be matched with the features in the database to give an output of the percentage of stress. © 2019 IEEE.","artificial neural network; eigenfaces; employee stress recognition; face stress recognition","Artificial intelligence; Engineering education; Personnel; Technology transfer; Corporate employees; Eigenfaces; Facial recognition; Human faces; Image inputs; Stress levels; Face recognition",,,,,"Delac, K., Grgic, M., Bartlett, M.S., (2008) Recent Advances in Face Recognition, , (1st ed.).

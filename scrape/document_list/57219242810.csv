There are many methods and algorithms use to solve optimization problem, but Genetic Algorithm will be explored in this paper. Genetic algorithm is meta heuristic method which able to answer goods delivery problems. Using correct fitness function formula, it can provide correct chromosomes value which enhance the delivery process. In this paper genetic algorithm is proposed to optimizing goods delivery in supply chain. It is found GA method able to answer this problem. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

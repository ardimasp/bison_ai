Most of the available datasets usually focus on either static expression, a short video of changing emotion from neutral to peak emotion, or difference in sounds to detect the current emotion of a person. Moreover, the common datasets were collected and processed in the United States (US) or Europe, and only several datasets were originated from Asia. In this paper, we present our effort to create a unique dataset that can fill in the gap by currently available datasets. At the time of writing, our datasets contain 10 full HD (1920×1080) video clips with annotated JSON file, which is in total 100 minutes of duration and the total size of 13 GB. We believe this dataset will be useful as a training and benchmark data for a variety of research topics regarding human facial and emotion recognition. © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.","Asian conversation dataset; Emotion recognition; Facial features expression; Mobile video; Multi-modal dataset; Recognition task",,,,,,"(2016) The Communications Market Report: International, , https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/multi-sector-research/cmr/cmr16/international, Ofcom., Dec; (2016) Weekly Smartphone Activities among Adult Users in the United States As of August 2016, , https://www.statista.com/statistics/187128/leading-us-smartphone-activities/, Statista, Sep; Palo, H.K., Mohanty, M.N., Classification of emotional speech of children using probabilistic neural network (2015) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 5 (2), p. 311; Gunawan, F.E., Idananta, K., Predicting the level of emotion by means of Indonesian speech signal (2017) Telkomnika, 15 (2); Salmam, F.Z., Madani, A., Kissi, M., Emotion recognition from facial expression based on fiducial points detection and using neural network (2017) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE), 8 (1); Lucey, P., Cohn, J.F., Kanade, T., Saragih, J., Ambadar, Z., Matthews, I., The extended cohn-kanade dataset (ck+): A complete dataset for action unit and emotion-specified expression (2010) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), 2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on, pp. 94-101; Gorodnichy, D.O., Video-based framework for face recognition in video (2005) Computer and Robot Vision, 2005.

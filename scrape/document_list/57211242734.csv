The comparison is in terms of Database response time. Their performance is compared using a common CRUD operations. Each operations data is analyzed using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test. Our comparison results confirm that Firebase Realtime Database is more suitable as our Daily Nutritional Needs Mobile Application Database Management System since it could perform better response time. The key features match our needs to provide Realtime Data and it is also help simplify the process of developing applications. © 2019 The Authors.

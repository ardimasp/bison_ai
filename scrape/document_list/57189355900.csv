If parking areas can take more space in a town/place, it will be good for the town itself because nowadays the problem is either no parking space or too much parking space which is not suitable for human space. Moreover, because our population keeps going up and space is reducing even, we have to cut the forest to make space for parking lots, which is not suitable for our ecosystem. The number of cars itself also increasing each year, which is so problematic in road and infrastructure management. To fix this, we need to have a sound management system for maximizing the use of available space in town and minimizing the traffic in the road. The problem nowadays is a roaming car that searching for parking space and making road traffic and making massive pollution for the town. When a car searching for a parking slot inside a building that is crowded, it will go around the parking lot, and there will be traffic inside the parking lot because many cars will queue searching for empty parking slots. This means that the driver will also waste many fuels, which is not suitable for the ecosystem. Since this problem has not been fixed yet and the population is increasing each year, and a new way of driving and parking system is required, we want to propose a new system that uses the processor board, wireless sensor network to fix the problem. © 2020 IEEE.","architecture; Car Parking System; Smart system; Wireless Sensor","Computer architecture; Ecosystems; Highway administration; Highway planning; Roads and streets; Infrastructure managements; Parking areas; Parking lots; Parking spaces; Parking systems; Processor boards; Road traffic; Sound management; Wireless sensor networks",,,,,,"(2013) Basu.

Research focus on students because students are one of the promising young age segments and many use technologies. This mobile banking service is needed by users to increase the mobility of the use of services at the bank for all financial transactions. The developed mobile banking must have several factors that must be met, among others: security factors in transactions and personal data information from users, user data confidentiality factors, risk factors in service use, trust factors of service users, service usability factors, and service factors in mobile banking. Data collection by distributing questionnaires using Google forms and the results obtained were 340 respondents. The analysis was performed using quantitative techniques with SEM with analysis software is SMARTPLS 3.0. The analysis shows that there are four factors that significantly influence the use mobile banking, namely Security and Confidentiality, Perceived Trust, Perceived Risk, Services Mobile Banking. In addition, there is one factor that the Perceived of use smartphones does not affect the use of services mobile banking. The results show that users need the security and confidentiality of personal data and transactions carried out. This will indirectly increase user confidence in mobile banking, and the bank must reduce or eliminate all risks caused by mobile banking services. Knowing the influence of these factors can increase mobile usage in mobile services and increase usage interest, and the bank knows which services can be improved. © 2020 IEEE.","Mobile banking; Perceived of use; Perceived risk; Perceived trust; Security and confidentiality; Smartphone","Information management; Mobile security; Risk assessment; Smartphones; Students; Surveys; Analysis softwares; Data collection; Data informations; Financial transactions; Perceived trusts; Quantitative techniques; Security factors; Service usability; Banking",,,,,,"Hellstrand, A., Breckwoldt, M., (2016) Consumer Acceptace of Mobile Banking in Germany, , May; Singh, S., Srivastava, R.K., Predicting the intention to use mobile banking in India (2018) Int.

Several cases had been reported due to the usage of a fake transcript. One modus of using fake transcript is to enter a higher level of education and job promotion. The new technology found called Blockchain believes in solving the problem. Characteristics of Blockchain Technology such as secured, immutable, distributed, transparent seem to be matched with transcript document requirement. Therefore, the research tries to create a process model of the university teaching and learning process. Several studies have been done; however, no detailed process shown especially for teaching and learning activities. The research question is, how are teaching, and learning activities can be supported by Blockchain Technology? Qualitative method used in this research, focus group discussion with 9 reputable universities discussed the academic operation process and the result show that it is possible to adopt Blockchain Technology into the teaching and learning process to avoid forgery of university transcript documents. © 2020 IEEE.","Blockchain technology; Blockchain technology-based; Teaching and learning process; Transcript","Blockchain; Information management; Teaching; Innovative solutions; Learning Activity; Level of educations; Operation process; Qualitative method; Research questions; Teaching and learning; University teaching; Learning systems",,,,"12/AKM/PNT/2019","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This study is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Implementasi Blockchain Platform Untuk Menciptakan “Good Governance” pada Perguruan Tinggi” or “The Implementation of Blockchain Platform to Create“Good Governance” in Higher Education” with contract number: 12/AKM/PNT/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","Ari, S., (2015) Perguruan Tinggi Harus Waspadai Transkrip Nilai Palsu-Tribun Jogja, , https://jogja.tribunnews.com/2015/01/09/perguruan-tinggi-haruswaspadai-transkrip-nilai-palsu, jogja.

In this part, the phenomena evolved in many countries. In line with this, early research reported the impact of learning using social media by researchers, both positive and negative impact on the university student. However, the researchers encountered demanding effort to obtain the research report on the causal impact of university student background, such as academic achievement, terms, and student social media behavioural activities. This ceaseless research attempts to explore the gap attributed. Therefore, this quantitative and causal or explanatory research will convey the social media impact of behavioural use for the learning of university student. The research involved 336 university students as the respondent in this research. Technically, SPPS application is used to process the data with Correlation Bivariate technique. The research found 29 correlations regarding the university student background and the activities of using media social for learning and a debatable result emerged from early research eventually. © 2020 IEEE.","Explanatory research; Quantitative method; Social media; Social media for learning; SPSS bivariate","Information management; Social networking (online); Academic achievements; Bivariate; Learning media; Research reports; Social media; University students; Students",,,,,,"Syed Ahmed, M., Kabir, S.M.A., The acceptance of smartphone as a mobile learning tool: Students of business studies in Bangladesh (2018) Malaysian Online J.

Knowledge management (KM) aims to support the creation, transfer, and application of knowledge in social societies. This fact illustrates that in the management of social knowledge, the role of social communities is very important and is influenced by factors in the process. With this, this study will look for theories and factors that influence KM social interactions that occur in social societies. The method used is a systematic literature review. The results of this study found theories and factors that influence KM in social societies. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Distribution process carried out the process of acquisition, purchase, storage, distribution, transport, repackaging, re-labeling, documentation, and record-keeping practices. The problems that occur in the validation process of each distribution process in each party involved are not well registered and integrated with each other, so in the complex drug distribution environment, the monitoring process becomes a necessity every time more urgent and primary to reduce theft, prevent counterfeiting, and improve efficiency, synchronization, visibility, and safety. Providing good tracking of goods gives consumers greater interest in the consumption of goods that meet certain ecological and ethical standards and thus requires the quality of the goods consumed. In this thought, it aims to discuss the best blockchain models for the drug distribution process. This research is qualitative research. As a result, the model was introduced as a potential blockchain model and could be applied in pharmaceutical companies in Indonesia.

Where this time, raising problems one of the social distancing that affects a service provided, especially on services that use technology that applies SST. This study develops from previous research where the customer has satisfaction in using SST services. Still, this use does not know a person intention to use SST services, so it is necessary to develop with several factors the adoption of technology, namely influence that can make a person intention to use. The research framework of this research consists of several factors and indicators, namely efficiency (4 indicators), Reliability (4 indicators), security (3 indicators), Convenience (3 indicators), Ease of use (4 indicators). This study uses an online survey with google form for users of self-service technology services in 5 major cities in Indonesia. Dissemination of the survey for three months, and the obtained were 100 respondents valid. This research conducts testing using Smarpls v3.0. The results of this study found two factors that influence perceived usefulness, namely: efficiency and reliability, and found three factors that did not have an impact, namely Security factors, Convenience Factors, Perceived Ease of use, and Service Trust do not have an impact on perceived usefulness. This result is a very interesting finding because during the period pandemic COVID-19. These factors are no longer the top priority in the use of SST services and do not affect who intention to use a technology service. Thus, it can be concluded that whose intention at a certain level of the problem will prioritize the reliability and efficiency of the system for service. This factor can be the focus of the company in developing systems that adopt Self-service technology. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Discussion forums, also referred to as a means to discuss all learning materials and conference systems, are also a means to discuss the material as a substitute for face-to-face meetings between students and lecturers. This phenomenon is also found in online learning. Unfortunately, online learning is not supported by 24-hour real-time lecturer responses. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify, analyze needs, and design Chatbots that can be used as role models to develop LMS as an intelligent academic information system, especially to support 24 hours of interactive learning processes in all subjects. This study uses the Natural Language Processing approach to generate responses such as daily conversations. The analysis is done and used to design chatbots that can maximize LMS work that is smart and can help student learning activities, especially around the most frequently asked questions. After being tested on several subjects in the Information System Engineering group, it is known that Chatbot can interact with students like having daily conversations. In the future, the results of this study are used as supporting systems for recommendations on smart LMS. © 2019 IEEE.","Chatbot; Massive Online Open Courses; Natural Language Processing; Smart LMS","E-learning; Information systems; Information use; Natural language processing systems; Students; Chatbot; Face-to-face meetings; Frequently asked questions; Interactive learning; Massive Online Open Courses; NAtural language processing; Smart LMS; Supporting systems; Learning systems",,,,,,"Serban, I.V., Sankar, C., Germain, M., Zhang, S., Lin, Z., Subramanian, S., Rajeshwar, S., (2017) A Deep Reinforcement Learning Chatbot, , arXiv preprint arXiv, 1709.02349; Hone, K.S., El Said, G.R., Exploring the factors affecting MOOC retention: A survey study (2016) Computers & Education, 98, pp. 157-168; Lalwani, T., Bhalotia, S., Pal, A., Bisen, S., Rathod, V., (2018) Implementation of a Chat Bot System Using AI and NLP; Weizenbaum, J., ELIZA-a computer program for the study of natural language communication between man and machine (1966) Communications of the ACM, 9 (1), pp. 36-45; Radziwill, N.M., Benton, M.C., (2017) Evaluating Quality of Chatbots and Intelligent Conversational Agents, , arXiv preprint arXiv, 1704.04579; Shawar, B.A., Atwell, E., Chatbots: Are they really useful?

It aims to find algorithms that excel in performance. The performance, which is a measure is the time and memory used to encrypt and decrypt with the same key-the method used in research with an experimental approach. Where experimental done on Raspberry PI with PHP programming language, the results of this study indicate that the AES algorithm requires a shorter time in encrypting messages compared to the DES algorithm. The AES algorithm uses a larger memory capacity in encrypting messages compared to the DES algorithm. The AES algorithm is recommended to use because in terms of security AES has a more significant number of keys that is 128 bits while the DES algorithm has a key length of 64 bits or half of the number of keys in the AES Algorithm. The results of the comparison of the two algorithms can be used as a reference where two encryption algorithms are compatible with the applications and devices developed. © 2019 IEEE.","AES; DES; Performance Comparison; Raspberry PI; Symmetries Encryption Algorithm","Engineering; AES algorithms; DES algorithms; Encryption algorithms; Experimental approaches; Key lengths; Memory capacity; Performance comparison; Cryptography",,,,,,"Chaitanaya, G., Keerthi, B., Saleem, A., Rao, A.T., Kumar, K.T.P.S., An image encryption and decryption using chaos algorithm (2015) IOSR J.

In this line, GoJek is one of the most famous Online Transportation Companies (OTC). As this backdrop, early research reported that single female used the Online Transportation System frequently. In the other angle, passenger's safety, especially for female passenger, has become issues. In this scope, several new findings reported the victim of female passengers. From that lesson, National Police advises the OTC to perform the physiological test for the driver due to security concern. Therefore, the research explored the relationship between the risk factor of the online transportation system for female passenger. In this study, SPSS is used to find the correlation bivariate function and to explain how extent the correlation of risk factor with the passenger background is. In this frame, the research involved 408 respondents of female customer online transportation passenger. Ultimately, fourteen significant correlations are obtained between respondent background and risk factor.

The face is a biometric feature with the intrinsic nature of a human. So that the face has self-stability, deep individual differences and can be an ideal basis for verification of an identity. In this research use, Deep Learning Network method uses to perform detection or face recognition. In this study, we present a framework that can be used to detect faces. This research is also able to present a DNN model that is used to study data sources from the data stream in sequence. The most important part of this study is able to adjust the capacity of the model from the simple one. This research uses experimental design method. The first step is a collection of face image data. Then the architecture design starts from the determination of the depth of the network, layout layers, and the selection of layer types that will be used to get the model based on input dataset and label name index. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Deep neural networks; Network layers; Neural networks; Architecture designs; Biometric features; Convolutional neural network; Experimental design method; Face recognition systems; Individual Differences; Intrinsic nature; Learning network; Face recognition",,,,,,"Howard, W.R., (2008) Biometric System and Data Analysis: Design, Evaluation, and Data Mining, 38, p. 1637. , (New York, NY: Springer 2008) Biometric System and Data Analysis: Design, Evaluation, and Data Mining20092Ted Dunstone and Neil Yager 268 pp.,978-0-387-77625-5 (contact www.springer.com for current price),quot; Kybernetes Oct. 2009; Siagian, P., Fernando, E., Authentication Login E-Library with Multimodal Biometrics System in (2014) International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics, pp. 20-21. , 2014 August; Charifa, M.S., Suliman, Bikdash, M., Face Recognition Using a Hybrid General Backpropagation Neural Network (2007) IEEE Int.

With the vastness of the area, Indonesia has so many and scattered tourist attractions. Indonesia is also a target of tourism by local and foreign tourists. Problems that occur are many tourist attractions that can not be known by tourists so that they experience a severe problem in getting information related to the culinary. One of the problems of information about its existence, which is spread in several locations and knowledge about the area that is not good, especially for tourists from outside the city. Of course, if this is ignored continuously will have a negative impact on culinary tourism, such as the lonely tourists who come to visit in the country of Indonesia. This study provides a solution that is seen from the existing problems; it is necessary to answer the need for fast and more efficient information about culinary attractions in Indonesia, namely by developing an Android-based GIS-based application that provides an easy search for information and culinary tourism locations. User required. Software development uses the waterfall method and tests on users with questionnaires to users.

The renewal of this research is to add access to subject matter features and discussion forum features. These features do not yet exist in the chatbot application system in other studies. Authentication on the chatbot is needed to find out who the user is accessing the chatbot for the material, discussion forum, and work on the problem training and National Examination exercises. E-learning innovation from chatbots is integrated with the LINE and CMS messaging mobile application that contains subject matter, exam practice, discussion forums, and evaluation of student evaluations. This system supports students who have limited time to attend traditional face-to-face classes and have limited access to laptops. The results of this study prove that Chatbot on smartphones can maximize student learning functions, increase student interest and achievement (value). © 2019 IEEE","Chatbot; Content Management System; LINE","C (programming language); Knowledge engineering; Mobile computing; Students; Application systems; Chatbot; Content management system; Learning support systems; LINE; Mobile applications; Research objectives; Student evaluation; Learning systems",,,,,,"Noesgaard, S.S., Ørngreen, R., The effectiveness of e-learning: An explorative and integrative review of the definitions, methodologies and factors that promote e-learning effectiveness (2015) Electronic Journal of E-Learning, 13 (4), pp. 278-290; Roos, S., (2018) Chatbots in Education: A Passing Trend or a Valuable Pedagogical Tool?; Pereira, J., Leveraging chatbots to improve self-guided learning through conversational quizzes (2016) Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality, pp. 911-918. , November.

In this point, the transaction raises several new and crucial challenges. At a closer look, the concerns appeared due to no data integration, verification, and validation from parties both inside or outside of the university. In this respect, the data is not centralized or integrated. As this backdrop, this causes repeated data confirmation, and no one can authenticate the data validity when distributed to other parties. In this point of entry, the diploma certification forgery has become one of the significant issues in education in Indonesia. As a framework that enables the data integration, Blockchain contains verified data on every single of a transaction, so the data is trustworthy. With this in mind, this paper aims to discuss the best blockchain model for the university level. This study is qualitative-based research. As a result, McRhys model is introduced as a potential and implementable blockchain model in university in Indonesia. © 2019 IADIS Press.

Prior’s research reveals that motivation as primary driver for people to perform knowledge sharing. Previous study also indicated people influenced by internal (intrinsic) and external (extrinsic) motivation when perform the knowledge sharing. The aim of this article is to investigate and explores how the elements of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation contribute to people intention in perform knowledge sharing in virtual communities. Moreover this study would confirm and understand how this knowledge sharing behavior occurs in Indonesia Context. Many literatures argue that different culture context would produce different of people belief and behavior. This study conducts a survey in a formal virtual community of practices members in one Indonesia Company. Two hundred and four respondents participated in this study. Data was analysis using SEM with Smart PLS Software. This study found that both of those motivations (intrinsic and extrinsic) are positively influences behavior of people knowledge sharing in formal Virtual Communities of Practices.

This system does not yet have a system that is integrated with each other and the security that is necessary to develop a system that leads towards it. Services provided requires an integrated system of all related system, the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to be used as an efficient solution for integrating distributed applications. In SOA-based environment that focuses on quality of service called WSARCH (Web Services Architecture). With this paper can then propose a system that uses a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) with Web Services Architecture to resolve accurately than techniques that have a lower negative impact in terms of service performance and security. © 2014, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

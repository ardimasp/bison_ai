This study aims to create applications that help tourists find information about tourism in North Sumatra, Indonesia easily. This application provides information in two languages: English and Bahasa Indonesia. The information includes recommended tourist destination, photos and descriptions of tourist attractions. This application acts as a tour guide base on service by using mobile devices specifically for Android users. To find out the influence of the use of this tourism application on the user's interest, the application is evaluated by potential users. Evaluation is carried out using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The results of evaluating the use of tourism applications concluded that the behavioral intention for the proposed tourism applications is 63.4%. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

According to Bank Indonesia (BI) standars, if a bank has a non performing loan (NPL) or a value above 5% so the bank suffers losses. In this case, the bank must have a strategy to reduce this value to be stable. Bank XYZ concern about performance of collectors because the collector is the core of the bank. The solution for this case study is using business intelligence carried on the data warehouse and OLAP development. So this paper describes how important the selection of data that can help managers to make decision so that performance can be better. © 2018 IEEE.","Business Intelligence; Data Warehouse; Loan Colection","Citrus fruits; Competitive intelligence; Data warehouses; Collection performance; Indonesia; Loan Colection; Information analysis",,,,,"Reinhart, C., Rogoff, K., (2010) From Financial Crash to Debt Crisis, , NBER Working Paper 15795; Murphy, S.N., Avillach, P., Bellazi, R., Phillips, L., Gabetta, M., Eran, A., McDuffie, M.T., Kohane, I.S., Combining clinical and geonomics queris using i2b2-Three methods (2017) PloS One; Abelló, A., Romero, O., Pedersen, T.B., Berlanga, R., Nebot, V., Aramburu, M.J., Simitsis, A., Using semantic web technologies for exploratory OLAP: A survey (2015) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 27 (2), pp. 571-588; Kimball, R., Ross, M., (2016) The Kimball Group Reader: Relentlessly Practical Tools for Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence Remastered Collection 2 Ed, , John Wiley & Sons; Negash, S., (2004) Business Intelligence, Communications of the Association Systems, 13, pp. 177-195; Olszak, Celina, M., Zeimba, E., (2007) Approach to Building and Implementing.

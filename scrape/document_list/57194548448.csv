The availability of the internet opens up opportunities for companies to get relatively inexpensive resources without space and time limits, one of which is the use of cloud computing to support the company's business processes. Various types of companies have used cloud computing to run their businesses, one of which is SMEs. This paper aims to find out the success factors for using cloud computing for SMEs. A systematic literature review was conducted on 45 journal articles to get the results. The inspected journal paper were available from 2008 to 2018 and displayed 14 success aspects for cloud computing for SMEs. The main factor is organizational support to implementation cloud computing. This research only talks about the use of service cloud computing in Small Medium Enterprise. It is expected that future research will discuss other issues related to the application of cloud computing in Small Medium Enterprises. © 2020 IEEE.","Cloud computing; CSF; SLR; SMEs","Information management; Business Process; Journal articles; Organizational support; Service clouds; Small medium enterprise; Space and time; Success factors; Systematic literature review; Cloud computing",,,,,"Inayatulloh, Successful of smes through electronic commerce learning (2020) International Journal of Innovation, Creativity and Change, , E-ISSN: 2201-1323.

Therefore, the use of knowledge should be managed and developed properly to produce maximum benefits, and to support the organisation's objectives. Although knowledge is considered important, many organisations in Indonesia still face many difficulties to measure and implement effective knowledge management (KM). Many corporations have reported major failures in adopting KM system. There is very few reference can be found especially for Indonesian corporations, to apply an effective KM that provides maximum benefits. The article examines the application of knowledge management system (KMS) in XYZ Co., a large IT service company, that serves major large corporations in Indonesia with the purpose to provide a reference of KMS application. The article adopts the successful KMS implementation based on the maturity level that was developed by Uday Kulkarni, Robert St. Louis, and Intel Corp. KMS maturity level has advantages in providing systematic thinking that commonly ignored by the Indonesian corporations. The KMS maturity model has been widely applied in major corporations and produced significant results. The article combines both KMS maturity model and 10-step KM roadmap developed by Armit Tiwana to maximize the output of KMS. The outcome of article is expected to be used as a reference for large corporation in Indonesia to apply KMS. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS","KM Maturity Model; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Management Maturity Level; Knowledge Management System",,,,,,"Tiwana, A., Williams, M., (2000) The Essential Guide to Knowledge Management:: E-Business and Crm Applications, , Prentice Hall PTR; Chigada, J., The role of knowledge management in enhancing organisational performance in selected banks of South Africa (2014) Information Science, , University of South Africa, Pretoria; Alavi, M., Leidner, D.E., Knowledge management and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Q, pp. 107-136; Foote, A., Halawi, L.A., Knowledge management models within information technology projects (2018) J.

On the other hand this system can reduce waiting time for each barbershop and salon. The methodology used to analyze system requirements is to compile a list of questions and disseminate with online Google docs and analyze using partial correlation. The data obtained is then processed to get an overview of the need for this system to be developed. As a result of this research, the Online Reservation System is suitable for use to reduce customer waiting time. Based on our research, it can be concluded that the majority of respondents who go to a salon or Barbershop are young people aged between 21 and 30 years (52%) or aged between 17 and 20 years (43%) with the student profession (85%).

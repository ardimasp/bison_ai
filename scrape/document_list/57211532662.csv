The research aims to explore the benefits of information exchange among community members and explore the community utilization for the development of their business. The research also aims to review the role of community for the members. This research is a qualitative research using phenomenology approach. Research objects are community members of micro and small enterprises, while Informants in this study amounted to five people consisting of two micro entrepreneurs and 3 three small entrepreneurs. The research analysis tool used is Phenomenology. The results of this study indicate that the interaction of micro and small business community members through WhatsApp group is very dynamic. The networking that occurs among community members is not only a common friendship but also sharing of business information, business transactions, and business partnerships. Community members feel very helpful in doing business with the community existance. Many members increase their sales turnover because they are actively involved in WhatsApp group. This is because trough WhatsApp group, the community members can promote their products and/or services freely. Furthermore, information sharing is regularly done through WhatsApp groups, such as business plan preparation training, exhibition activities, access to cheap and quality raw materials, potential business opportunities, financial governance, and business legality management. Hence, community can bridge connectivity among members, resulting in a growing sense of togetherness and loyalty among them. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

Effective assessment system requires mastering professional knowledge and skill. The background idea of making the system is to ensure that all students receive fair treatment during the process of learning Chinese. In this study, the authors purpose the analytical concept study of multiple-choice web-based formative assessment; namely web-based formative assessment system (web course system, online Q&A system, online testing system, intelligent management system, learning management system), and paper and pencil test. This paper focus on features, strategy, and effectiveness in the transition from conventional learning to e-learning environment. This paper also purposing problem and solution in the transition, and how the educator can use the assessment system to check student's knowledge after the teachings. Hence, the paper will not present the application used (ChinaLatex) since the author main purpose is sharing the idea behind it and give insight.

In spite of that, the objective of this paper is to share the application ideas from crypto-ransomware attack method toward future prevention mechanism application to make the Big Data Architecture more immune from future ransomware attack. The method used in this paper is systematic-review. The result is application prevention mechanism named as SeCBD which abbreviation for ""Secure Big Data"".

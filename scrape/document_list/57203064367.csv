The development of the system is needed because the various separate source and data is not always available when Information Systems Department wants to do monitoring of student performance. Moreover, the data are not available on time that's make monitoring process becomes hampered so that the impact on the result of the student's performance. Therefore, this system is also to make it easier for users of the system to be able to view the performance of students in accordance with the data that is needed in the process of monitoring. The development of the systems is using System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) method, starting from the planning phase to planning the development of the system, then perform the analysis on the process of monitoring that is currently running and analyze the data related to the process of monitoring, then entered the stage of design to design the system that will be built into diagrams, then the last stage is the building of the monitoring system success students study based on web platform. In the student performance monitoring system there will be a data of students who have not yet reached minimum indicators, students who achieve minimum indicators and students who have passed the minimum limit indicator. From the data, users can also view every detail of each indicator. The data that user needs to monitor will be available in one place in the system monitoring and data can be used at any time in. © 2017 IEEE.","indicator; monitoring; student; study; success","Indicators (instruments); Information management; Life cycle; Students; Monitoring process; Student performance; Student performance monitoring; Student's performance; study; success; System development life cycles; System monitoring; Monitoring",,,,,"(2010) Belajar Dan Faktor-Faktor Yang Mempengaruhinya, , Slameto, Jakarta: Rineka Cipta; Regier, J., Why is academic success important (2011) Applied Science and Technology Scholarship; Clark, G., Walker, M., Whittle, R., Attendance and Performance: Correlations and motives in lecture-based modules (2011) Journal of Geography in Higher Education, pp. 199-215; Cohn, E., Johnson, E., Class attendance and performance in principles of economics (2006) Education Economics, pp. 211-233; Davidovitch, N., Soen, D., Class attendance and students' evaluation of their college instructors (2006) College Student Journal, pp. 691-703; Chen, J., Lin, T., Class attendance and exam performance: A randomized experiment (2006) Society of Labor Economics (SOLE) Eleventh Annual Meetings, pp. 5-6; Silvestri, L., The effects of attendance on undergraduate methods course grades (2003) Education, 123, pp. 483-486; Van Schalkwyk, S., Menkveld, H., Ruiters, J., What's the story with class attendance?

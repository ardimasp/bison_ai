In this study, we propose an adaptive learning systems-knowledge level (ALS-KL) is a learning system that can personalize materials due to proficiency level of English language learners. A pre-test is given to measure the proficiency level of learners. The level is divided into elementary, intermediate and advanced. The ALS-KL provides the most suitable materials according to the needs of the learners. We applied the proposed system on 90 learners with different English proficiency level. The effectiveness of the system was evaluated using post-test. The results of the posttest showed that the proposed system was able to improve learners with intermediate- level and advanced level 1.5 times and 4 times respectively while reducing the number of learners with elementary-level by more than 50%. These indicate the effectiveness of the proposed system. © 2018 Kassel University Press GmbH.","Adaptive learning; ALS; E-learning; Knowledge level","Aluminum; E-learning; Adaptive learning; Adaptive learning systems; Elementary levels; English languages; Intermediate level; Knowledge level; Proficiency level; Traditional learning; Learning systems",,,,,"Judy, C.R.T., Hui-Chun, C., Gwo-Jen, H., Chin-Chung, T., Development of an adaptive learning system with two sources of personalization information (2008) Computers & Education, 51 (2), pp. 776-786. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2007.08.002; Siadaty, M., Taghiyareh, F., PALS2: Pedagogically adaptive learning system based on learning styles (2007) In Seventh IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT), pp. 616-618. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ICALT.2007.198; Chen, S., Zhang, J., The adaptive learning system based on learning style and cognitive state (2008) In Knowledge Acquisition and Modelling (KAM) International Symposium, pp. 302-306. , https://doi.org/10.1109/KAM.2008.60; Hämäläinen, W., General paradigms for implementing adaptive learning systems (2005) Proceedings of IADIS Virtual Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (MCCSIS); Thalmann, S., Adaptation criteria for the personalised delivery of learning materials: A multi-stage empirical investigation (2014) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 30 (1), pp. 45-60. , https://doi.org/10.14742/ajet.235; Chaplot, D.S., Rhim, E., Kim, J., Personalized adaptive learning using neural networks (2016) In: Proceedings of 3rd ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale, pp. 165-168. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2876034.2893397; Battou, A., Zohr, I., El Mezouary, A., Mammass, D., Towards an Adaptive Learning System Based on a New Learning Object Granularity Approach (2011) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 2 (9), pp. 8-14. , https://doi.org/10.14569/IJACSA.2011.020902; Somyürek, S., Student modeling: Recognizing the individual needs of users in elearning environments (2009) International Journal of Human Sciences, 6 (2), pp. 429-450; Popescu, E., Badica, C., Moraret, L., Accommodating learning styles in an adaptive educational system (2010) Informatica, 34 (4), pp. 451-462; Popescu, E., Badica, C., Moraret, L., WELSA: An intelligent and adaptive Webbased educational system (2009) In Proceedings of the 3rd symposium on intelligent distributed computing, pp. 175-185. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-03214-1_17; Mustafa, Y.E.A., Sharif, S.M., An approach to adaptive e-learning hypermedia system based on learning styles (AEHS-LS): Implementation and evaluation (2011) International Journal of Library and Information Science, 3 (1), pp. 15-28; Tsortanidou, X., Karagiannidis, C., Koumpis, A., Adaptive Educational Hypermedia Systems based on Learning Styles: The Case of Adaptation Rules (2017), 12 (5), pp. 116-150. , https://doi.org/10.3991/ijet.v12i05.6967; Yang, T.C., Hwang, G.J., Yang, S.J.H., Development of an Adaptive Learning System with Multiple Perspectives based on Students?

One of the main factors is the implementation of the project management related for product and services. This paper discusses how project management as a model able to increase success rate of digital startup project. The research data was obtained from a questionnaire with the criteria of the company in the sector of digital content providers. In this study, researchers conducted a test model of project management combined 10 knowledge areas of Project Management with the Triple Constraints using smartPLS approach Start Equation Model (SEM) to determine the model tested is significant with the data available today can improve a project's success digital start-up company. © 2016 IEEE.","10 Knowledge Area; Project Management; smartPLS; Structural Equation Model; Triple Constraint","Digital contents; Equation models; Knowledge areas; Product and services; smartPLS; Start-up companies; Structural equation modeling; Triple Constraint; Project management",,,,,"Hewagamage, C., Hewagamage, K.P., Redesigned framework and approach for IT project management (2011) Int.

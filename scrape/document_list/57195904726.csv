Inspired by the concept of parasocial interaction, the authors researched whether parasocial interaction could be used by universities to build a closer relationship with prospective students. Three different constructs of parasocial interaction were researched, to gauge their effect on a prospective student's intention to enrol in a university and share information by electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM): 1) perceived interactivity; 2) openness; 3) knowledge. Data collection was done by surveying 311, 12th grade students in Indonesia, and processed using partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS SEM). The results showed that parasocial interaction has a positive and significant impact on prospective students' intention to enrol in universities and encourage information sharing through eWOM. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Electronic word-of-mouth; EWOM; Parasocial interaction; PLS SEM; Prospective students; Universities",,,,,,"Bruno Sablan is a faculty member in the School of Information Systems and English Department at the Bina Nusantara University.

The analytical method used is the Structural Equation Model (SEM) with a software tool SMARTPLS 3. The results of this research can identify the critical success factors (CSFs) in the implementation of the education ERP system in university and its relationship with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and user satisfaction variables. The object of this research is the education ERP system called BINUS Campus Solution (BCS) that is implemented at BINUS University. The conclusions that are obtained are CSFs from the implementation of the education ERP system in the university are training, technology selection adaptation, vendor relationship, and strategy fit. The ease of use has significant effect on benefits and user satisfaction. The benefits and strategy fit have a significant effect on user satisfaction. The training and vendor relationship have a significant effect on ease of use. All CSFs when combined together significantly affect the ease of use, benefits, and user satisfaction. © 2018 IEEE.","CSF; education ERP system; evaluation; TAM; university","Information management; Critical success factor; ERP system; Erp system implementations; evaluation; Structural equation modeling; Technology acceptance model; Technology selection; university; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,,"Al-Jabri, I.M., Antecedents of user satisfactionwith ERP systems: Mediation analyses (2015) Kybernetes, 44 (1), pp. 107-123; Mudaly, S., Singh, P., Olugbara, O.O., Improved technology acceptance model applied to study enterprise resource planning usage (2013) Proc. of the Science and Information Conference, , https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6661830/, 7-9 October 2013, London, UK [Online].

One of the tools that can be used to bridge between graduates and companies is an integrated career portal. This portal can be optimized to help industry find the employees they need from the alumni from university. On the other hand, this tool can help graduates to get job that suits their competency. By using the portal, alumni can hopefully minimize the number of unemployed university graduates and accelerate their absorption into job market. The development of this career portal will use agile methodology. Questionnaire was distributed to alumni and employers to collect information about what user need in the portal. The result of this research can create a career portal which integrated business process and social media. © 2017 IEEE.","agile methodology; e-Business; integrated career portal; social media","Employment; Information management; Social networking (online); Agile Methodologies; eBusiness; Industry sectors; Integrated business; Job market; Social media; University graduates; User need; Commerce",,,,,,"(2017) Education Indicators in Focus, , http://www.oecd.org/edu/skills-beyondschool/educationindicatorsinfocus.htm, (August 11).

The use of social CRM in the higher education industry lags behind many other industries primarily because social CRM models do not exist for higher education. This research aims to provide the critical success factors for implementing a social CRM system for higher education institutions in Jakarta, Indonesia. A questionnaire was sent to fifty eight private universities in Jakarta. Each questionnaire had one hundred thirteen questions which were sent to top level higher education officials in order to understand the critical success factors needed to build a social CRM model. Seventeen universities replied and sixteen critical success factors were identified as core components after performing a statistical technique named Principle Component Analysis (PCA). © 2017 IEEE.","Critical success factors (CSFs); Customer relationship management (CRM); Higher education; Principle component analysis (PCA); Social CRM model","Education; Factor analysis; Information systems; Metadata; Public relations; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Critical success factor; Customer relationship management; Higher education; Principle component analysis; Social crm; Principal component analysis",,,,,,"Greenberg, P., (2010) CRM Customer Relationship Management, Social CRM Strategies, Tools, and Techniques for Engaging Your Customers, at the Speed of Light, , Fourth Edition.

However, until now there is the negative impact of usage of mobile transportation system such as deception of mobile transportation account, robbery of the driver or passenger accompanied by murder. Therefore, this research by using the quantitative method with correlation bivariate will find the answer the correlation between safe and trust factors of mobile transportation. Do the passenger trust to the driver of mobile transportation? Do the passenger trust in mobile transportation system? Does the company mobile transportation brand image influence the passenger? Does the passenger feel safe using the mobile transportation system? The research found 37 significant correlation factors from 312 respondents. © 2018 IEEE.","Economic Sharing; Mobile Transportation system; Quantitative; Safe; Trust","Crime; Intelligent systems; Correlation factors; Positive value; Quantitative; Quantitative method; Safe; Transportation system; Trust; User behaviors; Behavioral research",,,,,,,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2018 International Seminar on Research of Information Technology and Intelligent Systems, ISRITI 2018","21 November 2018 through 22 November 2018",,152781,,9781538674222,,,"English","Int.

The recent economic crisis is known to have had a great impact on consumer behavior with regard to restaurants. Therefore, this study is primarily focused on exploring the effects on the traditional antecedents of satisfaction and revisit intentions as full-time restaurants attempt to come up with better marketing strategies. This study involved 150 respondents who recently visited a full-service restaurant within the period of one month prior to the data collection. A confirmatory factor analysis and a reliability analysis were used to test the reliability and validity of the measurements. The hypotheses testing was conducted using a simple and multiple linear regression analysis to test the suitability of the proposed model for measuring satisfaction and revisit intentions. The results of the study showed that atmosphere has a significant influence on customer satisfaction and revisit intention. Customer satisfaction was also found as one of the most significant factors impacting revisit intention in the full-service restaurant industry. Therefore, restaurant managers can use a combination of good price and exciting atmosphere to enhance satisfaction and revisit intention. This study provides insights on full-service restaurants in Indonesia which have not received much attention in both marketing and hospitality literature. © 2020, IGI Global.","Customer Satisfaction; Full-Service Restaurant; Revisit Intention; Service Marketing; Service Quality",,,,,,,"Al-Tit, A.A., The effect of service and food quality on customer satisfaction and hence customer retention (2015) Asian Social Science, 11 (23), pp. 129-139; Baker, J., Grewal, D., Parasuraman, A., The influence of store environment on quality inferences and store image (1994) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 22 (4), pp. 328-339; Barrows, C., Food and beverage management (2008) The SAGE Handbook of Hospitality Management, , Sage; Bei, L.T., Chiao, Y.C., An integrated model for the effects of perceived product, perceived service quality, and perceived price fairness on consumer satisfaction and loyalty (2001) Journal of Consumer Satisfaction, Dissatisfaction & Complaining Behavior, 14, pp. 125-140; Bojanic, D.C., Consumer perceptions on price, value and satisfaction in the hotel industry: An exploratory study (1996) Journal of Hospitality & Leisure Marketing, 4 (1), pp. 5-22; Bowen, D.E., Schneider, B., Boundary-spanning-role employees and the service encounter: Some guidelines for management and research (1985) The Service Encounter, pp. 127-147. , In J.A.

Despite their popularity, the MOOC participation rate in Indonesia is still very low. In addition, little is known about the adoption of MOOCs in Indonesia. This study explored MOOC adoption in Indonesia by investigating attitudes, awareness and the experience of working adults in Indonesia with MOOCs. Data was collected from 85 respondents, with 31 respondents having some experience with MOOCs. It was found that although the respondents generally had positive attitudes towards MOOCs, many of them were not familiar with MOOCs. The respondents who were familiar with MOOCs mostly held professions in the information technology and education fields. Lastly, MOOC users highlighted time management and commitment as the two most important factors which determined successful participation in a MOOC. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Distance learning; MOOCs; Qualitative study; Success factors; Technology adoption","Computer applications; Computer programming; Exploratory studies; Massive open online course; MOOCs; Participation rate; Qualitative study; Success factors; Technology adoption; Technology and educations; Distance education",,,,,,"(2018) Definition of MOOC in English, , https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/MOOC; Alraimi, K.M., Zo, H., Ciganek, A.P., Understanding the MOOCs continuance: The role of openness and reputation (2015) Computers & Education, 80, pp. 28-38. , Jan. 2015; Liyanagunawardena, T.R., Adams, A.A., Williams, S.A., MOOCs: A systematic study of the published literature 2008-2012 (2013) The Int.

A social network paradigm and a human-computer interaction concept is used to predict the type of eWOM, whether as an in-group or out-of-group. The study used a cross-sectional quantitative survey to test the hypotheses. A convenient sampling method was used to recruit 158 respondents, aged between 18 and 25 years, who were social media users. Data was analysed using a regression analysis. Mood enhancement was found as a significant predictor for experiential learning and escapism. Escapism in turn was found to be a significant predictor for social interactions. Both experiential learning and social interactions were discovered to be significant predictors for all social media perceptions: openness, participation, connectedness, conversationality, and commonality. Only social media perceptions, openness, and connectedness were found to be significant predictors for eWOM, for in-group and out-of-group. Social media motivation drivers that promote learning and social interactions can be used to make social media users proactive in engaging with the brand. The underlying social media motivation drivers create social media perceptions that demand the need for social media to be creative, adaptable, and sociable. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Electronic word of mouth; In-group and out-of-group; Motivation drivers; Social media; Social network",,,,,,,"Abrantes, J.L., Seabra, C., Lages, C.R., Jayawardhena, C., Drivers of in-group and out-of-group electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) (2013) European Journal of Marketing, 47 (7), pp. 1067-1088; Borgatti, S., Foster, P.C., The network paradigm in organizational research: A review and typology (2003) Journal of Management, 29 (6), pp. 991-1013. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0149-2063(03)00087-4; Chan-Olmsted, S.M., Cho, M., Lee, S., User perceptions of social media: A comparative study of perceived characteristics and user profiles by social media (2013) Online Journal of Communication and Media Technologies, 3 (4), pp. 149-178; Chu, S., Kim, Y., Determinants of consumer engagement in electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) in social networking sites (2011) International Journal of Advertising, 30 (1), pp. 47-75; Curras-Perez, R., Ruiz-Mafe, C., Sanz-Blas, S., Determinants of user behaviour and recommendation in social networks (2014) Industrial Management and Data System, 114 (9), pp. 1477-1498; Dholakia, U.M., Bagozzi, R.P., Pearo, L.K., A social influence model of consumer participation in network- And small-group-based virtual communities (2004) International Journal of Research in Marketing, 21, pp. 241-263; DiMaggio, P., Hargittai, E., Neuman, W., Robinson, J., Social implications of the internet (2001) Annual Review of Sociology, 27 (1), pp. 307-336. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307; Dix, A., Finlay, J.E., Abowd, G.D., Beale, R., (2005) Human-Computer Interaction, , New York: Pearson Education; Fischer, E., Reuber, R., Social interaction via new social media: (How) can interactions on twitter affect effectual thinking and behaviour?

This research aims to investigate the various factors contributing to the research productivity of university faculty members through the use of decision tree modeling. Three separate models, each for junior, intermediate, and senior faculty members, were developed to quantitatively predict individual faculty member's publication output in a specific target year. The models were trained and evaluated on a dataset containing academic profiles and past publications of 78 full-Time faculty members in Binus University International by using cross-validation. The overall accuracy of the models was above 80%, with the model for the junior faculty members achieved 100% accuracy. Several key findings were identified from this research. First, possession of doctoral degree was found to be a key identifier of productive junior faculty members. Second, length of service with university did not affect research productivity. Third, tenured faculty members were identified to be productive in research after two years of consistent publications. © 2015 IEEE.","decision tree; faculty members; prediction; publications; research productivity","Decision trees; Education; Forecasting; Productivity; Publishing; Software engineering; Cross validation; Decision tree modeling; Doctoral degrees; Faculty members; Length of service; Overall accuracies; publications; Research productivity; Teaching",,,,,,"FORLAP DIKTI Website, , http://forlap.dikti.go.id/dosen/homegraphjenjang, Retrieved on August 8 2015; Smith, J.S., Fox, G.L., Park, S.H., Lee, L., Institutional antecedents to research productivity in operations: The us perspective (2008) International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 28 (1), pp. 7-26; Bhagwatwar, A., Hara, N., Ynalvez, M.A., Out of asia: Understanding the nexus between technlogy usage and research productivity in japan, singapore, and taiwan (2013) International Journal of Information Management, 33 (6), pp. 963-970; Chien, C.F., Chen, L.F., Data mining to improve personnel selection and enhance human capital: A case study in high-Technology industry (2008) Expert Systems with Applications, 34 (1), pp. 280-290; Jantan, H., Hamdan, A.R., Othman, Z.A., Knowledge discovery techniques for talent forecasting in human resource application (2009) World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, 3 (2), pp. 579-587; Al-Radaideh, Q.A., Nagi, E.A., Using data mining techniques to build a classification model for predicting employees performance (2012) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 3 (2), pp. 144-151; Hall, M., Frank, E., Holmes, G., Pfahringer, B., Reutemann, P., Witten, A.H., The weka data mining software: An update (2009) SIGKDD Explorations, 11 (1), pp. 10-18; Quinlan, J.R., (1993) C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning, , Morgan Kaufmann; McCloughen, A., Brien, L.O., Jackson, D., Esteemed connection: Creating a mentoring relationship for nurse leadership (2009) Nursing Inquiry, 16 (4), pp. 326-336; Jacob, B.A., Lefgren, L., The impact of research grant funding on scientific productivity (2011) Journal of Public Economics, 95 (1), pp. 1168-1177; Hattie, J., Marsh, H.W., The relationship between research and teaching: A meta-Analysis (1996) Review of Educational Research, 66 (4), pp. 507-542; He, Z.-L., Geng, X.-S., Campbell-Hunt, C., Research collaboration and research output: A longitudinal study of 65 biomedical scientists in a new zealand university (2009) Research Policy, 38 (2), pp. 306-317; Van Rijnsoever, F.J., Hessels, L.K., Factors associated with disciplinary and interdisciplinary research collaboration (2011) Research Policy, 40 (3), pp. 463-472; Ye, Q., Song, H., Li, T., Cross-institutional collaboration networks in tourism and hospitality research (2012) Tourism Management Perspectives, 2-3, pp. 55-64",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","International Conference on Data and Software Engineering, ICODSE 2015","25 November 2015 through 26 November 2015",,120055,,9781467384285,,,"English","Proc.

The service process has been utilized as a means to create competitive advantages by many industries. The main purpose of this research is to explore the perceptions of non-users of self-service technology towards the potential convenience and control benefits of using the technology and how they influence the non-users’ overall perceptions of speed of transaction, trust in the service provider and future intentions to use the self-service technology. Design/Methodology/Approach—Cronbach’s Alpha and Confirmatory Factorial Analyses were utilized to determine reliability and validity of the constructs. Multiple linear regression and mediation analysis were used to determine whether there were any relationships between the variables. Result and Conclusion—The result concluded that both the perceived control and perceived convenience act as mediators between the relationship of speed of transaction, and trust in a service provider to intention to use self-service technology. The findings also show that both perceived control and perceived convenience can directly influence an individual’s intention to use self-service technology. Practical Implications—The findings suggest that it is important for companies to offer self-service technology that can increase customer’s perception of control and convenience as those characteristics can affect the customers’ intention to use self-service technology in the future. It is also crucial to emphasize the speed of transaction and trust in the service provider as both factors have a mediating impact between customers’ perceived control and perceived convenience towards their intentions to use self-service technology. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

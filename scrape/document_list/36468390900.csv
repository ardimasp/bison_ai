Education is important in creating superior national seeds. An important component in education problems that are often found in the evaluation system in the thesis process at the university often occurs data manipulation. The research aims to design the idea of applying Blockchain-Based Technology to the thesis discussion system at universities. Forum Group Discussion (FGD) is used to collect data related to business processes in the thesis assessment from beginning to end. The literature review is used as a means to support the theories or hypotheses proposed in this study. Therefore, this research proposes to give the idea of designing a system. Assessing the thesis uses Blockchain-Based Technology to eliminate cheating in practice and can also increase the potential in the world of education so that it can move forward in this era. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Therefore, we conducted a clinical trial of dexamethasone in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass. Methods: Sixty consecutive patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass were enrolled from August 2018 to January 2019 and randomized to a dexamethasone or placebo group of 30 each. Clinical outcomes were analyzed. Results: There was a lower incidence of major adverse cardiac events in the dexamethasone group compared to the placebo group (17% versus 43%, p = 0.024). Clinical outcomes in the dexamethasone group were better than those in the placebo group, in terms of duration of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.029), intensive care unit stay (p = 0.028), hospital stay (p = 0.04), and vasoactive-inotropic score (p = 0.045). There were significant differences in inflammatory markers between the two groups: interleukin-6 (p = 0.0001), procalcitonin (p = 0.0001), and C-reactive protein (p = 0.0001) were lower in the dexamethasone group. There was a significant association between the incidence of major adverse cardiac events and both interleukin-6 (p = 0.005) and procalcitonin (p = 0.007). Conclusion: Preoperative dexamethasone in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass is effective in improving clinical outcomes and controlling the postoperative inflammatory reaction. © The Author(s) 2020.","Anti-inflammatory agents; cardiopulmonary bypass; coronary artery bypass; dexamethasone; off-pump",,,,,,,"Raja, S.G., Dreyfus, G.D., Off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery: to do or not to do?

Distal perfusion may reduce abdominal organ injury, especially acute kidney injury (AKI). Methods: From 2009 to 2016, 56 patients who underwent ascending aortic and/or aortic arch surgery were enrolled. Open distal anastomosis was performed using one of three protection strategies: 1) systemic temperature of 25°C followed by selective cerebral perfusion (SCP) with lower body circulatory arrest (Group CA25, n=27); 2) systemic temperature of 28°C followed by SCP with lower body circulatory arrest (Group CA28, n=4); and 3) systemic temperature of 28°C followed by SCP with distal aortic perfusion (Group DP, n=25). Results: During the postoperative course, levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase and lactate in Groups CA28 and CA25 were significantly higher than those in Group DP. AKI defined by the AKI Network occurred in 28 cases (50%) and 3 cases required permanent hemodialysis. AKI was significantly higher in Groups CA25 and CA28 than in Group DP (p=0.026). Mid-term follow-up showed that patients who developed postoperative AKI were more likely to suffer from cardiovascular events. Conclusions: Distal perfusion during open distal anastomosis reduced kidney and liver injury after thoracic aortic surgery despite an increased body temperature of up to 28°C. This strategy may be useful to prevent AKI, liver dysfunction, the need for hemodialysis and multiple organ failure and could improve mid-term results. © The Author(s) 2018.","acute kidney injury; aortic surgery; hypothermia; organ protection; perfusion","creatinine; lactate dehydrogenase; lactic acid; liver enzyme; nitrogen; urea; abdominal injury; acute kidney failure; adult; aged; aneurysm surgery; aortic aneurysm; aortic arch; Article; ascending aorta; body temperature; brain perfusion; controlled study; female; follow up; heart arrest; human; major clinical study; male; organ perfusion; postoperative period; priority journal; protection; retrospective study; urea nitrogen blood level; abdomen; acute kidney failure; aortic aneurysm; middle aged; perfusion; risk factor; very elderly; young adult; Abdomen; Acute Kidney Injury; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aortic Aneurysm; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Perfusion; Risk Factors; Young Adult",,"creatinine, 19230-81-0, 60-27-5; lactate dehydrogenase, 9001-60-9; lactic acid, 113-21-3, 50-21-5; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; urea, 57-13-6",,,,"Peterss, S., Khaladj, N., Pichlmaier, M., Hypothermic circulatory arrest with “low flow” lower body perfusion: an experimental feasibility study of microcirculatory parameters (2011) Thorac Cardiovasc Surg, 59, pp. 335-341; Klodell, C.T., Hess, P.J., Beaver, T.M., Clark, D., Martin, T.D., Distal Aortic perfusion during aortic arch reconstruction: another tool for the aortic surgeon (2004) Ann Thorac Surg, 78, pp. 2196-2198; Della Corte, A., Scardone, M., Romano, G., Aortic arch surgery: thoracoabdominal perfusion during antegrade cerebral perfusion may reduce postoperative morbidity (2006) Ann Thorac Surg, 81, pp. 1358-1364; Hagl, C., Khaladj, N., Karck, M., Hypothermic circulatory arrest during ascending and aortic arch surgery: the theoretical impact of different cerebral perfusion techniques and other methods of cerebral protection (2003) Eur J Cardiothorac Surg, 24, pp. 371-378; Urbanski, P.P., Lenos, A., Bougioukakis, P., Neophytou, I., Zacher, M., Diegeler, A., Mild-to-moderate hypothermia in aortic arch surgery using circulatory arrest: a change of paradigm?

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which have regenerative capability and exert paracrine actions on damaged tissues, injected into rat models of spinal cord ischemia–reperfusion injury. Methods: Forty-five Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into sham, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and MSC groups. Spinal cord ischemia was induced in the latter two groups by balloon occlusion of the thoracic aorta. MSCs and PBS were then immediately injected into the left carotid artery of the MSC and PBS groups, respectively. Hindlimb motor function was evaluated at 6 and 24 hours. The spinal cord was removed at 24 hours after ischemia–reperfusion injury, and histologic and immunohistochemical analyses and real-time polymerase chain reaction assessments were performed. Results: Rats in the MSC and PBS groups showed flaccid paraparesis/paraplegia postoperatively. Hindlimb function was significantly better at 6 and 24 hours after ischemia–reperfusion injury in the MSC group than in the PBS group (p < 0.05). The number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive neuron cells in the spinal cord and the ratio of Bax to Bcl2 were significantly larger (p < 0.05) in the PBS group than in the MSC group. The injected MSCs were observed in the spinal cord 24 hours after ischemia–reperfusion injury. Conclusions: The MSC therapy by transarterial injection immediately after spinal cord ischemia–reperfusion injury may improve lower limb function by preventing apoptosis of neuron cells in the spinal cord. © 2018 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons",,"beta1 integrin;

We examined the synergistic effect of topical hypothermia of the spinal cord combined with radical scavenger infusion into the clamped segment of the aorta to prevent spinal cord damage in an animal model. Methods: Spinal cord ischemia was induced in rabbits by clamping the aorta between the renal artery and aortic bifurcation for 30 minutes. Rabbits were divided into four groups of 16 each: group I, sham-operated; group II, edaravone (6 mL, 4°C, 1 mg/kg); group III, saline (6 mL, 4°C) with transvertebral cooling pads; group IV, edaravone (6 mL, 4°C, 1 mg/kg) and transvertebral cooling pads. Solutions were injected into the clamped segment of the aorta. Postoperative assessments included the Tarlov score, spinal cord histopathology, and measurement of malondialdehyde levels in the spinal cord tissue. Results: At 48 hours after reperfusion, the mean Tarlov scores in groups I, II, III, and IV were 4.0, 1.5, 1.9, and 4.0, respectively. The mean number of normal motor neurons was significantly higher in groups I (54.1) and IV (53.7) than in groups II (32.8) and III (36.3; P <.001). The mean malondialdehyde level in groups I (19.8 nmol/mL) and IV (22.6 nmol/mL) was significantly lower than in groups II (64.8 nmol/mL) and III (60.9 nmol/mL; P <.001). At 168 hours after reperfusion, the mean Tarlov scores in groups I, II, III, and IV were 4.0, 1.1, 1.3, and 4.0, respectively. The mean number of normal motor neurons was significantly higher in groups I (52.9) and IV (50.8) than in groups II (22.4) and III (25.9; P <.001). The mean malondialdehyde level in groups I (20.7 nmol/mL) and IV (23.4 nmol/mL) was significantly lower than in groups II (68.9 nmol/mL) and III (61.6 nmol/mL; P <.001). Conclusion: In a rabbit model with aortic clamping up to 30 minutes, which consistently produces complete paraplegia in rabbits, spinal cord damage was partially reduced by topical cooling with transvertebral cooling pads or the injection of edaravone into the clamped segment of aorta, but was more effectively protected by a combined use of these two strategies. © 2011 Society for Vascular Surgery.",,"malonaldehyde; norphenazone; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; aorta bifurcation; aorta surgery; article; clinical feature; controlled study; nonhuman; postoperative care; priority journal; renal artery; reperfusion; sham procedure; single blind procedure; spinal cord injury; spinal cord ischemia; treatment outcome; Animals; Antipyrine; Aorta; Biological Markers; Combined Modality Therapy; Constriction; Disease Models, Animal; Free Radical Scavengers; Hypothermia, Induced; Infusions, Intra-Arterial; Malondialdehyde; Motor Neurons; Neurologic Examination; Neuroprotective Agents; Oxidative Stress; Paraplegia; Rabbits; Reperfusion Injury; Severity of Illness Index; Spinal Cord Ischemia; Time Factors; Vascular Surgical Procedures",,"malonaldehyde, 542-78-9; norphenazone, 89-25-8; Antipyrine, 60-80-0; Biological Markers; Free Radical Scavengers; Malondialdehyde, 542-78-9; Neuroprotective Agents; phenylmethylpyrazolone, 89-25-8",,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: 21591798",,"Wada, T., Yao, H., Miyamoto, T., Mukai, S., Yamamura, M., Prevention and detection of spinal cord injury during thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic repairs (2001) Ann Thorac Surg, 72, pp. 80-85; Acher, C.W., Wynn, M., A modern theory of paraplegia in the treatment of aneurysms of the thoracoabdominal aorta: An analysis of technique specific observed/expected ratios for paralysis (2009) J Vasc Surg, 49, pp. 1117-1124; Yamaguchi, T., Oishi, K., Uchida, M., Echizen, H., Edaravone, a radical scavenger, may enhance or produce antiproliferative effects of fluvastatin, amlodipine, ozagrel, GF109203X and Y27632 on cultured basilar artery smooth muscle cells (2003) Biological and Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 26 (12), pp. 1706-1710. , DOI 10.1248/bpb.26.1706; Watanabe, T., Morita, I., Nishi, H., Murota, S., Preventive effect of MCI-186 on 15-HPETE induced vascular endothelial cell injury in vitro (1988) Prost Leukot Essent Fatty Acid, 33, pp. 81-87; Watanabe, T., Yuki, S., Egawa, M., Nishi, H., Protective effects of MCI-186 on cerebral ischemia: Possible involvement of free radical scavenging and antioxidant actions (1994) Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 268 (3), pp. 1597-1604; Kawai, H., Nakai, H., Suga, M., Yuki, S., Watanabe, T., Saito, K.-I., Effects of a novel free radical scavenger, MCI-186, on ischemic brain damage in the rat distal middle cerebral artery occlusion model (1997) Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 281 (2), pp. 921-927; Hamaishi, M., Orihashi, K., Isaka, M., Kumagai, H., Takahashi, S., Okada, K., Low-dose edaravone injection into the clamped aorta prevents ischemic spinal cord injury (2009) Ann Vasc Surg, 23, pp. 128-135; Ueno, T., Furukawa, K., Katayama, Y., Itoh, T., Protection against ischemic spinal cord injury: One-shot perfusion cooling and percutaneous topical cooling (1994) Journal of Vascular Surgery, 19 (5), pp. 882-887; Cambria, R.P., Davison, J.K., Zannetti, S., L'Italien, G., Brewster, D.C., Gertler, J.P., Clinical experience with epidural cooling for spinal cord protection during thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair (1997) J Vasc Surg, 25, pp. 234-241; Sueda, T., Okada, K., Orihashi, K., Sugawara, Y., Kouchi, K., Imai, K., Cold blood spinal cord plegia for prediction of spinal cord ischemia during thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair (2002) Annals of Thoracic Surgery, 73 (4), pp. 1155-1159. , DOI 10.1016/S0003-4975(02)03405-7, PII S0003497502034057; Isaka, M., Kumagai, H., Sugawara, Y., Okada, K., Orihashi, K., Ohtaki, M., Sueda, T., Cold spinoplegia and transvertebral cooling pad reduce spinal cord injury during thoracoabdominal aortic surgery (2006) Journal of Vascular Surgery, 43 (6), pp. 1257-1262. , DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2006.02.017, PII S074152140600276X; Moore, W.M., Hollier, L.H., The influence of severity of spinal cord ischemia in the etiology of delayed-onset paraplegia (1991) Ann Surg, 213, pp. 427-431; Tarlov, I.M., (1957) Spinal Cord Compression: Mechanism of Paralysis and Treatment, p. 147. , Charles C.

Previous studies have demonstrated the relationship between neuronal vulnerability and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress after transient ischemia in the spinal cord. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA), a chemical chaperone that reduces the load of mutant or unfolded proteins retained in the ER during cellular stress, can protect against ischemic spinal cord damage. Methods Spinal cord ischemia was induced in rabbits by direct aortic cross-clamping (below the renal artery and above the bifurcation) for 15 minutes at normothermia. Group A (n = 6) was a sham operation control group. In group B (n = 6) and group C (n = 6), vehicle or 15 mg/kg/h of sodium 4-PBA was infused intravenously, respectively, from 30 minutes before the induction of ischemia until 30 minutes after reperfusion. Neurologic function was assessed at 8 hours, and 2 and 7 days after reperfusion with a Tarlov score. Histologic changes were studied with hematoxylin-eosin staining. Immunohistochemistry analysis for ER stress-related molecules, including caspase12 and GRP78 were examined. Results The mean Tarlov scores were 4.0 in every group at 8 hours, but were 4.0, 2.5, and 3.9 at 2 days; and 4.0, 0.7, and 4.0 at 7 days in groups A, B, and C, respectively. The numbers of intact motor neurons at 7 days after reperfusion were 47.4, 21.5, and 44.9 in groups A, B, and C, respectively. There was no significant difference in terms of viable neurons between groups A and C. Caspase12 and GRP78 immunoreactivities were induced in motor neurons in group B, whereas they were not observed in groups A and C. Conclusion Reduction in ER stress-induced spinal cord injury was achieved by the administration of 4-PBA. 4-PBA may be a strong candidate for use as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of ischemic spinal cord injury.

Using an ex vivo model of atrial septal defect, 3D echo-guided surgical procedures were attempted in three steps. First, grasping of the edge of the defect with a forceps was attempted. It was feasible in every direction. Reverberation artifact occasionally disturbed imaging of the defect edge. Second, transfixion suture of the facing edges was attempted. Guided by 3D echo, serial sutures were feasible, but interlocking of the thread was a pitfall. Third, continuous suture of the defect was attempted under 3D echo guidance. Following the initial suture bite on one side, continuous suture could be performed under echo guidance. Deformity of the Maniceps needle after repeated sutures was a limitation. In conclusion, suture closure of the defect under 3D echo guidance using the Maniceps system is feasible in an ex vivo ASD model as visualization is optimized by panel setting for guiding surgical procedures.","Atrial septal defect; Coronary artery bypass surgery; Echocardiography; Patent foramen ovale","article; artifact; echocardiography; heart atrium septum defect; image display; laparoscopic surgery; surgical instrument; suture; suturing method; three dimensional imaging; Echocardiography, Three-Dimensional; Heart Septal Defects, Atrial; Humans; Surgical Instruments; Suture Techniques",,,"Alfresa Pharma; MANI, Japan; Micro-line PENTAX, United States; Philips, Netherlands",,,"Baird, C.W., Stamou, S.C., Skipper, E., Watts, L., Total endoscopic repair of a pediatric atrial septal defect using the da Vinci robot and hypothermic fibrillation (2007) Interact.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a pattern of relations between rice availability and rice consumption so that a balance occurs in the management of rice availability. The method used is the System Dynamics model, where this method is able to formulate a complex system by utilizing historically existing data to form a model, therefore this approach is expected to form a performance model of balance between rice availability and consumption which can then be simulated to predict needs in the future so that it can be used for faster and more accurate decision making. © BEIESP.","Modelsimulation; Rice availability; System dynamics",,,,,,"Junzeng, X., Bai, W., Li, Y., Wang, H., Wei, Z., Modeling rice development and field water balance using AquaCrop model under drying-wetting cycle condition in eastern China (2019) Agricultural Water Management, 213, pp. 289-297; Muhammadi, E.A., Soesilo, B., (2001) Analisa Sistem Dinamis ‘Lingkungan Hidup, , Sosial.

Nowadays, NFC implementation usually concern in business transaction to replace conventional ways, such as cash and card transaction. But, NFC can be a good opportunity in education industry to support automated several education activities. Nowadays, most of Indonesian people already used Smartphone and familiar with NFC technology, but still don’t have opportunity to use NFC because there is no industry or transaction already use NFC tag in Indonesia. This paper discussed NFC design for education industry, especially for attendance system that can be one of university’s competitive advantages. NFC can support universities attendance system to make it simple and faster that can replaced conventional way. This study conducted by interview and observation at several universities in Jakarta to know about current attendance system mechanism, thus come up with new mechanism by using NFC technology. The conclusion is that NFC technology could be used to automate attendance system, make it faster and easy to use that can improve university’s academic operation performance. © IAEME Publication.","Attendance System; NFC; Universities",,,,,,"Pearson, K.E., Saunders, C.S., (2009) Strategic Management Information Systems, , Florida: John Willey & Sons, Inc, 2009; Ekbote, S., A robust student attendance monitoring system using NFC technology and biometrics (2015) International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication, pp. 5600-5603; Bekir Bilginer, P.-L.L., (2011) Near Field Communication, , Retrieved December 2014.Sweden: Lunds University; Anuj Yadav, A.S., Near field communication, an era of smart touch (2014) Journal of the International Association of Advanced Technology and Science, 15. , September 2014; Harsh Kotak, P.M., Automated car parking system with nfc access (2013) International Journal of Electronics and Communication Engineering & Technology (IJECET), p. 201; Vibhor Sharma, P.G., Near field communication (2013) Conference on Advances in Communication and Control Systems 2013 (CAC2S 2013), p. 343. , New Delhi, India: Atlantis Press; Muhammad Qasim Saeed, C.D., An attack on signed NFC records and some necessary revisions of NFC specifications (2012) International Journal for Information Security Research (IJISR), 2, p. 325; Ahmad, M.A., Touchin: An NFC supported attendance system in a university environment (2014) International Journal of Information and Education Technology, 4 (5), p. 449; Cavokian, A., Near field communications, keep it secure and private (2012) ISSA Journal, 13; Du, H., NFC technology: Today and tomorrow (2013) International Journal of Future Computer and Communication, 2 (4); Mohammad Awedh, A.M., Electronic attendance systems using NFC (2015) International Journal of Industrial Electronics and Electrical Engineering, 3 (9), pp. 30-32; Abhilash Bhise, R.K., Attendance system using NFC technology with embedded camera on mobile device (2015) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 4 (2), pp. 350-353; Elakiyaselvi, P., A framework for implementing e-attendance system uisng near field communication in android OS (2012) International Journal of Computer Technology & Applications, 3 (2), pp. 854-858; Kakani, V., Implementation of reliable attendence system using android and near field communication technology (2014) Global Journal of Engineering, Design, & Technology, pp. 5-10; More, V., Nayak, S., Attendance automation using near field communication (NFC) technology (2013) International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, pp. 572-575; Pampattiwar, S., Literature survey on NFC, Applications and controller (2012) International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, 3 (2)",,,,"IAEME Publication",,,,,09766340,,,,"English","Int.

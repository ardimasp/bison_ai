Recently, deep learning networks using Triplet Loss have become a common framework for person identification and verification. In this paper, we present a new method on how to select appropriate hard-negatives for training using Triplet Loss. We show that, by incorporating pairs which would otherwise have been discarded yields better accuracy and performance. We also applied Adaptive Moment Estimation algorithm to mitigate the risk of early convergence due to the additional hard-negative pairs. In LFW verification benchmark, we managed to achieve an accuracy of 0.955 and AUC of 0.989 as opposed to 0.929 and 0.973 in the original OpenFace. © 2018 The Authors.

External information such as secret messages or digital archives can be embedded into the DNA sequence by mutating its molecular sequence according to a certain algorithm. This study presents a sector-based DNA steganography method using non-coding regions of the DNA sequence as the host for carrying binary data. The aim of the sector-based embedding is to have a high level of security, data capacity, and error handling while preserving the organism's life information. A sector consists of reference bases, segmented message bases, and parity bases. The parity bases can detect and handle mutation errors in each sector. The sector length controls the data capacity and security. Our in silico experiments verified that the bit-per-nucleotide of our method can be [1.2, 2.0] by controlling the sector length, which is 0.2 point higher than that of conventional methods. As many as 104 base mutations in the DNA sequence can be handled for perfect message retrieval. Furthermore, the probability for message detection without keys is lower than 1.3949 × 10−62, which is very low. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

Our method maps the encrypted data to the DNA sequence using a numerical mapping table, before concealing it in the noncoding sequence using a secret key comprising sector length and the random number generator's seed. Our encoding algorithm is sector-based and reference dependent. Using modular arithmetic, we created a unique binary-base translation for every sector. By conducting a simulation study, we showed that our method could preserve amino acid information, extract hidden data without reference to the host DNA sequence, and detect the position of mutation error. Experimental results verified that our method produced higher data capacity than conventional methods, with a bpn (bitpernucleotide) value that ranged from approximately 1-2, depending on the selected sector length. Additionally, our novel method detected the positions of mutation errors by the presence of a parity base in each sector.

With superior capability to record information to magnetic storage, many researches are done to achieve the maturity of DNA storage and secure communication. The new data embedding method explained in this paper is designed to insert binary data into noncoding regions of DNA sequence in order to preserve its biological function. To reach a high standard of security and capacity, data is encrypted, translated, and then encoded accordingly into DNA sectors using a reference-dependent mechanism. Error correction method using Reed-Solomon encoder and parity check gives a good error handling against substitution and insertion or deletion (indel) mutations. Simulations show that proposed method has higher bit-per-nucleotide (bpn) value even it is restricted to noncoding regions only. © 2014 ACM.","capacity; dna steganography; dna storage; error correction; noncoding region","Digital storage; DNA; Error correction; Magnetic storage; Reed-Solomon codes; Steganography; Biological functions; capacity; Data embedding methods; High capacity data hiding; Non-coding region; Record information; Reed Solomon encoder; Secure communications; Gene encoding",,,,,"Brown, T.A., (2007) Genomes 3, , Garland Science Publishing, 3rd edition, New York; Wong, P.C., Wong, K.K., Foote, H., Organic data memory using the DNA approach (2003) Commun.

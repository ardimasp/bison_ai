The inputs are the amount of enemies defeated and hero taken damages. There are five levels of difficulty. The measurement of accuracy done by Mean- Squared Error, meanwhile the measurement of effectiveness done by comparing the value of Mean- Squared Error to the Artificial Neural Network's. The result is ANFIS has better performance on accuracy and effectiveness, as the value of MSE is 0.010592338 compared to 0.026847068 of ANN, so it can be conclude that ANFIS has good accuracy and effectiveness when it implemented as Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

But in reality there are still problems and obstacles in the application of these technologies. This is due to the lack of utilization of the Optimis system so that it influences the quality of the data and reports on the sales process contained in the Optimis sales force automation system. To find out the extent of the success of the system implementation of the Optimis sales force automation, an analysis of the implementation of the system was carried out Optimis sales force automation with the framework of Delon and Mclean and using the PLS-SEM (Partial Least Square) analysis method. The results of hypothesis testing that have been carried out that the variables used are information quality and service quality have a positive effect on system usage, information quality and service quality have a positive effect on user satisfaction and information quality, system usage and user satisfaction have a positive effect on net benefits. And from the statistical tests performed, the level of influence is higher in student acceptance of the system Optimis sales force automation is the quality of service to the use of the system Optimis sales force automation with a value of 3,643. While the level of influence that is lower in acceptance is the quality of the system towards user satisfaction with a value of 0.151. © 2019 Little Lion Scientific.

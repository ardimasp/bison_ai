Without exception, the development of chatbot for the hotel receptionist tasks also demands a massive training dataset. Unfortunately, laborious effort and hefty time are needed to manually collect a dataset with that size. Therefore, an information system is needed to assist the dataset collection. In regards to solve the problem, this research contributes in developing the information system that enables a massive data collection for training a hotel receptionist chatbot in a reasonable time. In detail, the contribution of this research are twofold: (1) developing a realiable crowdsourcing information system design to collect and store the dataset for training hotel receptionist chatbot; and (2) developing a user experience that can stimulate the crowdworkers to provide more data. © 2020 IEEE.","Chatbot; Crowdsourcing; Data collection; Hotel receptionist chatbot","Crowdsourcing; Deep learning; Hotels; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Metadata; User experience; Chatbot; Massive data; Peak performance; Training dataset; Data acquisition",,,,,"Adiwardana, D., (2020) Towards A Human-like Open-domain Chatbot; Zhou, L., Gao, J., Li, D., Shum, H.-Y., The design and implementation of xiaoice, an empathetic social chatbot (2020) Comput.

One of the challenges derives from either productive or receptive skills. In accordance with productive skill, this study aims to determine the forms of error in the speaking practice of international students in Bina Nusantara (BINUS) University in 2017-2018 through Online UKBIPA application. In this scope, UKBIPA represents the proficiency test of Indonesian language for international students in BINUS University. The research method is qualitative based-research with content analysis techniques. The data of this study contains the utterance of the practical speaking of international BIPA students transcribed in complete sentences. Based on the analysis of 175 sentences in the form of BIPA students' speech, the results obtained 72 phonological errors (40%), 43 lexical errors (25%), 22 semantic errors (13%), and 38 grammatical errors (22%) in student speech. The results of this study benefits for the development of BIPA materials, especially for speaking skill; the development of BIPA speaking method; development of evaluation tools and speaking tests of BIPA; and refinement of the Online UKBIPA Binus test application. The study concludes that the major error in speaking practice of BIPA appeared in phonological errors. In this sense, the study contributes to the learners and teachers in preparing BIPA learning eventually. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Linguistics errors; Online; Speaking practice; UKBIPA BINUS","E-learning; Errors; Learning systems; Semantics; Speech; Grammatical errors; Indonesian languages; International students; Online; research methods; Speaking practice; Test applications; UKBIPA BINUS; Students",,,,,"Bahri, S., Rasyid, S.F., Fenomena Kedwibahasaan di Sekolah Dasar; Sebuah Kondisi dan Bentuk Kesantunan Berbahasa (2018) Jurnal Bidang Pendidikan Dasar (JBPD), 2 (2), pp. 62-72; Ruriana, P., Nurul, I., Pamungkas, S., (2010) Interferensi Dan Integrasi Bahasa, , https://pusatbahasaalazhar.wordpress.com/hakikat-hakikikemerdekaan/interferensi-dan-integrasi/, Retrieved August 14, 2018, from; Budiarti, A., Interferensi Bahasa Indonesia Ke Dalam Bahasa Inggris Pada Abstrak Jurnal Ilmiah (2013) Bahasa Dan Seni: Jurnal Bahasa, Sastra, Seni, Dan Pengajarannya, 41 (1), pp. 10-17; Yulianto, B., Mintowati, M., (2009) Analisis Kesalahan Berbahasa, , Jakarta: Universitas Terbuka; Wood, J.F., Errors in second/foreign language learning and their interpretations (2017) Education and Linguistics Research, 3 (1), p. 1; Maharani, M., (2012) Efektivitas Pembelajaran Bahasa Indonesia Bagi Penutur Asing Untuk Meningkatkan Keterampilan Menulis, , Unpublished master's thesis).

The data gathered from participants' video polling. It was analyzed using descriptive qualitative approach. The findings showed that the best video was chosen as the video signified the quality of the video content. In addition, the participants enjoyed doing the peer assessment because of its immediate feedbacks and stimulation to produce better videos. In contrast to the benefits, the participants' experienced challenges, like confusion of assessing projects in diverse platforms.

The research project applied the combined approach of quantitative and qualitative methods, and thus depended on numerical and verbal data. The research project examined the numeric data in questionnaire format, and showed the frequency and percentages of each given statement. It also examined the verbal data in interview format, and explained the linguistic features. The quantitative results showed that the conversation patterns between the staff and foreign guests; in this case international students and teachers, could happen in two big domains of “face-to-face” and phone interactions. The qualitative results showed that the English proficiency of these staff was mostly at beginner’s level, and thus the pocket book should be designed with simple sentence structure, common vocabulary, and easy pronunciation way. If possible, all language functions presented in the book should be chosen and thought of carefully, so as to not differ too much from their local language schemata. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Academic operation staff; Language functions; Needs analysis",,,,,,"Ary, D., Jacobs, L.C., Razavieh, A., Sorensen, C., (2006) Introduction to Research in Education, , Thomson Wadsworth, USA; Cohen, L., Manion, L., (2000) Research Methods in Education, , Routledge Farmer, London; Connor, U., Upton, T., (2004) Introduction, Discourse in the Professions: Perspectives from Corpus Linguistics, pp. 1-8. , edited by U.

Although there were many evidences indicating a strong link between effective leadership and successful TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other languages) program, there was still a lack of studies of leadership into the field. This article investigated leadership practices which supported TESOL program for undergraduate EFL students at BINUS University, where English courses were compulsory and EFL students were the majority. Effective leadership practices for TESOL were highlighted, which were setting goals and objectives, allowing leaders to be pioneers, providing TESOL professional training, and facilitating TESOL program. Obstacles to these practices were also found, such as the lack of shared information network and the prevailing minor views on TESOL program, in which members were considered having the low status. The article concluded that as EFL students were growing in number in the university to meet their future targets at international contexts, the need and focus on developing leadership practices and resources to support TESOL program was inevitable. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

The research project applied the descriptive approach of quantitative method, and thus depended on numerical data. The research project examined the data under two paired scores of the same class groups. The set of scores was to compare the reading scores with the writing results. Then, the degree of correlation of the pair was tested so as to find its significance. Interpretation and explanation of data was made based on the statistical results by using correlation research analysis.

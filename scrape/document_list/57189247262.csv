The difference between Frequentist and Bayesian is the point of view in terms of looking at a parameter. Bayesian views a parameter as a random variable, it means the value is not a single value. The modeling method that most commonly used by researchers is linear regression model. The Frequentist methods that are often used in linear regression are Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). However, along with the Bayesian development, several studies have shown better modeling results than the Frequentist method. On the other hand, Bayesian approach is also used when assumptions in linear regression model using OLS are not met. Therefore, this research performs linear regression modeling with Bayesian approach. The analysis showed that linear regression model using OLS does not met all assumptions. It means the model is not good enough. Then, Bayesian approach can be used as an alternative for the model. The comparison of Bayesian and Frequentist modeling results using several criteria such as RMSE, MAPE and MAD. The results showed that the linear regression method using Bayesian approach is better than Frequentist method using OLS. © 2018 The Authors.

This study aimed to investigate in vivo anti-diabetic activities of the ethanol extract, ethyl acetate fraction and n-hexane fraction of Cassia siamea Lamk in alloxan-induced mice. The study concluded that: (1) the ethanol extract and n-hexane fraction of Cassia siamea Lamk (Juar) leaves have anti-diabetic activity in Webster albino mice induced with alloxan, (2) The extract of Cassia siamea Lamk leaves, the fractions of 500 mg ethyl acetate and 500 mg n-Hexana of Cassia siamea Lamk provided better performances in lowering blood glucose levels compared to Ethanol extracts both 500 mg and 1000 mg. In the form of ethyl acetate and n-hexane fraction at a dose of 150 mg/kg BW provided the highest anti-diabetic activity compared to the other test groups that are able to decrease blood sugar level by 10.25% and 9.98% respectively. Its effect is equivalent to glibenclamide at a dose of 0.65 mg/kg BW which can lower blood sugar levels by 9.27%. Thus Cassia siamea Lamk leaf is very potential as an alternative drug antidiabetes mellitus, and (3) the 1000 mg Ethanol extract, 150 mg Ethyl acetate and 150 mg n-Hexana had no difference effects in lowering blood glucose levels compared to the anti-diabetic chemical drug glibenclamide. © 2018 The Authors.

The model equation is called global model. But if the data is a spatial data, where the differences of locations affect the model, then global model is no longer relevant. One of method can be used to analysis for spatial data is Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). GWR is local model that represents model for each location. DKI Jakarta is a province with the highest human development index value in Indonesia. The HDI value is calculated based on some basic components of quality of life. In this paper, we analyze the HDI using multiple linear regression and we get a global model. But because DKI Jakarta consists of some regions with different condition, then we also used spatial data analysis methods. Then we apply GWR method to analyze the HDI in Jakarta. On the GWR model acquired local models for each location. We compared two models of global and local, the results showed that the factors that affect HDI in every region at DKI Jakarta are different. Based on the analysis by linear regression and GWR, the results show that the SSE of GWR model is smaller than linear regression model. So the GWR model is better than linear regression model. © 2016 Author(s).",,,,,,,"(2012) Ind. Pem. Man.

Propagation of rodent tuber is hard to be achieved by using conventional methods. The purpose of this research is to optimize method and media for propagating rodent tuber through initiation, induction, multiplication, and acclimatization. Rodent tuber was obtained from Pekalongan, Indonesia. In vitro rodent tuber plantlets were induced through direct single node culture of tuber. Shoot induction was achieved on MS 1 mgL-1 2,4-D combined with 0.3 mgL-1 BAP and 1 mgL-1 NAA combined with 0.5 mgL-1. Induced shoots were initiated on MS media supplemented with (1, 0.5, 1.5 mgL-1) NAA and (1, 0.5, 0.5 mgL-1) BAP. Shoots were then multiplicated on MS media supplemented with (0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5 mgL-1) NAA and 0.5 mgL-1 BAP to investigate the effect of NAA concentrations on shoot proliferation. Plantlets were acclimatizated on husk and compost (1:1) media and post-acclimatizated on husk, soil, and compost (1:1:1) media. The highest percentage of viable induced explants (66.67%) was obtained on MS 1 mgL-1 2,4-D and 0.3 mgL-1 BAP. The maximum number of shoots obtained in the initiation stage (14 shoots) was achieved on MS media supplemented with 0.5 mgL-1 NAA and 0.5 mgL-1 BAP. The maximum number of shoots obtained in the multiplication stage (8.2 ± 3.19) was achieved on MS media supplemented with 0.5 mgL-1 NAA and 0.5 mgL-1 BAP. The survival rate of rodent tuber during acclimatization period was 100% and during post-acclimatization period was 58%. Rodent tuber has been successfully multiplicated through direct organogenesis in vitro. © 2015 IEEE.","acclimatization; in vitro organogenesis; Indonesian clone; Typhonium flagelliforme Lodd","Composting; Environmental management; Information science; Plants (botany); acclimatization; Anticancer activities; Conventional methods; In-vitro; Medicinal herb; Shoot induction; Shoot proliferation; Typhonium flagelliforme Lodd; Tubes (components)",,,,,"Surachman, D., Penggunaan beberapa taraf konsentrasi paklobutrazol dalam media konservasi keladi tikus (Typhonium flagelliforme Lodd.) in vitro (2009) Buletin Teknik Pertanian, 14 (1), pp. 31-33; Lai, C.S., Mas, R.H.M.H., Naik, N.K., Majid, M.I.A., Mansor, S.M., Navaratnam, V., Typhonium flagelliforme inhibits cancer cell growth in vitro and induces apoptosis: An evaluation by the bioactivity guided approach (2008) Journal of Ethnopathology, 118, pp. 14-20; Essai, (1986) Medicinal Herbs Index in Indonesia, , Jakarta: PT Essai Indonesia; Mohan, S., Abdul, A.B., Wahab, S.I.A., Al-Zubairi, A.S., Elhasan, M.M., Yousif, M., Antibacterial and antioxidant activities of Typhonium flagelliforme (Lodd.) blume tube (2008) Journal of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, 4 (4), pp. 402-407; Chan, L.K., Koh, W.Y., Tengku-Muhammad, S., Comparison of Cytotoxic Activities between in vitro and Field Grown Plants of Typhonium flagelliforme (Lodd.)

The method used in this study is quantitative research methods and the type of research is descriptive research. The data collection method using observations and interviews, and the data characteristic are primary and secondary data. Time Horizon in this study using a cross-sectional. Data analysis used ABC Class-Based and Linear Programming method with LINGO Software version 18.0. The results of research conducted at PT Aerofood ACS warehouse is product classification using ABC Class-Based. The products are divided into three classes, class A namely rice, and monouse, class B are soy sauce & sauce, coconut milk, and milk, and class C are tissue, sugar, and tea. For product placement allocation using Transportation method with Linear Programming approach. The results obtained are changes in the space used to store all products. The smaller overall number of pallets and shelves that should visit affects the length of time taken to collect the products. Based on these results, managers should use the ABC Class-Based and Transportation methods for optimizing allocations at a catering services company. © 2019 IEEE.","ABC class-based; linear programming; warehouse; warehouse layout","Information management; Linear programming; Warehouses; Allocation optimization; Class-based; Data characteristics; Data collection method; Product classification; Quantitative research methods; Transportation method; Warehouse layout; C (programming language)",,,,,"Badan Pusat Statistik, Statistik Indonesia 2018, , https://www.bps.go.id/publication/2018/07/03/5a963c1ea9b0fed6497d0845/statistik-Indonesia-2018.html, Accessed on October 2nd from web; Tippayawong, K.Y., Sopadang, A., Patitad, P., Improving warehouse layout design of a chicken slaughterhouse using combined ABC class based and optimized allocation techniques (2013) Proceedings of the World Congress on Engineering, 1. , November; Khan, S.A.R., Dong, Q.L., Yu, Z., Role of abc analysis in the process of efficient order fulfillment: Case study (2017) Advanced Engineering Forum, 23, pp. 114-121. , Trans Tech Publications; Heizer, J., Render, B., Munson, C., (2017) Operations Management: Sustainability and Supply Chain Management, , 12/e, Harlow: Pearson Education; Reid, R.D., Sanders, N.R., (2017) Operations Management: An Integrated Approach, , Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons; Taylor, B.W., III, (2015) Introduction to Management Science, , 12th edition, Harlow: Pearson Education; Horta, M., Coelho, F., Relvas, S., Layout design modelling for a real world just-in-time warehouse (2016) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 101, pp. 1-9. , November; Arnaout, J.P., ElKhoury, C., Karayaz, G., Solving the multiple level warehouse layout problem using ant colony optimization (2017) Operational Research, pp. 1-18. , July; Mourtzis, D., Samothrakis, V., Zogopoulos, V., Vlachou, E., Warehouse design and operation using augmented reality technology: A papermaking industry case study (2019) Procedia CIRP, 79, pp. 574-579. , January",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","4th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2019","19 August 2019 through 20 August 2019",,152147,,9781728133331,,,"English","Proc.

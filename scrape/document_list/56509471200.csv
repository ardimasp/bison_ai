Development and design was done by collecting data using questionnaires to the respondents. Design method using observations, distributing questionnaires and to study literature, and then after that do the design in hardware (microcontroller) made United Modeling Language (UML), database design, code implementation and creation of user interfaces on IOS and Android. The result of this research is the implementation of a remote home automation application in mobile which can help users in order to control the home and determine the cost of electricity that has been used in every electronic device so that the optimization can be achieved. © 2015 SERSC.","Arduino; Automation; Home remote system; Microcontroller","Controllers; Design; Microcontrollers; Modeling languages; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Surveys; Thermoelectric equipment; User interfaces; Arduino; Automation systems; Control electronics; Cost of electricity; Database design; Electronic device; Remote systems; United modeling language; Automation",,,,,"Kim, J.A., Choi, M.K., Robles, R.J., Cho, E.S., Kim, T.H., A Review on Security in Smart Home Development (2010) Journal of Security Engineering, 2; Piyare, R., Tazil, M., Bluetooth based home automation system using cell phone (2011), pp. 192-195. , Consumer Electronics (ISCE), 2011 IEEE 15th International Symposium; ElShafee, A., Hamed, K.A., Design and Implementation of WiFi Based Home Automation System (2012) World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, 68; Sanaullah, H., Sarower, Hassan, M., Development of a Cell Phone Based Remote System: An Effective Switching System for Controlling Home and Office Appliances (2009) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Science IJCECS, 9 (10); Wahab, A., Abdullah, N., Johari, A., Kadir, Herdawatie, A., GSM Based Elecctrical Control System for Smart Home Application (2010) Journal of Convergence Information Technology, 5 (1); Goodwin, S., Smart Home Automation with Linux: Apress (2010); Fling, B., Mobile Design and Development: Practical concepts and techniques for creating mobile sites and web apps (2009) O'Reilly Media; Lee, W.M., Beginning Android Application Development (2011), Indiana: Wiley Publishing",,,,"Science and Engineering Research Support Society",,,,,19754094,,,,"English","Int.

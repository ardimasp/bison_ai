Cloud computing can facilitate controlled distribution of blood by using an information system. The problems that occurs in the distributions of blood at the hospitals in Indonesia are sometimes the distributions are not controlled, so the blood may run out of stock caused by inequality of blood needs, difficulty in finding blood donors, and don't have an integrated system. The purpose of this study is to propose a connecting system that integrates Indonesian society who can be personal donor to help blood supply availability of UTD PMI using BBIS (Blood Bank Management System) based on cloud computing. The research methodology is collecting data with a systematic literature review and referring to previous studies, related to the current conditions in Indonesia. The result in this study is to propose Blood Bank Information System (BBIS), featured of application, dashboard, module and network architecture. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Since variety of travel services may come from different departments and same type of the travel services may have several providers. This paper proposed for combining any various travel service in one application including travel reservation services and give an additional features. How to integrate these services from different departments for travelers to provide ease of use cross platform and travel services has become an important in Smart Travel System (STS). ESB is the primary function to exchange the transformation of protocol, message or data. According to the ESB, STS is a way to provide the travel services that can give an experience for travelers in reservation any travel services from any devices in one application. This paper is proposed to answer about the problem of travel service providers in Indonesia, which have many features in one application that can be used from various platforms. These features consist of travel packages, booking airline tickets, buses, trains, hotel reservations, tour guides, looking for nearby attractions, car motorcycle rentals, and souvenirs. © 2018 IEEE.","ESB; Service Oriented Architecture (SOA); Smart Travel System; Travel Services","Architecture; Computer architecture; Information services; Metadata; Pattern recognition; Reservation systems; Airline tickets; Business goals; Cross-platform; Primary functions; Smart Travel System; Travel packages; Travel reservation service; Travel services; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,"Kemenpar, (2016) Laporan Akuntabilitas Kinerja Kementrian Pariwisata Tahun, , 2016; Perkembangan Usaha Jasa Perjalanan Wisata Berskala Menengah Dan Besar, Tahun 2007-2011, , http://www.kemenpar.go.id, BPS Statistik Jasa Perjalanan Wisata Taken back from; Wang, D., Research on design and realization of SOA-based tourism e-commerce system (2017) Revista de la Facultad de Ingeniería U.C.V., 32 (13), pp. 732-736; Choi, S.-Y., Lee, H.-C., Jin, H.-J., Design of the travel agency system based on service oriented architecture for business models (ICCAS 2008) (2008) International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems; Newcomer, E., Lomow, G., (2006) Understanding SOA with Web Service, , Addison-Wesley, New York; Arsanjani, A., Service-oriented modeling and architecture (2004) IBM Developer Works, 1, p. 15; Navabpour, S., Ghoraie, L.S., Malayeri, A.A., Chen, J., Lu, J., An intelligent traveling service based on SOA (2008) 2008 IEEE Congress on Services 2008-Part I, pp. 191-198. , July IEEE; Hung, J.C., The smart-travel system: Utilising cloud services to aid traveller with personalised requirement (2012) International Journal of Web and Grid Services, 8 (3), pp. 279-303; Hung, J.C., Hsu, V., Wang, Y.-B., A smart-travel system based on social network services for cloud environment (2011) Third International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems; Implementation of Service-Oriented Architecture with Web Service for Academic Information Application; Thomas, E., (2006) Service-Oriented Architecture Concept Technology and Design, , acorn Korea; Jhingran, A., Enterprise information mashups: Integrating information, simply (2006) VLDB '06: Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, pp. 3-4. , VLDB Endowment; Dadape, N., Jadhav, J.R., Gaidhani, B.R., Vyavahare, P.Y., Achaliya Parag, S.U., Smart travel guide: Application for android mobile (2012) International Conference on Recent Trends in Engineering & Technology, Special Issue of International Journal of Electronics, Communication & Soft Computing Science & Engineering; Al-Omari, A.H., Al-Marghirani, A., (2017) Smart Tourism Architectural Model (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: A Case Study) (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 8 (10). , 2017; (2017) Book Autonomous Smart Travel Ecosystem V. 3.1.0, , September 17; Andress, M., The road to secure web services (2002) InfoWorld, 24 (2), p. 52; Fajar, A.N., Legowo, N., Services modeling based on SOA and BPM for information system flexibility improvement (2018) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering., 8 (4), pp. 2451-2455; Palavinel, K., Kuppuswami, S., Architecture solutions to e-learning systems using service-oriented cloud computing reference architecture (2014) IJIAEM., 3 (3), pp. 547-559; Zimmermann, O., Krogdahl, P., Gee, C., Elements of service-oriented analysis and design (2004) IBM Developerworks; Arsanjani, A., How to identify, specify, and realize services for your SOA (2005) IBM Corporation, February; Juric, M.B., Loganathan, R., Sarang, P., Jennings, F., (2007) SOA Approach to Integration; Andary, J.F., Sage, A.P., The role of service oriented architectures in systems engineering (2010) Information Knowledge Systems Management, 9 (1), pp. 47-74; Zhai, Y., Zhang, J., Lin, K.J., SOA middleware support for service process reconfiguration with end-to-end QoS constraints (2009) Web Services, 2009.

Nutricell Pacific is a private feed additive manufacturing industry located in Tangerang, where they implement barcode system in their production department for 10 months. They applied QR code as their products information storage. The main goal of this research is to evaluate the barcode system from the system perspective in the aspect of efficiency and effectiveness, identify the valid factors which affect the overall performance and find alternative solutions. Without official overall audits, the company could not detect the possible issue or technical improvements required. Hence, by using DeLone and McLean success model variables and system evaluation theory as the qualitative approach could find the potential elements and determine the current efficiency and effectiveness. Based on hypothesis testing, interviews and 15 respondent questionnaires, the findings of this research will reveal the factors which affect the worker’s performance in interacting with barcode system. The possible factors consist of system quality, information quality, user satisfaction and organization impact. Accordingly, through the methodology applied, the results certainly show the efficiency and effectiveness according to the workers and systems interaction lenses and not from the technical perspectives.

This program is planned, implemented, directed and supervised by the government so that the program's objectives are in line with the targets, namely poverty reduction. Many efforts have been made but the impact of this program has not been optimal, one of the reasons is the unavailability of object target data for these programs that state who the poor are and where they live for the basis of program intervention so that implementation is not on target as well as the realization report. The purpose of this paper is to design a Business Intelligence (BI) application that is able to provide such data so that program interventions are in line with the objectives. Development methodology is designed using Geographical Information System (GIS) approach yang which consists of stages of data acquisition (spatial and tabular data) at various levels of administration, geodatabase design and WebGIS applications as well as spatial analysis.

Education, health, and food are the three main points of concern to the government, besides unemployment, business opportunities, infrastructures, and village economics. The target is villagers and their communities. Today there are mainly three interventions of village development programs in education (Indonesia Smart Card), health (Indonesia Health Card) and food (Household Food Program) that supported by macro data only. Data on the number of villagers requiring education, health, food and data of village potential resources are available, but who and where they are cannot be known. Furthermore, at the village level, there is no such decision-making tools and no data that specifically refer to the object so that program interventions are often not targeted. The purpose of this paper is to design a database and application of village Business Intelligence (BI) by utilizing the GIS advantage to assist village officials and other government officials for decision making processes in the intervention of village community welfare development program. The methods used are literature studies of village legislation, surveys, and interviews. The result of this research is the design of dashboard including database and applications. © 2018 IEEE.","business intelligence; development; GIS; intervention; program; social welfare; village","Application programs; Competitive intelligence; Decision making; Geographic information systems; Health; Information analysis; Information management; Macros; Smart cards; development; intervention; program; Social welfare; village; Rural areas",,,,,,"Sharda, R., Delen, D., Turban, E., (2014) Business Intelligence and Analytics, System for Decision Support, , 10ed Pearson Edition Limited, ISBN 10: 1-292-00920-9; Elena, C., Business intelligence (2013) Journal of Knowledge Management, Economics and Information Technology, Titu Maiorescu University, Romania; Marakash, G.M., O'Brien, J.A., Introduction to information system (2013) McGraw-Hill Irwin, , 6th, ISBN: 978-0-01-131804-4; Jinpong, P., Jaroensutansinee, M., Jaroensutansinee, K., Business intelligence and its application in the public healthcare system (2011) Center of Excellent for Ecoinformatics, School of Science, WalailakUniversity, Nakhon Si Thammarat 80161, Thailand; Kodge, B.G., Hiremath, P.S., Web-based geo-spatial and village level information extraction system using foss (2012) Journal of Advances in Information Technology, 3 (4). , November; Parmanto, B., Spatial and multidimensional visualization of Indonesia's village health statistics (2008) International Journal of Health Geographics, 7, 30; Huisman, O.R.A., Principles geographic information system (2009) ITC Publisher, , ISBN-13 9789061642695; Monwar Alam, B., Application of geographic information systems (2012) InTech Publisher, , BN-13 9789535108245; Campbell, J., Shin, M., Essentials of geographic information systems (2011) Publisher: Flat World Knowledge, , BN-13 9781453321973; Shivpuje, P.R., Parmeshwar, V.P., Deshmukh, N.K., Application of Geoinformatics for Smart Village Creation (2017) International Journal of Computational Intelligence Research, 13 (5), pp. 1073-1081; Aronoff, S., Geographic information systems: A management perspective (1989) John Wiley, and Son; Owen, P., Hall, Using dashboard based (2003) Siness Intelligence Systems: An Approach to Improve Business Performance Graziadio Business Review; Verbert, K., Duval, E., Klerkx, J., Learning analytics dashboard applications (2013) American Behaveiuors Scientist (ABS); (2014) Indonesia Law of the Republic of Indonesia 6 the Year, , About Villages; (2005) Government Regulation, (72). , The year About Village; (2007) Regulation of the Minister of Home Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, , 12 The year About Villages; Regulation of the minister of village, development of underdeveloped regions, and transmigration of the republic of Indonesia (2017) On Determination of Priority of Village Fund Usage Year 2018 19 the Year; Regulation of the minister of home affairs of the republic of Indonesia 74 of the year (2015) The Procedure for Changing the Element of Population Data in Electronic Identity Cards; Regulation of the minister of home affairs of the republic of Indonesia 81 of the year (2015) Evaluation of Village Development; (2015) Decree of the Minister of Home Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia 12 of the Year the Implementation of Village Governments; (2015) Regulation of the Minister of Home Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia 39 of the Year the Code and Data of Regional Government Administration; Regulation of the minister of home Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia 5 of the year (2007) Guidelines for Regulating Community Institutions; Regional Profile Information System, the Minister of Home Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia Website, , http://www.sipd.go.id; National Policy Database System, State Secretariat of the Republic of Indonesia.

At the provincial level, almost all tourism business actors such as hotels, tourist destinations, and tourism travel bureaus, have websites to support promotional activities and marketing of tourism products. The website was developed for the purpose of disseminating information on Indonesian tourism products and attracting tourists as much as possible to visit tourism destinations. Currently tourism websites are generally built apart from each other so that sometimes inform the same tourism products but not complete and not support each other. Nevertheless the existence of the website has not been optimal in boosting the increase in the number of tourists visiting Indonesia, even when compared with neighboring countries the number of foreign tourists who come to Indonesia is still relatively low. The current information technology enables collaboration between websites so as to increase the chance of tourism information access for potential tourists both at home and abroad and impact on the increase of tourist visit. This paper aims to see the potential use of web and data communications technologies currently available to enhance the promotion and promotion of digital tourism. The method used is literature study, document study of tourism legislation and field survey to study the potential utilization of information and communication technology relevant to collaboration model and its implementation. The expected result is the recommendation of the strategy of tourism websites development and their implementation of collaboration at the provincial level so as to have an impact on the increasing number of tourists visiting the province. © IAEME Publication","Collaboration; Marketing; Promotion; Province; Tourism; Website",,,,,"039A/VR

Tourist visits from year to year have increased, but still below the number of countries in Southeast Asia. Under these conditions, the government, especially the tourism office needs to conduct a collaboration to maintain and increase the growth of the number of tourists visiting Indonesia. This study aims to integrate information services from other parties who collaborate to support tourism activities, especially collaboration at the provincial level. Related parties are the Tourism office, hotel, Travel & Tourism Agent and Tourism Destination. The integration of information is intended to facilitate access to information by tourists in accordance with their needs. Observation, literature study and information system integration design were used in this study. Observations were conducted at the tourism office and tourism destination in three different locations to obtain the needed information in Semarang, Surabaya and Yogyakarta. UML Modeling is used for system analysis and development. A prototype of information integration is generated, which can be used to integrate information between tourism office, hotel, Travel & Tourism Agent and tourism destination. With the Integration of such information each party will obtain a marketing benefit, income and other benefits economically. © 2017 IEEE.","information; integration; json; tourism; Web services","Information management; Information services; Integration; Websites; information; Information integration; Information system integration; json; Literature studies; Southeast Asia; tourism; Tourism activities; Web services",,,,,,"(2017) Perkembangan Pariwisata Dan Transportasi Nasional Maret 2017, , https://www.bps.go.id/website/brs_ind/brsInd-20170502115528.pdf, Badan Pusat Statistik, Mei; Adi, S., A collaborative tourism websites to support electronic promotion and marketing by using enterprise service bus (ESB (2016) Adv.

From some of the literature mentioned that manage big data can create significant value for the world economy, improving productivity and competitiveness of enterprises and the public sector as well as creating a large economic surplus for consumers. However, from some of the information obtained, big data is still not widely applied in the company or organization. This study aimed to explore more information about the big data and proceed with making an application prototype big data management. To experiment with big data storage that is database, this research use NoSQL database technology that can map the needs of both structured and unstructured. And this research will be carried out migration of Relational Database (RDBMS) into the database MongoDB. Prototype will be create with the object of study is structured and unstructured data. The expected result of this research is a model or prototype of big data management that can help organizations and companies (especially education) to make decisions based on various types of data. © 2015, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

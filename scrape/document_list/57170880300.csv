And any changes that occur not infrequently be a significant problem in construction projects, especially at the time of its execution performance. Given this research, the reader can find out how much the relationship / linkages between items redesigning at the time of execution of the execution time. The data used in this study are primary data and secondary data. Primary data were collected through questionnaires distributed to the project manager, while the secondary data obtained from the study of literature relating to the existing problems. The data has been collected, then analyzed using correlation and inter-correlation analysis, factor analysis, analysis of decision variables, and regression analysis model and testing validation test to obtain an appropriate regression model. From these results several conclusions can be drawn as follows, among others, the independent variable determinant of design changes that occurred during the implementation phase has a negative correlation to the performance of a construction project which changes the electrical installation work, changes to excavation and backfilling, changes to the finishing work interior, and changes to the ancillary buildings such as fence construction time significantly affect performance. © 2017 Author(s).",,,,,,,"Assaf, S.A., Heiji, S.A.-S., (2006) International Journal of Project Management, 24 (4), pp. 349-357; Barrie, S.B., Poulson, B.C., (1992) Management.

This road connects the westernmost side to the easternmost side region of the islands. From year to year, the condition of the road is always damaged, partly because of unstable base layer, which is consisted of clay with elastic properties, rain puddles, vehicle load which exceeds the capacity, and the volume of vehicles that reach 45, 000 vehicles per day. For maintenance purpose, it is always incurred costs to repair the roads which are constantly increasing in number every year. In 2013, the budget for repairs reached 1.28 trillion (IDR), in 2014 increased to approximately 1.8 trillion (IDR), an increase of approximately 38%. In practice, performance-based contract method had been tried for road maintenance in addition to the traditional method of a contract, beside of the technical aspects approach. It was taken to ensure that such damage will not happen again. But until now, the damage is still going on and returned. Therefore, it is necessary to study on the implementation of the contract method of repair work that has been done so far, and it also needs to study the alternative solutions with a strategic approach, in addition to pay attention to the technical and juridical aspects. The purpose of writing this paper is to examine the factors causing damage to roads; the effective method of road maintenance contracts that could be implemented, i.e. between traditional contract method and the method of performance-based contracts; and to produce an alternative strategic decision that is an effective way of managing Pantura lane road in order to minimize the damage which usually happens every years. The conclusion is that a holistic view is needed to make sure all necessary, interrelated aspects are covered and dealt with. It must be much more than just an action plan to reach a single goal. © 2015 The Authors.

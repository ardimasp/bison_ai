However, there is still little effort to address the adoption of CRM in the field of oil and gas government agencies, mainly related to the office facilities management area. This paper seeks to fill this gap by discussing the implications of CRM in the office facility management and its implementation in the upstream oil and gas agency in the Republic of Indonesia. The study recommends a CRM strategy implemented on each element of people, process, and technology. This implementation is expected to provide office facility services that are more effective and efficient, also to increase customer satisfaction and employee productivity. The evaluation of CRM software, the selection of cloud computing solutions, as well as the use of a balanced scorecard to measure project performance, are also presented in the paper. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Cloud computing offers several potential benefits that many e- governments over the world are trying to obtain by adopting cloud solutions into their architecture and public services. This paper focuses on designing GEA using TOGAF ADM based on the G-cloud model. The conceptual relationship between cloud computing in government agencies and information architecture is provided to provide a better picture in the implementation of GEA. A mapping model for G-cloud implementation is presented, as well as services provided by the G-Vendor cloud to describe the objectives and potential requirements for conceptualization processes. The proposed framework is expected to increase the success rate of e-government implementation in Indonesia, which has declined significantly over the last 8 years. However, that does not rule out the possibility of being implemented in other countries so that e-government can provide the promised benefits to their citizens. © 2019 IJSTR.","E-government; Enterprise architecture; Government cloud (g-cloud); Government enterprise architecture; Indonesia; TOGAF",,,,,,,"Setiawan, A., Yulianto, E., E-Government Interoperability and Integration Architecture Modeling Using TOGAF Framework Based On Service Oriented Architecture (2018) The Asian Journal of Technology Management, 11 (1), pp. 26-45; Saha, P., (2010) Enterprise architecture as platform for connected government: Understanding the impact of enterprise architecture on connected government, , National University of Singapore Institute of Systems Science; Budiardjo, E.K., Firmansyah, G., Hasibuan, Z.A., Weighted Components of i-Government Enterprise Architecture (2017) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 801 (1), p. 12025; Saiya, A.A., Arman, A.A., Indonesian Enterprise Architecture Framework: A Platform for Integrated and Connected Government (2018) 2018 International Conference on ICT for Smart Society (ICISS), pp. 1-6; (2016) United Nations E-Government Survey 2016: E-Government in Support of Sustainable Development, , United Nations; Firmansyah, G., Hasibuan, Z.A., Sucahyo, Y.G., Indonesia e-Government components: A principal component analysis approach (2014) 2014 International Conference on Information Technology Systems and Innovation (ICITSI), pp. 148-152; (2003) Presidential Directive No. 3/2003 about National Policy and Strategy for e-Government Development, , Indonesian Republic Cabinet Secretariat.

However, there has been no standardize framework that support the need while aligning with business strategy. This study focuses on designing architecture framework that can help government agencies in adopting cloud solution based on ROCCA and TOGAF 9.2. Both of them are well known used for cloud adoption initiatives and architecture work, especially for organizations who are actively transforming themselves. We mapped ROCCA and TOGAF 9.2 processes to provide baseline requirements of cloud adoption. Then, validate the proposed framework with implementation and evaluation in case study for The Special Task Force of Upstream Oil and Gas Activities (SKK Migas).

However, a smartwatch as an extension of a smartphone experienced a different thing. This study aims to investigate the relationship between usability, brands, and prices towards the perspective of consumers in Indonesia on smartwatches. We surveyed 116 smartwatch users and interviewed ten of them to get a complete understanding of their perceptions. This study reveals that the usage of smartwatches is less significant in influencing consumer perceptions, while brands and prices are strongly influencing the perception of consumers who have used smartwatches. Besides, this study also revealed that most respondents chose the smartwatch brand based on its smartphone brand. Xiaomi smartwatches were more affordable than other brands. Following Apple and Samsung, which ensured that they still have a safe place in the hearth of Indonesian customers. © 2019 The Authors.","Brand; Indonesia; Pricing; Smartwatch; Usability","Costs; Information systems; Information use; Smartphones; Brand; Consumer perception; Daily lives; Indonesia; Smartwatch; Usability; Usability studies; Users' perception; Wearable computers",,,,,,"Castillejo, P., Martínez, J.-F., López, L., Rubio, G., An internet of things approach for managing smart services provided by wearable devices (2013) International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks, 9 (2), pp. 1-9; Mann, S., Wearable computing: A first step toward personal imaging (1997) Computer, 30 (2), pp. 25-32; Jung, Y., Kim, S., Choi, B., Consumer valuation of the wearables: The case of smartwatches (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, 63, pp. 899-905; Choi, J., Kim, S., Is the smartwatch an IT product or a fashion product ?

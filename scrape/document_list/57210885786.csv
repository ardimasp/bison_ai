As of today, 383 of Regional Government Water Supply Companies in Indonesia, known as Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum (PDAM), are underperforming with only 36% of urban service coverage or 22,40% of national service coverage in average. This paper aims at examining the effect of the latent variables of strategic entrepreneurship, dynamic capabilities, and government policies to PDAM performance. The novelty of this research is the role of government policy as a moderating variable in the relationship between strategic entrepreneurship and dynamic capabilities as they relate to PDAM performance. The methodology used in this research is the quantitative method conducted through a descriptive and explanatory survey. The number of the sample is 120 respondents. Further data were analyzed using the SEM-PLS method with SmartPLS software. This research proved that dynamic capabilities influence PDAM performance, and indicate the need for a stronger government policy, one that would influence strategic entrepreneurship and dynamic capabilities relate to PDAM performance. These findings are intended to contribute to development of strategic management theory and a managerial implication, specifically that PDAM should apply strategic management for the improvement of their performance in order to actively participate in government programs for drinking water services. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

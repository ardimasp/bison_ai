Promedika Sejahtera (PPS). PT Promedika Sejahtera is a company engaged in the laboratory equipment industry, that need its strategic touch on its Strategic Laboratory Equipment. Products sold by the company are Oxygen, Medical Equipment, Ultraviolet System, Activated Carbon Filter, Pempers, and Underpad. Products that exist in the company are not in their own production in the production from abroad. PT Promedika Sejahtera merely sell the laboratory equipment. Yet, the company has various types of consumers namely hospitals, hospital cooperatives, pharmacies, factories, and water equipment RO shops. In this paper, strategic laboratory equipment industry refers specifically to inventory within the supply chain management perspectives. This paper constitutes collaboration with other papers on Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), Re-Order Point (ROP), and Safety Stock (SS), that convolutes Forecasting, ABC Analysis, and Partial Least Square (PLS). Yet, this paper refers to its focus merely on Forecasting, Demand Pattern, Exponential Smoothing and EOQ. As part of conclusion, this paper conveys several highlighted remarks. Those remarks refer to ABC Analysis. The grouping of goods using ABC Analysis Method is divided into three groups: A with 80% priority, group B with 20% priority and group C with 10% priority. The number of goods in group A is 12 items, group B 18 item type and group C are 30 items of goods. Forecasting demand required by the Company for 2018 based on priority group A can be done using the Double Exponential Smoothing (Holt's) Method because the pattern pattern possessed from the previous year's sales data has no seasonal but has a random trend. The results of these calculations can be seen from the table of existing research results. Ultimately, Future research is deemed indispensable within novelty purpose for the industrial system sustainability within Strategic Laboratory Equipment Industry. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Inventory; Partial Least Square; Strategic Laboratory Equipment; Supply Chain; Sustainability","Activated carbon; Economic analysis; Forecasting; Hospitals; Industrial research; Information dissemination; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Activated carbon filters; Economic order quantity; Exponential smoothing; Forecasting demand; Industrial systems; Inventory; Laboratory equipments; Partial least square (PLS); Laboratories",,,,,"Kolassa, S., Retail analytics: Integrated forecasting and inventory management for perishable products in retailing (2015) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 66 (12), pp. 2103-2104; Nahmias, S., Olsen, T.L., (2015) Production and Operations Analysis; McLaughlin, D.B., Olson, J.R., (2008) Healthcare Operations Management, 4; Sunil, C., Peter, M., (2013) Supply Chain Management: Strategy, Planning, and Operation, 5; Sarjono, H., Kuncoro, E.A., Analisis Perbandingan Perhitungan Re-Order Point (2014) Binus Business Review, 5 (1), pp. 288-300; Shandyastini, N.M., Novianti, K.D.P., ANALISIS E-LEARNING STMIK STIKOM BALI MENGGUNAKAN TECHONOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL (2016) Jurnal TeknoIf, 4; Shukla, H.S., Tripathi, R.P., Sang, N., EOQ Model with Stock-Level Dependent Demand and Different Holding Cost Functions (2017) International Journal of Operations Research and Information Systems (IJORIS), 8 (4), pp. 59-75; Yanti, T.H., Farida, Y., Analisis ABC dalam Perencanaan Obat Antibiotik di Rumah Sakit Ortopedi Surakarta (2016) JPSCR: Journal of Pharmaceutical Science and Clinical Research, 1, pp. 51-57","Nugroho Soebandrija, K.E.; Industrial Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: knugroho@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The lean concept aims to reduce costs and to increase the effectiveness of the supply chain. While the green concept tries to ensure that the ongoing process keeps bringing good effect on the environment. In designing the performance measurement of the sustainable supply chain through the lean & green supply chain management approach, this study includes a formulation for Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and grouping of the lean and green indicators which are integrated with the balanced scorecard (BSC) perspectives. It obtained 28 KPIs which consists of 15 lean supply chain KPIs and 13 green supply chain KPIs. Based on overall weighting, the highest priority KPI is the company's total revenue and total operating costs, followed by the total cost of the supply chain (all of them are from a financial perspective). The weights of three KPIs are 0.103, 0.078 and 0.072 respectively. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","BSC; green; lean; palm oil; SCM; sustainable","Benchmarking; Costs; Operating costs; Palm oil; Balanced scorecards; green; Green supply chain management; Key performance indicators; lean; Performance measurements; sustainable; Sustainable supply chains; Supply chain management",,,,,"McDonald, G., Rahmanulloh, A., Indonesia Oilseeds and Products Annual (2018) 2018 USDA Foreign Agricultural Service; Afriyanti, D., Kroeze, C., Saad, A., Indonesia palm oil production without deforestation and peat conversion by 2050 (2016) Science of the Total Environment, 557-558, pp. 562-570; Lam, W.Y., Kulak, M., Sim, S., King, H., Ma, H., Chaplin-Kramer, R., Greenhouse gas footprints of palm oil production in Indonesia over space and time (2019) Science of the Total Environment, 688, pp. 827-837; Jelsma, I., Slingerland, M., Giller, K.E., Bijman, J., Collective action in a smallholder oil palm production system in Indonesia: The key to sustainable and inclusive smallholder palm oil?

The primary theory for this paper elaborates the sources of dynamism in dynamic capability. This paper provides a multi-level theory ofdynamic capabilities (DCs) that explains resource dynamicsby conveying a primary role to persons and interpersonal interactions in lieu of abstract, which is company-level entities.This paper describes banking industry in term of dynamic capabilities to navigate change whenemployees are connected. The mentioned connection is bridged through high-quality relationships, empowering innovative aspects. Strategic adaptation is feasible when people are provided the opportunity to act, think, and feel creatively. Eventually that performance envisions opportunities to enhance how the company operates. Precisely, this paper depicts situation on PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is capitalized to proceed to data processing. The objective of this paper is to enhance the ways how the company operates in dynamic capability through disruptive innovation toward sustainable industrial system. The dynamism of dynamic capability is believed to provide adequate foundations toward disruptive innovation. Quantitative approach constitutes the research methodology through the usage of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) Ishikawa method. To conclude, by AHP Method and Ishikawa, PT. WijayaKarya is the chosen contractor that has superior value of 49%, among contractors. Ultimately, Ishikawa method conveys its criteria of quality, time, cost, and personal that require minimum 60% service level. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Contractors; Data handling; Hierarchical systems; Industry 4.0; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Disruptive innovations; Dynamic capabilities; Quantitative approach; Research methodologies; State owned enterprise; Strategic adaptations; Structural equation modelling (SEM); Enterprise resource management",,,,,"Foss, N.J., Heimericks, K.H., Winter, S.G., Zollo, M., A Hegelian dialogue toward micro-foundations of organizational perspective of its routines and capabilities (2012) European Management Review, 9 (4), pp. 173-197; Drnevich, P.L., Kriauciunas, A.P., Clarifying the conditions and limits of the contributions. the perspectives of ordinary and dynamic capabilities toward firm performance (2011) Strategic Management Journal, 32 (3), pp. 254-279; Helfat, C.E., Peteraf, M.A., Managerial cognitive capabilities and the microfoundations of dynamic capabilities (2015) Strategic Management Journal, 36 (6), pp. 831-1010. , 997-1010; International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 13, pp. 166-176; Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., (1982) An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change, , (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press); Christensen, C., (1997) The Innovator's Dilemma, , (Boston: Harvard Business School Press); Yu, D., Hang, C.C., A reflective review of disruptive innovation theory (2010) International Journal of Management Review, 12 (4), p. 435; Dubey, R., Gunasekaran, A., Papadopoulos, T., Childe, S.J., Shibin, K.T., Wamba, S.F., Sustainable supply chain management: Framework and further research directions (2016) Journal of Cleaner Production; Papadopoulos, T., Gunasekaran, A., Dubey, R., Fosso Wamba, S., Childe, S.J., World Class Sustainability.

Angkasa Pura II as part of Soekarno Hatta International Airport (SHIA) management in Indonesia, has been preparing for Asean Economic Community (AEC) 2015. The objective of this paper is to assess airport performance through evidences that Industrial and System Engineering (SYS Eng) influences mentioned Performance (PER Frm). Second, the method utilizes Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) through interviews, questionnaires, and statistical method as its exposition about SYS Eng that influences Performance. Third, the Result in SEM, represents Validity Test of Indicator, Reliability Test, and Level of Suitability Model. Fourth, as Conclusion, SYS Eng influences Performance of 0.81 Level. That influence level is acceptable level and proven by results of SEM Model by its Variables of SE and Performa; Constructs and Questionnaires. Those results are beneficial for SHIA and larger audience as benchmark and future research. Thus, this paper achieves its objectives to assess airport performance. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

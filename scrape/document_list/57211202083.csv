Revenue in the mining industry from year to year has continued to decline, and this has an impact on large companies that have an impact on the company's performance and profits. Through this problem the researcher aims to propose a prediction model in the mining industry using deep learning (DL), which has not been widely applied in financial revenue especially in the mining sector. This study uses a model of neural network LSTM learning approaches. The implementation of financial revenue prediction is done by comparing the LSTM model with an ARIMA. Data obtained for the last 6 years 2012-2017 from data set of mining industry processed by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources and the World Bank. The evaluation model is compared between LSTM and ARIMA used by root mean squared error (RMSE). In the ARIMA prediction with model (5, 1, 0) a ratio of 0.1 coefficients and a standard error below 1, p value below 0, this indicates that the LSTM model has better accuracy compared to ARIMA with an average error of 0.24 on revenue indicators and 0.32 on the price indicator commodity.

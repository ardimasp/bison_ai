These considerations relate to a consumer's desire to purchase a product. The purpose of this study is to know the perception from the consumer profile, in this case, the socioeconomic characteristics of respondents toward a popular energy drink brand from Sido Muncul, i.e., Kuku Bima Ener-G, and to identify the impact of all variables, i.e., perceived value, attitude, and trust, toward purchase intention of that product as well. The research methods used are descriptive analysis and multiple regression. Using the nonprobability sampling technique to gather 181 respondents, the results obtained the three dominant factors from each variable and a description of the dominant characteristics from respondents; thus, we found a significant influence among all independent variables on purchasing decisions of energy drinks products. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Consumer behaviour; Consumer profile; Energy drink; Purchase intention",,,,,,"The authors wish to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika journal team that help publish this article.","Adji, J., Semuel, H., Pengaruh satisfaction dan trust terhadap minat beli konsumen (Purchase Intention) di Starbucks The Square Surabaya [The influence of satisfaction and trust on consumers' Purchase Intention at Starbucks The Square Surabaya (2014) Jurnal Manajemen Pemasaran, 2 (1), pp. 1-10; Alam, M.

The gamification is integrated in some e-learning management systems, and it is expected to increase the students’ satisfaction, motivation, and engagement. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in elearning. For this purpose, an educational website, www.bangsacerdas.com, is established, where the survey is conducted for registered students. There are two parts of participants: the students who are directed to a learning system with gamification and the students who are enrolled in a learning system without gamification. During the process, the level of user engagement and the quality of learning are being evaluated in each group. The t-test results for these two populations suggest that there are significant improvements in the learning experience of the participants in the classes that implement the gamification in their system. © 2018, ICIC International.

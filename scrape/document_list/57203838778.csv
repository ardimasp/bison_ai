Moreover, most of them have the same service or feature for serving their customers. To get back the feedback of their customers, many companies use social media (Facebook and Twitter) for marketing activity or communicating directly with their customers. The development of current technology allows the company to take data from social media. Thus, many companies take social media data for analyses. This study proposed developing a data warehouse to analyze data in social media such as likes, comments, and sentiment. Since the sentiment is not provided directly from social media data, this study uses lexicon based classification to categorize the sentiment of users' comments. This data warehouse provides business intelligence to see the performance of the company based on their social media data. The data warehouse is built using three travel companies in Indonesia. As a result, this data warehouse provides the comparison of the performance based on the social media data. © 2018 Halmstad University.","Business intelligence; Lexicon based classification; Sentiment analysis; Social media",,,,,,"Adriani, M., Asian, J., Nazief, B., Tahaghoghi, S.M., Williams, H.E., Stemming Indonesian: A confix-stripping approach (2007) Journal ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing (TALIP); Alalwan, A.A., Rana, N.P., Dwivedi, Y.K., Algharabatc, R., Social media in marketing: A review and analysis of the existing literature (2017) Telematics and Informatics, pp. 1177-1190; Atmadjati, A., (2012) Era Maskapai Saat Ini, , Yogyakarta: Leutika Prio; Barlow, J., Maul, D., (2000) Emotional Value: Creating Strong Bonds with Your Customers, , San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler Pub-lishers, Inc; Bo, P., Lee, L., Vaithyanathan, S., Thumbs up?

One method is to build a culture of innovation. This paper seeks to evaluate the manufacturing industry in Indonesia and analyze whether an innovation culture provides support in improving the performance of the company. Dynamic capability and leadership are also very important factors in improving the performance of a company. A study conducted on 190 food and beverage companies in Indonesia showed that the culture of innovation does not directly provide improve performance of a company, and increased dynamic capability and leadership skills can improve company performance. An increase in innovation culture will affect company performance through the development of dynamic capability. This study is helpful to practitioners in the manufacturing industry to improve performance in economically turbulent conditions. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

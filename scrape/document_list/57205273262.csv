From 1 January 2020 to 15 April 2020, the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information was able to identify 534 misinformation circulating in the country. False information during a pandemic may pose a serious threat to public health. Therefore, this study aims to identify the type and claims of misinformation from all 534 articles. Also, based on the results, this study aims to give recommendations for dealing with misinformation in Indonesia. This research uses a qualitative approach through systematic analysis, where all articles were analyzed by three human coders based on a predefined coding scheme. Results show that the most common type is a reconfiguration from old or genuine materials compared to fully fabricated content. While the most common claims are concerning community spread and public authority action. Based on the results, this paper recommends reducing the number of misinformation through three perspectives - identification of misinformation, platforms, and support for targeted people. © 2020 IEEE.","COVID-19; Disinformation; Indonesia; Misinformation","Information management; Coding scheme; Indonesia; Public authorities; Qualitative approach; Systematic analysis; Health risks",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

Youtube as the number 1 social media in Indonesia, has an important role as a promotional strategy media for beauty products. Research design, data and methodology: This study used the online survey to 210 female respondents aged 17-30 years who became a subscriber of an Indonesian beauty influencer. Simple regression and multiple regressions were performed to analyze the independent variables towards the dependent variable. Results: The results show that social media influencer, electronic word of mouth, and perceived quality simultaneously have a significant influence on purchase intention. Nevertheless, only two variables individually have a significant influence on purchase intention, which is social media influencer and perceived quality. Conclusions: Perceived quality and social media influencer could be the best strategies to increase consumers when promoting through the influencer's Youtube channel by utilizing a subscriber. While e-WOM can be influential on other social media platforms rather than on the Youtube platform. Therefore, suggested that digital marketer must use multiple social media platforms to increase consumers' purchase intention. © The Author(s).","Electronic word of mouth; Perceived quality; Purchase intention; Social media influencer; Youtube",,,,,"Binus University","* This Reasearch was financially supported by Bina Nusantara University.","Asshidin, N.H.N., Abidin, N., Borhan, H.B., Perceived Quality and Emotional Value that Influence Consumer's Purchase Intention towards American and Local Products (2016) Procedía Economics and Finance, 55 (2016), pp. 639-643. , https://doi.org/10.1016/s2212-5671(16)00078-2; Awad, N.F., Ragowsky, A., Establishing trust in electronic commerce through online word of mouth: An examination across genders (2008) Journal of Management Information Systems, 24 (4), pp. 101-121; Bou-Llusar, J., Camison-Zornoza, C., Escrig-Tena, A.B., Measuring the relationship between firm perceived quality and customer satisfaction and its influence on purchase intentions (2001) Journal of Total Quality Management, 12 (6), pp. 719-734; Brown, J., Broderick, A.J., Lee, N., Word of Mouth Communication Within Online Communities: Conceptualizing the Online Social Network (2007) Journal of Interactive Marketing, 21 (3), pp. 2-20. , https://doi.org/10.1002/dir.20082; Cheng, L.P., Effects of Brand Image, Perceived Price, Perceived Quality, and Perceived Value on the Purchase Intention towards Sports and Tourism Products of the 2016 Taichung International Travel Fair (2017) The Journal of International Management Studies, 12 (2), pp. 97-107; Cheung, M.Y., Luo, C., Sia, C.L., Chen, H., Credibility of electronic word-of-mouth: Informational and normative determinants of on-line consumer recommendations (2009) International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 13 (4), pp. 9-38; de Veirman, M., Marketing through Instagram influencers: The impact of number of followers and product divergence on brand attitude (2017) International Conference on Research Om Advertising (ICORIA) 2016, 36 (5), pp. 798-828; Durmaz, A., Yüksel, M., The Effect of Ewom on Purchase Intention: Evidence From E-Commerce Sites Ağizdan Ağlletişimin Satin AlmNiyetinEtkisi: ETicareSiteleriŪzerineBir Araştirma (2017) Suleyman Demirel University The Journal of Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences Y, 22 (1), pp. 231-239. , http://iibfdergi.sdu.edu.tr/assets/uploads/sites/352/files/yil-2017-cilt-22-sayi-1-yazi19-18022017.pdf, Retrieved from; Erkan, I., Evans, C., The influence of eWOM in social media on consumers' purchase intentions: An extended approach to information adoption (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, 61 (2016), pp. 47-55. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2016.03.003; Goyette, I., Ricard, L., Bergeron, J., Marticotter, F., E-WOM Scale: Word of-Mouth Measurement Scale for eServices Context (2010) Canadian Journal of Administrative Sciences, 27 (1), pp. 5-23; Ha, N.M., Lam, N.H., The Effects of Celebrity Endorsement on Customer's Attitude toward Brand and Purchase Intention (2016) International Journal of Economics and Finance, 9 (1), pp. 64-77. , https://doi.org/10.5539/ijef.v9n1p64; Henricks, M., (1998) Spread the Word, Entrepreneur, , 26(6), 120125; Heriyati, S., Effects of word of mouth communication and perceived quality on decision making moderated by gender: Jakarta blackberry smartphone consumer's perspective (2011) Contemporary Management Research, 7 (4), pp. 329-336; Hui, T.X., The Effect of source credibility on consumers' purchase intention in Malaysia online community (2017) Journal of Arts and Social Sciences, 1 (1), pp. 12-20; Jamil, R.A., Influence of Celebrity Endorsement on Consumer Purchase Intention for Existing Products: A Comparative Study (2014) Journal of Management Info, 4(1), 1-23; Kamins, M.A., An Investigation into the ""Match-up"" Hypothesis in Celebrity Advertising: When Beauty May Be Only Skin Deep (1990) Journal of Advertising, 19 (1), pp. 4-13; Kotler, P., Keller, K.K., (2016) Marketing Managemen, , (15th ed.).

This study aims to determine the motives of the Internet in teenagers and to examine the differences in Internet motives based on gender, education level, and school affiliation. Data from a probability sample of 756 teenagers aged 10-19 years were represented by students of junior high schools and senior high schools in Jakarta. Descriptive analysis revealed that Indonesian teenagers' Internet motives are status gaining, opinion expression, social interactions, information gaining, pastime, and entertainment. The three highest motives are pastime, entertainment, and information gaining. The t-test analysis revealed the level of education and school affiliation are significant differentiating factors, while gender is not a significant differentiating factor. Internet motives of senior high school teenagers differed significantly in all types of motives compared to junior high school student teenagers. In addition, in almost all types of motives, teenagers in public schools have a higher mean than teenagers in religion-affiliated schools. Teenagers need a complete social media application that provide tools that can represent their feelings, opinions, status, as well fun and entertaining.

This research uses descriptive qualitative methods in which semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data in Indonesia (Jakarta) and United Kingdom (Norwich). The result shows that students’ intercultural communication competence improve due to direct communication and face-to-face interaction instead of social media whereby the latter is only helpful in improving students’ knowledge and understanding the differences of their home culture and the host culture. Interactivity and other abilities of social media become influential aspect to improve students’ knowledge of host culture. Moreover, social media develops relationships between the students and their hosts country. Facebook and Instagram are found to help students improve their adaptability and flexibility to different cultures. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Culture European and Indonesian students; Intercultural communication; Social media",,,,,,,"Barrett, M., Intercultural competence (2012) The 2 nd Issue of the EWC Statement Series.

In Indonesia, Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi (Corruption Eradication Commission) has been using IMC to disseminate anticorruption values to society in purpose to reduce and eliminate corruption acts in Indonesia. To improve the effectiveness of IMC on anticorruption campaign, particularly to the youth, this study aims to measure students’s attitude towards anticorruption values. It is also to describe the exposure of the agency’s IMC programs on anticorruption campaign to students, and to discuss the relationship between the two variables: anticorruption campaign exposure and students’s attitude towards anticorruption values. Quantitative approach is used by conducting a survey to Bina Nusantara University students. Descriptive and correlation analysis are used to analyze the data. It is found that students fairly accept the anticorruption values, although there is still lack of exposure to them on the IMC programs. The correlation analysis shows no significant relationship between the two variables. However, the students can accept the importance of anticorruption values which this fact can support the work of the initiator in doing their future campaign. Further research is suggested to conduct it in wider scope. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

In this research, simulation is done to measure the delivery performance and all the processes included in delivery process. In fact, every process has their own risks could delay delivery process that the delivery performance is reduced. The methods used to identify the risks and the causes are Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). Risks analysis is done with the help of Pareto diagrams and scatter plot to determine the risks need to be corrected immediately. The proposed improvements are integrating the systems in form of e-cargo ready and implementing bar-coding. After the proposed e-cargo ready applied and being simulated, the delivery performance in terms of average total time reduced by 29,398%. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Delivery performance; FMEA; FTA; Simulation","Fault tree analysis; Risk analysis; Delivery performance; Delivery process; Failure mode and effects analysis; Fault tree analyses (FTA); FMEA; Improving delivery performance; Pareto diagrams; Simulation; Risk assessment",,,,,"Afolayan, A., White, G.R., Mason-Jones, R., (2016) Why Knowledge Acquisition Is Important to Effective Supply Chain Management: The Role of Supply Chain Managers 'As Knowledge Acquisitors; Peng, D.X., Lu, G., Exploring the impact of delivery performance on customer transaction volume and unit price: Evidence from an assembly manufacturing supply chain (2017) Production and Operations Management, 26 (5), pp. 880-902; Mewborn, S., Murphy, J., Williams, G., (2014) Clearing the Roadblocks to Better B2B Pricing, 12; Ghadge, A., Fang, X., Dani, S., Antony, J., Supply chain risk assessment approach for process quality risks (2017) International Journal of Quality & Reliability Management, 34 (7), pp. 940-954; Ruijters, E., Stoelinga, M., Fault tree analysis: A survey of the state-of-the-art in modeling, analysis and tools (2015) Computer Science Review, 15-16, pp. 29-62; Ehsanifar, M., Hamta, N., Hemesy, M., A Simulation Approach to Evaluate Performance Indices of Fuzzy Exponential Queuing System (An M/M/C Model in a Banking Case Study) (2017) Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management, 4, pp. 35-51; Ramírez, C.S., López, D.R.M., Hernández, G.A., Alcaraz, J.L.G., Mendoza, D.A.T., Simulation software as a tool for supply chain analysis and improvement (2016) Computer Science and Information Systems, 13 (3), pp. 983-998; Shirani, M., Demichela, M., Integration of FMEA and human factor in the food chain risk assessment (2015) World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, International Journal of Social, Behavioral, Educational, Economic, Business and Industrial Engineering, 9, pp. 4247-4250; Held, M., Brönnimann, R., Safe cell, safe battery?

A reliable and complete datasets of urban storm inundation area in Indonesia should become its basis to give clear description of inundation area for formulating the best solution. In this study, Statistics Indonesia data in thirty three provinces were assessed during 2000 until 2012 providing data series of urban flood area, flood frequency and land cover changes. Drainage system condition in big cities should be well understood to ensure its infrastructure condition and performance. If inundation occurred, it can be concluded that there is drainage system problem. Inundation data is also important for drainage system design process in the future. The study result is provided estimation of urban storm inundation area based on calculation of Statistics Indonesia data. Moreover, this study is preceded by analyzing and reviewing the capacity of existing drainage channel, using case study of Mataram, West Nusa Tenggara. Rainfall data was obtained from three rainfall stations surround Mataram City. The storm water quantity was calculated using three different approaches as follows: 1) Rational Method; 2) Summation of existing inundation and surface run off discharge; 3) Discharge calculation from existing channel dimensions. After that, the result of these approaches was compared. The storm water quantity gap was concluded as quantity of inundation. The result shows that 36% of drainage channel in Brenyok Kanan River sub system could not accommodate the storm water runoff in this area, which causing inundation. The redesign of drainage channel using design discharge from Rational Method approach should be performed. Within area with the lowest level topography, a construction of detention or storage pond is essential to prevent inundation in this area. Furthermore, the benefits and drawbacks of the statistics database are discussed. Recommendations include utilizing more refined urban land use typologies that can better represent physical alteration of hydrological pathways. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Drainage Channel Capacity; Inundation; Statistics data Indonesia; Storm Water Quantity","Digital storage; Floods; Land use; Rain; Runoff; Storms; Systems analysis; Channel dimension; Discharge calculation; Drainage channels; Indonesia; Inundation; Land-cover change; Storm water runoff; Stormwaters; Drainage",,,,,"Dewan, A.M., Yamaguchi, Y., Effect of Land Cover Changes on Flooding: Example from Greater Dhaka of Bangladesh (2008) International Journal of Geornformafrcs, 4; Merz, B., Hall, J., Disse, M., Schumann, A., Fluvial Flood Risk Management in A Changing World (2010) Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, 10 (3), pp. 509-527; Baldassare, B., Matteo, B., Giovanna, G., A Semiprobabilistic Approach for the Design of A Flood Control Reservoir (2010) Advances in Water Resources, 62, pp. 37-46; Ball, T., Hendry, S., Werritty, A., Spray, C.J., (2009) Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009, , (Sweet and Maxwell Statues Annotated); Basnayaka Amila, P., Sarukkalige, R., Werellagama, I., Numerical Modeling of Flood Vulnerability in Urban Catchments for Flood Forecastin (2011) International Journal of Environmental Science and Development, 2, pp. 383-388; Chen, A.S., Hsu, M.H., Chen, T.S., Chang, T.J., An Integrated Inundation Model for Highly Developed Urban Areas (2005) Water Science and Technology, 51, pp. 221-229; Yiping, G., Zhengji, Z., Analytical Probabilistic Flood Routing for Urban Stormwater Management Purposes (2008) Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, 35 (5), p. 487; Joong Gwang, L., Heaney James, P., Estimation of Urban Imperviousness and its Impacts on Storm Water Systems (2003) Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management, 129 (5), pp. 419-426; Akm Saiful, I., Sujit Kumar, B., Anisul, H., Flood Inundation Map of Bangladesh Using Modis Surface Reflectance Data (2009) Journal of Flood Risk Management, 3 (3), pp. 210-222; Zhang, J., Hori, T., Tatano, H., Norio, O., Chao, Z., Takuya, M., GIS and Flood Inundation Model-based Flood Risk Assessment in Urbanized Floodplain.

Utilization of rainwater as clean water resource is among the best option, especially in big cities like Jakarta. Excessive rainwater during wet season can be saved and used as the source of clean water during dry seasons. However, rainwater contains some pollutants, thus suitable treatment method should be utilized to improve its quality as clean water for daily needs. This study compared the effectiveness of zeolite, limestone, activated carbon and preheated 400°C limestone as additive to improve the rainwater quality. Results show that both limestone and preheated 400°C limestone improve all the parameters observed, meanwhile both activated carbon and zeolite had shown to have detrimental effect on water conductivity. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",,"Activated carbon; Limestone; Pollution; Water pollution; Water resources; Zeolites; Clean water resources; Clean waters; Dry seasons; Jakarta; Rainwater quality; Treatment methods; Water conductivity; Wet season; Activated carbon treatment",,,,,"(2016), http://savethewater.org/education-resources/water-facts, Information (August); (2016), http://www.ipsnews.net/2000/02/environment-indonesia-drowing-in-water-woes, Information (August); (2016), http://rainharvesting.com.au/knowledgecenter/reasons-for-using-rainwater, Information (August); (2016), http://www.bmkg.go.id/BMKG_Pusat/Kualitas_Udara/Informasi_Kimia_Air_Hujan.bmkg, Information (August); (2016), http://www.lenntech.com/applications/ultrapure/conductivity/water-conductivity.htm, Information (November); (2016), http://water.usgs.gov/edu/ph.html, Information (November); (2016), http://www.waterresearch.net/index.php/water-treatment/tools/totaldissolved-solids, Information (November); Syafalni, M.S., Setyandito, O., Han Yang, F., (2014) IJAES, 9, pp. 1811-1826; Gholikandi, G.B., Baneshi, M.M., Dehghanifara, E., Salehi, S., Yari, A.R., (2010) IJOT, 3, pp. 302-310; (2016), http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewhsemt/pubs/water-eau/devices-dispositifs-eng.php, Information (November); (2016), http://www.randwater.co.za/waterandinfastructuremanagement/pages/waterpurification.aspx, Information (November); Syafalni, S., Abustan, I., Dahlan, I., Chan, K.W., Umar, G., (2012) MAS, 6, pp. 37-51; Syafalni, S., Abustan, I., Brahmana, A., Zakaria, N.F., Abdullah, R., (2013) MAS, 7, pp. 39-49; Malau, G.G., (2014) Perbaikan Kualitas Air Hujan Untuk Air Minum (Menggunakan Karbon Aktif, Batu Kapur Alami, Batu Kapur Yang Dipanaskan 400 C Dan Zeolite), Bachelor Thesis, , (Bina Nusantara University); Sentoso, Y., (2014) Perbaikan Kualitas Air Hujan Menggunakan Karbon Aktif, Batu Bata,Limestone Dan Zeolit Untuk Air Minum, Bachelor Thesis, , (Bina Nusantara University)","Meilani; Civil Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: meilani@binus.edu","Iskandar I.Agustina T.E.Komariah L.N.Ismadji S.Yani I.Hasyim S.","","EDP Sciences","1st Sriwijaya International Conference on Engineering, Science and Technology, SICEST 2016","9 November 2016 through 10 November 2016",,126687,2261236X,,,,"English","MATEC Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015848938

Rigid pavement using pervious concrete can absorb water in the surface to go straight through the concrete to the ground below.This water flow is one of the benefit of using the pervious concrete. Using of wastes such as broken roof and ceramics tiles are not commonly used in Indonesia. Utilization these kind of wastes is predicted lower the compressive strength of pervious concrete as they are used as a substitute for coarse aggregate.In this research, pervious concrete is made using a mixture of the fragment of ceramics and roof tiles.This research using broken ceramics and roof tiles with a grain size that loose from 38 mm sieve, retained on 19 mm sieve and the coarse aggregate from crushed stone that loose 12.5 mm sieve, retained on 9.5 mm sieve. The water cement ratio is 0.3 and to assist the mixing process, the addition of addictive in pervious concrete is used.The size of coarse aggregate used in the mixture affects the strength of pervious concrete. The larger the size of aggregate, the obtained compressive strength becomes smaller. It also affects the density of pervious concrete. The using of mixture of ceramics and roof tiles only reduce 2 MPa of pervious concrete compressive strength so this mixture can be used as a substitute for coarse aggregate with a maximum portion of 30 %. The high porosity of the specimens causes the reduction of pervious concrete density that affect the compressive strength. This high level of porosity can be seen from the high level of water absorption that exceed the required limit of water infiltration. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.","Ceramics tile fragment; Compressive strength; Pervious concrete; Roof tile fragments",,,,,,"(2006) Stormwater Management with Pervious Concrete Pavements, , American Concrete Pavement Association.; Illinois; (1995) Teknologi Beton, , Antono; Yogyakarta; Putra, B.H., (2011) Studi Analisa Campuran Beton Berpori Sebagai Material Ramah Lingkungan Berdasarkan Nilai Kuat Tekan Dan Tingkat Peresapan Air, , Jakarta; Dan, B., (2003) Pervious Concrete Pavement: A Win-Win System, , Michigan; Chopra, M., Wanielista, M., (2007) Performance Assesment of Portland Cement Pervious Pavement, , Orlando; Norbert, D., (2007) Field Performance of Portland Cement Pervious Concrete Pavement in Cold Weather Climates; Jamie, F., (2004) Concrete Technology Today, , Illinois; Harmoko, A., (2011) Studi Analisa Pemanfaatan Limbah Bahan Padat Pada Beton Berpori Sebagai Material Ramah Lingkungan Berdasarkan Nilai Kuat Tekan Dan Tingkat Peresapan Air, , Skripsi, Jurusan Teknik Sipil, Fakultas Teknik, Universitas Bina Nusantara; Jakarta; Febianto, H., (2006) Pemanfaatan Limbah Bahan Padat Sebagai Agregat Kasar Pada Pembuatan Beton Normal, , Yogyakarta; Mahboub, K.C., Jonathan, C., Robert, R., Thomas, R., Blake, D., (2009) Pervious Concrete: Compaction and Aggregate Gradation; (2003) Concrete Technology, , PCA.; Inggris; (1996) Bata Beton, , SNI 03-0691-1996; (pavling block); Jakarta; Schaefer, V., Wang, K., Suleiman, M., Kevern, J., (2006) Mix Design Development for Pervious Concrete in Cold Weather Climates, , Iowa; Tjokrodimuljo, K., (1995) Bahan Bangunan, , Yogyakarta; Tennis, Paul, D., Michael, L., Akers, D.J., (2004) Pervious Concrete Pavements, , Illinois; Obla, K.H., (2007) Pervious Concrete for Sustainable Development, , Washington",,,"","EDP Sciences","2013 International Conference on Advances Science and Contemporary Engineering, ICASCE 2013","23 October 2013 through 24 October 2013","Jakarta",,21016275,,,,"English","EPJ Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901442047

This study contributes by identifying predictor variables of prisoner's learned helplessness. The design of this research is quantitative-predictive correlational design. This research hypothesized that social rejection and three types of neurotic personality orientations (moving away from people, moving against people, and moving toward people) are able to predict learned helplessness of prisoners. As it is known in the literature of Knowledge Management, learned helplessness lessens one's effort to understand complex issues. In addition, prospective approach to knowledge management suggests that learned helplessness should be transformed into learned optimism. The participants of this research were 163 inmates from Cipinang IA Penitentiary Institution and Pondok Bambu IIA Prison in DKI Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia. The measurement tools of this study were adapted and developed from Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire, Karen Horney's Three Orientations, and Learned Helplessness Scales. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that social rejection and the tendency of ""moving toward"" are not able to predict learned helplessness. The tendency of ""moving away"" and of ""moving against"" are able to predict learned helplessness in the negative ways. All results of this research will be discussed by employing relevant psychological theories and knowledge management perspective. The implication of result of this research toward efforts in facilitating learning as well as knowledge creation and management of prisoners in prison is proposed in the Discussion section of this article. The authors are of the position that if all these things are well facilitated, the prisoners will be a valuable social capital for Indonesia.","Knowledge management; Learned helplessness; Psychology","Forecasting; Linear regression; Prisons; Regression analysis; Knowledge creations; Learned helplessness; Measurement tools; Multiple linear regression analysis; Predictor variables; Psychological theory; Psychology; Social capitals; Knowledge management",,,,,"Coolidge, F.L., Segal, D.L., Benight, C.C., Danielian, J., The Predictive Power of Horney's Psychoanalytic Approach: An Empirical Study (2004) The American Journal of Psychoanalysis, 64 (4), pp. 363-374; Downey, G., Feldman, S.I., Implications of Rejection Sensitivity for Intimate Relationships (1996) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70 (6), pp. 1327-1343. , http://socialrelations.psych.columbia.edu/measures/rs-personal/24-rejection-sensitivity-questionnaire-rsq, online; El-Den, J., Applying Positive Psychology to Knowledge Management (2012), Paper presented at The European Conference on Knowledge Management (ECKM), Cartagena, Spain, September 5-6; Kejahatan Korupsi Berjalan Cepat Dibanding Hukum (2011), http://www.ti.or.id/index.ph/news/2011/10/14/kejahatan-korupsi-berjalan-cepat-dibanding-hukum, online; Fasabeni, M., Pembebasan Bersyarat Corby Ditentang (2014), http://www.gresnews.com/berita/hukum/18062-pembebasan-bersyarat-corby-ditentang/, online; Fiske, S.T., Harris, L.T., Cuddy, A.J.C., Why Ordinary People Torture Enemy Prisoners (2004) Science, 306 (5701), pp. 1482-1483; Greco, M., Stenner, P., Happiness and the Art of Life: Diagnosing the Psychopolitics of Wellbeing (2013) Health, Culture and Society, 5 (1), pp. 1-18; Haslam, S.A., Reicher, S.D., When Prisoners Take Over the Prison: A Social Psychology of Resistance (2012) Personality and Social Psychology, 16 (2), pp. 154-179; Psychoanalytic Social Theory-Karen Horney (2010), http://www.ivcc.edu/uploadedFiles/_faculty/_mangold/Horney%20and%20Psychoanalytic%20Social%20Theory.pdf, online; Kim, S.H., Vincent, L.C., Goncalo, J.A., Outside Advantage: Can Social Rejection Fuel Creative Thought?

This fish has become one of the profitable business opportunities for fish farmers, mainly for export to overseas because the price is quite expensive. However, Discus fish is difficult to maintain since it is susceptible to various diseases. An expert system application utilizing fuzzy logic is presented to resolve this problem by diagnosing diseases of the discus fish. It is expected to help beginner fish farmers to detect the disease in the earliest time. Besides diagnosing, this desktop-based application can be exploited to get more information about the diseases in order to prevent and treat the Discus fish. The algorithm shows a good result which achieves 90.32% of accuracy. © 2015 IEEE.","diagnosis; Discus; disease; expert system; fuzzy logic","Agriculture; Computer circuits; Diagnosis; Diseases; Expert systems; Fish; Reconfigurable hardware; Business opportunities; Discus; Fish disease; Fuzzy logic approach; System applications; Fuzzy logic",,,,,"(2013) Green Economy and Trade-Trends, Challenges and Opportunities, , http://www.unep.org/greeneconomy/Portals/88/GETReport/pdf/Chapitre%203%20Fisheries.pdf; Rahmati-Holasso, H., Capillariosis in breeder discus (Symphysodon aequifasciatus) in Iran (2010) Journal of Agricultural Science, 55 (3), pp. 253-259; Airbaiy, N., Wen, C.C., Suradi, Z., Freshwater fish disease diagnosis system development (2007) Intermational Conference on IT Research and Application 2007 (CITRA), , http://www.academia.edu/2518075/Freshwater_Fish_Diagnosis_System_Using_Expert_System, Retrieved 25 October, 2013; Elfani, Pujiyanta, A., Sistem pakar mendiagnosa penyakit pada ikan konsumsi air tawar berbasis website (2013) Jurnal Sarjana Teknik Informatika, 1 (1), pp. 42-50; Wahyudi, M.J., Fadlil, A., Sistem pakar untuk mengidentifikasi penyakit udang galah dengan metode theorema bayes (2013) Jurnal Sarjana Teknik Informatika, 1 (1), pp. 11-20; Lopes, J.N.S., Goncalves, A.N.A., Fujimoto, R.Y., Carvalho, J.C.C., Diagnosis of fish diseases using artificial neural networks (2011) International Journal of Computer Science Issues, 8 (3-6), pp. 68-74; Giovanetti, T.A., (1992) Discus Fish.

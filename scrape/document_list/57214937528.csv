With the latest communication technology called 5 Generation (5G), network speed is no longer an obstacle. But this can be done in countries that have adopted the 5G technology and there is still a lot of preparation needed by other countries to be able to maximize this 5G technology especially in the field of telemedicine. In this study, we will explain what is the challenge applying telesurgery with the help of 5G connections, especially in hospitals that have limited network connections. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Not all the mistyped words are totally wrong. If they are caused by human errors, we should look further to handle it. Thus, enhanced version of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is proposed. LSA is enhanced by calculating the value of mistyped words before constructing the term document matrix. Essays which are scored consists of 119 English essays of student's writing assignment while several essays as gold standard are made by experts. All of the essays have been scored manually by the human grader. Enhanced LSA gives the closeness level of 0.242 to human judgment, while LSA indicates the closeness level of 0.244 to human judgment. Unfortunately, Enhanced LSA cannot outperform GLSA which is one of current methods. The experiment result indicates that Enhanced LSA by considering mistyped words has a better closeness value to human judgment compared with LSA. © 2016 IEEE.","enhanced LSA; Latent Semantic Analysis; mistyped words; term document matrix","Matrix algebra; Automated essay scoring; Document matrices; enhanced LSA; Gold standards; Human judgments; Latent Semantic Analysis; mistyped words; Writing assignments; Semantics",,,,,"Hyland, K., (2004) Disciplinary Discourses: Social Interactions in Academic Writing, , Michigan: The University of Michigan Press; Wild, F., Stahl, C., Stermsek, G., Neumann, G., Parameters Driving Effectiveness of Automated Essay Scoring with LSA (2005) Proceedings of the 9th CAA Conference Loughborough; Dikli, S., Automated Essay Scoring (2006) Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education, 7 (5), pp. 49-62; Dikli, S., An Overview of Automated Scoring of Essays (2006) Journal of Technology, Learning, and Assessment, 5 (1); Landauer, T.K., Foltz, P.W., Laham, D., Introduction to Latent Semantic Analysis (1998) Discourse Processes, 25, pp. 259-284; Islam, M.M., Hoque, S.M.L., Automated Essay Scoring Using Generalized Latent Semantic Analysis (2012) Journal of Computers, 7 (3); Hofmann, T., Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (1999) Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, UAI""99, Stockholm; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 993-1022; Valenti, S., Neri, F., Cucchiarelli, A., An Overview of Current Research on Automated Essay Grading (2003) Journal of Information Technology Education, 2",,,"APTIKOM","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1st International Conference on Informatics and Computing, ICIC 2016","28 October 2016 through 29 October 2016",,127421,,9781509016488,,,"English","Int.

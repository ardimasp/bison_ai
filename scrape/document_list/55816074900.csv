This discourse focuses on the lens of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and Machine Learning of Artificial Intelligence (MLAI). To some extent several companies have embarked Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 within Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Through the wave of IoT Technology, Industries are adopting automated machinery. Predictive maintenance (PM) is indispensable not only toward the machines"" vitality and longevity purpose, but also toward the human error reduction. This paper elaborates its discourse of Industry 4.0 and Society through the lens of CBM and MLAI. The mentioned Machine Learning, in this paper, refers to research methodology, as methodological frameworks. Those frameworks comprise several phases, which are: 1. Equipment Analysis; 2. Data Evaluation; 3. Data Selection and Process; 4. Modeling; 5. Decision Support Model Evaluation. The MLAI techniques are based upon the identification of behaviour patterns. This identification comprises datasets that exclude mathematical models or prior historical knowledge. The discourse in this paper intertwines CBM process and MLAI through data cleaning and processing, features stratification and extraction, model stratification and validation. This paper elaborates two renowned maintenance approaches which are preventive and corrective maintenance. Discourse in this paper focuses on corrective action, known as predictive maintenance (PM), or condition based maintenance (CBM) within Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). CBM is chosen as the most desirable strategy, as it involves the intervention as the consequence of the machine breakdown. It also provides cost savings toward spare parts consumption, and optimizes production. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

A novel approach for classifying, using support vector machines (SVM) is presented in this paper. Fruit classification based on their shape is proposed in this work. The system differentiates the fruit based on their shape. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is extracted and later used as input to the SVM-based identifier. The fruit parameters are compared and classified, the results of computer simulation show that this technique produces better accuracy than that of the existing technique that is based on artificial neural network (Ann).

The objective of this study is to elaborate research on food industry and its competitive strategy through perspectives of Industrial Engineering (IE) and Doctor of Research in Management (DRM). The mentioned competitive strategy requires the Human Resources Management (HRM) and the integration of Resource-Based View (RBV) and Dynamic Capability (DC). The HRM are supported by the research deployment of Chadwick, Super and Kwoon pertaining Strategic Human Resources Management (SHRM). Meanwhile, the SHRM involves the Resource Orchestration of Company's CEO, Top Management Team (TMT) and employees; through various literatures of management's value on HRM by Bae and Lawler, Bennet, Ketchen and Schultz, Osterman and CEO's supports on HRM by Sheehan. Furthermore, both RBV and DC are supported by prior research by Kruasoma and Saenchaiyathon that enhanced the Resources Based Theory (RBT) by Barney and Clark and Bromiley and Rau; similarly, the DC and Strategic Management (SM) is enhanced by Teece. Processing and data analysis in this study refers to Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using SmartPLS Software and its questionnaire. As the perspectives of Industrial Engineering (IE), this study elaborates the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for Decision Hierarchy and Malcolm Baldrige Criteria (MBC) for Performance Excellence (PE). Furthermore as the perspectives of DRM, this study elaborates SEM in term of analysis of antecedents, behaviors and consequences. The questionnaire refers to the variable of Leadership (LDRSHP), Organizational Learning (ORGLRN), Innovation (INNOVA) and Performance (PERFRM), through their constructs and indicators. Those variables are the base of one of this studies researchers Khristian Edi Nugroho Soebandrija's draft of dissertation study. Yet, this study provides different approach as compared to the mentioned dissertation. © Medwell Journals, 2016.","Competitive strategy; Doctor of Research in Management (DRM); Food industry; Industrial engineering (IE); SmartPLS; Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)",,,,,,"Andrews, S., (2013) Food and Beverage Service: A Training Manual, p. 379. , Tata McGraw-Hill Education, New Delhi, India; Bae, J., Lawler, J.J., Organizational and FfRM strategies in Korea: Impact on firm performance in an emerging economy (2000) Acad.

ADM) which still using the email cause the time of claim settlement become longer and finally it causes the rejected of SMQR claim by supplier. With presence of this problem then performed to design the integrated communication system to manage the communication process of SMQR claim between PT. ADM with supplier. The systems was analyzed and designed is expected to facilitate the claim communication process so that can be run in accordance with the procedure and fulfill the target of claim settlement time and also eliminate the difficulties and problems on the previous manual communication system with the email. The design process of the system using the approach of system development life cycle method by Kendall & Kendall (2006)which design process covers the SMQR problem communication process, judgment process by the supplier, claim process, claim payment process and claim monitoring process. After getting the appropriate system designs for managing the SMQR claim, furthermore performed the system implementation and can be seen the improvement in claim communication process and settlement time become faster and achieve the target. The conclusion in this paper comprises two major aspects. The first one refers to the conclusion in term of theory and concept. The second one refers to the conclusion in term of the empirical study of one of automotive industries in Indonesia. Both of them are expected to have contribution in current and future research of related aspects that are discussed in this paper. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.","Analysis and Design Systems; Communication Systems; Information Technology; Innovation; SMQR Claim",,,,,,"Almajali, D.A., Dahalin, M.Z., (2011) Factors Influencing IT-Business Strategic Alignment and Sustainable Competitive Advantage: A Structural Equation Modelling Approach, , IBIMA Publishing; Benner, M.J., Tushman, M.L., Process management and technological innovation: A longitudinal study of the photography and paint industries (2002) Administration Science Quarterly, 47, pp. 676-706; Benner, M.J., Tushman, M.L., Exploitation, exploration, and process management: The productivity dilemma revisited (2003) Academy of Management Review, 28, pp. 238-256; Blanchard, B.S., Fabrycky, W.J., (2011) Systems Engineering and Analysis, , United States of America: Pearson; Damanpour, F., Organizational complexity and innovation: Developing and testing multiple contingency models (1996) Management Science, 42 (5), pp. 693-716; Danneels, E., The dynamics of product innovation and firm competences (2002) Strategic Management Journal, 23, pp. 1095-1121; De Meo, E., Industria alimentare e sistema innovativo in Puglia (2004) Politica Agricola Internazionale, pp. 1-2; Gaspersz, V., Fontana, A., (2011) Malcolm Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence, , Bogor: Vinchristo Publication; Howard, M., Collaboration and the '3DayCar': A study of automotive ICT adoption (2005) Journal of Information Technology, 20, pp. 245-258; (2005) Statistiche sulla Ricerca Scientifica, , Istat, Istat, Roma; Jansen, J.J.P., Van Den Bosch, F.A.J., Volberda, H.W., Exploratory innovation, exploitative innovation, and performance: Effects of organizational antecedents and environmental moderators (2006) Management Science, 52 (11), pp. 1661-1674; Kendall, K.E., Kendall, J.E., (2006) Analisis Dan Perancangan Sistem, , Jakarta: Indeks; Lerici, C.R., L'innovazione nella moderna tecnologia alimentare (1996) Atti v Convegno Nazionale ANDID, , Positive Press Verona, Rimini; Levinthal, D.A., March, J.G., The myopia of learning (1993) Strategic Management Journal, 14, pp. 95-112; Lewin, A.Y., Long, C.P., Caroll, T.N., The coevolution of new organizational forms (1999) Organization Science, 10, pp. 535-550; Li, Y., Zhou, N., Si, Y., Exploratory innovation, exploitative innovation, and performance: Influence of business strategies and environment (2010) Nankai Business Review International, 1 (3), pp. 297-316; March, J.G., Exploration and exploitation in organizational learning (1991) Organization Science, 2, pp. 71-87; McGrath, R.M., (2013) The End of Competitive Advantage.

Goodyear Indonesia Tbk and its study in this paper provide the purposes to create a model of the Master Production Schedule (MPS). The mentioned MPS complies with company policy, production capacity and supply received. From view point of Industrial Engineering, there are needs for forecasting method effectiveness toward the company production capacity. Furthermore, from view point of Information Systems, there are needs to provide the MPS as compare to prior systems that was done manually resulting in the frequent error at the time of making MPS deductible. Several Methods are used and considered, such as: The method of time series, Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), the calculation of production capacity, MPS, and designing information systems. By having the combination of views from Industrial Engineering and Information Systems perspective the improvement can be conducted from both theoretical development and its managerial implications. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Industrial Engineering; Information Systems; Master Production Schedule (MPS); Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).; Mean Square Error (MSE)","Company policies; Forecasting methods; Indonesia; Managerial implications; Master production schedule; Mean absolute percentage error; Production capacity; Theoretical development; Industrial engineering; Information systems; Manufacture; Optimization; Production control; Mean square error",,,,,"Baroto, T., (2002) Perencanaan Dan Pengendalian Produksi.; Bertrand, J.W.M., Rutten, W.G.M.M., Evaluation of three production planning procedures for the use of recipe flexibility (1999) European J.

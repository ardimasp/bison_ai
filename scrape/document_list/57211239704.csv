To secure the house, the occupants of the house will always have the door locked. However, sometimes the house occupants forget to lock the door due to hurry when leaving the house, or they may doubt whether they have locked the door or not. We propose an application called Door Security System which is based on Android using Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor the status of the door, controlling the door and increasing security in a house. MQTT cloud is utilized as the communication protocol between smartphone and door lock system. PIR sensor is implemented in the door lock to detect the movement near the door, while touch sensor is installed on the door handle to recognize the human hand. Should the door is opened by force, the alarm will ring and send notification to alert the house occupant on the existence of intruder in the house. The evaluation results show that motion detection sensor can detect movement accurately up to 1,6 meters ahead, and messages published between smartphone and door lock are encrypted properly so messages are safely sent. © 2019 The Authors.

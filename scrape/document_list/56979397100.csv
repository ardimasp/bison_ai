The proposed algorithm is based on a state machine string matching algorithm. The experiment is done using data geared for Network Intrusion Detection System which use snort rules and some network packet file captured for research purpose. The research results show that the proposed multicharacter string matching algorithm is faster but consume more memory against the tested single character string matching algorithm. © 2016 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Algorithm; Multi pattern string matching; Multi-character string matching; Software",,,,,,,"Hasib, S., Motwani, M., Saxena, A., Importance of Aho-Corasick String Matching Algorithm in Real World Applications (2013) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technologies, pp. 467-469; Patel, B., Deterministic Memory-Efficient String Matching Algorithms for Intrusion Detection (2014) International Journal of Computer Engineering and Sciences; Aho, A.V., Corasick, M.J., Efficient string matching: An aid to bibliographic search (1975) Magazine Communications of the ACM, pp. 333-340; Rasool, A., Tiwari, A., Singla, G., Khare, N., “String Matching Methodologies:A Comparative Analysis (2012) (IJCSIT) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technologies, 3 (2), pp. 3394-3397; Lin, C.-H., Tsai, S.-Y., Liu, C.-H., Chang, S.-C., Shyu, J.-M., Accelerating String Matching Using Multi-threaded Algorithm on GPU (2010) Proc.

By using this technology, Learning Management System (LMS) can provide an unimpeded interaction for their users and promote awareness for any information updates. It is crucial to develop mobile application for each major mobile platform to reach most of the LMS user. In this paper, the mobile application development was done by combining native mobile technology and web technology using WebView API. This approach was taken to anticipate the need for creating and maintaining the application on multiple mobile platform and was expected to cut development time frame while retaining consistent interface and still enable platform specific's feature usage. The purpose of this study is to review the strengths and weaknesses of such combination in mobile application development specifically under android platform. © 2015 The Authors.

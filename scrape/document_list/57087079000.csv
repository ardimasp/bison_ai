The adoption of International Accounting Standards (IAS) 24 “Related Party Disclosures” in Indonesia in 2011 had required disclosures about key management compensation, which was not required by the previous standard. The research was conducted by examining the top 100 listed companies’ data that ranged between 2011 and 2014. Our findings suggest that institutional ownership and firm size are positively associated with the disclosure level of management compensation. We also found that the proportion of independent audit committee was negatively associated with the level of management compensation disclosure. Finally, we found no evidence that the audit quality had affected the level of management compensation disclosure. Our research has shed light on the determinants of management compensation disclosure in an emerging country with a two-tier board system where arguably the financial reporting environment is opaquer than the more developed countries. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Audit Committee; IAS 24; Institutional ownership; Management compensation",,,,,,"We appreciate the funding support from Academic Leadership Grant of Universitas Padjadjaran for this research and comments from the reviewer and audience in the 5th International Conference on Management, Hospitality, Tourism and Accounting (IMHA) Conference 2018.

Specifically, prior studies provide evidence that gender-based difference in diligence, conservatism and risk tolerance, it is plausible that female auditors may improve audit quality. Indonesia provides a valuable research setting to investigate the issue, as it is mandatory to disclose the identity of the audit partners in the audit reports. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs multivariate regression model to test the hypothesis, which examines the association between accruals quality and audit partners gender. Using a sample of Indonesian publicly listed firms, we run a panel of regression of audit quality measure proxied by abnormal accruals on female auditor variable and firm-specific controls. To triangulate the results, we also conduct sensitivity analysis using high and low category of abnormal accruals, an alternative measure of accruals quality (i.e. Beneish's M score) and propensity score matching (PSM). Findings: We find that firms with female audit engagement partners are not associated with smaller abnormal accruals, thereby implying that female auditors may not constrain effects on earnings management. In other words, gender is not an important predictor for audit quality in Indonesia. Research limitations/implications: We are not able to use broader measures of audit quality such as GAAP violations/restatement, litigation or audit fee. This is because the Indonesian setting somewhat limits us to collect them due to lack of regulatory actions and/or database availability. Practical implications: This study will contribute to the regulators (such as Financial Service Authorities/OJK) and professionals, on the effectiveness of female audit partners in improving audit quality. The study can be used as an evidence to support the gender equality in the accounting and audit industry. Social implications: Our findings suggest that auditor gender does not lead to the improvement of accruals quality in Indonesia. Given the fact that only 14% of firms in our sample audited by female audit partners, it is plausible that the positive traits of female top managers may not transmit to the overall audit process. As such, it is important to encourage more female involvement in top position of auditing and accounting industry is required to advance the profession and its positive impact to the society. Originality/value: There are no prior studies in Indonesia examining the effect of audit partner gender on accruals quality using archival data. As such, this research will be the first to document such evidence and therefore can improve our understanding on the role of auditor characteristic on audit quality. We also respond to the call from DeFond and Zhang (2014) to push analysis of audit quality to the individual auditor level by examining the gender of audit partner. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Abnormal accruals; Audit report; Discretionary accruals; Female audit partner",,,,,,"We acknowledge helpful feedback from Ersa Tri Wahyuni and two anonymous referees.

Using an event study analysis, we found some evidence that EY-Indonesia clients had a significantly positive market reaction compared to the none EY-Indonesia clients in regard to the news of the PCAOB sanction. The results indicate that the remedial effects of EY's actions taken after the sanction outweigh the negative effects. The results of this study are robust if compared to the abnormal returns for EY-Indonesia clients versus other Big 4 clients. This study is important to highlight the positive effects of the PCAOB sanction and monitoring to improve the audit quality in a developing market. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Audit quality; Auditor reputation; EY-Indonesia; Indosat; Market reaction; PCAOB sanction",,,,,,"The authors wish to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika journal team that help publish this article.","Abbott, L.

This study empirically examines such influences on taxpayers’ perceptions of tax compliance (either voluntary or enforced) in Indonesia after the implementation of a tax amnesty. In 2018, data were collected through a face-to-face questionnaire survey of 410 small business taxpayers and analyzed using a stepwise linear regression model. Trust in government was positively related to agreement with/support of voluntary tax compliance; however, perceptions of government’s power were only marginally significant. Neither trust in government nor perceptions of government’s power influenced taxpayers’ perceptions of enforced tax compliance. These findings partly support the Slippery Slope Framework. This study contributes to the literature on the influence of trust and power on voluntary or enforced tax compliance in developing countries, particularly Asia, after the implementation of a tax amnesty. © The Author(s) 2020.","enforced tax compliance; government’s power; Slippery Slope Framework; trust in the government; voluntary tax compliance",,,,,"Binus University: RT/III/2018, 014/VR","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Bina Nusantara University (Grant 014/VR.RT/III/2018).","Allingham, M.G., Sandmo, A., Income tax evasion: A theoretical analysis (1972) Journal of Public Economics, 1 (3-4), pp. 323-338. , https://doi.org/10.1016/0047-2727(72)90010-2; Alm, J., A perspective on the experimental analysis of taxpayer reporting (1991) The Accounting Review, 66 (3), pp. 577-593; Alm, J., What motives tax compliance?

Furthermore, economic studies on cryptocurrency are limited. This research presents a pioneering study investigating cryptocurrencies contagion in the Asian financial markets. We use three methods of measuring contagions. The first method adjusts the bias in the correlation coefficient. The second method identifies exceedances (extreme return) and performs a multinomial logistic regression to explain the coexceedances. Finally, we also use a vector autoregression (VAR) system. We documented evidence that the (unadjusted) correlation coefficients between five cryptocurrencies and thirteen Asian financial markets tended to be low in both high and low variance periods. After adjusting the bias in the correlation coefficient, we found that there was no longer evidence of a significant change in the magnitude of the propagation mechanism from five cryptocurrencies to Asian foreign exchange and stock markets. Using a multinomial logit analysis, we also acknowledged that cryptocurrencies tended to be statistically insignificant determinants for both positive and negative coexceedances. Our third contagion analysis using a VAR system further revealed that cryptocurrencies tended to be statistically insignificant determinants explaining the current Asian financial market change variables. Our results suggest that cryptocurrencies do not possess a systemic risk to the Asian financial markets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Contagion; Cryptocurrencies; Multinomial logit; Systemic risk; Vector autoregression",,,,,,"We would like to thank seminar participants at the 2nd International Conference on Knowledge Management Systems (ICKMS2019) at University of Houston, Texas, participants at the Bina Nusantara (BINUS) University accounting and finance workshop, and two anonymous reviewers who provide valuable comments and suggestions to improve the quality of the manuscript.","Aizenman, J., Jinjarak, Y., Lee, M., Park, D., Developing countries’ financial vulnerability to the Eurozone crisis: an event study of equity and bond markets (2016) J.

This research aims to reveal the factors affecting the decision to apply a cost model instead of fair value. Using logit model regression from 96 Indonesia listed companies during 2013-2015, this study tests if firm characteristics (i.e., size, profitability, leverage and growth), ownership (i.e., institutional ownership and family shareholders) and industry type (real-estate or non-real estate) influence firms’ decision to use cost model or fair value for investment property. Three business practitioners from the listed real estate company were also interviewed to gain a deeper understanding on the accounting policy decision. Results from regression analysis have shown that profitable firms and firms in real estate industries are more likely to apply cost model than fair value model for investment property. On the other hand, firms with a high percentage of institutional investors and higher growth are less likely to use the cost model. Results from interviews have revealed that the taxation complexity has been the main reason to avoid the fair value model. Respondents also have mentioned the volatility risk and owner’s conservatism as other reasons for avoiding fair value model. © 2019, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

Our results suggest that the increment to deferred tax balances upon adopting the balance sheet approach has value relevance, with such value relevance driven by the deferred taxes on certain asset revaluations (specifically, property, plant and equipment, and equity-accounted investments). We interpret our results as reflecting investors' preference for the balance sheet approach to deferred tax accounting and their view that deferred taxes on asset revaluations are real liabilities.

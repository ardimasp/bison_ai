There is a need for the application of a risk management information system for information asset security and has to be designed to identify risks and problems that exist at the online learning especially. Information system risk assessment must be watched out for because it can threaten the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of online learning activity and through this qualitative research which uses the OCTAVE ALLEGRO framework, critical assets can be identified together with the proposed prevention approach. © 2019 IEEE.","information system; octave allegro methodology; risk Assessment; risk management","E-learning; Information systems; Information use; Learning systems; Risk assessment; Risk management; Case-studies; Critical asset; Information assets; octave allegro methodology; Online learning; Online learning activities; Qualitative research; System risk assessment; Information management",,,,,"Ahmad, D., Jakaria, R., Dirgahayu, T., Hendrik, (2013) Manajemen Risiko Sistem Informasi Akademik Pada Perguruan Tinggi Menggunakan Metode Octave Allegro, , STMIK DCI, Teknologi Industri; Alberts, C., Dorofee, A., (2013) OCTAVESM Threat Profiles, , Software Engineering Institute Carnegie Mellon University; Alberts, C., Dorofee, A., Stevens, J., Woody, C., (2003) Introduction to the OCTAVE®.

The research methodology is that would be used is literature, collect data sample and data analysis. Method collected data sample with observation and questionnaire. Method data analysis using factor analysis. Method the results obtained from this study is the analysis of new factors and indicators that can be used as a basis for determining that the effect of a successful ERP implementation. Data obtained from questionnaires to 120 respondents in Ministry of Finance unit. Data can be processed from the 92 questionnaire respondents. Data were analyzed using reliability and factor analysis method after that proceed by using regression analysis. Results obtained in the form of a new model that can be used by the Finance Ministry is to evaluate the success of ERP Systems implementation. By using the new model of successful ERP System Implementation evaluate this, we can determine the minimum and maximum values that affect the successful of ERP system implementation to make a reference to improvement and development process of the system for the better system ahead. © 2018 IEEE.","enterprise resources planning; evaluation; factor analysis; regression analysis; successful system implementation","Data handling; Factor analysis; Finance; Information analysis; Information management; Multivariant analysis; Regression analysis; Reliability analysis; Surveys; Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems; Enterprise resources planning; Erp system implementations; ERP systems implementations; evaluation; Factor analysis method; Research methodologies; System implementation; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,"Chou, D.C., Tripuramallu, H.B., Chou, A.Y., BI and ERP integration (2005) Information Management & Computer Security, 13 (5), pp. 340-349; Jayawickrama, U., Yapa, S., Factors affecting ERP Implementations: Client and consultant perspectives.IBIMA Publishing (2013) Journal of Enterprise Resource Planning Studies, , http://www.ibimapublishing.com/journals/JERPS/jerps.html.2013, 2013), Article ID 227873 13; Tambovcevs, A., Tambovceva, T., (2013) ERP system implementation: Benefits and economic effectiveness.

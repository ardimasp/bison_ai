It makes the company is too late to provide the strategy decision. This also results inefficient way because the updating and changing SQL query to be adjusted for matching the requirements of decision makers. So, this paper describes how to implement the data warehouse technology to create the fastest way to make a report based on the requirements without customize the SQL query and just read the required data only. with Kimball methodology, data could be reported in various forms and the decision makers could take the best decision in eProcurement System. © 2018 IEEE.","business intelligence; Data warehouse; kimball; procurement system; report","Citrus fruits; Competitive intelligence; Data warehouses; Information analysis; Best decision; Decision makers; E-procurement systems; kimball; procurement system; report; SQL query; Strategy decision; Decision making",,,,,"Dedic, N., Stanier, C., An evaluation of the challenges of multilingualism in data warehouse development (2016) International Conference on Enterprice Information Systems-ICEIS, 18; Clerk Maxwell, J., (1892) A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, 3rd Ed., 2, pp. 68-73. , Oxford: Clarendon; Snijders, C., Matzat, U., Reips, U.-D., ""Big Data"": Big gaps of knowledge in the field of internet science (2017) International Journal of Internet Science, pp. 1-5; Elissa, K., Title of Paper if Known, , unpublished; Marz, N., Warren, J., (2015) Big Data: Principles and Best Practices of Scalable Realtime Data Systems, , Manning; Kamki, J., (2017) Digital Analytics: Data Driven Decision Making in Digital World, , Notion Press; Murphy, S.N., Avillach, P., Bellazi, R., Phillips, L., Gabetta, M., Eran, A., McDuffie, M.T., Kohane, I.S., Combining clinical and geonomics queris using i2b2-Three methods (2017) PloS One, , Dsds; Abelló, A., Romero, O., Pedersen, T.B., Berlanga, R., Nebot, V., Aramburu, M.J., Simitsis, A., Using semantic web technologies for exploratory OLAP: A survey (2015) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 27 (2), pp. 571-588; Kimball, R., Ross, M., (2016) The Kimball Group Reader: Relentlessly Practical Tools for Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence Remastered Collection 2, , ed.

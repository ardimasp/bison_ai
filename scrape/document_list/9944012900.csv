Ethereum token (ERC-20) can tokenize any real-world object while it is also possible to exchange the token across the network participants. This utility from the token drives many blockchain enthusiasts to create decentralized applications. ERC-20 token could be used to collect project funds, decision voting, or even can be used to provide investment platforms for people that want to hedge the volatility of the currency with buying an asset that is back to back with the crypto-token. This research shows the main characteristics of asset-backed token and its implementation on a complete end-to-end “digitalization assets system” (assets buy and assets redemption). The result shows that asset-backed token needs support from government and other legalizing parties to verify the legitimacy of the asset that backing the token itself. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Asset-backed token; Blockchain; ERC-20; Ethereum; Token","Ethereum; Financial markets; Fintech; Commodity exchange; End to end; Real-world objects; Blockchain",,,,,,,"Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System; Konstantinidis, I., Siaminos, G., Timplalexis, C., Blockchain for business applications: a systematic literature review (2018) Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, pp. 384-399. , Springer International Publishing; Rosati, P., Čuk, T., (2019) Blockchain beyond cryptocurrencies.

However, the local governments can only use the plans from the central government. The negative effects of this, among others, are improper land use allocation, lack of facilities, and crimes that are difficult to handle. This study proposes a geographic information system (GIS)-based method to analyze the proper central business district in Karawang, a small district in Java, Indonesia. Multi-criteria analysis of factors affecting the candidate locations was used through a weighted sum method in a model. The spatial data were retrieved and analyzed using a GIS tool to classify region into urban, peri-urban, and rural. Some central business locations have been found after reclassification which is located near the toll gates. Two locations in the north of Karawang were classified have the potential to become the new central business locations. © 2020 IEEE.","Extended Urbanization; Peri-Urban; Reclassification; Spatial Data Analysis; Weighted Sum Method","Land use; Location; Candidate locations; Central business districts; Central government; Land use allocation; Local government; Multi Criteria Analysis; Spatial data; Weighted sum method; Geographic information systems",,,,,,,"Steiner, F., (2008) The Living Landscape-An Ecological Approach to Landscape Planning-Second Edition, , Washington DC: ISLAND PRESS; Williams, K., Burton, E., Jenks, M., (2000) Achieving Sustainable Urban Form.pdf, , E & FN Spon, New York; (2015) Habitat III Issue Papers-Public Space, , UN United Nation Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development; Mardiansjah, F.H., Extended urbanization in smaller-sized cities and small town development in Java: The case of the Tegal Region (2020) Iop Conf.

A central research topic is how to stimulate learning and improve the quality of questions for learning evaluation by generating relevant questions with objective of learning and cognitive skill levels. This study presents an automated question generating method based on keyphrase to improve learning system in such way that the generated questions comply with both predetermined learning outcomes and Bloom's taxonomy of hierarchical cognitive skill levels. Unlike the prominent methods, this study proposed the learning materials written in local languages transformed into English which make the method applicable to learning material written in various languages given the language translation to English is available. In addition, the expert knowledge about keyphrase patterns in this study is represented in a set of context-free grammar rules making it possible to extend the pattern's rules to capture various keyphrase structures. The study which used 1,432 sentences from learning material written in Bahasa Indonesia can generate about 60,000 questions. From the experimentation, the average of Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score which is computed from the generated questions is 0.9566. This result indicates that the generated questions are well understood by human assessors. From sentiment analysis results, the generated questions achieve 0.73 classified as neutral, and 0.68 classified as objective. The Cohen-Kappa coefficient of 0.34589 means there is a difference between human evaluators in understanding the generated questions. © 2020 ICIC International.

This paper presents a hybrid user-collaborative, rule-based filtering recommendation system for education context. User profiles are represented by learning outcome scores and contextual information. The user-collaborative filtering method is used for predicting the targeted student’s learning outcome of a particular course. The predicted learning outcome combined with a set of decision rules are used for recommending some relevant link of learning materials to the targeted student. The initial contextual information which is assessed during the online program entrance test makes it possible for the proposed recommneder system to give automated recommendations to new students. The proposed method was tested using student learning outcome records from BINUS Online repository data. The results of performance evaluation of both recommender system with contextual information which achieves 458.22 MSE and the recommender system without contextual information which achieves 413.19 MSE are not significantly different. However, unlike the latter recommender system, the former recommender system has an advantage mainly that it can be used to give recommendation to the targeted students since their early program stage. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Collaborative filtering; Contextual information; Multi-criteria; Online learning; Recommendation system",,,,,,,,"Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: A survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions (2005) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 17 (6), pp. 734-749; Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., (2015) Context-Aware Recommender Systems, pp. 191-226. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4899-7637-6_6, Second ed., Recommender systems handbook; Aher, S.B., Lobo, L.M.R.J., Course (2012) Recommender System in E-Learning, 3 (1), pp. 159-164; Anandakumar, K., Rathipriya, K., Bharathi, A., A Survey on methodologies for personalized (2014) E-Learning Recommender Systems, pp. 4738-4743; Benhamdi, S., Babouri, A., Chiky, R., Personalized recommender system for E-learning environment (2017) Education and Information Technologies, 22 (4), pp. 1455-1477; Bozzon, A., Prandi, G., Valenzise, G., Tagliasacchi, M., A music recommendation system based on semantic audio segments similarity (2008) Proceedings of the IASTED International Conference on Internet and Multimedia Systems and Applications and Visual Communications, pp. 182-187; Cami, B.R., Hassanpour, H., Mashayekhi, H., (2017) A content-based movie recommender system based on temporal user preferences, pp. 121-125. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPIS.2017.8311601; Collins, A.D., Tkaczyk, A., Aizawabeel, J., (2018) A Study of Position Bias in Digital Library Recommender Systems, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06565, February; Corbi, A., Burgos, D., Review of current student-monitoring techniques used in ELearning-focused recommender systems and learning analytics.

To enhance the model performance, the efforts implemented include optimizing the training process by applying sliding-windows methods and setting appropriate parameters. After obtaining the best settings, the proposed model was then compared with two other variants of the LSTM model, namely Vanilla LSTM and Stack LSTM. The model performance evaluation was done by finding Mean Square Error (MSE) and root mean square error values from training and testing process. The results show that there were increased performances from using sliding-windows method to optimize the training process and the appropriate parameter setting. Bidirectional LSTM model, along with the treatments implemented, gave the best performance compared to the two other models.

The complexity of the software can increase the possibility of defects. Defective software can cause high losses. Fixing defective software requires a high cost because it can spend up 50% of the project schedule. Most software developers don't document their work properly so that making it difficult to analyse software development history data. Software metrics which use in cross-project software defects prediction have many features. Software metrics usually consist of various measurement techniques, so there are possibilities for their features to be similar. It is possible that these features are similar or irrelevant so that they can cause a decrease in the performance of classifiers. In this study, several feature selection techniques were proposed to select the relevant features. The classification algorithm used is Naive Bayes. Based on the analysis using ANOVA, the SBS and SBFS models can significantly improve the performance of the Naïve Bayes model. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bayesian networks; Defects; Feature extraction; Sodium compounds; Classification algorithm; Development history; Measurement techniques; Performance of classifier; Relevant features; Selection techniques; Software defect prediction; Software developer; Software design",,,,,,,"Adak, M.F., Software defect detection by using data mining based fuzzy logic (2018) 2018 Sixth Int.

The dataset used consisted of 93,000 pairs of questions. Data were trained repeatedly with a percentage of dataset 80:20 and classified using six levels in bloom's taxonomy and based on vector embedding. The results of this study prove that the encoder-decoder model with attention produces better and easier questions than other models. Evaluation of the question-producing system by comparing the two activation functions, namely hyperbolic tangential and sigmoid, shows that the sigmoid function can reduce the value of the loss function to 0.001, which means it can minimize the error factor. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Its wide applications in many research fields have motivated many researchers to propose a plethora of clustering algorithms. K-medoids are a prominent clustering algorithm as an improvement of the predecessor, K-Means algorithm. Despite its widely used and less sensitive to noises and outliers, the performance of K-medoids clustering algorithm is affected by the distance function. This paper presents experimentation findings to compare the performance of K-medoids clustering algorithm using Euclidean, Manhattan and Chebyshev distance functions. In this study the K-medoids algorithm was tested using the village status dataset from Gorontalo Province, Indonesia. Execution time and Davies Bouldin Index were used as performance metrics of the clustering algorithm. Experiment results showed that methods of Manhattan distance and Euclidean distance with the Index Davies value of 0.050. © 2020 IEEE.","Clustering; Euclidean dan Chebyshev; K-Medoids; Manhattan; Village Status","Green manufacturing; Industrial internet of things (IIoT); Davies-Bouldin index; Distance functions; Euclidean distance; K-medoids algorithms; K-medoids clustering; Manhattan distance; Observation data; Performance metrics; K-means clustering",,,,,,,"Lloyd, S.P., Least squares quantization in PCM (1982) IEEE Trans.

However, recognizing credit card fraudulent transaction is still an open problem despite many methods have been proposed. The main problems, among others, are imbalanced nature of the credit card transaction data and no agreed upon features to represent the transaction. This paper presents a novel approach to address such problem by exploiting card user spending behavior as the main feature to represent the transaction. in our experiment with Random forest we put max features parameter value 18 and 75 as number of trees in Random forest. While our experiment with OCSVM is by using 4 different kernels which are RBF, Polynomial, Linear and Sigmoid, and, we tuned nu and gamma parameter to get the optimal precision, recall and AUC for our Classifier. The experiment results found that One-Class SVM model achieve 0.984 AUC for training and 0.985 AUC for testing; whilst, Random Forest model achieves 0.991 AUC for training and 0.943 AUC for testing. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Efficient solution for both tasks depended on remote sensing technology to capture and analyze remotely sensed data of the region of interest. Although a plethora of methods for land cover classification have been reported, the problem remained a challenging task in computer vision field. The advent of deep learning method in the past decade has been very instrumental to develop a robust method for land cover classification using satellite imagery as input. The objective of this paper was to present empiric results on using CNN as a land cover classifier model using Sentinel-2 spatial satellite imagery. Prior to model training, the input image representation was extracted using eCognition to produce texture, brightness, shape, and vegetation index. Land cover labeling followed the Land Cover Class in Medium Resolution Optical Imagery Interpretation document provided by Indonesian National Standardization Agency. The training of CNN model achieved 0.98 mean training accuracy and 0.98 mean testing accuracy. As comparison, the same data and same feature were trained with another model: Gradient Boosting Model (GBM). The results revealed that the training accuracy and testing accuracy with GBMs were 0.98 and 0.95 respectively. CNN model showed small improvement of the accuracy to classify land cover with the image feature (NDVI, Brightness, GLCM homogeneity and Rectangular fit). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","CNN; Land cover classification; Satellite imagery",,,,,,,,"Weng, Q., Mao, Z., Lin, J., Liao, X., Land-use scene classification based on a CNN using a constrained extreme learning machine (2018) Int.

The increasing popularity of online learning in recent years has given momentum to automated question generation in education field for facilitating learning process, learning material retrieval, and computer-based testing. This paper report on the development of question generation framework based on key-phrase method for online learning with a constraint that the generated questions should comply with the learning outcomes and skills from Bloom’s Taxonomy. The proposed method was tested using learning materials of Software Engineering course for undergraduate level written in Bahasa Indonesia obtained from Bina Nusantara’s (Binus’s) Online Learning repository. Using one-semester lecture material, this study generated 92,608 essay-type questions from 6-level Bloom’s Taxonomy which were further sampled randomly to obtain 120 question samples for method evaluation. Performance evaluation using average Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) involving five independent reviewers toward samples of these questions achieved 0.921 and 0.6 Cohen’s Kappa. The relevance of Bloom’s Taxonomy level of the generated questions was evaluated by means of classification model with 0.99 accuracy. The results indicate that not only are the generated questions well understood and agreed by the reviewers, they are also relevant to the expected Bloom’s Taxonomy level there for the questions can be delivered to students in the respected course delivery and evaluation. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bloom’s taxonomy; Context-free grammar; Keyphrase extraction; Question generation; Question template",,,,,"049 / LL3 / PG / 2020","This research was supported partially by the Directorate General of Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Indonesian Higher Education, as part of the Research Doctoral Dissertation Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Generating Questions Automatically in Online Learning Using Encoders-Decoders Using Attention” with Contract number: 049 / LL3 / PG / 2020.",,"Adamson, D., Bhartiya, D., Gujral, B., Kedia, R., Singh, A., Rosé, C.P., Automatically generating discussion questions (2013) In AIED, pp. 81-90. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_9; Al-Yahya, M., OntoQue: A question generation engine for educational assesment based on domain ontologies (2011) Proceedings of the 2011 11Th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies, ICALT 2011, pp. 393-395. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ICALT.2011.124, IEEE; Bloom, B.S., (1956) Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals; Chao, Z., Li, L., The combination of context information to enhance simple question answering (2018) Proceedings - 2018 5th international conference on behavioral, economic, and socio-cultural computing, BESC 2018, pp. 109-114; Diab, S., Sartawi, B., Classification of questions and learning outcome statements (LOS) into Bloom’s taxonomy (BT) by similarity measurements towards extracting of learning outcome from learning material (2017) International Journal of Managing Information Technology, 9 (2), pp. 01-12; Divate, M., Salgaonkar, A., Automatic question generation approaches and evaluation techniques (2017) Current Science, p. 113(9); Duan, N., Tang, D., Chen, P., Zhou, M., Question generation for question answering (2017) In EMNLP 2017 - Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Proceedings, pp. 877-885. , https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/d17-1090; Elsahar, H., Gravier, C., Laforest, F.F., Zero-shot question generation from knowledge graphs for unseen predicates and entity types (2018) NAACL-HLT, Abs/1802.0, pp. 218-228. , https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/n18-1020; Emu, I.H., Ahmed, A.U., Islam, M., Al Mamun, S., Uddin, A., An efficient approach for Keyphrase extraction from English document (2017) International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications, 9 (12), pp. 59-66; Gan, W., Yu, X., Automatic understanding and formalization of natural language geometry problems using syntax-semantics models (2018) ICIC International, 14 (1), pp. 83-98; Gleason, N.W., (2018) Higher education in the era of the fourth industrial revolution; Graesser, A.C., Rus, V., Cai, Z., Hu, X., Question answering and generation (2009) Applied Natural Language Processing: Identification, Investigation and Resolution, 1, pp. 1-16; Han, H., Yang, F., Huang, J., Zhou, B., CFXGBoost: Topic phrase extraction based on context features and XGBoost for knowledge base question answering (2018) ICNC-FSKD 2017 - 13Th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery, pp. 2397-2402. , https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2017.8393148, IEEE; Heilman, M., Smith, N.A., Good question!

More specifically, debit card transaction data from a private Indonesian bank were categorized into fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. Training and testing datasets were then analyzed. Due to its architectural similarity, this study explores the learning performance of an AC-GAN Discriminator model and compares it with the learning performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, as a baseline model. The experimental results illustrate that the training and testing accuracy of the AC-GAN discriminator model (i.e., 81.1% and 93.0%, respectively) outperformed the CNN model (i.e., 68.1% and 67.7%). Given the similar structures of AC-GAN discriminators and CNN models, it is hypothesized that AC-GAN discriminators can perform better than CNNs. This is because the effect of the adversarial training approach embedded up-sampling techniques into the model-training process. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Improvement of motivation and enjoyment could be influenced by player personality. As there is a variety of personalities, gamification application developers should consider including various gameplay to adapt with each personality type. There is a need for adaptive gamification framework. This paper intends to propose an adaptive gamification framework with proper player classification and effectiveness evaluation method. This paper focuses on introducing gamification framework by combining adaptive gameplay, dynamic difficulty adjustment, Big Five personality model, player performance, and evaluation method to measure player motivation and enjoyment to see the effectiveness of gamification applications such as IMMS and eGameFlow.

Educational institutions that provide open networks and connected to many devices simultaneously become an exciting testing ground for cybercriminals. Anti-virus is often used as prevention by applying signature-based detection of specific tiles contained in the database. Unfortunately, because much new malware continues to grow, the detection of the database becomes inaccurate. Therefore, automatic detection has been carried out using Autoencoder hybridized with ANN and CNN approaches. It will be developed using Python programming language with computer specification of 16GB RAM and Processor i7-7500U. Samples used are malware dataset obtained from various types of repositories such as virussign.com, the Zoo, and certain libraries from researchers. The dimensions of samples will be reconstructed using Autoencoder to generate new values that will be used as input on ANN and CNN. This research also has been developed Principal Component Analysis as a comparison architecture. Those approaches provide outstanding results in detecting malware, scilicet PCA-ANN with an accuracy of 0.985, PCACNN with an accuracy of 0.963, Autoencoder -ANN with an accuracy of 0.994, and Autoencoder -CNN with an accuracy of 0.970. Therefore, those approaches can be used as reference in increasing the need for educational institutions to improve their security from malware by detecting tiles that will be sent or read by each user. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial;

Software defect dataset usually imbalanced because it contains far more the not defected modules than the defected modules. Class imbalances in the dataset can reduce the performance of classifiers in the software defect prediction model. In this study proposed a Random Undersampling algorithm to balance classes and ensemble techniques to reduce misclassification. The ensemble technique used is the AdaBoost and Bagging algorithm. The results showed that the software defect prediction model that integrates the Random Undersampling algorithm and AdaBoost provides better performance and can find more defects than other models. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,,"Aleem, S., Capretz, L.F., Ahmed, F., Benchmarking Machine Learning Techniques for Software Defect Detection (2015) Int.

Despite it might be caused by various errors during the data collection or transportation, some anomalies potentially give important information such as indication of a new underlying process. The aim of anomaly detection task is to determine all such instances in the input dataset in a data-driven fashion. In the past decade, the proliferation of anomaly data in many domains have raised research interest resulted in a plethora of anomaly detection methods A vast number of previous study reports suggested that there is no single model will achieve the best performance for every dataset. This paper presents empiric results on the effect of several kernel functions to performance of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) as an anomaly detector model. The proposed model is tested using financial transactions of microfinance service dataset from an Indonesian Bank. The empiric results showed that OC-SVM model with Sigmoid and RBF kernels achieve the best statistically significant value of training, validation, and testing accuracies than the OC-SVM model with no-kernel, linear kernel and polynomial (degree 3,4,5,6) kernels. © 2019 IEEE.","anomaly detection; kernel; one-class support vector machine","Support vector machines; Anomaly detection methods; Anomaly detector; Data collection; Detection performance; Financial transactions; One-class support vector machine; Research interests; Testing accuracy; Anomaly detection",,,,,,,"Hawkins, D.M., Atkinson, A.C., Hawkins, D.M., (1980) Identification of Outliers, 37 (4). , Dordrecht Springer Netherlands; Chandola, V., Banerjee, A., Kumar, V., Anomaly detection: A survey (2009) ACM Comput.

Some constraints might be too wide for a metaheuristic algorithm, e.g. particle swarm optimization, to allocate the candidate locations outside a wide constraint. However, particle swarm optimization notably has fast computation characteristic and many researchers used this method for optimizing their spatial data. In the other hand, genetic algorithm has not only better exploitation-characteristic performance in searching but also has mutation and crossover that was proven in this study can be overcome the wide constraint problem. To minimize the drawback of genetic algorithm, i.e. need many computation resources, the hybrid particle swarm optimization with genetic algorithm through the use of crossover and mutation was used. Half of lower fitness values from particle swarm optimization were optimized using crossover and mutation in genetic algorithm. After merging the results of both methods, the optimum location showed that the proposed method was able to allocate the land use in a case study area outside the wide constraint. © 2019 IEEE.","exploitation; exploration; meta-heuristic; spatial data optimization; wide constraint problem","Land use; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Algorithm for solving; Candidate locations; Computation resources; Constraint problems; Crossover and mutation; Fast computation; Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization; Meta heuristic algorithm; Genetic algorithms",,,,,,,"Khalili-Damghani, K., Aminzadeh-Goharrizi, B., Rastegar, S., Aminzadeh-Goharrizi, B., Solving land-use suitability analysis and planning problem by a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm (2014) Int.

Fall detection method is needed to minimized the problem when human fallen and smartphone can be used as the device to detect it. Usually people carry smartphone in any positions and can make fall detection method difficult to detect when fall occurs. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) combined with Sigmoid helps to answer the challenge to handle smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope data in many smartphone orientation position. LSTM method on this experiment can achieved 91.67% for the accuracy result. Since the fall data occurs rarely and there may be insufficient data available, the gamification prospect implemented in fall detection application especially on 'Bug' bounty can help researcher to enhance the accuracy result to make a better human fall detection method. © 2019 IEEE.","accelerometer;

In education context, automated logo detection and brand name recognition from digital image or video are very crucial as a learning tool to achieve learning outcomes. One technical issue in the logo detection and brand name recognition is its requirement to develop model that achive fast recognition speed and high recognition accuracy. One-stage detector is a breakthrough and innovative object detection framework; however, long duration and computing power required to carry out training and detection processes using the backbone deep architecture are often considered to be the challenge of this framework. The objective of this study is to propose a novel ResNet variant models using ResNet-50 as the basis. The empiric results showed that the model 2 achieved 0.408 mAP, the best average accuracy with training time 1.41 hour. The original Resnet50 model, in contrast, achieved 0.556 mAP average accuracy with 1.91 hour training time. The detection testing of the proposed Model 2 model was 23.47 fps, while the detection testing of Resnet50 model was 29.33 Fps. © 2019 IEEE.","Logo Detection; One Stage Detector; Resnet50","Brand recognition; Deep architectures; Detection framework; Detection process; Fast recognition; Learning outcome; Logo detections; Recognition accuracy; Object detection",,,,,,,"Liao, Y., Lu, X., Zhang, C., Wang, Y., Tang, Z., Mutual enhancement for detection of multiple logos in sports videos (2017) Proc.

To allocate land use properly, the zoning method has been widely used, especially in densely populated cities, namely a kind of sustainable urban form with considers the mix of use/diversity of land use to minimize travel distance. This study proposes a method for calculating how much a city meets the sustainable urban forms based on compact city criteria, i.e. compatibility, dependency, and compactness. After the survey filling in compatibility and dependency scores for each land use, and compactness was calculated for each sub-district. Fuzzy C-Means clustering was used to cluster the result to classify other areas.

Data from the satellite usually have lower accuracy than other expensive methods e.g. drone, aerial view, etc. However, the data from satellite have wide range area and sufficient enough for modeling a land use. The accuracy assessment, therefore, becomes a vital task to ensure the model from the satellite imagery meets the minimum requirement. Validating the classification result by comparing to the real location or by other higher resolution images is needed. The paper proposed additional validation by comparing the classification result by another result in different date through the cross-tabulation method. Two satellite imageries in the same year were processed before classification to get the land-use and land-cover classification. Comparing two land-use classified images gave the accuracy statistics using cross-tabulation. The kappa statistic and accuracy showed the classification performance of 0.7592 that similar to the sampling-based accuracy assessment (0.75390). Therefore, the proposed method was appropriate as the accuracy assessment. © 2019 IEEE.","cross-tabulation; kappa statistic; land-use classification; satellite imagery","Antennas; Land use; Satellite imagery; Accuracy measurements; Classification performance; Classification results; cross-tabulation; Higher resolution images; Kappa statistic; Land-use and land cover classifications; Landuse classifications; Image classification",,,,,,,"Handayanto, R., Tripathi, N.K., Kim, S.M., Herlawati, H., Land use growth simulation and optimization for achieving a sustainable urban form (2018) TELKOMNIKA (Telecommunication Comput.

The data for this study were collected by recording many sample units from each of the following human activity categories: stand-fall, walk-fall, stand-jump, stand-sit, stand, and walk. Several time-series data captured by the sensors were used as human motion features. One of the challenges of this study was the existence of human body motions whose features resembled those of body falls. In addition, unfixed smartphone positioning made human body falls harder to detect and can lead to high rate of misclassification (not detected as fall). This incident can caused serious bone fracture or even death if the person not handled as immediately as possible because of misclassification. To address this problem, we modified Resultant Acceleration and ∠ Y formulas to address the problem of unconstrained smartphone positions. We proposed to combine five methods such as AGVeSR, Alim, ∠α, GyroReDi, and AGPeak to build a robust detector model to reduce the misclassification. The experiment results showed that the accuracy of the combination of both sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) outperformed the accuracy of accelerometer only by more than 15%. The decision fusion that used voting involving five methods could boost the accuracy rate by up to 4.15%. © BEIESP.","Accelerometer; Gyroscope; Human fall detection; Unconstrained smartphone positions",,,,,,,,"de la Concepción, M.Á.Á., Morillo, L.M.S., García, J.A.Á., González-Abril, L., Mobile activity recognition and fall detection system for elderly people using ameva algorithm (2017) Pervasive and Mobile Computing, 34, pp. 3-13;

The EA supports achieving organizational goals because of its functions. This paper discusses the results of literature review for the EA function. There are at least three reasons for using EA in organizations: its complexity, external force to change, and the alignment of business with Information Technology (IT). Furthermore, this paper also discusses how the EA functions can offer benefit for the Village Law. The Village Law is a legal product in Indonesia that is used as a legal umbrella to build Indonesia.

Ovarium cancer consists of benign and malignant type. Based on the data set obtained, this research try to classify the data set with support vector machine algorithm. The principle of SVM is how to identify a hyperplanes with maximal margin. Hyperplanes is a border line between the data. Here, we will used two kernel function in SVM, linear and polynomial kernel function. Next We will compare both of them algorithm to reach the hyperplanes with maximal margin. The hyperplanes then used to predict the class of data testing given. Finally, comparation result will be obtained from confussion matrix and accuration calculation for each kernel function while used to classify the ovarium cancer data set. Accuration result with Linear kernel function is 68.98% for first schema and 66.67% for second schema. Then accuration result with Polynomial Kernel Function is 83.79% for both of schema. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Diseases; Geometry; Polynomials; Support vector machines; Cancer classification; Cancer disease; Data testing; Kernel function; Linear kernel functions; Maximal margin; Polynomial kernels; Support vector machine algorithm; Classification (of information)",,,,,,,"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarium-cancer, access at january 2017; Usman, K., Kaship, R., Brain Tumor Classification from Multi Modality MRI UsingWavelets and Machine Learning (2017) Pattern Analytics Application, 20 (3), p. 871; Samosir, R.S., Filtering and Wavelet Transform Algorithm for Old Document Image Restoration (2017) Computer, Mathematics and Engineering Application, 8 (3), pp. 177-181; Megha, P.A., Ram Mohana Reddy, G., An intelligent Content-Based Image Retrieval system for Clinical Decision Support in Brain Tumor Diagnosis (2013) International Journal Multimed Information Retrieval, 2 (3), pp. 175-188; Taranjit, K., Barjinder, S.S., Savita, G., A Novel Feature Selection Method for Brain Tumor MR Image Classification Based onThe Fisher Criterion and Parameter-Free Bat Optimization (2018) Neural Computing & Application, 29 (8), pp. 193-206; Chaddad, A., Automated Feature Extraction in Brain Tumor by Magnetic Resonance Image Using Gaussian Mixture Models (2015) J.

As a foundation to a broader study on smart LMS, this study focused on analyzing prominent study reports on recommender systems in general and online learning in particular. The SLR method analyzed papers published in the range of 2013-2018. Out of the 109 papers this study analyzed indepth 42 papers. The study findings confirmed that most of RS studies still focused on e-commerce, movies, tourists, and more whose most popular RS methods were collaborative filtering and content base. Some studies in RS for online education were mostly focused on scheduling, recommendations for courses, books, prospective students and others. The results of this study found that there are still much opportunities to develop methods and approaches for RS in online learning. This study findings gives foundation of our future research to develop a model of conscious contextual recommendation system using Machine Learning based on smart LMS for online learning. © 2018 IEEE.","distance learning; machine learning; online learning; Recommender System; smart LMS","Collaborative filtering; Distance education; Education computing; Electronic commerce; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Online systems; Recommender systems; Contextual recommendations; Learning management system; Literature reviews; NAtural language processing; On-line education; Online learning; smart LMS; Systematic literature review (SLR); E-learning",,,,,,,"Mothukuri, U.K., Improvisation of learning experience using Learning Analytics in eLearning, 2017; Za, O.R., (2002) Building a Recommender Agent for e-Learning Systems; Kong, X., Boll, S., Heuten, W., (2013) Towards Recommender Systems Supporting Knowledge Sharing and Transfer in Vocational Education and Training, pp. 25-30; Kumar, A., Open Problems in Recommender Systems Diversity, 2017, pp. 82-87; Salman, Y., Abu-Issa, A., Tumar, I., Hassouneh, Y., A model and prototype of a proactive multi-Type context-Aware recommender system 2017 Intell.

Many methods for face recognition such as holistic learning, the use of local features, shallow learning and deep learning, some methods are susceptible to variations in pose change, illumination, expression and age variation. State of the art of face recognition today is a deep learning technique that delivers high accuracy. In this paper author replicate an face recognition using deep learning architecture called OpenFace Convolutional Neural Network. In this research author make variation on the size of image, color dept and age, and see how that factor impact on accuracy of face recognition in that architecture. As the result from the research, the accuracy of a model depends on the image size, color depth, and age variation, but in OpenFace CNN that recognition still provides fairly good accuracy when reducing the size of image and color depth, as long as the image can still be detected on the landmark facial, so the alignment process can be done on the face image. © 2018 IEEE.","Age variant; Color Depth; Convolutional Neural Network; Face Recognition; Image Size","Color; Convolution; Deep learning; Network architecture; Neural networks; Age variant; Biometric authentication; Color depth; Convolution neural network; Convolutional neural network; Image Size; Learning architectures; Learning techniques; Face recognition",,,,,,,"Turk, M., Pentland, A., Eigenfaces for recognition (1991) J.

The chatbot model used is a cahatbot model across business/service fields. The training data used in this research are the data on customer service talks with its customers in several business fields or services. To compare the models generated from the LSTM algorithm and Simple RNN algorithm, two tests were carried out, the first test is testing the chat output manually which was done directly by humans and the second test are comparing the LSTM algorithm and Simple RNN algorithms using the same training data and test data. From the experimental results, it was found that the chat output generated by the LSTM algorithm relatively can answer most of the tests correctly rather than Simple RNN algorithm. From the experiment, it was also found that the learning process in the LSTM algorithm takes longer than the learning process on the Simple RNN algorithm. © 2018 IEEE.","Bahasa Indonesia; Chatbot; LSTM; RNN","Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Testing; Chatbot; Customer services; Indonesia; Learning process; LSTM; Simple recurrent neural networks; Test data; Training data; Long short-term memory",,,,,,,"Eason, G., Noble, B., Sneddon, I.N., On certain integrals of Lipschitz-Hankel type involving products of Bessel functions (1955) Phil.

The popularity of the game has raised the attention of many researchers from various research domains. But there are some problems in game design. One of these problems is a game adaptation that can be defined freely as the game's ability to adapt to various factors such as: gamer's skills, emotion playing, layer formats, and hardware platforms. The purpose of this paper is to propose a case-based reasoning (CBR)-based game architecture for designing adaptive text-based computer games that will be used as a delivery of high performance computing (HPC) learning. © 2018 IEEE.","Adaptive; case-based reasoning (CBR); Design; Game; High Performance Computing (HPC)","Case based reasoning; Design; Pattern recognition; Adaptive; Casebased reasonings (CBR); Game; Game architecture; Hardware platform; High performance computing; High performance computing (HPC); Research domains; Computer games",,,,,,,"Prasad, S.K., Chtchelkanova, A., Dehne, F., Gouda, M., Gupta, A., Jaja, J., Kant, K., Wu, J., (2012) NSF/IEEE-TCPP Curriculum Initiative on Parallel and Distributed Computing-Core Topics for Undergraduates, 55p. , www.cs.gsu.edu/-tcpp/curriculum/index.php, Version I,.

This comparison aims to find the most appropriate similarity coefficient for some cases. Many results found that Sorensen-dice coefficient and Jaccard coefficient is close or even identical. But Jaccard coefficient can not handle properly for sets with real-value or weighted sets or any pair of vectors. So, Jaccard coefficient redefined as Generalized Jaccard Coefficient. This paper shows the correlation between Sorensen-dice coefficient with Generalized Jaccard Coefficient using Spearman's correlation as predecessors research did and using ANOVA to ensure the results. This research find that the comparison between them is less similar from predecessors research. © 2018 IEEE.","comparison; Generalized Jaccard Similarity; rodent tuber; similarity coefficient; Sorensen-Dice Similarity","Software engineering; comparison; Generalized Jaccard Similarity; rodent tuber; Similarity coefficients; Sorensen-Dice Similarity; Pattern recognition",,,,,,,"Sianipar, N.F., Ariandana, Maarisit, W., Detection of gamma-irradiated mutant of rodent tuber (typhonium flagelliforme lodd) (2015) Vitro Culture by RAPD Molecular Marker, 14, pp. 285-294; Laurent, D., Sianipar, N.F., Chelen, L., Wantho, A., Analysis of genetic diversity of Indonesia rodent tuber (typhonium flagelliforme lodd.)

The increasing requirement toward safer human transportation that requires a robust weather prediction model has motivated the development of a vast number of weather prediction models. In the past decade, the advent of deep learning methods has opened up a new approach to weather prediction, mainly in two areas: automated learning hierarchical representation of weather data and robust weather prediction models. This paper presents a method for automatic feature extraction from weather time series data using Autoencoder model. The learned weather representation was used to train Long Short-term Memory model as a prediction model or regressor. Although it can be used to predict many other weather variables, in this study, the proposed model was tested to predict temperature, dew point, and humidity. The results show that the model performance measured by training and testing RMSE values are as follows. Predicting temperature: AE90-LSTM model (0.00003, 0.00010) and predicting dew point: AE199-LSTM model (0.00005, 0.00010). Interestingly, for predicting humidity 100LSTM model (0.00004, 0.00001) and AE100-LSTM model (0.00001, 0.00008) achieved almost similar performance. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Autoencoder; Long Short-term memory; Weather prediction","Brain; Database systems; Deep learning; Long short-term memory; Meteorology; Auto encoders; Automated learning; Automatic feature extraction; Hierarchical representation; Human transportation; Training and testing; Weather prediction; Weather prediction model; Weather forecasting",,,,,,,"Wikipedia Contributors: Weather Forecasting, , https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Weather_forecasting&oldid=868621761, Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, Accessed 8 Nov 2018; Santhanam, M.S., Patra, P.K., Statistics of atmospheric correlations (2001) Phys.

Despite its high accuracy, the model was not practical when high computing power was not available. Thus, deep model with not-so-deep structure or less number of model parameters is needed for low capacity computer. Logo and brand recognition task is an important and challenging problem in computer vision with wide potential applications. The inherent challenge to address this task is not only due to the presence of logo in various direction and clutters as well as imbalanced dataset but also because of high computing workload when deep learning models were adopted. This paper presents empirical results of logo recognition method using MiniVGGNet and MiniGoogleNet models combined with augmentation technique to increase variation and number of samples. The results show that the proposed model combined with augmentation technique increased accuracy of model accuracies and fasten training convergence of both models. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Augmentation technique; Logo detection; MiniGoogLeNet; MiniVGGNet","Database systems; Marketing; Augmentation techniques; Brand recognition; Computing workloads; Imbalanced dataset; Logo detections; MiniGoogLeNet; MiniVGGNet; Number of samples; Deep learning",,,,,"Acknowledgment.

It is still considered a very important preventive measure of cardiovascular disease as it gives a significant impact to reducing mortality rates and cardiovascular events. Prior to developing a prediction model of cardiovascular risk, identification of dominant predictor variables is very crucial. Some prominent studies have proposed a vast number of predictor variables. Although some predictor variables might be universal in nature, as the premise of this study, some of the variables might be associated with local lifestyle that governs patient behavior. This paper presents a verificative study on previous studies predicting cardiovascular risk level by using Indonesian adult patients’ lab records as the input dataset. In relation to this objective, this study aimed to select dominant biochemical indicators as predictor variables and trained machine learning models as classifier. Finally, this study compared the performance of several prominent classifier models such as: XGBoost, Random Forest, k-NN, Gradient Boosting, Artificial Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron), Decision Tree, and Ada Boost. The results show that: XGBoost model achieved the best training and testing accuracy (0.965 and 0.964) compared to Random Forest (0.964 and 0.962), 5-NN (0.952 and 0.948), Gradient Boosting (0.948 and 0.940), Artificial Neural Networks (0.945 and 0.933), Decision Tree (0.861 and 0.860) and Ada Boost models (0.748 and 0.718). © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cardiovascular risk prediction; Machine learning","Data mining; Database systems; Decision trees; Forecasting; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Biochemical indicators; Cardio-vascular disease; Cardiovascular event; Cardiovascular risk; Machine learning models; Predictor variables; Preventive measures; Training and testing; Machine learning",,,,,,,"Rovio, S.P., Cardiovascular risk factors from childhood and midlife cognitive performance: the Young Finns Study (2017) J.

The level of similarity then we validated using a lecture note. This research is a continuation of the research that we are currently doing related to the development of smart LMS with one of the supporting features of the recommendation system. Using the analysis in the forum log post discussion of this research was carried out through several stages. The first stage, the random selection of 5 classes taken by the forum data, the second stage, carried out text mining analysis from the posts of students and lecturers, the third stage, analyzing text validation using lecture notes that have been used as data sets in the form of corpus. This study uses the doc2v algorithm with vectorization. The results of this study found that the percentage of similarities between lecturers' posts, students and lecture notes only reached 49% of the target we expected at least 80%. Because discussion forums are a substitute for face-to-face sessions on face-to-face learning. On the other hands this study found that the similarity of discussion between lecturers and students on discussion forums had a significant influence on student learning outcomes (assignment) and this reinforces the need for a system of recommendations for online learning. © 2018 IEEE.","Log forum discuss; Online learning; Recommendation system; Smart LMS; Text mining analysis","Data mining; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Online systems; Recommender systems; Students; Degree of similarity; Face-to-face learning; Log forum discuss; Online learning; Random selection; Smart LMS; Student learning outcomes; Text mining analysis; E-learning",,,,,,,"Wan, S., Niu, Z., An e-learning recommendation approach based on the self-organization of learning resource (2018) Knowledge-Based Systems, 160, pp. 71-87; Pawar, A., Mago, V., (2018) Calculating the Similarity between Words and Sentences Using a Lexical Database and Corpus Statistics, , arXiv preprint; Medeiros, E.A.S., De Menezes, F.G., Guerra, C.M., Batista, R.E.A., Perdiz, L.B., Angelieri, D.B., E-learning practices on healthcare associated infections (hai): Report of brazilian experience (2008) Am J Infect Dis, 4 (4), pp. 232-236; Jabr, M.A., Al-Omari, H.K., E-learning management system using service oriented architecture (2010) J Comput Sci, 6 (3), pp. 285-295; Hirzallah, N., An authoring tool for as-in-class e-lectures in e-learning systems (2007) Am J Appl Sci, 4 (9), pp. 686-692; Limongelli, C., Lombardi, M., Marani, A., Sciarrone, F., Temperini, M., A recommendation module to help teachers build courses through the moodle learning management system (2016) New Rev Hypermedia Multimed; Alfalah, T.F., Alfalah, S.F., Falah, J.F., Qutaishat, W., Ishretih, W., Al-Zu'bi, M., Learning management system versus social networking sites (2017) Int Bus Res; Naveh, G., Shelef, A., Let the learning management system grow on you-the effect of experience on satisfaction (2018) Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing; Phongphaew, N., Jiamsanguanwong, A., Usability evaluation on learning management system (2018) Adv Intell Syst Comput; Wiley, D.A., The instructional use of learning objects(1) (2002) Bloomington, In: Agency for Instructional Technology; Tohti, T., Zhao, Y., Musajan, W., (2017) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1 (887), pp. 1-7. , Word2vec and Dictionary Based Approach for Uyghur Text Filtering; Hearst, M.A., Text data mining: Issues, techniques, and the relationship to information access (1997) Presentation Notes for Uw/Ms Workshop on Data Mining, , July 1997; Feldman, R., Dagan, I., Knowledge discovery in textual databases (kdt (1995) Proceedings of the First International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (kdd-95), pp. 112-117. , Montreal, Canada, August 20-21, aaai Press; Fayyad, U., Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Smyth, P., From data mining to knowledge discovery: An overview (1996) Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1-36. , U.

One of them is research on how to EEG to detect the condition of eyes with two-dimensional eyes closed or open. By using the public data set of the status of the eye, this paper aims to investigate whether the location of the electrode affects the quality of accuracy, precision, recall and area under the curve (AUC). To process data, the author uses a rapid miner device. The location of the electrodes observed were three areas, namely the left side of the brain (AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1), the right side of the brain (AF4, F4, FC6, F8, T8, P8 and O2) and all parts of the brain (AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, F4). The classification model, which is used, is logistic regression (SVM). Observations of data taken from electrodes in all parts of the brain are higher compared to data taken from electrodes on the left and right sides. For classification with the left side, the accuracy rate is 55.98%, the precision level is 64.03%, the level of 4.41% and AUC is 0.611%. For the classification with the right side, the accuracy rate is 55.13%, the precision is 50.67%, the level is 1.88%, and the AUC is 0.587%. For all parts of the brain is 58.71%, 79.14% precision, Recall is 10.91% and AUC is 0.618 © 2018 IEEE.","Classification; EEG; Emotiv Epoc+; Eye State; Logistic regression (SVM)","Classification (of information); Electrodes; Electroencephalography; Regression analysis; Support vector machines; Area under the curves; Classification models; Emotiv epoc; Eye State; Logistic regressions; Mechanical device; Special needs; State classification; Brain computer interface",,,,"Lembaga Penelitian dan Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat, LPPM","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research is supported by Institute for Research and Community Services, Sekolah Tinggi Teknik PLN (STT-PLN).

Moreover, the AOI-HEP data mining technique has been improved with confidence mining pattern into two terms, where firstly give confidence mining pattern for each AOI-HEP pattern either frequent or similar pattern. Secondly, give confidence for each dataset as confidence AOI-HEP pattern between frequent and similar patterns. Confidence for each AOI-HEP pattern will show how interested each of AOI-HEP pattern between frequent and similar pattern, whilst confidence per dataset will show how interested each dataset between frequent and similar pattern. In this paper the mining of AOI-HEP has been extended to mine AOI-HEP association rules using the current AOI-HEP frequent pattern, since association rule deal with frequent pattern. Based from previous experiments upon 4 UCI machine learning datasets such as adult, breast cancer, census and IPUMS, there are 9 finding AOI-HEP frequent patterns where 8 from adult and breast cancer datasets respectively. Finally, there are 2 and 1 AOI-HEP association rules from adult and breast cancer datasets respectively. © 2018 IEEE.","AOI-HEP; Association rule; Confidence; Data Mining; frequent pattern","Association rules; Diseases; Learning systems; AOI-HEP; Attribute oriented induction; Breast Cancer; Confidence; Emerging patterns; frequent pattern; Mining associations; Similar pattern; Data mining",,,,,,,"Warnars, S., Attribute oriented induction of high-level emerging patterns (2012) Proceeding of the IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing (IEEE GrC), pp. 525-530. , Hangzhou, China; Warnars, S., Mining frequent pattern with attribute oriented induction high level emerging pattern (aoi-hep) (2014) Proceeding of IEEE the 2nd International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (IEEE ICoICT 2014), pp. 144-149. , Bandung, Indonesia; Warnars, S., Attribute oriented induction high level emerging pattern (aoi-hep) future research (2014) Proceeding of IEEE the 8th International Conference on Information & Communication Technology and Systems (ICTS), pp. 13-18. , Surabaya, Indonesia; Warnars, S., Mining frequent and similar patterns with attribute oriented induction high level emerging pattern (aoi-hep) data mining technique (2014) International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Computational and Applied Sciences (IJETCAS), 3 (11), pp. 266-276; Agrawal, R., Imieliski, T., Swami, A., Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases (1993) SIGMOD Rec, 22 (2), pp. 207-216; Agrawal, R., Srikant, R., Fast algorithms for mining association rules (1994) Proceeding of 20th International Conference on VLDB, pp. 487-499; Srikant, R., Agrawal, R., Mining quantitative association rules in large relational tables (1996) Proceeding of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data (SIGMOD '96), pp. 1-12; Dong, G., Zhang, X., Wong, L., Li, J., J.

Although formal study on weather forecasting has been started since 19th century, research attention to weather forecasting tasks increased significantly after weather big data are widely available. This paper proposed merged-Long Short-term Memory for forecasting ground visibility at the airpot using timeseries of predictor variable combined with another variable as moderating variable. The proposed models were tested using weather timeseries data at Hang Nadim Airport, Batam. The experiment results showedthe best average accuracy for forecasting visibility using merged Long Short-term Memory model and temperature and dew point as a moderating variable was (88.6%); whilst, using basic Long Short-term Memory without moderating variablewasonly (83.8%) respectively (increased by 4.8%).

This customers' movement is a major issue for companies as the reason most often found why customer churn. Churn management is an important program for companies to maintain valuable customers thus predicting customer churn is crucial. In literature, churn analysis has been widely studied with a various churn analysis techniques. These techniques mostly utilize customer complaint data, customer tenure, customer usage, customer payment behaviour, etc. This paper employs customer opinions from Twitter with some specific keyword. We investigate whether measurements of collective sentiment (mood) states about a product, extracted from Twitter feeds, are correlated to the value of the churn rate of the observed product. This study examines the text content of daily Twitter feeds by Convolution Neural Network that measures positive, negative or neutral sentiment. Cross-validate the resulting mood time series with Granger causality analysis was conducted. A Recurrent Neural Network was then used to test the hypothesis that mood states from Twitter are predictive of changes in churn rate values. The results indicate that the accuracy of churn rate predictions can be improved by the inclusion of specific mood dimensions, that is negative sentiment, but not others. The Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) is about 1.47%. © 2017 IEEE.","Broadband Internet; Churn Rate; Convolutional Neural Network; Granger Causality Analysis; Multivariate timeseries; Recurrent Neural Network; Twitter Opinion Mining","Convolution; Data mining; Multivariant analysis; Recurrent neural networks; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Statistical tests; Time series analysis; Broadband Internet; Churn rates; Convolution neural network; Convolutional neural network; Customer complaints; Customer payments; Granger causality analysis; Negative sentiments; Sales",,,,,,,"Adriani, M., Asian, J., Nazief, B., Tahaghoghi, S.M., Williams, H.E., Stemming Indonesian: A confix-stripping approach (2007) ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing (TALIP), 6 (4), pp. 1-33. , Dec 1; Bengio, Y., Gingras, F., Recurrent neural networks for missing or asynchronous data (1996) InAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 395-401; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8. , Mar 31; Dahiya, K., Bhatia, S., Customer churn analysis in telecom industry.

Doing DW to your systems should apply to the mother knowledge of AI which we recognized as Software Engineering (SE) where we should apply best software application in more importantly we should satisfy the user. In order to make a good DW model design as user expectation then we should apply 3 steps such as collect all the needed reporting, order all the reports start from the most needed reports and mapping all the ordered reports into fact constellation schema.

The emerging deep learning techniques in the last decade coupled and the wide availability of massive weather observation data have motivated many researches to explore hidden hierarchical pattern in the large volume of weather dataset for weather forecasting. The purposes of this research are to build a robust and adaptive statistical model for forecasting univariate weather variable in Indonesian airport area and to explore the effect of intermediate weather variable related to accuracy prediction using single layer Long Short Memory Model (LSTM) model and multi layers LSTM model. The proposed forecasting model is an extension of LSTM model by adding intermediate variable signal into LSTM memory block. The premise is that two highly related patterns in input dataset will rectify the input patterns so make it easier for the model to learn and recognize the pattern from the training dataset. In an effort to achieve a robust model for learning and recognizing weather pattern, this research will also explore various architectures such as single layer LSTM and Multiple Layer LSTM (4 layers LSTM). The dataset is weather variable data collected by Weather Underground at Hang Nadim Indonesia airport. This research used visibility as predicted data and temperature, pressure, humidity, dew point as intermediates data. The best model of LSTM in this experiment is multiple layers LSTM and the best intermediate data is pressure variable. Using the pressure variable this model has gained the validation accuracy 0.8060 and RMSE 0.0775. © 2018 The Authors.

One of the important weather data in aviation is visibility. Visibility is an important factor in all phases of flight, especially when the aircraft is maneuvering on or close to the ground, i.e., during taxi-out, takeoff and initial climb, approach and landing and taxi-in. The aim of these study is to analyze intermediate variables and do the comparison of visibility forecasting by using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Model. This paper proposes ARIMA model and LSTM model for forecasting visibility at Hang Nadim Airport, Batam Indonesia using one variable weather data as predictor such as visibility and combine with another variable weather data as moderating variables such as temperature, dew point and humidity. The models were tested using weather time series data at Hang Nadim Airport, Batam Indonesia. This research compares the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) resulted by LTSM model with the RMSE resulted by ARIMA model. The results of this experiment show that LSTM model with/or without intermediate variable has better performance than ARIMA Model. © 2018 Afan Galih Salman, Yaya Heryadi, Edi Abdurahman and Wayan Suparta.","Autoregressive integrated moving average; Long Short-Term Memory; Root mean square error; Visibility; Weather forecasting",,,,,"Binus University","This research is supported by Doctoral of Computer Science, Bina Nusantara University.",,"Afshin, S., Fahmi, H., Alizadeh, A., Kaveh, F., Long term rainfall forecasting by integrated artificial neural network-fuzzy logic-wavelet model in Karoon basin (2011) Scientific Res.

The premise of this research is fraudulent transaction contains 'anomaly' from the pattern of non-fraudulent transactions so that the anomalous pattern can be detected and separated at some point using classification models. Less availability dataset for research, non-stationary distribution of the data, highly imbalanced class distributions, and continuous streams of transactions become the main driven of using CHAID and k-NN classification method. Empiric result using actual debit card transaction using ATM services shows that Accuracy of CHAID model is 0.8 and F = 0.7; and k-NN model (for k=3) is 0.7 and F = 0.6 These results are comparable to previous studies using Hidden Markov Models. © 2016 IEEE.","CHAID; debit card fraud recognition; k-NN","Classification (of information); Crime; Hidden Markov models; Markov processes; CHAID; Classification models; Debit cards; Fraudulent transactions; Imbalanced class; K-nearest neighbors; K-NN classifications; Transaction records; Nearest neighbor search",,,,,,,"Case, P., Sisat, S.N., (2014) Secured Automatic Teller Machine (ATM).

The emerging deep learning techniques in the last decade coupled with the wide availability of massive weather observation data and the advent of information and computer technology have motivated many researches to explore hidden hierarchical pattern in the large volume of weather dataset for weather forecasting. This study investigates deep learning techniques for weather forecasting. In particular, this study will compare prediction performance of Recurrence Neural Network (RNN), Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (CRBM), and Convolutional Network (CN) models. Those models are tested using weather dataset provided by BMKG (Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics) which are collected from a number of weather stations in Aceh area from 1973 to 2009 and El-Nino Southern Oscilation (ENSO) data set provided by International Institution such as National Weather Service Center for Environmental Prediction Climate (NOAA). Forecasting accuracy of each model is evaluated using Frobenius norm. The result of this study expected to contribute to weather forecasting for wide application domains including flight navigation to agriculture and tourism. © 2015 IEEE.","conditional restricted boltzmann machines; convolutional networks; deep learning; recurrent neural network; Weather","Climate models; Climatology; Convolution; Forecasting; Information systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Recurrent neural networks; Weather information services; Weathering; Conditional restricted boltzmann machines; Convolutional networks; Deep learning; Environmental prediction; Forecasting accuracy; Hierarchical patterns; National Weather Services; Prediction performance; Weather forecasting",,,,,,,"Chen, S.-M., Hwang, J.-R., Temperature prediction using fuzzy time series (2000) Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics IEEE Transactions on, 30 (2), pp. 263-275; Maqsood, I., Khan, M.R., Abraham, A., An ensemble of neural networks for weather forecasting (2004) Neural Computing & Applications, 13 (2), pp. 112-122; Kwong, K.M., Liu, J.N.K., Chan, P.W., Lee, R., Using LIDAR Doppler velocity data and chaotic oscillatory-based neural network for the forecast of meso-scale wind field (2008) 2008 CEC 2008 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence).

This research also examines the effect of PCA for dimensional reduction to k-NN performance. The empiric results show that k-NN classifier achieves the highest accuracy (99.8 percent) for k=3 when the pattern is represented by full dimensional feature. However, k-NN classifier only achieves 28.6 percent accuracy (for k=5) when the pattern is represented by PCAreduced dimensional feature. This low accuracy is due to several factors, among others, is the presence of high numbers of redundant or highly correlated features among ASL alphabet that makes PCA unable to separate data. Although kNN classifier accuracy is higher than the proposed classifier in [7], recognition time of k-NN classifier is longer than that of the method proposed in [7]. Therefore, k-NN classifier is suitable for early child education-based application such as self-assessment system for special need student who learns ASL alphabet finger-spelling. © 2015 IEEE.","finger-spelling recognition","Computational linguistics; Education; Nearest neighbor search; Palmprint recognition; Text processing; American sign language; Dimensional reduction; Finger spelling; Highly-correlated; K nearest neighbours (k-NN); K-nearest neighbors classifiers; Recognition methods; Recognition time; Classification (of information)",,,,,,,"Puente, A., Alvarado, J.M., Herrera, V., Fingerspelling and sign language as alternative codes for reading and writing words for Chilean deaf signers (2006) American Annals of the Deaf, 151 (3), pp. 299-310; Murakami, K., Taguchi, H., Gesture recognition using recurrent neural network (1991) Proc. of SIGCHI Conf. on Human Factors in Computing Systems: Reaching Through Technology, pp. 237-242. , ACM New York; Kadous, M.W., Machine recognition of auslan signs using powergloves: Towards large-lexicon recognition of sign language (1996) Proceedings of the Workshop on the Integration of Gesture in Language and Speech.; Tarchanidis, K.N., Lygouras, J.N., Data glove with a force sensor (2003) IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, 52 (3), pp. 984-989; Starner, T., Weaver, J., Pentland, A., Real-time American sign language recognition using desk and wearable computer based video (1998) Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on, 20 (12), pp. 1371-1375; Jung-Bae, K., Park, K., Bang, W.-C., Bien, Z.Z., Continuous gesture recognition system for Korean sign language based on fuzzy logic and hidden markov model Fuzzy Systems, 2002.

This research examines the performance of sliding window, hidden Markov Model (HMM) and conditional random field (CRF) as the first layer classifier to segment the input video into a sequence of motion primitive label. The second layer classifier is stochastic error-correcting context-free grammar, built based on dance master knowledge, to parse the sequence of labels, builds a parse tree, and computes the accumulated dance score. The dataset for this research is captured using one Kinect camera. The training dataset is: 212 samples of 12 motion primitive samples and seven videos of Pendet dance performance. From 5-fold cross-validation, accuracy of sliding window, HMM, and CRF are 0.63, 0.79, and 0.86 respectively. This result shows that CRF achieves higher performance as a dance motion primitive recognizer than HMM as proposed by [1]. The CRF model achieves 0.88 of accuracy when motion feature is all skeleton joint angular coordinates as proposed by [2] but increases to 0.93 if the motion feature is only upper-body joint coordinates. Stochastic error-correcting context-free grammar is chosen as dance choreography model. The experiment using synthetic sequence label with cost factor ci=1 and error-sequence labels up to 50 percent shows the grammar can tolerate the input label sequence error up to 25 percent. The experiment using Pendet dance performances show that the average dance score is 79.3. The low dance score is due to several factors including: dance skill variation, unstable basic gesture repetition, high cost contributed by replacing deletion and substitution of local error by insertion operation, duration variation due the absence of timing guideline of body part motions, and limited training dataset to capture possible basic gesture variations. © 2014 IEEE.","dance motion recognition and scoring","Consumer electronics; Formal languages; Hidden Markov models; Markov processes; Motion estimation; Random processes; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Angular coordinates; Choreography models; Computation complexity; Conditional random field; Dance motion recognition; Insertion operations; Joint coordinates; Synthetic sequence; Context free grammars",,,,,,,"Bobick, A.F., Ivanov, Y.A., Action recognition using probabilistic parsing (1998) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 1998.

In this research, a class of basic dance motions is modeled by a stochastic regular grammar (SRG), inferred from training dataset, in which key body poses that are learned from training dataset are selected as gesture primitives. To represent a dance motion, body pose of a dancer is represented by angular coordinate of 15 skeleton joints. This feature is later compacted into one-dimensional string of labels for grammar inference which makes the recognition process is considerably fast compared to statistical pattern classifier such as k-nearest neighbor (kNN). A single test using the learned grammar in average takes only about 5 ms compared to around 20s using kNN whilst the overhead time to build all grammars takes only about 3.4s. This compacting process, however, leads to information loss which is observed in slightly degraded recognition performance for low articulated motions but quite large degradation for high articulated dance motions. To overcome this, we investigate several reliable feature selection methods such as Sequential Feature Selection (SFS), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Heuristic Sequential Feature Selection (HSFS) compared to the use of whole features. Based on our experiment, the HSFS is the most suitable feature selection to overcome this problem. © 2013 IEEE.","dance motion recognition; syntactic model","Computer science; Data processing; Information systems; Motion estimation; Pattern recognition; Principal component analysis; Stochastic systems; Syntactics; Computationally efficient; Dance motion recognition; Feature selection methods; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Recognition process; Sequential feature selections; Statistical pattern; Syntactic pattern recognition; Heuristic methods",,,,,,,"Nakazawa, A., Nakaoka, S., Ikeuchi, K., Yokoi, K., Imitating human dance motions through motion structure analysis (2002) Proceeding of the 2002 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, , EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland; Shiratori, T., Nakazawa, A., Ikeuchi, K., Detecting dance motion structure using motion capture and musical information (2004) Proc.

Although the motions are viewed as the main aesthetic factors, automatic recognition and verification of their kinesthetic elements using computer is a challenging problem. Numerous studies have been conducted on dance recognition from its kinesthetic elements, however, to the best of our knowledge, little is known on automatic annotation, clustering, recognition, and verification of Bali traditional dance elements. This paper presents a skeleton descriptor based on dynamic time warping which enables similarity measurement between two dance sequences that may vary in time and speed. Our experiments shown that a combination of a set of time-series descriptors and exponential data time warping distance achieved the highest clustering performance than other tested combinations. © 2012 IEEE.","Bali traditional dance; Kinesthetic element; Skeleton descriptor","Automatic annotation; Automatic recognition; Bali traditional dance; Descriptors; Facial Expressions; Kinesthetic element; ON dynamics; Similarity measurements; Time warping; Artificial intelligence; Eye movements; Musculoskeletal system",,,,,,,"Min, J., Kasturi, R., Activity recognition based on multiple motion trajectories (2004) Proc.

The mobile game is called Virtual Tribe. The Virtual Tribe game adopts the Persistent Browser Based Game (PPBG) into a J2ME application, and is combined with a Real Time Coordinating system. The game integrates Bluetooth to GPS connection using a JSR-82 J2ME library, HTTP Connection to server application PHP and online database. The game player acts as a tribal king in the game, and owns a virtual tribe which is located at the real earth coordinate where the player first registered the account. The player has to navigate and manage his virtual tribe and develop his tribe into a stronger and bigger civilization. The competition arises when one tribe decides to invade another's tribe in order to capture more lands. A winning condition included in the game rules, however, is that it is obvious that the biggest tribe will most likely rule the world of virtual tribe. The game has been tested using the Indonesia Internet Exchange (IIX) server, several types of Sonny Ericsson and Nokia mobile phones, and Holux M1000 GPS receiver.","Bluetooth; GPS; GPS receiver; J2ME; Mobile game; Mobile phone","Ericsson; Game players; Game rules; GPS receiver; GPS receivers; Indonesia; Internet Exchange; J2ME; Mobile games; Multiplayers; Online database; Real time; Server applications; Winning conditions; Bluetooth; Computer software; Global positioning system; HTTP; Human computer interaction; IPTV; Mobile phones; Animation",,,,,,,"(2008) Business, World of Phone - Dunia Ponsel, pp. 24-25. , Telkomsel Priority, Jakarta; (2007) POLL: Aside from Text and Voice Calls, What's the Most Frequent Activity You Do with Your Phone?, , http://www.cnet.com.au/forum/?mode=viewthread&t=10002116&tindex=0, Internet: March. 25, [ December 11, 2007]; (2007) Mobile Game, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_game, Internet: Dec. 13, [December 20, 2007]; Uhlir, K., Kurt Uhlir says the industry's lack of understanding of the complexities of location technology is holding back LBG (2005) Mobile Game Analyst, 3 (8). , http://www.igda.org/mobile/05-04Apr-29_Mobile_Game_Analyst_LBG_Article. pdf, Internet: April 20, April 1, http://www.igda.org/mobile/05-04Apr-29- Mobile-Game-Analyst-LBG-Article.pdf; (2007) Snake, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game), Internet: Dec. 13, [December 20, 2007]; (2008) Wargaming, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargaming, Internet: March 24, [ March 25, 2008]; (2008) Persistent Browser-Based Game, , http://www.pbbg.org/, Internet: March 25; (2008) Cybernations, , http://cybernations.net/, Internet: March 25; (2008) Cybernations Alliances, , http://cybernations.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Alliances, Internet: March 22, [March 25, 2008]; (2008) Java ME Technology API's & Docs, , http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis.jsp, Internet: February 12; (2007) Bluetooth, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bluetooth, Internet: Dec 14, [December 15, 2007]; (2007) Garmin Proprietary NMEA 0183 Sentence Technical, , http://www8.garmin.com/support/pdf/NMEA_0183.pdf, Internet: March [December 17, 2007]; How Does GPS Work?, , http://www.nasm.si.edu/gps.work.html, Internet: [December 16, 2007]","Colondam, S.M.; School of Computer Science, Jl.

The project is funded by IRPA (RM 445,000.00) for three years. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Computer simulation; Health care; Internet; Local area networks; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network protocols; Mobile ad hoc network; Smart tele-emergency project; Telemedicine",,,,,,,"Husni, E., (2001) Development of a Telemedicine System for Remote Areas in Sabah: Smart Tele Emergency Unit, , January; Johnson, D.B., Perkins, C., (2000) Mobility Support in IPv6, , April; Ernst, B., Castellucia, L., Mobile Networks Support in Mobile IPv6, , http://www.ietf.org, Internet 〈draft-emst-mobileip-v6-network-01.txt〉; http://www.6winit.org; Einsielder, H., Aguilar, R.L., The Moby Dick Project: A Mobile Heterogeneous All-IP Architecture, , http://www-int.berkom.de/~mobidick; Johnson, D.B., Mobility Support in IPv6, , http.//www.ietf.org, 〈draft-ietf-mobileip-ipv6-24.txt〉; Tseng, Y.C., Shen, C.C., Chen, W.T., Integrating mobile IP with ad hoc networks (2003) IEEE Computer, , May; Lamont, L., (2002) An IPv6 and OLSR Based Architecture for Integrating WLANs & MANET to the Internet, , IEEE; http://www.omnetpp.org; Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET) Charter, , http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/manet-charter.html","Husni, E.M.; School of Engineering and Information Technology, Locked Bag No. 2073, 88999 Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia; email: ehusni@yahoo.com","Ghodgaonkar D.K.Esa M.Lin A.Awang Z.Habash R.W.","IEEE Malaysia Section",,"2004 RF and Microwave Conference, RFM 2004","5 October 2004 through 6 October 2004","Selangor",66216,,078038671X; 9780780386716,,,"English","RF Microwave Conf.

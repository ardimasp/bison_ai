In running its business processes, PT Bank KEB Hana Indonesia promotes Information Technology (IT) to fulfill its vision, mission, and business objectives and operational services to customers. Therefore, IT governance needs to be implemented properly to provide good results for the company's achievements. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the maturity level of IT Governance at PT Bank KEB Hana Indonesia to measure IT governance in the core banking system development project. Evaluation was measured using the Process Assessment Model (PAM) of the COBIT 5 Framework which refers to 9 selected COBIT 5 processes namely EDM02, APO04, BAIO1, BAI02, BAI04, BAI05, BAI06, BAI08, and DSS03. Data collection used in this research is primary data obtained through interviews and questionnaires, and secondary data through observation stages. Data was analyzed with COBIT 5 Framework through 8 questionnaires retrieved from respondents using Rating Scale Formulas to find out the Capability Level scale for each Activity and Output in the selected COBIT 5 process. From the evaluation results, it is known that 9 processes are still at Level1 (Performed) where the results are still below the expected Capability Level, that is Level 4 (Predictable). So that the Gap Analysis obtained is 3, then the results are used to establish improvement recommendation based on Framework COBIT 5. © 2018 IEEE.","Capability Level; COBIT 5; IT Governance; Process Assessment Model (PAM)","Pattern recognition; Surveys; Business objectives; Capability Level; COBIT 5; Evaluation results; Improvement recommendations; IT governance; Operational service; Process assessments; Online systems",,,,,"Nengah, I.P., Adopted COBIT-5 framework for system design of Indonesia navy IS/IT: An evaluation (2017) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 12, pp. 6420-6427; Zandhessami, H., Hasan, M.K., Prioritization of COBIT framework processes based on sazehgostar saipa's information technology strategies (2011) Asian Journal of Management Research, 2; Fajrin, R.A., Perancangan Tata Kelola Teknologi Informasi di BAPAPSI Pemkab Bandung Menggunakan framework COBIT 5 Pada Domain EDM dan DSS (2016) Journal of Information Systems Engineering and Business Intelligence, 2; Firmansyah, D., Pengukuran Kapabilitas Pengelolaan Sistem Informasi Sub Domain Deliver, Service, Support 01 Menggunakan Framework Cobit 5 Studi Kasus: Politeknik Komputer Niaga LPKIA Bandung (2015) Konferensi Nasional Sistem & Informatika; Nugroho, H., Perancangan Model Kapabilitas Optimasi Sumber Daya TI Berdasarkan COBIT 5 Process Capability Model (2014) Jurnal Teknologi Informasi, 1; (2012) A Business Framework for the Governance and Management of Enterprise IT, , ISACA.

Therefore, it is a must to manage the documents. Automatic text summarization is able to solve by producing text document summaries. The goal of the research is to produce a tool to summarize documents in Bahasa: Indonesian Language. It is aimed to satisfy the user’s need of relevant and consistent summaries. The algorithm is based on sentence features scoring by using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Genetic Algorithm for determining sentence feature weights. It is evaluated by calculating summarization speed, precision, recall, F-measure, and some subjective evaluations. Extractive summaries from the original text documents can represent important information from a single document in Bahasa with faster summarization speed compared to manual process. Best F-measure value is 0,556926 (with precision of 0.53448 and recall of 0.58134) and summary ratio of 30%. © 2014, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

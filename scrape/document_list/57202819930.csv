With the recent rapid use of gamification for e-learning, an interesting open question for educators is, can it motivate and improve the achievement of students? The purpose of this study is to measure the effect of gamification on e-learning to support learning achievement and learning motivation. This is done by comparing the traditional learning method (class) and the method of e-learning gamification. The researcher will develop a prototype of e-learning gamification to support his research. There are several game mechanics conducted by researchers into e-learning such as, points, levels, challenges, and leaderboards. The data of this research were taken from the questionnaires distribution and the result of study report of 24 students in one of junior high school. Questionnaires were made into two kinds, pre-questionnaire and post-questionnaire respectively for traditional method and e-learning gamification. While the learning reports are obtained from student’s semester report and report during the use of e-learning gamification. The data is processed with the help of software SmartPLS v.3.2.6 and Microsoft Excel 2016 and analyzed using paired t-test. The results obtained are e-learning gamification does not give a positive effect or improvement on student motivation in terms of behavioral, emotional and cognitive. Futhermore, e-learning gamification also does not give a positive effect on improving student's learning achievement. The role of teacher and one time use of e-learning gamification are the causes that e-learning gamification does not give a positive impact. The challenge for further research is, how we substitute the teacher role. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","E-Learning; Game mechanics; Gamification; Learning achievement; Learning motivation",,,,,,"Februari).

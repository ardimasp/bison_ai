More and more people are aware of the environment for the next generation, the survival of mankind in the future. Sustainability issues are no exception in Indonesia. Companies publish sustainability reports as well as financial and annual reports. This sustainability report creates a need, namely the need for audits for sustainability reports. This is often referred to as a sustainability audit or assurance report. It is a qualitative descriptive survey. Researchers collect data from the literature and study observations as well as from interviews with stakeholders. The results of our study were obtained because the increasing number of public companies reporting on sustainability requires sustainability reporting audits in Indonesian public companies. The advantage of a sustainability audit report is that, in addition to its reputation or image, it can also add value to the company's planning, structure and accountability.

Audit delay causes financial statements to be inhibited for publication. This causes the users of financial statements to wait longer to be able to use financial statements as a tool in decision making. The purpose of this research is to empirically examine the effect of company size, liquidity, profitability, solvability, and audit firm size towards audit delay on property and real estate companies that listed on Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2014-2018. This research is a quantitative study that tests the hypothesis, whether there is the influence of independent variables on the dependent variable. This study uses the ordinary least square method Statistical test used is the coefficient of determination test, partial t test and simultaneous f test. The selection of research samples using purposive sampling method. The sample of this research consists of 46 companies with 5 years of research so total of the research objects amounting 230 data. The data analysis method used in this research is panel data regression analysis using E-views version 10. Based on the results of partial test, profitability and audit firm size have significant effect on audit delay. Company size, liquidity, and solvency do not have a significant effect on audit delay. Simultaneous test result showed that company size, liquidity, profitability, solvability, and audit firm size simultaneously affect audit delay. The results of this study indicate that if the auditor wants to minimize audit delay, they must pay more attention to clients' profitability and consider the size of the company, the size of the audit's scope of work. © BEIESP.","Audit Firm Size; Company size; Liquidity; Profitability; Solvability",,,,,,,"McKinnie, M., (2016) Cloud Computing: TOE Adoption Factors by Service Model in Manufacturing,”, p. 131; Kieso, T.D.D.E., (2011) J.

The purpose of this research is to design the right system or model for the detection of online business, or business transactions conducted in social media for the benefit of increasing tax revenue. Tracking and imposition tax must be worn by online business in social media, except the business into the marketplace such as, 'Tokopedia', 'Buka Lapak', 'Lazada'. Hitherto this research is conducted there is no single research that focus on this. Based on the Directorate General of Taxation this is an important issue and should be resolved soon, due to the increasingly widespread business through social media in Indonesia last 5 years. Therefore this research needs to be done to anticipate and solve the problem of research through system design model. This detection model is carried out in two stages, the first phase focused on the classification of social media users through the text mining process. The second stage is perfecting the detection of online business through the process model of Pattern Recognition. Therefore, the Indonesia's tax problem increase and complicated particularly in regards with the absence models for control system to increase income tax from online business tax payers, especially SMEs who the major usage social media as the way for a business transactions. This research uses experimental method. Data collection was taken from the social media users through cluster sampling technique, in this study the authors use social media Facebook as experimental data. The analysis associated with text mining is to create a variety of key words that aim to detect business transactions on Facebook. The second phase of analysis implements text mining results with data mining from the bank through design patterns based on time and nominal value. The results of this design model is expected to improve control system and tax revenue. © 2017 Serials Publications Pvt.

The methods of unstructured interviews with women working in Indonesian public accounting practices and a literature review on the issue of cultural and historical influences on Javanese women are used to contextualise this study. This paper finds that social norms were repeatedly mentioned as barriers to full professional engagement by the women interviewed. Firstly, the (historically and culturally informed) issue of what constitutes “proper” female behaviour was an issue. Secondly, and linked to the first point, the competing burdens of Javanese women’s expected domestic role versus the requirements of her profession was also raised as a block to women with families being able to be as committed to their profession as most of their male contemporaries. From the literature review, a third barrier, the lack of appropriate role models, was also found. No generalisability is claimed for this study. In particular, the interviews used as a basis for this article took place in Java and Indonesia is acknowledged to be a culturally diverse nation. ©2015 Australasian Accounting Business and Finance Journal and Authors.","Accounting; Barriers; Ideographic; Indonesia; Interviews; Java; Professions’ women",,,,,,,"Anwar, E., Directed’ Women’s Movement’s in Java: Social and Political Agency from within (2003) HAWWA, 2 (1), pp. 89-139. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156920804322888266; Bachtiar, E., (2001) The Professionalisation of Accounting in Java, , Osaka – Jepang, August 8-10; Birket, W.P., Evans, E., Theorising Professionalisation: A Model for Organising and Understanding histories of the Professionalising Activities of Occupational Associations of Accountant (2005) Accounting History, 10 (1), pp. 99-127. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/103237320501000105; Boyer, I., The Balance on Trial: Women’s Careers in Accountancy (1995) CIMA, , London; Burke, R.J., McKeen, C.A., Employment Gaps Work Satisfaction and Careers Advancement Among Women Chartered Accountants (1995) Journal Management Psychology, 10 (7), pp. 16-21. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/02683949510088746; Cameron, L., Women and the Labor Market During and After the Crisis (2002) Women in Java: Gender, Equity and Development, pp. 144-157. , In K.

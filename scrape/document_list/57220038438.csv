Some of automatic essay grader have been made using string kernel, word embedding and reinforced learning method. The objective of this research is to develop an application to help users in grading English digital essays. Grading is done based on 12 score features. Argumentative and narrative essays written by junior high school students are utilized as the dataset. By using XGBoost as the classifier, this research produces an automated essay grader with an average accuracy of 66.87%. Evaluation is conducted using 5-fold cross validation method. © 2019 IEEE.","Automated Essay Grader; Machine Learning XGBoost; NLTK; spaCy","E-learning; Grading; Learning systems; Reinforcement learning; 5-fold cross validation method; Junior high schools; Reinforced learning; String Kernel; Engineering education",,,,,"Guerra, P.H.C., Veloso, A., Almeida, W.M.J.V., From bias to opinion : A transfer-learning approach to real-time setiment analysis (2011) Proceedings of the 17th Acmsigkdd International Conferenceon Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 150-158; Page, E.B., The imminence of.

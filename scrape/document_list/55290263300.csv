Be it emotional, physical, intentional or unconscious, voice reveals the internal state of the speaker. Therefore, the main aim of the present study is to identify which voice parameter could be used as a reliable indicator of stress due to deception. For analyzing real life natural stress, the voice of crime suspects was recorded during ongoing interrogations at the police station. PRAAT software was used for analysis. Results indicated a significant increase in the mean fundamental frequency (F0) and formant frequencies F1, F2. Marginal decrease in jitter was observed, however, shimmer did not at all correlate to stress due to deception. Pitch contours indicated considerable rise in the pitch of crime suspects while answering specific direct questions. Thus, it was concluded that mean F0 and formant frequencies F1, F2 correlate strongly to stress. © 2016 IEEE.","detection of deception; fundamental frequency; jitter; pitch contour; shimmer; spectrogram; Voice stress analysis","Crime; Jitter; Natural frequencies; Stress analysis; Detection of deceptions; Fundamental frequencies; Pitch contours; shimmer; Spectrograms; Voice stress analysis; Speech recognition",,,,,"Scherer, K.R., (2000) The Neuropsychology of Emotion, Chapter Psychological Models of Emotion, pp. 137-162. , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Darwin, C., (1998) The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, , 3rd ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford 1872, reprint; DePaulo, B.M., Lindsay, J.J., Malone, B.E., Muhlenbruck, L., Charlton, K., Cooper, H., Cues to deception (2003) Psychological Bulletin, 129 (1), pp. 74-112; Masip, J., Garrido, E., Herrero, C., (2004) Defining Deception.

This paper presents a simplified and a non-invasive approach to detect psycho-physiological stress by monitoring the acoustic modifications during a stressful conversation. Voice database consists of audio clips from eight different popular FM broadcasts wherein the host of the show vexes the subjects who are otherwise unaware of the charade. The audio clips are obtained from real-life stressful conversations (no simulated emotions). Analysis is done using PRAAT software to evaluate mean fundamental frequency (F0) and formant frequencies (F1, F2, F3, F4) both in neutral and stressed state. Results suggest that F0 increases with stress; however, formant frequency decreases with stress. Comparison of Fourier and chirp spectra of short vowel segment shows that for relaxed speech, the two spectra are similar; however, for stressed speech, they differ in the high frequency range due to increased pitch modulation.

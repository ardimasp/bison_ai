The method used by the author is literature and field study. The author uses the field method to conduct interviews and conduct surveys to find supporting data that helps in the development of information systems portal community. Based on the results of the study, it was found that the designed community portal can help to know the business process of one of the existing community at this time, to help facilitate the community in managing new user candidates as well as old user and event data that has been going on and will take place and facilitate the community in doing storage and delivery of information to users quickly and accurately. © IAEME Publication.","Communities; Development; Information Systems; Online",,,,,,"Magazine, Y.O.T., (2014), www.youngontop.com/yotmagazine, November).

The benefits of this research for educators are expected to give feedback for them on the use of social media Facebook as a media for learning activities. The use of social media Facebook as a learning media will increase the motivation of non-regular students in learning activities. The main objective of this research is to analyze the impacts of the use of social media Facebook as a learning media for learning motivation of non-regular students. Method of data collection is use questionnaires given to 126 respondents to the category of non-regular students and the analysis of data using a single regression model. In this research, the authors tested a model and the results shows that the model receives H1 and reject H0. From the test results it can be concluded that the factor of use of social media Facebook as a learning media can increase learning motivation.","Facebook; Motivation; Social media","Motivation; Regression analysis; Students; Surveys; Analysis of data; Case study approach; Data collection; Facebook; Learning Activity; Learning motivation; Regression model; Social media; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Horton, W., (2012) E-Learning by Design, , USA: Pfeiffer; Malik, M., Parveen, N., Intrinsic Motivation of the High and Low Academic Achievers (2015) American Journal of Educational Research, 3 (11), pp. 1481-1483; Sugiyono, P.D., (2013) Metode Penelitian Bisnis (Pendekatan Kuantitatif, Kualitatif, Dan R&D), , Bandung: ALFABETA; Angus Stevenson, C.A.L., (2015) New Oxford American Dictionary, , http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/simulation, 12 January Online; Centeno, M.A., An Introduction to Simulation Modeling (1996) Proceedings of The 1996 Winter Simulation Conference, pp. 15-21; Sarwono, J., (2012) Metode Riset Skripsi Pendekatan Kuantitatif Menggunakan Prosedur SPSS, , Jakarta: PT Elex Media Komputindo; Lam, L., An Innovative Research on the usage of Facebook in the Higher Education context of Hong Kong (2012) The Electronic Journal of E-Learning, 10 (4), pp. 377-386",,"Castillo O.Douglas C.Ao S.I.Feng D.D.Korsunsky A.M.","","Newswood Limited","2017 International MultiConference of Engineers and Computer Scientists, IMECS 2017","15 March 2017 through 17 March 2017",,133365,20780958,9789881404732,,,"English","Lect.

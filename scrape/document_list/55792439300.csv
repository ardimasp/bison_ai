However, the local governments can only use the plans from the central government. The negative effects of this, among others, are improper land use allocation, lack of facilities, and crimes that are difficult to handle. This study proposes a geographic information system (GIS)-based method to analyze the proper central business district in Karawang, a small district in Java, Indonesia. Multi-criteria analysis of factors affecting the candidate locations was used through a weighted sum method in a model. The spatial data were retrieved and analyzed using a GIS tool to classify region into urban, peri-urban, and rural. Some central business locations have been found after reclassification which is located near the toll gates. Two locations in the north of Karawang were classified have the potential to become the new central business locations. © 2020 IEEE.","Extended Urbanization; Peri-Urban; Reclassification; Spatial Data Analysis; Weighted Sum Method","Land use; Location; Candidate locations; Central business districts; Central government; Land use allocation; Local government; Multi Criteria Analysis; Spatial data; Weighted sum method; Geographic information systems",,,,,,"Steiner, F., (2008) The Living Landscape-An Ecological Approach to Landscape Planning-Second Edition, , Washington DC: ISLAND PRESS; Williams, K., Burton, E., Jenks, M., (2000) Achieving Sustainable Urban Form.pdf, , E & FN Spon, New York; (2015) Habitat III Issue Papers-Public Space, , UN United Nation Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development; Mardiansjah, F.H., Extended urbanization in smaller-sized cities and small town development in Java: The case of the Tegal Region (2020) Iop Conf.

To enhance the model performance, the efforts implemented include optimizing the training process by applying sliding-windows methods and setting appropriate parameters. After obtaining the best settings, the proposed model was then compared with two other variants of the LSTM model, namely Vanilla LSTM and Stack LSTM. The model performance evaluation was done by finding Mean Square Error (MSE) and root mean square error values from training and testing process. The results show that there were increased performances from using sliding-windows method to optimize the training process and the appropriate parameter setting. Bidirectional LSTM model, along with the treatments implemented, gave the best performance compared to the two other models.

However, many young adults suffer poor sleep due to work or academic demands. Even more, sleep is associated with stress which is many young adults experienced it. To solve this problem, many epidemiologic studies suggest that exercise may improve sleep quality. On the other hand, several studies show that daily activity has no association with sleep quality. In this study, we tried to find more evidence of whether the daily activity has an association with sleep quality or not. We used a commercially available wearable device to capture the subject's heart rate, step count and deep sleep duration for 7 months. Then we used linear regression, XGBoost, and Long Short-Term Memory to find an association between these variables. The results show that there was no association between these variables. © 2020 IEEE.","Heart rate; Physical activity; Sleep quality; Step count; Wearable device","Information management; Wearable technology; Daily activity; Epidemiologic-study; Heart rates; Mental health; Sleep quality; Wearable devices; Young adults; Sleep research",,,,,,"Watson, N.F., Recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult: A joint consensus statement of the American academy of sleep medicine and sleep research society (2015) Sleep; Engle-Friedman, M., The effect of sleep loss on next day effort (2003) J.

Hence, researchers have begun to put significant efforts into studying the direct and indirect benefits of wearable devices for health and wellbeing. This paper summarizes recent studies on the use of consumer wearable devices to improve physical activity, mental health, and health consciousness. Methods: A thorough literature search was performed from several reputable data-bases, such as PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, arXiv, and bioRxiv mainly using “wearable device research” as a keyword, no earlier than 2018. As a result, 25 of the most recent and relevant papers included in this review cover several topics, such as previous literature reviews (9 papers), wearable device accuracy (3 papers), self-reported data collection tools (3 papers), and wearable device intervention (10 papers). Results: All the chosen studies are discussed based on the wearable device used, complementary data, study design, and data processing method. All these previous studies indicate that wearable devices are used either to validate their benefits for general wellbeing or for more serious medical contexts, such as cardiovascular dis-orders and post-stroke treatment. Conclusions: Despite their huge potential for adoption in clinical settings, wearable device accuracy and validity remain the key challenge to be met.

Recommendation system plays a major role to formulate and produce a series of recommendation based on users' behavior. Surprisingly, user-generated scoring or known as ratings are the main raw materials to learn the pattern of favorable contents of each user. As a part of collaborative filtering strategy, rating is considerable to be included in formulating recommended contents. In this research, the basic formulation to recommend books is discovered. The recommendation system has been tested on one random-picked user behavior and successfully has generated five recommended books by analyzing prior activities. The embedding model produced the recommended books with 59% of accuracy. This research is done to provide an insightful experience for developing content recommendation system in Binus University's corporate learning system. © 2019 IEEE.","collaborative filtering; rating; recommendation system; recommended literatures","Behavioral research; Collaborative filtering; Embeddings; Information management; Learning systems; Rating; Basic formulation; Content recommendations; Internet services; Model design; recommended literatures; User behaviors; User-generated; Recommender systems",,,,,,"Ricci, F., Shapira, B., Rokach, L., Recommender systems: Introduction and challenges (2015) Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 7-8. , Second Edition; Davidson, J., The YouTube video recommendation system (2010) Proc.

Many people think that they have already met the suggested guidelines. However, most of them were wrong when they quantify their activity level using a personal activity tracker device. This problem indicates the need for personal physical activity tracker or wearable device to maintain the fitness level. However, as wide-range wearable devices available today, it is difficult to find the most suitable one regarding the price and quality. This paper proposes a study to explore the association between the quality and the price of the devices. The quality is evaluated by comparing the accuracy of the heart rate sensor and step counter of several wearable devices with the ground truth measurements. The test result is then analyzed using a series of statistical methods including, a paired t-test, Pearson's correlation test, and Bland-Altman plot. Both t-test and correlation coefficient is used to plot the association between quality and price. © 2019 The Authors.

Agriculture is also very strategic for national development because it absorbs 32 % of the labor market, the largest compared to the trade sector which is only 23 %, services as much as 16%, industry by 13% and construction around 5%. However, agriculture cannot be perceived as a sufficient livelihood for some farmers, which is indicated by a decline in the number of farmers by 1.1 % per year. Knowledge and information will be one of the important solution to the problem if it can be collected, accessed and implemented by farmers, so they can increase productivity, and sell high-value commodities. Agricultural Knowledge and Information System is a necessary instrument for that purpose because it is an efficient model of managing resources which will drive low cost model of operation and can be accessed anytime and anywhere. This study proposes an agricultural knowledge and innovation system model by conducting a literature review and questionnaire distribution to collected data, then followed by conducting system analysis and design with Object Oriented Analysis Design (OOAD) method. Furthermore, the study using use case diagram and class diagram in Unified Modeling Language (UML) notations.

The growing city of Jakarta is facing various international events, increasing the complexity of these congestion problems. This research is aimed to propose an alternative solution for congestion problem in Jakarta using Cased-Based Reasoning (CBR) approach on Pejompongan area. The CBR integrated model analyzes congestion at a given point in a particular hour to identify the same case. The Cased-Based Management (CBM) algorithm approach is used to capture transient problems and ultimately reduce case base cases for their contribution to long-term maintenance. Congestion data is obtained from CCTV cameras via website lewatmana.com in some strategic areas. With that data, we use CBR's integrated model to adjust traffic time for traffic flow to be optimized so that congestion will decompose. The results of this study can be used by relevant government agencies and policymakers in Jakarta to formulate the best solution to solve the congestion problem in the Indonesian capital. Image analysis at nights and bad weather conditions become a limitation and also the integration with traffic lights control in this paper that can be a new topic for further research. © 2018 IEEE.","Case based reasoning;

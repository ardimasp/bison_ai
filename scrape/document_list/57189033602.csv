[1] using two methods: the Levenberg-Marquard and Bruce-Force method. This modeling is particularly important in the case of seismicity. Given that it takes a good model for predicting the strength of earthquakes in order to reduce the risk of the impact of natural disasters. Two major contributions of this study are ground motion attenuation model specific to the subduction zone that has been optimized with the Levenberg-Marquard method and Bruce-Force uses a model Youngs et al. [1] and a proof that the Levenberg-Marquard method for optimization model is better than Bruce-Force method. The Levenberg-Marquardt method has been proven to provide more accurate results on the modeling of ground motion attenuation which is indicated by a very small deviation between the values of PGA predictable results with the PGA actual values. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",,"Computational methods; Disasters; Geophysics; Optimization; Earthquake ground motions; Force method; Ground-motion attenuations; Levenberg-Marquardt; Levenberg-Marquardt method; Natural disasters; Optimization modeling; Subduction zones; Earthquakes",,,,,"Acknowledgments.

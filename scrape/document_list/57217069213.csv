But some of the big problems that are often faced by the restaurant business in implementing SI have become increasingly clear, among which are systems that are running less than optimal due to lack of experience. This paper will examine a restaurant franchise in Indonesia called SS Restaurant. Currently, SS Restaurant is facing complaints against the restaurant information system (RIS) such as the RIS system which is no longer adequate and does not have the latest features and the research and development (R&D) process of the restaurant is not running due to slow data processing and not optimal control outlets. The purpose of this paper is to design and recommend new business processes in restaurant RIS and add new system models such as online ordering, real-time reporting, cloud-based systems and data analysis for restaurants. The model in the Zachman framework that will be used in this research framework becomes a 3x3 matrix, basedon 3 main perspectives required by Restaurant SS management that is: General Scope, Owner Perspective and Designer Perspective. By implementing this new RIS, Restaurant SS is expected to be able to further increase their business’ performance through the benefits of improved operational efficiency and continual development of the implemented information system. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

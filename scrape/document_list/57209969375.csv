Localization techniques using this satellite cannot work in buildings; therefore research for localization techniques in buildings has been the focus of researchers in the last decade. Localization techniques in the area that cannot be covered by satellite can be split into two groups namely techniques signal using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and techniques using the access point or Wi-Fi. Most researcher still face problems in localization technique in building known as Indoor Position System (IPS) implementation, especially to escalation the precision of techniques. In this paper, we presented a assessment of the papers (2006-2016) on indoor position system that focus on accuracy and placement of sensor for both BLE and Wi-Fi. This paper is a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) establishes a fusion exploration based on the exploration model by PRISMA checklist. The finishing identifies of chosen major papers for the initially phase had 25 major papers; the complete texts of 25 major papers were explored. Then, we implemented the synthesis to construct parameter and aspects that affect accuracy of indoor position system implementation for BLE and Wi-Fi. Base on review, we can conclude that the fingerprint of sensor play important role to increase accuracy of system. © 2018 IEEE.","Bluetooth low energy; GPS; indoor localization; Indoor positioning system","Bluetooth; Indoor positioning systems; Satellites; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Bluetooth low energies (BLE); Bluetooth low energies (BTLE); Exploration model; Indoor localization; Localization technique; Placement of sensors; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Global positioning system",,,,"Kementerian Riset, Teknologi dan Pendidikan Tinggi: 036/VR","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia for their support in making this research possible.

We applied 2 methods, one for classifying the conversation type and the other for calculating the online grooming percentage. We used neural network to classify the conversation into several classes. As for calculating the percentage, we used analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to find grooming score based on priority score for each class. This research focused more on online conversation that consists of two people and used English as the main language. The results can be used to determine whether the conversation is considered as groom or not. © 2019 ICIC International.","Analytic hierarchy process; Neural network; Online child grooming; Online conversation; Priority score",,,,,,"Randhawa, T., Jacobs, S., (2013) Child Grooming: ‘Offending All the Way through from the Start’ – Exploring the Call from Law Reform, , Australia: Child Wise; Saaty, T.L., Decision making with the analytic hierarchy process (2008) Int.

In current modern society, information technology exists as a multidisciplinary tool to solve lingering problems that could not be solved by traditional efforts. This paper aims to provide knowledge regarding identified efforts to fight corruption specifically in Indonesia region. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology is used as the methodology, and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow is used as framework to identify relevant records. Scopus database is used as data source. A total of 10 records are labelled as relevant to this research, and the findings are synthesized. It was found from the records that the main areas of interest for ICT research for corruption prevention in Indonesia are (1) information transparency, (2) operational enhancement, (3) success evaluation, (4) security and fraud, and (4) decision support. The findings are expected to assist future research in term of providing valuable insights on corruption prevention using ICT in Indonesia. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Previous studies have identified variables that predict impulse buying, but not many of them have examined the human's self. This study aimed at investigating the roles of insecure self-engulfed self and perceived aesthetic of online shop in predicting the online impulse buying. The participants were 285 private sector employees (156 males and 129 females; Mean of the age of 27.1 years old; Standard deviation of the age of 5.9 years) in the Greater Jakarta, Indonesia. Data analysis using multiple linear regression analysis showed that empirical data supported the positive prediction hypotheses. An additional descriptive analysis applying the Terror Management Theory showed that participants with higher mortality salience tend to have more online buying experience, and they are inclined to purchase more luxurious items such as jewelry and expensive watch than participants with lower mortality salience. This study contributes to developing the interdisciplinary field of psychological science and information technology by integrating the self and the virtual medium of shopping variables as well as by recommending behavioral engineering to control online impulse buying. © International Journal on Advanced Science Engineering Information Technology.","Aesthetic; Business psychology; Impulsive buying; Mortality salience; Online; Self",,,,,,,"Lu, Z., Wang, S., Li, X., Yang, L., Yang, D., Wu, D., ""Online shop location optimization using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision model-Case study on Taobao.com,"" (2012) Knowl-Based Syst, 32, pp. 76-83; ""Meningkatnya pertumbuhan belanja online di pasar negara berkembang-portal lengkap dunia marketing,"" (2012) Portal Lengkap Dunia Marketing, , http://www.marketing.co.id/meningkatnya-pertumbuhan-belanjaonline-di-pasar-negara-berkembang/, [Accessed: 14-Dec-2016]; Marketing, D.I., (2016) ""E-commerce usage in Indonesia 2016,"", , http://www.dionlinesurvey.com/en/2016/09/23/e-commerce-usage-in-indonesia-2016/, DI Marketing Online.

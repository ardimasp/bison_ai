A good medical personnel schedule can overcome a lot of troubles for operational staff, management and the medical personnel. This problem can be solved using single objectives optimization and multi objectives optimization. In previous research, the scheduling optimization problem was solved single-objectively using Native Binary Particle Swarming Optimization (NBPSO). In this research, the researcher attempted to solve the problem multi-objectively using Non-Dominated Sorting Native Binary Particle Swarming Optimization (NSNBPSO). In this research, a constraint handling method was proposed called deallocation method which produced schedules that met the requirement of all constraints. In the performance comparison, researcher compared the performance of the proposed NSNBPSO and the previous NBPSO. The metrics used for the comparison were Coverage Rate, Hypervolume and Processing Time.NSNBPSO successfully produced 10 Solutions which provided more options to the stakeholder. However, NSNBPSO produced infeasible solutions and violated constraints in this research. Therefore, deallocation method was proposed and implemented to help NSNBPSO producing feasible solutions. The performance result showed that NSNBPSO with deallocation method had 35% more average hypervolume value than NBPSO, 50% of solutions from NSNBPSO dominated solution from NBPSO in coverage rate evaluation. However, it needed 85% more processing timeandcan still be considered acceptable. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

In the scheduling, a mathematical model is developed to represent personnel arrangement in a hospital. Afterward, we need algorithm to solve the mathematical model in which they can be exact or metaheuristic algorithm. Exact algorithm can provide a global optimum in the solution, however finding optimal solution for complex and vast number of constraints is time consuming since physician scheduling is NP-Hard problem. on the other hand, metaheuristic approach provides solution to the scheduling problems in much less time compared to exact algorithm. Therefore, metaheuristic approach is considered more appropriate to solve physician scheduling problem. In this paper, we conduct a preliminary review of the latest population bases approaches in hospital related scheduling, especially Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based algorithms, to understand strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and recommend the most suitable one applicable to solve physician scheduling problem. Future work will be suggested for further improvements on the algorithm. © 2018 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Healthcare; Medical Resources; Metaheuristic; Operation Research; Physicians; Scheduling","Artificial intelligence; Computational complexity; Genetic algorithms; Health care; Hospitals; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Pattern recognition; Problem solving; Medical Resources; Meta heuristic algorithm; Meta-heuristic approach; Metaheuristic; Operation research; Optimal solutions; Physicians; Scheduling problem; Scheduling",,,,,"Erhard, M., Schoenfelder, J., Fügener, A., Brunner, J.O., State of the art in physician scheduling (2018) European Journal of Operational Research, 265 (1), pp. 1-18; Gunawan, A., Lau, H.C., Master physician scheduling problem (2013) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 64 (3), pp. 410-425; Alharbi, A., Alqahtani, K., (2016) A Genetic Algorithm Solution for the Doctor Scheduling Problem, 1, pp. 91-97; Lo, C.-C., Lin, Lin, T.-H., A particle swarm optimization approach for physician scheduling in a hospital emergency department (2011) Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation; Kennedy, J., Eberhart, R.C., A discrete binary version of the particle swarm algorithm (1997) IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

The music director has been using global trend, i.e. radio top music charts to produce favorite song list. This study will utilize data warehouse and business intelligence for PT ABC's marketing and sales strategy, e.g. to improve its service to customers, to increase number of active users and the duration of streaming per user. OLTP data suggested for the data warehouse is the existing streaming transactions, which will be used to analyze customers' most preferred songs. The proposed method to design the data warehouse is using 9-steps from Kimball. The selected process for the data warehouse is customers' streaming and downloading process, with dimensions of location, time and song, with fact less table of the streaming itself. The result of analysis will be customers' most preferred play list based on several parameters, such as customers' locations, streaming hours or days and genre of songs. © 2018 IEEE.","Business Intelligence; Data Warehouse; Decision Making; OLAP Analysis; Star Schema","Competitive intelligence; Data warehouses; Decision making; Information analysis; Pattern recognition; Digital music; Global trends; ITS Services; Number of active users; OLAP Analysis; Sales strategies; Star schema; Sales",,,,,"Kusek, D., Leonhard, G., (2005) The Future of Music: Manifestofor the Digital Music Revolution; Aguiar, L., Martens, B., Digital music consumption on the Internet: Evidence from clickstream data (2016) Inf.

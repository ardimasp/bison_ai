Cashless payment system is an emerging market in Indonesia. There are many of users and merchants that have been adopting cashless payment system replacing the conventional transactions. Micro-merchant is one of the stakeholders of mobile payment ecosystem which specifically receiving the low-value payment transaction from the mobile payment users. To measure micro-merchant’s readiness in continuing their usage on cashless payment system, we used the Technology Readiness Index (TRI) 2.0 approach. Parasuraman and Colby (2014) developed TRI 2.0 as a research scale in measuring and classifying individuals by their propensity to adopt technology. This research will provide the highlights of current situation of micro-merchant’s technology readiness and their continuance intention to adopt cashless payment system based on TR constructs. There are four constructs which are Optimism, Innovativeness, Discomfort and Insecurity that will be tested to find their relationship to the continuance intention in adopting cashless payment system. This research found that optimism is a determinant factor driving the micro-merchants’ continuance intention to adopt cashless payment system while discomfort is becoming main inhibitor. © 2020 IJSTR.","Cashless payment system; Micro-merchant; Mobile payment; Technology readiness; TRI",,,,,,"Ariani, A., Napitupulu, D., Jati, R., Kadar, J., Syafrullah, M., Testing of Technology Readiness Index Model Based on Exploratory Factor Analysis Approach (2018) Journal of Physics: Conference Series; Aron, J., Mobile Money and the Economy: A Review of the Evidence (2018) The World Bank Research Observer, 33 (2), pp. 135-188; Arvidsson, N., Consumer attitudes on mobile payment services-results from a proof of concept test (2014) International Journal of Bank Marketing, 32 (2), pp. 150-170; Au, Y.A., Kauffman, R.J., The economics of mobile payments: Understanding stakeholder issues for an emerging financial technology application (2008) Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 7 (2), pp. 141-164; Celik, H., Kocaman, R., Roles of Self-Monitoring, Fashion Involvement and Technology Readiness in an Individual's Propensity to Use Mobile Shopping (2017) Journal of System and Information Technology; Dahlberg, T., Guo, J., Ondrus, J., A critical review of mobile-payment research (2015) Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 14 (5), pp. 265-284; Eka, R., (2018) Trend of the Development of ""Mobile Payment"" in Indonesia., , https://dailysocial.id/post/perkembangan-mobile-payment-indonesia, March 6, Retrieved January 14, 2019, from dailysocial.id; Gombachika, H.S., Khangamwa, G., (2013) ICT Readiness and Acceptance among TEVT Students in University of Malawi, 30 (1), pp. 35-43; Guo, J., Bouwman, H., An analytical framework for an m-payment ecosystem: A merchants' perspective (2015) Telecommunications Policy, 40 (2-3), pp. 147-167; Hair, J.F., Jr., Black, W.C., Babin, B.J., Anderson, R.E., (2014) Multivariate Data Analysis, , 7 ed.).

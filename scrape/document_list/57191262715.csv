Using the Global Financial Development Database-GFDD, we estimate a regression of net interest margins to a set of variables specifically proxies for competition, capacity and some controlling variables. Panel data econometric techniques employed are fixed effect, random effect and pooled OLS. We find that intermediation cost is positively associated with capital adequacy, overhead cost, return on equity and ZSCORE. On the other hand, it is negatively associated with loan to deposit ratio, deposit to GDP and GDP per capita. Finally, our study has shown that income level and financial deepening have positive impact on intermediation efficiency. © 2020, Universita Putra Malaysia.","Bank intermediation cost; Capacity; Competition; Panel data econometrics",,,,,,"Aaron, A., Nainggolan, Y.A., Trinugroho, I., Corporate failure prediction model in Indonesia: Revisiting the Z-scores, discriminant analysis, logistic regression and artificial neural network (2017) Journal for Global Business Advancement, 10 (2), pp. 187-209; Al-Harbi, A., The determinants of conventional banks profitability in developing and underdeveloped OIC countries (2019) Journal of Economics, Finance and Administrative Science, 24 (47), pp. 4-28; Allen, L., The determinants of bank interest margins: A note (1988) Journal of Financial and Quantitative analysis, 23 (2), pp. 231-235; Angbazo, L., Commercial bank net interest margins, default risk, interest-rate risk, and off-balance sheet banking (1997) Journal of Banking & Finance, 21 (1), pp. 55-87; Angori, G., Aristei, D., Gallo, M., Determinants of Banks' Net Interest Margin: Evidence from the Euro Area during the Crisis and Post-Crisis Period (2019) Sustainability, 11 (14), p. 3785; Ariss, R.T., On the implications of market power in banking: Evidence from developing countries (2010) Journal of banking & Finance, 34 (4), pp. 765-775; Athanasoglou, P.P., Brissimis, S.N., Delis, M.D., Bank-specific, industry-specific and macroeconomic determinants of bank profitability (2008) Journal of international financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 18 (2), pp. 121-136; Barth, J.R., Caprio, G., Levine, R., (2008) Rethinking bank regulation: Till angels govern, , Cambridge University Press; Beck, T., Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Levine, R., Bank concentration, competition, and crises: First results (2006) Journal of Banking & Finance, 30 (5), pp. 1581-1603; Berger, A.N., Udell, G.F., Some evidence on the empirical significance of credit rationing (1992) Journal of Political Economy, 100 (5), pp. 1047-1077; Berger, A.N., Udell, G.F., Small business credit availability and relationship lending: The importance of bank organisational structure (2002) The economic journal, 112 (477), pp. F32-F53; Berger, A.N., Molyneux, P., Wilson, J.O., (2014) The Oxford handbook of banking, , OUP Oxford; Berger, A.N., Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Levine, R., Haubrich, J.G., Bank concentration and competition: An evolution in the making (2004) Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, pp. 433-451; Boone, J., A new way to measure competition (2008) The Economic Journal, 118 (531), pp. 1245-1261; Boyd, J.H., De Nicolo, G., The theory of bank risk taking and competition revisited (2005) The Journal of finance, 60 (3), pp. 1329-1343; Bresnahan, T.F., The oligopoly solution concept is identified (1982) Economics Letters, 10 (1-2), pp. 87-92; Walsh, C.E., (2017) Monetary theory and policy, , MIT press; Čihák, M., Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Feyen, E., Levine, R., Benchmarking financial systems around the world (2012) World Bank policy research working paper, p. 6175; Degryse, H., Kim, M., Ongena, S., (2009) Microeconometrics of banking: Methods, applications, and results, , Oxford University Press, USA; Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Huizinga, H., Financial structure and bank profitability (2000) World Bank Policy Research Working Paper, p. 2430; Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Levine, R., (2004) Financial structure and economic growth: A cross-country comparison of banks, markets, and development, , MIT press; Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Laeven, L., Levine, R., Regulations, Market Structure, Institutions, and the Cost of Financial Intermediation (2004) Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 36 (3), pp. 593-622; Demirguc-Kunt, A., Martínez Pería, M.S., (2010) A framework for analyzing competition in the banking sector: An application to the case of Jordan, , The World Bank; Dietrich, A., Wanzenried, G., Determinants of bank profitability before and during the crisis: Evidence from Switzerland (2011) Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 21 (3), pp. 307-327; Eichenbaum, M.S., Hansen, L.P., Singleton, K.J., A time series analysis of representative agent models of consumption and leisure choice under uncertainty (1988) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 103 (1), p. 5178; Entrop, O., Memmel, C., Ruprecht, B., Wilkens, M., Determinants of bank interest margins: Impact of maturity transformation (2015) Journal of Banking & Finance, 54, pp. 1-19; Fischer, K.H., Pfeil, C., (2003) Regulation and competition in German banking: An assessment, , (No. 2003/19).

The auditor must examine the report or bookkeeping company. When conducting its audit work, auditors are required to have competence in accounting or finance and always maintain an independent attitude. Even so, until now there are still many people who doubt the competence and independence of public accountants. This is compounded by the many cases involving the public accounting profession, in many financial statement fraud cases that occurs worldwide such as the Enron, Phar-Mor, Crazy Eddie case. This study aims to analyze in order to obtained statistical result regarding how auditor work experience, understanding of Good Governance (GG), independence of auditor influenced quality of the audit result. The sample in our study was obtained by using a purposive sampling method for certified auditor firm in the Jakarta Special Capital Region. We have 200 auditors as our respondents from various audit firms. Hypothesis testing is done by using ordinary least square. We used determination of coefficient, t test and f test. On the conclusion, we have evidence that good governance variable significantly influences audit quality, while work experience variables and independence variable do not significantly influence audit quality. Our study also stated that all the independent variables give influence magnitude 64.8 percent for explaining quality of audit. © BEIESP.","Audit quality; Auditor; Corporate governance; Experience; Good; Independence; Work",,,,,,"Handoko, B.L., Widuri, R., Sarjono, H., The effect of third party auditor and quality of service through cloud storage security to cloud user trust (2017) 2017 9Th IEEE Int.

The data was analysed based on 100 valid responses collected from external auditors. The results show that the variables of performance expectancy, effort expectancy and facilitating conditions directly influence the behavioural intention of external auditors to use GAS. Behavioural intention influences the use behaviour while social influence does not affect the behavioural intention. This study concludes that audit firms can focus on the benefits of audit software and the availability of features that fit the tasks during the audit process such as test of control and substantive testing. In addition audit firms can choose audit software that has clear instructions and is easy to learn. Further, audit firms can also improve supporting facilities for the use of audit software such as conducting training on the use of audit software, and investing in additional organizational and technical infrastructures. © 2019, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Anthropocentric religious communication; BAZNAS empowering; Marginal communities",,,,,,"Ahmi, A., Kent, S., The utilisation of generalized audit software (GAS) by external auditors (2013) Managerial Auditing Journal, 28 (2), pp. 88-113; Bierstaker, J., Janvrin, D., Lowe, D.J., What factors influence auditors' use of computer-assisted audit techniques?

The qualitative approach was used by conducting face-to-face semi structured interview with the internal auditors from Indonesian listed companies. This research used Agency Theory and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as underpinning theories, therefore this research provides academic contribution not only in auditing area but also in information technology. The results indicated not all participants agreed that GAS is helping them in producing a transparent and accountable financial report. Also, this research found that company’s internal condition and individual characteristics of internal auditor are the inhibiting factors in using GAS. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Generalized audit software; Good corporate governance; IDX; Internal auditor; Technology acceptance model",,,,,,"Rezaee, Z., (2008) Corporate Governance and Ethics: Wiley; Braun, R., Davis, E., Computer-assisted audit tools and techniques: Analysis and perspectives (2003) Managerial Auditing Journal, 18, p. 725; Debreceny, R., Lee, S.-L., Neo, W., Toh, J.S., Employing generalized audit software in the financial services sector: Challenges and opportunities (2005) Managerial Auditing Journal, 20, p. 605; Ismail, N.A., Abidin, A.Z., Perception towards the importance and knowledge of information technology among auditors in Malaysia (2009) Journal of Accounting and Taxation, 1, pp. 061-069; Mahzan, N., Lymer, A., Examining the adoption of computer-assisted audit tools and techniques: Cases of generalized audit software use by internal auditors (2014) Managerial Auditing Journal, 29, pp. 327-349; Ahmi, A., Kent, S., The utilisation of generalized audit software (GAS) by external auditors (2013) Managerial Auditing Journal, 28, pp. 88-113; Boritz, E., Information systems assurance (2002) Research Accounting as an Information Systems Discipline, pp. 231-256. , V.

This research is conducted to examine whether auditor's ability and willingness to communicate with client and professionalism in work as variable independent have significant impact on client responses in collaborating and supporting auditor's inquiry. This topic also tests inquiry as one of the audit procedures as the intervening variable to strengthen both auditor's communication and professional attitude impact to successful audit process. The research method which used is causal quantitative using path analysis to test the impact of independent and intervening variable on dependent variable. The data were collected using sample questionnaire to the respondent of 152 Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Firms in Indonesia. The data was processed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with statistical software: Amos version 22. The results of this research were: professional attitude has positive impact on client response to inquiry. Professional attitude has positive impact on successful audit process. Auditor's communication has positive impact on client responses to inquiry. Auditor's communication has positive impact on successful audit process. Finally, client responses to inquiry positively impact the successful audit process. © 2016 IEEE.","audit; communication; inquiry; process; professional","Communication; Information management; Processing; Regression analysis; audit; Business practices; Certified public accountants; Dependent variables; inquiry; professional; Statistical software; Structural equation modeling; Professional aspects",,,,,"Boynton, W.C., Johnson, R.N., (2006) Modern Auditing: Assurance Services and the Integrity of Financial Reporting: Wiley; Turley, S., Humphrey, C., Samsonova-Taddei, A., Siddiqui, J., Woods, M., Basoudis, I., Skills, Competencies and the Sustainability of the Modern Audit; Al-Khaddash, H., Al Nawas, R., Ramadan, A., Factors affecting the quality of auditing: The case of Jordanian commercial banks (2013) International Journal of Business and Social Science, 4; Cheney, G., Lee Ashcraft, K., Considering the professional in communication studies: Implications for theory and research within and beyond the boundaries of organizational communication (2007) Communication Theory, 17, pp. 146-175; Albrecht, W.S., Albrecht, C.O., Albrecht, C.C., Zimbelman, M.F., (2015) Fraud Examination, , 5 ed.: Cengeage Learning; Carvalho, J.M., The crucial role of internal communication audit to improve internal and general market orientations (2013) European Scientific Journal, 9; Comunale, C.L., Sexton, T.R., Mandatory auditor rotation and retention: Impact on market share (2005) Managerial Auditing Journal, 20, pp. 235-248; Colbert, J.L., Jahera, J., John, S., (2011) The Role of the Audit and Agency Theory, 4, p. 6. , 2011-10-27,2011; Bender, R., What is effective audit and what can you tell (2006) The Audit Committee Chair Forum, , Cranfield University School of Management, United Kingdom; Arens, A.A., Elder, R.J., Beasley, M.S., (2014) Auditing and Assurance Services: An Integrated Approach, , 5th ed.: Prentice Hall; Spearing, K., (2015) The Working Papers of Maltese Internal Auditors: An Analysis; Goldhaber, G.M., Communication audits in the age of the Internet (2002) Management Communication Quarterly: McQ, 15, p. 451; Galegos, F., Title, , unpublished; Brown, T., Majors, T.M., Peecher, M.E., (2014) The Impact of A Judgment Rule and Critical Audit Matters on Assessments of Auditor Legal Liability-the Moderating Role of Legal Knowledge, , Available at SSRN 2483221; Saiewitz, A., Kida, T., (2014) The Effects of An Auditor's Communication Mode and Professional Tone on Client Responses to Audit Inquiries, , Available at SSRN 2449795; Burgoon, J.K., Stoner, G., Bonito, J.A., Dunbar, N.E., Trust and deception in mediated communication (2003) System Sciences, 2003.

Design/methodology/approach: Results of this study are based on semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted in Indonesia with audit firms of varying sizes. Findings: Key study findings included the identification of highly influential adoption factors, especially environmental factors, such as availability of information technology-skilled auditors in the local market, client needs and expectations and client size. This study has also identified factors, not identified in previous research, as being influential including the importance of GAS availability in a range of languages and the necessity of a supportive professional and regulatory environment. Originality/value: This study makes several contributions to the literature including that it identifies new influential factors in the TOE framework. This framework has not been widely applied in auditing research and looks beyond the individual perspective to that of the organization as a whole. Moreover, the present study takes a developing country perspective and examines a range of audit firms. In contrast, most studies to date in the area have taken a Western focus and have concentrated on large audit firms. Additionally, this study provides an in-depth analysis through the use of semi-structured interviews, whereas prior studies have relied on surveys. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Auditing; Generalized audit software; Indonesia; Technology organization environment framework",,,,,,"(2015) Auditing standard ASA 240: The auditor’s responsibilities relating to fraud in and audit of a financial report, , Australian Auditing Standards; Adams, D.A., Nelson, R.R., Todd, P.A., Perceived usefulness, ease of use, and usage of information technology: a replication (1992) MIS Quarterly, 16 (2), pp. 227-247; Agarwal and Prasad, J., Are individual differences germane to the acceptance of new information technologies?

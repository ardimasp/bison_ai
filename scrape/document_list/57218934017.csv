The data for this study were drawn from a balanced sample of 111 public manufacturing firms listed in the Indonesia Stock Exchange between 2009 and 2013. A Tobit regression analysis with cluster-robust standard errors was then employed to find the effects of firm size, profitability, sales growth, financial leverage, and inter-period on the magnitude of dividend yield. This study finds that firm size, profitability, and sales growth positively influence the magnitude of dividends paid relative to stock prices received by shareholders. On the other hand, it also finds that financial leverage negatively affects dividends. Another result suggests the levels of dividends vary across time. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Dividend policies; Indonesia Stock Exchange; Manufacturing firms; Tobit regression",,,,,,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Indonesian Higher Education for funding this research.","Aivazian, V., Booth, L., Cleary, S., Do emerging market firms follow different dividend policies from U.S. firms?

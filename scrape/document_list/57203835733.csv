However, this method leads to some problems, like a difficulty of moving a traveler to a proper position (perspective) and an inhibition of work due to damaged control panel. In this research, a model of a web-based application to control a traveler with spans by using Raspberry Pi is developed. This research's contribution is a model of a web-based application for traveler automation in all possible movements of its components. As the results, the experiments show that the program implemented doesn't take much time and the execution of a command is done in a reasonable time. Moreover, for the safety of the bridge traveler, this program also implements a sensor that works when a component is at its most downward/inward position and detecting a blocking object in the middle of a possible movement and stops the movement immediately. © 2018 The Authors.

With the potential of cultural diversity in Java, creative economic activities on this island need the development. The local wisdom and cultural events are reflecting the creativity of the community and can provide economic value to the community. The physical quality of creative economic spaces that can become generators in some cultural tourism areas does not have functional quality space. To support the preservation of cultural heritage and the development of superior cultural tourism areas, the quality of an excellent creative economic space is necessary. The aim of this study is to identify physical quality of space for creative economic activities or events. The method of this study used a qualitative descriptive method. Results of this study provide an overview that cultural village in Semarang and Banyuwangi have five potential creative economic activities: traditional architecture, culinary, crafts, music, and performing arts. The physical quality of these two creative economic spaces is still limited because of the limited economic capacity of the community in providing the spaces. They are shaping and realizing space with utilizes natural conditions (green open spaces or spaces among tall trees) and local material (bamboo). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Historic preservation; Tourism; Cultural diversity; Cultural events; Cultural heritages; Economic activities; Economic capacity; Natural conditions; Physical quality; Traditional architecture; Economic analysis",,,,"Kementerian Riset Teknologi Dan Pendidikan Tinggi Republik Indonesia

Construction of other structures such as buildings, walls is a part that has developed over time. It is causing this development is to respond to the needs of construction quality, cost, and time of the construction. In this case there are two types of wall construction, red bricks wall which made of clay and other one is a light concrete bricks wall which made of cement, silica, sand and limestone. The purpose of this paper is to determine the method of wall construction is more efficient in terms of cost and time between methods of red bricks wall and light concrete bricks wall. The study was conducted using a survey method, and comparative literature. These results indicate that both methods have advantages and disadvantages of each other. Red bricks wall method is cheaper in the cost of the process while the light concrete bricks wall method much faster in the process. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

It means buildings have to reduce the energy consumption of fossil fuel and take action to use clean energy such as wind energy. The higher altitude, the higher wind speed. Wind speed as a function of altitude has a chance to be used in highrise buildings. Indonesia is a humid tropical country, which generally has the character of relatively low wind speeds. In another hand, high-rise buildings have considerable potential value to utilize height as a factor to obtain sufficient wind speed. This study aims to identify the potential for wind energy in high-rise buildings in humid tropical climate. Problems focused on the design arrangement of wind turbine type on the building and the potential energy can be harnessed. This research was conducted in suburban areas where the roughness level is lower than the city centre. This study focused on assessing the potential of the wind on tall buildings in a built environment in suburban areas. The research method is quantitative research which the variable is observed from wind speed data. Research developed by the experimental research method with CFD simulation to meet the built environment wind profile for further analysis. The variable data is observed from field measurement and local wind speed data. Case study takes on campus Bina Nusantara Alam Sutera as a case of the building which represents a type of highrise buildings in suburban Jakarta area. This study shows at least five types of possible arrangements which can be applied to buildings. This study presents the alternative use of wind energy utilization at Bina Nusantara University as a cross-subsidy scheme. Wind energy can replace 3.27 % of main building energy consumption equal with CO2 emission reductions as 127,650 kgCO2.

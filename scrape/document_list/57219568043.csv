It is not commonly practiced systematically, particularly in state owned companies. Hence, the purpose of this research is to develop a web-based knowledge management system design based on the path analysis results and TAM model to support state owned companies. The path analysis aims to determine the extent of the employee's intention to support knowledge management system creation. The data will be collected from 63 respondent questionnaire, interviews and observation in the construction consulting company. The research results revealed the significance between attitude toward computer and organizational culture toward the intentions of employees using knowledge management systems. Therefore, the knowledge management system design is recommended to apply in the company with the suggestive KMS features. © 2020 IEEE.","Knowledge management system; OOAD; Path analysis; State owned companies; TAM","Behavioral research; Human resource management; Knowledge based systems; Regression analysis; Surveys; Systems analysis; Consulting companies; Knowledge management system; Organizational cultures; Path analysis; Research results; State-owned companies; Support knowledge; Web based; Knowledge management",,,,,"Yusof, M.N., Bakar, A.H.A., Knowledge management and growth performance in construction companies: A framework (2012) Procedia-Soc.

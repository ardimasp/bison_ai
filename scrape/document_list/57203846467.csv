It is possible to be used in many applications such as visual search, information retrieval and augmented reality. However, various things affect the appearance of the objects, which makes the recognition process harder, especially if a single reference image is used. In this paper, we proposed a combination method between Salient Object Detection and Object Instance Recognition using Image Matching and Geometric Verification. Salient Object Detection is used during initial processing (feature extraction), while Geometric Verification is performed using Best Score Increasing Subsequence (BSIS). Experimental results showed that the Fβ score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of saliency map on Stanford Mobile Visual Search Dataset (SMVS) are quite satisfactory. While the results of the combination method show 1.92% performance improvement than the previous method which is BSIS without Salient Object Detection. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

One of the many LMS is Moodle. This LMS has many learning features and can be extended by installing “plugins”. However, Moodle is monolith, which means all its resources like front-end, files, and database are installed in the same server and requires high cost server to do so. This study presents Moodle LMS architecture hosted in Google Cloud Platform to solve this problem. The core LMS learning features are extended by adding location-based learning and object-recognition learning as gamification element. Both features are implemented in the form of Moodle plugins that utilizes external service via API. Location-based learning utilizes Leaflet interactive maps and Google Maps place autocomplete search. While object-recognition learning utilizes an object recognition service (ORS) hosted in Google Kubernetes Engine to classify, store, and create image models. Evaluation of the architecture uses the Architecture Trade-off Analysis Method (ATAM) to evaluate performance and scalability as quality attributes. Experimental results showed that Moodle core LMS could support 480 concurrent users with average response time of 11.37 seconds with 100% availability. While ORS could support 960 concurrent users with availability above 98%. Thus, educators could use this architecture as an example to support many students. In the future, this solution may be evaluated if it could increase student motivation and achievement. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Therefore, many researchers compete with others to present their best in object recognition. Since object recognition has been studied for a long time and encompassed diverse approaches, therefore a review of the latest works is needed. This paper aims to deliver the trends in object recognition researches focusing on instance recognition and foreground detection such as salient object detection and object detection as supporting methods. Covering 34 publications, we survey the approaches, methods, datasets, performance measure, and experimental results. We also present research challenges in object recognition which can be used as suggestions for future works. We hope that our work can provide an overview of the current trends for object recognition and foreground detection methods. © 2019 The Authors.

This paper surveys some analysis of gamification models. MDA framework is used to identify surveyed papers by breaking them down into three categories: mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics. Findings from the survey show there are many gamification models in education domain. However, there are some very representative gamification models could be used as a method to increase motivation, achievement and engagement in learning activities. By knowing the latest gamification models in education domain stated in this paper, it could help gamification practitioners to make new strategies in learning activities to increase students' motivation, achievement and involvement. We also suggest some gamification strategies, which combine several mechanics in such a way to create dynamics that results in all types of aesthetics outputs. © 2018 The Authors.

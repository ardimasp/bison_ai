The financial companies are no exception, especially with the increasing trend of competition today. Therefore, this research paper focuses on evaluating existing resources within the company as well as any company activities that significantly affect the company's revenue targets through secondary data analysis. Resource-Based Theory (RBT) and Dynamic Capability Theory (DCT) are the central theories that have been used in this paper. The results of this study concluded that human resources through recruitment contributed the most significant support to the company's performance, especially on non-bank financial institutions listed on the stock exchange. This analysis is one of the critical indicators for leaders, especially with extraordinary changes due to the presence of digital financial technology and applications. © 2019, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Competition; Non-bank financial; Performance; Resource development; Resource-based theory",,,,,,"Arend, R.J., Bromiley, P., Assessing The Dynamic Capabilities View: Spare Change, Everyone?

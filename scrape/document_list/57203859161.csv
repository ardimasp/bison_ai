How- ever, there are still limited survey papers that provide the indicators, methods, and the examples of the Smart City cases. This research aims to provide a systematic and com- prehensive survey using a systematic literature review method, on indicators, methods, and the examples of the Smart City cases. This literature review contributes to the foun- dation of the research in the area of Smart City. The method used in this paper is a sys- tematic and comprehensive literature review proposed by Ridley and Okoli & Schabram. The results show that Smart Environment is the most paramount indicator used in the literature. Moreover, some characteristics generally appear in the studies such as: Small scale implementation, the readiness of the laws & regulations as well as the technology. © 2020 ICIC International.

Several cases had been reported due to the usage of a fake transcript. One modus of using fake transcript is to enter a higher level of education and job promotion. The new technology found called Blockchain believes in solving the problem. Characteristics of Blockchain Technology such as secured, immutable, distributed, transparent seem to be matched with transcript document requirement. Therefore, the research tries to create a process model of the university teaching and learning process. Several studies have been done; however, no detailed process shown especially for teaching and learning activities. The research question is, how are teaching, and learning activities can be supported by Blockchain Technology? Qualitative method used in this research, focus group discussion with 9 reputable universities discussed the academic operation process and the result show that it is possible to adopt Blockchain Technology into the teaching and learning process to avoid forgery of university transcript documents. © 2020 IEEE.","Blockchain technology; Blockchain technology-based; Teaching and learning process; Transcript","Blockchain; Information management; Teaching; Innovative solutions; Learning Activity; Level of educations; Operation process; Qualitative method; Research questions; Teaching and learning; University teaching; Learning systems",,,,"12/AKM/PNT/2019","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This study is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Implementasi Blockchain Platform Untuk Menciptakan “Good Governance” pada Perguruan Tinggi” or “The Implementation of Blockchain Platform to Create“Good Governance” in Higher Education” with contract number: 12/AKM/PNT/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","Ari, S., (2015) Perguruan Tinggi Harus Waspadai Transkrip Nilai Palsu-Tribun Jogja, , https://jogja.tribunnews.com/2015/01/09/perguruan-tinggi-haruswaspadai-transkrip-nilai-palsu, jogja.

In this part, the phenomena evolved in many countries. In line with this, early research reported the impact of learning using social media by researchers, both positive and negative impact on the university student. However, the researchers encountered demanding effort to obtain the research report on the causal impact of university student background, such as academic achievement, terms, and student social media behavioural activities. This ceaseless research attempts to explore the gap attributed. Therefore, this quantitative and causal or explanatory research will convey the social media impact of behavioural use for the learning of university student. The research involved 336 university students as the respondent in this research. Technically, SPPS application is used to process the data with Correlation Bivariate technique. The research found 29 correlations regarding the university student background and the activities of using media social for learning and a debatable result emerged from early research eventually. © 2020 IEEE.","Explanatory research; Quantitative method; Social media; Social media for learning; SPSS bivariate","Information management; Social networking (online); Academic achievements; Bivariate; Learning media; Research reports; Social media; University students; Students",,,,,,"Syed Ahmed, M., Kabir, S.M.A., The acceptance of smartphone as a mobile learning tool: Students of business studies in Bangladesh (2018) Malaysian Online J.

The fact, many companies have failed to implement ERP which is proven to be not go live on time, so that the implementation value is to be very expensive. For this reason, it is important to consider other methods that can reduce failures in implementing ERP that are reviewed from the perspective of readiness assessment. Based on previous research, there are some challenging on the ERP readiness assessment. We also found that some areas on the ERP readiness that still not explore more serious such as ERP and agile method. Therefore, based on the challenging and open are on the ERP readiness, we will explore more development the framework of ERP readiness assessment using agile parameters to help the industry. The purpose of this research is to identify gaps and propose improvements which are the weaknesses in order to improve performance of the organization. The result of this research is developing the framework using an agile parameter for determination of the ERP readiness assessment with a case study in the textile industry in Indonesia. Hopefully, this research has contribution as a measurement tool for assessing the organizational readiness in order to increase agility in the industry. This research methodology uses the combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods using the NVivo software as a result of FGD data processing and using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity (TOPSIS) for validation and verification tests. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Nowadays, many companies are turning to freelancing rather than hiring full-time employees. In addition, the workers have also switched to working as freelancers. New problems also arise in the crowdwork system. Trust is one of the main issues that arise in the crowdwork system. It happens because the job providers and workers do not meet each other on the crowdwork portal. This research aims to examine the components that affect trust in a crowdwork system. The benefit is that stakeholders can be aware of how to increase trust in the crowdwork system. The method used in this research is systematic literature review, by analyzing Scopus based journals related to trust in the crowdwork system. This research produces 11 components and 38 indicators. There are three components that needs concern to stakeholders who want to take advantage of crowdwork systems and focus on trust. These components are reciprocal voting, monetary reward, and cognitive effort. The platform should enable stakeholders to have reciprocal voting, less cognitive effort, as well as clean and clear monetary reward procedure. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Distribution process carried out the process of acquisition, purchase, storage, distribution, transport, repackaging, re-labeling, documentation, and record-keeping practices. The problems that occur in the validation process of each distribution process in each party involved are not well registered and integrated with each other, so in the complex drug distribution environment, the monitoring process becomes a necessity every time more urgent and primary to reduce theft, prevent counterfeiting, and improve efficiency, synchronization, visibility, and safety. Providing good tracking of goods gives consumers greater interest in the consumption of goods that meet certain ecological and ethical standards and thus requires the quality of the goods consumed. In this thought, it aims to discuss the best blockchain models for the drug distribution process. This research is qualitative research. As a result, the model was introduced as a potential blockchain model and could be applied in pharmaceutical companies in Indonesia.

Based on data from the Ministry of Tourism in Indonesia, it turns out that the potential tourist category originated from the cluster of college students or school-aged cohort. In this line, social media signifies a similar age of internet user based on the Indonesian Internet Service Provider Association (IISPA). In this sense, previous research underlined that all students are active users of the smartphone. Therefore, this study aims to explore how smartphones influence the student's daily utilization in supporting applications of e-Tourism based in Indonesia. The study was conducted using descriptive analysis, causal or explanatory research and SPSS as a tool of data analysis. Operationally, the Bivariate technique serves as the means to answer research questions. As a result, this study revealed 18 relationships that affect students in utilizing smartphones for e-Tourism activities in Indonesia.

Inspired by the concept of parasocial interaction, the authors researched whether parasocial interaction could be used by universities to build a closer relationship with prospective students. Three different constructs of parasocial interaction were researched, to gauge their effect on a prospective student's intention to enrol in a university and share information by electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM): 1) perceived interactivity; 2) openness; 3) knowledge. Data collection was done by surveying 311, 12th grade students in Indonesia, and processed using partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS SEM). The results showed that parasocial interaction has a positive and significant impact on prospective students' intention to enrol in universities and encourage information sharing through eWOM. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Electronic word-of-mouth; EWOM; Parasocial interaction; PLS SEM; Prospective students; Universities",,,,,,"Bruno Sablan is a faculty member in the School of Information Systems and English Department at the Bina Nusantara University.

Where this time, raising problems one of the social distancing that affects a service provided, especially on services that use technology that applies SST. This study develops from previous research where the customer has satisfaction in using SST services. Still, this use does not know a person intention to use SST services, so it is necessary to develop with several factors the adoption of technology, namely influence that can make a person intention to use. The research framework of this research consists of several factors and indicators, namely efficiency (4 indicators), Reliability (4 indicators), security (3 indicators), Convenience (3 indicators), Ease of use (4 indicators). This study uses an online survey with google form for users of self-service technology services in 5 major cities in Indonesia. Dissemination of the survey for three months, and the obtained were 100 respondents valid. This research conducts testing using Smarpls v3.0. The results of this study found two factors that influence perceived usefulness, namely: efficiency and reliability, and found three factors that did not have an impact, namely Security factors, Convenience Factors, Perceived Ease of use, and Service Trust do not have an impact on perceived usefulness. This result is a very interesting finding because during the period pandemic COVID-19. These factors are no longer the top priority in the use of SST services and do not affect who intention to use a technology service. Thus, it can be concluded that whose intention at a certain level of the problem will prioritize the reliability and efficiency of the system for service. This factor can be the focus of the company in developing systems that adopt Self-service technology. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

It takes a place that can channel the hidden knowledge into new knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to find out the mapping of community learning in informal education to support learning communities. Some of the previous studies of Learning Community were able to create smart, skilled, independent and competitiveness communities with learning programs at formal education. The internet community and media make a distance not an obstacle for people who exchange ideas. The power of bonding makes people help each other like families who have the same responsibilities. Community-based learning becomes an alternative in the future, where conventional learning will gradually be abandoned. Learning Community in the context of informal education is an alternative for busy individuals and it is difficult to find time to share knowledge. The method used is by survey method by defining the scope in detail, and determining the research question; do a search that involves selecting literary sources based on keywords, and determine inclusion and exclusion criteria to sort the types of references for further exploration. Community-based learning has unique things related to the learning process that is not possessed by formal education, among others, the interaction between community members, collaboration in sharing knowledge, quick feedback in solving problems, and self-reflection that often expresses opinions. unthinkable, the creation of actualization, problem-solving and learning by doing as well as learning community learning can also be done with experience-based learning. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Surveys; Community learning; Experience-based learning; Explicit knowledge; Inclusion and exclusions; Informal educations; Internet communities; Learning community; Research questions; E-learning",,,,,,"Zavratnik, V., Kos, A., Stojmenova Duh, E., Smart villages: Comprehensive review of initiatives and practices (2018) Sustainability, 10 (7), p. 2559; Haron, H., Aziz, N.H.N., Harun, A., A conceptual model participatory engagement within e-learning community (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 116, pp. 242-250; Mundschenk, N.A., Fuchs, W.W., Professional learning communities: An effective mechanism for the successful implementation and sustainability of response to intervention (2016) SRATE Journal, 25 (2), pp. 55-64; Iverson, J.O., McPhee, R.D., Knowledge management in communities of practice: Being true to the communicative character of knowledge (2002) Management Communication Quarterly, 16 (2), pp. 259-266; Crowe, K., D'Andrade, A., Engaging community members in providing support for the dying and the bereaved: Activities in social work community practice (2018) Families in Society, 99 (4), pp. 338-346; Keeble, L., Loader, B., Community informatics (2001) Community Informatics.

In the digital era, the use of mobile banking is a utility function for the need to perform daily financial activities such as bill payment and fund transfer. Addressing potential fraud in mobile banking services is a challenge for banks to make IT security systems remain confident, integrity, and available. Potential attacks on IT security will occur from the internal side of the organization as well as from external parties. In maintaining the level of security and convenience of customers in using e-banking services, banks try to make a tool to be able to prevent the occurrence of a large risk of loss in future. The most potential that will become an attack is social engineering and data theft by internal employees, in this research the focus is to discuss the two potential attacks on accounts that have long been dormant and deal with them with an application with the SOA approach. © 2019 IEEE.","application; fraud detection; Service Oriented Architecture (SOA); smart mobile","Applications; Electronic commerce; Information services; Security of data; Security systems; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Confidential data; Financial activity; Financial information; Fraud detection; Mobile applications; smart mobile; Social engineering; Utility functions; Crime",,,,,,"King, B., (2010) Bank 2.0: How Customer Behavior and Technology Will Change the Future of Financial Services, , Banker (1st ed.).

However, the message in social media is effortless to fabricate and may cause potential loss of the image of a person, product image, or company reputation. In this line, there are three forms of the social media message, i.e. text message form, audiovisual/video message form, and the visual/picture message form. On this background, this study aims to explore the reliance influence factor on the message that disseminates through social media. The result of this preliminary study contributes to future marketing research. However, the contemporary university student is the most active user of social media in Indonesia.

In its development, many banking companies or those outside have taken the initiative to make mobile banking services more useful for all customers or their use. Therefore, it is necessary to understand what factors influence the customer's intention to adopt mobile banking with a smartphone. For this reason, development is needed in making conceptual models. This development of conducting a literature review is very important to expand the theory found scientifically. It is evaluated from instruments developed by testing validity and reliability using smart pls 2.0 and using the snowball sampling technique for sampling respondents. Distribution of instruments is done with Google Form. Data collected 258 respondents, and valid respondent data obtained 240 respondents to use. The results of this study are conceptual models that have seven variables: security, confidentiality, Perceived trust, Perceived of use smartphones, mobile banking services, the use of mobile banking and the development of instruments producing 39 instruments. The reliability test with Cronbach's alpha value above 0.5 and AVE value above 0.6. Validity test with a cross-loading value above 0.6, which value stated that the instrument was eligible to collect data from a larger survey in this study. © 2019 IEEE.","Adoption; Conceptual model; Mobile Banking; Smartphone","Instrument testing; Sales; Adoption; Conceptual model; Cronbach's alphas; Customer behavior; Literature reviews; Mobile bankings; Reliability test; Sampling technique; Smartphones",,,,,,"Singh, S., Srivastava, R.K., Predicting the intention to use mobile banking in India (2018) Int.

Design/methodology/approach: Data collection is done by using a quantitative approach through an online questionnaire. This study involved 211 respondents who were internet users in Indonesia who had signed an e-petition. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling approach with IBM Amos version 22.0. Findings: The findings revealed that there are three factors shaping internet users’ attitudes toward e-petitions, namely, altruism, AQ and personal relevance, of which altruism was the strongest factor. Those who have a positive attitude toward e-petitions seemed to have higher intention to sign e-petitions. Additionally, we discovered that internet users believe credible e-petition initiators deliver better arguments, which drive them to sign e-petitions. Research limitations/implications: The finding related to elaboration likelihood model has revealed that not only the dual processing of central routes and peripheral routes but also the possibility of peripheral routes influencing the factors in the central route. Hence, future studies need to include the examination of this relation. Finally, altruism is identified as the major factor that influences people to sign e-petitions. Therefore, people should be aware of this factor while examining the environment that likely has voluntary aspects. Practical implications: To improve the adoption of the e-petition system, it is important for the e-petition websites to maintain attitude factors to achieve the e-petition goals. It is also important that e-petition websites provide credibility information of the e-petition initiators and make it visible to everyone. The e-petition sites must be able to be personalized so that users can be categorized based on their profiles or interests. Finally, as altruism is the most influencing factor in shaping internet users’ attitude toward e-petitions, e-petition initiators need to write a persuasive and arousing information and images for their e-petition. Some templates, tips or even online training to persuasive public petitions also need to be provided. Originality/value: This study attempts to fill the research gap by examining factors from three domains, i.e. information source (the e-petitioners), information/AQ and personal perspective (personal motivation) of the e-petition signers. The authors enrich the research model with altruism factors that influence attitude in signing petitions. This study illustrates the characteristic of Indonesian internet user’s and provides important implications for how the e-petitions site should improve the functionality of the sites. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Altruism; Argument quality; E-petition; Intention to sign; Personal relevance; Source credibility",,,,,,"Funded by : Kementerian Riset Teknologi Dan Pendidikan Tinggi Republik Indonesia PDUPT Grants.","Ajzen, I., From intentions to actions: a theory of planned behavior (1985) Action Control: From Cognition to Behavior, pp. 11-39. , Springer, Berlin Heidelberg; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Alathur, S., Ilavarasan, P., Gupta, M., Citizen participation and effectiveness of e-petition: Sutharyakeralam – India (2012) Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy, 6 (4), pp. 392-403; Allison, T., Davis, B., Webb, J., Short, J., Persuasion in crowdfunding: an elaboration likelihood model of crowdfunding performance (2017) Journal of Business Venturing, 32 (6), pp. 707-725; Angst, C.M., Agarwal, R., Adoption of electronic health records in the presence of privacy concerns: the elaboration likelihood model and individual persuasion (2009) MIS Quaterly, pp. 339-370; Armitage, C.J., Christian, J., From attitudes to behavior: basic and applied research on the theory of planned behavior (2004) Planned Behavior: The Relationship between Human Thought and Action, , p. 7., Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NJ; Batara, E., Nurmandi, A., Warsito, T., Pribadi, U., Are government employees adopting local e-government transformation?

Productivity is a demand for improving organizational performance. ERP systems are a way to increase productivity. Therefore, ERP implementation is important to ensure that ERP runs well. Critical factors in ERP implementation must get serious attention to project management. Even so, the reality of ERP implementation is slowly, even tends to experience failure, resulting in highly expensive. The previous research that carried out ERP implementation showed that the failure reached 40%, and the achievement of the benefits of ERP implementation in Indonesia is still not optimal. It can be said that ERP implementation is a complexity project. For this reason, it is necessary to consider other implementation methods that can overcome the problem in implementing ERP. An agile method is a proactive and reactive alternative to handle the problem in implementing of ERP. The development of an agile ERP model is one way to achieve success in ERP implementation. This research methodology is a survey approach to the study of literature. This research will propose an agile ERP model which will be used as an effective guide for achieving the success of ERP implementation. © 2019 IEEE.","agile ERP model; agile method; ERP implementation","Information management;

In the other angle, passenger's safety, especially for female passenger, has become issues. In this scope, several new findings reported the victim of female passengers. From that lesson, National Police advises the OTC to perform the physiological test for the driver due to security concern. Therefore, the research explored the relationship between the risk factor of the online transportation system for female passenger. In this study, SPSS is used to find the correlation bivariate function and to explain how extent the correlation of risk factor with the passenger background is.

To avoid fraud, it can be done by blockchain technology by the use of University, Company, Traceability, Profit and Policy-making of crypto-governance. Crypto-governance is able to use IBM using hyperledger fabric protocol and private blockchain network. Muhammadiyah Tangerang University (UMT) saved the graduate documents storage manually by human resources. Moreover, it would be wasting time for many tasks, for example when staffs searched database, they would consume a lot of time and the graduate documents were vulnerable to damage in the disaster. Based on the problems above it would face the research questions; how did we keep the graduate documents storage secure and how it could be authentic guaranteed? Blockchain technology with distributed ledger and consensus is considered to overcome this problem. There were 5 steps taken in this research starting from discussing, literature review, analyzing, learning blockchain technology, creating system model and making a conclusion.

This research evaluates the implementation of the Financial Accounting and Control (FICO) ERP system in one of Indonesian state-owned enterprises by identifying the factors such as individual characteristics, organizational characteristics, and technological characteristics that affect the perceived usefulness and the perceived ease of use of the ERP system, as well as how they in turn affect the intention to use, the usage, and its individual impacts. This research utilizes the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to measure the users' acceptance of an ERP system, which is then analyzed using the Structured Equation Model-Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS) data analysis model. The results of the research show that partially there are exogenous variables that significantly affect the endogenous variables such as perceived ease of use of ERP against perceived usefulness of ERP, the intention to use and the perceived usefulness of ERP, complexity and compatibility against perceived ease of use of ERP, intention to use against usage, usage against individual performance, and usage against individual performance and panoptic empowerment. Simultaneously, the research also shows a significant influence. Therefore, in order to measure the users' acceptance rate of an ERP system, then all the exogenous variables, as well as perceived usefulness of ERP, perceived ease of use of ERP, intention to use, usage of ERP, and individual impact which consists of panoptic empowerment and individual performance has to be performed. © 2018 IEEE.","Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP); Evaluation; Financial Accounting and Control (FICO); Implementation","Finance; Least squares approximations; Resource allocation; Enterprise resource planning (ERP); Enterprise resource planning systems; Evaluation; Financial accounting; Implementation; Organizational characteristics; Structured equation modeling; Technological characteristics; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,,"Dantes, G.R., Hasibuan, Z.A., The impact of enterprise resource planning (ERP) system implementation on organization: Case study erp implementation in Indonesia (2011) IBIMA Bu5inass Review Journal, 2011, p. 110; Xu, Y., Yeh, C.-H., Evaluating critical strategies for enterprise resource planning systems implementation Proc. of the 2009 Second International Sympo5ium on Electronic Commerce and Security, , http:www.ieee.org, 22-24 May 2009, Nanchang City, China IEEE Xplore [accessed: 29 Jan. 2017]; Monk, E., Wagner, B., (2013) Concepts in Enterprtse Re5ource Planning (4th Cdi.

This concept has been widely used in the educational world. Many universities are starting to change the way of learning by incorporating elements of the game and using different learning tools that have game elements in the learning process. Therefore, this article will further discuss which elements of the game have been used most in gamification learning and the impact of applying gamification learning to students. This study used systematic literature review approach using articles published in 2014-2018.

Safety, health, happiness and independence will be difficult for them to get even the elderly will be further away from the surrounding environment. Based on population projection 2017 data there are 23.66 million elderly people in Indonesia and predicted in 2020 there are 27.08 million people elderly. Smart homes that are currently widely studied have not focused on elderly; most smart homes only provide a sense of security and convenience for adult residents. And this will be a problem that until now has not solved the improvement of human life through technology to get happiness, care and health especially for the elderly. In many cases of the elderly, it is easier to send them to live in a nursing home and that keeps them separated from their families for the rest of their lives. That's what makes them less happiness. Orange Technology is a collection of technological elements to improve human life by getting happiness, Care and health. This study reviewed the journals of scientific databases such as IEEE explore, ACM digital library and Proquest published from 2002 to 2017. From the search results obtained 54 papers that will answer the scientific questions of this research. The result of this research is a framework of smart house that has Sensor, Monitoring, Wireless, Scalability, Low cost, GPS and ease of installation and maintenance as components of smart house of orange technology for elderly. © 2018 IEEE.","Components of orange technology; Orange Technology; Smart house for elderly and disabled; smart technology","Automation; Costs; Digital libraries; Health; Houses; Intelligent buildings; Pattern recognition; Population statistics; Elderly people; Home environment; Nursing homes; Orange technologies; Scientific database; Sense of security; Smart technology; Surrounding environment; Citrus fruits",,,,,,"Abascal, J., Bonail, B., Marco, A., Casas, R., Sevillano, J.L., AmbienNet: An intelligent environment to support people with disabilities and elderly people (2008) Proc. 10th Int.

In this point, the transaction raises several new and crucial challenges. At a closer look, the concerns appeared due to no data integration, verification, and validation from parties both inside or outside of the university. In this respect, the data is not centralized or integrated. As this backdrop, this causes repeated data confirmation, and no one can authenticate the data validity when distributed to other parties. In this point of entry, the diploma certification forgery has become one of the significant issues in education in Indonesia. As a framework that enables the data integration, Blockchain contains verified data on every single of a transaction, so the data is trustworthy. With this in mind, this paper aims to discuss the best blockchain model for the university level. This study is qualitative-based research. As a result, McRhys model is introduced as a potential and implementable blockchain model in university in Indonesia. © 2019 IADIS Press.

Based on this fact, many organizations take an opportunity to utilize social media as an additional channel to engage with their stakeholders. Social learning is one of the implementations of social media technology in higher education institution to collaborate with teaching and learning strategies. Many higher education institutions decide to involve social learning concept into their teaching and learning process because of the shifting generation of student, which most students today use social media to interact with each other. Based on this phenomenon, this study tried to compare the different impacts between e-learning as in condition and social learning system into learning outcome. In this study, authors divided two groups to test the linkages under different situations (social learning and e-learning systems) using sampling groups to draw the impact of these systems. This study is addressed to identify the influence of different channel learning media and to assess the influence into several output variables, which are participation, performance, and engagement. Moreover, concepts from information systems, education, and human behavior have been used with literature to the adoption of social learning systems. The result of this research has practical implications for higher education institution that is interested to implement social learning systems in their teaching and learning strategies. © 2018, ICIC International.

Therefore, ERP system is important strategy for organization's survival. One of the critical issues that affect a successful ERP implementation is the implementation method. In previous research, it showed that many organizations had faced complexity when they were implementing ERP in order to meet their requirements. In other cases, the ERP systems are unable to provide solution which is a simplicity of the necessary business processes. The ERP implementation complexity is one of the factors that lead the failures. Thus, here, we intend to propose an agile approach to reduce complexity and eventually our intention is to improve ERP implementing to become more successful. In this study, we are employing a systematic literature review (SLR) approach to identify the principles factors of the agile methods for ERP implementation. In result of employing this SLR method, we found that agile values and principles are correlated in ERP implementation complexity. © 2018 IEEE.","agile methods; complexity; ERP implementation; systematic literature review","Agile manufacturing systems; Information management; Agile approaches; Agile methods; Business environments; Business Process; complexity; ERP implementation; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Enterprise resource planning",,,,,,"Alleman, G.B., Agile project management methods for ERP: How to apply agile processes to complex COTS projects and live to tell about it (2002) Conference on Extreme Programming and Agile Methods, , Springer; Amid, A., Moalagh, M., Ravasan, A.Z., (2012) Identification and classification of ERP critical failure factors in Iranian industries; Ali, M., Miller, L., Erp system implementation in large enterprises-A systematic literature review (2017) Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 30, p. 4; Baig, J.J.A., Shah, A., Sajjad, F., Evaluation of agile methods for quality assurance and quality control in ERP implementation (2017) Intelligent Computing and Information Systems (ICICIS), 2017 Eighth International Conference on, pp. 252-257. , IEEE; Bansal, V., Negi, T., A metric for ERP complexity (2008) International Conference on Business Information Systems, pp. 369-379. , Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg; Baramichai, M., Zimmers, E.W., Jr., Marangos, C.A., Agile supply chain transformation matrix: An integrated tool for creating an agile enterprise.

Trust will be viewed through four aspects, namely, cognition-based trust, personality-oriented trust, affect-based trust and experience–based trust. Then, these antecedents of trust were examined as the factors of continuance intention by extending the expected confirmation theory (ECT). Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through a quantitative approach, and 389 respondents were involved in the study. The respondents are the investors who represent their organization which uses e-government service to report their investment activities to the Investment Coordinating Board of Indonesia. Data were analyzed using partial least square structural equation modelling approach with WarpPLS 4.0. Findings: The result shows that factors that determine a user’s trust in government online service are service quality, trust towards government entity, recommendation to use the service and user’s habit of using the service. Factors that do not determine a user’s trust in government online service is a disposition to trust. Another finding is that a user’s trust on an online service does not directly influence his/her continuance of use. Trust will impact the continuance of use through perceptions of benefits and perceived satisfaction of using the online service. Research limitations/implications: ECT is applicable in G2B process. Organizations have a perception of benefit while using a public e-service and confirm the perception through their experience while using an e-service to gain satisfaction, and this will encourage them to continue using the service. Practical implications: To improve organizations’ trust on the e-service, the government needs to improve the e-service quality (by evaluating the efficiency, privacy, user support, reliability and information quality), investor familiarity of the system (training or socialization), investor trust on the government entity (improve the employee competence) and recommendation on using the system. Originality/value: Trust dimension has also been studied to be a factor that influences the intention or continuance of use of technology; however, it has rarely been studied towards its effect in the ECT’s context. In e-government study, there are various studies related to government-to-citizen (G2C) concept. However, the research in government-to-business (G2B) area that has not been explored much. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","E-government; Expectation confirmation theory; G2B; Government-to-business; The continuance of use; Trust",,,,,":287/UN2.R3.1/HKP05.00/ 2018","This study is financed and supported by Ministry of Higher Education Indonesia, specifically from the PDUPT Grant, 2018, “Studi Pengembangan Integrated E-Participation Platform Sebagai Upaya Peningkatan Partisipasi Publik Melalui Media Sosial di Indonesia” (No:287/UN2.R3.1/HKP05.00/ 2018).","Abu Shanab, E., Antecedents of trust in e-government services: an empirical test in Jordan (2014) Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy, 8 (4), pp. 480-499; Alruwaie, M., El-Haddadeh, R., Weerakkody, V., A framework for evaluating citizens’ expectations and satisfaction toward continued intention to use e-government services (2012) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 7443, pp. 273-286. , Scholl, H.J., Janssen, M., Wimmer, M.A., Moe, C.E. and Flak, L.S., and,(Eds), Electronic Government, EGOV 2012, Springer, Berlin; Alsaghier, H., Ford, M., Nguyen, A., Hexel, R., Conceptualising citizen’s trust in e-Government: application of Q methodology (2009) Electronic Journal of e-Government, 7 (4), pp. 295-310; Alzahrani, L., Al-Karaghouli, W., Weerakkody, V., Analysing the critical factors influencing trust in e-government adoption from citizens’ perspective: a systematic review and a conceptual framework (2017) International Business Review, 26 (1), pp. 164-175; Belanche, D., Casalo, L.V., Flavian, C., Schepers, J., Trust transfer in the continued usage of public e-services (2014) Information and Management, 51 (6), pp. 627-640; Bélanger, F., Carter, L., Trust and risk in e-government adoption (2008) The Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 17 (2), pp. 165-176; Bhattacherjee, A., Understanding information systems continuance: an expectation-confirmation model (2001) MIS Quarterly, 25 (3), pp. 351-370; Chen, J.V., Jubilado, R.J.M., Capistrano, E.P.S., Yen, D.C., Factors affecting online tax filing – an application of the IS success model and trust theory (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, 43, pp. 251-262; Davis, F.D., Bagozzi, R.P., Warshaw, P.R., (1989) User Acceptance of Computer Technology: A Comparison of Two Theoretical Models, , Management science; Gefen, D., E-commerce: the role of familiarity and trust (2000) The International Journal of Management Science, 28 (6), pp. 725-737; Gefen, D., Karahanna, E., Straub, D.W., Trust and TAM in online shopping: an integrated model (2003) MIS Quarterly, 27 (1), pp. 51-90; Gulati, G.J., Yates, D.J., Tawileh, A., Towards e-participation in the Middle East and Northern (2010) Comparative e-Government, pp. 71-91. , Reddick C.G.

This brings a successfully decreasing in the amount of baggage mishandling. SITA 2017 reported that during 10 years until 2016 there is increasing of airline passengers, but decreasing in the amount of mishandled baggage. Many people believe that this great achievement was caused by IT implementation in baggage handling system in airport, including the massive use of RFID for baggage identification tool. Indonesia as one of the countries with the largest population had a significant increasing amount of air passengers and their baggage, that is 15% from 2015 to 2016. Until now this huge number of air baggage is stil manually handled, so Indonesia is facing a serious problem of handling the huge amount of baggage that keep growing. This paper is a preliminary literature study to iniate the development of RFID based baggage handling system in Indonesia.

Community colleges and schools seek to complement the traditional teaching system with e-learning systems. However, we found there are differences in individual learning styles in terms of speed and learning styles. Serving or teaching students with one mechanism of the same teaching method will ignore individual rights while reducing the meaning of education broadly from the humanity dimension. Such situations will affect the target of increasing competence, the growth of knowledge and the value expected for some individuals to fail. The electronic learning model then undergoes a shift away from a mere system, now evolving into a personalized learning model, where learning processes are oriented toward the students' abilities. Under these conditions, models and other techniques are needed to help personalized adaptive learning as they need it. The purpose of this study was to identify the general criteria of personalized electronic learning model to meet the needs, interests and objectives of the learner in a more personal sense in a broader sense. This research was conducted through literature study on papers published in the last five years (2012-2017). The results show the common components, techniques or tools that are commonly used, as well as the support of the theoretical basis used as the platform for the development of a personalized e-learning model. © 2017 IEEE.","Architecture; Component; E-learning; Framework; Model; Personalized","Architecture; Developing countries; Education computing; Information management; Learning systems; Models; Teaching; Component; Framework; Information technology application; Personalized; Personalized e-learning; Personalized learning; Systematic literature review; Traditional teachings; E-learning",,,,,,"Wan, S., Niu, Z., A learner oriented learning recommendation approach based on mixed concept mapping and immune algorithm (2016) Knowledge-Based Syst., 103, pp. 28-40; Laksitowening, K.A., Hasibuan, Z.A., Personalized e-learning architecture in standard-based education (2015) Proc.-2015 Int.

One of the tools that can be used to bridge between graduates and companies is an integrated career portal. This portal can be optimized to help industry find the employees they need from the alumni from university. On the other hand, this tool can help graduates to get job that suits their competency. By using the portal, alumni can hopefully minimize the number of unemployed university graduates and accelerate their absorption into job market. The development of this career portal will use agile methodology. Questionnaire was distributed to alumni and employers to collect information about what user need in the portal. The result of this research can create a career portal which integrated business process and social media. © 2017 IEEE.","agile methodology; e-Business; integrated career portal; social media","Employment; Information management; Social networking (online); Agile Methodologies; eBusiness; Industry sectors; Integrated business; Job market; Social media; University graduates; User need; Commerce",,,,,,"(2017) Education Indicators in Focus, , http://www.oecd.org/edu/skills-beyondschool/educationindicatorsinfocus.htm, (August 11).

Environmental pollution topic split into several subtopics namely air pollution, water pollution and soil pollution. The composing of lesson plans were developed based on socio-scientific issues with five stages, namely (1) Motivate; (2) Challenge; (3) Collect scientific evidence; (4) Analyse the evidence; (5) Build knowledge and make connections; and (6) Use evidence. While student worksheets contain articles on socio-scientific issues, practice, and there are a few questions to determine students' reasoning. The method that is used in this research is research and development (R & D method). Development model used in this study is a model of Plomp that consists of four stages, namely: (1) Initial Research; (2) Design; (3) Realization or Construction; (4) Testing, evaluation and revision; (5) Implementation, while the research was limited to the fourth stage. Lesson plans and student worksheets based on socio-scientific issues was validated through an expert validation. The result showed that lesson plans and student worksheets based socio-scientific issues on pollution theme have a very decent and be able to apply in science classroom. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Education computing; Planning; Pollution; Soil pollution; Teaching; Water pollution; Development model; Environmental pollutions; Is researches; Junior high schools; Lesson plans; Science classroom; Scientific evidence; Socio-scientific issues; Students",,,,,,"Their, D., (2002) The New Science Literacy: Using Language Skill to Help Students Learn Science, , (Portsmounth: Reed Elsevier Inc); Trianto, (2010) Mendesain Model Pembelajaran Inovatif Progresif, , (Jakarta: Kencana Prenada Media Group); Arsyad, A., (2009) Media Pembelajaran, , (Jakarta: PT.

The approach involves integrating SERVQUAL method, Kano Model and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) for measuring HIS quality attributes that are adopted from DeLone & McLean IS Success Model dimensions from the users' perspective. This research shows the low user satisfaction level towards the current HIS quality, and then the attributes required for betterment are subsequently identified.

Today there are a variety of tools used to communicate with stakeholder (supplier, customer, distributor, etc) in boundless place, so organizations' data will be kept in the various devices. The changing of this era drives the current trend of employees using their own laptop computers, cellular phones, smart phones, tablet, etc; both for personal and for work. However to successfully implement BYOD, the problems associated with privacy and security in BYOD environment should be identified. According to this circumstance, this study aims to identify some of the legal issues related to security and privacy challenge in BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) era, which can be a suggestion for institution to aware with these issues because security and privacy is the most important to any size of organization to run their business process. © 2016 IEEE.","BYOD; privacy challenge; security","Digital storage; Information management; Laptop computers; Personal computers; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Bring your own devices; Business Process; BYOD; Cellular Phone; Privacy and security; security; Security and privacy; Systematic literature review; Computer privacy",,,,,,"Eslahi, M., Naseri, M.V., Hashim, H., Tahir, N.M., Saad, E.H.M., BYOD: Current state and security challenges (2015) ISCAIE 2014-2014 IEEE Symp.

From many perspectives particularly for educational, it is interesting to examine how social media can contribute to the learning process. This channel can support an interactive process that occurs when a group of learners collaborates with other to combine their knowledge into new insights. This research focuses on identifying social learning factors framework that enable higher education to be sustainable and be more adaptive. It also depicts conceptual social learning ontology according to Zachman Framework for enhancing collaboration and increasing responsiveness by leveraging social media channel in higher education. The objective of this study is to support classification scheme for descriptive representations of the social learning model. That is not only doing the design artifacts, but it depicts all supportive components to the organizational perspective. This set of view appears to be universal of the subject or object being described, including what (data), how (function), where (network), who (people), when (time), and why (motivation). The primary method of this study is systematic literature review process to define social learning factors that can be mapped into Zachman Framework.

The research model was developed by integrating the concept of DeLone and McLean's information systems (IS) success model with the expectation confirmation model. To examine the developed model, a survey was conducted with 131 respondents from three companies that had implemented a KMS. The data were analyzed using the partial least square (PLS) method. The study demonstrated that both system quality and information/knowledge quality influence all the factors that drive the continuance intention regarding KMS usage, namely perceived usefulness, satisfaction, and trust. Moreover, satisfaction proved to have an impact on users' recommendation intention concerning the KMS. Therefore, companies should improve the KMS quality in order to drive employees to continuously use the KMS and recommend it to others.","Continuance intention; Expectation confirmation model; IS success model; Knowledge management; Knowledge management systems; Knowledge quality; Post adoption behavior; System quality",,,,,,,"Abdelrahman, M., Papmichail, K.N., French, S., Knowledge management system's characteristics that facilitate knowledge sharing to support decision making processes in multinational corporations (2011) Proceedings of the AMCIS, 2011; Alavi, M., Leidner, D.E., Knowledge management and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Quarterly, 25 (1), pp. 107-136; Bailey, J.E., Pearson, S.W., Development of a tool for measuring and analyzing computer user satisfaction (1983) Management Science, 29 (5), pp. 530-545; Basten, D., Schneider, L., Michalik, B., Knowledge contribution motivators - An expectation-confirmation approach (2013) Proceedings of the Thirty-Fourth International Conference on Information Systems, , Milan, Italy; Becerra-Fernandez, I., Sabherwal, R., (2010) Knowledge Management: Systems and Processes, , New York, NY: M.E Sharpe, Inc; Belanger, F., Hiller, J.S., Smith, W.J., Trustworthiness in electronic commerce: The role of privacy, security, and attributes (2002) Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 11 (3-4), pp. 245-270; Bera, P., Wand, Y., A framework to clarify the role of knowledge management systems (2009) Proceedings of the PACIS 2009; Bhattacherjee, A., Understanding information systems continuance: An expectation-confirmation model (2001) MIS Quarterly, 25 (3), pp. 351-370; Bossen, C., Jensen, L.G., Udsen, F.W., Evaluation of a comprehensive EHR based on the DeLone and McLean model for IS success: Approach, results, and success factors (2013) International Journal of Medical Informatics, 82 (10), pp. 940-953; Casaló, L.V., Flavián, C., Guinalíu, M., The role of satisfaction and website usability in developing customer loyalty and positive (2008) International Journal of Bank Marketing, 26 (6), pp. 399-417. , word-of-mouth in the e-banking services; Chea, S., Luo, M.M., Post-adoption behaviors of e-service customers: The interplay of cognition and emotion (2008) International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 12 (3), pp. 29-56; Chin, W.W., The partial least squares approach to structural equation modeling (1998) Modern Methods for Business Research, pp. 295-336. , G.

The tremendous exposure of social media today has changed a new communication channel for all business process. Although it is for better support or worse, social media is very powerful because many organizations begin to initiate strategies and allocate resources to engage effectively with social media platform. Higher education as organizational learning is expected to concern with this situation because the orientation of education today exposed to students centered learning mechanism to provide them with a holistic learning experience. Social media was realized as an innovative and effective tool to provide innovative ways of involving and motivating students in the learning process. Therefore, there is a need to investigate how students perceive and use social media in providing a pedagogically virtual learning environment that could enhance their learning experience. To achieve the goals of infusing social media into traditional pedagogical approach, the research investigates the preferences channel of social media for collaborative learning in the context of higher education as educational platform. A descriptive survey method used in this evaluation to show the trend in higher education. The result clearly describes social media preferences in the community of higher education so that learners can be actively engaged with learning process and flexible environments for global communication sharing. © 2016 IEEE.","Higher education; preferences; social learning; Social media","Computer aided instruction; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Students; Surveys; Collaborative learning; Descriptive survey method; Higher education; Organizational learning; preferences; Social learning; Social media; Virtual learning environments; Education",,,,,,"Chitiba, C.A., Lifelong learning challenges and opportunities for traditional universities (2012) Procedia-Soc.

Higher education as a place to educate and share knowledge has to realize these phenomena. With social media, organization supports the knowledge sharing process within organization. Then it changes learning mechanism from e-learning into social learning environment. According to this fact, this research will combine the concepts of knowledge management and social learning as a model framework's component by identifying the significant factors and its relationship with social media. A systematic and relevant literature review from journals and textbooks was conducted to support the development of component framework model. As the result, we propose an integrated model of knowledge management with social learning for higher education. © 2016 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.","E-learning; Higher education; Knowledge management;

One of the resources is ornamental fish, both salt water and fresh water fishes. There are at least 240 types of marine or saltwater ornamental fish and 226 types of freshwater ornamental fish. This huge potential and the supporting natural ecosystem open a big opportunity to improve non-petroleum export, especially in the ornamental fish sector. This can be seen from the improving value and production occurred recently. This commodity had a fairly significant growth and has a promising economic prospect. This growth has to be complemented with the infrastructure to sell the fishes to the customer in various countries. One of the infrastructures that can support is information technology and information system. Internet is one of the infrastructures used by 251 million of world population to find information and make an online transaction. Without the internet, all the business activities in the world will be disrupted. This research is focused to create and apply an application to help ornamental fish sellers in Indonesia improve their sales number. The growth on sales number can hopefully improve the income of ornamental fish sales. This e-commerce application can also be used by anyone around the world to sell and buy ornamental fish listed in the application's product catalog. The products offered in the application is not limited to only ornamental fish, but also other fishery tools, equipment, and accessories. © 2015 IEEE.","e-Commerce implementation; fish breeders; ornamental fish; social media","Commerce; Electronic commerce; Internet; Sales; Water; Business activities; E-Commerce applications; E-commerce implementation; Economic prospects; Online transaction; Ornamental fish; Social media; Tropical countries; Fish",,,,,,"Turban, E., King, D., Lee, J., Liang, T.-P., Turban, D., (2012) Electronic Commerce 2012, , 7th edition, Pearson, (references); Laudon, K.C., Traver, C.G., (2012) E-commerce 2012: Business, Technology and Society, , Person.

Therefore, there is improved interest in how to integrate citizens' views on development process of public e-services. Citizens' participation believed to bring value to various system development projects. However, the existing research has shown that introducing user participation (in this case is citizen participation) to public e-service development can be challenging. The study literature review aims to investigate factors that influence citizens' willingness and ability to participate in public e-service development according to three user participation theories: User-centered Design, Participatory Design and User Innovation. The result will gives benefit to the government in understanding the factors that influence citizen participation and also they could build the more appropriate systems that fit into citizens' needs.","Citizen; Public e-service; System development; Systematic literature review; User participation",,,,,,,"Alawneh, A., Al-Refai, H., Batiha, K., Measuring user satisfaction from e-government services:lessons from Jordan (2013) Government Information Quarterly, 30, pp. 277-288; Lin, F., Fofanah, S.S., Liang, D., Assessing citizen adoption of e-government initiatives in Gambia: A validation of the technology acceptance model in information systems success (2011) Government Information Quarterly, 28, pp. 271-279; Sá, F., Rocha, Á., Cota, M.P., Potential dimensions for a local e-government services quality model (2015) Telematics and Informatics, 33, pp. 270-276; Holgersson, Karlsson, Public e-service development: Understanding citizens' conditions for participation (2014) Government Information Quarterly, 31, pp. 396-410; Cegarra-Navarro, J.-G., Pachón, J.R.C., Cegarra, J.L.M., (2012) E-government and Citizen's Engagement with Local Affairs through E-websites: The Case of Spanish Municipalities, 32, pp. 469-478; Karlsson, F., Holgersson, J., Söderström, E., Hedström, K., Exploring user participation approaches in public e-service development (2012) Government Information Quarterly, 29 (2), pp. 158-168; Fedotova, O., Teixeira, L., Alvelos, H., E-participation in Portugal: Evaluation of government electronic platforms (2012) Procedia Technology, 5, pp. 152-161; Al-Hujran, O., Al-Debei, M.M., Chatfield, A., Migdadi, M., The imperative of influencing citizen attitude toward e-government adoption and use (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, 53, pp. 189-203; Lean, O.K., Zailani, S., Ramayah, T., Fernando, Y., Factors influencing intention to use e-government services among citizens in Malaysia (2009) International Journal of Information Management, 29, pp. 458-475; Fakhoury, R., Aubert, B., Citizenship, trust, and behavioural intentions to use public e-services: The case of Lebanon international (2015) Journal of Information Management, 35, pp. 346-351; Ozkan, S., Kanat, I., E.

This research aimed to analyse which factors influence the individual to share knowledge in citizen media. Our research model was organised using stimulus-organismic-response (SOR) framework by focusing stimulus from social and technological environment. The five points Likert scale questionnaire was developed and distributed to 850 Kompasiana's contributors (the largest citizen media platform in Indonesia) via message feature, thus obtaining 295 valid respondents who fill the questionnaire completely. Those data then were analysed by structural equation modelling method using AMOS 22.0. The result shows that both social and technological environment significantly influences the intention to share knowledge.

Design/methodology/approach: Research methodology is started with the hierarchy creation of student engagement with university which then translated into questionnaire. This questionnaire was distributed to 58 universities in Jakarta (Indonesia’s capital). The questionnaire result was analyzed with entropy and TOPSIS method. Findings: In social media implementation quality, information quality is more important than service quality because in social media, a good information quality is really relevant with the usefulness and comprehensiveness of the information. On the other hand regarding service quality, the system availability will help students in their interaction process with university, on top of the service’s efficiency and fulfillment. This directly impacts the cooperation between students, active learning process, and students’ expectation. The social medias students preferred to improve student engagement with universities respectively are LINE, Facebook, Twitter, Wiki, Blog, Instagram, YouTube, Path, LinkedIn, and Podcast. Research limitations/implications: Social media’s role is not only to create student engagement in the learning process, but also other aspects included by Chickering & Gamson (1987). Practical implications: The Social CRM channel shift from electronic into social media shows that social media holds an important role for university since it eases up the communication between university and the students. The good social media management has been an issue that needs to be solved by university by creating a unit or delegate a person that can manage the social media correctly and quickly so the students feel that they get the good service they want. Originality/value: The other researches focus on observing social media influence to improve student engagement, but only in the context of learning process. This research observes social media roles in student engagement thoroughly according to the existing good practice. This research can also shows the order of social media that are seen important to create student engagement. © 2015, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

The use of social media in the Social CRM has changed the role of the company and the customer, which was originally a corporate centric to currently a customer centric. Universities and colleges are a different service company compared to other kind of service companies in general term. Social CRM Framework is needed in this higher education sector because their customers (students) are very expertise in the use of technology. It makes this generation very familiar in utilizing social media. This Social CRM Framework is built on the Enterprise Architecture (EA) framework, results an information system outcome since Enterprise Architecture 672 Meyliana and Eko K. Budiardjo can bridge the speed gap between business changes with the information technology change. The EA used is the Zachman Framework and Architecture of Integrated Information System (ARIS) Framework. The mapping results between Social CRM Frameworks and EA has produces 6 cells, namely the data, time, network, people, function and motivation. This paper discuss how to fill in the function cell and people cell using the Value Chain Process (is called the Higher Education Value Chain) and the APQC Process Classification FrameworkSM approach which is made into business process outcome, then this business process will be described to be business process model and workflow model (organization unit and work product). © 2014 Meyliana and Eko K.

The abundance amount of available data has become a unique challenge for the organisation to manage and process its data to be more useful information. The concept of processing large amounts of data that do not interfere the operational data is called 'Data Warehouse' technology. Data warehouse serves as the basis to build an executive dashboard application that could assist the board of leadership in universities to access information in visual form to accelerate and improve the readability of the information itself. The developers of Executive Dashboard should meet what the board of leadership needs and stick to the information system architecture based that university has. This development method utilizes Key Performance Indicator approach owned by the university. To build a proper executive dashboard, developers need data warehouse that is built through the initial stage of system development life cycle for the data warehouse. Since it is applied to universities, this executive dashboard application is called as the University Dashboard. © 2014 IEEE.","data warehouse; executive dashboard; key performance indicators (KPI); university dashboard","Data warehouses; Decision making; Life cycle; Waste disposal; Competitive markets; Decision making process; executive dashboard; Information system architecture; Key performance indicators; Large amounts of data; System development life cycles; university dashboard; Benchmarking",,,,,,"Zagorecki, A., Ristvej, J., Comfort, L.K., Lovecek, T., Executive dashboard systems for emergency management (2012) Communication Review, 2, pp. 82-89; Garrett, G., How to create a business intelligence strategy (2012) SAS Global Forum 2012, Applied Business Intelligence, pp. 1-8; Velcu-Laitinen, O., Yigitbasioglu, O.M., The use of dashboards in performance management: Evidence from sales managers (2012) The International Journal of Digital Accounting Research, 12, pp. 39-58. , March; Cui, Z., Damiani, E., Leida, M., Benefits of ontologies in real time data access (2007) Digital EcoSystems and Technologies Conference, DEST '07, pp. 392-397. , Inaugural, IEEE-IES, 21-23 February; Dennis, A., Haley Wixom, B., Tegarden, D., (2009) Systems Analysis and Design with UML 2.0 An Object-Oriented Approach, , 3rd edition John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Turban, E., Aronson, J.E., Liang, T., Sharda, R., (2007) Decision Support and Business Intelligence System, p. 209. , 8th edition, Prentice Hall; David, F.R., (2011) Strategic Management Concepts and Cases, , Thirteenth edition, Prentice Hall; Stackowiak, R., Rayman, J., Greenwald, R., (2007) Oracle Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence Solutions, , Wiley Publishing, Inc, Indianapolis; Sauter, V.L., (2010) Decision Support System for Business Intelligence, p. 400. , Second edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Inmon, W.H., (2005) Building the Data Warehouse, p. 21. , Fourth Edition, Wiley publishing Inc; Profil Perguruan Tinggi, , http://forlap.dikti.go.id/, DIKTI, [Online], accessed on January 26th, 2014 - 17.16 pm","Meyliana; School of Information Systems, Bina Nusantara UniversityIndonesia",,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2nd International Conference on Information and Communication Technology, ICoICT 2014","28 May 2014 through 30 May 2014",,114769,,9781479935819,,,"English","Int.

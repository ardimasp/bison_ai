Initially, LPG gas does not smell, but if so it will be difficult to detect if there is a leak in the gas cylinder. The very first action is the human sense of smell so that humans can smell the gas. Then, errors also often occur on the manometer used by the regulator is still analog, so the reading of the gas pressure data is still less accurate. The purpose of this paper is to propose an LPG gas leak detection device using MQ2 sensor and LPG gas pressure measurement using MPX5700 sensor, buzzer as an alarm, led, LCD as a gas pressure information media, and serve as a tool to open the regulator valve when a leak occurs. The average results of each measurement with a good distance and time are used is to refer to the limits of excess levels ie more than 100ppm are found in an average condition of 10 seconds with a distance of 10cm, 15cm, 20cm, and 25cm. The Mean Square Error (MSE) value of the MPX5700DP sensor with the gas regulator being compared is 0.09 for the absence of gas conditions received and 0.61 for the gas conditions that have been received by the sensor, this test is to obtain a more accurate value. © 2020 Little Lion Scientific.

For arch bridge, vibration of hanger due to dynamic action of the bridge has been experienced including hanger vibration of Tayan Bridge. The possible phenomena of the vibration are flutter, galloping and vortex induced vibration. This paper presenting the study of galloping phenomenal on the hanger of the Tayan Bridge. Several shape of the bridge hanger has been considered in this study. Computation Fluid Dynamic has been used to determine the static wind coefficient of the hanger. Glauert-Hartog Criteria has been applied to examine the performance of the bridge hanger to galloping. The result showed that that only circle shape that is not experiencing galloping. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Bridge; Galloping; Hanger; Static Wind Coefficient; Vibration","Bridges; Fluid structure interaction; Flutter (aerodynamics); Vibrations (mechanical); Vortex flow; Computation fluid dynamics; Dynamic actions; Galloping; Hanger; Long-span bridge; Vibration; Vortex induced vibration; Wind coefficients; Arch bridges",,,,,"Made, S., Prasetyo Eko, J., Vibration of Tayan Bri ge's Hanger in West Kalimantan, Indonesia (2019) International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Technology (IJEAT), 8; Xu, Y.L., (2013) Wind Effects on Cable Supported Bridges, pp. 83-103; Keerthana, M., Harikrishna, P., Application of CFD for assessment of galloping of rectangular and H-sections (2013) Journal of Scientific and Industrial Research (JSIR) JSIR, 72, pp. 419-427; Liu, M.G., Mou, T.M., Hua, X.G., Chen, Z.Q., Flutter, galloping, and vortex induced vibrations of h-section hangers (2012) ASCE Journal of Bridge Engineering, 2012, pp. 1-9; Fernando, G., Jose, M., Angel, S., Influence of aerodynamic characteristics of ""h"" beams on galloping stability (2014) IABSE Madrid Symposium Report, 102 (41), pp. 277-284; Emil, S., Scanlan Robert, H., (1985) Wind Effects on Structures, 1986, pp. 198-247","Suangga, M.; Civil Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: suangga@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

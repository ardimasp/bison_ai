E-commerce became an opportunity for company to increase their selling. Electronic payment (e-payment) was developed to facilitate e-commerce transactions beetwen consumer and seller. In this study, we will investigate consumer's intention to use e-payment. The proposed research model was developed by extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) with culture and perceived security into the model, in order to determine the significance factors that influence acceptance of e-payment technology. Through this model, researchers can have a more accurate explanation of the consumer behavior not only in terms of acceptance of the technology, but other factors considered influential on consumers such as culture and perceived security in the origin country. This model will be used to examine consumer's behaviour in Indonesia. © 2015 The Authors.

To ensure that no links are broken there is a need for a link checker testing application. But manual testing requires a lot of resources, expensive cost, and takes a long time to check the whole deployment must be done every day, so in this study the manufacture of link checker testing application will run automatically and integrated with Jenkins. With this application, developers can fix broken links in the development stage before being consumed by the public. Automation link checker testing application is using Jenkins as continuous integration tools, Shell Script, PHP Unit framework and PHP programming language will check all the links in the website automatically and report from the test results. Once compared with manual link checking, the test automation application of this link checker is more accurate and faster than checking links manually. © 2018 Joe Erik Carla Wijaya, Abba Suganda Girsang.","Automation testing; Continuous integration; Jenkins; Link checker; Testing",,,,,,"Pressman, R.S., (2014) ""Software Engineering A Practitioner's Approach (8th Ed.)"", , New York: McGraw Hil; Hossain, M.S., Hosain, M.S., ""Web Test Integration and Perfor-mance Evaluation of E-Commerce Web Sites,"" (2012) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, 10 (9), pp. 65-69; Tassey, G., (2002) ""The economic impacts of inadequate infrastructure for software testing."", , National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Many applications could be accessed anytime and anywhere easily using Internet. Developers need tools to create their applications, one of them named code editor. The purpose of this research is to design and develop a real-time code editor application using web socket technology to help users collaborate while working on the project. This application provides a feature where users can collaborate on a project in real-time. The authors using analysis methodology which conducting on a study of the current code editor applications, distributing questionnaires and conducting on literature study. CodeR is a web application that provides workspace to writing, perform, display the results of the code through the terminal, and collaborate with other users in real-time. The application main features are providing workspace to make, execute and build the source code, real-time collaboration, chat, and build the terminal. This application supports C, C++, and Java programming languages. © 2015 The Authors.

However, it also has a high risk for investors and traders if they are not careful to look the factors that affect the stock market. Therefore, they should give attention to the dynamic fluctuations and movements of the stock market to optimize profits from their investment. In this paper, we present a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model (NARX) to predict the movements of stock market especially the movements of the closing price index. As case study, we consider to predict the movement of the closing price in Indonesia composite index (IHSG) and choose the best structures of NARX for IHSG's prediction which the number of input neurons, neurons in its single layer, feedback delay, input delay and output neuron are 6, 10, 1, 2 and 1, respectively. © 2017 IEEE.","NARX; prediction; stock market; time series","Commerce; Costs; Financial markets; Forecasting; Information systems; Information use; Neurons; Profitability; Time series; Autoregressive exogenous models; Composite index; Feedback delay; Financial sectors; Input neurons; NARX; Output neurons; Single layer; Investments",,,,,"Dash, R., Dash, P.K., A hybrid stock trading framework integrating technical analysis with machine learning techniques (2016) The Journal of Finance and Data Science, 2 (1), pp. 42-57. , March; Alam, M.B., Hossain, M.Z., Hossain, A.M., Islam, M.M., Price prediction of stock market using hybrid model of artificial intelligence (2015) International Journal of Computer Applications, 111 (3), pp. 5-10; Umoh, U.A., Inyang, U.G., A fuzzy-neural intelligent intelligent trading model for f or stock price prediction (2015) International Journal of Computer Science Issues, 12 (3), pp. 36-44; Arbain, S.H., Wibowo, A., Neural networks based nonlinear time series regression for water level forecasting of dungun river (2012) American Journal of Computer Science, , Science Publications; Wibowo, A., Desa, M.I., Kernel based regression and genetic algorithms for estimating cutting conditions of surface roughness in end milling machining process (2012) Expert System with Applications, , Elsevier; Wibowo, A., (2017) Hybrid Kernel Principal Component Regression and A Penalty Strategy of Adaptive Genetic Algorithms for Estimation Optimum Parameters of Abrasive Waterjet Machining, , Accepted in Applied Soft Computing, Elsevier; Hillion, P., Suominen, M., The manipulation of closing prices (2004) Journal of Financial Markets, 7, pp. 351-375; Antolis, T., Dossugi, S., Pengaruh fluktuasi ihsg, inflasi dan suku bunga terhadap imbal hasil unitlink berbasis saham (2008) Journal of Applied Finance and Accounting, Binus Journal, 1 (1), pp. 141-165. , in Bahasa; (2017), https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JKSE/history?period1=1343062800&period2=1488214800&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d, Accessed: 1 July; Cheng, S., Pecht, M., Using cross-validation for model parameter selection of sequencial probability ratio test (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39, pp. 8467-8473; Refaeilzadeh, P., Tang, L., Liu, H., (2008) Cross-validation, , Arizona State University",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2nd International Conferences on Information Technology, Information Systems and Electrical Engineering, ICITISEE 2017","1 November 2017 through 2 November 2017",,134613,,9781538606582,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

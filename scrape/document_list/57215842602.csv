The success component of ERP system success is using DeLone and McLean success model with qualitative method. The research methodology used detail interview with project implementation team, ERP consultants (8 informants) to get more detail from ERP system merging with information and collected supporting data from the ERP system itself. The result shows that ERP System Merging succeed to increase the system quality of Chemical Companywhich acquired two companies into one ERP system. It was depicted by the increment of easiness on using the system. The information much more integrated and accurate after the ERP system merging. Meanwhile service quality was increased because of all incidents now monitored in one efficient log system and handled by experienced IT application support team. © 2020 F. L.

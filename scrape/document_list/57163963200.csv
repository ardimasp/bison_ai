This study investigated the differences in visitors' lifestyles that would potentially influence their selection of a holiday destination. The study used a set of activities, interests and opinion items to measure psychographic lifestyle typologies of foreign visitors who traveled to Jakarta. Factor analysis of the data identified six lifestyle factors, which were further analyzed using cluster analysis. The cluster analysis revealed four types of foreign visitors: culture interest shopaholic, sporty culture explorer, aspiring vacationer and want-everything vacationer. The four groups were compared through a chi-square test for independence analysis based on the types as well as the visitors' demographic profiles. Significant differences were found between the four groups in terms of age, race, employment status, number of previous trips to Jakarta, and travel companion. © 2016 The Authors.","Activities; Cluster analysis; Interests and opinion (AIO); Psychographic lifestyle; Tourism segmentation",,,,,,"Beh, A., Bruyere, B.L., Segmentation by visitor motivation in three Kenyan national reserves (2007) Tourism Management, 28, pp. 1464-1471; Blackwell, R.D., Miniard, P.W., Engel, J.F., (2006) Consumer behavior, , Thomson South-Western, Ohio; Buhalis, D., Marketing the competitive destination of the future (2000) Tourism Management, 21 (1), pp. 97-116; Chan, F., http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/jakarta-sets-aside-135m-to-triple-tourist-arrivals, 2015, October 13 Jakarta sets aside $135m to triple tourist arrivals.

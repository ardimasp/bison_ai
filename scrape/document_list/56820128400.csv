Method: Primary data for the study was collected through questionnaires as part of the survey research strategy applied. Linear regression was used to signify interactions between experiential marketing, customer loyalty, and customer satisfaction. Furthermore, One-Way ANOVA was also applied in order to indicate differences of the variables between the respondents’ perceptions of the three premium supermarkets. Results: In the Jakarta premium supermarket context, experiential marketing showed a direct and linear effect on customer satisfaction. However, experiential marketing showed an insignificant relationship with customer satisfaction when it was moderated by customer loyalty. Furthermore, based on the comparison test findings, there was a significant difference of experiential marketing factors as perceived by the respondents, while there is none for customer loyalty and customer satisfaction. Conclusion: the study signifies, in the Jakarta’s premium supermarkets context, that experiential marketing has a significant impact on these retailers. However, people in Jakarta did not exhibit particular loyalty to the premium supermarkets they frequented. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

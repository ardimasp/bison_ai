Raw milk also provides almost ideal media for various microorganisms to grow rapidly that can harm human digestion, or make damages the milk itself. In attempt to investigate an appropriate processing technology as an alternative of thermal pasteurization, we developed non thermal corona discharge to eliminate total number of various microorganisms in milk. The generated corona discharge used 7 pins to plate surface configuration. With a distance 15 mm between the electrodes, the applied voltage of 6.48 kV by a homemade high voltage AC power supply yields in corona discharge that has temperature lower than 30°C after 8 minutes operation. The time dependent effects of the implementation of this discharge to raw milk were carried out at time interval 2, 4 and 8 minutes. It was found that there was three different types of bacteria colony morphology in the microorganism population of raw milk. The microorganism counts were decrease for 2 and 4 min corona treatments. However, when the corona treatment was done in 8 min, the total number of microorganism increased significantly. Although the corona discharge shows the potential benefits in milk decontamination processing at low temperature, more detailed study should be carried out to confirm the suitable in real application including the nutrient composition before and after treatment. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","corona discharge; microorganism population; Non-thermal plasma; raw milk","Electric corona; Microorganisms; Morphology; Nutrients; Temperature; Bacteria colonies; Corona discharges; Nonthermal plasma; Nutrient composition; Potential benefits; Processing technologies; Raw milk; Time-dependent effects; Electric discharges",,,,"12/AKM/PNT/2019, 225/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019, 039/VR","The authors would like to acknowledge Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia for the financial support, according to contract number: 225/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019, 12/AKM/PNT/2019, 039/VR.RTT/IV/2019.","Eniza, S., Dasar pengolahan susu dan hasil ikutan ternak (2004) USU Digital Library, pp. 1-31; Muchamad Saiful, R., Enny, S., Suprihana, The effect of time and temperature sterilization on the cow milk chocolate flavour (2016) Jurnal Ilmu-ilmu Pertanian ""agrika"", 10, pp. 20-30; Ilbilge, S., Eren, N., Ali, T., Proteolysis and storage stability of UHT milk produced in Turkey (2006) International Dairy Journal, 16 (6), pp. 633-638; Harley, J., Hilton, D., (2007) Scientific Evaluation of Pasteurisation for Pathogen Pasteurisation for Pathogen Products; Novita Dewi, K., The effect of pasteurization milk storage to quality Microbe Thermoduric and chemical properties (2017) Jurnal Ilmu Dan Teknologi Hasil Ternak, 12 (1), pp. 1-7; Tri Yuni, H., Suratmin, U., Optimasi suhu dan waktu sterilisasi pada kualitas susu segar di kabupaten Boyolali (2017) Jurnal Teknologi, 9 (2), pp. 97-101; Tuhu Agung, R., Hanry Sutan, W., Pengolahan air limbah industri tahu dengan menggunakan teknologi plasma (2011) Jurnal Ilmu Teknik Lingkungan, 2, pp. 19-28; Muhammad, N., (2011) Fisika Plasma Dan Aplikasinya; Gurol, C., Ekinci, F.Y., Aslan, N., Korachi, M., Low Temperature Plasma for decontamination of E.

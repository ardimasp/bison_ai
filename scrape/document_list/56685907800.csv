Data collection from 360 motorcyclists, as survey respondent, in Jakarta, utilized purposive-sampling technique, with four instruments which reliabilities were calculated using Cronbach's Alpha. The goodness of fit and the validity of the Hypothetical model were tested through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), using Linear Structural Relation (LISREL) software version 8.72. As hypothesized, the improvement of job security could increase job satisfaction as well as perceived safety significantly, with the possibility of receiving an error less than 1%. Furthermore, the improvement of perceived safety could improve driving behavior significantly, while the improvement of job satisfaction was proven could decrease good driving behavior, also with the possibility of receiving an error less than 1%. Theoretical and practical implications for future directions are discussed. © 2015 IEEE.","collective culture; conservation of resources; driving behavior; job satisfaction; job security; perceived safety; stress","Conservation; Mobile security; Motorcycles; Safety engineering; Software testing; Stresses; Surveys; Conservation of resources; Driving behavior; Hypothetical models; Implications for futures; Job security; Sampling technique; Software versions; Structural equation modeling; Job satisfaction",,,,,"Freivalds, A., Niebel, B.W., (2014) Niebel's Methods, Standards, and Work Design, , (13th Ed.).

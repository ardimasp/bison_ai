Nevertheless, it is important to know organizations capability and project prioritization in delivering those projects so that the quantified value can be optimized. This paper aims to explore how the project portfolio management supports the project delivery capabilities through PMO to respond the environmental uncertainties and how it affects the bank performance that is measured using Return on Asset (ROA). Data were obtained from 74 respondents representing each of 74 commercial banks and analysed using the partial least squares structural equation modelling software SmartPLS 3.0. Study was concluded that project delivery capabilities had a significant impact on ROA in banks with larger equity category. This empirical research reveals that the environmental uncertainties are responded by the banks with bigger equity category (3 and 4) through implementing the right strategic initiatives in form of project that is managed with sufficient project delivery capabilities through PMO and significantly affecting the ROA. This phenomenon, however, is not reflected in Commercial Banks with smaller equity category (1 and 2). The result of this study shall provide insights to Indonesian Bank Regulatory to provide governance in managing strategic initiatives in the form of projects to the Indonesian Commercial Banks. © 2020 Universiti Putra Malaysia.

IoT is connecting physicals on the site with virtual things on the screen which enable the stakeholders to collaborate anywhere in real time. It used a qualitative method for coding, data visualization and finding a pattern to draw a conclusion with NVivo software. Data sources for the literature review consist of 26 journal articles about the Internet of Things in constructions project. They were published after the 4th industrial revolution in 2011. A structured interview was used as instrument data collection from four experts. Findings of the study show that the IoT platform can reduce rework, increased productivity, shorten project organization process, improve stakeholder collaboration, and use valid project document information of the project case study. These show how IoT Platform can increase the schedule performance.

This study examines the crucial role of project management office (PMO) practices in strategic initiative implementation, measured by the performance of banks taken from year 2014 to 2016. Empirical research was conducted through a survey, by using questionnaires to assess the contribution of PMO practices in managing strategic initiatives in Indonesian banks. A set of data from 74 top executives, representing 115 banks was collected. The variables for the strategic initiative implementation are project portfolio management capabilities, project management office practices, and performance of the banks reflected by their return on assets (ROA) analyzed and compared through Partial Least Square- Structural Equation Model method using SmartPLS 3.0 software. The results show that PMO practices have positively influenced the project portfolio management capabilities.

The aim of this research is to evaluate schedule performance improvement using the IoT platform and to propose a new Chief-Screen 1.0 model. The Value Engineering method combined with qualitative analysis using NVivo software is used. The research involved group interviews with 27 respondents from the construction industry, and interviews with four experts related to the project case study. The results of the IoT platform evaluation show that it improves schedule performance by 29.5%, by helping users to collect data and undertake information exchange with optimal processes, efficiency and improvement in validity. IoT platform users are more productive, as they have more time to identify problems and find solutions. The use of IoT can improve schedule performance from the weakness of fast-tracking acceleration and balanced matrix organization. Chief-screen 1.0 is a platform to omit digital technology disruption in the construction industry. © 2019 The Authors.","Balanced matrix organizational; Fast tracking; Industrial building project; Industrial revolution; Internet of things; Virtual project","Construction industry; Information systems; Information use; Office buildings; Value engineering; Balanced matrix organizational; Fast-Tracking; Industrial buildings; Industrial revolutions; Virtual projects; Internet of things",,,,,,"Agarwal, R., Chandrasekaran, S., Sridhar, M., (2016) The Digital Future of Construction, , McKinsey & Company; Kranz, M., (2017) Building the Internet of Things, , New Jersey, John Wiley & Sons; Armstrong, G., Gilge, C., (2016) Building A Technology Advantage, , KPMG International, Switzerland; (2012) ITU‐T Recommendation Y.2060, , note 6, s.I.1.2; Tauriainena, M., Marttinenc, P., Davea, B., Koskela, L., The effects of BIM and lean construction on design management practices (2016) Journal Procedia Engineering, 164, pp. 567-574; Xu, H., Feng, J., Li, S., Users-orientated Evaluation of Building Information Model in the Chinese Construction Industry (2014) Automation in Construction, 39, pp. 32-46; Lee, S.-K., Yu, J.-H., Success model of project management information system in construction (2012) Automation in Construction, 25, pp. 82-93; Woodhead, R., Stephenson, P., Morrey, D., Digital construction: From point solutions to IoT ecosystem (2018) Automation in Construction, 93, pp. 35-46; Svidt, K., Marin, A.M., Papaoikonomou, I., Nejad, R.H., (2017) Exploiting the Fusion between BIM and IoT, , Department of Civil Engineering, Aalborg University; (2017) A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide), , Project Management Institute, Inc; Martinelli, J., Russ, Milosevic, D.Z., (2016) Project Management Toolbox, Second Edition, , New Jersey, John Wiley & Sons; (1999) Function: Definition and Analysis, , SAVE International; Chi-Sung, N., Hyun, C., A study on the consecutiveness of the function analysis and idea creation phase with function integration (FI) and hierarchical value engineering concept modules (HVECM) (2009) Value World, 32 (1), pp. 16-27; Saldana, J., (2013) The Coding Manual for Qualitative Researchers, Second Edition, , London, SAGE; Sekaran, U., Bougie, R., (2016) Research Methods for Business, A Skill-Building Approach, Seventh Edition, , Chichester, John Wiley & Sons; (2015) 2015 Edition, Value Methodology Standard; Latief, Y., Berawi, M.A., Van Basten, R., Budiman, R., Construction performance optimization toward green building premium cost based on greenship rating tools assessment with value engineering method (2017) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 877. , IOP Publishing Ltd; Pilkington, A., (2013) Communicating Projects, An End-to-End Guide to Planning, Implementing and Evaluating Effective Communication, , Surrey, Gower Publishing Limited","Berawi, M.A.; Center for Sustainable Infrastructure Development, Indonesia; email: maberawi@eng.ui.ac.id","Younus A.",,"Elsevier B.V.","5th Information Systems International Conference, ISICO 2019","23 July 2019 through 24 July 2019",,156995,18770509,,,,"English","Procedia Comput.

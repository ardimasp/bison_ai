Many studies have been conducted to establish the characteristics of such news. This work intends to identify the characteristics that make the news convincing and inuential. To achieve the objective, we relate the fake news characteristics, identified from previous publications, to Klout score, a well-established indicator describing the impacts of news to their audience. A piece of news having a high Klout score is regarded to be inuential. For the current study, the data are collected from Twitter messages containing issues related to politics, business, and entertainment during the period of January-June 2017. A sample of 165 tweets is collected, and then, is identified for the fake news characteristics and Klout score. Finally, a logistic regression function is established relating the characteristics to the Klout score. The results suggest that the fake news characteristics of the use of fake photos/images and the absence of the publishing time are significant factors for the news to reach wider audience. © 2019, ICIC International.

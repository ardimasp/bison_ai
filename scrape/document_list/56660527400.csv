Prior research has documented that taxation issues may motivate a company to smooth its income. Furthermore, it has been well documented that corporate governance can avoid income smoothing practices. However, on the contrary, we did not find that the change of income tax rates in Indonesia and Singapore leads to income smoothing in both countries. Furthermore, we also conclude that only selected corporate governance mechanism serves as an effective barrier to income smoothing practices. We also found several contrary findings of corporate governance mechanism that may be caused by a big number of publicly listed family companies both in Indonesia and Singapore.

To overcome this issue, President Joko Widodo provides his direction and commitment to the development of human capital in Indonesia (World Economic Forum, 2015). This research examines whether Indonesian listed companies in the financial industry follows President’s direction to focus on human capital. The financial industry is used as a research sample due to its exemplary disclosure practices in Indonesia. Furthermore, this research employs the Indonesian intellectual capital disclosures framework developed by Mulyadi et al. (2017) to analyse IC disclosures in the industry. This framework consists of the working environment, intangible assets, and customer relations. Working environment largely consists of human capital, and this research reveals that working environment was the most disclosed IC category in Indonesian financial industry in 2015.

In response to the recent concern on the timeliness issue of annual reports, this research provides empirical evidence on IC disclosures among top Australian companies, using their Facebook pages. The similar focus of previous IC disclosures in the annual reports and the previous core focus of social media indicates that social media is viable alternative media for companies to disclose IC. Furthermore, Facebook has been the most popular social media among Australians and Australian businesses. This research is important in that it addresses IC disclosures from the social media perspective, an area of research in non-marketing disclosure study in social media which is under investigated. This research documents that Facebook has been used by ASX 200 high IC companies to disclose their IC information. Similar to previous research on IC disclosures research in annual reports, this research reveals that external capital is the most disclosed category on companies' Facebook pages and customers are the most disclosed IC sub-category. Further, this research also documents a two-way communication process on the companies' Facebook pages and shows that the companies have responded and communicated well with their stakeholders.

Despite the importance of intellectual capital, several researchers emphasise the limitation of such studies in non-developed countries. Furthermore, the majority of prior studies on intellectual capital disclosures employ content analysis despite its weaknesses. Therefore, this research constructed an Indonesian intellectual capital disclosure framework, a framework based on data of Indonesia that may overcome content analysis weaknesses. Furthermore, this research also offers a new joint theoretical framework, intellectual capital theoretical framework, which may be useful for future intellectual capital disclosure research. This research contributes to limited intellectual capital disclosure research in Indonesia and provides valuable insights into the practice in Indonesia. This research also contributes to the development and introduction of intellectual capital theoretical framework and Indonesian intellectual capital disclosure framework.

In order to support the development of this industry, it is a common practice that government provide tax incentives. While major prior research in tax incentives focus on the impact of tax incentives on economic development, this research focuses on the impact on corporate performance. This research studies digital TV tax incentives in Canada, Indonesia, and the United States of America (USA). Using EGARCH econometric model on the largest digital TV corporations in these three countries, this research finds that tax incentives are beneficial to support corporate performance with some exception.

As for Asia, especially South East Asia, the trigger was the 1997 economic crisis. The crisis showed the importance of good corporate governance implementation. It is understandable that every country has different policies and regulations; therefore, will lead to different implementation of good corporate governance. In this chapter, we will focus on the implementation of good corporate governance in selected South-East Asia banking industry (Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore selected listed-banking firms). We will analyse the implementation in three countries based on corporate governance rules and practices, enforcement, political and regulatory environment, IGAAP (accounting and auditing) and corporate governance culture. From five factors, we found that Singapore is the best country in the implementation of good corporate governance in its banking industry followed by Malaysia and Indonesia. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

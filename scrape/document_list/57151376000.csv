This treatment exhibited beneficial impacts of modified flour on resistant starch formation by 14.35%. Significant difference was exhibited between native and modified flour for ΔE value. Rapid visco analyzer was also used to determine pasting properties including peak viscocity, trough viscocity, breakdown, final viscosity, setback, and peak time where all of them except breakdown value were higher than the native one. Moreover, no signs of damage on the surface of native purple sweet potato flour were showed in micrograph of scanning electron microscopy. While autoclaving-cooling sample exhibited a rough structure as a result of the loss of its granular appearance and destroyed shape. This study also indicated a change of X-ray diffraction pattern from C-type to B-type caused by the modification treatment. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In this cross-sectional study, we compared the dietary patterns and food consumption of 103 obese and 104 normal-weight women of reproductive age (19–49 years) in urban slum areas in Central Jakarta. A single 24-h food recall was used to assess energy and macronutrient intakes (carbohydrate, protein and fat) and calculate energy density. A principal component analysis was used to define the dietary patterns from the FFQ. Obese women had significantly higher intakes of energy (8436·6 (SD 2358·1) v. 7504·4 (SD 1887·8) kJ (2016·4 (SD 563·6) v. 1793·6 (SD 451·2) kcal)), carbohydrate (263·9 (SD 77·0) v. 237·6 (SD 63·0) g) and fat (83·11 (SD 31·3) v. 70·2 (SD 26·1) g) compared with normal-weight women; however, their protein intake (59·4 (SD 19·1) v. 55·9 (SD 18·5) g) and energy density (8·911 (SD 2·30) v. 8·58 (SD 1·88) kJ/g (2·13 (SD 0·55) v. 2·05 (SD 0·45) kcal/g)) did not differ significantly. Two dietary patterns were revealed and subjectively named ‘more healthy’ and ‘less healthy’. The ‘less healthy’ pattern was characterised by the consumption of fried foods (snacks, soyabean and roots and tubers) and meat and poultry products, whereas the more healthy pattern was characterised by the consumption of seafood, vegetables, eggs, milk and milk products and non-fried snacks. Subjects with a high score for the more healthy pattern had a lower obesity risk compared with those with a low score. Thus, obesity is associated with high energy intake and unhealthy dietary patterns characterised by consumption of oils and fats through fried foods and snacks. © The Authors 2016","Dietary patterns; Energy density; Food intake; Intake; Obesity","adult; classification; diet; female; food; human; Indonesia; medical record; middle aged; obesity; poverty; urban population; young adult; Adult; Diet Records; Diet Surveys; Female; Food; Humans; Indonesia; Middle Aged; Obesity; Poverty Areas; Urban Population; Young Adult",,,,,,"(2000) Obesity: Preventing and Managing the Global Epidemic, , World Health Organization Report of a WHO Consultation, WHO Technical Series, 894.

In general, the number could be dichotomized into two categories: camp-based refugees and urban refugees. There are approximately 70.83% of urban refugees living in several cities across the country. The existence of refugees in urban environments has been considered as either bringing promise or peril to urban development. Makassar is one among the most populated cities by refugees in Indonesia. In the middle of the inadequacy of legal framework at the national level, the Makassar City Government initiated a policy to address the issues of refugees staying in the city specifically. In 2005, the Mayor of Makassar signed a Memorandum of Understanding with International Organization for Migration (IOM) to accommodate the needs for funding allocated from Regional Budget that could not be dispensed due to the absence of legal basis. The city also constituted a Joint Committee Monitoring (JCM), which comprises of various government agencies, to support the Immigration Office in monitoring the refugees. These initiatives allow refugees to access basic services that are not made available to them in other cities. Against this backdrop, this paper mainly discusses the initiatives and refugee policy of Makassar City Government, which had emulated the national government's policy to refugee management before the recently signed Presidential Decree No. 25 / 2016. It argues that the proactive and relatively integrative approach of the City Government alongside the social inclusion by the local community have contributed positively to the livelihoods of urban refugees in Makassar. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","city government; Makassar; migration; refugee management; urban refugees","Budget control; Urban growth; city government; Government agencies; International organizations; Makassar; Memorandum of understanding; migration; National governments; urban refugees; Public policy",,,,"Binus University","The authors gratefully acknowledge that the present research is supported by Bina Nusantara University.

Literature reviews of previously completed research studied existing frameworks and models, including the Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics (MDA) Framework and the Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation (ADDIE) Model, as well as the First Principles of Learning for designing the content of the game. The result shows the implementation of these frameworks in the design process of the game, as well as the early development of the game presented as a prototype. © 2016 IEEE.","digital game-based learning; game-based learning; international relations; strategic studies; video games)","Bins; Computer games; Curricula; Design; Education; Human computer interaction; Digital game-based learning; Game-based Learning; International relations; Strategic study; Video game; E-learning",,,,,,"Van Eck, R., Digital game-based learning: It's not just the digital natives who are restless (2006) Educause Review, , March/April; Asal, V., Playing games with International Relations (2005) International Studies Perspectives, pp. 359-373. , June; Bridge, D., Teaching diplomacy by other means: Using an outside-ofclass simulation to teach International Relations theory (2013) International Studies Perspectives, pp. 1-15; Hatipoglu, E., Muftuler-Bac, M., Murphy, T., Simulation games in teaching International Relations: Insights from a multi-day, multi-stage, multi-issue simulation on Cyprus (2013) International Studies Perspectives, pp. 1-13; Sabin, P., (2012) Simulating War: Studying Conflict Through Simulation Games, , New York: Continuum International Publishing Group; Climate Challenge, , http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/hottopics/climatechange/climate_challenge/, [Accessed 19 October 2016]; Museum, N.A., The Battle of Waterloo Game, , http://waterloo200.org/battle-of-waterloo-game/, [Accessed 19 October 2016]; Southeast Asia Games Market the World's Fastest Growing Region CASUAL GAMES SECTOR REPORT 2015, , Newzoo Games Market Research; Elkus, A., Professor, Tear Down This Wall: Is the Divide between Security Studies and Strategic Studies Permanent?

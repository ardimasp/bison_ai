However, to improve users' motivation, learning tool must be appealing. Researches have introduced the concept of gamification to make learning more entertaining. The primary purpose of this research is to understand how the proposed gamification elements using Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics (MDA) framework improve users' motivation and learning outcomes in English learning. For this research, we use six to eleven framework defining six aspects of emotion and eleven aspects of instinct. We collected users' scores then analyzed them by using a t-test. We also used a questionnaire to access the users' experience. The results suggest that most of the respondents are motivated to learn more deeply. We conclude that the proposed gamification elements improve users' motivation and learning outcomes. © 2019 IEEE.","6-11 Framework; English Language; Game; Game-based learning; MDA Framework","Motivation; 6-11 Framework; English languages; Game; Game-based Learning; MDA Framework; Data communication systems",,,,,"Deterding, S., Dixon, D., Khaled, R., Nacke, L.E., Gamification toward a definition (2011) Proceedings Ofthe 2011 Annual Conf Erence on Human Factors in Computing System; Johnson, L., Adams Becker, S., Estrada, V., Freeman, A., (2014) NMC Horizon Report: 2014 Higher Education Edition, , Texas: The New Media Consortium; Kim, S., Song, K., Lockee, B., Burton, J., (2017) Gamification in Learn Ing and Education: Enjoy Learning like Gaming, , Switzerland: Springer; Kapp, K.M., (2013) The Gamification OfLearning and Instruction Fieldbook: Ideas into Practice, , San Francisco: John Wiley & Sons; Pickard, T., (2017) 5 Statistics That Prove Gamification Is the Future Ofthe Workplace, , https://www.business.com!articles/5-statistics-that-prove-gamification-is-the-future-of-theworkplace/; Adams, E., (2010) Fundamentals of Game Design, , (2nd ed.), California: Pearson Education, Inc; Gilbert, S., (2016) Designing Gamified Systems, , Oxon: Focal Press; Zichermann Dan, G., Cunningham, C., (2011) Gamification by Design, , Sebastopol: O'Reilly; Hunicke, R., LeBlanc, M., Dan Zubek, R.M., (2004) MDA: A Formal Approach to Game Design and Game Research; Dillon, R., The 6-11 Framework: A new methodology for game analysis and design (2011) Proceedings Game-On Asia Conference, pp. 25-29; Su Dan, C.-H., Cheng, C.-H., A mobile gamification learning system for improving the learning motivation and achievements (2015) Journal Oj Computer Assisted Learning., pp. 268-286; Sari, B.W., Utami, E., Fatta, H.A., Penerapan konsep gamification pada pembelajaran tenses bahasa inggris berbasis web (2015) Jurnal Ilmiah SISFOTENIKA., 5, pp. 155-166; Lam, S.L., (2014) Use of Gamification in Vocabulary Learning: A Case Study in Macau; Garland, C.M., (2015) Gamification and Implications for Second Language Education: A Meta Analysis; Nedeva, V., Dimova, E., (2010) Some Advantages of C-Leaming in English Language Training; Faya Cerqueiro, F., Chao Castro, M., (2015) Board-games As Review Lessons in English Language Teaching: Useful Resources for Any Level; Ketyi, A., (2016) From Mobile Language Learning to Gamification: An Overlook of Research Results with Business Management Students over A Five-Year Period; Strmecki, D., Bernik, A., Radosevic, D., (2016) Gamific Ation in E-Learning: Introducing Gamified Design Elements into E-Learning Systems; Grina Myhre, M., (2015) Gamification in Mobile Language Learning: Improving User Satisfaction for Norwegian Immigrants; Gafui, R., Biran Achituv, D., Joyce Rachmani, G., (2017) Learning Foreign Languages Using Mobile Applications; Cheong, C., Cheong, F., Filippou, J., (2013) Quick Quiz: A Gamified Approa Ch Fo R Enchancing Learning; Osipov, L.V., Volinsky, A.A., Nikulchev, E., Prasikova, A.Y., (2015) Study of Gamification Effectiveness in Online E-Learning Systems",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","12th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology and Systems, ICTS 2019","18 July 2019",,152286,,9781728121338,,,"English","Proc.

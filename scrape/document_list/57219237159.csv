The modification of FPPD and LSB Substitution is located at the pixel block that is going to be used to insert the secret message. The pixel block being used is 2x2. The LSB Substitution method is a method to insert the data by changing the last bit of the pixel into the byte of the hidden message. FPPD uses data blocks and calculates the capacity of each blocks, then inserts the hidden message in accordance to the capacity of each blocks. The development of this method is expected to increase the capacity of the plain text without reducing the quality of the data produced. To help users in hiding and sending data, a steganoskrip application using improved PFFD and LSB Substitution method will be developed on Android smartphone. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

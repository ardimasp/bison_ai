The research method implemented in this study is analysis of clash detection using building information modeling (BIM) software for structural, architectural, and MEP of mid-rise building in Jakarta. The result of this thesis is BIM-based 3D construction modelling, the analysis of clash detection which detected namely 104 clashes within overall models, and the estimate analysis of change in construction cost due to clash resolves with result of nearly 1% change of cost and quantity within structural, and MEP model. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","BIM; clash; construction; detection; midrise","3D modeling; Construction; Cost benefit analysis; Error detection; 3D construction; BIM technologies; Building Information Model - BIM; clash; Construction costs; midrise; Midrise buildings; research methods; Architectural design",,,,,"Rizal Sebastian, W.H.E.V., BIM Application for Integrated Design and Engineering in Small (2009) Research Gate; Bhamre Guarav Shyamkant, A.P.S.P., Cost and Time Optimization for Construction of Residential Building by Clash Detection in Building Information Model (BIM) (2017) International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET); Arumsari, P., Juliastuti, Al'Farisi, M., Cost estimation using ministerial regulation of public work no. 11/2013 in construction projects. the International Conference on Eco Engineering Development 2017 (ICEED 2017) (2018) IOP Conf.

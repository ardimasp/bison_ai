However, if risks are left uncontrolled and not treated soon, they will create systemic risks that can create substantial costs. For this reason, early detection needs to be done in the context of prevention before a crisis occurs. This study aims to determine the level vulnerability of banking industry to the shocks and the bank's resilience profile to shocks in the midst of FinTech developments. The analytical method used in this study is logit regression, which starts with calculating indexation to measure the level of bank vulnerability to shocks. The data used in this study includes banks financial statements and macroeconomic data. The results showed that exchange rate pressures and Non-Performing Loans had the largest contribution as the cause of bank vulnerability with a probability value of 2.363% and 2.006%. Bank Rakyat Indonesia Syariah is the most unstable and most vulnerable bank to the shocks during the 2016-2018 period. © 2020 IEEE.","Early warning system; Insert; Systemic risk","Economics; Fintech; Information management; Logistic regression; Analytical method; Banking industry; Early detection system; Exchange rates; Financial statements; Global economies; Indonesia; Systemic risks; Banking",,,,,"We thank to all parties such as the RTTO, Knowledge Management Team Bina Nusantara University who have funded this research, reviewers who have given the opportunity and provide input to improve this article and all those who have supported the completion of this article.","Casu, (2016) Introduction to Banking, , Harlow, England: Prentice HillG; (2015) Bank Indonesia Regulation Number 17/11/PBI/2015 concerning Amendments to Bank Indonesia Regulation Number 15/15/PBI/2013 concerning Statutory Reserves for Commercial Banks in Rupiahs and Foreign Currencies for Conventional Commercial Banks.

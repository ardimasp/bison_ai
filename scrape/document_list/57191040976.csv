Studies have shown that most youngsters suffer nomophobia to a certain degree ranging from mild to severe. In Indonesia, all studied participants are nomophobic with 71.42% suffer moderate nomophobia, 19.04% severe and 9.52% mild. Through the psychosemiotic study of nomophobia in the ad, it is concluded that beyond the surface denotative meaning that the ad is designed to simultaneously invite consumers to buy it and legitimize the disappearance of nomophobia, the deeper ideological meaning has surfaced: people have been psychologically attached too much to the very technology than to other human beings and God, signifying all are powerless in the face of technology. © 2017 IEEE.","Mophie; Nomophobia; Psychosemiotics; Smartphone","Human computer interaction; Human being; Indonesia; Mophie; Nomophobia; Psychological attachment; Psychosemiotics; Smartphones",,,,,"Akun, A., Unfortunately funny - laughing out loud at life misfortunes: Signifying dark humors in Jakarta street motorcycles stickers The Asian Conference on Cultural Studies Conference Proceedings 2012, pp. 1-10; Darcin, A.E., Kose, S., Noyan, C.O., Nurmedov, S., Yilmaz, O., Dilbaz, N., Smartphone addiction and its relationship with social anxiety and loneliness (2016) Behaviour & Information Technology, 35 (7), pp. 1-6; Mareza, B., (2016) Galau Tanpa Ponsel Hati-hati Gejala Nomophobia, , CNN Indonesia; Wellman, B., Rainie, L., If romeo and juliet had mobile phones (2013) Mobile Media & Communication, 1 (1), pp. 166-171; Yildirim, C., Sumuer, E., Agnan, M., Yildirim, S., A growing fear: Prevalence of nomophobia among Turkish college students (2015) Information Development, pp. 1-10; Maier, C.T., Deluliis, D., Recovering the human in the network: Exploring communicology as a research methodology in digital business discourse (2015) Digital Business Discourse, , (ed.

However, the real implementation of the slogan is still beyond expectation. The goals of this research are to trail university students’ attitude toward diversity based on their conceptual understanding of the national slogan, their daily exposure toward diversity, and to critically analyze their ambiguous attitudes toward diversity. The research was conducted in 10 universities all over Indonesia with 267 respondents from English Department students. The respondents were asked to write an instant poem on free diversity experience and answer a questionnaire distributed afterward. The result of the study has shown that despite the fact that most of the students have positive attitude toward diversity in their poem, with almost perfect conceptual understanding of the national slogan, most of them still have ambiguous attitude in a deeper level of their claim upon individual declaration as a (non)pluralist. It is suggested that restoration and transformation of perception on diversity through education, new acceptance of hybridity and redefined identity, by reimagining diversity as empowering, is essentially needed to change Indonesian diversity reality into unity and prosperity. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Ambiguity; Attitude; Diversity; Poem; University student",,,,,,"Akun, A., Andreani, W., (2015) Microaggression and Diversity, , Tracing Indonesian University Students’ Attitudes toward Pluralism through Metaphorical Creative Expressions, Unpublished paper; Anhaf, M.I., (2013) Contesting Morality: Youth Piety and Pluralism in Indonesia, , The Pluralism Knowledge Programme, Utrecht; Brett, R.L., Jones, A.R., (2005) Lyrical Ballads: Wordsworth and Coleridge, , Routledge, New York; Dieleman, M., Koning, J., Post, P., (2011) Chinese Indonesians and Regime Change, , Brill, Leiden; Drury, J., (2006), The Poetry Dictionary, Writer’s Digest Book, Ohio; Heryanto, A., (2014) Identity and Pleasure: The Politics of Indonesian Screen Culture, , NU Press, Singapore; Kenndy, X.J., Gioia, D., (2005) Literature: An Introduction to Fiction Poetry Drama, , Pearson-Longman, New York; Koning, J., (2007) East Asia, 24, p. 129; Mariani, N., Syamsyiatun, S., Banawiratma, J.B., (2013) IJIMS: Indonesian Journal of Islam and Muslim Societies, 3, p. 1; Fainsilber, L., Ortony, A., (1987) Metaphor and Symbolic Activity, 2, p. 239; Parvis, L., (2013) Understanding Cultural Diversity in Today’s Complex World, , Embrace Publications and Consulting, LLC, Minneapolis","Akun, A.; English Department, Indonesia",,,"American Scientific Publishers",,,,,19366612,,,,"English","Adv.

Film, such as The Trouble House by Emil Heradi has also been chosen as a medium to promote the fight against corruption. By employing Pierre Macherey’s concept of the Spoken and the Unspoken, this study has revealed that despite its spoken ideology that corruption can be fought by the help of women characters through their role in assisting their potential and high positioned husband, women on the other hand are unconsciously represented as a source of dilemma, objectified, degraded as domesticated housewife or bitchy mistress, all as the very reason for men’s corruption. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

The degradation is not to be prevented as it happens as a side effect of technology. However, balancing usage of mobile device and quality of face-to-face communication is possible. By approaching users through developing a party genre mobile game with local multiplayer focus and introducing the given game to users, it is expected that face-to-face communication can be encouraged, thus resulting in mobile party game to become a media for the encouragement. A mini game that is a part of party game is developed with the help of Unity game engine as a testing object in which user response is collected. In the testing phase, target user response is collected, face-to-face encouragement is proven and user response is positive towards the game. Sample game testing has effectively re-introduced the existence of nowadays rare party game in mobile platform along with encouraging face-to-face communication, shown by the enthusiasm and enjoyment that audience testers have experienced. To conclude, mobile party games can help by being a media to encourage face-to-face communication and prevent degradation of such communication, future developments of a complete party game in mobile platform is highly encouraged as overall face-to-face communication quality enhancement may be required in the future in order to mitigate degradation. © 2016 IEEE.","Face-to-face Communication; Games; Local Network Unity; Mini Game; Mobile Device; Multiplayer; Party Genre; Racing","Mobile phones; Face-to-face communications; Games; Local networks; Mini Game; Multiplayers; Party Genre; Racing; Mobile devices",,,,,"(2014) Gartner Says Worldwide Traditional PC Tablet Ultramobile and Mobile Phone Shipments on Pace to Grow 7.6 Percent in 2014, , http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2645115, Retreived June 12, 2014, from; (2014), http://148apps.biz/app-store-metrics/?mpage=appcount, Retrieved April 24, 2014, from; Teens Prefer to Communicate Via Text -Study, , http://www.guidetoschools.ca/blog/Calgary-Schools-Teachers-Parents-Teens-Prefer-to-Communicate-Via-Texting-Study, n.d.).

Industry 4.0 provides new opportunities to improve the resource and process efficiencies by combining information and communication technologies such as autonomous robots, internet of things, cloud computing, big data, augmented reality, additive manufacturing, etc. This integrated cyber-physical production system raise complexity within production system that implies new competencies required for industrial engineers which has been proven for years that the role of industrial engineer greatly influences a manufacturing industry's success by designing, implementing, improving and optimizing a complex processes of an integrated systems that consist of people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy and materials. The competencies required in Industry 4.0 could be categorized under technical competencies and social competencies. A learning factory with real world system is often used to train students a new set of competencies by hands-on and direct experiences. Therefore, a learning factory can make a substantial contribution to competencies enhancement for industrial engineering students. This paper presents a conceptual of Industry 4.0 Lab as a learning factory for industrial engineering education as an enabler of students' competencies in industry 4.0 era. A fully automated small production of filling bottle system integrating and demonstrating various Industry 4.0 concepts technologies is chosen. The learning modules and didactic approach are developed by integrating industrial engineering body of knowledge, Industry 4.0 value drives and Industry 4.0 levers in the creation of technical and social competencies required. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","competencies; industrial engineering; Industry 4.0; learning factory","Augmented reality; Bottles; Competition; Data communication equipment; Digital storage; Engineers; Industrial engineering; Industry 4.0; Students; competencies; Conceptual development; Global competition; Information and Communication Technologies; Integrated systems; Learning factory; Manufacturing industries; Technical competencies; Engineering education",,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF","Initially, the learning factory was developed by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in America in 1994.

To automate this particular judgment process, an algorithm that resembles human recognition ability is required. Sense Learning is our algorithm that mimics the human recognition ability using the images of non-defective products. With an autoencoder, a deep-learning-based network, the inspection AI progressively learns to reconstruct the images of non-defective products, thereby acknowledging the ideal characteristics of products. When the image of a defective product is input, the inspection AI fails to reconstruct the defective part because it has never learned the form. Based on the difference between the input image and the reconstructed image, Sense Learning detects the defective part and measures the degree of its severity. © 2018 Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd.

One of the supply chain activities is supplier selection. Supplier selection has involved in maintaining the smoothness of process production, the dependency between suppliers has becomes a serious concern for company. This study focuses on the supplier selection problem to obtain the best supplier for Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) Company. The criteria of supplier selections for (FMCG) company were introduced. The criteria in supplier evaluations are limited to quality, price, payment term, quantity accuracy, on time accuracy, response of supplier, flexibility of supplier and completeness of document. The weights of importance level for each criteria is processed by using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach. In obtaining information on supplier overall performance, the weights of importance level is multiplied with actual supplier score. As the result, the score of overall supplier performance could help decision maker in deciding the amount of allocation order that should be distributed for each supplier. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Analytic hierarchy process; Fast moving consumer goods (FCMG); Order allocation; Supplier selection; Supply chain management",,,,,,,"Galankashi, M.R., Helmi, S.A., Supplier selection in automobile industry: A mixed balanced scorecard-fuzzy AHP approach (2016) Alexandria Engineering Journal, 55 (1), pp. 93-100; Kilincci, O., Onal, S.A., Fuzzy AHP approach for supplier selection in a washing machine company (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 38 (8), pp. 9656-9664; Chang, B., Chang, C.-W., Fuzzy DEMATEL method for developing supplier selection criteria (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 38 (3), pp. 1850-1858; Mendoza, A., Ventura, J.A., Analytical models for supplier selection and order quantity allocation (2012) Applied Mathematical Modelling, 36 (8), pp. 3826-3836; Nazari-Shirkouhi, S., Shakouri, H., Supplier selection and order allocation problem using a two-phase fuzzy multi-objective programming (2012) Applied Mathematical Modelling, 37 (22), pp. 1-16; Firouz, M., Burchu, B., An integrated supplier selection and inventory problem with multi-sourcing and lateral transshipments (2016) The International Journal of Management Science, pp. 1-43; Singh, A., Supplier evaluation and demand allocation among suppliers (2014) Journal of Purchasing & Supply Management, 20 (3), pp. 6-9; Raoa, C., Xiao, X., Compound Mechanism Design of Supplier Selection Based on Multi-attribute Auction and Risk Management of Supply Chain (2016) Computers & Industria lEngineering, 105, pp. 1-31; Sodenkamp, M.A., Tavana, M., Modeling synergies in multi-criteria supplier selection and order allocation: An application to commodity trading (2016) European Journal of Operational Research, 254 (3), pp. 1-16; Rezaei, J., Fahim, P.B.M., Supplier selection in the airline retail industry using a funnel methodology: Conjunctive screening method and fuzzy AHP (2014) Expert Systems with Applications, 48 (18), pp. 1-42; Luo, X., Wu, C., Supplier selection in agile supply chains: An information-processing model and a illustration (2009) Journal of Purchasing & Supply Management, 15 (4), pp. 249-262; Chaffey, D., (2009) E-Business and E-Commerce Management Strategy, Implementation and Practice, , Harlow: Prentice Hall; Sheth, J.N., Sharma, A., Why integrating purchasing with marketing is both inevitable and beneficial (2009) Industrial Marketing Management, 38 (8), pp. 865-871; Aissaoui, N., Haouari, M., Supplier selection and order lot sizing modeling: A review (2007) Computers and Operations Research, 34 (12), pp. 3516-3540. , (in press); Erdem, A.S., Gocen, E., Development of a decision support system for supplier evaluation and order allocation (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 39 (5), pp. 4927-4937; De Boer, L., Labro, E., A review of methods supporting supplier selection (2001) European Journal of Purchasing & Supply Management, 7 (2), pp. 75-89; Demirtas, E.A., Ustun, O., Analytic network process and multi-period goal programming integration in purchasing decisions (2009) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 56 (2), pp. 677-690; Tramarico, C.L., Analytic Hierarchy Process and Supply Chain Management: A Bibliometric Study, Information Technology and Quantitative Management (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 55, pp. 441-450. , Brazil; Chan, F.T.S., Kumar, N., Global supplier selection: a fuzzy-AHP approach (2008) International Journal of Production Research, 46 (14), pp. 3825-3857; Omkarprasad, S., Vaidya, S.K., Analytic hierarchy process: An overview of applications (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, (169), pp. 1-29; Sipahi, S., Timor, M., The analytic hierarchy process and analytic network process: an overview of applications (2010) Management Decision, 48 (5), pp. 775-808; Ishizaka, A., Nemery, P., (2013) Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis: methods and software, , John Wiley & Sons Ltd; Levary, R.R., Using the analytic hierarchy process to rank foreign suppliers based on supply risks (2008) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 55 (2), pp. 535-542; Ho, W., Xu, X., Multi-criteria decision making approaches for supplier evaluation and selection: A literature review (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 202 (1), pp. 16-24","Sahroni, T.R.; Master in Industrial Engineering, Jl.

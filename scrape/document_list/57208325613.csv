A social network paradigm and a human-computer interaction concept is used to predict the type of eWOM, whether as an in-group or out-of-group. The study used a cross-sectional quantitative survey to test the hypotheses. A convenient sampling method was used to recruit 158 respondents, aged between 18 and 25 years, who were social media users. Data was analysed using a regression analysis. Mood enhancement was found as a significant predictor for experiential learning and escapism. Escapism in turn was found to be a significant predictor for social interactions. Both experiential learning and social interactions were discovered to be significant predictors for all social media perceptions: openness, participation, connectedness, conversationality, and commonality. Only social media perceptions, openness, and connectedness were found to be significant predictors for eWOM, for in-group and out-of-group. Social media motivation drivers that promote learning and social interactions can be used to make social media users proactive in engaging with the brand. The underlying social media motivation drivers create social media perceptions that demand the need for social media to be creative, adaptable, and sociable. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Electronic word of mouth; In-group and out-of-group; Motivation drivers; Social media; Social network",,,,,,"Abrantes, J.L., Seabra, C., Lages, C.R., Jayawardhena, C., Drivers of in-group and out-of-group electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) (2013) European Journal of Marketing, 47 (7), pp. 1067-1088; Borgatti, S., Foster, P.C., The network paradigm in organizational research: A review and typology (2003) Journal of Management, 29 (6), pp. 991-1013. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0149-2063(03)00087-4; Chan-Olmsted, S.M., Cho, M., Lee, S., User perceptions of social media: A comparative study of perceived characteristics and user profiles by social media (2013) Online Journal of Communication and Media Technologies, 3 (4), pp. 149-178; Chu, S., Kim, Y., Determinants of consumer engagement in electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) in social networking sites (2011) International Journal of Advertising, 30 (1), pp. 47-75; Curras-Perez, R., Ruiz-Mafe, C., Sanz-Blas, S., Determinants of user behaviour and recommendation in social networks (2014) Industrial Management and Data System, 114 (9), pp. 1477-1498; Dholakia, U.M., Bagozzi, R.P., Pearo, L.K., A social influence model of consumer participation in network- And small-group-based virtual communities (2004) International Journal of Research in Marketing, 21, pp. 241-263; DiMaggio, P., Hargittai, E., Neuman, W., Robinson, J., Social implications of the internet (2001) Annual Review of Sociology, 27 (1), pp. 307-336. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307; Dix, A., Finlay, J.E., Abowd, G.D., Beale, R., (2005) Human-Computer Interaction, , New York: Pearson Education; Fischer, E., Reuber, R., Social interaction via new social media: (How) can interactions on twitter affect effectual thinking and behaviour?

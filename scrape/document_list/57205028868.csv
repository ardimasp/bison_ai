After the results of the measurement of each process obtained, it is discovered that the overall maturity level of the process is level 1. Specifically, the maturity level of each process is EDM02 (Level 0), APO09 (Levell), APO11 (Levell), BAI01 (Levell), BAI02 (Level 2), BAI03 (Level 2), BAI04 (Levell), BAI08 (Level 0) and MEA02 (Level 2). © 2018 IEEE.","COBIT 5; financing company; IT project management; project governance","Finance; Information management; Mapping; Public policy; Software design; COBIT 5; Good governances; It project managements; Latest technology; Maturity levels; Measurement indicators; Project governance; Project success; Project management",,,,,"Edward, B., Milen, I., It project management control and the control objectives for it and related technology (COBIT) framework (2013) International Journal of Project Management, 29 (3), pp. 325-336; Aryo Bayu, B., (2015) Perancangan Tata Kelola Pada Proyek Pengembangan Sistem Dengan Kerangka Kerja COBIT 5 : Studi Kasus PT Bank XYZ (Persero), , Tbk Depok : Universitas Indonesia; (2012), ISACA.

Sarcasm flips the polarity of a sentence and will affect the accuracy of sentiment analysis task. Recent researches incorporate machine learning and deep learning methods to detect sarcasm. Sarcasm can be detected by the occurrence of context disparity. This feature can be detected by observing the similarity score of each word in the sentence. Word embedding vector is used to calculate word similarity score. In this work, the word similarity score is incorporated as an augmented feature in the deep learning model. Three augmenting schemes in deep learning models are observed. Results show that in general, a word similarity score boosts the performance of the classifier. The accuracy of 85.625% with F-Measure of 84.884% was achieved at its best. © 2018 ACCENTS.","Augmented feature; Deep learning; Sarcasm detection; Word incongruity",,,,,,"https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sarcasm, Accessed 9 October 2018; Harris, Z.S., Distributional structure (1954) Word, 10 (2-3), pp. 146-162; Mikolov, T., Sutskever, I., Chen, K., Corrado, G.S., Dean, J., Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality (2013) In advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 3111-3119; Joshi, A., Sharma, V., Bhattacharyya, P., Harnessing context incongruity for sarcasm detection (2015) In proceedings of the 53rd annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics and the 7th international joint conference on natural language processing, pp. 757-762. , Association for Computational Linguistics; Poria, S., Cambria, E., Hazarika, D., Vij, P., A deeper look into sarcastic tweets using deep convolutional neural networks (2016) In proceedings of international conference on computational linguistics: technical papers, pp. 1601-1612. , The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee; Severyn, A., Moschitti, A., Twitter sentiment analysis with deep convolutional neural networks (2015) In proceedings of the international ACM SIGIR conference on research and development in information retrieval, pp. 959-962. , ACM; Majumder, N., Poria, S., Gelbukh, A., Cambria, E., Deep learning-based document modeling for personality detection from text (2017) IEEE Intelligent Systems, 32 (2), pp. 74-79; Lin, J., Scalable language processing algorithms for the masses: a case study in computing word co-occurrence matrices with MapReduce (2008) In proceedings of the conference on empirical methods in natural language processing, pp. 419-428. , Association for Computational Linguistics; Ivanko, S.L., Pexman, P.M., Context incongruity and irony processing (2003) Discourse Processes, 35 (3), pp. 241-279; Mikolov, T., Chen, K., Corrado, G., Dean, J., (2013) Efficient estimation of word representations in vector space, , arXiv preprint; Joshi, A., Tripathi, V., Patel, K., Bhattacharyya, P., Carman, M., (2016) Are word embedding-based features useful for sarcasm detection?, , arXiv preprint; Lunando, E., Purwarianti, A., Indonesian social media sentiment analysis with sarcasm detection (2013) In international conference on advanced computer science and information systems, pp. 195-198. , IEEE; Allcott, H., Gentzkow, M., Social media and fake news in the 2016 election (2017) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 31 (2), pp. 211-236; LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., Hinton, G., Deep learning (2015) Nature, 521 (7553), p. 436; Liu, B., Dixit, M., Kwitt, R., Vasconcelos, N., Feature space transfer for data augmentation (2018) In proceedings of the conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 9090-9098. , IEEE; Volpi, R., Morerio, P., Savarese, S., Murino, V., Adversarial feature augmentation for unsupervised domain adaptation (2018) In proceedings of the conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 5404-5495. , IEEE; Salamon, J., Bello, J.P., Deep convolutional neural networks and data augmentation for environmental sound classification (2017) IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 24 (3), pp. 279-283; Valkonen, M., Kartasalo, K., Liimatainen, K., Nykter, M., Latonen, L., Ruusuvuori, P., Dual structured convolutional neural network with feature augmentation for quantitative characterization of tissue histology (2017) In proceedings of the conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 27-35. , IEEE; Han, B., Baldwin, T., Lexical normalisation of short text messages: Makn sens a# twitter In proceedings of the annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics: human language technologies, pp. 368-378. , Association for Computational Linguistics; Tahitoe, A.D., Purwitasari, D., (2010) Implementasi modifikasi enhanced confix stripping stemmer untuk bahasa indonesia dengan metode corpus based stemming, , Institut Teknologi Sepuluh (ITS); Meyer, D., Hornik, K., Feinerer, I., Text mining infrastructure in R (2008) Journal of Statistical Software, 25 (5), pp. 1-54; Tala, F.Z., (2003) A study of stemming effects on information retrieval in bahasa Indonesia, , Institute for Logic, Language and Computation, Universiteit van Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Lu, Y., Sakamoto, K., Shibuki, H., Mori, T., Are deep learning methods better for twitter sentiment analysis?

It can be used for automatic parking gate or automatic ticketing system. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Genetic Algorithms (GA) in optimizing the number of hidden neurons, learning rate and momentum rate on Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) that is applied to the Automatic Plate Number Recognizer (APNR). Research done by building a GA optimized BPNN (GABPNN) and APNR system using image processing methods, including grayscale conversion, top-hat transformation, binary morphological, Otsu threshold and binary image projection. The tests conducted with backpropagation training and recognition test. The result shows that GA optimized backpropagation neural network requires 2230 epochs in the training process to be convergent, which is 36.83% faster than non-optimal backpropagation neural network, while the accuracy is 1,35% better than non-optimized backpropagation neural network. © 2017 The Authors.

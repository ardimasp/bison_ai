This research focuses on using the maximum power point tracking technique (MPPT), particularly the perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm, to charge battery for street light system. The proposed charger circuit can achieve 20.73% higher power efficiency compared to that of non-MPPT charger. We also develop the LED driver circuit for the system which can achieve power efficiency up to 91.9% at a current of 1.06 A. The proposed street lightning system can be implemented with a relatively low cost for public areas. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,"Dresselhaus, M.S., Thomas, I.L., Alternative energy technology (2001) Nature, 414, pp. 332-337. , Nov; Hartnett, J.P., (1976) Alternative Energy Source, , Academic Press, Inc., New York; (1993) Renewable Energy - Sources for Fuels and Electricity, , Island Press, Washington; Farret, F., Simoes, M., (2006) Integration of Alternative Sources of Energy, , Wiley-IEEE Press; Markvart, T., (2000) Solar Electricity, 2 Nd Edition, , John Wiley & Sons; Price, H., Kearney, D., Reducing the cost of energy from parabolic trough solar power plants (2003) International Solar Energy Conference (ISES 2003), pp. 1-9. , Hawaii; Ghaffari, A., Seshagiri, S., Krstic, M., Power optimization for photovoltaic micro-converters using multivariable gradient-based extremum-seeking (2012) American Control Conference, pp. 3383-3388; Gules, R., De Pellegrin, P.J., Hey, H.L., Imhoff, J., A maximum power point tracking system with parallel connection for PV stand-alone applications (2008) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 55 (7), pp. 2674-2683; McKinley, P.K., Trefftz, C., MultiSim: A simulation tool for the study of large-scale multiprocessors (1993) Proceedings of the 1993 International Workshop on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunications Networks (MASCOTS), pp. 57-62; Jiang, J.A., Liang Huang, T., Tung Hsiao, Y., Hong Chen, C., Maximum power tracking for photovoltaic power systems (2005) Tamkang Journal of Science and Engineering, 8 (2), pp. 147-153; Yeop, K.T., Gyun, A.H., Seungkyu, P., Younkyu, L., A novel maximum power point tracking control for photovoltaic power system under rapidly changing solar radiation (2001) Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics, 2, pp. 1011-1014; Ying Tung, T.H., China Hong, C., Maximum power tracking for photovoltaic power system (2002) 37th IAS Annual Meeting.

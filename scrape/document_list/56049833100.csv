The steganography technique on audio generally only make use of the main body of the audio file, but has not ever use the part of the ID3v2 to hide an message. This study an steganography technique which make use of this ID3v2 tag space where message is encrypted using McEliece cryptosystem method which applying the public key in the form of matrix then inserted into the MP3 file applying Before All Frames (BAF) method, whereas the public key is inserted into album cover figure which is stored in the ID3v2 tag. © 2014 Science Publications.","Before all frames; ID3v2 tag; McEliece cryptosystem; MP3",,,,,,"Anitha, P.T., Rajaram, M., Sivanandham, S.N., A hybrid approach for detecting stego content in corporate mail using neural network based simplified-data encryption standard algorithm (2012) Am.

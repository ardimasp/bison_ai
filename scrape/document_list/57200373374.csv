These facilities certainly take space and a great cost. One architecture concept that can be used as a solution to these problems is Portable Architecture. Portable Architecture is expected to be a solution in land use efficiency to support sustainable architecture. Portable Architecture is an architectural object that can move or be moved and can adapt to changes in the environment. Portable Architecture in a video recording studio must be able to anticipate any changes in the space around its environment. Portable video recording studio can be reused in different places. Then Portable video recording studio devices must be able to reduce sound well, easily disassembled, having a good ventilation system, fit one person, and having video recording devices (backdrop, lighting, tripods, cameras, audio). © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","portable architecture; studio recording; sustainable architecture","Audio acoustics; Land use; Studios; Sustainable development; Ventilation; Video recording; Architecture studios; Land use efficiency; Learning technology; Recording devices; Space limitations; Studio recordings; Sustainable architecture; Ventilation systems; Architecture",,,,,"Yousef, A.M.F., (2015) The State of Video-Based Learning: A Review and Future Perspectives; Kronenburg, R., (2013) Portable Architecture; Shalahuddin, A.A., (2008) Portable Architecture: Its Existance Within Space and Time; Oliver, P., (1997) Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World; Echavarria, P., (2005) Portable Architecture and Unpredictable Surroundings; Kronenburg, R., (2002) Houses in Motion: The Genesis, History and Development of Portable Building; Basner, Z., (2018) Set Up A Killer Office Video Studio on A Beginner Budget.

This is a human trait inherited from generation to generation. Where we can feel happy, interested or amazed by the beauty of nature. The rapid development and technological advances make our relationship with nature farther away. As a result, we become indifferent to the environment around us, the degeneration of ecosystems, and cause mental disorders and stress. Stress and stress disorders are problems that are often experienced by office workers in big cities like Jakarta. There are 60.8% of office workers experiencing depression and stress. One factor causing stress is the work environment, which is a dense urban area. Therefore, rebuilding our relationship with nature becomes more important in the field of conservation. The concept of biophilic design is a design approach based on biophilia aspects which aims to produce coworking spaces that can reduce stress and provide mental and physical healing to its users. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Biophilic design; coworking space; sustainable architecture","Architecture; Office buildings; Sustainable development; coworking space; Dense urban areas; Design approaches; Mental disorders; Stress disorders; Sustainable architecture; Technological advances; Work environments; Occupational risks",,,,,"Amjad, A., Asaad, A., Abdushaik, Z.K., Khalil, S., Biophilic architecture, the concept of healthy sustainable architecture (2006) PLEA2006-23rd International Conference on Passive and Low Energy Architecture, Conference Proceedings, pp. 1383-1386; Browning, W., Ryan, C., Clancy, J., (2014) Fourteen Patterns of Biophilic Design; Ana, H., Biophilic Design, Restorative Environments and Well-Being (2014) 9th International Conference on Design and Emotion 2014: The Colors of Care; Kellert, S., Heerwagen, J., Mador, M., (2008) Biophilic Design: The Theory, Science, and Practice of Bringing Buildings to Life; Ryan Catherine, O., BIOPHILIC DESIGN PATTERNS: Emerging Nature-Based Parameters for Health and Well-Being in the Built Environment (2014) International Journal of Architectural Research: ArchNet-IJAR, [S.l.], 8, pp. 62-76; Wilson, E.O., (1984) Biophilia: The Human Bond with Other Species","Suharjanto, G.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: gatotsuharjanto@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The background of this study is that the implementation of sustainable architecture in design should not have negative consequences for future generations. Awareness of energy conservation by avoiding depletion of resources including energy and water, preventing environmental degradation and creating a comfortable, safe and liveable environment that needs to be considered. The water management is essential for any country in the world, but the unconsciousness in the concept of rainwater management systems makes people not interested in adopting this system. So, promoting the rainwater harvesting system and utilization that system as sustainable rainwater management becomes an important issue and it must be remembered that every drop of the water must be stored and used for mankind. The collection of rainwater in this study is focused on a roof as a catchment areaand to accommodate these objectives, a brief calculation of the roof area is 64m2and the result showed that it can be provide and full fill 100% of the water needs for the latrines flushing and cleaning the house for 19 months. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Through this analysis, the development of an area can be intervened in a planned manner. Morphology can be a valuable tool by linking technological aspects to urban sustainability strategies with various aspects of culture, social, civil through urban architectural design. This tool can be used in accordance with comprehensive and complex sustainability ideas that can only be achieved fully through the renewal of public awareness and the use of available resources. Architecture and language (linguistics) have a basic resemblance, where both are tools for conveying messages, radiating impressions and as objects to capture impressions and messages. Likewise, in understanding the form, both have the same similarity. The form of the two fields of science is studied in morphology. Morphology of the city learn the intricacies of urban space form and function changes the shape of urban space, both functions of grammatical and semantic functions. The smallest element of linguistics is morpheme, the smallest element of architecture urban is the space, so morpheme can be analogical into the space (morpheme = space).

If the permeability increases the travel distance decreases and the route of travel choice increases, permeability like this can create an easy access system and physically integrated. This study aims to identify the relationship of physical characteristics of residential area and road network pattern to the level of space permeability in Bojonggede area.

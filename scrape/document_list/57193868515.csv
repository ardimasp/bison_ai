This work tackles the issue of decentralized corruption prevention by describing the method of doing heuristic analysis based on multiple data regarding corruption. There are four main data source used for the input of the system in this work, where each data corresponds to a city in a region. All the data are processed into corresponding index, while the indexes will be further used in index interpretation and suggestion mapping process. The output of this system is a decision support system for relevant decision making related to corruption prevention, visualized using Google Map API. This system will be very powerful in the long and tedious war against corruption, when used to its maximum potential. © 2019 IEEE.","civilian-based corruption prevention; corruption mapping index; corruption prevention","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Heuristic methods; Information management; Mapping; civilian-based corruption prevention; corruption mapping index; corruption prevention; Google map api; Heuristic analysis; Mapping process; Prevention systems; Technological advancement; Crime",,,,,"ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by Directorate General of Research and Development Strengthening, Indonesian Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi","Nawatmi, S., Korupsi dan Pertumbuhan Ekonomi Negara-Negara Asia Pasifik (2014) Jurnal Bisnis Dan Ekonomi, 21 (1); (2018) Slow, Imperfect Progress Across Asia Pacific, , https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/slowimperfect_progress_across_asia_pacific, Transparency International 21 February.

In current modern society, information technology exists as a multidisciplinary tool to solve lingering problems that could not be solved by traditional efforts. This paper aims to provide knowledge regarding identified efforts to fight corruption specifically in Indonesia region. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology is used as the methodology, and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow is used as framework to identify relevant records. Scopus database is used as data source. A total of 10 records are labelled as relevant to this research, and the findings are synthesized. It was found from the records that the main areas of interest for ICT research for corruption prevention in Indonesia are (1) information transparency, (2) operational enhancement, (3) success evaluation, (4) security and fraud, and (4) decision support. The findings are expected to assist future research in term of providing valuable insights on corruption prevention using ICT in Indonesia. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

To imagine the severances of it, 10.000 KM of highway can be built with that much amount of fund. Several responses has been done by Indonesian government to fight corruption from both prevention and persecution. This work focuses on the development of a web application aimed to provide insight to corruption case per province in Indonesia. The web application was developed using Machine Learning, specifically Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Web crawling and web scraping techniques are used to gather news content from 7 major news portal in Indonesia. Accuracy is measured by comparing correct prediction by ANN to its true value. Upon finding corruption news, data is saved and further analysis is done to establish the number of corruption news per region. Finally, the output is visualized using Google Map API. The purpose of this work is to provide regional depiction of corruption case to give further insight to be used by decision makers. Upon using this web application, objectivity of program development is expected to increase. The final output of the web application is a map of corruption case in Indonesia per region.

Nevertheless, there are still many occurrences of government officers abusing their offices to do an act of corruption. In this order, the central government should pay attention to every area in the nation to avoid corruption case. Meanwhile, the news media always constantly preach about corruption case, this makes the news media relevant for being one of the sources of measurement of corruption perception index (CPI). It is required to map the corruption case in Indonesia so the central government can pay attention to every region in Indonesia. To develop the mapping system, researchers use Naïve Bayes Classifier to classify which news articles talk about corruption and which news articles are not, before implementing a Naïve Bayes Classifier there are some text processing such as tokenizing, stopping, and stemming. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Economics; Mapping; Sodium; Text processing; Bayes Classifier; Central government; Corruption perception indices; Economic growths; Mapping systems; News articles; News media; Tokenizing; Crime",,,,,,"Ghosh, R., Siddique, M., (2014) Corruption, Good Governance and Economic Development: Contemporary Analysis and Case Studies.; Huang, J., Lu, J., Ling, C., (2003) Comparing Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and SVM with AUC and Accuracy.; Jang, S., Woo, W., 5W1H: Unified User-Centric Context (2005) Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing.; Malik, D., (2001) Dari Konstruksi Ke Dekonstruksi: Refleksi Atas Pemberitaan Televisi Kita.; Melgar, N., Rossi, M., Smith, T.W., The Perception of Corruption (2010) International Journal of Public Opinion Research, 22 (1), pp. 120-131; Murphy, K.P., (2006) Naive Bayes Classifiers Generative Classifiers, 4701, pp. 1-8; Olteanu, A., Peshterliev, S., Liu, X., Aberer, K., Web Credibility: Features Exploration and Credibility Prediction (2013) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), pp. 557-568; Persson, A., Rothstein, B., Teorell, J., Why Anti Corruption Reforms Fail - Systemic Corruption as a Collective Action Problem (2013) Governance, 26 (3), pp. 449-471; Rahimi, R., Shakeri, H., Reflection on Judicial System's Corruption and Offering Solutions to Promote its Safety (2016) Journal of Politics and Law, 9 (9), p. 187; Rohwer, A., Measuring Corruption: A Comparison between the Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index and the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators (2009) DICE, pp. 42-52; Schrenk, M., (2007) Webbots, Spiders, and Screen Scrapers.; Tala, F., (2003) A Study of Stemming Effects on Information Retrieval in Bahasa Indonesia; Tated, R.R., Ghonge, M.M., A survey on text mining - Techniques and application (2015) International Journal of Research in Advent Technology, 1, pp. 380-385; Uca, N., Ince, H., Sumen, H., The Mediator Effect of Logistics Performance Index on the Relation between Corruption Perception Index and Foreign Trade Volume (2016) European Scientific Journal, 12 (25), pp. 1857-7881; Yang, J.M., Cai, R., Wang, C., Huang, H., Zhang, L., Ma, W.Y., Incorporating Site-Level Knowledge for Incremental Crawling of Web Forums: A List-Wise Strategy (2009) Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1375-1383",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Computing and Applied Informatics, ICCAI 2016","14 December 2016 through 15 December 2016",,127044,17426588,,,,"English","J.

This study aims to examine 1) how is the construct of the Corruption Early Prevention as a Decision Support System for President of the Republic of Indonesia?, and 2) how is the design form of the system of Corruption Early Prevention as a Decision Support System for President of Republic of Indonesia? The research method is using Neuro-Research which is the collaboration of qualitative and quantitative research methods and the model development of Information Technology (IT).

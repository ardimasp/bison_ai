However, their business processes are often inefficiently managed, which increase the cost of operation. The current Enterprise Resource Planning system could address the problem, but the price is relatively expensive for current condition of SME in Indonesia. The problem continues when the business operation run in different places, where data inconsistencies reduce operation efficiency. Cloud-based ERP is a possible solution, but it is relatively slow to fully maximize the benefit. Therefore, new affordable solution with remote access, which use less internet bandwidth is needed to answer problems in implementing ERP. This study aims to analyze the problem and use the findings to provide a prototype that could address the existing problem. Through implementation of various technologies such as Single Page Application, Gzip Compression, and Webpack Module Bundler, the author successfully developed the prototype of ERP system. Several tests, including compatibility test and user acceptance test were performed to evaluate the prototype. Although this prototype has not been able cover the whole modules, the test results showed a satisfactory result in terms of accessibility and basic functionality. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","ERP; Single Page Application (SPA); SME; Web Application","Acceptance tests; Competition; Resource allocation; Software prototyping; Testbeds; Cost of operations; Data inconsistencies; Enterprise resource planning systems; Operation efficiencies; Single Page Application (SPA); Small medium enterprise; Various technologies; WEB application; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,"Development of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (Smes) and Large Enterprises, , http://www.depkop.go.id/berita-informasi/data-informasi/data-umkm, Ministry of Cooperation and SMEs Republic of Indonesia Online; Handayani, P.W., Hidayanto, A.N., Budi, I., Business process requirements for indonesian small medium enterprises (smes) in implementing enterprise resource planning (erp) and erp systems comparison (2013) Journal of Computers, 8 (9), pp. 2437-2441; Saputro, J.W., Handayani, P.W., Hidayanto, A.N., Budi, I., Roadmap of enterprise resource planning (erp) research for small and medium enterprises (smes) in indonesia (2010) International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems (ICACSIS); Raihana, G.F.H., Cloud ERP-a solution model (2012) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology & Security, 2, pp. 76-79; (2016) Improve Your Understanding of Web Applications, , https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-web-application-3486637, Nations D Online; Shimanorvsky, S., (2015) Multi Page Web Applications Vs Single Page Web Applications, , http://www.eikospartners.com/blog/multi-page-web-applications-vs.-single-page-web-applications, Online; Mikowski, M.S., Powell, J.C., (2013) Single Page Web Applications; Eckerson, W.W., Three tier client/server architectures: Achieving scalability, performance, and efficiency in client/server applications (1995) Open Information Systems, 3, pp. 46-50; Darwin, P.B., Kozlowski, P., (2013) AngularJS Web Application Development; Jain, N., Mangal, P., Mehta, D., AngularJS: A modern mvc framework in javascript (2015) Journal of Global Research in Computer Science, 5, pp. 17-23; About Nodejs, , https://nodejs.org/en/, Online; A Tutorial on Database Concepts, Sql Using Mysql, , http://www.atlasindia.com/sql.htm, Online; Nosql Databases Explained, , https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained, Online; Introduction of Gzip, , http://www.gzip.org/, Online; What Is Webpack, , http://webpack.github.io/docs/what-is-webpack.html, Online; Burger, R., (2016) The Ultimate Guide to Agile Software Development, , http://blog.capterra.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-agile-software-development/, Online","Kosala, R.R.; Computer Science Department, Indonesia; email: rkosala@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

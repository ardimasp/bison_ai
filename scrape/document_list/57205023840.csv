Quality of service will have an effect on the accomplishment of an organization's aim. Suitable and precise evaluation model will help the vocational high school in arranging a master plan to enhance the quality of education services provided. Kirkpatrick's model became the fundamental framework in this case study. This model was usually utilized to evaluate the impact of corporate training to the development of staff and also the impact to organization performance. In this paper, we perform case study for one of the vocational high school in Jakarta. There is a concern from the school about how to conduct evaluation of the teaching activity, students performance, and institution performance. In this paper, we propose a web-based e-learning system using Kirkpatrick evaluation model to solve this problem. We built the e-learning application using codeigniter framework. From the result, it can be seen that the developed system can provide platform for the school to evaluate the quality of teaching activity based on the students feedback, evaluate the performance of students after attending class, and also evaluate how the trend of institution performance year by year. © 2018 IEEE.","codeigniter; e-learning; Kirkpatrick model; software engineering","Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Education computing; Information management; Personnel training; Quality of service; Software engineering; Students; Websites; codeigniter; e-Learning application; Kirkpatrick modeling; Kirkpatrick's models; Organization performance; Quality of education; Teaching activities; Web-based e-learning systems; Quality control",,,,"Binus University","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The publication of this research work is supported by Bina Nusantara University.","Indonesia, P.R., Peraturan Pemerintah Republik Indonesia nomor 19 tahun 2005 tentang standar nasional pendidikan Departemen Pendidikan Nasional Republik Indonesia, 2005; Mathison, S., (2005) Encyclopedia of Evaluation, , Sage; Praslova, L., Adaptation of Kirkpatricks four level model of training criteria to assessment of learning outcomes and program evaluation in Higher Education (2010) Educ.

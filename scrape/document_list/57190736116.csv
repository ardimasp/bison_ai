Combination of TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) and Phrase Reinforcement Algorithm are used as the methodology to do the automatic summarization. We use 2 sentences as the final summary result. It contains all essential information given by Twitter data. At the end of this paper, we describe the evaluation result by analyzing result using Precision and ROUGE. Based on the result, we conclude that TF-IDF and Phrase Reinforcement Algorithm can successfully generate summary and it works well enough on hashtags that do not have such lot variants of the word. Generally, summary results quality is quite low because the data still contains too much noise. The precision is 0.327 and ROUGE-1 is 0.3087.","Automatic summarization; Hashtag; Phrase reinforcement algorithm; Summary; TF-IDF; Twitter","Information management; Inverse problems; Reinforcement; Social networking (online); Text processing; World Wide Web; Automatic summarization; Hashtag; Reinforcement algorithms; Summary; TF-IDF; Twitter; Algorithms",,,,,"Lloret, E., Palomar, M., Challenging issues of automatic summarization: Relevance detection and qualitybased evaluation (2009) International Journal of Informatica, 34 (1); Kageback, M., Mogren, O., Tahmasebi, N., Dubhashi, D., Extractive summarization using continuous vector space models (2014) Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Continuous Vector Space Models and their Compositionality (CVSC) @ EACL, pp. 31-39; Cheung, J.C.K., (2008) Comparing Abstractive and Extractive Summarization of Evaluative Text: Controversiality and Content Selection, , Thesis of University of British Columbia, Minors in Linguistics and German; Silvia, Meiliana, Rukmana, P., Aprilia, V.R., Suhartono, D., Wongso, R., Summarizing text for Indonesian language by using latent dirichlet allocation and genetic algorithm (2014) Proceeding of International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics (EECSI 2014), pp. 148-153. , Yogyakarta, Indonesia; Sharifi, B., Hutton, M.A., Kalita, J.K., Experiments in microblog summarization (2010) Proc. of IEEE Second International Conference on Social Computing; Winatmoko, Y.A., Khodra, M.L., Automatic summarization of tweets in providing Indonesian trending topic explanation (2013) The 4th International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics, pp. 1027-1033; Attia, M., Arabic tokenization system (2007) Proceedings of the Workshop on Computational Approaches to Semitic Languages: Common Issues and Resources, (CIR' 07), pp. 65-72. , ACM, USA; Naradhipa, A.R., Purwarianti, A., Sentiment classification for Indonesian message in social media (2012) International Conference on Cloud Computing and Social Networking (ICCCSN), pp. 1-5. , Bandung, Indonesia","Suhartono, D.; School of Computer Science, Indonesia; email: dsuhartono@binus.edu",,"","International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering (WCSE)","2016 6th International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering, WCSE 2016","17 June 2016 through 19 June 2016",,122547,,9789811100086,,,"English","Int.

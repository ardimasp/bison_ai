EFEAS is developed using a microcontroller, android application and solar panel devices. Microcontroller is used to develop a main device of EFEAS that functions to activate siren, send SMS, switch electrical power from solar panels to conventional source or vice versa, and communicate with an android smartphone. Android application is developed and used to connect the android smartphone to the system. This system will activate sirene, send alerts and the location of the house when the panic button pushed by the user. With the implementation of this system residents are expected to be able to get faster handling when there are hazardous conditions in the house. This system developed can achieve the objective of being able to be operated using an Android smartphone to control all components within the system with 100% successful rate to send SMS within 13 seconds and 100% successful rate to switch between solar panel and adaptor. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Android Application; Arduino Uno; ESP8266; Home security system; Panic button","Controllers; Environmental protection; Fasteners; Microcontrollers; Security systems; Signaling; Smartphones; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Android applications; Arduino Uno; ESP8266; Home security systems; Panic button; Android (operating system)",,,,,"(2018) Statistik Kriminal 2018, , https://www.bps.go.id/publication/2018/12/26/89c06f465f944f3be39006a1/statistik-kriminal-2018.html, Badan Pusat Statistik; Wijaya, L.D., (2019) Punya Senjata Api, Polisi: Pencuri Tak Ragu Tembak Penghalangnya, , https://metro.tempo.co/read/1171816/punya-senjata-api-polisi-pencuri-tak-ragu-tembak-penghalangnya, Arjanto, D (Ed.); Viswanatha, V., Venkata Siva, R.R., Kp, A., Multilevel Home Scurity System using Arduino & GSM (2018) Journal for Research, 4, pp. 1-6; Thakur, S., Verma, M., Sahu, L., Security System using Arduino Microcontroller (2018) International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology, 5, pp. 3124-3127; Kumar, B.S., Ramesh, S., Burglar System using Arduino and PIR Sensor with SMS Alert (2017) International Journal of Current Engineering & Scientific Research, 4, pp. 16-22; Arf, S., Aridharsan, A., Android based Automation and Security System for Smart Homes (2017) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology Research, 5, pp. 26-30; Bolaji, A.Q., Kamaldeen, R.A., Samson, O.F., Abdullahi, A.T., Abubakar, S.K., A Digitalized Smart Home Automation and Security System via Bluetoot/Wi-Fi using Android Platform (2017) International Journal of Information and Communication Sciences, 2 (6), pp. 93-99; Chandramohan, J., Nagarajan, R., Sateeshkumar, K., Ajithkumar, N., Gopinath, P.A., Ranjithkumar, S., Intelligent Smart Home Automation and Security System Using Arduino and Wi-Fi (2015) International Journal of Engineering & Computer Science, 6, pp. 20694-20698; Seosa, O., Promise, E., GSM Based Intelligent Home Security for Intrusion Detection (2014) International Journal of Engineering and Technology, 4, pp. 595-605; Parab, A.S., Joglekar, A., Implementation of Home Security System using GSM Module and Microcontroller (2015) International Journal of Computer Science & Information Technologies, 6, pp. 2950-2953; Kodali, R.K., Jain, V., Bose, S., Boppana, L., IoT Based Smart Security and Home Automation System (2017) International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation System, pp. 1286-1289; Hutabarat, D.P., Budijono, S., Saleh, R., Development of home security system using ESP8266 and android smartphone as the monitoring tool (2018) IOP Conf.

Hydroponics has become a reality for greenhouse growers in virtually all climates. Large hydroponic installations exist throughout the world for growing flowers, vegetables and some short period fruit like tomato and cucumber. In soilless culture, we must maintain stable pH and conductivity level of nutrient solution to make plant grow well, large variation of pH of certain time will poisoned plant. This paper describes development complete automation hydroponic system, from maintaining stable nutrient composition (conductivity and pH), grow light, and monitor plant environment such as CO2, temperature and humidity. The heart of our automation is ARM Cortex-M4 from ST Microelectronic running ARM mbed OS, the official Real Time Operating System (RTOS) for ARM Cortex-M microcontroller. Using RTOS gives us flexibility to have multithreaded process. Results show that system capable to control desired concentration level with variation of less than 3%, pH sensor show good accuracy 5.83% from pH value 3.23-10. Growing light intensity measurement show result 105 μmol/m2/s therefore we need turn on the light at least 17 hours/day to fulfil plant light requirement. RTOS give good performance with latency and jitter less than 15 us, system overall show good performance and accuracy for automating hydroponic plant in vegetative phase of growth. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","ARM Cortex-M; growing light; Hydroponic; mbed OS; nutrient solution; RTOS","Computer operating systems; Microcontrollers; Microelectronics; Nutrients; pH; pH sensors; Arm cortices; Hydroponic; Light-intensity measurement; Nutrient solution; Nutrient-rich solutions; Real time operating system; RTOS; Temperature and humidities; ARM processors",,,,,"Ahmad, R., Ahad, K., Iqbal, R., Muhammad, A., Acute Poisoning Due to Commercial Pesticides in Multan (2002) Pakistan Journal of Medcal Sciences, 18, pp. 227-231; Roberto, K., (2003) How-To Hydroponic, , 4 (Futuregarden); Sahare, V., Jain, P., Automated Hydroponic System using Psoc4 Prottyping Kit to Deliver Nutrients Solution Directly to Roots of Plants on Time Basis (2015) International Journal of Advanced Research in Electrical, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, 4, pp. 8765-8770; Mishra, R.I., Jain, P., Design and Implementation of Automatic Hydroponics System using ARM Processor (2015) International Journal of Advanced Research in Electrical, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, 4 (8), pp. 6935-6940; Umamaheswari, S., Preethi, A., Pravin, E., Dhanusha, R., Integrating Scheduled Hydroponic System IEEE International Conference on Advances in Computer Applications (ICACA), , (Coimbatore, India, 2016); Torres, A., Lopez, R.F., (2012) Measuring Daily Light Integral in A Greenhouse, , (Purdue); Olle, M., Viršile, A., The effect of light-emitting diode lighting on greenhouse plant growth and quality (2013) Agricultural and Food Science, 22, pp. 223-234; Massa, G.D., Kim, H.-H., Wheeler, R.M., Mitchell, C.A., Plant Productivity in Response to LED Ligthing (2008) HortScience, 43, pp. 1951-1956; Philips, (2014) Philips Ligth Recipes in Horticulture, , (Philips); (2017) Open Agriculture Initative (OpenAg), , https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/open-agriculture-openag/overview/, MIT Media Lab, [Online]; Li, Q., Yao, C., (2003) Real-Time Concepts for Embedded Systems, , R.-T.

The method of this research is by literature review method, experiment method and designing method. Analysis of the research will be done by collecting data and information from the reading of sensors that is used and compare the information that we get with the actual condition. The sensors are distance sensor IR Range, direction sensor digital compass module, camera and comparing latency of different Linux kernel. The result that we get are like the best reading distance of the distance sensor which is the IR Ranger are ±3-30 cm, digital compass module can read the value of a direction and produce the value well if there is not any material that contains magnetism that can disturb the reading of digital compass module, camera can detect object well by their color and by using the result of IR Ranger reading and digital compass module, robot can work and move independently in tracing the way and keep distance with the object. © 2015 The Authors.

They are also both conversational technologies and constructivist learning tools. Their interactive, collaborative, user-friendly, and instant archival features have transformed blogs into effective tools for enhancing case-based teaching methods in the asynchronous nature of the online environment. This study investigated the student populace's acceptance of the blog technology through the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework. UTAUT integrates eight theories from social psychology and sociology in order to examine the effects of major factors on behavioral intention and actual use of blog to learn e-business course materials and topic discussions. The results showed that both social influence and performance expectancy had a significant relationship with behavioral intention, whereas effort expectancy did not. In this study, behavioral intention did not have a significant relationship with actual usage level of blogs as a learning tool.","Blog; e-learning; Technology acceptance; UTAUT",,,,,,"Hsu, J., Innovative Technologies for Education and Learning: Education and Knowledge-Oriented Applications of Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts, and More (2008) International Journal of Web-Based Learning and Teaching Technologies, 3 (3), pp. 62-81; Lu, H.-P., Hsiao, K.-L., Understanding Intention to continuously Share Information on Weblogs (2007) Internet Research, 17 (4), pp. 345-361. , DOI: 10.1108/10662240710828030; Chen, C., Wu, J., Yang, S.C., Accelerating the Use of Weblogs as an Alternative Method to Deliver Case-Based Learning (2008) International Journal On E-Learning, 7 (2), pp. 331-349; Ayub, A.F.M., Tarmizi, R.A., Jafaar, W., Marzuki, W., Ali, W., Zah, W., Luan, W.S., Factors Influencing Students Use a Learning Management System Portal: Perspective from Higher Education Students (2010) International Journal of Education and Information Technologies, 2 (4), pp. 101-108; Ellison, N.B., Wu, Y., Blogging in the Classroom: A Preliminary Exploration of Student Attitudes and Impact on Comprehension (2008) Journal of Educational Multimedia and Hypermedia, 17 (1), pp. 99-122; Wang, S.-K., Hsu, H.-Y., Reflection from Using Blogs to Expand In-class Discussion (2008) Tech Trend, 52 (3), pp. 81-85; El-Bakry, H.M., Mastorakis, N., Activation of Informal Learning with E-Learning Technology (2009) Proceedings of the 8th WSEAS International Conference On Education and Educational Technology (EDU'09), p. 2009. , University of Genova, Genova, Italy; Vlahovic, N., Pozgaj, Z., Vuksic, V.B., Managing Online Learning Resources Using Web 2.0 Tools a Croatian Experience (2011) International Journal of Education and Information Technologies, 1 (5), pp. 59-68; Tasir, Z., Al-Dheleai, Y.M.H., Harun, J., Shukor, N.A., Students Perception towards the Use of Social Networking as an e-Learning Platform (2011) Proceedings of the 10th WSEAS International Conference On Education and Educational Technology (EDU'11), p. 2011. , Penang, Malaysia; Fred, D.D., Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, and User Acceptance of Information Technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3), pp. 319-340; Venkatesh, V., Morris, M.G., Davis, G.B., Davis, F.D., User Acceptance of Information Technology: Toward A Unified View (2003) MIS Quarterly, 27 (3), pp. 425-478; Thompson, R.L., Higgins, C.A., Howell, J.M., Personal Computing: Toward a Conceptual Model of Utilization (1991) MIS Quarterly, 15 (1), pp. 124-143; Moore, G.C., Benbasat, I., Development of an Instrument to Measure the Perceptions of Adopting an Information Technology Innovation (1991) Information Systems Research, 2 (3), pp. 192-222; Compeau, D.R., Higgins, C.A., Computer Self Efficacy: Development of a Measure and Initial Test (1995) MIS Quarterly, 19 (2), pp. 189-211; Devellis, R.F., (1991) Scale Development: Theory & Applications, , Newbury Park, CA: SAGE Publications; Levine, R., Locke, C., Searls, D., Weinberger, D., (2000) The Cluetrain Mainfesto: The End of Business As Usual, , Cambridge, MA: Perseus; Ferris, S.P., Wilder, H., Uses and Potentials of Wikis in the Classroom (2006) Innovate, 1 (5); Seitzinger, J., (2006) Be Constructive: Blogs, Podcasts, and Wikis As Constructivist Learning Tools, p. 2006. , Learning Solutions, July; Abazi-Bexheti, L., Kadriu, A., Ahmedi, L., (2010) Measurement and Assessment of Learning Management System Usage In Proceedings of the 6th WSEAS/IASME International Conference On Educational Technologies (EDUTE'10), p. 2010. , Kantaoui, Sousse, Tunisia; Dasgupda, S., Haddad, M., Weiss, P., dan Bermudez, E., User Acceptance of Case Tools in System Analysis and Design: An Empirical Study (2007) Journal of Informatics Education Research, 9 (1), pp. 51-78; Sedana, I.G.N., Wijaya St., W., UTAUT Model for Understanding Learning Management System (2010) Internetworking Internet Journal, 2 (2), pp. 27-32; Stoel, L., Lee, K.H., Modeling the Effect of Experience on Student Acceptance of Web-based Courseware (2003) Internet Research, 13, pp. 364-375; Coulter, P., Draper, L., Blogging It into Them: Weblogs in Information Literacy Instruction (2006) Journal of Library Administration, 45 (1), pp. 101-115; Nardi, B.A., Schiano, D.J., Gumbrecht, M., Swartz, L., (2004) Why We Blog.

The license plate recognition is implemented using artificial neural network, where training of the neural network is carried out in a desktop computer instead of mobile device to speed up the training using back propagation algorithm. Result of the training is the artificial neural network along with their weight is implemented in the mobile device to recognize characters in license plate. The training result showed that the neural network is able to recognize 88.2% characters in sample images outside the training set. The image processing and neural network implemented in the mobile device managed to recognize an average of 71% characters in sample license plate images which are categorized as having good image quality. Automobile license plate information is also saved in database inside the mobile device. © 2012 IIJ.","Android-base; Back-propagation algorithm; License plate recognition; Neural network; Pre-trained",,,,,,"Wang, W., (2009) License Plate Recognition Algorithm Based on Radial Basis Function Neural Networks, pp. 38-41. , Proceeding of International Symposium on Intelligent Ubiquitous Computing and Education;; Chen, N., Li, X., (2010) Research of License Plate Recognition based on Improved BP Neural Network, , Proceeding of International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling V11-482-V11-485; Chen, H.-F., Chen, C.-Y., Yang, S.-J., Ho, C.C., (2012) Android-Based Patrol Robot Featuring Automatic License Plate Recognition, pp. 117-122. , Proceeding of Computing, Communications and Applications Conference; Mutholib, A., Gunawan, T.S., Kartiwi, M., (2012) Design and implementation of automatic number plate recognition on android platform, pp. 540-543. , Proceeding of International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering;; Zheng, L., Samali, B., He, X., Yang, L.T., (2010) Accuracy Enhancement for License Plate Recognition, pp. 511-516. , Proceeding of 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT); Kasaei, S.H.M., Kasaei, S.M.M., (2011) Extractation and Recognition of the Vehicle License Plate for Passing Under Outside Environment, pp. 234-237. , Proceeding of European Intelligence and Security Informatics Conference; Megalingam, R.K., Krishna, P., Somarajan, P., Pillai, V.A., Hakkim, R.U.I., (2010) Extraction of License Plate Region in Automatic License Plate Recognition, pp. 496-501. , Proceeding of International Conference on Mechanical and Electrical Technology (ICMET);; Feng, Z., Fang, K., (2011) Research and Implementation of an Improved License Plate Recognition Algorithm, pp. 2300-2305. , Proceeding of 4th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics (BMEI);; Vesnin, E.N., Tsarev, V.A., Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis (2006) Segmentation of Images of License Plates, 16 (1), pp. 108-110; Sirithinaphong, T., Chamnongthai, K., (1999) The Recognition of Car License Plate for Automatic Parking System, pp. 455-457. , Proceeding of 5th International Symposium on Signal Processing and Its Application Brisbane; Beale, M.H., Hagan, M.T., Demuth, H.B., (2012), Neural Network Toolbox™ - User's Guide; Greensted, A., Otsu Thresholding, , http://www.labbookpages.co.uk/software/imgProc/otsuThreshold.html, Retrieved on Nov 1st, 2011, from The Lab Book Pages; Global Image Threshold Using Otsu's Method- MATLAB, , http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/images/ref/graythresh.html, Anonymous Retrieved on Nov 1st, 2011, from MathWorks:","Romadhon, R.K.; Computer Engineering Department, , Jakarta, Indonesia; email: rizqi_batavia@yahoo.com",,,,,,,,19429703,,,,"English","Internetworking Indones.

In swarm robot systems, each robot must cooperate with other robots in order to perform a given task. The main obstacle in swarm robot research is the cost of making robots. Building one robot with limited capabilities commonly has to spend substantial amount of money and certainly making robots for intelligent systems research need much more investment. In this paper, we would like to present the development of affordable mobile robot, but also having powerful capabilities and intelligence. The mobile robot is specifically designed and made to be used as a stand-alone or in swarm robot systems. It is essential that the mobile robot has learning ability to adapt the dynamic environments. Furthermore, for swarm robot systems, each mobile robot must be able to communicate with other robots in order to coordinate each other. In our research, we used differential drive model for mobile robot locomotion and then apply the model through Android smartphone based controller. The mobile robot was constructed by using two actuators on the right and left side, and one castor wheel which has no steering system and can move freely. The differences velocity between left and right actuators determines the direction and final position of the mobile robot. The angular velocity of two main actuators is set by Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) parameter in IOIO board microcontroller. In our experiment, we showed that the capability of our robot in performing several movement tasks. We are sure that Android based robotic platforms are ideal candidates for affordable robotics for swarm robot system research. © 2017 The Authors.

The focus is to discover how communication used by Radio Taiwan International (RTI) for Indonesian citizen can build a good image for governments. The result of this study shows: First, image building through radio broadcasting for governments can be done through the role of radio as a medium of communication between the government and local communities. Second, the method of delivering the message for female radio listeners is a two-way communication in which the broadcaster has to prepare direct conversation with the listeners or provide time to speak directly as a friend in the real world. Third, radio programmes that are ethnically coloured are an effective form of radio programme for citizens abroad that supports image building. The conclusion of this study is that image building through radio can be done for female Indonesian citizens in Taiwan because radio as a medium of socialisation works as two-way communication and it can be ethnically coloured. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Image building; Indonesian; Radio Taiwan International",,,,,,,"Anderson, P.J., Egglestone, P., The development of effective quality measures relevant to the future practice of BBC news journalism online (2012) Journalism Sage Journal, 13 (7), pp. 923-941; (2012) Kian Banyak Wanita Indonesia Jadi Pengantin Asing di Taiwan, , http://www.antaranews.com/berita/1141877923/kian-banyak-wanita-indonesia-jadi-pengantin-asing-di-taiwan, Retrieved December 21, 2012, from; Conway, B., Cahill, L.M., Corcoran, M.P., The 'miracle' of Fatima: Media framing and the regeneration of a Dublin housing estate (2012) Journalism Sage Journals, 13 (5), pp. 551-571; Field, S., (2009) Carrer Opportunities in Radio, , New York: Infobase Publishing; (2012) Rangkaian Kunjungan Menteri Tenaga Kerja Dan Transmigrasi Dan Rombongan Ke Taiwan Untuk Peningkatan Kesejahteraan TKI, , http://kdei-taipei.org/id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=411:rangkaian-kunjungan-menteri-tenaga-kerja-dan-transmigrasi-dan-rombongan-ke-taiwan-untuk-peningkatan-kesejahteraan-tki&catid=34:berita&Itemid=55, Retrieved December 12, 2012, from; Ma, E.K., Compressed modernity in south China (2010) Global Media and Communication, 8 (3), pp. 289-308; (2001) Jurnalistik Radio: Menata Profesionalisme Reporter Dan Penyiar, , Masduki.

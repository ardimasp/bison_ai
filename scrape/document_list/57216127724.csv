One of ""ready to eat seasoning"" producer, PT Kiantaka Rasa, KR, has planning to be more popular among the ""end user"" customer, by launch their ready to eat seasoning series. Their goal of new packaging is expected to attract public's interest for buying KR's products. In this research, we use Kansei Engineering, Quality Function Deployment, QFD, and Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) in purpose ergonomic, simple and attractive packaging and products. Nine prototype packaging design was offer into focused discussion group respondent, using Kansai word then Manova, the result, Design 2 is the best design. So as to fit the ""end client"" desire for the surface of fine flavors, fiery taste, reusable and solid bundling, we utilized QFD technique. The result, the seasoning particle size is less than 250 microns, increase composition of spicy material, bottle design is slim shape with a thickness of 0.05 cm, the bottle cap has many small holes for sprinkle option. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Kansei Engineering; Multivariate Analysis of Variance; Packaging Design; Quality Function Deployment; Statistical Package for the Social Sciences","Bottles; Multivariant analysis; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Quality control; Quality function deployment; Sales; Bottle designs; Bottle packaging; Consumer Goods; Discussion Groups; Kansei Engineering; Multivariate analysis of variances; Packaging designs; Statistical packages; Packaging",,,,,"Nagamachi, M., Lokman, A.M., (2015) Kansei Innovation: Practical Design Applications for Product and Service Development; Nagamachi, M., Kansei/affective engineering and history of Kansei/affective engineering in the world (2011) Kansei/affective Engineering, 13, pp. 1-12; Jensen, F., (2017) Quality Function Deployment: The Evolved 4-Phase Model Lulu.com; Maritan, D., (2015) Practical Manual of Quality Function Deployment, pp. 1-32; Franceschini, F., (2001) Advanced Quality Function Deployment; Warner, R.M., (2013) Applied Statistics: From Bivariate Through Multivariate Techniques: From Bivariate Through Multivariate Techniques; Warne, R.T., A Primer on Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) for Behavioral Scientists (2014) Practical Assessment, Research & Evaluation, 19, pp. 1-10; Abdi, H., Williams, L.J., (2010) Encyclopedia of Research Design, 1-5; Bhandari, B.R., Bansal, N., Zhang, M., Schuck, P., (2013) Handbook of Food Powders: Processes and Properties; Gilbert, M., (2016) Brydson's Plastics Materials; Saeed, K., Nagashima, T., (2012) Biometrics and Kansei Engineering",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

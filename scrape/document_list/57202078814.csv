This paper presents one part of smart appliances in the form of a module that can be attached directly to the present refrigerator. The module was built based on Arduino, Raspberry Pi and sensors which can change an ordinary refrigerator to smart one with its three functions. First, it can inform items stored in the refrigerator. Second, it can order unavailable items to the supplier, and third, it can display recipes according to the items therein. This module is being registered for a simple patent and will be manufactured widely with affordable price. This module will be favorable choice since users don't have to discharge their current refrigerator but change it into a smart one by applying the module. In the future, the module will be expanded to other appliances and each appliance can communicate to each other and save their information in the cloud. Moreover, an Androidbased system has been developed to be installed in the smartphone for online access. © 2018, Internetworking Indonesia.","Android-based; Arduino; Raspberry Pi; Short messages service (SMS); Smart appliances; Smart refrigerator",,,,,,"Pedrasa, M.A.A., Spooner, T.D., MacGill, I.F., ""Coordinated scheduling of residential distributed energy to optimize smart home energy services, "" (2010) IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 1 (2), pp. 134-143; Harper, R., (2005) Inside the smart home, , 1st ed., London: Springer-Verlag; Jiang, L., Liu, D.Y., Yang, B., ""Smart home research, "" (2004) 2004 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, , Shanghai; Newman, J.W., Werbel, R.A., ""Multivariate analysis of brand loyalty for major household appliances, "" (1973) Journal of Marketing Research, 10 (4), pp. 404-409; Bayus, B., ""Brand loyalty and marketing strategy: an application to home appliances, "" (1992) Marketing Science, 6 (1), pp. 21-38; Anilkumar, N., ""The influence of marketing on consumer attitude functions for kitchen appliances with special reference to a study at Kochi Metro, "" (2013) Advances in Management, 6 (1), p. 54; Kiyomatsu, H., ""Refrigerator with a function to confirm items stored therein"", , 6 June 2002; Han, D.M., Lim, J.H., ""Smart home energy management system using IEEE 802.15.4 and zigbee, "" (2010) IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, 56 (3), pp. 1403-1410; Kuwik, P., Largi, T., York, M., Crump, D., Livingston, D., Squire, J.C., ""The smart medical refrigerator, "" (2005) IEEE Potentials, 24 (1), pp. 42-45; Yuen, J., (2004) ""Mini size solid state refrigerator with CD player and radio"", , 10 February; Roh, Y., (2002) ""Internet refrigerator and operating method thereof"", , 28 May; Badamasi, Y.A., ""The working principle of an Arduino, "" (2014) 11th International Conference on Electronics, Computer and Computation (ICECCO), , Abuja, Nigeria; Barrett, S., (2012) Arduino Microcontroller Processing for Everyone!

Testing vehicles in the process requires time efficiency and accurate service output to decide whether the vehicle is roadworthy or not. In this study, the application of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is considered more appropriate in solving existing problems by weighting the criteria of technical testing and administrative testing, where there are four criterias are used such as the identity of the owner / authorized, application letter, type test registration certificate and vehicle license. The results of this study are web-based applications that regulate the hierarchy starting from the beginning of the registration process, testing, ratification of service outputs and various kinds of reporting so that the supervisor as the main person responsible for ensuring the safety of the tested vehicle can be faster, more precise and comprehensive in making the decision. © 2020 ©2006-2020 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

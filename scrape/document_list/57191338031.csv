There is much information and knowledge that are discussed among a lecturer and students in forums as a part of the learning process. The motivation of this study is to evaluate the learning process in a discussion forum through a dashboard, namely, the Dashboard of Knowledge (DoK). The DoK is formed using an Information Retrieval Architecture and Entity Relationship Diagram that is designed using four category interfaces. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the learning evaluation through the DoK is measured by a survey. The survey is conducted using three out of four dimensions of multi-criteria of the Web-based E-Learning System (WELS), namely, the Learner Interface, the System Context, and Personalization. The respondents of the survey are the heads of department that are DoK users. The results show that most respondents strongly agree that the DoK is useful for evaluating the learning in a discussion forum. This is exhibited by the survey results that show an average score of 3.53 out of 4.00 and 84.32% satisfaction. These results reveal that the DoK can effectively assist heads of department in monitoring the effectiveness of the learning process in a discussion forum. © 2013 IEEE.","Data warehouses; discussion forums; e-learning","Data warehouses; E-learning; Surveys; Discussion forum; Entity relationship diagrams; Four dimensions; Learning evaluations; Learning management system; Learning process; Personalizations; Web-based e-learning systems; Learning systems",,,,,"Garrison, D., Kanuka, H., Blended learning: Uncovering its transformative potential in higher education (2004) Internet Higher Edu., 7 (2), pp. 95-105. , Apr; Tripathi, R., Kurle, D., Jalgaonkar, S., Sarkate, P., Rege, N., Implementation of supplemental E-learning models for blended learning in pharmacology (2017) Nat.

Despite a discussion is opened by submitting a thread as the topic of discussion, however, the discussion may open out to different topics. This paper aims to present a model to find out a topic of discussion through latent semantic approach, named Topics Finding Model (TFM). The model proposes a complete step to reveal the topic of discussion from a thread in a discussion forum, consisting of the pre-processing text document, corpus classification and finding a topic. The model can be applied in various discussion forums and various languages with a few adjustments, such as stop-word removal list and stemming algorithm. The data were obtained from discussion forum in a learning management system. The data consist of 1050 posts divided into three different course subjects: information systems, management, and character building. The reason for using several course subjects is to observe consistency of the model. F-measure was used to measure the effectiveness of the model, and the results showed that the TFM was consistent and effective to reveal the topic of discussion, with a good precision. However, the recall can still be increased in a further study. © 2019, The Author(s).","Discussion forum; Latent semantic; Learning management system; Topics finding model",,,,,,"Baeza-Yates, R., Ribeiro-Neto, B., (2011) Modern Information Retrieval: The Concept and Technology behind Search (Second Edition), , Addison-Wesley Professional Harlow; Benedetti, F., Beneventano, D., Bergamaschi, S., Simonini, G., Computing inter-document similarity with context semantic analysis (2018) Information Systems, 80, pp. 136-147; Berger, A., Lafferty, J., Information retrieval as statistical translation (1999) In Proceedings of the 22Nd Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, , https://doi.org/10.1145/312624.312681; Botev, V., Marinov, K., Schäfer, F., Word importance-based similarity of documents metric (WISDM): Fast and scalable document similarity metric for analysis of scientific documents (2017) Proceedings of the 6Th International Workshop on Mining Scientific Publications, 7, pp. 17-23. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3127526.3127530; Cutting, D.R., Karger, D.R., Pedersen, J.O., Tukey, J.W., Scatter/gather: A cluster-based approach to browsing large document collections (2017) ACM SIGIR Forum, 51, pp. 148-159. , &; Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (1999) Proceedings of the fifteenth conference on uncertainty, pp. 1-7; Ezen-Can, A., Boyer, K.E., Kellogg, S., Booth, S., Unsupervised modeling for understanding MOOC discussion forums: A learning analytics approach (2015) In Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, pp. 146-150; Hofmann, T., Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (1999) Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 289-296; Hofmann, T., Unsupervised learning by probabilistic latent semantic analysis (2001) Machine Learning, 42 (1-2), pp. 177-196; Hong, C., Chen, W., Zheng, W., Shan, J., Chen, Y., Zhang, Y., Parallelization and characterization of probabilistic latent semantic analysis (2008) Parallel processing, 2008.

The aim of this paper was to determine the appropriate topics for a discussion forum for learning management systems through enhanced probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) with the corpus classifier algorithm. In preparing the paper, the methods used were PLSA and the classifying process, which classifies the documents to become a corpus based on the similarity word approach. The similarity word is influenced by the term-frequency of the word in the document. The novel concept in this paper is the corpus classifier algorithm. The experiment was conducted using three approaches to discover the topic, and it used 4,868 distinct words from 234 documents. The documents were contained in three threads subject. The post of the discussion forum is the text document. The performance of the result was measured by the f-measure, which was calculated for each thread subject. The corpus classifier algorithm was used in the second approach, and third approach increased the average f-measure values for the second and third thread subjects by approximately 24 and 17%, respectively. © BEIESP.","Corpus classification; Discussion forum; PLSA; Similarity word; Topic findings",,,,,,"Chowdhury, A.K., Shanmugan, V., Information Technology: Impacts on Environment and Sustainable (2015) Pertanika J.

The more Software Developers means the more competition in Software Development. Software metric for effort estimation is a strategy to use metrics related to effort estimation in software development becomes necessary to determine the effort required to develop the system and hence determine pricing (in the case of software house). Several methods exist to estimate effort. This research discusses the Use Case Point Method using a Student Desk Portal as the study case. The effort calculated based on Use Case method may differ from the actual case. In this paper, the differences are analyzed, and an adjustment factor is constructed to resolve the differences between the effort estimated by use case point and the actual effort placed in the actual software development.

The measurement of the complexity is based on control flow structure and time processing. The control flow structure is illustrated into flowgraph and measured by number of out-degree and number of in-degree. The algorithm is coded in C programming language. The sorting experiment uses four data sets: 100,000 random words, 50,000 random words, 100,000 random integer numbers, and 50,000 random integer numbers to measure the time processing. The result of the measurement explains that the bubble sort algorithm has the complexity more than others. © 2016 IEEE.","flowgraph; measurement; sorting","C (programming language); Flow structure; Graphic methods; Information management; Measurements; Sorting; Bubble sort; Control-flow structures; flowgraph; In-Degree; Integer numbers; Sort algorithm; Sorting algorithm; Time processing; Computational complexity",,,,,"Ying, Y., Yu, P., Gan, Y., Experimental study on the five sort algorithms (2011) IEEE, , 978-1-4244-9439-2; Deitel, P., Deitel, H., C How to Program (2010) Pearson Education Inc, , 6th edition,978-0-13-612356-9; Kalid, Sorting algorithms Better Explained, , https//betterexplained.com/articles/sorting-algorithms, accessed at September 18th 2016; Cormen, T.H., Leiserson, C.E., Rivest, R.L., Stein, C., (2009) Introduction to Algorithms, , MIT Press eBook, 3rd edition; Jadoon, S., Solehria, S.F., Qayum, M., Optimized selection sort algorithm is faster than insertion sort algorithm: A Comparative Study (2011) InInternational Journal of Electrical & Computer Sciences IJECSIJENS, 11; Astrachan, O., Bubble sort: An archaeological algorithmic analysis (2003) SIGCSE Bull., 35, pp. 1-5; Kumari, A., Chakraborty, S., Software complexity: Astatistical case study through insertion sort (2007) Applied Mathematics and Computation, 190, pp. 40-50; Fenton, N., Bieman, J., (2015) Software Metrics: A Rigorous and Practical Approach, , Third Edition, CRC Press; Necula, G., Mcpeak, S., Rahul, S., Weimer, W., CIL: Intermediate language and tools for analysis and transformation of C programs (2002) International Conference on Compiler Construction, pp. 213-228; Hecht, M., Ullman, J., Flowgraph reducibility (1972) Journal on Computing, 1, pp. 188-202","Setiawan, R.; Computer Science Department, Indonesia; email: reina@binus.edu",,"BINUS Univerity;IEEE Indonesia Section;Wiley","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2016","16 November 2016 through 18 November 2016",,127842,,9781509033522,,,"English","Proc.

The result shows that our performance can cover the failure in stemming reduplicated words of confix-stripping approach. © 2016 IEEE.","indonesian language; information retrieval; stemming","Computers; Electrical engineering; Information retrieval; Mathematical techniques; Foreign language; Indonesian languages; stemming; Text document; Computer science",,,,,"Sharma, D., Cse, M., Stemming algorithms: A comparative study and their analysis (2012) International Journal of Applied Information Systems (IJAIS), 4 (3), pp. 7-12; Sinaga, A., Adiwijaya, N.H., Development of word-based text compression algorithm for Indonesian language document (2015) 3rd International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICOICT), pp. 450-454; Willett, P., The Porter stemming algorithm: Then and now (2006) Emerald Insight, 40 (3), pp. 219-223; (2008) Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia, , 4th ed., Departemen Pendidikan Nasional; Adriani, M., Asian, J., Nazief, B., Stemming Indonesian: A confix-stripping approach (2007) ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing, 6, pp. 1-33; Asian, J., Williams, H., Tahaghoghi, S., Stemming Indonesian (2005) Conferences in Research and Practice in Information Technology Series, 38, pp. 307-314; Arifin, A.Z., Mahendra, I.P.A.K., Ciptaningtyas, H.T., Enhanced confix stripping stemmer and ants algorithm for classifying news document in Indonesian language (2009) International Conference on Information & Communication Technology and Systems, pp. 149-158; Frakes, W.B., Fox, C.J., Strength and similarity of affix removal stemming algorithms (2003) ACM SIGIR Forum, 37, pp. 26-30; Waridah, E., (2015) EYD Ejaan Yang Disempurnakan & Seputar Kebahasa-Indonesiaan, , Ruang kata; Alwi, H., Dardjowidjojo, S., Lapoliwa, H., Moeliono, A.M., (2003) Tata Bahasa Baku Bahasa Indonesia, , 3rd ed., Balai Pustaka",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","13th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology, ECTI-CON 2016","28 June 2016 through 1 July 2016",,123682,,9781467397490,,,"English","Int.

By using this technology, Learning Management System (LMS) can provide an unimpeded interaction for their users and promote awareness for any information updates. It is crucial to develop mobile application for each major mobile platform to reach most of the LMS user. In this paper, the mobile application development was done by combining native mobile technology and web technology using WebView API. This approach was taken to anticipate the need for creating and maintaining the application on multiple mobile platform and was expected to cut development time frame while retaining consistent interface and still enable platform specific's feature usage. The purpose of this study is to review the strengths and weaknesses of such combination in mobile application development specifically under android platform. © 2015 The Authors.

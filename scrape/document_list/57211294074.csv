If marketing performance is good, then the company will also develop well. But in today's conditions, we often find that marketing motivation is often overlooked or not too cared for. So that performance decreases and will be very detrimental to the company. However, marketing motivation needs to be improved by determining the top marketers through a bonus system. Where the use of data warehouse will be carried out as the best Decision Support System (DSS) for manager in determining the top marketers. With the use of data warehouses, large amounts of data can be prayed in such a way as to produce information that is useful for managers in decision making. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

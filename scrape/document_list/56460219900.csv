The method is also applicable for determining thickness of concrete mattress required to withstand a certain height of waves. However, the method cannot predict deformation of concrete mattress subjected to repetitive wave loads. This paper elaborates the modeling of concrete mattress against the dynamic loading of waves by means of Finite Element Method (Plaxis 2D). It is found that the conventional method is adequate in determining thickness of concrete mattress required against wave height with a factor of safety against lift off in the order of 3.5. The movement of the concrete mattress can be assessed by simulating the wave loads as a concentrated sinusoidal dynamic load at the point of wave impact. © Research India Publications.","Concentrated sinusoidal dynamic load; Concrete mattress; Plaxis 2D; Shore protection",,,,,,"Pilarczyk, K.W., (1998) Dikes and Revetments, , A.A Balkema, Rotterdam; Pilarczyk, K.W., (2003) Design of Revetments, Dutch Public Works Department (RWS), , Hydraulic Engineering Division, Delft, The Netherlands; Breteler, M.K., Pilarczyk, K.W., Stoutjesdijk, T., (1998) Design of Alternative Revetments, , Delft, The Netherlands","Gunawan, A.; Civil Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and TechnologyHong Kong",,,"Research India Publications",,,,,09734562,,,,"English","Int.

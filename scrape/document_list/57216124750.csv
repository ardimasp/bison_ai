This study was conducted with the aim of evaluating and finding out the factors that influencing LAKSA adoption in Tangerang Live application. The effect on LAKSA adoption is explained using perceptions of beliefs, attitudes, and intentions of use that refer to the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The innovation factor also explains the influence of LAKSA adoption indirectly. Data processing and analysis in this research is using SEM-PLS (Structural Equation Model - Partial Least Square) method. The results of this study indicate that innovation has a positive effect on usability perception and perception of ease of use. The perception of usability and perceived ease of use have a positive effect on user attitudes. User attitude positively affects the intention to use technology. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","E-government; Structural Equation Model - Partial Least Square; Technology Acceptance Model","Data handling; Least squares approximations; Data processing and analysis; E-government services; Intention to use technologies; Partial least square (PLS); Perceived ease of use; Structural equation modeling; Technology acceptance model; User attitudes; e-government",,,,,"Shroff, R.H., Deneen, C.C., Ng, E.M., Analysis of the technology acceptance model in examining students' behavioural intention to use e-portfolio system (2011) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 27 (4), pp. 600-618; Davis, F.B., User Acceptance of Computer Technology: A Comparison of Two Theoretical Model (1989) Management Science, 35, pp. 982-1003; Venkatesh, V., Morris, M., Davis, G., Davis, F., User acceptance of information technology: Toward a unified view (2003) MIS Quarterly, 27 (3), pp. 425-478; Hair, J.F., Hult, G.T., Ringle, C.M., Sarstedt, M., (2014) A Primer on Partial Least Squares Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM)","Madyatmadja, E.D.; Information Systems Department, Indonesia; email: emadyatmadja@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Mobile game application along with the development of mobile phone technology such as a smartphone, tablet, and laptop, can be used to increase the player or user interest to engage with religion thing. Using the mobile game application in mobile gadgets will expand quickly to install and use for religion engagement. The player can learn religion things with fun and entertain ways, where the player does not realize that they do something serious in an unserious way. This paper will explain the model system design for mobile game application for learning Catholicism in fun and entertaining way and for the first development was limited to only three Catholic catechisms such as bible learning, church lesson, and liturgy celebration. For the early development, three types of games were developed such as True or False game, Scramble words game, and multiple-choice game. The mobile game model was designed with a use case diagram, storyboard, and class diagram, where for the current implementation the mobile game application was implemented using a ten tables database. © 2019 IEEE.","Game; Game Information Systems; Mobile game; religion Game; religious Video Game; Serious Game","Class diagrams; Human rights; Mobile games; Mobile phone technology; Model system; Multiple choice; Use case diagram; User interests",,,,,"Warnars, H.L.H.S., Game information system (2008) Proceedings of CGAMES 2008-12th International Conference on Computer Games: AI, , Animation, Mobile, Educational and Serious Games, Louisville, Kentucky, USA, 30 July-2 Agt 2008; Warnars, H.L.H.S., Game information system (2010) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology (IJCSIT), 2 (3), pp. 135-148. , June; Suryapranta, L.K.P., Gaol, F.L., Soewito, B., Warnars, H.L.H.S., Kusuma, G.P., Quality measurement for serious game (2017) IEEE International Conference on Applied Computer and Communication Technologies, , IEEE ComCom 2017), Jakarta, Indonesia, 17-18 May; Junaidi, J., Julianto, A., Anwar, N., Safrizal, S., Warnars, H.L.H.S., Hashimoto, K., Perfecting a video game with game metrics (2018) Telkomnika, 16 (3), pp. 1324-1331. , June; Warnars, H.L.H.S., Virtual information system on working area (2008) Indonesian Students' International Scientific Meeting, pp. 169-181; Bahana, R., Gaol, F.L., Wiguna, T., Hendric, S., Soewito, B., Nugroho, E., Dirgantoro, B.P., Abdurachman, E., Performance test for prototype game for children with ADHD (2018) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 978 (1). , March; Pranoto, H., Genaldi, E., Anthony, R., Kurnia, A., Warnars, H.L.H.S., Trisetyarso, A., B.

Besides widely known as a form of entertainment, some messages or lessons can be learned from a video game that may affect the players. Conscious or unconscious, games have influenced many sectors of life, and it has been recognized as a serious game and no exception to religion. Human as a living creature, like or dislike or even as an atheist should believe with something out there, and religion is as a medium which connects human with something out there. The game as a representation of entertaining, intelligent application will represent joy and happiness in human life's activities, and inevitably games will influence human religion. In the end, religion game will help the human to increase their faith in those their belief based on their religion. Similar to Information Technology which is implemented in business to increase revenue, the game as an entertaining intelligent application will increase human's faith. One kind of video game that provides it is religion video games which are the result of the incorporation between religion and video games. In this paper, we do a literature review about religion video games.

We also try to summarize the positive side and controversies in religion video games. © 2019 IEEE.","Game; Game elements; religion Game; religious Video Game; Serious Game; Video game","Entertainment;

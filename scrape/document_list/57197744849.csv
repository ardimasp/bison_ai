The cultural gamification prototype for this study is developed using Virtual Reality technology on Google Cardboard in which some elements of Indonesian culture is used in part of the game story. Dataset for the game evaluation is collected using survey method. Data collection is implemented using self-administered questionnaire which is developed based on GameFlow framework. The respondent population is the college students who like to play games. The survey samples are chosen using purposive sampling technique. The results of this study indicate that there is a strong association of playing frequency and personality traits to game user experiences. Also, there is a weak association between gender and age to game user experiences. These research findings are valuable for game designer to design enjoyable and educational games. © 2016 IEEE.","Cultural Gamification; GameFlow; User Experience Evaluation","Students; Virtual reality; Educational game; Gameflow; Gamification; Personality traits; Sampling technique; Self-administered questionnaire; User experience evaluations; Virtual reality technology; Surveys; Design; Evaluation",,,,,"Abt, C.C., (1987) Serious Games, , University Press of America; Zyda, M., From visual simulation to virtual reality to games (2005) Computer, 38 (9), pp. 25-32; (2016) Encyclopedia Britannica, , http://www.britannica.com, September 14; Zichermann, G., Cunningham, C., (2011) Gamification by Design: Implementing Game Mechanics in Web and Mobile Apps, , O'Reilly Media, Inc; Martí-Parreño, J., Méndez-Ibáñez, E., Alonso-Arroyo, A., The use of gamification in education: A bibliometric and text mining analysis (2016) Journal of Computer Assisted Learning; Matsumoto, T., Motivation Strategy Using Gamification (2016) Creative Education, 7 (10), p. 1480; Van der Graaf, J., Segers, E., Verhoeven, L., Discovering the laws of physics with a serious game in kindergarten (2016) Computers & Education, 101, pp. 168-178; Sipiyaruk, K., Hatzipanagos, S., Gallagher, J.E., Reynolds, P.A., Knowledge Improvement of Dental Students in Thailand and UK Through an Online Serious Game in Dental Public Health (2016) Serious Games, Interaction, and Simulation, pp. 80-85. , Springer International Publishing; Wang, R., DeMaria, S., Jr., Goldberg, A., Katz, D., A Systematic Review of Serious Games in Training Health Care Professionals (2016) Simulation in Healthcare, 11 (1), pp. 41-51; Baranowski, T., Blumberg, F., Buday, R., DeSmet, A., Fiellin, L.E., Green, C.S., Kato, P.M., Morrill, B.A., Games for health for children-Current status and needed research (2016) Games for Health Journal, 5 (1), pp. 1-12; Zaharias, P., Pappas, C., Quality Management of Learning Management Systems: A User Experience Perspective (2016) Current Issues in Emerging ELearning, 3 (1), p. 5; Schoech, D., Boyas, J.F., Black, B.M., Elias-Lambert, N., Gamification for Behavior Change: Lessons from Developing a Social, Multiuser, Web-Tablet Based Prevention Game for Youths (2013) Journal of Technology in Human Services, 31 (3), pp. 197-217; Hassenzahl, M., Tractinsky, N., User experience - A research agenda (2006) Behaviour & Information Technology, 25 (2), pp. 91-97; Adams, E., (2014) Fundamentals of Game Design, , Pearson Education Inc; Sweetser, P., Wyeth, P., GameFlow: A model for evaluating player enjoyment in games (2005) Computers in Entertainment (CIE), 3 (3), p. 3; Csikszentmihalyi, M., (1990) Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, , Harper Perennial, New York; Pachet, F., Addressi, A.R., Music: When children reflect on their own playing style: Experiments with continuator and children (2004) Computers in Entertainment, 2 (1), p. 14; Artz, J., Computers and the quality of life: Assessing flow in information systems (1996) Computers and Society, 26 (3), pp. 7-12; Jegers, K., Pervasive game flow: Understanding player enjoyment in pervasive gaming (2007) Computers in Entertainment (CIE), 5 (1), p. 9; Fu, F., Su, R.-C., Yu, S.-C., EGameFlow: A scale to measure learners' enjoyment of e-learning games (2009) Computers & Education, 52 (1), pp. 101-112; Haddad, N.A., Heritage multimedia and children edutainment: Assessment and recommendations (2014) Advances in Multimedia 2014, p. 4; Valtolina, S., Franzoni, S., Mazzoleni, P., Bertino, E., Dissemination of cultural heritage content through virtual reality and multimedia techniques: A case study (2005) Proceeding of 11th IEEE International Multimedia Modelling Conference, pp. 214-221; Calvillo-Gámez, E.H., Cairns, P., Cox, A.L., (2015) Assessing the Core Elements of the Gaming Experience, Game User Experience Evaluation, pp. 37-62. , Springer International Publishing; Loton, D.J., (2007) Problem Video Game Playing, Self Esteem and Social Skills: An Online Study, , PhD diss., Victoria University",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1st International Conference on Game, Game Art, and Gamification, ICGGAG 2016","19 December 2016 through 21 December 2016",,130961,,9781509054794,,,"English","Int.

In this case various development fields are targeted by the central government which is carried out by the regional government up to the level of government at the village level. The development is to help the community in many sectors, especially for the poor. Many attempts have been conducted by government; however, the results are not optimal and not meeting the right target. This study has the intention to provide a decision support application for village level government based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which aims to facilitate development decision making in the region. This application is designed with a GIS approach, observation, discussion, literature studies and analyzing system with UML are conducted in this research. The result is dashboard of business intelligence based on GIS expected to be able to provide data support both geographically and tabularly so that program implementation is more targeted. © 2020 IEEE.","Business intelligence; GIS; Poor citizens; Poverty reduction; Welfare program","Decision making; Decision support systems; Information analysis; Information management; Rural areas; Analyzing system; Central government; Data support; Decision support applications; Design and implementations; Literature studies; Program implementation; Regional government; Geographic information systems",,,,"Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Tinggi, DIKTI: 12/AKM/PNT/2019, 039/VR, RTT/IV/2019","This research was supported by Indonesian Higher Education (DIKTI), Research Contract Number: 12/AKM/PNT/2019, 039/VR.RTT/IV/2019.

However, commonly this extraction task is still done by human experts manually, so the process is very expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, semantic segmentation is the process of classifying each pixel of an image as a class label to understand the image at a pixel level. This paper proposed an algorithm of semantic segmentation based on deep learning, namely Segmentation Networks (SatNet), for automatically segmenting buildings and roads. Our SatNet model is based on Residual Networks (ResNet) for image feature extraction. Finally, we compared the proposed algorithm to the state-of-the-art and our segmentation results have improved significantly.

The presence of someone in an organization is a sign that the person is carrying out their obligations to come to the agency or organization. Usually, attendance is done manually. It can be signed or called one by one. In this digital age, there must be a change from this absence to be able to accelerate and provide time efficiency. We can use face recognition to record attendance from everyone present in an organization. In this face recognition, many algorithms are performed to dissect and capture images of someone’s face, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning. With this algorithm, the system can recognize a person’s face and record attendance from that person so that attendance activities are more efficient and faster. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Attendance management; Attendance system; Face capturing; Face recognition; Machine Learning","Computational methods; Deep learning; Intelligent systems; Software engineering; Attendance systems; Capture images; Digital age; Time efficiencies; Face recognition",,,,,,"Agrawal, S., Khatri, P., Facial expression detection techniques: Based on Viola and Jones algorithm and principal component analysis (2015) 2015 Fifth International Conference on Advanced Computing & Communication Technologies, Pp. 108–112.

This program is planned, implemented, directed and supervised by the government so that the program's objectives are in line with the targets, namely poverty reduction. Many efforts have been made but the impact of this program has not been optimal, one of the reasons is the unavailability of object target data for these programs that state who the poor are and where they live for the basis of program intervention so that implementation is not on target as well as the realization report. The purpose of this paper is to design a Business Intelligence (BI) application that is able to provide such data so that program interventions are in line with the objectives. Development methodology is designed using Geographical Information System (GIS) approach yang which consists of stages of data acquisition (spatial and tabular data) at various levels of administration, geodatabase design and WebGIS applications as well as spatial analysis.

According to World Bank data, Indonesia is the country with the largest economic development in Southeast Asia. Unfortunately, the threat of terrorism in Indonesia is very large, therefore it requires a smart system such as military robots. Today's vision-based robot technology has also been used in the development of autonomous military robots. A sophisticated military robot is a robot that is needed by the military/police because it can be deployed to the battlefield or the eradication of terrorism in a remote or autonomous manner. This system is needed to reduce the remaining casualties from the army, and this combat robot system can also be operated at any time with more numbers than regular soldiers and with minimal operator needs. In this paper, we propose a prototype of a tank-based military robot with object detection and tracking and turrets for simulation of shooting the enemy target based on the computer vision. The object tracker will detect an upper body of the target using a library in OpenCV and the tank will track until it reaches the best position to shoot the target. The methods explained, and experimental results were presented. © 2019 IEEE.","computer vision; military robot; object detction; object tracker; turret","Economics; Intelligent robots; Object detection; Tanks (containers); Target tracking; Terrorism; Economic development; Military robots; Object detction; Object detection and tracking; object tracker; Robot technology; Southeast Asia; turret; Computer vision",,,,"Binus University

To support this concept, we designed an artificial neural network (ANN) using backpropagation, stochastic learning, and steepest gradient descent algorithms to determine teacher engagement based on the Indonesian Teacher Engagement Index (ITEI). The resulting ANN may be used in a data-gathering website for teachers to use for self-evaluation and self-intervention. The optimal architecture for the ANN has 44 input nodes, 26 first hidden layer nodes, 20 second hidden layer nodes, and 7 output nodes, with a learning rate of 0.05 and trained over 5000 iterations. The sample data used for training was gathered by ITEI researchers and the Executive Board of Indonesian Teachers Association (Pengurus Besar Persatuan Guru Republik Indonesia, PB-PGRI) and includes data of teachers from all around Indonesia. The maximum accuracy of this ANN was 97.98%. The sample data were then used to create an executive information system presented in the form of a map created using ArcGIS Pro software. © 2019 The Authors.

The challenging part of food image recognition is to recognize a food image with different background, intensity, and perspective. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) seems to be the right choice to build a powerful model that able to recognize food image accurately. Current researches in food recognition use American fast food and Japanese food as the dataset. Different dataset has different treatment to obtain good result. Color and presentation has important role as features. Therefore, this research proposes to recognize five kinds of popular Indonesian food such as meatball (bakso), grilled chicken (ayam bakar), satay (sate), gado-gado (mixed vegetables with peanut sauce), and rendang using Convolutional Neural Network approach. Convolutional Neural Network with standard architecture and inception-v4 model are chosen as techniques with Adam as the optimizer function. Experimental results show the implementation of CNN for image recognition can achieve the top-1 testing accuracy around 76.3% for standard network and 95.2% for inception-v4 network. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,"Convolution; Neural networks; Convolutional neural network; Different treatments; Food image; Health industry; Japanese foods; Optimizers; Standard architecture; Testing accuracy; Image recognition",,,,"Binus University","The authors thank to Bina Nusantara University for the research grant and supporting this research.","Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L., ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database (2009) IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2009, pp. 248-255; Hinton, G.E., Srivastava, N., Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Salakhutdinov, R.R., (2012) Improving Neural Networks by Preventing Co-Adaptation of Feature Detectors, , arXiv preprint arXiv; Ioffe, S., Szegedy, C., (2015) Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift, , arXiv preprint arXiv; Kagaya, H., Aizawa, K., Ogawa, M., Food detection and recognition using convolutional neural network (2014) Proceedings of the 22Nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 1085-1088. , pp., ACM; Kawano, Y., Yanai, K., Real-time mobile food recognition system (2013) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pp. 1-7. , pp; Kingma, D.P., Ba, J., (2014) Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization, , arXiv preprint arXiv; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1097-1105. , pp; Lecun, Y., Boser, B.E., Denker, J.S., Henderson, D., Howard, R.E., Hubbard, W.E., Jackel, L.D., Handwritten digit recognition with a back-propagation network (1990) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 396-404. , pp; Nair, V., Hinton, G.E., Rectified linear units improve restricted boltzmann machines (2010) In: Proceedings of the 27Th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML; Pan, S.J., Yang, Q., A survey on transfer learning (2010) IEEE Trans.

The prediction information about PGA is important to minimize the effect of earthquake. The method for prediction is Ordinary Kriging. It is geostatistic method used to predict data in certain locations which have autocorrelation. The sample data used in this research are PGA in Meuraxa, Banda Aceh 2006. The steps of research methodology consist of autocorrelations identify by Moran’s I and LISA, build semivariograms, and prediction by Ordinary Kriging. The results is Ordinary Kriging can be applied to predict PGA. It was shown by evaluate of mean and MSE value. According to mean value of three prediction, all models (Gaussian, Spherical, and Exponential) have mean 0,3534; 0,3584; and 0,3555 which approaches the actual PGA mean 0.34. According to MSE value, it can be seen that all models have small MSE or relatively closed to zero. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",,"Autocorrelation; Computational methods; Earthquakes; Geophysics; Interpolation; Earthquake acceleration; Geostatistic; Ordinary kriging; Peak ground acceleration; Prediction informations; Research methodologies; Semivariograms; Spatial autocorrelations; Forecasting",,,,,,"http://www.bmkg.go.id/RBMKG Wilayah 10/Geofisika/gempabumi.bmkg, Accessed: 12 Dec 2012; Irwansyah, E., Winarko, E., Rasjid, Z., Bekti, R., Earthquake hazard zonation using peak ground acceleration (Pga) approach (2013) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 423. , IOP Publishing, 012067; Megawati, K., Pan, T.C., Ground-motion attenuation relationship for the sumatran megathrust earthquakes (2010) Earthq.

Given that it takes a good model for predicting the strength of earthquakes in order to reduce the risk of the impact of natural disasters. Two major contributions of this study are ground motion attenuation model specific to the subduction zone that has been optimized with the Levenberg-Marquard method and Bruce-Force uses a model Youngs et al. [1] and a proof that the Levenberg-Marquard method for optimization model is better than Bruce-Force method. The Levenberg-Marquardt method has been proven to provide more accurate results on the modeling of ground motion attenuation which is indicated by a very small deviation between the values of PGA predictable results with the PGA actual values. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",,"Computational methods; Disasters; Geophysics; Optimization; Earthquake ground motions; Force method; Ground-motion attenuations; Levenberg-Marquardt; Levenberg-Marquardt method; Natural disasters; Optimization modeling; Subduction zones; Earthquakes",,,,,"Acknowledgments.

The assessment model on earthquake damage with a fuzzy system has previously developed. It was aimed to assess the building damage rate after earthquake events, and it has a particular weakness on both the criteria used and the rate of model accuracy. The study was conducted to develop fuzzy inference model to determine the building damage hazard, especially for non-engineered building houses on a particular earthquake event (mitigation). The model was is a threestage fuzzy rule-based model using a thousand data of building houses damaged as result of the impact of earthquake in Bener Meriah district, Aceh Province, Indonesia in the 2013 event, the peak ground acceleration (PGA) data, slope data extracted from 30 meters digital elevation model (DEM) and distance from major fault that was extracted from geological structure map. The main contribution of the research that has been done is to develop the function and fuzzy membership for each determinant variable of building house damage hazard and three stage fuzzy inference process to determine the building house damage hazard as an impact of an earthquake event. Using four hundred data of building houses damage as an impact of the earthquake at the same location, a three-stage fuzzy rule-based model that has been implemented in the study was proven to be able to determine the level of damaged building houses especially for nonengineered building houses better than the previous models with model performance by 93%.","Damage hazard; Earthquake; Non-engineered building; Three stage fuzzy rule-based","Buildings; Damage detection; Earthquakes; Fuzzy rules; Geophysics; Hazards; Houses; Surveying; Digital elevation model; Earthquake intensity; Fuzzy inference model; Fuzzy rule based; Fuzzy rule-based models; Geological structures; Non-engineered buildings; Peak ground acceleration; Fuzzy inference",,,,,,"(2009) Historic World Earthquakes, , http://earthquake.usgs.gov, United States Geological Survey/USGS, [accessed Jan. 10, 2012]; (2012) Magnitude 8.6 -Off theWest Coast of Northern Sumatra, , http://earthquake.usgs.gov, United States Geological Survey/USGS, [accessed May 13, 2012]; Sanchez-Silva, M., Garcia, L., Earthquake damage assessment based on fuzzy logic and neural networks (2001) Earthquake Spectra, 17 (1), pp. 89-112; Irwansyah, E., Building damage assessment using remote sensing, aerial photograph and gis data; case study in banda aceh after sumatera earthquake 2004 (2010) Proc. of the on Intelligent Technology and Its Application 2010, 33 (1). , Surabaya; Miura, H., Midorikawa, S., Kerle, N., Detection of building damage areas of the 2006 central Java, Indonesia, earthquake through digital analysis of optical satellite images (2013) Earthquake Spectra, 29 (1), pp. 453-473; (2012) West Sumatra Earthquake -One Year On, , http://www.ausaid.gov.au, Australian Agency for International Development-AusAID [accessed Apr. 7, 2012]; (2013) Kerusakan Bangunan Akibat Gempa Dipengaruhi Kondisi Fisik Bangunan dan Lokasi Geologis, , http://www.esdm.go.id/berita/42-geologi/2814-kerusakan-bangunan-Akibat-gempa-dipengaruhikondisi-pisik-bangunan-dan-lokasi-geologis-.html, ESDM-Kementrian Energi dan Sumberdaya Mineral [accessed Apr. 15, 2012]; Şen, Z., Supervised fuzzy logic modeling for building earthquake hazard assessment (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 38 (12), pp. 14564-14573; Crowley, H., Pinho, R., Bommer, J.J., Bird, J.F., (2006) Development of a Displacement-Based Method for Earthquake Loss Assessment, , Report 2006/01; Bernardini, A., Gori, R., Modena, C., An application of coupled analytical models and experiential knowledge for seismic vulnerability analyses of masonry buildings (1990) Omega Scientific; (2003) HAZUS MH MR4: Multi-hazard Loss Estimation Methodology Maintenance Release 4 (MR4)., , http://www.fema.gov, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

Medical image data is formed by pixels that correspond to a part of a physical object and produced by imaging modalities. Exploration of medical image data methods is a challenge in the sense of getting their insight value, analyzing and diagnosing of a specific disease. Image classification plays an important role in computer-aided-diagnosis and is a big challenge on image analysis tasks. This challenge related to the usage of methods and techniques in exploiting image processing result, pattern recognition result and classification methods and subsequently validating the image classification result into medical expert knowledge. The main objective of medical images classification is not only to reach high accuracy but also to identify which parts of human body are infected by the disease. This paper reviewed the state-of-the-art of image classification techniques to diagnose human body disease. The review covered identification of medical image classification techniques, image modalities used, the dataset and trade off for each technique. At the end, the reviews showed the improvement of image classification techniques such as to increase accuracy and sensitivity value and to be feasible employed for computer-aided-diagnosis are a big challenge and an open research. © 2016 IEEE.","disease diagnosis; image classification; medical informatics","Classification (of information); Computer aided analysis; Computer aided diagnosis; Diagnosis; Economic and social effects; Image analysis; Image processing; Information management; Medical imaging; Pattern recognition; Classification methods; Classification results; Classification technique; Disease diagnosis; Images classification; Medical informatics; Sensitivity values; State of the art; Image classification",,,,,,"Procter, R., (2016) Definition of Health Informatics, , https//www.nlm.nih.gov/hsrinfo/informatics.html, Aug. 01,[Aug. 03, 2016]; Bui, A.A.T., Taira, R.K., Kangarloo, H., Introduction (2010) Medical Imaging Informatics, pp. 3-14. , New York: Springer; Roque, F.S., Jensen, P.B., Schmock, H., Dalgaard, M., Andreatta, M., Hansen, T., Søeby, K., Jensen, L.J., Using electronic patient records to discover disease correlations and stratify patient cohorts (2011) PLOS Computational Technology, 7 (8), pp. 1-10; Qiu, Y., Zhen, S., Zhou, M., Li, L., Continuously improve the medical care quality and hospital management level through medical information system construction (2012) Journal of Translational Medicine, 10, p.

Therefore this study aims to proposed an offline signature recognition and verification system which employed an efficient fuzzy Kohonen clustering networks (EFKCN)1 algorithm. The proposed recognition system and signature verification system consist of five stages including data acquisition, image processing, data normalization, clustering, and evaluation. The recognition of signature patterns using the clustering method with the EFKCN algorithm shows relatively better result with 70% accuracy compared to the accuracy of previous research results2 which is 53%, and a good signature recognition result can be developed to assist the verification system as well as the personal data verification system as made in this study. © 2017 The Authors.

As a contribution to support prevention of this phenomenon, this paper proposes a mining model using a naïve Bayes classifier that could detect cardiovascular disease and identify its risk level for adults. Methods: The process of designing the method began by identifying the knowledge related to the cardiovascular disease profile and the level of cardiovascular disease risk factors for adults based on the medical record, and designing a mining technique model using a naïve Bayes classifier. Evaluation of this research employed two methods: accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity calculation as well as an evaluation session with cardiologists and internists. The characteristics of cardiovascular disease are identified by its primary risk factors. Those factors are diabetes mellitus, the level of lipids in the blood, coronary artery function, and kidney function. Class labels were assigned according to the values of these factors: risk level 1, risk level 2 and risk level 3. Results: The evaluation of the classifier performance (accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) in this research showed that the proposed model predicted the class label of tuples correctly (above 80%). More than eighty percent of respondents (including cardiologists and internists) who participated in the evaluation session agree till strongly agreed that this research followed medical procedures and that the result can support medical analysis related to cardiovascular disease. Conclusions: The research showed that the proposed model achieves good performance for risk level detection of cardiovascular disease. © 2016 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.","Bayes Theorem; Cardiovascular Diagnostic Techniques; Cardiovascular Diseases; Classification; Data Mining",,,,,,,"Shouman, M., Turner, T., Stocker, R., Using data mining techniques in heart disease diagnosis and treatment.

This modeling is particularly important in the case of ground motion given that it takes a good model for predicting the strength of earthquakes in order to reduce the risk of the impact of the natural disaster. There are two main contributions of this research is the optimization of ground motion attenuation models with Levenberg-Marquardt method on two models that have been extensively used and the development of computer applications to help accelerate modeling, especially on large data with an area of extensive research.

It is estimated that the preva- lence will increase 55% in 20351. As a form of our efforts to contribute to the prevention of this phenomenon we propose an application of computational intelligence by using fuzzy hierarchical model that has the ability to perform early detection against DM. In order to achieve the success of our propose method, we cooperate with one of the eastern Jakarta hospital laboratory in Indonesia as a facilitator of the data that we need during research and conducting interviews with two medical doctors at the same hospital as a form of knowledge acquisition process. The architecture of our proposed method is designed based on how a medical doctor concluded related to indication that someone has the potential against DM, which is the model has been adjusted with the data we have obtained from the authorities in the laboratory. As a form of evaluation that we do, we did a comparison of the data we have obtained from our method with the medical doctor decision which is equipped with the data from laboratory, and the result is 87.46% of the 311 relevant data is equal to medical doctor's statement. In interpreting the conclusions that we get with the hospitals that cooperate with us, the results showed that the method we propose has meet the needs of the effectiveness and efficiency in performing early detection against DM and can help people in knowing the potential of DM since early. © 2015 The Authors.

The purpose of this research is to compare individual spatial patterns for building damage hazard data due to earthquake in the form of lithology data, topography zone and peak ground acceleration data (PGA). The research methodology consists of a series of data converstion from ordinal to interval data, creation of spatial weighting matrix of rook and queen, the determination of spatial autocorrelation using local indicator of spatial association (LISA) and hostspot analysis usingGetis-OrdGi* statistics and the mapping of spatial patterns.The research concluded that the individual spatial pattern as a result of categorizing data with high significance from the analyzed variable using LISA test and hotspot analysis is determined by variable types and weighted spatial matrix.The test using spatial weighting matrix rook shows that the three variables which is being analyzed, is much better spatially autocorrelated which is denoted by the high value of Moran’s I and the significance pattern on LISA and Z-score for a homogeneous standard deviation on the hotspot analysis. © Research India Publications.","Building damage; Earthquake; Spatial autocorrelation; Spatial pattern",,,,,,,"Irwansyah, E., (2010) Earthquake building damage assessment using aerial photograph and GIS data, , In SITIA conference; Miura, H., Wijeyewickrema, A.C., Inoue, S., Evaluation of tsunami damage in the eastern part of Sri Lanka due to the 2004 Sumatra earthquake using high-resolution satellite images (2005) In Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Remote Sensing for Post-Disaster Response, pp. 12-13; (2012), http://www.ausaid.gov.au/HotTopics/Pages/Display.aspx?QID=471, West Sumatra Earthquake - One Year On.

Each parameter in this model is calculated at each point geographical location. The significantly parameter can be used for mapping. In this research GWR model use for mapping Information and Communication Technology (ICT) indicators which influence on illiteracy. This problem was solved by estimation GWR model. The process was developing optimum bandwidth, weighted by kernel bisquare and parameter estimation. Mapping of ICT indicators was done by P-value. This research use data 29 regencies and 9 cities in East Java Province, Indonesia. GWR model compute the variables that significantly affect on illiteracy (a = 5%) in some locations, such as percent households members with a mobile phone (x2), percent of household members who have computer (x3) and the percent of households who access the internet at school in the last month (x4). Ownership of mobile phone was significant (a = 5%) at 20 locations. Ownership of computer and internet access were significant at 3 locations. Coefficient determination at all locations has R2 between 73.05-92.75%. The factors which affecting illiteracy in each location was very diverse. Mapping by P-value or critical area shows that ownership of mobile phone significantly affected at southern part of East Java. Then, the ownership of computer and internet access were significantly affected on illiteracy at northern area. All the coefficient regression in these locations was negative. It performs that if the number of mobile phone ownership, computer ownership and internet access were high then illiteracy will be decrease. © 2014 Science Publications.","Geographically weighted regression; ICT indicators; Illiteracy; Mapping",,,,,,,"Anselin, L., Rey, S.J., Perspectives on Spatial Data Analysis (2010), p. 290. , 1st Edn., Springer, Berlin, ISBN-10: 642019757; Anselin, L., Spatial Econometrics: Methods and Models (1988), p. 304. , Ist Edn., Kluwer Academic Publishers, Netherlands, ISBN-10: 9024737354; Anselin, L., Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) (1995) Geograph.

PGA is calculated using attenuation function that describes the correlation between the local ground movement intensity the earthquake magnitude and the distance from the earthquake's epicentre. The data used comes from the earthquake damage catalogue available from the Indonesia meteorology, climatology and geophysics agency (BMKG) with range from year 1973-2011. The research methodology consists of six steps, which is developing the grid, calculation of the distance from the epicentre to the centroid of the grid, calculation of PGA values, developing the computer application, plotting the PGA values to the centroid grid, and developing the earthquake hazard zones using kriging algorithm. The conclusion of this research is that the global attenuation function that was developed by [20] can be applied to calculate the PGA values in the city of Banda Aceh. Banda Aceh city in micro scale can be divided into three hazard zones which is low hazard zone with PGA value of 0.8767 gals up to 0.8780 gals, medium hazard zone with PGA values of 0.8781 up to 0.8793 gals and high hazard zone with PGA values of 0.8794 up to 0.8806 gals. © IOP Publishing Ltd 2013.",,"Geophysics; Hazards; Safety engineering; Attenuation function; Earthquake damages; Earthquake hazard; Earthquake magnitudes; Kriging algorithm; Peak ground acceleration; Research methodologies; Seismic hazards; Earthquakes",,,,,,"Atkinson, G.M., Boore, D.M., Empirical ground-motion relations for subduction-zone earthquakes and their application to Cascadia and other regions (2003) Society, 93 (4), pp. 1703-1729; (2002) (In Bahasa) Standar Nasional Indonesia-Tata Cara Perencanaan Ketahanan Gempa Untuk Bangunan Gedung, , Badan Standarisasi Nasional; Balendra, T., Li, Z., Seismic Hazard of Singapore and Malaysia (2008) Earthquake, pp. 57-63. , 1000-3274; Campbell, K.W., Prediction of Strong Ground Motion Using the Hybrid Empirical Method and Its Use in the Development of Ground-Motion (Attenuation) Relations in Eastern North America (2003) Society, 93 (3), pp. 1012-1033; (2005), Indonesia State Ministry for National Planning Development Agency/BAPPENAS; Gregor, N.J., Silva, W.J., Wong, I.G., Youngs, R.R., Ground-Motion Attenuation Relationships for Cascadia Subduction Zone Megathrust Earthquakes Based on a Stochastic Finite-Fault Model (2002) Society, 92 (5), pp. 1923-1932; Irsyam, M., Dangkua, D.T., Hendriyawan, Hoedajanto, D., Hutapeabm, Kertapati, E.K., Boen, T., Petersen, M.D., Proposed seismic hazard maps of Sumatra and Java islands and microzonation study of Jakarta city Indonesia (2008) Earth System Sci., pp. 865-878; Irwansyah, E., (2010) Building Damage Assessment Using Remote Sensing, Aerial Photograph and GIS Data: Case Study in Banda Aceh after Sumatera Earthquake 2004, 11, p. 57; Kramer, S.L., (1996) Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering.; Lin, P.-S., Lee, C.-T., Ground-Motion Attenuation Relationships for Subduction-Zone Earthquakes in Northeastern Taiwan (2008) Bulletin of the Seismological Society America, 98 (1), pp. 220-240. , 10.1785/0120060002 0037-1106; Miura, H., Wijeyewickrema, A., Inoue, S., (2006) Evaluation of Tsunami Damage in the Eastern Part of Sri Lanka Due to the 2004 Sumatra Earthquake Using High-Resolution Satellite Images, , http://ares.tu.chiba-u.jp/workshop/ChibaRS2005/Paper_Miura.pdf, [Sep.13, 2005]; Megawati, K., Pan, T.C., Koketsu, K., Response spectral attenuation relationships for Sumatran-subduction earthquakes and the seismic hazard implications to Singapore and Kuala Lumpur (2005) Soil Dynamics Earthquake Eng., 25 (1), pp. 11-25. , 10.1016/j.soildyn.2004.08.003 0267-7261; Megawati, K., Pan, T.-C., Ground-motion attenuation relationship for the Sumatran megathrust earthquakes (2010) Earthquake., 827-845. , 1000-3274; Fischer, M.M., Getis, A., (2010) Handbook of Applied Spatial Analysis: Software Tools, Method, and Applications, , 10.1007/978-3-642-03647-7; Petersen, M.D., Dewey, J., Hartzell, S., Mueller, C., Harmsen, S., Frankel, A.D., Rukstales, K., Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis for Sumatra, Indonesia and across the Southern Malaysian Peninsula (2004) Tectonophysics, 390 (1-4), pp. 141-158. , 10.1016/j.tecto.2004.03.026 0040-1951; Sengara, I.W., (2008) Seismic Hazard and Microzonation for A District in Banda Aceh City Post 2004 Great Sumatra Earthquake; (2009) Historic World Earthquakes, , http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/historical_country. php#indonesia, USGS, [November 23th, 2009]; (2012) Magnitude 8.6-Off The West Coast Of Northern Sumatra, , http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/usc000905e.php, USGS, [May 13th, 2012]; Villaverde, R., (2009) Fundamental Concepts of Earthquake Engineering; Youngs, (1997)",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","2013 International Conference on Science and Engineering in Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics, ScieTech 2013","24 January 2013 through 25 January 2013","Jakarta",96723,17426588,,,,"English","J.

This kind of business offers a low limited loan amount for customer needs. The online loan business only verifies the current data of each customer for the user profiling process. Due to insufficient profile data of customers in person, the limit cannot go higher than it is now. But this business has the potential to grow and provide a better-customized loan amount according to each customer's financial conditions. The lack of customer data profile can be solved by integrating the data and loan system with big data. Big data offers a way to give online loan business a more accurate profiling system to track the customer financial history and many more. By having sufficient data of potential customers, the online loan companies can provide higher loan amounts to the customers based on their financial track. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Demands by demands then addressed to their children to get higher and higher score in every subjects. However, parents and teachers are often forgot about one thing, besides of just demanding the children to get high scores, they also responsible in providing the best conditions to boost the children's potential and performance. To help solving this issue, the author used data mining model in binary classification approach. Data mining methods that author chose was decision tree due to its high accuracy comparing to the neural network and support vector machine that have lower accuracy than decision tree. Despite of previous result that is the main factor that affects student performance, in this research, we also found several factors of environments that may affects the student performance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Classification (of information); Decision trees; Students; Teaching; Trees (mathematics); Academic achievements; Binary Classification Approach; Data mining methods; Data mining models; High-accuracy; Society environment; Student performance; Data mining",,,,,"Adiyarta, K., Napitupulu, D., Rahim, R., Abdullah, D., Setiawan, M., Analysis of e-learning implementation readiness based on integrated elr model (2018) J.

This article is valuable to extend the comprehension and knowledge of SME’s entrepreneurship to obtain innovation performance through digital business strategies and these efforts are encouraged by effectuation decision-making logic. This survey targets the manufacturing of small and medium-scale food and beverage SMEs in Indonesia. A total of 52 SME entrepreneurs were selected as the respondent in this research. The data obtained from the collecting of the online questionnaires were analyzed using Moderating Regression Analysis with SPSS for data analysis. The successful entrepreneurial SMEs enhance their innovation performance by improving managerial-operational capability. Effectuation decision-making logic contributes more to strengthening the relationship between managerial capability with innovation performance than operational capability with innovation performance. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Effectuation; Innovation Performance; Managerial Capability; Operational Capability",,,,,,,"Agostini, L., Nosella, A., Filippini, R., Towards an integrated view of the ambidextrous organization: A second-order factor model (2016) Creativity and Innovation Management, 25 (1), pp. 129-141; Agostini, L., Nosella, A., Filippini, R., Does intellectual capital allow improving innovation performance?

The results of the study prove that the six risk factors perceived by consumers in shopping online have a negative and significant impact on consumer purchase intentions. Among the factors studied, time/psychological risk factors are the main contributors to consumers in considering making an online purchase. © 2020 IEEE.","E-commerce; Online consumer behavior; Online purchase intention; Online purchasing","Electronic commerce; Information management; Linear regression; Sales; Surveys; Consumer purchase; Multiple linear regressions; Online surveys; Online transaction; Perceived risk; Purchase intention; Risk factors; Purchasing",,,,,,"Doolin, B., Dillon, S., Thompson, F., Corner, J.L., Perceived risk, the internet shopping experience and online purchasing behavior: A New Zealand perspective (2005) J.

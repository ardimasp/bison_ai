Exposure in this paper aims to provide an overview of how socialization of mitigation in dealing with natural disasters carried out by the use of information systems and technology can be successful with reference to the theory of SECI (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, and Internalization), knowledge development with data formed based on the perspective of the community. Factor analysis method is used to look for the success factors of mitigation socialization in the face of natural disasters. Furthermore, from the new factors that are formed, further analysis is carried out with a regression analysis method to develop a successful model of disaster mitigation socialization expected.The results of the study provide a number of new factors that can be represented as variables of community awareness of natural disasters, mitigation socialization processes in the face of natural disasters, availability of systems and information technology, and knowledge management governance on natural disaster mitigation. The conclusion obtained from this study is that the momentum of the industrial revolution era 4.0 can be utilized to support the socialization process of natural disaster mitigation independently measured based on the local wisdom of the local community. © 2020 Author(s).","knowledge management systems; mitigation activities; natural disasters; SECI Model; socialization",,,,,,,"Arya, A., Risk and Vulnerability Profile for Earthquakes and Landslide Hazards' in NIDM-IHC (2005) (2005) Meeting -Ature's Upheavals: A Holistic Look at Disaster Mitigation, pp. 33-49. , India Habitat Center, New Delhi; Nezafati, N., Afrazeh, A., Jalali, D., Mohammad, S., A dynamic model for measuring knowledge level of organizations based on Nonaka and Takeuchi Model (SECI (2009) Scientific Research and Essay., 4, pp. 531-542; Manandhar, B., Remittance and earthquake preparedness (2016) International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 15, pp. 52-60. , March 2016; Ford, A., (2009) Modeling the Environment, p. 380. , Second Edition. 2nd Editio.

This research focuses on the problem to motivate employees to share their knowledge and use KMS. Bina Nusantara University in Indonesia becomes the object of the research since the university has implemented KM Portal system. Furthermore, the university has run the KM Award as the reward system. The research method of this study implements a Point Incentive System on the KM Portal for a year and compares the impact with the previous reward system. The reward system used were 1) KM Award System (2018) and 2) Point Incentive System (2019), each of which has been used for one year. This study focuses on comparing the two systems. The research applies quantitative research methodology to measure the number of user contributors and the number of contents in the system. When the numbers show an increase, then this is regarded as the indicator of success. The results show an increase in the number of user contributors by 34.92% and the number of contents by 68.85% stored on the KM Portal. This shows that the application of the KM Point Incentive System is more successful in promoting employees’ motivation to use KMS. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

In the context of Information Overload, an additional load of information does not always increase benefits to users. In the previous study, a KMS MR framework was designed to address Information Overload. Following that, this research follows through earlier research by experimenting with a case study. The case study involved students working on quizzes that were allowed to open the Internet, open books, and KMS applications with a 30-minute time limit. In this baseline, the research question ushers on the impact of the implementation of the KMS MR framework in the case study and whether to improve the information quality perceived by students. The research method is based on experimental, questionnaires and statistics for processing data and decision making. In addition, this study intends to evince the reliability of the KMS MR framework in overcoming the Information Overload issue. At the end of the study, the results indicated the gap of 1.50 points as the differences in the value of information quality between the two groups of KMS MR and KMS. Per this outcome, the KMS MR framework is capable of improving the information quality and shifting the culmination point of Information Overload. © 2019 ISSN.","Case study; Information overload (IO); KMS MR; Knowledge management system (KMS); MapRe-duce",,,,,,,"Eppler, M.

In this corridor, the growth of digital content in the system seems to have a positive impact on the organization. However, this continued growth is not always beneficial for the organization over time. In this context, the con- dition is renowned as Information Overload (IO) in the system. The research question in the study is to determine the KMS framework to overcome the information overload issue. As this backdrop, the paper provides the KMS framework guidance to overcome IO issues based on the MapReduce approach. In this respect, this study aims to be a useful reference framework for organizations that address IO problems. The method in this study refers to literature studies which collect various references related to KMS and MapReduce algorithm. It directs to the use of in-depth observation to build the frame- work. Ultimately, this study concludes that the production of KMS MapReduce framework has been completed and set prepared for the implementation in a real case.

Due to the phenomenon, many organizations shift their system or storage media with cloud computing. So that formed an architecture where the application system and content storage to be separate and distribute. In advance these two sub-systems are generally integrated into an intranet infrastructure, so there is no problem in communication between the sub-systems. Another thing to note is that the hook information between the people and the content is required. Hence, an architecture to push new content when it is present in the system is needed. Therefore, it takes an architecture that integrates cloud storage with an on-premise KMS system to push new content in the system. The objective of this study is to generate an architecture for an organization that implements KMS and requires push new content system from cloud storage. The method used is using literature study and architecture model development with examples of implementation in cloud Microsoft Azure and KMS Bina Nusantara University. The result of this study is an architecture on KMS that is integrated with cloud storage and supports a new content push notification system. © 2018 IEEE.","architecture push; cloud storage; knowledge management system; new content","Architecture; Distributed computer systems; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Windows operating system; Application systems; Architecture modeling; Cloud storages; Knowledge management system; Literature studies; new content; Push notifications; Storage media; Computer architecture",,,,,,"Iskandar, K., Ibrahim, I., Reina, Perancangan sistem informasi akademis perguruan tinggi berbasis data dikti /epsbed (2011) ComTech, 2 (2); Iskandar, K., Pengembangan knowledge management system pada bina nusantara berbasis microsoft sharepoint 2010 (2014) ComTech, 5 (1), pp. 429-440; Chen, L., Fong, P.S.W., Revealing performance heterogeneity through knowledge management maturity evaluation: A capability-based approach (2012) Expert Syst.

However, file sharing option is not always available and reliable in certain conditions. In this paper, we propose a server for SQLite database. This server will be using HTTP as communication protocol. To enable multiuser application, this server will be multithreaded. However, access to the database file will be synchronized to help prevent database corruption. And, as data-interchange format, JSON will be used. We also run several tests to make sure that proposed server is usable. Test results show that the database file is not corrupted, while still maintain acceptable performance. © 2017 Global IT Research Institute - GiRI.","Concurrent programming; Database server; Embedded database; HTTP server; Multithreaded application","Computer programming; Distributed computer systems; HTTP; Hypertext systems; Acceptable performance; Concurrent programming; Data interchange format; Data-base servers; Embedded database; Multi-threaded application; Multi-user applications; Multiple applications; Database systems",,,,,,"About SQLite, , https://sqlite.org/about.html, The SQLite Development Team; SQLite Frequently Asked Questions, , https://sqlite.org/faq.html, The SQLite Development Team; Owens, M., Embedding an SQL database with SQLite (2003) Linux Journal, (110), p. 2; Most Widely Deployed SQL Database Engine, , https://sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html, The SQLite Development Team; Fielding, R., (1999) Hypertext Transfer protocol-HTTP/1.1 (No. RFC 2616); Nurseitov, N., (2009) Comparison of JSON and XML Data Interchange Formats: A Case Study, pp. 157-162. , Caine; JSON Developer, , http://www.json.org; Fielding, R., Reschke, J., (2014) Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing; Implementation Limits for SQLite, , https://www.sqlite.org/limits.html, The SQLite Development Team; Burnim, J., Sen, K., Asserting and checking determinism for multithreaded programs (2009) Proceedings of the the 7th Joint Meeting of the European Software Engineering Conference and the ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering, pp. 3-12. , August, ACM; SQLite: Documentation, , http://www.sqlite.org/src/doc/trunk/ext/userauth/user-auth.txt, The SQLite Development Team; Noprianto, Simple Web SQLite Manager/Form/Report Application, , https://github.com/nopri/sqliteboy; PostgreSQL: Documentation: Devel: Frontend-Backend Protocol, , https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/protocol.html, The PostgreSQL Global Development Group; Noprianto, Soewito, B., Pangsit: Spreadsheet-like domain-specific programming language for data entry application development (2016) The Eleventh 2016 International Conference on Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems (KICSS)",,,"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI);et al.;Gangwon Convention and Visitors Bureau;IEEE Communication Society (IEEE ComSOc);Korean Institute of Communication Sciences (KICS);National Information Society Agency (NIA)","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","19th International Conference on Advanced Communications Technology, ICACT 2017","19 February 2017 through 22 February 2017",,127106,17389445,9788996865094,,,"English","Int.

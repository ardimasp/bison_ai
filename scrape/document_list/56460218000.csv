Material that can be used to fill voids in the concrete was fly ash. Fly ash used as a filler which was expected to increase the compressive strength. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of fly ash on the concrete compressive strength by using expanded polystyrene (EPS) as a partial substitution of sand. The mix design method was based onSNI 03- 2834-2000, Provisions for Proportioning Normal Concrete Mixture. The percentage of EPS used as a partial substitution of sand was 0%, 10%, 20%, 30% from the weight of the fine aggregate. The percentage of fly ash used as filler was 0%, 7.5%, 10%, 12.5%, 15%, 17.5% from the weight of cement. The highest value of compressive strength for the concrete mix without EPS was concrete mixtures with proportions of 0% EPS + 15% fly ash which had the result of 25.86 MPa. For the concrete mixtures with EPS, the highest compressive strength was EPS 10 % + fly ash 15% with a value of 19.63 MPa. © Research India Publications.",,,,,,,"Ahmad, M.H., Mix Design Of Styrofoam Concrete (2008) International Conference On Construction And Building Technology (ICCBT), A (26), pp. 285-296; Indonesia, B.S., (2000) SNI 03-2834-2000 : Tata Cara Pembuatan Rencana Campuran Beton Normal (Procedure for Normal Mixed Concrete), , Bandung; Indonesia, B.S., (2002) SNI 03-2847-2002 :Tata Cara Perhitungan Struktur Beton Untuk Bangunan Gedung (Procedure for Concrete Structure Calculation For Buildings), , Bandung; Indonesia, B.S., (2002) SNI 03-6815-2002 : Tata Cara Mengevaluasi Hasil Uji Kekuatan Beton (Procedures for Evaluating Compressive Strength of Concrete), , Bandung; Indonesia, B.S., (2002) SNI 06-6867-2002 : Spesifikasi Abu Terbang Dan Pozzolan Lainnya Untuk Digunakan Dengan Kapur (Specifications Fly Ash And Other Pozzolan For Use with Lime), , Bandung; Subhan, T.F.L., Compressive And Tensile Strength Of Expanded Polystyrene Beads Concrete (2005) Sipil, Mesin, Arsitektur, Electro (SMARTek), pp. 227-235; Susanto, R., (2011) Analisis Penambahan Fly Ash Dalam Campuran Beton Dengan Expanded Polystyrene Sebagai Agregat Ringan (Analysis of Fly Ash With Mixed Concrete In Expanded Polystyrene as Lightweight Aggregate), , Jakarta : Universitas Bina Nusantara; Yusuf, R., (2011) Pengaruh Penggantian Pasir Dengan Expanded Polystyrene Terhadap Kuat Tekan Dan Berat Jenis Beton (Effect of Expanded Polystyrene as a Substitution of Sand Against Compressive Strength And Density of Concrete), , Jakarta : Universitas Bina Nusantara","Hidayat, I.; Civil Engineering Department, Binus UniversityIndonesia",,,"Research India Publications",,,,,09734562,,,,"English","Int.

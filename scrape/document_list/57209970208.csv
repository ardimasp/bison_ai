The majority of studies conducted on this issue have thus far focused on the relationship between OCB and job satisfaction, and the results have been mixed. This study hypothesises that OC influences OCB and OL positively, and OCB influences OL positively. Using a quantitative research design, this study sampled 115 hotel staff in Tangerang Indonesia. A structured questionnaire was designed using a 5-point Likert scale. Data testing for reliability and validity was computed using SPSS software, and the data analysed using AMOS and interpreted based on SEM analysis. The result reveals that OL is not influenced by OC directly, but influenced by the OCB of an employee who has OC. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Organisational citizenship behaviour; Organisational commitment; Organisational learning",,,,,,"Aghaei, N., Ziaee, A., Shahrbanian, S., Relationship between learning organization and organizational commitment among employees of sport and youth head office of Western Province of Iran (2012) European Journal of Sports and Exercise Science, 1 (3), pp. 59-69; Amin, Z., Akbar, K.P., Analysis of psychological well-being and turnover intentions of hotele mployees: Anempirical study International Journal of Innovation and Applied Study, 3 (3), pp. 662-671. , 2 0 1 3; Aragón, M.I.B., Jiménez, D.J., Valle, R.S., Training and performance: The mediating role of organizational learning (2014) BRQ Business Research Quarterly, 17 (3), pp. 161-173. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cede.2013.05.003; Becker, T.E., Ullrich, J., Dick, R.F., Within-person variation in affective commitment to teams: Where it comes from and why it matters (2013) Human Resource Management Review, 23 (2), pp. 131-147. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrmr.2012.07.006; Budiman, A., Anantadjaya, S.P., Does job satisfaction influence organizational citizenship behavior?

The problem with this was the large buildup of containers with long periods of time in the cultivation field that would cause losses. Losses due to the duration of the buildup are influenced by several factors, such as the yard of ratio and the length of time the container is reviewed based on the large number of containers in the container yard. For payment of the first five days of service, the container accumulation fare shall be borne by container owner company as stakeholder of port company. After more than five days, the customer will be charged the container accumulation rate calculated per box without any time consideration. This causes the customers don't take the goods immediately, therefore it was necessary to do research on the analysis of port fare increase in port company in Aceh using logistic regression model as the basic of decision making. Based on the prediction of logistic regression model using software R3.4.3, there was a loss cost in the container yard, therefore it was necessary to take decision of the application of the port fare increase on container yard service. Based on the results of these predictions, the resulting model was a good model with an accuracy of 74.8%. The factor that affect of the loss cost was the length of time the container in the container yard period II and III. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Application programs; Decision making; Ergonomics; Logistic regression; Ships; Accumulation rates; Container ships; Container yard; Logistic Regression modeling; Loss costs; Containers",,,,,,"Arvis, J., Mustra, M., Panzer, J., Ojala, L., Naula, T., Connecting to Compete: Trade Logistics in the Global Economy (2016) World Bank, pp. 1-76; Hosmer, D.W., Lemeshow, S., (2000) Applied Logistic Regression; Mehrjoo, S., Bashiri, M., An pplication of Principal Component Analysis and Logistic Regression to Facilitate Production Scheduling Decision Support System : An Automotive Industry Case (2013) Journal of Industrial Engineering, pp. 2-12; Chandrasekaran, R., (2012) Application of Logistic Regression to Predict over Target Baseline of Software Projects, 44, pp. 1-6; Agarwal, S., Kachroo, P., Regentova, E., A Hybrid Model Using Logistic Regression and Wavelet Transformation to Detect Traf Fi C Incidents (2016) IATSS Research.

But, if there is a spatial effect in the data, it must use a spatial model. This is because the independent variables that influence dependent variable can be different at each location. Spatial autoregressive (SAR) model is a spatial method that can be used to describe the relationship between dependent variable and independent variables by considering spatial impact. Before SAR model is carried out, it must be tested for spatial effect using Moran's I. This is used to ensure that there are spatial effect in the data. Because if there is no spatial effect, then can be use a global model, that is linear regression model using Ordinary Least Square (OLS). In this paper, OLS and SAR model was used on average expenditure data of Papua. Expenditures must be made by each region in Indonesia due to subsidies from the central government. Papua is a province that has the highest average expenditure compared to other provinces. Therefore, the average expenditure becomes important thing that needs to be considered by the government of Papua. This is because there must be equal distribution of expenditure at each district / city in Papua. The result of this research indicated that there is a spatial effect on the average expenditure data in Papua. Comparison result of OLS model and SAR model showed that SAR model is better than OLS model. Because MAPE, AIC and RMSE of SAR model are smaller than OLS. © 2019 The Authors.

Several web applications offering this type of services have emerged, but they did not come without limitations to certain products and feature availabilities in them. The limitations to individual personal shoppers were raised as the problems that will be discussed in this study. The purpose of this research was to develop an application that can open an opportunity for anyone to become an entrepreneur as well as requester or personal shopper customer. This research involved literature review, comparative analysis of similar applications, application design and evaluation with proportion testing to compare the proportion of users who agreed to those who disagreed with the statements related to the variables evaluated. In addition, an independent test was also performed to find out about the variables related to users' satisfaction with the application. The researchers suggest developing an e-commerce application with an addition of a bidding feature to increase the level of requester-traveler interaction. From the evaluation results, it can be proven that Nitipyuk is useful and easy to use for users. It only needs improvement in the user interface design to better attract users. © 2019 The Authors.

Attractive learning tools can increase the interest of young people or millennial generations, especially for learning conceptual or too theoretical. Pancasila as the basis of the Indonesian nation's life view needs to be understood by the Indonesian people, especially the younger generation. But the way of learning about the Pancasila is currently too theoretical and does not attract young people. Therefore, by making the game that is liked and favorited by young people today is used to study the Pancasila. Through this research the author wants to analyze the factors that can affect learning experience using game-based learning. Researchers use multiple linear regression methods to analyze these factors. The game prototype developed in this study uses the visual novel genre which has an interesting story. There are 101 respondents as samples. The analysis showed that there are two factors that influence game-based learning, namely the gameplay factor and the story of the game. So, it can be concluded that for developing game based learning we need to pay attention to these two factors and through this visual novel prototype game, it can be concluded that the prototype of this game has an interesting game play and a story that is easy to understand. © 2019 The Authors.

Disaggregated data is very important because some indicators not measured on all characteristics. Detailed disaggregation for development indicators is important to ensure that everyone benefits from development and support better development-related policymaking. This paper aims to explore different methods to disaggregate national employment-to-population ratio indicator to province- and city-level. Numerical approach applied to overcome the problem of disaggregation unavailability by constructing several spatial weight matrices based on the neighbourhood, Euclidean distance and correlation. These methods can potentially be used and further developed to disaggregate development indicators into lower spatial level even by several demographic characteristics. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Operations research; Demographic characteristics; Disaggregation; Euclidean distance; Numerical approaches; Population ratio; Spatial levels; Weight matrices; Weighting approaches; Numerical methods",,,,,,"(2015) The Millennium Development Goals Report, , United Nations; Espey, J., Karoubi, E.M., (2015) A Global Initiative for the United Nations, 26; Pratesi, M., Petrucci, A., Salvati, N., (2015) Global Strategy Technical Report Series GO-07-2015; (2015) Technical Report Series GO-07-2015, , Global Strategy; Flowerdew, R., Green, M., (1994) Areal Interpolation and Types of Data, , (London: Taylor and Francis); Kubicek, M., Janovska, D., Dubcova, M., (2005) Numerical Methods and Algorithm, , (Praha: Vysokaacute;scaron;kolachemicko-technologickaacute; v Praze); McDonough, J.M., (2007) Lectures in Basic Computational Numerical Analysis, , (USA: University of Kentucky); Getis, A., Aldstadt, J., (2003) Geographical Analysis, 36 (2), pp. 90-104; Drukker, D.M., Peng, H., Prucha, I.R., Raciborski, R., (2013) The Stata Journal, 13, pp. 242-286; Tang, B., He, H., (2015) IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, 10 (3), pp. 52-60. , 1556-603x/15copy;2015IEEE; Krislock, N., Wolkowicz, H., (2011) Handbook of Semidefinite, Cone and Polynomial Optimization: Theory, Algorithms, Software and Applications; Amerise, I.L., Tarsitano, A., (2012) Working Paper, 9. , (Italy: Dipartimento di Economia e Statistica, Universita Della Calabria)","Permai, S.D.; Statistics Department, Indonesia; email: syarifah.permai@binus.ac.id","Sudarmo A.P.Kurniawati H.Bakhtiar T.","","Institute of Physics Publishing","Indonesian Operations Research Association - International Conference on Operations Research 2017, IORA-ICOR 2017","12 October 2017 through 12 October 2017",,135626,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The spread of geographically inaccessible Indonesian teachers is a barrier to these measurements. ITEI Android application developed by analysing the geographical problem, so that each teacher can participate wherever they are. The ITEI app is designed by implementing Android on the client side and load balancer on the server side. Android ITEI will feature a number of questions questionnaire to teachers. Meanwhile, the load balancer will distribute the answers to each server for processing. Load Balancer ensures fast data processing and minimize server failure. The results of the processing on the server will be sent back to Android in the form of profiling themselves ITEI teachers. While the data obtained and stored in the server can be used to measure the level of national teachers' engagement.

The difference between Frequentist and Bayesian is the point of view in terms of looking at a parameter. Bayesian views a parameter as a random variable, it means the value is not a single value. The modeling method that most commonly used by researchers is linear regression model. The Frequentist methods that are often used in linear regression are Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). However, along with the Bayesian development, several studies have shown better modeling results than the Frequentist method. On the other hand, Bayesian approach is also used when assumptions in linear regression model using OLS are not met. Therefore, this research performs linear regression modeling with Bayesian approach. The analysis showed that linear regression model using OLS does not met all assumptions. It means the model is not good enough. Then, Bayesian approach can be used as an alternative for the model. The comparison of Bayesian and Frequentist modeling results using several criteria such as RMSE, MAPE and MAD. The results showed that the linear regression method using Bayesian approach is better than Frequentist method using OLS. © 2018 The Authors.

The study concluded that: (1) the ethanol extract and n-hexane fraction of Cassia siamea Lamk (Juar) leaves have anti-diabetic activity in Webster albino mice induced with alloxan, (2) The extract of Cassia siamea Lamk leaves, the fractions of 500 mg ethyl acetate and 500 mg n-Hexana of Cassia siamea Lamk provided better performances in lowering blood glucose levels compared to Ethanol extracts both 500 mg and 1000 mg. In the form of ethyl acetate and n-hexane fraction at a dose of 150 mg/kg BW provided the highest anti-diabetic activity compared to the other test groups that are able to decrease blood sugar level by 10.25% and 9.98% respectively. Its effect is equivalent to glibenclamide at a dose of 0.65 mg/kg BW which can lower blood sugar levels by 9.27%. Thus Cassia siamea Lamk leaf is very potential as an alternative drug antidiabetes mellitus, and (3) the 1000 mg Ethanol extract, 150 mg Ethyl acetate and 150 mg n-Hexana had no difference effects in lowering blood glucose levels compared to the anti-diabetic chemical drug glibenclamide. © 2018 The Authors.

These programs are expected to have a positive outcome which is a better and increased teachers' competence. On the other hand, teacher's well-being might be disturbed by a negative impact from the program. This research aims to seek the subjective wellbeing of teachers in Jakarta and how to help teachers reach its wellbeing. The method use Neuroresearch (mix method), a mixture of qualitative research to build a theoretical construct and also observation as well as in-depth interviews with various parties and quantitative method by using measurement instruments subjective well-being Likert scale. The results found that (1) elementary teachers tend heading to wellbeing significantly at á <0.05 and (2) the cognitive dimension of teachers is an absolute determinant in shaping the well-being of primary school teachers. When a teachers cognitive is improved, then the wellbeing of primary school teachers will be increased by 20.983 from the current conditions. The study also found that the cognitive dimension is determined by the role of family situations and affective quality of teachers capable of acting 13.150 alters cognitive quality teachers. Recommendation from the results of this research is the need for new policies to change the model of teacher competency test that can empower cognitive competencies and simultaneously improve the conditions of teacher's family as the foundation of its economy. © Serials Publications.","Neuroresearch; Subjective well-being",,,,,,,"Ásgeir Jóhannesson, I., Different children - A tougher job (2006) Icelandic Teachers Reflect On Changes in Their Work.

The model equation is called global model. But if the data is a spatial data, where the differences of locations affect the model, then global model is no longer relevant. One of method can be used to analysis for spatial data is Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). GWR is local model that represents model for each location. DKI Jakarta is a province with the highest human development index value in Indonesia. The HDI value is calculated based on some basic components of quality of life. In this paper, we analyze the HDI using multiple linear regression and we get a global model. But because DKI Jakarta consists of some regions with different condition, then we also used spatial data analysis methods. Then we apply GWR method to analyze the HDI in Jakarta. On the GWR model acquired local models for each location. We compared two models of global and local, the results showed that the factors that affect HDI in every region at DKI Jakarta are different. Based on the analysis by linear regression and GWR, the results show that the SSE of GWR model is smaller than linear regression model. So the GWR model is better than linear regression model. © 2016 Author(s).",,,,,,,,"(2012) Ind. Pem. Man.

Likewise, one of many developers in West Jakarta markets its residential area with the Green theme. The purpose of this study is to identify the application of the green architectural design concept in building design and neighborhood at residential area. This research uses descriptive method through survey and field observation. The results showed that almost all criteria of the green concepts have been applied on building design and neighborhood with classical modern style related with theme of the cluster. The criteria are Appropriate Site Development, Energy Efficiency and Conservation, Water Conservation, Indoor Health and Comfort, and Building Environment Management. The use of renewable local materials (bamboo and wood) is not widely applied in home design. But the selection of modern materials follows the green standard, which is material that is already eco-material certified. The supply of building materials also comes from the area around the housing, so it does not use a lot of fossil energy. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Commerce; Energy efficiency; Historic preservation; Housing; Water conservation; Building design; Building environment; Eco-materials; Energy efficiency and conservations; Field observations; Fossil energy; Local materials; Residential areas; Architectural design",,,,,"Ervianto, W.I., (2012) Selamatkan Bumi Melalui Konstruksi Hijau; Itewi, M., Alsafseh, Q., Green Home with Energy Saving Design - Eco Homes in Jordan (2012) Europen Scientific Journal, 8, pp. 107-117; Alvan, S., Novrianty, I.N., Lynna, P.A., Luthan, Konsep Desain Rumah Tinggal Berkelanjutan di Kota Medan Jurnal (2015) Sosek Pekerjaan Umum, 7, pp. 1-79; Nurdiani, N., Katarina, W., Setiawan, D., Sakina, B., (2018) Prosiding Seminar Nasional Infrastruktur Berkelanjutan; Koones, S., Redford, R., (2010) Prefabulous + Sustainable Building and Customizing An Affordable, Energy-Efficient Home; Akmal, I., (2013) Eksplorasi Desain Rumah Hijau","Nurdiani, N.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: nnurdiani@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

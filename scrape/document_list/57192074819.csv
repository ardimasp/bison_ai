This is because recipes play an important role in the process of making dishes such as helping to prepare cooking needs and giving steps in order to produce delicious dishes. The objective of this research is to design a mobile application to help the Indonesian people to access recipes throughout Indonesia. ResepFinder is an application that recommends recipes based on available ingredients and provides solutions to find recipes by using the smartphone camera to detect an object so that the process of finding becomes easy and appealing. Besides that, ResepFinder also allows its user to communicate with others when they encounter a problem. The system design was done by designing the initial framework or work flow in the form of UML diagram and mockup. While the process of conducting research was carried out by spreading several questions through google form and doing some research on study literature to find out users interests toward cooking. The result of this research is an iOS-based mobile application. © 2019 The Authors.

But it still raises some obstacles in the implementation, as it relates to equity and access. In another aspect, e-learning also contains major weaknesses, namely the decrease in the frequency of direct contact between learners and between students with lecturers and other learning resources, so that learning does not experience completeness in all aspects of cognitive and non-cognitive. The weakness is also accompanied by the suspicion of the institution to the honesty of learners in carrying out the learning process. This study aims at building an e-learning model that can bring the intensity and capacity of learners actually through the virtual world through self-assessment based on image processing. The proposed steps are break into several parts: create a dataset of faces that can be used to evaluate given algorithm. Subsequently the enhancement using histogram equalization allows a strong enhancement on facial features. In addition, then the feature descriptor are selected using Viola and Jones [1]. Afterwards, those features will be saved to database. The next step is to build the system than allows the online learners are detected through our image processing approach then all the interaction will be verified using our proposed infrastructure. The results of the study: (a) Image Processing Based E-Learning model was built with a system capable of running in existing infrastructure so far, and (b) Image Processing Based E-Learning model proved valid and reliable both substantially, system and feasibility significant. The results of this study have implications that can be tested on a larger scale that is for some courses and in a particular department. © 2017 IEEE.","E-Learning; Image Processing; Mastery Learning","E-learning; Education computing; Information management; Learning systems; Teaching; Virtual reality; E-learning models; Electronic information; Feature descriptors; Histogram equalizations; Learning process; Learning resource; Mastery learning; Strong enhancement; Image processing",,,,,,"Viola, P., Jones, M., Rapid object detection using a boosted cascade of simple features (2001) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 1, pp. I511-I518; Lockee, B.B., Gros, B., (2017) Learning, Design, and Technology, pp. 1-23. , http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-17727-4, [Online]; Sahid, D.S.S., Santosa, P.I., Ferdiana, R., Lukito, E.N., Evaluation and measurement of Learning Management System based on user experience (2016) Engineering Seminar (InAES), International Annual, pp. 72-77; Tavangarian, D., Leypold, M.E., Nölting, K., Röser, M., Voigt, D., Is e-learning the solution for individual learning?

Keyboard Dynamics is one of the solution to perform password authentication without adding any tools which being disruptive to some users. The biometric keystroke dynamic system is relatively unexplored compared to other behavioral authentications discipline. Coupled with the limited number of studies that have been done compared with other biometric systems. Several machine learning research has been conducted but few of them applying deep learning for solving this problem. This research will be focusing in deep learning using optimizer to beat the previous research which using another machine learning techniques. This research shows a better result using optimizer in deep learning resulting in 92.60% accuracy. © 2018 The Authors.

Therefore, we introduce an image processing method in order to perform unsupervised hand detection. The algorithm does not require any annotation data in order to do hand detection. Image processing step starts from skin detection in order to differentiate skin and non-skin region respectively. Subsequently, the border elimination was performed by specifying coordinates of each categories in dataset. Hand detection was performed by applying canny edge detector combined with hough transform in order to the hand coordinate. The proposed pipeline is validated by three categories of dataset.

Therefore, we introduce an image processing method for automatically detecting stripe defects in circularly knitted fabric. We show how a barely visible defect can be optically enhanced to improve manual assessment as well as how descriptor-based image processing and machine learning can be used to allow automated stripe detection. Image enhancement is performed by applying gabor and matched filters to histogram-equalized fabric images. Subsequently, we extract image information with different descriptors (LBP, GLCM, HOG) and feed these into random forest and SVM classifiers. The full pipeline is validated by training and testing it on three sets of fabric produced with different knitting machines and parameter settings. Results show that the proposed enhancement combined with a statistics-based descriptor such as GLCM or HOG allows to train both tested classifiers with good classification rates of up to 98.9%. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Automation; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Defects; Factory automation; Knit fabrics; Learning systems; Matched filters; Processing; Classification rates; Human inspectors; Image information; Image processing - methods; Knitting machines; Parameter setting; Training and testing; Weft knitted fabrics; Image processing",,,,,,"Kumar, A., Computer-vision-based fabric defect detection: A survey (2008) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 55 (1), pp. 348-363. , Jan; Abou-Taleb, H.A., Sallam, A.T.M., On-line fabric defect detection and full control in a circular knitting machine (2008) AUTEX Research Journal, 8 (1); Shady, E., Gowayed, Y., Abouiiana, M., Youssef, S., Pastore, C., Detection and classification of defects in knitted fabric structures (2006) Textile Research Journal, 76 (4), pp. 295-300; Saeidi, R.G., Latifi, M., Najar, S.S., Saeidi, A.G., Computer visionaided fabric inspection system for on-circular knitting machine (2005) Textile Research Journal, 75 (6), pp. 492-497; Sun, Y., Long, H.-R., Adaptive detection of weft-knitted fabric defects based on machine vision system (2011) Journal of the Textile Institute, 102 (10), pp. 823-836; Jeffrey Kuo, C.-F., Shih, C.-Y., Huang, C.-C., Wen, Y.-M., Image inspection of knitted fabric defects using wavelet packets (2015) Textile Research Journal; Bovik, A.C., Clark, M., Geisler, W.S., Multichannel texture analysis using localized spatial filters (1990) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 12 (1), pp. 55-73. , Jan; Ojala, T., Pietikäinen, M., Mäenpää, T., Multiresolution gray-scale and rotation invariant texture classification with local binary patterns (2002) Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on, 24 (7), pp. 971-987; Dalal, N., Triggs, B., Histograms of oriented gradients for human detection (2005) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2005.

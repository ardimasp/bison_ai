Most people think of games as a means of playing and wasting time, but games can be used as stress relievers, learning media, making money and many more uses. Therefore, the game requires a good game experience (GX). The GX in question is GX which can make users understand and feel the situation or condition of emotions playing the game. © 2019 IEEE.","Counter-Strike: Global Offensive; First person shooter; Game experience","Artificial intelligence; Counter-Strike: Global Offensive; First person shooter; Game experience; Learning media; Computer games",,,,"Binus University","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is partially supported by Research Interest Group In Educational Technology, Bina Nusantara University.

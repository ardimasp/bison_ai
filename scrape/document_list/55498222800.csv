One of their strategies is through digital marketing approaches. However, VGM decides to reinstate its photography ban at roughly the same time the 'selfie' trend is booming all over the world, which might hinder the museum's mission. This case study explores issues in a museum business that slightly differ, yet still holds high relevance to any regular business in terms of digital communication strategy. The aims of this case study are to exercise a decision-making process in which the visitors and the non-visitors of the VGM play a major role, and to initiate creativity in discovering ways to communicate and creating relationship with the public or targeted audience. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Co.",,,,,,,"Hein, A., Amsterdam: 18+ Million Visitors (2016) Dutch Amsterdam, , http://www.dutchamsterdam.nl/4456-amsterdam-europe-eight-most-popular-citydestination, 2 February, accessed on July 1 2017; Pieters, J., Record Year for Amsterdam Museum Attendance, , http://nltimes.nl/2014/11/24/record-year-amsterdam-museum-attendanceace, 24 November 2014, NL Times, ssed on July 1 2017; (2014) Beeldende Kunst Favorite Onder de Musea: Infographic, , http://www.cultuurmarketing.nl/beeldende-kunst-favoriet-onder-de-museainfographic/#WV3p3cqlbqA, EM-Cultuur. 10 August 2014, accessed on July 4 2017; Pieters, J., (2014) Record Year for Amsterdam Museum Attendance, , http://nltimes.nl/2014/11/24/record-year-amsterdam-museum-attendance, 24 November, accessed on July 1 2017; Pieters, J., Record Year for Amsterdam Museum Attendance (2014) NL Times, , http://nltimes.nl/2014/11/24/record-year-amsterdam-museum-attendance, 24 November, accessed on July 1 2017; Encyclopaedia Britannica Van Gogh Museum, , http://www.britannica.com/topic/Van-Gogh-Museum, accessed on June 17 2017; (2014) VGM, p. 10. , http://vangoghmuseum-assetserver.appspot.com/serveid=5786521927942144&filename=VGM-Strategisch-Plan-2014-2017-ENG, Strategic Plan 2014-2017, accessed on June 17 2017; (2014) Strategic Plan 2014-2017, , http:://vangoghmuseum-assetserver.appspot.com/serveid=5786521927942144&filename=VGM-Strategisch-Plan-2014-2017-ENG, VGM, accessed on June 17 2017; National Gallery of Art.

Method: Primary data for the study was collected through questionnaires as part of the survey research strategy applied. Linear regression was used to signify interactions between experiential marketing, customer loyalty, and customer satisfaction. Furthermore, One-Way ANOVA was also applied in order to indicate differences of the variables between the respondents’ perceptions of the three premium supermarkets. Results: In the Jakarta premium supermarket context, experiential marketing showed a direct and linear effect on customer satisfaction. However, experiential marketing showed an insignificant relationship with customer satisfaction when it was moderated by customer loyalty. Furthermore, based on the comparison test findings, there was a significant difference of experiential marketing factors as perceived by the respondents, while there is none for customer loyalty and customer satisfaction. Conclusion: the study signifies, in the Jakarta’s premium supermarkets context, that experiential marketing has a significant impact on these retailers. However, people in Jakarta did not exhibit particular loyalty to the premium supermarkets they frequented. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

They play an important role as workforce providers and expertise in creating value and are one of the primary sources needed in every production process. Therefore, every organization needs reliable workforce support that can help reach their vision and mission. This includes the BINUS BUSINESS SCHOOL institution, which is trying to achieve its long term vision to become a ""World-Class Knowledge Institution"" by 2020. It is even more so by looking at the condition of the Indonesian upper educational industry that since early 2000 has been competing to provide new educational services to society, especially in the form of business school service. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain employee satisfaction along with their commitment and involvement in supporting the effort to achieve the long term target. The purpose of this research is to analyze the influence of employee satisfaction moderated by employee engagement towards employee work performance and retention. The respondents participated within the study are all employees of the institution, with the data gathering techniques applied include questionnaires and multiple regression analytical method with moderating variable. The study results show that employee satisfaction has significant positive influence towards employee work performance and retention. In contrast, employee engagement does not provide a significant influence toward employee work performance nor retention.","Employee engagement; Employee satisfaction; Employee work performance; Moderating variable; Retention",,,,,,"Batt, R., Managing Customer Services: Human Resource Practice, Quit Rates, and Sales Growth (2002) Academy of Management Journal, 45, pp. 587-597; Bernotavicz, F., (1997) Retention of Child Welfare Caseworkers, , Paper presented to the Maine Bureau of Child and Family Services, University of Southern Maine; Bubenick, G.K., (2004) Improvement of Key Employee Retention Rates Through Attention to and Nurturance of Their Neuropsychological Preferences, , Dissertation submitted to the graduate Faculty of the Department of Psychology, North Central University; Cooper, D.R., Schindler, P.S., (2008) Business Research Method, , 10 th ed.

Radicalism gives destructive impacts to an attacked country and the global society. It is not only makes a serious threat to a nation unity, yet it also impacts the cultural, socio-political, and economic among the others. This study is aim to study radicalism intention using content detection. The model was developed using social media content like posting, comment and conversation to indicate the level of radicalism. Data was collected from a Twitter. It has chosen as a social media platform because Twitter can engage the community with powerful and impactful microblogging function. The data was analyzed using machine learning. To be specifically, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) in text mining employed for classification of Twitter's content in national language of republic Indonesia. There were two focus keywords used in this study. The first one is ISIS and follow by Syria. The result shows that 83.3% accuracy of test set tuples, 90% part of the contents indicates positive link to radicalism with no-radicalism class as a precision value. Besides recall value was calculated for accuracy, 95% and 82% part of actual text positively link as radicalism class with a proxy of no-radicalism class. This model is hoped to detect and overcome the terrorism issue in Indonesia. © 2020 IEEE.","Machine learning; Radicalism; Support vector machine; Terrorism; Twitter","Information management; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Text mining; Content detection; Global society; Microblogging; National language; Social media; Social media platforms; Support vector machine techniques; Test sets; Support vector machines",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

Efficient solution for both tasks depended on remote sensing technology to capture and analyze remotely sensed data of the region of interest. Although a plethora of methods for land cover classification have been reported, the problem remained a challenging task in computer vision field. The advent of deep learning method in the past decade has been very instrumental to develop a robust method for land cover classification using satellite imagery as input. The objective of this paper was to present empiric results on using CNN as a land cover classifier model using Sentinel-2 spatial satellite imagery. Prior to model training, the input image representation was extracted using eCognition to produce texture, brightness, shape, and vegetation index. Land cover labeling followed the Land Cover Class in Medium Resolution Optical Imagery Interpretation document provided by Indonesian National Standardization Agency. The training of CNN model achieved 0.98 mean training accuracy and 0.98 mean testing accuracy. As comparison, the same data and same feature were trained with another model: Gradient Boosting Model (GBM). The results revealed that the training accuracy and testing accuracy with GBMs were 0.98 and 0.95 respectively. CNN model showed small improvement of the accuracy to classify land cover with the image feature (NDVI, Brightness, GLCM homogeneity and Rectangular fit). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","CNN; Land cover classification; Satellite imagery",,,,,,,,"Weng, Q., Mao, Z., Lin, J., Liao, X., Land-use scene classification based on a CNN using a constrained extreme learning machine (2018) Int.

This paper focused on airport domain in Indonesia since detection of airport imagery features was an open challenge due to various features were used to describe the visual existence of an airport. Main characteristics of real-world definition for airport domain were identified by using the reference from Klasifikasi Penutup Lahan SNI 7645 Badan Standardisasi Nasional (Land Cover Classification SNI 7645 National Standardization Body) and Ministry of the Transportation Republic of Indonesia. Subsequently, image description of airport domain was defined based on the real-world description of the airport. This description used image features consideration namely spatial, spectral (color and texture) which was organized as ontological properties itself. At the end, the formal representation of airport domain was designed by mapping real-world description of an object into image description. This paper showed ontology approach could be used to design the formal representation of land cover by mapping real-world description of an object into image description.

Medical image data is formed by pixels that correspond to a part of a physical object and produced by imaging modalities. Exploration of medical image data methods is a challenge in the sense of getting their insight value, analyzing and diagnosing of a specific disease. Image classification plays an important role in computer-aided-diagnosis and is a big challenge on image analysis tasks. This challenge related to the usage of methods and techniques in exploiting image processing result, pattern recognition result and classification methods and subsequently validating the image classification result into medical expert knowledge. The main objective of medical images classification is not only to reach high accuracy but also to identify which parts of human body are infected by the disease. This paper reviewed the state-of-the-art of image classification techniques to diagnose human body disease. The review covered identification of medical image classification techniques, image modalities used, the dataset and trade off for each technique. At the end, the reviews showed the improvement of image classification techniques such as to increase accuracy and sensitivity value and to be feasible employed for computer-aided-diagnosis are a big challenge and an open research. © 2016 IEEE.","disease diagnosis; image classification; medical informatics","Classification (of information); Computer aided analysis; Computer aided diagnosis; Diagnosis; Economic and social effects; Image analysis; Image processing; Information management; Medical imaging; Pattern recognition; Classification methods; Classification results; Classification technique; Disease diagnosis; Images classification; Medical informatics; Sensitivity values; State of the art; Image classification",,,,,,,"Procter, R., (2016) Definition of Health Informatics, , https//www.nlm.nih.gov/hsrinfo/informatics.html, Aug. 01,[Aug. 03, 2016]; Bui, A.A.T., Taira, R.K., Kangarloo, H., Introduction (2010) Medical Imaging Informatics, pp. 3-14. , New York: Springer; Roque, F.S., Jensen, P.B., Schmock, H., Dalgaard, M., Andreatta, M., Hansen, T., Søeby, K., Jensen, L.J., Using electronic patient records to discover disease correlations and stratify patient cohorts (2011) PLOS Computational Technology, 7 (8), pp. 1-10; Qiu, Y., Zhen, S., Zhou, M., Li, L., Continuously improve the medical care quality and hospital management level through medical information system construction (2012) Journal of Translational Medicine, 10, p.

As a contribution to support prevention of this phenomenon, this paper proposes a mining model using a naïve Bayes classifier that could detect cardiovascular disease and identify its risk level for adults. Methods: The process of designing the method began by identifying the knowledge related to the cardiovascular disease profile and the level of cardiovascular disease risk factors for adults based on the medical record, and designing a mining technique model using a naïve Bayes classifier. Evaluation of this research employed two methods: accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity calculation as well as an evaluation session with cardiologists and internists. The characteristics of cardiovascular disease are identified by its primary risk factors. Those factors are diabetes mellitus, the level of lipids in the blood, coronary artery function, and kidney function. Class labels were assigned according to the values of these factors: risk level 1, risk level 2 and risk level 3. Results: The evaluation of the classifier performance (accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) in this research showed that the proposed model predicted the class label of tuples correctly (above 80%). More than eighty percent of respondents (including cardiologists and internists) who participated in the evaluation session agree till strongly agreed that this research followed medical procedures and that the result can support medical analysis related to cardiovascular disease. Conclusions: The research showed that the proposed model achieves good performance for risk level detection of cardiovascular disease. © 2016 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.","Bayes Theorem; Cardiovascular Diagnostic Techniques; Cardiovascular Diseases; Classification; Data Mining",,,,,,,,"Shouman, M., Turner, T., Stocker, R., Using data mining techniques in heart disease diagnosis and treatment.

Higher education information system generates many transactional data; and the amount of those data is increased day by day, but the use of data has not been explored optimally. Each data stored at data storage media is issued for separate purposes. On the other hand, a higher education organization needs to gain overall knowledge from all data. Based on these conditions, organization needs an analytical tool to extract information and discover valuable knowledge from huge amount of data. These processes require more processing time and more complex process. The purpose of this research was to design the data warehouse model and dashboard for analytical tool and use data mining technique for higher education institutions. The research method began with designing the knowledge needs; designing and developing transformation model to data warehouse; using data mining techniques and designing dashboard for analytical tool. The obtained result was the model of data warehouse, data mining and analytical tool for higher education institution that will improve institution's performance, and help them to improve analytical and decision making process. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

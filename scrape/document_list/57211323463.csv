Astra Credit Company (ACC) is one of automotive financing service provider which has already applied IT. As a big company, the large scale of the utilization of IT in ACC also raised the need for managing the IT Helpdesk. Currently ACC already uses an application to support IT Helpdesk business process called IT Care. But as the development of business process and the changing needs of the company, the system is no longer able to support business process needs. Based on those needs this research was conducted to develop system design that can meet current business needs. Design and analysis process done through System Development Life Cycle methodology with Object Oriented Analysis and Design approach using Unified Model Language diagram. System analysist and design activities developed several processes i.e. Chart Of Account management based with time estimation, ticket submission, ticket assignment with consideration of staff balancing work load, completion ticket based on priority, also reporting of IT staff performance and ticket completion. Conclusions from the results of the analysis and design of IT Care systems are a proposed IT Care system design that is expected to overcome the problems in the existing IT Care system. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Balancing; Competition; Human resource management; Life cycle; Object oriented programming; Systems analysis; Account management; Business competition; Business Process; Design and analysis; Design information; Object oriented analysis and design; System development life cycles; Unified modeling language diagrams; Design",,,,,"Satzinger, J.W., Burd, S.D., Jackson, R.B., (2012) Introduction to Systems Analysis and Design: An Agile, Iterative Approach, , Course Technology, Cengage Learning; Tegarden, D.P., Dennis, A., Wixom, B.H., (2012) Systems Analysis and Design with UML, , (John Wiley amp; Sons, Inc.); Omarsson, G.I., (2010) Knowledge Management in An IT-Help Desk Environment; Purwanto, I., (2011) Seminar Nasional Aplikasi Teknologi Informasi, , (SNATI) Desain Sistem Help Desk Troubleshooting Hardware Dan Software Online June; Bansode, J., Visaria, R., Varhadi, A., Patania, D., Software Development for IT Service Help Desk (2015) International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication, 3 (2), pp. 852-855; Bertram, D., Voida, A., Greenberg, S., Walker, R., (2009) Communication, Collaboration, and Bugs: The Social Nature of Issue Tracking in Software Engineering, , (University of Calgary); Connolly, T., Begg, C., Database Systems (2005) A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation & Management"" Addison Wesley; Connolly, R., (2015) Fundamentals of Web Development, , (Pearson Education); Coronel, C., Morris, S., (2016) Database Systems: Design, Implementation, & Management, , (Cengage Learning); Bansode, J., Visaria, R., Varhadi, A., Patania, D., Software Development for IT Service Help Desk (2015) International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication, 3 (2), pp. 852-855; Mustopa, A., (2017) Sistem Informasi It-help Deskpada Universitas Amikom Yogyakarta Berbasis Web.

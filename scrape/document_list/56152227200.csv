To secure the house, the occupants of the house will always have the door locked. However, sometimes the house occupants forget to lock the door due to hurry when leaving the house, or they may doubt whether they have locked the door or not. We propose an application called Door Security System which is based on Android using Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor the status of the door, controlling the door and increasing security in a house. MQTT cloud is utilized as the communication protocol between smartphone and door lock system. PIR sensor is implemented in the door lock to detect the movement near the door, while touch sensor is installed on the door handle to recognize the human hand. Should the door is opened by force, the alarm will ring and send notification to alert the house occupant on the existence of intruder in the house. The evaluation results show that motion detection sensor can detect movement accurately up to 1,6 meters ahead, and messages published between smartphone and door lock are encrypted properly so messages are safely sent. © 2019 The Authors.

Travelers create the itinerary before they are travelling to an area. However, creating itinerary is not easy, many factors need to be considered before deciding where to go, such as the “must visited” places in that area, distance between tourist attractions to be visited within a day, preferred tourist attractions, and other information about the places. Generating the optimized distance itinerary is similar as a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The purpose of this research is to study the combination of simulated annealing and Greedy algorithms to create an itinerary. The initialization process of the simulated annealing algorithm uses Greedy algorithm searching technique and then proceeded with existing optimization step in simulated annealing method. This paper proposed a method of enhanced simulated annealing algorithm and the experiment results show the enhanced simulated annealing increase the effectiveness of simulated annealing algorithm which produce the shortest distance needed to travel places around an area. © 2019 The Authors.

Companies can use information obtained from social media to analyze how the communities respond to their services or products. The biggest challenge in processing information in social media like Twitter, is the unstructured sentences which could lead to incorrect text processing. However, this information is very important for companies’ survival. In this research, we proposed a method to extract keywords from tweets in Indonesian language, WPKE. We compared it with RAKE, an algorithm that is language independent and usually used for keyword extraction. Finally, we develop a method to do clustering to groups the topics of complaints with data set obtained from Twitter using the “komplain” hashtag. Our method can obtain the accuracy of 72.92% while RAKE can only obtain 35.42%. Copyright © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Round-robin system which is commonly used in tournament cannot be efficiently used regarding to the number of participant. The higher the number of participant, the longer and the more exhausted the players. This paper suggests Swiss pairing system to do scheduling in Xiang Qi tournament. The capacity of the tournament can be increased, but the player can still compete with the optimal result. The pairing function considers the player's record, the 'bye' notes, the player's color preferences, and the origin of the player's club.

However, the limitation of the length that can be written is about 160 characters and the text is in unstructured sentence. It becomes the biggest obstacle to process the information. Those unstructured sentences cause a difficulty for preprocessing in text processing tools. Therefore, normalization is needed to make the unstructured sentences can be more understandable by a machine. We proposed a normalization of Indonesian language method which adopting some ideas of normalization from other researchers and adjust to the problem of Indonesian characteristic in unstructured sentence. The experiment exploits Twitter data which use Indonesian language in complaint category. The process is divided into three stages, which are cleaning process, OOV detection and word replacement. List of Basic words and Slang dictionary are used in the OOV detection. On the other hand, Context dictionary is built to solve the ambiguity problem. The algorithm can reaches the accuracy about 90% in a complaint category. © 2017 The Authors.

This fish has become one of the profitable business opportunities for fish farmers, mainly for export to overseas because the price is quite expensive. However, Discus fish is difficult to maintain since it is susceptible to various diseases. An expert system application utilizing fuzzy logic is presented to resolve this problem by diagnosing diseases of the discus fish. It is expected to help beginner fish farmers to detect the disease in the earliest time. Besides diagnosing, this desktop-based application can be exploited to get more information about the diseases in order to prevent and treat the Discus fish.

Some business sectors require the information contained in the ID card to perform the registration process. In general, the registration process is still using a form to be filled in accordance with the data on the ID card, which will then be converted into digital data by means of retyping the information. The purpose of this research is to create a character recognition system on the ID card where the character recognition process included into four stages: pre-processing, text-area extraction, segmentation and recognition. The experiment includes some tests of greyscale, binarization and segmentation algorithm, as well as the combination of those algorithms. Text area extractor showed satisfactory results of identifying text-area on the ID card, which can scope all the entire area that consist of text. In the segmentation stage, approximately 93% of character can be cut off correctly. The actual character will be mapped to the template character using two algorithms where the division grid of each of them is different. Nevertheless, the recognition process of applying the template method matching still needs to be improved back. © 2015 The Authors.

The current technology development makes the classic games have to adapt by converting the style of play, such as online version of the classic game. N-tier architecture provides a model for software developers to create an application which has a high flexibility and reusability. By dividing the application into some tiers, developers have options to modify or add a particular layer, instead of changing the whole application. The implementation of n-tier can be done by supporting with internet. The combination of Xiang Qi with online game technology based on web is expected to be successful in attracting the attention of gamers/players. The paper presents a re-packaging of conventional games into an online game application which built using n-tier developing approach that can manage accessibility and interactivity of the games. © 2015 The Authors.

Humans are able to recognize entities by context, but information extraction systems (IES) need to apply sophisticated algorithms to recognize an entity. The development and implementation of an entity recognition algorithm is described in this paper. The implemented system is integrated with an IES that derives triples from unstructured text. By doing so, the triples are more valuable in query answering because they refer to identified entities. By extracting the information from Wikipedia encyclopedia, a dictionary of entities and their contexts is built. The entity recognition computes a score for context similarity which is based on cosine similarity with a tf-idf weighting scheme and the string similarity. The implemented system shows a good accuracy on Wikipedia articles, is domain independent, and recognizes entities of arbitrary types. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,"Database systems; Cosine similarity; Domain independents; Entity recognition; Information extraction systems; Retrieval applications; String similarity; Unstructured texts; Wikipedia articles; Information retrieval systems",,,,,"Bast, H., Chitea, A., Suchanek, F.M., Weber, I., Ester: Efficient search on text, entities, and relations (2007) Proceedings of the 30th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, pp. 671-678. , Kraaij, W., de Vries, A.P., Clarke, C.L.A., Fuhr, N., Kando, N.

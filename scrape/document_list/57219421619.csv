There are many types of cooking oil such as olive oil, palm oil, canola oil, vegetable oil and etc. Normally, only two or three times the oil can be used for fry. After that, the oil will throw away. The disposal of used cooking oil is an important factor for the waste-management. Most people will dump the used cooking oil in the kitchen sink. This will led to blockage to the pipe and contaminate water. Without people realise, used cooking oil can be recycled in to soap for general purposes. The aim of this research is to develop a semi-automatic machine for making soap by using used cooking oil as main ingredients. There were a lots of process involved such as how to gain the voice of customer (VOC), concept selection, detail design, fabrication and testing process in order to verify the quality and time taken to produce the soaps. This machine can be used in every kitchen of household and not for mass production. Meanwhile, user can make their own soap for general purpose such as to wash floor, car and drain. Moreover, this can save environment. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Design and Development; NaOH Pallet; Prototype; Saponification; Soap",,,,,"Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka, UTeM

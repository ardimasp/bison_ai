Apart from being a medium for learning and conveying various information about Indonesia, BIPA teaching can also introduce Indonesian culture to foreign speakers. From year to year, international speakers who learn Indonesian continue to grow. This was accompanied by an increase in the number of BIPA providers in Indonesia. To support the acceleration of this growth, digital service is needed to make it easier to find native speaker tutors and adjust material according to the needs of foreign speakers. This digital service is a website that can bring international speakers and Indonesian language tutors wherever they are. This website is named BIPALOKA, which is a digital platform that bridges language lovers around the world who want to learn Indonesian from the community of Professional Indonesian tutors. The method used in making the BIPALOKA website is a waterfall model, which in the process is made in stages starting from analysis, planning, implementation, checking, deploying, and ending with maintenance. © 2020 IEEE.","Bahasa indonesia; BIPA; BIPALOKA; Native speaker; Website","Distance education; Information management; Web Design; Websites; Digital platforms; Digital services; Indonesia; Indonesian languages; Learning programs; Waterfall model; Information services",,,,,"Widyartono, D., Pembelajaran bahasa Indonesia untuk penutur asing berbasis blended learning (2017) Konferensi Internasional Pengajaran BIPA: Pemartabatan Bahasa Indonesia Dalam Menghadapi Perubahan Konstelasi Politik Dan Ekonomi Dunia, , Batu, Malang, Jawa Timur; Dereh, N.-M., Bipa learning media: Management and problems (2019) ISLLAC: Journal of Intensive Studies on Language, Literature, Art, and Culture, 3 (1), pp. 44-48; (2020) DARMASISWA Indonesia SCHOLARSHIP, , https://darmasiswa.kemdikbud.go.id/aboutus-2/, [Accessed 22 January 2020]; (2020), https://kemlu.go.id/nairobi/id/news/5112/pendaftaran-beasiswa-knb-2020-dibuka, [Accessed 29 February 2020]; Roger, P., Pressman, S., (2009) Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach, , 7th International edition, New York: McGraw-Hill; Maylawati, D.S., Darmalaksana, W., Ramdhani, M.A., Systematic design of expert system using unified modelling language (2017) The 2nd Annual Applied Science and Engineering Conference (AASEC), , Bandung, Indonesia; Irvan, R., Taufiq, M., Slamet, C., Andrian, R., Aulawi, H., Ramdhani, M.A., Early warning system in mobile-based impacted areas (2018) International Journal of Engineering and Technology, 7 (3-4), pp. 118-121; Slamet, C., Rahman, A., Sutedi, A., Darmalaksana, W., Ramdhani, M.A., Maylawati, D.S., Social media-based identifier for natural disaster (2017) The 2nd Annual Applied Science and Engineering Conference (AASEC), , Bandung, Indonesia; Slamet, C., Rahman, A., Ramdhani, M.A., Darmalaksana, W., Clustering the verses of the holy qur'an using k-means algorithm (2016) Asian Journal of Information Technology, 15 (24), pp. 5159-5162; Maylawati, D.S., Ramdhani, M.A., Zulfikar, W.B., Taufik, I., Darmalaksana, W., Expert system for predicting the early pregnancy with disorders using artificial neural network (2017) 5th International Conference on Cyber and IT Service Management (CITSM), , Denpasar, Indonesia; Zulfikar, W.B., Prasetyo, J.P., Ramdhani, M.A., Implementation of mamdani fuzzy method in employee promotion system (2017) The 2nd Annual Applied Science and Engineering Conference (AASEC), , Bandung, Indonesia; Maylawati, D.S., Ramdhani, M.A., Rahman, A., Darmalaksana, W., Incremental technique with set of frequent word item sets for mining large Indonesian text data (2017) 5th International Conference on Cyber and IT Service Management (CITSM), , Denpasar, Indonesia; Ramdania, D., Irfan, M., Saprudin, R., Alam, C.N., Ramdhani, M.A., Yusli, D., Web-based design for lecturer performance reporting applications (2018) Mathematics, Science and Computer Science Education International Seminar (MSCEIS), , Bandung, Indonesia; Hariyanto, A., (2015) Membuat Web Profil Sekolah Dan PPDB Online, , 2nd ed., Yogyakarta: Lokomedia",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","5th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2020","13 August 2020 through 14 August 2020",,163671,,9781728170718,,,"English","Proc.

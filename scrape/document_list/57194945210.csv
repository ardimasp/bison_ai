The transportation need not only applied for the local, Jakarta as a capital city must be full of foreigner either for business purpose or others, and they are need a public transportation as well. Commuter Line Jabodetabek is the most preferable public transportation to avoid Jakarta's traffic. The idea is to create a mobile application system which could easily help Commuter Line Jabodetabek user to get the information about timetable schedule, arrange the route and transit information and find how to reach the destination as well as how long to get there and how much does it cost, and visualize the route in easy-to-understand format. The application system is analyzed and designed with mobile application development approach and the application development with cloud computing provided by Application Craft, and the result of this study is prototype application design with cross-platform based. © 2017 IEEE.","Commuter line; Information; Mobile application; Transportation","Distributed computer systems; Information management; Mass transportation; Mobile computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Software prototyping; Transportation; Application development; Application systems; Commuter line; Information; Mobile application development; Mobile applications; Public transportation; Transportation needs; Urban transportation",,,,,"(2012) Master Plan Study for Establishing Metropolitan Priority Area for Investment and Industry (MPA) in JABODETABEK Area, , https://www.jica.go.jp/english/news/press/2012/121009.html, Japan International Cooperation Agency.

Advances in the business and entertainment sectors drive the evolution of computer equipment with increasingly sophisticated technology that can make things easier. The development of equipment that supports virtual reality technology is also increasingly modern and realistic, so that the use and the utilization of virtual reality technology can also be widened in various disciplines. Researchers and educators also start competing to explore their potential, develop pedagogical strategies, create teaching materials, and build technology-based and educational infrastructure to find learning systems that are more likely by students and can present high-quality, easy and fun education. In this study, it will be reviewed how the role of Virtual reality technology can help students in understanding the science of building construction.

Whereas, the local electricity or the grid is the main energy source for the lighting and water pump machine, therefore the energy source becomes a significant issue during this period. Currently, the local government has already provided diesel generators to substitute the local grid when it is off, however, the amount of the generators is still limited. This study, therefore, investigated an alternative energy for the electricity, particularly solar energy and this paper presents an analysis of the Jakarta duration of sunshine during rainy seasons in order to investigate which Crystalline Silicone solar cell type that can be implemented optimally for energy supply in the period of flood evacuation as well as for the shelter. A deep analysis on literature review was conducted on the three types of Crystalline Silicone solar cell, Jakarta local weather. Furthermore, the standard of International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) was also studied for the shelter design.

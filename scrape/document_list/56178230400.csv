Despite its importance, many healthcare challenges exist, as a result of increased costs that are not associated with the quality of healthcare. Consequently, the primary purpose of this investigation is to examine the role of information technology (IT) in mediating the effect of medical resources on clinical performance. Medical resources were measured using human resource and medical technology dimensions. The research capability is referred to as IT and knowledge management capabilities. An empirical survey was conducted at 34 accredited hospitals located in the Special Capital Region of Jakarta. A multivariate statistical analysis, applying structural equation modeling – partial least squares, revealed that the role of IT capabilities were statistically significant in mediating the effect of medical human resources on clinical performance. No significant direct effect of medical resources on clinical performance was observed. The results imply the significant role of IT capabilities in healthcare industries, particularly in hospitals in Jakarta, Indonesia. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Nevertheless, the data warehouse implementation has not been widely applied in the field of healthcare. The purpose of this research was to determine the effectiveness of radiological data warehouse implementation in the fields of education, research, and guarantee the quality of radiology services in the hospital. Evaluation was carried out to the radiology data warehouse dashboard that had been previously developed. Specific targets to be achieved were to get input from the radiologist for the development of radiology data warehouse implemented in the hospital or radiology clinic. The methods used were data collection through literature study and questionnaires as well as radiology data warehouse evaluation in accordance with Inmon (2005). The results obtained from this study were to know the degree of interest and radiologists perception about the radiology data warehouse dashboard. It was concluded that the most important report for radiologist was the dashboard of patient demographics and the non-volatile characteristics required special attention because it was quite important for all dashboards. © 2016 IEEE.","data warehouse; radiology; radiology information systems","Data warehouses; Hospitals; Information management; Quality assurance; Radiation; Radiology; Surveys; Data collection; Degree of interests; Literature studies; Non-volatile; Radiology information system; Quality control",,,,,"Kartawiguna, D., Georgiana, V., Model development of integrated web-based radiology information system with radio diagnostic imaging modality in radiology department (2014) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 63 (2); Kesehatan, K., (2016) Kamus Kesehatan, , http//kamuskesehatan.com/arti/radiologi, [Accessed 10 10 2016]; Osama, E.S., Eldeen, A.N., Evaluating a healthcare data warehouse for cancer diseases (2013) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology & Security, 3 (3), pp. 237-241; Georgiana, V., Kartawiguna, D., Indrajani, Radiology data warehouse development as a means of education, research, and quality assurance (2015) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 73, pp. 65-71; Inmon, W., (2005) Building the Data Warehouse, , 4th ed., USA: John Wiley & Sons Inc; Conolly, T.M., Begg, C.E., (2005) Database System: A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation, and Management, , 4th ed., USA: Addison Weesley, Longman Inc; Mallach, E.G., (2000) Decision Support and Data Warehouse Systems, , 1st ed., McGraw-Hill/Irwin; Destercke, S., Buche, P., Charnomordic, B., Evaluating data reliability: An evidential answer with application to a web-enabled data warehouse (2013) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 25 (1); Rubin, D.L., Desser, T.S., Radbank: Building an integrated data warehouse for radiology teaching, process improvement, and research (2003) Radiology, 229 (S607), pp. 210-217; Dos-Santos, M., Fujino, A., Interactive radiology teaching file system: The development of a MIRC-compliant and user-centered elearning resource (2012) 2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, , San Diego, California USA; Roelofs, E.A., Benefits of a clinical data warehouse with data mining tools to collect data for a radiotherapy trial (2013) Radiotherapy and Oncology, 108 (1), pp. 174-179; Demigha, S., A data warehouse system to help assist breast cancer screening in diagnosis, education and research (2010) 2009 2nd International Conference on Computer Science and Its Applications, , Jeju, Korea (South); Han, J., Kamber, M., Pei, J., (2012) Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, , 3rd ed., Morgan Kaufmann",,,"BINUS Univerity;IEEE Indonesia Section;Wiley","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2016","16 November 2016 through 18 November 2016",,127842,,9781509033522,,,"English","Proc.

A lot of hospitals have digital radiodiagnostic modality that supports the DICOM protocol. However, the implementation of integrated radiology information system with medical imaging equipment is still very limited until now, especially in developing countries like Indonesia. One of the obstacles is high prices for radiology information system. Whereas the radiology information systems can be widely used by radiologists to provide many benefit for patient, hospitals, and the doctors themselves. This study aims to develop a system that integrates the radiology administration information system with radiodiagnostic imaging modalities. Such a system would give some benefits that the information obtained is more accurate, timely, relevant, and accelerate the workflow of healthcare workers. This research used direct observation method to some hospital radiology unit. Data was collected through interviews, questionnaires, and surveys directly to some of the hospital's radiology department in Jakarta, and supported by the literature study. Based on the observations, the prototype of integrated patient registration systems in radiology unit is developed and interfaced to imaging equipment radiodiagnostic using standard DICOM communications.

Some of the reasons are because of these areas have special characteristics which are: 1) the data and information in the medical information systems consist of many data types, such as alphanumeric, graphics, images, and sounds; 2) health workers are always mobile in performing their duties; 3) the source data is not only coming from the physician or health worker but also could be obtained from high-tech medical equipment; 4) when an error occurs in any health care data processing could caused death to the patient. The main function of the medical information system is not only used for management purposes but it also used for managing clinical data that will be useful for the development of medical science. Radiology department is one of the hospital departments that use many computerized systems. Therefore, the implementation of information systems in radiology departments will provide tangible benefits to patients and the health care service provider itself. The objective of this study is to develop a model of a web-based radiology information system based on medical workflows and integrated with the radio diagnostic imaging modality. The research method used on this study is data collection through literature review, interviews, observations, and surveys/questionnaires, as well as information systems analysis and design methods using Object Oriented approach with Unified Process and system modeling using Unified Modeling Language. Through an understanding of the radiology workflow and analysis of current system in operation, we will build a model of a web-based Radiology Information System which is integrated with radio diagnostic imaging modalities. Utilization of web-based radiology information system integrated with radio diagnostic imaging modality will optimize workflow in radiology department to become leaner. In addition, the results of the examination can be managed easily, reported correctly, and archived better. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

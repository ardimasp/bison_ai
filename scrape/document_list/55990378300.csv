People with obesity has higher risk for several serious health complications and on a larger scale, this could bring negative implications for economic growth and human wellbeing of a nation. Many studies have been conducted to overcome this issue and some suggested that regular self weighing could promote weight loss and weight maintenance. Based on those findings, a body weight tracking system is made as an approach from technological side. The purpose of this system is to raise health awareness by using easy-to-use technology to monitor user weight from time to time. The system consists of a realtime database, a smartphone application, and a modified digital weight scale. The weight scale is tested to have more than 99% accuracy and can active for estimated 40 hours of usage, while the realtime database storage for this implementation is adequate for more than half a million users. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","IoT; obesity; realtime database; weight tracking","Anthropometry; Database systems; Economics; Health risks; Internet of things; Nutrition; Tracking (position); Economic growths; Health awareness; Health complications; Human wellbeing; obesity; Real-time database; Smart-phone applications; Weight maintenance; Scales (weighing instruments)",,,,"Binus University","This project is financially supported by Binus University.","(2018) Potret Sehat Indonesia Dari Riskesdas 2018, , http://www.depkes.go.id/article/view/18110200003/potret-sehat-indonesia-dari-riskesdas-2018.html, Biro Komunikasi dan Pelayanan Masyarakat Kementrian Kesehatan RI Kementerian Kesehatan Republik Indonesia, 2 November [Online] [Accessed 1 1 2019]; Ng, M., Fleming, T., Robinson, M., Global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980-2013: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (2014) Lancet, 384 (9945), pp. 766-781; Litbangkes, B., Depkes, R.I., (2018) Riset Kesehatan Dasar (Riskesdas); Rachmi, C.N., Li, M., Baur, L.A., Overweight and obesity in Indonesia: Prevalence and risk factors - A literature review (2017) Elsevier, 147, pp. 20-29; Rizkiriani, A., Khomsan, A., Riyadi, H., Obesity and Hypertension among Adolescents in Jakarta, Indonesia (2014) Pakistan Journal of Nutrition, 13 (1), pp. 17-21; Mihardja, L., Soetrisno, U., Prevalence and Determinant Factors for Overweight and Obesity and Degenerative Diseases among Young Adults in Indonesia (2012) Journal of the ASEAN Federation of Endocrine Societies, 27 (1), pp. 77-81; Weisell, R.C., Body mass index as an indicator of obesity (2002) Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 11 (S8), pp. S681-684; (2011) Pedoman Praktis Memantau Status Gizi Orang Dewasa, , http://gizi.depkes.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ped-praktis-stat-gizi-dewasa.doc, Kemenkes RI Kementerian Kesehatan Republik Indonesia, 10 [Online] [Accessed 1 1 2019]; Vanwormer, J.J., French, S.A., Pereira, M.A., Welsh, E.M., The Impact of Regular Self-weighing on Weight Management: A Systematic Literature Review (2008) International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, 5; Chin, S.O., Keum, C., Woo, J., Park, J., Choi, H.J., Woo, J.-T., Rhee, S.Y., Successful weight reduction and maintenance by using a smartphone application in those with overweight and obesity (2016) Scientific Reports, pp. 1-8; Remax Smart Digital Bluetooth BMI Body Scale RT-S1, , https://remaxsa.co.za/product/remax-smart-digital-bluetooth-bmi-body-scale-rt-s1/, Remax Remax, [Online] [Accessed 30 September 2019]; Mi Smart Scale, , https://www.mi.com/global/scale/specs, Xiaomi Xiaomi, [Online] [Accessed 30 September 2019]; (2019) Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, , https://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/childhood_what/en/, World Health Organization World Health Organization [Online] [Accessed 30 August 2019]; Mass and Hanger Set, , https://www.pasco.com/file_downloads/Downloads_Manuals/Mass-and-Hanger-Set-Manual-ME-8979.pdf, PASCO [Online] [Accessed 28 09 2019]","Mae, J.; Computer Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: johannes@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

However, the tracking system must deal with two main constraints; real-time computation and limited computing power. Among various efforts, a road side detection is an alternative to provide road tracking. However, dealing road side detection with those constraints is still challenging. Therefore, this paper proposes a simple road side detection and tracking which is adequate for low cost embedded PC. Mainly, the road appearance has different texture to the road side. An algorithm is developed by searching the changing texture from the center to the road side. Here, this paper observes road existence about half part of road appearance on image. Which is about 10 ~ 14m ahead. It depends on perspective appearance of hardware setup. This interested region is observed horizontally on certain consecutive distance. Later, projection on image plane of each corresponding distance are observed for changing texture. The proposed method is evaluated within the first 500 consecutive image frames from the starting time on moving car. Four trials with different tracks are considered for evaluation. The algorithm was successfully run with 640x480 image resolution on raspberry Pi with accuracy 87%. The image was taken with 15fps and the computation for road detection was not more than 10ms. © 2018 IEEE.","Detection; Embedded PC; Road side; Tracking","Error detection; Image resolution; Motion control; Surface discharges; Computing power; Consecutive images; Detection and tracking; Embedded PCs; Interested regions; Real-time computations; Road detection; Tracking system; Roads and streets",,,,,,"Niijima, S., Nitta, J., Sasaki, Y., Mizoguchi, H., Generating 3D fundamental map by large-scale SLAM and graph-based optimization focused on road center line (2017) Proc. of Int.

The concepts implemented in this robot are differential drive control, obstacle avoidance, environmental sensing, and electronic circuit design. The sensors used in the robot are PING ultrasonic sensor, infrared ranger, digital compass, and UVTron flame sensor. The robot is being controlled by AVR ATMega128 16 MIPS and is designed according to the rules laid down by, and to compete in the Indonesia Intelligent Robot Contest (KRCI) in 2012. Before the contest, the robot is tested to solve the maze problem and the result shows that the fastest time needed for robot to extinguish the fire and return to its starting point is 48.46 seconds and the false reading has been reduced as high as 99% compared to the previous design [1]. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Fire-fighting robot; Infrared sensor; KRCI; Modified line-maze algoritm; Ultrasonic sensor; UV sensor",,,,,,,"Shuwanto, F., Frederick, Stefen, (2010) Mobile Robot Navigation Using Depth First Search Algorithm, , http://library.binus.ac.id, Retrieved Oct 1, 2011, from e-thesis; (2009) DIKTI, , http://dikti.go.id/index.php?option=com-content&view=article&id= 253:kontes-robot-indonesia-kri-dan-kontes-robotcerdas-indonesia-krci- 2009&catid=143:berita-harian, Irwandi.

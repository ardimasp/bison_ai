The PHP programming language has many frameworks. Most available frameworks are open source and have their advantages and disadvantages. Among the PHP frameworks that are widely used there are two very popular and frequently used frameworks, namely Laravel and CodeIgniter. Because both of these frameworks have an easier, neat system development process and their security is guaranteed.

XYZ is a vehicle automotive retail company that already has 26 branches spread across major cities and has more than 150 salesmen. The marketing positions consist of 5 levels, from salesman, supervisors, branch heads, area managers to marketing directors. One of the tasks of the marketing director is to set a five-level selling price level and determine the promotion of all products from PT. XYZ the number of customers from PT. XYZ currently is around 12, 500 consisting of wholesalers, shops, workshops, companies and factories. Competition in the automotive world is very tight. Field salesman who are already equipped with price strata and promotions sometimes have difficulty in the field where competitors can quickly change their selling prices, provide attractive discounts or promotions to existing customers. According to interviews with salesmen in the field, making decisions about prices, discounts and promotions takes an average of 2 to 3 days, so that the potential loss of orders and even loss of customers can occur at any time. and according to data obtained on average every salesman loses 3 to 5 orders every month, this is because the long chain of communication at PT. XYZ in addition to selling prices and promotions. Salesman must be responsive to the needs and complaints from customers. Therefore, we need a Marketing Intelligence System with Business Intelligence support to be able to support salesman operations in the field more efficiently and effectively. The research method used is to start with data collection by conducting interviews, design applications in accordance with the findings and results of the analysis and the final step is followed by the design of the data house and dashboard for marketing. © 2020 IEEE.","Business intelligence; Marketing intelligence; Operations","Commerce; Costs; Information analysis; Information management; Automotive world; Data collection; Design applications; Making decision; Marketing intelligences; Operational activity; Potential loss; research methods; Sales",,,,,"Aaker, D.A., (2019) Marketing Research, , 13rd ed John Wiley & Sons; Siemieniako, D., (2016) B2B Relationship Marketing Management in Trade Fair Activity, , Cambridge Scholars Publishing; West, D.C., (2015) Strategic Marketing: Creating Competitive Advantage, , Oxford University Press; Blokdyk, G., (2020) Business Intelligence 2. 0 A Complete Guide, , Emereo Pty Limited; Blokdyk, G., (2020) Mobile Business Intelligence A Complete Guide, , Emereo Pty Limited; Blokdyk, G., (2019) Business Intelligence and Analytics in Small and Medium Enterprises, , CRC Press; Blokdyk, G., (2020) Data Warehouse Automation A Complete Guide, , Emereo Pty Limited; Cao, H., Li, J., Wang, R., (2016) Trends and Applications in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, , Springer; Hoffer, J.A., Venkataraman, R., Topi, H., (2016) Modern Database Management, , 12th Ed Pearson; Kotler, P., (2015) Marketing Management, , 15th Ed.

The application of Knowledge Management is also widely used to improve the quality of human resources. Especially for the type of industry that requires high HR capabilities where the individual capabilities of its HR are very influential to the results of the quality of its products. The purpose of this study is to provide a solution to the problems faced by PT. GAI, especially in the production section where the knowledge and ability of cutting, installation, repair of window film on the car are not evenly distributed in all existing HR, including the absorption of knowledge on new types of cars. The method used is Knowledge Spiral Model (SECI Model) from Nonaka and Takeuchi where there are 4 stages of the process, namely socialization, externalization, combination and internalization are needed PT. GAI for enhancing their HR capability. The results of the analysis show that PT GAI is a company that is rich in knowledge, but less well-organized need to build KM application to enables organization sustainability and strengthening their organizational human resources. Therefore, it is necessary to have a good Knowledge Management System to enable organization learning, where all employees can share and put their knowledge and look for what they want in the system. This study aims to identify the application of Knowledge Management carried out by industrial companies that require high HR capabilities. This can be done if you want to apply knowledge management more broadly. Certainly, it will provide greater benefits to the world of industry in the future. © 2019 IEEE.","HR; knowledge; knowledge management; quality improvement","Human resource management; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Industrial companies; knowledge; Knowledge management system; Organization learning; Private companies; Quality improvement; Spiral models; Window film; Knowledge management",,,,,"Koenig, M.E.D., (2012) What Is KM?

In this condition, the user may not find theinformation or wasting time to search the correct informationaccording to their needs. The Knowledge Management System isdeveloped to answer the needs to find the data with efficient, reliable, and trust.

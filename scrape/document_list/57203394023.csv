The case study taken place in Indonesia popular cement board finished goods warehouse. The objectives of this study are to reduce overtime, by re-layout of warehouse finished goods using integrated methods. The integrated of Class-Based Storage Method, Dedicated Storage Policy, From-to-Chart Method for layout improvement and Tibrewala, Philippe, and Browne Algorithm for scheduling warehouse operators. The results of relayout the finished goods warehouse are obtained that the space efficiency and the reduction of cycle time from 3,33 minutes to 1,86 minutes and the overtime hours decreased after partial implementation. The result obtained for the new labor scheduling of warehouse operator is needed to reduce 2 operators. The proposed improvement will continue to be applied and it is expected to increase efficiency in the future. © IEOM Society International.","And Browne algorithm; Class-based storage; Cycle time; Dedicated storage; From-to-chart; Philippe; Tibrewala",,,,,,"Larson, A heuristic approach to warehouse layout with class-based storage (1997) IIE Transactions, 29, pp. 337-348; Zaerpour, N., de Koster, R.B.M., Yu, Y., Storage policies and optimal shape of a storage system (2013) International Journal of Production Research, 51 (23-24), pp. 6891-6899; Guo, X., Storage Policies and Maintenance Support Strategies in Warehousing Systems (2016) Springer Science + Business Media Singapore; Aminia, E.F., Rahman, A., Mada, C.F., Penjadwalan Tenaga Kerja Tiga Shift Berkendala Libur Hari Minggu dan Satu Hari Setelah Shift Tiga (2013) Jurnal Rekayasadan Manajemen Sistem Industri, 1; Indeks Harga Perdagangan Besar Bahan Bangunan/Konstruksi Indonesia, 2002-2017, , https://www.bps.go.id/linkTabelStatis/view/id/1458, Retrieved from Badan Pusat Statistik 2017, April 3; Freivalds, A., Niebel, B., (2009) Niebel's Methods, , Standards, and Work Design 12th Edition USA: McGraw Hill International Edition; Heragu, S.S., (2016) Facilities Design, , 4th Edition.

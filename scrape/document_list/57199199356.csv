In the midst of intense competition with vegetable oil producing countries in the world, Indonesia must have international competitiveness which is strongly supported by the technology in order to achieve a sustained competitive advantage. The major purpose of this paper is to examine the direct effect of technological resources to international competitiveness and sustained competitive advantage as well as measure the mediating effect of international competitiveness in the relationship between technological resources and sustained competitive advantage. For these purposes, an empirical survey was conducted with the active participation of 82 palm oil industries in Indonesia. In addition to the survey, in-depth interviews were conducted to follow up the quantitative results. On the basis of path analysis with SmartPLS, technology resources had positive and significant effect to sustained competitive advantage. This study suggests the importance of technological resources in achieving sustained competitive advantage on the part of palm oil industries in developing countries. © IAEME Publication.","Indonesia;

This agricultural commodity has become a chief Indonesian foreign exchange earner behind fossil fuel exports. In 2016, the export value of this commodity reached USD 17.8 billion. Historically, Malaysia has been more advanced in the CPO delivery, which can be explained by the general companies'environment of management, technological advancement and engineering, human resource skills and superior external support, such as road infrastructure, regulations and research& development by the industry and government. It is clear from data that the Indonesian production is disadvantaged by a wide range of inefficiencies. They range from limited technology and production management skills to limitedcultivation advancement. Applications of technical improvements are desired to enhance the national competitive advantage to the next level. This paper is an exploration of the current management culture and to consider a strategic management model that would be the most appropriate for Indonesia and would enourage high end technology and plantation management. A gradual level improvement would enable Indonesia to compete on a global scale as an industry leader in the palm oil market. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agriculture; Competition; Fossil fuels; Human resource management; Management science; Oil shale; Research and development management; Agricultural commodities; Competitive advantage; Human resource skills; National competitive advantages; Plantation managements; Production management; Technical improvement; Technological advancement; Palm oil",,,,,"Porter, M., (1990) The Competitive Advantage of Nations, , (New York: The Free Press); Basiron, Y., Chan-Cook, W., The Oil Palm and Its Sustainability (2004) Journal of Palm Oil Research, 16, pp. 1-10; Bruno L (2016). http:// www.ehs.org. uk/press/ the-palm- oil-industry- Technological- change-global- competition-social- And-environmental- impact. accessed 27 5 2017; Basiron, Y., (2007) Eur.

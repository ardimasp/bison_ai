However, it is still a challenging problem in computer vision. The appearance of an object is affected by variations in illumination, viewpoint and occlusion. In this contribution, we propose an object instance recognition method based on Best Increasing Subsequence. It estimates a set of geometrically consistent feature pairs and at the same time, maximizes the total similarity score between test and train images. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing geometric verification methods, RANSAC Homography and Weighted LIS. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Geometric verifications; Homographies; Recognition methods; Scene understanding; Similarity scores; Human computer interaction",,,,,"Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 25, pp. 1097-1105. , http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf, F.

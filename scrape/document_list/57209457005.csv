Due to the many kyara, many ways are used by authors of Japanese fiction. One of the ways is by putting a catch phrase at the end of a dialog in a kyara. This kind of catch phrase is called kyaragobi. The method that is used in this research is qualitative method combined with descriptive analysis. The purpose of the research is to prove that kyaragobi to be more than just a catch phrase, but instead as a more significant supporting element to an identity of a kyaragobi's distinctive character, especially in digital era. Based on the analysed questionnaires, kyaragobi gives a different representation related to the catch phrase of a kyara. By using a kyaragobi, an identity of a kyara becomes more distinctive compared to other similar kyaras. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Physics; Descriptive analysis; Digital era; Qualitative method; Surveys",,,,"Binus University","This research paper was funded by the research grant from Bina Nusantara University","Dharma, H., (2015) Perbedaan Penulisan Dalam Manga Gaya Bahasa Lama-Baru Berkaitan Dengan Penggunaan Yakuwarigo Dan Kyaragobi, pp. 110-111. , (Depok: Universitas Indonesia); Hiroyuki, A., (2011) Japan Kingdom of Characters, p. 3. , (Tokyo: Insho-sha); Kinsui, S., (2003) Vacharu Nihongo: Yakuwarigo No Nazo, p. 205. , (Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten); Kinsui, S., (2013) Nihon Kenkyuu Dai Juu Yon - Kyarakutaa to ""douissei"", p. 5. , (Osaka: Osaka University); Sadanobu, T., (2007) Kyarajoshi Ga Arawareru Kankyou, pp. 34-35. , (Tokyo: Kurosio); Sadanobu, T., Characters (2015) Japanese Communication and Language: An Overview Acta Linguistica Asiatica, 5, pp. 10-11; Tuskamoto, A., (2007) Character and Japanese Reason to Need Character Animated Cartoon Character, p. 4. , (Tokyo: Tokyo University)",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Advance and Scientific Innovation, ICASI 2018","23 April 2018 through 24 April 2018",,148653,17426588,,,,"English","J.

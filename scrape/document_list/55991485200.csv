It makes research on computer science domain become more and more interesting to be done. Pure and applied research conducted to develop and enrich the knowledge of computer science. Interest of researchers in conducting research in the field of computer science led to a need to know the trend of computer science research topics in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to predict trends to know what are the research topics related to computer science. The extreme learning machine (ELM) is a new artificial neural network method. ELM learning methods designed to overcome the weaknesses of feedforward neural networks, especially in terms of learning speed. This method has the advantage of producing a good generalization performance. This study implements ELM to predict trends in computer science research topics and to analyze the accuracy in predicting the ELM. The results of this study showed that prediction research topics using ELM has a high accuracy with average precision 0.7782 for up rend topics prediction and 0.8954 for down trend topics prediction. The best numbers of input used for prediction in this study are 6 units. ELM performance in terms of speed is better than the performance of linear prediction and backpropagation. ELM performance in terms of testing accuracy is better than the performance of linear prediction and backpropagation. Predicted results using the ELM shows that in 2013 the uptrend topics are: ""Intelligent Web Services and Semantic Web"", ""Ubiquitous Computing"", and ""Web Search"". © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Computer science; Extreme learning machine; Prediction; Trend",,,,,,"Kobayashi, S., (2005) Technology Trends Analysis from the Internet Resources, , Springer; Small, H., Tracking and predicting growth areas in science (2006) Akadémiai Kiad; Endang, S., Rahayu, R., Hasibuan, Z.A., Identification of technology trend on indonesian patent documents and research reports on chemistry and metallurgy fields (2006) Asia-Pacific Conference on Library & Information Education & Practice, , Singapore; Sun, Z.L., Choi, T.M., Au, K.F., Yu, Y., Sales forecasting using extreme learning machine with application in fashion retailing (2008) Elsevier Decision Support Systems, 46, pp. 411-419; Agustina, I.D., Anggraeni, W., Mukhlason, A., (2010) Penerapan Metode Extreme Learning Machine Untuk Peramalan, , ITS Library; Comer, D.E., Computing as a discipline (1989) Communications of the ACM, 32; IEEE Computer Society, , http://www.computer.org/portal/web/publications/acmtaxonomy, Online; Vercellis, C., (2009) Business Intelligence: Data Mining and Optimization for Decision Making, , Chennai: John Wiley & Sons; Singh, R., Balasundaram, S., Application of extreme learning machine method for time series analysis (2007) World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology; Huang, G.B., Zhu, Q.Y., Siew, C.K., Extreme learning machine : Theory and applications (2006) Elsevier Science : Neurocomputing, 70, pp. 489-501; El-Sebakhy, E.A., Extreme learning machine as a new framework in predicting material properties: Methodology and novita sari et al./procedia engineering 50 ( 2012 ) 871 - 881 881 comparison (2008) The 12th International Conference of International Association for Computer Methods and Advances in Geomechanics, , Goa, Indoa; Tsung, Y.O., Chen, F.L., Constructing a sales forecasting model by integrating gra and elm : A case study for retail industry (2011) International Journal of Electronic Business Management, pp. 107-121; Duan, G., Huang, Z., Wang, J., (2009) Extreme Learning Machine for Bank Clients Classification, , IEEE; Huang, G.B., Wang, D.H., Lan, Y., (2011) Extreme Learning Machines: A Survey, pp. 107-122. , Springer; Keith, J., Sandy, O., Balkina, D., Automatic neural network modeling for univariate time series (2000) Elsevier, No. International Journal of Forecasting; Ziegle, B., (2009) Methods for Bibliometric Analysis of Research: Renewable Energy Case Study, , Cambridge; Zhu, M., (2004) Recall, Precision and Average Precision, , Canada; http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/egbhuang/, Online","Bina Nusantara University, Jl.

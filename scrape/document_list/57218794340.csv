The aim is to suggest which combination is deemed suitable for a certain business requirement based on a real study case. There are various studies and research on comparing the performance of how one configuration could affect the total performance with a certain metrics they want to measure. But currently there are no works of study of assessing how does each parameter tuning would affect the backup performance on Oracle database, since it is only categorized on high-level language (basic, high, low, medium). This study would use the data and requirement from one of the largest government-based company in Indonesia using Oracle backup tools: RMAN. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

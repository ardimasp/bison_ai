Resistance Spot Welding (RSW) is a process widely used in the industrial, mostly in the automotive industry. RSW is used to joint two or more materials in order to form the structure of the car. Resistance spot welding requires parameters that play as an important role in the welding process. There are three important parameters in the welding process, namely welding current (kA), welding time (cycle), and electrode force (kN). All three parameters should be optimized in order to produce high quality spot weld joints and less welding defects. In relation to Green Manufacturing, less defects means less waste and less consumption of materials. In the present study, we utilized RSM (Response Surface Method) to optimize the parameters by using statistical and mathematical techniques to analyze the problem. Optimal result parameters on welding current 8.7 kA, welding time 19,25 cycle, and electrode force 1,6 kN with diameter nugget 6,969 mm. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The company is experiencing low performance in the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) metric. The OEE of the company machines are below world class standard. The machine that has the lowest OEE is the filler machine. Through observation and analysis, it is found that the cleaning process of the filler machine consumes significant amount of time. The long duration of the cleaning process happens because there is no structured division of jobs between cleaning operators, differences in operators' ability, and operators' inability in utilizing available cleaning equipment. The company needs to improve the cleaning process. Therefore, Critical Path Method (CPM) analysis is conducted to find out what activities are critical in order to shorten and simplify the cleaning process in the division of tasks. Afterwards, The Maynard Operation and Sequence Technique (MOST) method is used to reduce ineffective movement and specify the cleaning process standard time. From CPM and MOST, it is obtained the shortest time of the cleaning process is 1 hour 28 minutes and the standard time is 1 hour 38.826 minutes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Equipment, devices and apparatus; Fillers; Turnaround time; Cleaning equipments; Cleaning process; Critical path method; Long duration; Overall equipment effectiveness; Pharmaceutical company; Production process; Standard time; Cleaning",,,,,,"Frost, Industrial Automation Practice, S., (2005) Improving Plant Performan Overall Equipment Effectiveness, , (Frost & Sullivan); Karad, A.A., Waychale, N.K., Tidke, N.G., (2016) Int.

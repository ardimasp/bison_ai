The phenomenon of the development of peer-to-peer lending fintech companies in Indonesia is supported by the increasing demand of consumers. The research objective is to provide insight into the determinants of consumer interest in using fintech applications, using the technology acceptance model by added e-trust variables . The data analysis method used structural equation modeling with WarpPLS 6.0 software. Questionnaires were distributed to fintech consumers in Indonesia, with a total sample of 379 respondents. The results of this study indicate that the dimensions of e-trust contribute to determining the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude to adopt peer-to-peer lending fintech services, and intention to use peer-to-peer lending applications. © 2020.

This is in view of the condition that there is still a scarcity of research on the use of social media: LinkedIn, which is already a favorite as a media e-recruitment tool in previous studies. LinkedIn is also used by users as a tool to enhance the network of professionals that follows the rapid development of information technology. This research uses the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) approach as a research framework and its modification based on previous research, uses a sampling technique called non-probability purposive sampling collected 335 respondents. The collected data is processed by using SmartPLS ver 2.0. Data analysis in this research is descriptive statistical analysis and inferential analysis with PLS or Partial Least Square approach. This analysis is a Multivariate SEM analysis. Based on the results of this research concluded that LinkedIn's social Media acceptability in Indonesia has a positive response towards its users where there is a significant relationship for Ease of Use (EU), Critical Mass (CM), Capability (CP) and Trustworthiness (TW) towards continuity of use of the LinkedIn application. This LinkedIn can continue to be used as a platform to improve the professional network for its users. Trustworthiness (TW) is a variable in which respondents to be trusted to this application. It found that Indonesian people were open to disclose their education and work history to the public, without fear of being abused by third parties. Whereas Perceived Playfulness (PP) showed no significance for using LinkedIn. It is understandable that Social Media: LinkedIn is a professional network, which is indeed used for professional purposes. © 2020 IJSTR.","Intention to Use; LinkedIn; Social Media; Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)",,,,,,"(2017) Penetrasi & Profil Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia, , https://web.kominfo.go.id/sites/default/files/LaporanSurveiAPJII_2017_v1.3.pdf; Cornell, R.M., Eining, M.M., Hu, P.J.-H., The Effects of Process Accountability on Individuals‘ Use of a Familiar Technology (2011) Journal of Information Systems, , https://doi.org/10.2308/jis.2011.25.1.109; Fakhoury, R., Aubert, B., Citizenship, trust, and behavioural intentions to use public e-services: The case of Lebanon (2015) International Journal of Information Management, 35 (3), pp. 346-351. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2015.02.002; Fitriyani, A., Sfenrianto, S., Wang, G., Susanto, A., Examining the Security Issues of Automated Teller Machine Based on Revised Technology Acceptance Model (2017) TELKOMNIKA (Telecommunication Computing Electronics and Control), 14 (4), p. 1521. , https://doi.org/10.12928/telkomnika.v14i4.2920; Garg, R., Telang, R., To Be or Not To Be Linked on LinkedIn: Job Search Using Online Social Networks (2012) SSRN Electronic Journal.; Guillory, J., Hancock, J.T., The effect of linkedin on deception in resumes (2012) Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, , https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2011.0389; Hair, J.F., Ringle, C.M., Sarstedt, M., PLS-SEM: Indeed a silver bullet (2011) Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice, , https://doi.org/10.2753/MTP1069-6679190202; Khan, N.R., Awang, M., Ghouri, A.M., IMPACT OF E-RECRUITMENT AND JOB-SEEKERS PERCEPTION ON INTENTION TO PURSUE THE JOBS (2013) Management & Marketing; Koch, T., Gerber, C., de Klerk, J.J., The impact of social media on recruitment: Are you LinkedIn?

One form of TELs, that is on-screen learning, has become the topic of interest of many works. It is popular mainly with young people despite all findings, which undoubtedly suggest that it is detrimental to learning. The method hinders learning experience due to the reading spatial instability, difficulties in establishing mental map, and poor visual ergonomics. Currently, many textbooks are available in electronic form and a majority of the students in Bina Nusantara University in Indonesia, for example, consider the form to be more convenient and preferable. In the electronic form, the textbooks are much more affordable. They can be obtained easier than the printed books. This work intends to explore a method of improving the learning quality of the electronic textbooks. The improvement is expected to be achieved by enriching the electronic textbook with cues in the form of margin notes, highlights, markers, lines and arrows, and navigation tools provided by the subject matter expert. The idea is implemented on a class at the university and its effects are assessed. The participants are divided into two groups having the same distribution of the past academic performance where one group is assigned to learn using the recommendation system and the other is without the system. After the learning, their understandings are assessed systematically by qualitative and quantitative methods. The participants with the recommendation system outperform those without significantly, which is marked by the values of the Cohen’s effect size d larger than 1.20 with the standard deviation about 0.563. © 2017 IEEE.",,,,,,,"Wertsch, J.V., Commentary on: Deliberation with computers: Exploring the distinctive contribution of new technologies to collaborative thinking and learning (2003) International Journal of Educational Research, 39 (8), pp. 899-904. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035504001028, deliberation with computers: exploring the distinctive contribution of new technologies to collaborative thinking and learning; Manouselis, N., Drachsler, H., Vuorikari, R., Hummel, H., Koper, R., Recommender systems in technology enhanced learning (2011) Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 387-415. , Springer; Eklundh, K.S., Problems in achieving a global perspective of the text in computer-based writing (1992) Instructional Science, 21 (1), pp. 73-84; Baccino, T., Pynte, J., Spatial coding and discourse models during text reading (2004) Language and Cognitive Processes, 9, pp. 143-155; Piolat, A., Roussey, J.Y., Thunin, O., Effects of screen presepresent on text reading revising (1997) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 47 (4), pp. 565-589; Mangen, A., Walgermo, B.R., Bronnick, K., Reading linear text on paper versus computer screen: Effects on reading comprehension (2013) International Journal of Educational Research, 58, pp. 61-68; Ackerman, R., Goldsmith, M., Megacognitive regulation of text learning: On screen versus on paper (2011) Journal of Experimental Phsychology: Applied, 17 (1), pp. 18-32; Garland, K.J., Noyes, J.M., Crt monitors: Do they intefere with learning?

This study intends to develop such the capability on the basis of the data of the brain waves: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. For the purpose, a number of participants are asked to participate in the study where their brain waves are recorded by using a low-cost Neurosky Mindwave EEG sensor. In the process, the participants are performing a continuous performance test from which their attention levels are directly measured in the form of the response time in conjunction to those waves. When the response time is much longer than a normal one, the participant attention is assumed to be dropped. A simple k-NN classification method is used with the k = 3. The results are the following. The best detection of the attention drop is achieved when the attention features are extracted from the earliest stage of the brain wave signals. The brain wave signal should be recorded longer than 1 s since the time the stimulus is presented as a short signal leads to a poor categorization. A significant drop in the level of response time is required to provide the brain signal that better predicts the change of the attention. © 2017 IEEE.",,,,,,,"Bassili, J.N., Emotion recognition: The role of facial movement and the relative importance of upper and lower areas of the face (1979) American Psychological Association, 37 (11), p. 2049; Marouane, S., Najlaa, S., Abderrahim, T., Eddine, E.K., Towards measuring learners concentration in e-learning systems (2015) International Journal of Computer Techniques, 2 (5), pp. 27-29; Hindarto, H., Sumarmo, S., Feature extraction of electroencephalography signals using fast fourier transform (2016) Commit (Communication & Information Technology) Journal, 10 (1), pp. 49-52; Busso, C., Deng, Z., Yildirim, S., Bulut, M., Lee, C.M., Kazemzadeh, A., Lee, S., Narayanan, S., Analysis of emotion recognition using facial expressions, speech and multimodal information (2004) In Proceedings of the 6Th International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces.

Many students fully rely on the slides as the main learning materials and, in some cases, substituting textbooks. This study intends to understand how students interact with the learning materials presented on Powerpoint slides. The interaction is measured using an eye tracker device called the Eye Tribe Tracker. Thirty sophomore and junior students are asked to participate. They are instructed to learn a topic in the subject of Introduction to Algorithm and Programming, a basic course in the computer science field. During the process, their fixation points are monitored and are related to the contents on the slides. The results are rather surprising.

One form of TELs, that is on-screen learning, has become the topic of interest of many works. It is popular mainly with young people despite all findings, which undoubtedly suggest that it is detrimental to learning. The method hinders learning experience due to the reading spatial instability, difficulties in establishing mental map, and poor visual ergonomics. Currently, many textbooks are available in electronic form and a majority of the students in Bina Nusantara University in Indonesia, for example, consider the form to be more convenient and preferable. In the electronic form, the textbooks are much more affordable. They can be obtained easier than the printed books. This work intends to explore a method of improving the learning quality of the electronic textbooks. The improvement is expected to be achieved by enriching the electronic textbook with cues in the form of margin notes, highlights, markers, lines and arrows, and navigation tools provided by the subject matter expert. The idea is implemented on a class at the university and its effects are assessed. The participants are divided into two groups having the same distribution of the past academic performance where one group is assigned to learn using the recommendation system and the other is without the system. After the learning, their understandings are assessed systematically by qualitative and quantitative methods. The participants with the recommendation system outperform those without significantly, which is marked by the values of the Cohen’s effect size d larger than 1.20 with the standard deviation about 0.563. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

This study intends to develop such the capability on the basis of the data of the brain waves: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. For the purpose, a number of participants are asked to participate in the study where their brain waves are recorded by using a low-cost Neurosky Mindwave EEG sensor. In the process, the participants are performing a continuous performance test from which their attention levels are directly measured in the form of the response time in conjunction to those waves. When the response time is much longer than a normal one, the participant attention is assumed to be dropped. A simple k-NN classification method is used with the k = 3. The results are the following. The best detection of the attention drop is achieved when the attention features are extracted from the earliest stage of the brain wave signals. The brain wave signal should be recorded longer than 1 s since the time the stimulus is presented as a short signal leads to a poor categorization. A significant drop in the level of response time is required to provide the brain signal that better predicts the change of the attention. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Many students fully rely on the slides as the main learning materials and, in some cases, substituting textbooks. This study intends to understand how students interact with the learning materials presented on Powerpoint slides. The interaction is measured using an eye tracker device called the Eye Tribe Tracker. Thirty sophomore and junior students are asked to participate. They are instructed to learn a topic in the subject of Introduction to Algorithm and Programming, a basic course in the computer science field. During the process, their fixation points are monitored and are related to the contents on the slides. The results are rather surprising.

Because the pervasiveness of the problem scale, it may only be tamed effectively and efficiently by using an automatic grooming conversation detection system. Previously, Pranoto, Gunawan, and Soewito [1] had developed a logistic model for the purpose and the model was able to achieve 95% detection accuracy. The current study intends to address the issue by using Support Vector Machine and fc-nearest neighbors classifiers. In addition, the study also proposes a low-computational cost classification method on the basis of the number of the existing grooming conversation characteristics. All proposed methods are evaluated using 150 conversation texts of which 105 texts are grooming and 45 texts are non-grooming. We identify that grooming conversations possess 17 features of grooming characteristics. The results suggest that the SVM and fc-NN are able to identify grooming conversations at 98.6% and 97.8% of the level of accuracy. Meanwhile, the proposed simple method has 96.8% accuracy. The empirical study also suggests that two among the seventeen characteristics are insignificant for the classification. © 2016 IEEE.","Grooming Classifier; k-nearest Neighbors; Online Child Grooming; Support Vector Machine","Nearest neighbor search; Support vector machines; Classification methods; Computational costs; Detection accuracy; Detection system; Empirical studies; K-nearest neighbors; Nearest neighbors; Online Child Grooming; Computer crime",,,,,"Pranoto, H., Gunawan, F.E., Soewito, B., Logistic models for classifying online grooming conversation (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 357-365. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915020657; Olson, L.N., Daggs, J.L., Ellevold, B.L., Rogers, T.K., Entrap-ping the innocent: Toward a theory of child sexual predators luring communication (2007) Communication Theory, 17 (3), pp. 231-251; Whittle, H., Hamilton-Giachritsis, C., Beech, A., Collings, G., A review of online grooming: Characteristics and concerns (2013) Aggression and Violent Behavior, 18 (1), pp. 62-70; Soewito, B., Isa, S.M., Digital technology: The effect on connected world to computer ethic and family (2015) CommIT (Communication and Information Technology).

The performance of such system strongly depends on its feature extraction methods. So far, many extraction methods have independently been studied and proposed, and the three widely adopted methods are Geometric Moment Invariant (GMI), United Moment Invariant (UMI), and Zernike Moment Invariant (ZMI). This study is performed to understand the relative performance of the three methods. For this purpose, the methods, in conjunction with Support Vector Machine classifier with RBF, and PuK kernels, are used to recognize characters taken from Char75K dataset. In addition, the combined features of GMI-UMI, GMI-ZMI, UMI-ZMI, and GMI-UMI-ZMI are also studied. The numerical results suggest the following. Among the three extraction methods, GMI, UMI, and ZMI methods, the latter two methods tend to provide better results by about 7-8% than the GMI method. Generally, when the features are combined, the results improve rather significant, about 7-8% improvement. Only the pair of GMI and UMI combination provide small or negligible improvement. Using the RBF kernel, GMI features alone result in 63% accuracy, UMI features alone 70% accuracy, and GMI-UMI combination result in 72% accuracy.

In the United States, the disease is the leading cause of death for people of most ethnicity. In Indonesia, the disease contributes 17% of the total mortality. It is also well-known that a regular or continuous monitoring the heart rate is important to minimize the fatality. At the current technological state, the monitoring method is expensive and often requires wearable sensor, which is inconvenient. This study intends to establish a relationship between the heart rate and speech signals empirically by using a regression and correlation analysis. The speech signals are analyzed through a frequency analysis using fast Fourier transformation. The results suggest that vowel 'e' speech signal has a strong correlation to the heart rate. © 2016 IEEE.","Fast Fourier Transform; Heart Rate; Vowel Speech Signals","Audio signal processing; Fast Fourier transforms; Linguistics; Monitoring; Pathology; Speech; Speech communication; Continuous monitoring; Correlation analysis; Empirical relations; Fast Fourier transformations; Heart rates; Monitoring methods; Speech signals; Strong correlation; Heart",,,,,"Zennifa, F., Kamil, H., Iramina, K., Prototype early warning system for heart disease detection using android application (2014) The 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC), pp. 3468-3471. , IEEE; Duc, L., (2015) Indonesia: Coronary Heart Disease, , http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/indonesia-coronary-heart-disease, Online.

These are characterized by extraordinary competitive stresses and sophisticated customers who request innovative and rapid solutions. One of these technologies is enterprise resource planning (ERP). Although ERP systems can bring competitive advantage to organizations, the high failure rate is a major concern [1]. It is said that about 70% of ERP implementations fail to deliver anticipated benefits [2]. These present studies identify and examine the role of knowledge in the context of ERP system. There are two variables in this research, where knowledge capability as independent variables and key stakeholders' readiness as moderating variable that impact to the success of ERP implementation. There are 46 respondents giving feedback to this online survey. Based on analysis, the relationship knowledge capability and ERP success having beta coefficient 0.37 and P-value < 0.01. While the result for key stakeholders' readiness can moderate the relationship between knowledge capability and ERP success having beta coefficient = 0.04 and P-value = 0.39. © 2016 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.","Enterprise resource planning; ERP implementation success; Key stakeholders' readiness; Knowledge capability; WarpPLS",,,,,,"Davenport, T.H., Prusak, L., (1998) Working Knowledge: How Organisations Manage What They Know, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, MA; Al-Mashari, M., Zairi, M., The effective application of SAP R/3: A proposed model of best practice (2000) Logistics Information Management, 13, pp. 156-166; Malhotra, R., Temponi, C., Critical decisions for ERP integration: Small business issues (2010) International Journal of Information Management, 30 (1), pp. 28-37; Dantes, G.R., (2006) ERP Implementation and Impact for Human and Organizational Cost, , MS Thesis, Depok, Indonesia; Ehie, I.C., Madsen, M., Identifying critical issues in enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation (2005) Computers in Industry, 56, pp. 545-557; Krigsman, M., (2011) 2011 ERP Survey: New IT Failure Research and Statistics, , http://www.zdnet.com/blog/projectfailures/2011-erp-survey-newit-failure-research-And-statistics/12486, [Online]; Krigsman, M., (2010) ERP failure: New Research and Statistics, , http://www.zdnet.com/blog/projectfailures/erp-failure-new-research-Andstatistics/8253, [Online]; Momoh, A., Roy, R., Shehab, E., Challenges in enterprise resource planning implementation: State-of-The-Art (2010) Business Process Management Journal, 16 (4), pp. 537-565; Al-Mashari, M., Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems: A research agenda (2003) Industrial Management and Data Systems, 103 (1), pp. 22-27; McNurlin, B., Will users of ERP stay satisfied?

Advances in information technology companies make every attempt to improve its internal business processes. To optimize its business processes, companies should not only be oriented to internal processes, but rather an external process that involves a relationship with the companies involved as a business. XYZ Corporation is a company engaged in manufacturing plastic household goods. The resulting products include a variety of bottles (which are used for soap, lotion, shampoo, and ink), bottle caps, cans, mannequin body fit, and others. XYZ is facing problems of a delay in arrival of raw materials, stock-checking errors, and delays in delivery of goods to the customer.

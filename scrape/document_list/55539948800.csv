World Health Organization (WHO) stated in 2014, 8.5% of adults aged 18 years above had diabetes. A mobile application that could help people with diabetes, such as food database, blood sugar levels and reports, is needed. Today, the number of usage and develop of mobile application is getting bigger, and the use of mobile phone/ smartphone users around the world is increasing every year, there are around 2.53 billion users in 2018. 'Diabefood' is the result of the study using android operating system application that can be used for diabetics to record their daily food consumptions to help them measure the blood sugar level and consumptions of insulin by unit daily and provide them the data using graphics daily, weekly, or monthly. The study also aims to help diabetics for the surveillance and control of their disease to increase their life quality and life expectancy. © 2020 IEEE.","Android apps; Diabetes mellitus; Mobile apps","Blood; Disease control; Food supply; Information management; Insulin; Mobile computing; Plants (botany); Blood sugar levels; Chronic disease; Diabetes mellitus; Life expectancies; Life qualities; Mobile applications; World Health Organization; Blood vessels",,,,,,"Cataloguing, W.L., Global report on diabetes (2016) Isbn, 978, pp. 6-86. , http://www.who.int/about/licensing/copyright_form/index.html%0A, http://www. who. int/about/licensing/copyright_form/index. htm l%0A https://apps. who. int/iris/handle/10665/204871%0A http://w ww. who. int/about/licensing/; (2019) Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, 21 (1). , World Health Organization; Sminkey, L., Garwood, P., (2016) World Health Day 2016: More Individuals, Government and Stakeholders Actions to Beat Diabetes, , https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/06-04-2016-world-health-day-2016-who-calls-for-global-action-to-haltrise-in-and-improve-care-for-people-with-diabetes, accessed Apr. 04, 2019; (2018) Economic Costs of Diabetes in the, pp. 1-12. , American Diabetes Association; Putra, A.P., Rahmad, C., Analisa perbandingan metode certainty factor diagnosa penyakit diabetes melitus J.

For building a supervised machine learning to predict cardiovascular disease risk, a best classifier is tested and selected to fit with the model data. In selecting the best classifier model, five classifiers were used to train the data. In this process, each classifier used sixty thousand medical records from Mayapada private hospital for data training and testing. The data was initially divided into 38 attributes. The training model of each classifier was measured and evaluated using classification accuracy, classification error and F-measurement. As a result, Gradient Boosted Trees classifier was selected as the best classifier with the highest accuracy rate more than 80%, F-measure is more than 92% and the classification error is less than 12%. Hence, a backend machine learning API was built based on this Gradient Boosted Trees classifier and it has been tested for training and predicting the cardiovascular disease risk through the Postman application. © 2020 ISSN 1881-803X.","API (Application Programming Interface); Classifier; Supervised machine learning",,,,,,"Acknowledgment.

In order to produce a reliable application, this paper discusses the utilization of a combination from two different testing methods, Test- Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD). TDD testing method is a process with a high percentage of code which is tested automatically. However, it could lead to an error when the parameters of the features are changed. Meanwhile, the BDD testing method is a testing method that could perform successfully despite changes to the parameters of the features. This paper discusses the combination of TDD and BDD testing methods, which is called as T-BDD method. By implementing T-BDD into the Vixio backend system, this paper successfully shows that it could be performed to achieve a high percentage of test-coverage while it could also adapt when the parameters of the features were changed. This paper also shows that the T-BDD testing method performed better compared to using the TDD testing method only. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Interactive fiction shows the potential to improve reading behaviour and engage the player with reading materials. In continuing to explore more benefits in reading, creating, and sharing interactive fiction, a web application called Vixio is developed as a platform, where users can develop and distribute interactive fiction. To engage and to feed the users with more interactive stories, a recommender system is applied to provide recommendations of stories that would be suitable to the reader's interest. This paper is focused on developing a recommender system which can generate personalized story recommendations for the Vixio web application. This paper also discusses determining which techniques are better to be implemented inside the recommender system by conducting a comparative study between five collaborative filtering techniques, which are: Three Matrix Factorizations (SVD, SVD++, and NMF), Slope One, and Co-clustering. To compare each technique with one another, 5-fold cross-validation and response time were measured. Based on these two evaluations, it is shown that there is no technique which has a superior accuracy over the others. However, Slope One algorithm is eminent in terms of fit time and mean response time. © 2019 Insight Society.","Co-clustering; Collaborative filtering; Matrix factorization; Slope one; Vixio-interactive fiction platform",,,,,,,"Manuaba, I.B.K., Text-Based Games as Potential Media for Improving Reading Behaviour in Indonesia (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 116, pp. 214-221; Darmawan, A., Valdo, S., Ignatius, I., Manuaba, I.B.K., A Comparative Study Between Narrative Fiction and Interactive Fiction to Enhance Youth Literacy in Indonesia (2018) 11th Annual International Conference on Computer Games Multimedia and Allied Technologies (CGAT 2018), pp. 15-21; Textadventures, Textadventures. co. uk-Create and play text adventure games (2018) Textadventures; textadventures.co.uk, Quest-Write text adventure games and interactive stories; Inform, About Interactive Fiction: Inform (2018) Inform; Melville, P., Sindhwani, V., Recommender Systems (2011) Encycl.

In another area, there is also phenomenon of business concept known as ""Social Business"". Social Business has been introduced by Muhammad Yunus, an awardee of Nobel Peace Prize for founding the Gramen Bank and Microcredit concept. Today, the concept of Social Business has also been enthused by people around the world. A lot of communities, including educational institutions, have been introduced this concept in their learning materials. Applying a Combine Game concept, especially to learn and understand further about the basic concept of Social Business, could become a potential solution for an interactive learning media. This paper describes the development of a Combined Game application as a media to introduce Social Business to people in more interactive and fun way.

Reading behaviour has become important since it helps people to develop their mind; expand creativity and imagination; and discover new things. However, the average reading behaviour of Indonesians, especially for the young generation, is still low. It is evidenced by most of the youth nowadays prefer using their smartphones rather than reading books. With the available technology of smartphones and tablets, it could become one of the many potential ways in addressing the lack of their reading behaviours f. The utilization of a text-based game could encourage and motivate people to be involved in more reading activities. This paper describes a study to develop and enhance a text-based game that has a potential feature to motivate the reading behaviour of youths. The outcome of this study is to evaluate the possibility of text-based games as an alternative method in encouraging the young generation to improve their reading habits and behaviours. © 2017 The Authors.

Distributions provide a means of summarizing data and a model that produces a particular distribution is known, so that if the data is found to match a known distribution a useful model is available for interpreting the data. This paper presents the analysis using the Weibull distribution to evaluate the user performance of the prototype telerobotics user interface. This prototype was deployed for public testing at an exhibition in the CSIRO Discovery Centre, Canberra, Australia, over three months. An investigation of operator requests to three models of telerobotics control from a total of 6139 total user sessions was found to fit Weibull distributions. All of the devices offered operators the opportunity to manipulate wooden blocks through the application with three model controls. Usage patterns were quite different on the different control models, but operator behavior could be characterized by the two parameters of the Weibull distribution. One of the parameters, the shape parameter, was found to be nearly invariant so the comparison could be reduced to the scale parameter. This meant interfaces can be compared with a single value calculated from automatically captured data during use of the interface. © 2017 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved","Interface; Telerobotics; User performance; Weibull distribution",,,,,"Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO","This experiment and data collection was part of my PhD degree.

The actual operation and control of a remote machine must be supported by an interface which provides enough information through visualization from a remote location to complete a task. This can be achieved with a Mixed Reality (MR) environment. The concept is to combine information from the real world and a virtual world. An experiment was conducted to assess the differences between two platforms and to determine interface features required to maximize operator performance and satisfaction. The result indicates that both mixed reality environments tested were suitable for teleoperation where sufficient information to perform the task could be modeled in the virtual world. However, one of the environments turned out to be superior where the task required information in the video but not modeled in the virtual environment. The preferred environment provided overlays on the video that were updated live as the model was manipulated where the other environment updated video overlays on completion of the manipulation. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Actual operation; Mixed reality; Mixed-reality environment; Operator performance; Remote location; Remote machines; Situational awareness; Teleoperation interface; Virtual worlds; Interactive computer graphics; Remote control; Robotics; Visualization; Virtual reality",,,,,,"Monferrer, A., Bonyuet, D., Cooperative robot teleoperation through virtual reality interface (2002) The Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation (IV'02); Milgram, P., Takemura, H., Utsumi, A., Augmented reality: A class of display on the reality-virtuality continuum (1994) Telemanipulator and Telepresence Technologies, 2351. , SPIE; Bajura, M., Fuchs, H., Ohbuchi, R., Merging virtual objects with the real world: Seeing ultrasound imagery within the patient (1992) SIGGRAPH '92, , Chicago; Rashid, O., Bamford, W., Coulton, P., PAC-LAN: Mixed-reality gaming with RFID-enable mobile phone (2006) ACM Computers in Entertainment, 4 (4); Thomas, G., (2009) Mixed Reality Techniques for TV and their Application for On-Set and Pre-Visualization in Film Production, p. 6; Duff, E., Caris, C., Bonchis, A., The development of a telerobotic rock breaker (2009) 7th International Conference on Field and Service Robots (FSR 2009), , Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA; Fong, T., Cabrol, N., Thorpe, C., A personal user interface for collaborative human-robot exploration (2001) International Symposioum on Artificial Intelegence, Robotics, and Automtion in Space, , Montreal, Canada; Domingues, C., Outmane, S., Davesne, F., (2008) A Distributed Software Architecture for Collaborative Teleoperation Based on a VR Platform and Web Application Interoperability; Sheridan, T.B., (1992) Telerobotics, Automation, and Human Supervisory Control, , London, England: The MIT Press Cambridge, Massachusetts; Verna, D., (1999) Virtual Reality and Tele-operation: A Common Framework; Manuaba, I.B.K., Taylor, K., Gedeon, T., Exploration of second life as a virtual game environment for teleoperation (2010) APCHI Bali; Nebout, F., Taylor, K., Mendis, S., Gesture based interface for robot control (2010) APCHI2010, pp. 680-685. , Sanur, Indonesia","Manuaba, I.B.K.; Commonwealth Science Industrial and Research Organization, , Canberra, Australia; email: bagus.manuaba@csiro.au",,,,"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, ICRA 2011","9 May 2011 through 13 May 2011","Shanghai",94261,10504729,9781612843865,PIIAE,,"English","Proc IEEE Int Conf Rob Autom",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871673168

This requires visual information and communication references to be deployed in conjunction with an enhanced human machine interface. Recently, the use of video display or virtual reality environment plays an important role in delivering information to the operator. To provide sufficient information about the remote environment in teleoperation interfaces, we explored the characteristics of game engines as well as their similarities with the teleoperation interface. We examined a virtual game environment called Second Life (SL), and this paper aims to discover how a virtual game might be applied in teleoperation interfaces to obtain accurate information from a remote location. More specifically, we will demonstrate what is required and not currently available from a game environment that can act as a teleoperation interface.","Game; Interfaces; Second life; Teleoperation; Virtual reality environments","Game; Hazardous environment; Human Machine Interface; Remote environment; Second Life; Teleoperation interface; Virtual-reality environment; Visual information; Interfaces (materials); Virtual reality; Remote control",,,,,,"Bartle, R.A., (2004) Designing Virtual Worlds, pp. xxi. , ([electronic resource] edn) Indianapolis, Ind.: New Riders Pub. 741 p.: ill.; 23 cm; Castronova, E., (2005) Synthetic Worlds: The Business and Culture of Online Games, pp. xi. , Chicago: University of Chicago Press 332 p.; 24 cm; Duff, E., Caris, C., Bonchis, A., Taylor, K., Gunn, C., Adcock, M., The development of a telerobotic rock breaker (2009) 7th International Conference on Field and Service Robots (FSR 2009), , Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA; Gazzard, A., Playing in a virtual world: Exploration and aspect of play (2007) 17th International Conference on Artificial Reality and Telexistence 2007, , IEEE Computer Society; Monferrer, A., Bonyuet, D., Cooperative robot teleoperation through virtual reality interface (2002) The Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation (IV'02); Reichenbach, T., Miclic, D., Kovacic, Z., (2006) Supervisory Control by Using Active 3D Models In-the-loop; Robbins, S., Bell, M., (2008) Second Life for Dummies, , Canada: Willey Publishing, Inc., Indianapolis, Indiana; Sheridan, T.B., (1992) Telerobotics, Automation, and Human Supervisory Control, p. 393. , London, England: The MIT Press Cambridge, Massachusetts; Sherman, W.R., Craig, A.B., (2003) Understanding Virtual Reality: Interface, Application, and Design, pp. xxiv. , Amsterdam; Boston: Morgan Kaufmann Publishers 582 p; (2007) A Beginner's Guide to Second Life, , v3image version 1.1: Archebooks Publishing Incorporated; Verna, D., (1999) Virtual Reality and Tele-operation: A Common Framework; Weber, A., Rufer-Bach, K., Platel, R., (2008) Creating Your World: The Official Guide to Advanced Content Creation for Second Life, , Canada: Wiley Publishing, Inc., Indianapollis, Indiana; White, B.A., (2008) Second Life: A Guide to Your Virtual World, , United State of America: Quo Publishing; Yang, X., Chen, Q., Virtual reality tools for internet-based robotic teleoperation (2004) Eight IEEE International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real-Time Applications (DS-RT'04)","CSIRO ICT Centre, Action, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",,"Udayana University, Centre for Ergonomics Study (CeFES);Perhimpunan Ergonomi Indonesia (PEI) / IES;International Ergonomics Association (IEA);Bali Human Ecology Study Group (Bali-HESG);Bali Government",,"Joint International Conference on Asia Pasific Computer Human Interaction and Ergofuture 2010, APCHI-ERGOFUTURE 2010","2 August 2010 through 6 August 2010","Bali",102330,,9786028566858,,,"English","Proc. - APCHI-ERGOFUTURE",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893223940

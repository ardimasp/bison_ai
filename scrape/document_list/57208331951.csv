A city identity as measured by its brand equity can only cover part of city’s complexities. Previous studies have suggested using corporate angle to describe the identity of a city. This research used the corporate identity model (AC 2 ID Test) to reveal a city’s identity. The sample is Bandung, capital city of West Java and the third largest city in Indonesia. Based on a qualitative approach, the corporate identity model (AC 2 ID Test) was used to discover the multi-dimensional identity of the city today. The research revealed that the current development plan of Bandung is inconsistent with several elements that make up the actual identity of Bandung today. This gap has the potential to cause an identity shift and may impact upon the city’s overall competitiveness. These findings suggest adjustments to the city planning to be consistent with the identity of the city that is embedded in the minds of the community to strengthen the characteristics and uniqueness of Bandung. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","AC 2 ID Test; Bandung smart city; City Branding; City identity; Corporate identity",,,,,,"Anholt, S., The anholt-GMI city brands index: How the world sees the world’s cities (2006) Place Branding, 2 (1), pp. 18-31; Anholt, S., (2007) Competitive Identity.

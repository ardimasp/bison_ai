Joglo-roofed buildings are still very popular in Indonesia, especially for the people of Central Java. Joglo roof is a roof that has two different slope angles, and has a partner on the other side of the mirror. The angle in the meeting of two roofs on the same side must be greater than 180O. Unsteadystate heat equations can represent temperature distribution in joglo-roofed buildings. Using a finite difference scheme with the ghost point method that is solved numerically and uses the Quadratic Extrapolation approach, unsteady-state heat equations can be solved. The results of this simulation aim to be a reference that can be used by construction industry workers in the construction of buildings that have a joglo roof. This research results in the fact that the longer the time given, the high temperature value will decrease by itself due to heat distribution. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The shape of a roof is a very influential factor shaping a sense of comfort in the house. Henceforth, everyone will have to sort different forms in choosing the proper roof model that makes them feel comfortable. This research developed a mathematical modeling of the temperature distribution of a room that is influenced by the shape of the roof. This research uses different types of roof to be studied, namely, a rectangular house with a straight, triangular, convex and concave roof. Room temperature distribution is analogous to the concept of thermal fluid dynamics equations. Solution heat equation was solved numerically through explicit finite difference method. However, due to the random observation domain, this study uses ghost-point method. This method uses the quadratic extrapolation approach. The development of mathematical models in the program was compiled using python language, so that the program can represent the temperature of the room at any point well. This research shows that a house which with straight roof is the most efficient in terms of heat distribution.

Analysis of temperature distribution for certain traditional houses with different roof shapes in Indonesia are presented in this paper. It seems interesting to analyzed since the roof of traditional houses apparently adapted in home architecture nowadays. Temperature distribution represented by steady state heat equation and solved by numerical method using finite difference method. Quadratic extrapolation toward ghost point method is also used here to accommodate the arbitrary domain problem.

In this paper, we study the relevance of sinusoidal beds as shoreline protection through the Bragg scattering mechanism. As well known, a relatively small amplitude of sinusoidal beds can reduce the amplitude of incident waves effectivelly, due to Bragg resonance. Bragg resonance will occur if the wavelength of the monochromatic wave is twice the wavelength of sinusoidal beds. We apply the multiple scale asymptotic expansion method to the linear Shallow initial value problem for sinusoidal beds. the effect of Bragg resonance pass through sinusoidal beds has been studied for surface displacement of water waves. We found that a larger amplitude disturbance leads to larger reflected wave amplitude. This result explains that the long shore sandbar indeed can reduce the amplitude of incident wave. Actually, wave's propagation not only derives from surface displacement, but also from potential velocity. At the end, we show that the sinusoidal beds can reduce the potential velocity of incident wave. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Bragg Resonance; potential velocity; sinusoidal beds","Artificial intelligence; Crack propagation; Initial value problems; Resonance; Surface measurement; Velocity; Wave transmission; Amplitude disturbances; Asymptotic expansion method; Bottom undulation; Bragg resonance; Monochromatic wave; Shoreline protection; sinusoidal beds; Surface displacement; Water waves",,,,,"Pudjaprasetya, S.R., Chendra, H.D., An Optimal Dimension of Submerged Parallel Bars as a Wave Reflector Bull.

We also modify the robots controller CM-510 in order able to communicate efficiently using main controller. The proposed method is able to determine and estimate the position of a ball and kick the ball correctly with the success percentage greater than 90%. We evaluate and present the performance of the system. © 2014 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",,"Color; Communication systems; Robot applications; Distance estimation; High definition; Humanoid soccer robots; Important features; Object Detection; Object measurement; Pan-tilt camera; PID controllers; Information technology",,,,,"Ha, I., Tamura, Y., Asama, H., Han, J., Hong, D.W., Development of open humanoid platform darwin-op (2011) 2011 Proceedings of SICE Annual Conference (SICE, pp. 2178-2181. , IEEE; Martin, F., Aguero, C., Canas, J.M., Perdices, E., (2010) Humanoid soccer player design; Blanes, F., Embedded distributed vision system for humanoid soccer robot (2011) Journal of Physical Agents, 5 (1), pp. 55-62; Behnke, S., Rojas, R., A hierarchy of reactive behaviors handles complexity (2001) ECAI-WS 2000.

Here we take into account the presence of current and assume that the shore on the right of the sinusoidal beds can absorb wave completely. As well known, a relatively small amplitude of sinusoidal beds can reduce the amplitude of incident waves effectivelly, due to Bragg resonance. Bragg resonance will occur if the wavelength of the monochromatic wave is twice the wavelength of sinusoidal beds. We apply the multiple scale asymptotic expansion method to the linear Shallow Water Equation for sinusoidal beds. When there is current, two wave numbers lead to Bragg resonances. Otherwise, there will be only one wave number. A transmission and reflection coefficient are given and used to predict the amplitude reduction. The effect of sinusoidal beds to transmission and reflection waves are simulated analitycally. It shows that the sinusoidal beds can reduce the amplitude of incident wave. © IOP Publishing Ltd 2013.",,"Equations of motion; Reflection; Resonance; Asymptotic expansion method; Bragg scattering; Linear shallow water equations; Monochromatic wave; Reflection waves; Shoreline protection; Small amplitude; Transmission and reflection coefficient; Wave transmission",,,,,"Heathershaw, A.D., Seabed-wave resonance and sandbar growth (1982) Nature, 296 (5855), pp. 343-345. , 10.1038/296343a0 0028-0836; Mei, C.C., Multiple Scattering by an Extended Region of in homogeneities (2004) Lecture Notes; Yu, J., Mei, C.C., Do Longshore Bars Shelter the Shore?

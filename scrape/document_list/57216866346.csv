This research paper is intended to find out the influence of the characteristics of flash sale, namely perceived perishability and perceived scarcity on attitude towards flash sale and its effect on online shopping enjoyment and impulse buying. The study was conducted on flash sale users in C2C online commerce marketplaces in Indonesia. Data was taken from 376 respondents through a google form link that was spread using whatsapp. Data analysis is done through structural equation modelling using the SmartPLS 3 program. Some useful insights have been found by the results. There are significant positive relationships between perceived perishability and perceived scarcity on attitude towards flash sale and also significant positive relationships between attitude towards flash sale on online shopping enjoyment and impulse buying. This research has implications for e-commerce management to maintain the characteristics of flash sale. The recommendation for further research is to add other factors that are characteristic of flash sales and see whether differences in duration and availability of goods can affect consumer purchase intentions. © 2020, IJSTR.","Attitudes toward flash sale; C2C E-commerce; Flash sale; Impulse buying; Perceived perishability; Perceived scarcity; Shopping enjoyment",,,,,,"Agrawal, S., Sareen, S.A., Flash Sales – The Game Changer in Indian E-Commerce Industry (2016) International Journal of Advance Research and Innovation, 4 (1), pp. 192-195; Di Fattaa, D., Patton, D., Viglia, G., The determinants of conversion rates in SME e-commerce websites (2018) Economic Research.

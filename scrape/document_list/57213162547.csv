It can minimize the effort in software development to adjust and adapt the changes in business processes. In this study, we used SOA and Micro Services Concept to integrate applications for front end and back end mechanism. X is a company engaged in online healthcare and Y is a subsidiary of company X which also acts as a vendor and contributes to the supply of products. In this study, we propose the integration of these two separate applications using the service-oriented architecture concept. SOA concept can support the integration in various platform application in information systems between many organizations. We also used micro services concept to identify and analyze the list of micro services needed. In the result, we proposed reusable services, Restful web services architecture, API endpoint in micro services, and list of micro services. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The transformation of the system from Model View Controller (MVC) with a large codebase evolved into SOA through the microservices approach, this is an important part in order to promote independence, speed and security. according to the conditions of the company through steps that are comprehensive and effective. adaptation of microservices architecture is very important in terms of development life cycle culture in a company and these changes must be done with a sustainable approach in order to achieve the target when applying microservices includes flexibility, speed, and security. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Impact, many companies have become interested in online social marketing programs to invite consumers. However, even though the companies said they would need to be active on social media, they did not really understand how to do it, how to determine performance indicators, and how to measure them. As companies develop social media strategies, platforms like Instagram, Youtube, and Twitter connect elements that stand alone, not part of an integrated system. This article provides a systematic way to discuss and conceptualize online social media, as an ecosystem of related elements that use digital and traditional media. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

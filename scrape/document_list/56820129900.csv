A lot of studies have been done to understand the effects of knowledge creation on performance. Although there are a lot of empirical research related with knowledge creation, but the review on the research direction of knowledge creation is still limited. This paper gives insight on knowledge creation and performance, analyzes the empirical research, and provide future direction. The method used for this research is literature review by collecting and analyzing empirical Scopus articles from 2014 until 2020 by using two keywords: 'knowledge creation' AND performance also SECI AND performance. Result shows that research in knowledge creation has been done in various countries and industries, with the term knowledge creation process and SECI indicators widely used to represent knowledge creation. More research is still needed to show how knowledge creation affects performance. © 2020 IEEE.","Knowledge creation; Knowledge creation process; Literature review; Performance","Competitive strategy; Empirical research; Empirical studies; Knowledge creations; Literature reviews; Information management",,,,,,"Sin, A.B., Zailani, S., Iranmanesh, M., Ramayah, T., Structural equation modelling on knowledge creation in six sigma dmaic project and its impact on organizational performance (2015) Intern.

This study observed non-finance Kompas100 listed firms from 2011 to 2015. Using a set of sampling criteria, a final sample size of 56 firms was determined. The voluntary disclosure level was measured by a modified Botosan index. A content analysis of sample annual reports was undertaken to determine the voluntary disclosure index of the firms under study. The firm valuation was proxied by the firms' share prices. Pooled OLS regression analyses were employed to analyse the data. The result showed that the firms' aggregate voluntary disclosure index (VDI) was valued positively in the market. Consistent results had been generated even after controlling for the firms' size and leverage. Further analysis of individual voluntary disclosure showed that three of seven voluntary disclosure categories were found to be the main value-driven categories, namely, key non-finance statistics, R&D activities and value-added disclosures. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Firm valuation; IDX; Kompas100; Voluntary disclosure; Voluntary disclosure score index",,,,,,"The authors wish to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika journal team that help publish this article.","Botosan, C.

The financial reporting process produces earnings viewed as increasingly ‘incomplete’ for valuation purposes by the capital market despite moves towards high-quality financial reporting standards (IFRS) during the sample period 1995–2015. Time-series analyses reveal that EQ decreases rather than increases through time. The role of earnings in valuation is replaced by other attributes, most notably net dividends. Firms that pay out dividends are valued significantly higher, and firms that issue equity are valued lower. These results are robust regardless of other accounting, market and governance controls. Large and closely held firms are valued higher than smaller firms, consistent with some aspects of the political cost hypothesis. Shares with higher idiosyncratic risk are valued higher, consistent with option value, as are shares where the volume of shares traded is more volatile. Collectively, the results indicate that the mere adoption of high-quality accounting standards (IFRS) and other nominal changes in capital market regulations do not automatically increase the quality of the financial reporting process. © 2018 CPA Australia",,,,,,,,"Akbar, S., Stark, A., Deflators, Net Shareholder Cash Flows, Dividends, Capital Contributions and Estimated Models of Corporate Valuation (2003) Journal of Business Finance & Accounting, 30 (9-10), pp. 1211-1233; Ball, R., Shivakumar, L., Earnings Quality in UK Private Firms: Comparative Loss Recognition Timeliness (2005) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 39 (1), pp. 83-128. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacceco.2004.04.001; Ball, R., Shivakumar, L., The Role of Accruals in Asymmetrically Timely Gain and Loss Recognition (2006) Journal of Accounting Research, 44 (2), pp. 207-242. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2006.00198.x; Ball, R., Robin, A., Wu, J.S., Incentives Versus Standards: Properties of Accounting Income in Four East Asian Countries (2003) Journal of Accounting & Economics, 361-3, pp. 235-270; Barth, M.E., Cram, D., Nelson, K., Accruals and Prediction of Future Cash Flows (2001) The Accounting Review, 76 (1), pp. 27-58. , https://doi.org/10.2308/accr.2001.76.1.27; Barth, M.E., Landsman, W.R., Raval, V., Wang, S., (2017) Asymmetric Timeliness and the Resolution of Investor Disagreement and Uncertainty at Earnings Announcements, , https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2348905, ’ Rock Center for Corporate Governance at Stanford University Working Paper 162; UNC Kenan-Flagler Research Paper; Basu, S., The Conservatism Principle and the Asymmetric Timeliness of Earnings (1997) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 24 (1), pp. 3-37. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S0165-4101(97)00014-1; Black, F., Scholes, M., The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities (1973) Journal of Political Economy, 813, pp. 637-654; Brown Jr, W.D., He, H., Teitel, K., Conditional Conservatism and the Value Relevance of Accounting Earnings: An International Study (2006) European Accounting Review, 15 (4), pp. 605-626. , https://doi.org/10.1080/09638180601102198; Burgstahler, D.C., Hail, L., Leuz, C., The Importance of Reporting Incentives: Earnings Management in European Private and Public Firms (2006) The Accounting Review, 81 (5), pp. 983-1016. , https://doi.org/10.2308/accr.2006.81.5.983; Cahan, S.B., The Effect of Antitrust Investigations on Discretionary Accruals: A Refined Test of the Political–Cost Hypothesis (1992) The Accounting Review, 67 (1), pp. 77-95; Chua, W.F., Taylor, S., The Rise and Rise of IFRS: An Examination of IFRS Diffusion (2008) Journal of Accounting & Public Policy, 276, pp. 462-473; Davis-Friday, P., Eng, L.L., Liu, C.-S., The Effects of the Asian Crisis, Corporate Governance and Accounting System on the Valuation of Book Value and Earnings (2006) The International Journal of Accounting, 41, pp. 22-40; Dechow, P.M., Accounting Earnings and Cash Flows as Measures of Firm Performance: The Role of Accounting Accruals (1994) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 18 (1), pp. 3-42. , https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-4101(94)90016-7; Dechow, P.M., Dichev, I.D., The Quality of Accruals and Earnings: The Role of Accrual Estimation Errors (2002) The Accounting Review, 77 (s-1), pp. 35-59. , https://doi.org/10.2308/accr.2002.77.s-1.35; Dechow, P.M., Ge, W., Schrand, C., Understanding Earnings Quality: A Review of the Proxies, Their Determinants and Their Consequences (2010) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 50 (2-3), pp. 344-401. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacceco.2010.09.001; Dichev, I.D., Graham, J.R., Harvey, C.R., Rajgopal, S., Earnings Quality: Evidence from the Field (2013) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 56 (2-3), pp. 1-33; Domadenik, P., Prašnikar, J., Svejnar, J., Restructuring of Firms in Transition: Ownership, Institutions and Openness to Trade (2008) Journal of International Business Studies, 39 (4), pp. 725-746. , https://doi.org/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400379; Domadenik, P., Prašnikar, J., Svejnar, Political Connectedness, Corporate Governance, and Firm Performance (2016) Journal of International Business Studies, 139 (2), pp. 411-428. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-015-2675-4; Dou, Y., Hope, O.-K., Thomas, B.W., Relationship-specificity, Contract Enforceability, and Income Smoothing (2013) The Accounting Review, 88 (5), pp. 1629-1656. , https://doi.org/10.2308/accr-50489; Ewert, R., Wagenhofer, A., Earnings Quality Metric and What They Measure (2011) SSRN Electronic Journal, , http://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1697042; Francis, J., LaFond, R., Olsson, P.M., Schipper, K., Costs of Equity and Earnings Attributes (2004) The Accounting Review, 79 (4), pp. 967-1010. , https://doi.org/10.2308/accr.2004.79.4.967; Francis, J., Schipper, K., Have Financial Statements Lost Their Relevance?

Accrual quality is assessed using the abnormal accrual model and Dechow and Dichev (DD) model; earnings persistence and predictability are assessed through net income autoregressive model. Using 103 Indonesian non-finance IPO firms, this research concludes that earnings quality of IPO firms changed along with the alteration of their status from private to public firms. Post-IPO (after becoming public firms), the sample shows a higher quality of earnings in terms of accrual quality and earnings persistence increases after IPO. However, this research could not reject the hypothesis of decreasing post-IPO earnings predictability due to the nature of IPO firms.

Using a sample of 372 distinct Indonesian firms listed on the IDX during the period 1995 to 2012 we show that dividends are reliably positively priced by the capital market, violating thus the dividend displacement theorem. This result persists even after controlling for some typical factors that affect firm value (capital structure, risk) and the effect of factors not separately identified, but priced by the Indonesian capital market (other information). Dividends replace accounting earnings entirely in valuation. Dividends are positively correlated to future earnings over and above current accounting earnings and other accounting and market variables. Both findings show that dividends play a central role on the Indonesian capital market. Finally, we show evidence consistent with the view that earnings management of Indonesian firms after 2002 is contractually efficient rather than opportunistic. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,,,,,,"Akbar, S., Stark, A.W., Deflators, Net Shareholder Cash Flows, Dividends, Capital Contributions and Estimated Models of Corporate Valuation (2003) Journal of Business Finance & Accounting, 30, pp. 1211-1233; Baker, H.K., Powell, G.E., Dividend Policy in Indonesia: Survey Evidence from Executives (2012) Journal of Asia Business Studies, 6, pp. 79-92; Ball, R., Robin, A., Shung Wu, J., Incentives Versus Standards: Properties of Accounting Income in Four East Asian Countries (2003) Journal of Accounting & Economics, 36, pp. 235-270; Bartram, S.M., Brown, P., How, J.C.Y., Verhoeven, P., (2012) Agency Conflicts and Corporate Payout Policies: A Global Study, , http://ssrn.com/abstract&#x003D;1068281, Working paper (March 13, 2012), SSRN; Brown, P., Preiato, J., Tarca, A., Measuring Country Differences in Enforcement of Accounting Standards: An Audit and Enforcement Proxy (2014) Journal of Business Finance & Accounting, 41 (1-2), pp. 1-52; Burgstahler, D.C., Hail, L., Leuz, C., The Importance of Reporting Incentives: Earnings Management in European Private and Public Firms (2006) The Accounting Review, 81 (5), pp. 983-1016; Chua, W.F., Taylor, S., The Rise and Rise of IFRS: An Examination of IFRS Diffusion (2008) Journal of Accounting & Public Policy, 27, pp. 462-473; Davis-Friday, P., Eng, L.L., Liu, C.-S., The Effects of the Asian Crisis, Corporate Governance and Accounting System on the Valuation of Book Value and Earnings (2006) The International Journal of Accounting, 41, pp. 22-40; DeAngelo, H., DeAngelo, L., Skinner, D.J., Are Dividends Disappearing?

Many of them are now big public firms that contribute significantly to the Indonesian economy. As public firms, their reports are used by investors to value their traded shares. A firm’s reported earnings are important information for investors. This study aims to examine the earnings quality of Indonesian listed family businesses and compare this information with their counterparts. Using earnings persistence and predictability as proxies for earnings quality, this study finds that the earnings of Indonesia family businesses are less persistent than their counterpart’s earnings, due to type II agency problem and business diversification. However, there is no difference found in earnings predictability of both businesses. Thus, this study concludes that Indonesian family businesses have poor earnings quality compared to their counterparts. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

Using a sample of LQ45 listed firms in the period 2010-2011; we find that increasing voluntary disclosure reduces firms’ cost of equity capital. The result persists even after we control with other common variables influencing cost of equity. This result supports findings from prior research in emerging countries. Thus, it could be conjectured that, regardless of the efficiency of the financial reporting environment, voluntary disclosure does reduce information asymmetry, which leads to lower cost of equity. Further analysis shows that based on voluntary disclosure categorization by Botosan only a firm’s background information significantly reduces the firm’s cost of equity, while other voluntary disclosures appear to be unrelated to cost of equity. The result is explained by institutional theory. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

More stakeholders and regulations demand high-quality financial reports. Using Indonesian quoted non-finance and related industry IPO firms, this study purports to examine the change in reported earnings quality, measured by accrual quality, before and after the IPOs. Based on the discretionary-accrual model, we find that there is no difference of accrual quality before and after IPO. However, as we hypothesized, based on cash-flow model, the result shows that accrual quality increases after IPO due to diminishing of unintentional accrual estimation errors after IPO. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

In addition, this paper also examines whether there are differences among the four variables above in demographic factors. Convenience sampling was used to conduct the survey. There were 150 respondents who took the survey in Jakarta and Surabaya, Indonesia. A 4 point Likert Scale was adopted and data analysis was performed using Regression analysis, ANOVA and an Independent T- test. There was a positive relationship between Attitudinal Loyalty towards Repeat Patronage Intention. However, Perceived Service Quality and Corporate Social Responsibility were not positively related with Repeat Patronage Intention. Furthermore, there was a different outcome in age group on Perceived Service Quality and Corporate Social Responsibility and a significance difference in perception of Corporate Social Responsibility within the education level group. The banking industry should have a strategic plan which includes the role of Corporate Social Responsibility and sincerely implement the plan as Corporate Social Responsibility is one of the variable that can enhance the Perceived Service Quality, Attitudinal Loyalty and Repeat Patronage Intention. Further study could expand to other service industries such as the hotel and tourism and conduct in other cities in Indonesia besides Jakarta and Surabaya.","Attitudinal loyalty; Corporate social responsibility; Jakarta and surabaya; Perceived service quality; Repeat patronage",,,,,,"(2013) 'Keeping up with Indonesia's fickle consumers', , http://www.asianewsnet.net/news-35559.html, Asian News Network, March 10, 2013; (2013) 'Laporan Pengawasan Perbankan (LPP) 2011', , http://www.bi.go.id/NR/rdonlyres/1AD2B012-5F0F-4F51-8FD2-CB1D763C80CA/26126/LPP2011_Final.pdf, Bank Indonesia, March 13, 2013; (2012) 'Undang-Undang Republik Indonesia nomor 40 tahun 2007 tentang perseroan terbatas', , http://aria.bapepam.go.id/reksadana/files/regulasi/UU%2040%202007%20Perseroan%20Terbatas.pdf, BAPEPAMLK, March 9, 2013; Berens, G., Van Riel, C.B.M., Van Bruggen, G.H., 'Corporate association and consumer product responses: the moderating role of corporate brand dominance' (2005) Journal of Marketing, 69, pp. 35-48. , July; Caroll, A.B., 'The pyramid of corporate social responsibility: toward the moral management of organizational stakeholders' (1991) Business Horizons, pp. 39-48. , July August; Chaudhuri, A., Holbrook, M.B., 'The chain of effect from brand trust and brand affect to brand performance: the role of brand loyalty' (2001) Journal of Marketing, 65, pp. 81-93. , April; Chiou, J.S., Droge, C., 'Service quality, trust, specific asset investment, and expertise: direct and indirect effects in a satisfaction-loyalty framework' (2006) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 34 (4), pp. 613-627; Dick, A., Basu, K., 'Customer loyalty: toward an integrated conceptual, framework' (1994) Journal of Academy of Marketing Science, 22 (2), pp. 99-113; Freeman, R.E., Evan, W.M., 'Corporate Governance: A stakeholder interpretation' (1990) Journal of Behavioral Economics, 19, pp. 337-359; (2013) '10 bank peraih best bank service excellence 2012', , http://www.infobanknews.com/2012/05/ini-dia-10-bank-peraih-best-bank-service-excellence-2012/, InfoBankNews, March 29; (2013) '10 bank yang memiliki nasabah paling loyal tahun 2011', , http://www.infobanknews.com/2011/01/10-bank-yang-memiliki-nasabah-tabungan-paling-loyal/, InfoBankNews, March 23; Jain, A.K., Pinson, C., Malhotra, N.K., 'Customer loyalty as a construct in the marketing of banking services' (1987) International Journal of Bank Marketing, 5 (3), pp. 49-72; Lewis, B.R., Soureli, M., 'The antecedents of consumer loyalty in retail banking' (2006) Journal of consumer Behavior, 5, pp. 15-31; Lovelock, C.H., Wirtz, J., Chew, P., (2009) 'Essentials of Services Marketing', , Prentice Hall, Pearson Education South Asia Pte.

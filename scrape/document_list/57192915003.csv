The data for the research were taken from ten samples program in BankVision legacy system. The proposed solution consists of several steps with the goals to transform the source code into DOT language and render it using Graphviz. For each sample, a test script is generated and compared with existing scripts. The cyclomatic complexity is also calculated to see how complex the samples are. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

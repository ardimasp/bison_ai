Until now, many people are still not fully aware of the risks of COVID-19. On YouTube, the most widely used social media platform in Indonesia, information about COVID-19 is available. However, much misleading information has caused public worry and low public trust in the government in overcoming this pandemic. Popular YouTubers who have many subscribers can reach many viewers. Some of them made videos about COVID-19. This study aims to analyze how individual Indonesian YouTubers present the issue of COVID-19 in creating public awareness in Indonesia through their YouTube video content based on ethos, pathos, and logos. The research used qualitative content analysis methods includes planning, data collection, data analysis, and finally, creating a report and presentation of the result. This study analyzes YouTube video content created by five individual Indonesian YouTubers who have the most subscribers ranking. The unit analysis is video content about COVID-19 of the YouTubers through a visual image, audio, and text. The study results show that YouTubers use credible speakers on the ethos aspect (such as a pulmonologist, government spokesperson for COVID-19, doctors, and public figures) to convey information to their audience. The pathos aspect appears in serious nonverbal messages to influence the emotions of the audience. The logos aspect is verbal messages (arguments and pieces of evidence) that contains information about the characteristics of COVID-19, health protocols during a pandemic, critics to government decision making, and socio-economic impacts of coronavirus pandemic. © 2020 IEEE.","Content creator; COVID-19; Public awareness; YouTube; YouTubers","Behavioral research; Decision making; Information management; Content analysis; Content analysis method; Government decisions; Misleading informations; Public awareness; Social media platforms; Socio-economic impacts; Verbal messages; Video recording",,,,,"Khosravi, M., Perceived risk of COVID-19 pandemic: The role of public worry and trust (2020) Electronic Journal of General Medicine, 17 (4), p. em203; Beaunoyer, E., Dupéré, S., Guitton, M.J., COVID-19 and digital inequalities: Reciprocal impacts and mitigation strategies (2020) Computers in Human Behavior, 111, p. 106424; Djalante, R., Lassa, J., Setiamarga, D., Sudjatma, A., Indrawan, M., Haryanto, B., Mahfud, C., Warsilah, H., Review and analysis of current responses to COVID-19 in Indonesia: Period of January to March 2020 (2020) Progress in Disaster Science, 6, p. 100091; (2020) Worldometer, , https://www.worldometers.info/worldpopulation/indonesia-population/, Indonesia Population (LIVE), 1 July.

This research uses descriptive qualitative methods in which semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data in Indonesia (Jakarta) and United Kingdom (Norwich). The result shows that students’ intercultural communication competence improve due to direct communication and face-to-face interaction instead of social media whereby the latter is only helpful in improving students’ knowledge and understanding the differences of their home culture and the host culture. Interactivity and other abilities of social media become influential aspect to improve students’ knowledge of host culture. Moreover, social media develops relationships between the students and their hosts country. Facebook and Instagram are found to help students improve their adaptability and flexibility to different cultures. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Culture European and Indonesian students; Intercultural communication; Social media",,,,,,"Barrett, M., Intercultural competence (2012) The 2 nd Issue of the EWC Statement Series.

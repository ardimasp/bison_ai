Evolutionary algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithm and the Bees Algorithm have been used in the literature to solve this problem. In this paper, we apply the Genetic Algorithm, Bees Algorithm, and the combination of these two algorithms, which is Hybrid GA-Bees, to solve school scheduling problem. The algorithms to solve the school scheduling problems were implemented using the object-oriented paradigm and tested to create actual class schedules at a middle school in Jakarta. Our study concludes that the Hybrid GA-Bees can produce better solutions compared to the solutions generated by the Genetic Algorithm and Bees algorithm. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

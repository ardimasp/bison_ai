Ensuring the functionality of probiotics can be a challenge for manufacturers due to harsh environment conditions during processing, handling and storage. Enterococcus faecium IS-27526 is one of novel probiotic strain isolated from dadih, traditional fermented buffalo milk of West Sumatra. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of microencapsulation, moisture absorber, and storage temperature on the half-life of probiotic powder estimated by Accelerated Shelf Life Testing (ASLT). There were two treatment groups, namely free cell (FC), and microencapsulated cell (EC), with additional treatment in each group, with addition of moisture absorber (MA) and without moisture absorber, stored at various temperatures (5°C, 27°C and 37°C) for 21 days and viable counts was assessed every 7 days. Storage temperature significantly affects the half-life of probiotic powder (p<0.05). At 5°C, EC significantly showed longer half-life than EC-MA, 140.14 ± 5.701 and 113.45 ± 3.242 days, respectively, at 27°C, EC significantly shorter half-life than EC-MA, 38.64 ± 6.831 and 42.35 ± 0.973 days, respectively. Microencapsulation and moisture absorber didn't show significant effect on half-life (p>0.05) at various temperature storage. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Enterococcus faecium IS-27526; half-life; microencapsulation; moisture absorber","Bacilli; Electron emission; Fermented milk; Microencapsulation; Moisture; Accelerated shelf life testing; Additional treatment; Beneficial effects; Enterococcus faecium; Half lives; Harsh environment; Probiotic strain; Storage temperatures; Probiotics",,,,,,"Chavarri, M., Maranon, I., Carmen, M., (2012) Encapsulation Technology to Protect Probiotic Bacteria, p. 502. , ed E Rigobelo (Sau Paulo: Intech), chapter 3; Fijan, S., Microorganisms with claimed probiotic properties: An overview of recent literature (2014) Int.

It actually could be potentially developed as a health-promoting food in the form of rosella jam. As the market for rosella jam in Indonesia is not established yet, and in the advent on the development of renewable energies in the 21st century, it is a fascinating idea to design a rosella jam factory employing solar energy as one of the renewable energies in the future that might lead the sustainable food business in Indonesia. The rosella jam factory is designed to produce 40000 bottles of rosella jam (weight: 250 g) per month, sold for Rp. 25000, rendering income of Rp. 1 billion per month. It needs a one-off capital cost of Rp. 2.56 billion for production equipments and machines (not including solar panels), with monthly manufacturing cost of 624 million (included 20 kW electricity) that will reach break-even point (BEP) at 13th month. Solar panels (mainly consists of 840 solar panels, 200 Wp working for 4 hours) worth of 2.64 billion is recommended to be installed on the 19th month to avoid negative cumulative net present value (CNPV). © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","BEP; CNPV; renewable energy; rosella; solar energy; solar panel","Chemical contamination; Manufacture; Solar cell arrays; Solar energy; CNPV; Health improvements; Manufacturing cost; Preliminary design; Production equipments; Renewable energies; rosella; Solar panels; Solar concentrators",,,,,,"Muresan, C., Gbadamosi, A., Muste, S., Scrob, S., Rat, A., Study Concerning the Quality of Jam Products Based on Banana and Ginger (2014) J. of Agroalimentary Processes and Technologies, 20, pp. 408-411; Broomfield, R.W., (1996) The Manufacture of Preserves, Flavourings and Dried Fruits, p. 165; Margono, T., (1993) Buku Panduan Teknologi Pangan, , http://www.ristek.go.id, Accesed at 11 January 2018; Fachruddin, L., (1998) Memilih Dan Memanfaatkan Bahan Tambahan Makanan; Handarini, K., Potensi Ekstrak Bunga Rosella (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.

The morphology observed by SEM that exhibited the oil globules were covered by chitosan. They were aggregated and rough droplets. Interactions among the materials were observed using FTIR which led to the presence of a new peak at 1736 cm-1. The coated strawberry by high-pressure homogenizer-emulsion showed the best result suppressing microbial (2.41±0.01) and mould-yeast (2.78±0.10) growth at the end of storage compared to control which were 3.37±0.02 and 3.69±0.14 for microbial and mould-yeast count respectively. © 2019 The Authors.","Chitosan; Edible coating; Microbial; Nanoemulsion; Nutmeg seed oil; Strawberry","chitosan; emulsifying agent; nutmeg oil; antimicrobial activity; Article; cinnamon; controlled study; food coating; food quality; food storage; food texture; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; microbial adhesion; microbial growth; mold; morphology; nanoemulsion; nonhuman; particle size; physical chemistry; plate count; scanning electron microscopy; strawberry; yeast",,"chitosan, 9012-76-4; nutmeg oil, 8008-45-5","Malvern, United Kingdom; Gea, Italy; Thermo","015/KM/ PKM/2018","We thank the Ministry of Research, Technology Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia which provide the funding of this research through the grant of Student Creativity Program - Research 2018 (015/KM/ PKM/2018).","Aitboulahsen, M., Zantar, S., Laglaoui, A., Chairi, H., Arakrak, A., Bakkali, M., Zerrouk, M.H., Gelatin-based edible coating combined with Mentha pulegium essential oil as bioactive packaging for strawberries (2018) Journal of Food Quality, 5, pp. 1-7. , https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/8408915; Aulakh, J., Regmi, A., Post-harvest food losses estimation - Development of consistent methodology (2013) In Selected Poster Prepared for Presentation at the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association’s AAEA and CAES Joint Annual Meeting, , 4 - 6 August 2013.

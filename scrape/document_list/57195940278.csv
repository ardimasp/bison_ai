Indonesia is a developing country which has a great enthusiasm for Internet technology. In history, the Indonesian government began developing the Internet in the early 1980s at the state universities in Indonesia. Internet started to become popular since the collapse of the Suharto regime in 1998. Until the end, the Internet became a tool used by many college students to perform a political movement. Since then, the Indonesian community began to recognize the internet-based activity. However, the progress of the Internet in Indonesia also has an impact on behavior change for young generation. This article shows to the government, parents and internet users in Indonesia how shall we manage the advancement of the Internet. © 2017 IEEE.","Behavior; Generation; Internet; Networking; Online; Social media","Developing countries; Students; Behavior; Generation; Networking; Online; Social media; Internet",,,,"Binus University","This work was supported in part by Bina Nusantara University under BINUS Research Grant.","(2015) Profil Pengguna Internet Indonesia 2014, , Association of Internet Service Provider Indonesia, APJII, January, (references); (2016) Penetrasi Dan Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia 2016, , Association of Internet Service Provider Indonesia, APJII, November, (references); Briggs, F., (2011) Smart Parenting for Safer Kids, pp. 103-140. , Australia: Jojo Publishing; Broto, G.D., (2014) Siaran Pers Tentang Riset Kominfo Dan UNICEF Mengenai Perilaku Anak Dan Remaja Dalam Menggunakan Internet, , in Siaran Pers No. 17/PIH/KOMINFO/2/2014; Bolton, R., Understanding generation y and their use of social media: A review and research agenda (2013) Journal of Service Management Emerald Group Publishing Limited, 24, pp. 245-267. , April, references; Burhanuddin, T., New consumer behaviour (2015) Majalah Marketing, 5, pp. 15-17; Fajrina, H.N., (2015) Orang Indonesia Pilih Internet Daripada Mandi, , in Press CNN Indonesia, April; Garcia, C., Engaged youth in the internet.

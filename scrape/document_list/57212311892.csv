CMK has several branches in various countries that use for operational and storage warehouse. This company faces the problem for analysing sales to decide the useful strategy since this company only uses Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) database. This study implements Online Analysis Processing (OLAP) database and data warehouse to provide useful information for this company by using the nine-step method designed by Kimball & Ross. The data will be performed into dashboard to make easier for CMK Company to analyze data. Furthermore, many useful information can be provided in short and efficient time. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

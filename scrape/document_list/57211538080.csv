Yet, through the skill of visual literacy, this particular type of media is not constrained to the children‘s audience only, but it can also be relevant to proficient readers such as young adults. The balance of fundamental design elements of visual and text forms a connection in conveying the intended narrative and meaning from the writer and/or illustrator‘s imagination. With young adults‘ awareness, visual literacy exceeds in aiding the ability to understand, interpret, and decode information, but also to form a relationship between the writer and/or illustrator with the reader. By being able to contextualise the illustrated narratives, young adult readers find an emotional relation to the story based on their life experiences. In understanding the importance of visual literacy through picture books, this research looks into the value of the medium for young adults by conducting interview analyses while observingthe importance of visual literacy within picture books. © IJSTR 2019.","Picture books; Relationship; Visual literacy; Young adults",,,,,,"Jeffers, O., (2010) ""The Heart and the Bottle,"" Harper Collins Children‘s Books, , Great Britain, Book style with; Klassen, J., I Want My Hat Back, , San Fransisco: Walker; Rosen, M., Blake, Q., (2004) Sad Book, , Books: London, Walker Books: London; Seuss, D., (2012) Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!

The city of Lasem, which located on the north coast of Java, plays a vital role as a particular batik producer in Indonesia, which is influenced by Chinese culture. The purpose of this paper is to observe and analyze the entry process of Chinese motifs in Lasem, and the influence of the culture of the center Javanese Keraton on Lasem batik. The research method used is the study of literature, while the primary theory is cultural acculturation. Through this paper, researchers try to find out the process of combining two cultural motifs, in a time phrase in the period 14 to the 19th century. © International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

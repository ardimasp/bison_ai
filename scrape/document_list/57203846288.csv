Research has shown that players generally express their emotions when playing the game. This allow us to capture the player's expression from their face and use it to dynamically adjust the game difficulties. A preliminary study was conducted to capture what kind of game that would be suitable to test dynamic balancing. The game with a dynamic balancing system then was developed using Scrum methodology as the software development methodology. Furthermore, the dynamic balancing in the game was simulated in the computer and evaluated, with some of items from Immersive Experience Questionnaire, with players played two versions of game, one with dynamic balancing activated and the other with-out dynamic balancing activated. The results evidently show that there was some statistically significant enhancement in the game with Facial Expression Recognition activated as a game dynamic game balancing compare to the one with-out Facial Expression Recognition. © 2018 The Author(s).","Dynamic Balancing; Facial Expression Recognition; Immersive Experience Questionnaire; Player Experience","Artificial intelligence; Balancing machines; Face recognition; Software design; Surveys; Dynamic balancing; Dynamic game; Facial expression recognition; Immersive; Player experience; Scrum methodologies; Software development methodologies; Computer games",,,,,"Lazzaro, N., (2004) Why We Play Games: Four Keys to More Emotion Without Story; Suryani, D., Ekaputra, V., Chowanda, A., Multi-modal asian conversation mobile video dataset for recognition task (2018) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE), 8 (5); Andrade, G., Ramalho, G., Gomes, A.S., Corruble, V., Dynamic game balancing: An evaluation of user satisfaction (2006) AIIDE, 6, pp. 3-8; Sutoyo, R., Winata, D., Oliviani, K., Supriyadi, D.M., Dynamic difficulty adjustment in tower defence (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 435-444; Jennett, C., Cox, A.L., Cairns, P., Dhoparee, S., Epps, A., Tijs, T., Measuring and defining the experience of immersion in games (2008) International Journal of Human-computer Studies, 66 (9), pp. 641-661; Brockmyer, J.H., Fox, C.M., Curtiss, K.A., McBroom, E., Burkhart, K.M., Pidruzny, J.N., The development of the game engagement questionnaire: A measure of engagement in video game-playing (2009) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 45 (4), pp. 624-634; Chowanda, A., Flintham, M., Blanchfield, P., Valstar, M., Playing with social and emotional game companions (2016) International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents, pp. 85-95; Suttichaya, V., Desktop tower defense is np-hard (2016) Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 19-25. , Springer; Prasetio, Y.L., Wijaya, R., Sjah, M.P., Christian, M.R., Chowanda, A., Location-based game to enhance players experience in survival horror game (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 116, pp. 206-213; Want, R., Hopper, A., Falcao, V., Gibbons, J., The active badge location system (1992) ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), 10 (1), pp. 91-102; Chowanda, A., Blanchfield, P., Flintham, M., Valstar, M., Erisa: Building emotionally realistic social game-agents companions (2014) International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents, pp. 134-143; Chowanda, A., Blanchfield, P., Flintham, M., Valstar, M., Play smile game with erisa (2015) IVA 2015, Fifteenth International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents; Chowanda, A., Blanchfield, P., Flintham, M., Valstar, M., Computational models of emotion, personality, and social relationships for interactions in games (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Autonomous Agents & Multiagent Systems.

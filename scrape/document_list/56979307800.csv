The grand purpose of our research is to develop drones with implementation in smart farming in Indonesia. In the sending process, the drone must be able to detect objects and reach a goal position and go back safely using GNSS. We proposed the usage of course-over-ground information to help drone in doing autonomous navigation. In the experiment that we did, the average of positional deviation of landing position between the actual landing position and the desired landing position in the flight tests of flying from start to goal is 1.1125 meters and for the tests that use the algorithm which uses course-over-ground, the positional deviation has an average of 2.39 meters. Navigation using the course-over-ground algorithm is not more reliable than the navigation algorithm with GNSS and compass at a navigation distance of less than 1 meter. © ICIC International 2020.","Autonomous spraying drone; Drone; GNSS; Navigation systems; ROS; Sprayer pesticide",,,,,"Binus University","Acknowledgment.

The existence of this medical record can provide health profile information and medical history of the patients being treated. With this basis, doctors and medical staff can provide diagnoses, suggestions for actions to be taken as well as accuracy in determining the drug for patient consumption. However, medical records in the system at the hospital have not been packaged properly invalid data conditions, because the data collection and input processes were carried out by different officers. Not only the ability of officers to interact with information system modules but also discipline, accuracy, mastery of officers in the medical field as well as the ability to read manual documents to be re-entered into the information system. This research was carried out based on direct monitoring of the system used in several hospitals and found the existence of data invalidity in the information system that has the potential to become a risk that ultimately becomes a loss both for patients and for medical staff and hospital management.

A sophisticated military robot should be needed by the military/police because it can be deployed to the battlefield or the eradication of terrorism in a remote or autonomous manner. PID controller is known as a reliable and robust control system for servo motors as an actuator of the gun. In this paper, we propose a prototype of a tank-based military robot with object detection and tracking using PID controller for simulation of shooting the enemy target based on the computer vision. The object tracker has been built for detecting upper body of the target using a library in OpenCV and the tank will track until it reaches the best position to shoot the target.

We proposed a navigation algorithm for drone including the usage of course-over-ground information to help drone in doing autonomous navigation. In the experiment that we did, the average of positional deviation of landing position between the actual landing position and the desired landing position in the flight tests of flying from start to goal is 1.1125 m and for the tests that use the algorithm which uses course-over-ground, the positional deviation has average of 2.39 m.

In the traditional project paradigm, most projects are managed using a lot of manual documents that require a relatively need much time while the field team is faced with technical work that is not possible to do manual documentation. Project management plays a role from initiation, planning, supervision and control and closure in a project life cycle. To be able to carry out all project life cycles and make decisions requires complete documentation, however, the project team is often faced with the choice of whether doing documented or doing the project. Project Management Information Systems (PMIS) are a project management tool that can assist the project team in planning, scheduling, monitoring and reporting automatically throughout the project management process. Several IS/IT project uses PMIS to help their project management, with the aim to be more effective. Then, the project will be successful in the process. This study presents the review of several previous case studies, research who used PMIS. Through this review will be able to know what benefits are obtained from the use of PMIS.

According to World Bank data, Indonesia is the country with the largest economic development in Southeast Asia. Unfortunately, the threat of terrorism in Indonesia is very large, therefore it requires a smart system such as military robots. Today's vision-based robot technology has also been used in the development of autonomous military robots. A sophisticated military robot is a robot that is needed by the military/police because it can be deployed to the battlefield or the eradication of terrorism in a remote or autonomous manner. This system is needed to reduce the remaining casualties from the army, and this combat robot system can also be operated at any time with more numbers than regular soldiers and with minimal operator needs. In this paper, we propose a prototype of a tank-based military robot with object detection and tracking and turrets for simulation of shooting the enemy target based on the computer vision. The object tracker will detect an upper body of the target using a library in OpenCV and the tank will track until it reaches the best position to shoot the target. The methods explained, and experimental results were presented. © 2019 IEEE.","computer vision; military robot; object detction; object tracker; turret","Economics; Intelligent robots; Object detection; Tanks (containers); Target tracking; Terrorism; Economic development; Military robots; Object detction; Object detection and tracking; object tracker; Robot technology; Southeast Asia; turret; Computer vision",,,,"Binus University

Knowledge at Pondok Indah Mall is still not well distributed. The company currently only focuses on knowledge of the organization, but what we need to know about individual knowledge is no less important and many have a role to play in addition to the standard operating procedure that we can receive information from companies, such as best practice, how to determine perspectives, negotiation techniques and more especially in terms of regenerating knowledge within the organization. The method used for this writing is the company's business process by approaching three components of knowledge management, people, process and technology. Then aligning the company's strategy and knowledge management strategy using the Zack framework, then designing a knowledge management system with the Tiwana framework approach. The Conclusion, KMS development is felt to be able to support employees to share knowledge well and reduce the time needed to solve cases or problems because they can use solutions stored in the data in the application and make it easier for employees to search documents. © 2018 IEEE.","Designing; KMS Application; Knowledge; Knowledge Management System (KMS)","Knowledge based systems; Pattern recognition; Personnel; Company's strategy; Culture of sharing; Designing; Innovation ideas; Knowledge; Knowledge management strategy; Knowledge management system; Standard operating procedures; Knowledge management",,,,,,"Sopandi, O.D., Politeknik, S., Bandung, N., Saud, U.S., Implementasi knowledge management pada perguruan tinggi (2016) J.

With millions of thousands of sellers every day, it is a challenge for Merchant Development (MD) teams to educate sellers, both new and reputable. The problem faced today is the lack of centralized learning information that sellers need to develop their stores. The MD team is also difficult to help improve the quality and sales of sellers in Tokopedia massively. Today, they rely more heavily on city-To-city offline activities to acquire new sellers and provide seller training in every city. Tokopedia requires a Knowledge Management System to accommodate the information needs of the seller and increase the scalability of information dissemination from the MD team. This research will analyze the problem in more detail using best practice from Asian Productivity Organization (APO) to see Tokopedia internal readiness in developing KMS and map information requirement from seller.

In terms of income, there was also a decline in growth because legacy services (voice & SMS) tended to decline due to threats from OTT. Therefore, a strategy is needed to survive this condition, one of which is to look at the digital market. The digital service business development strategy is carried out to be able to increase the company's revenue through the implementation of Machine to Machine (M2M) services given the promising potential and support of the digital ecosystem. But in reality, the implementation of digital services has not been able to have a significant impact on the company's revenue growth so that a new strategy is needed with a service innovation. This study aims to model M2M digital services into the Smart Connected Motorbike (SCM) service, as well as analyze the service delivery business model in the PT. XYZ so that it is expected to become a new source of income for cellular operators of PT. XYZ. Furthermore, this research will do investment analysis in machine to machine application.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of the implementation of ERP systems on the performance of employees in order to provide information and feedback for the management of the company. This allows for the formulation of the optimal company strategy thus improving the performance of individual employees. This study employs a qualitative analysis approach based on the Delone and McLean's model of success to analyze the data obtained from the interviews and questionnaires which is designed to resemble the Likert scale and was previously tested on the validity and reliability. This study aims to examine the causal effect of ERP information systems, specifically in utilizing the variable quality of system and information as the independent variable and the performance of employees as the dependent variable with user satisfaction and system users as the two intervening variables. The results display that the quality of sistems has both direct and indirect influence on the performance of employees. Furthermore, the quality of information has proven to show negligible effect on the performance of employees' variable. The performance of employees' variable indirectly affected by the quality variable of information through the both system users and user satisfaction intervening variables. © 2018 IEEE.","Employee Performance; Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP); Information Quality; Model of Success; System Quality","Citrus fruits; Data handling; Human resource management; Information management; Personnel rating; Reliability analysis; Resource allocation; Surveys; Employee performance; Enterprise resource planning (ERP); Enterprise resource planning systems; Information quality; Integrated database systems; Modern information technologies; Quality of information; System quality; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,,"Suroso, J.S., Strengthening of innovation network to improvethe regional competitiveness towards social transformation (case study in cimahi) (2015) Procedia Comput.

Critical assets related to information systems are very susceptible to threats that can exploit and damage assets until they lead to disruption of business processes and even lead to financial losses. PT. Autocomp Systems Indonesia (PASI) has implemented Information Security Management System (ISMS) based on ISO / IEC 27001 to define a set of risk management strategies. However, some threats still occur and make the organization to get losses. The organization needs to conduct an evaluation of risk management that has been implemented to determine whether the risk protection strategy is adequate. Evaluation is done by comparing the current condition with the expected ideal condition using Catalogue of Practices from OCTAVE. The gaps found and then the risk assessment of the related assets is carried out. The results of this study indicate that the level of risk management maturity obtained by the organization is 89.40 %. The biggest gap is found in the contingency plan/disaster recovery plan and vulnerability management. Then a mitigation plan is proposed from the results of the risk assessment using the OCTAVE Allegro approach so the risk can be controlled properly. © 2018 IEEE.","Evaluation; IS Risk Management; OCTAVE Allegro","Citrus fruits; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Losses; Management information systems; Risk assessment; Security of data; Education divisions; Evaluation; Information security management systems; Management maturities; OCTAVE Allegro; Protection strategy; Risk management strategies; Vulnerability management; Risk management",,,,,,"Jouini, M., Rabai, L.B.A., Ben Aissa, A., Classification of security threats in information systems (2014) Procedia Comput.

In Indonesia alone, the issue of cyber security is certainly closely related to technological growth. In 2018 as many as 83.19% of Indonesia’s population are active internet users and as many as 26.26% of Indonesia’s population are smartphone users. When viewed positively, the use of technological developments can facilitate data collection so that existing data or information can be reused for interests that can benefit both organizations and individuals. This study aims to find out what factors influence smartphone users to open their personal information and provide access to mobile applications. These factors have been examined previously by Benson et al [1], which consists of 4 factors, namely Control Over Personal Information, Use of Information, and Privacy Notice that affect Information Disclosure, and using questionnaire techniques with 101 respondents. From the results obtained, it was found that the Personal Control Over, Use of Information, and Privacy Notice are the influential factors for individuals to open their information or not. In addition, when users know the function of information that is opened and get privacy notifications in advance, smartphone users will tend to open their personal information and give permissions to either mobile platforms or mobile applications to access personal information. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Control; Information disclosure; Privacy notice; Smartphone; Use of information",,,,,,,"Benson, V., Saridakis, G., Tennakoon, H., Information disclosure of social media users (2015) Inf.

Revenue growth is also declined because legacy services are tend to decreased due to threat from OTTs. Therefore we need a strategy to be able to withstand these conditions, one of which is a glance at the digital market. Strategy to offer digital services is developed in order to increase operators' revenue through offering of Machine to Machine (M2M) services, where potential and digital ecosystem support of those services is promising. In reality, implementation of those digital services is not yielding significant effect on operators' revenue growth, thus they need new strategy with a new service innovation. This research aims to modeling an M2M services, into a Smart Connected Motorbike (SCM) services. Furthermore, this research also analyzes business model implementation of this service as a study case at PT.XYZ, where this service is expected to become a new revenue source. From system modeling result and business model analysis, it is revealed that implementation of Smart Connected Motorbike services practices multi-sided platform business model pattern that brings together two different groups of customers which are motorbike users/buyers and corporate customers.

These programs are expected to have a positive outcome which is a better and increased teachers' competence. On the other hand, teacher's well-being might be disturbed by a negative impact from the program. This research aims to seek the subjective wellbeing of teachers in Jakarta and how to help teachers reach its wellbeing. The method use Neuroresearch (mix method), a mixture of qualitative research to build a theoretical construct and also observation as well as in-depth interviews with various parties and quantitative method by using measurement instruments subjective well-being Likert scale. The results found that (1) elementary teachers tend heading to wellbeing significantly at á <0.05 and (2) the cognitive dimension of teachers is an absolute determinant in shaping the well-being of primary school teachers. When a teachers cognitive is improved, then the wellbeing of primary school teachers will be increased by 20.983 from the current conditions. The study also found that the cognitive dimension is determined by the role of family situations and affective quality of teachers capable of acting 13.150 alters cognitive quality teachers.

For achieving consistency in the inconsistent matrix, researchers usually change the consistent ratio (CR) and the deviation matrix. The pursuit of a minimal CR is important, since this index directly measures the consistency matrix in the AHP. While the deviation matrix should be minimal such that the original opinion of the decision makes is preserved. Ideally, the both value of CR and deviation matrix should be minimal. However, in fact those two objectives will be conflicted if both of them are optimized simultaneously. Therefore, a non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-2 (NSGA-2) for solving the multi-objective problems is considered as an appropriate approach for solving this problem. Six inconsistent AHP matrices are successfully repaired using NSGA-2. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.","AHP; Consistent ratio; Genetic algorithm; NSGA-2","Analytic hierarchy process; Genetic algorithms; Hierarchical systems; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Consistent ratio; Multi objective; Multi-objective problem; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; NSGA-2; Problem solving",,,,,,"Saaty, T.L., (1980) The Analytic Hierarchy Process, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Saaty, T.L., (1984) Decision Making for Leaders, 7. , Esf Editeur; Girsang, A.S., Tsai, C.-W., Yang, C.-S., Ant algorithm for modifying an inconsistent pairwise weighting matrix in an analytic hierarchy process (2014) Neural Comput.

In the era of globalization, where the development of science and technology is so dynamic, the development of innovation system in a country is no longer possible. To succeed in the innovation system development, development system stakeholders must hold and promote the improvement of five factors: linkages, partnership, network, positive interaction and synergy as a key success factor. In the innovation network shows the success of innovation depends on the effective interaction. The interaction showed linkages for strengthening regional innovation system needs to be cultivated in supporting innovation and business activity and then become an innovation network. Interactions and relationships can be made by advances in information and communicationstechnology, where it is also one important factor to establish science and technology. Advances in information and communications technology contribute to promoting and realizing the potential of the region in facing and overcoming obstacles and challenges of region. Based on the observations of the importance of an innovation network in the region will need to be an analysis of inter-actor network conditions that support the strengthening of the Regional Innovation System. For the pilot area is the town of Cimahi (West Java). © 2015 The Authors.

Chat messenger application is used for android users to communicate through internet and have a chat such as line, whatsUp, blackberry messenger (BBM), yahoo messenger and so forth. In communicating via instant messages, some people may also experience problems when communicating with foreigners, of which at least the required skills in the English language. The purpose of this research is to build the application chat messenger fellow android user through internal operation office. The result shows that the application can translate automatically in different language. It also shows the application can achieve the good performance in CPU, RAM, GPU and bandwith usage. © 2017 IEEE.","Android; Google API; Internal chat messenger; Prototype","Computer science; Computers; Android; English languages; Google API; Instant messages; Internal chat messenger; Internal operations; Prototype; Rapid communication; Android (operating system)",,,,,"Filbert, J., (2010) Developing A Multi-Purpose Chat Application for Mobile Distributed Systems on Android Platform.

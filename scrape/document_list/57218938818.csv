This study observed non-finance Kompas100 listed firms from 2011 to 2015. Using a set of sampling criteria, a final sample size of 56 firms was determined. The voluntary disclosure level was measured by a modified Botosan index. A content analysis of sample annual reports was undertaken to determine the voluntary disclosure index of the firms under study. The firm valuation was proxied by the firms' share prices. Pooled OLS regression analyses were employed to analyse the data. The result showed that the firms' aggregate voluntary disclosure index (VDI) was valued positively in the market. Consistent results had been generated even after controlling for the firms' size and leverage. Further analysis of individual voluntary disclosure showed that three of seven voluntary disclosure categories were found to be the main value-driven categories, namely, key non-finance statistics, R&D activities and value-added disclosures. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Firm valuation; IDX; Kompas100; Voluntary disclosure; Voluntary disclosure score index",,,,,,"The authors wish to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika journal team that help publish this article.","Botosan, C.

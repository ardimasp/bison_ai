The background of this study is nowadays architectural development does not support ecology, people start to build something that will benefit in the market and ignore the importance of the state of the organic environment for the overall environment and landscapes only play a role in natural beauty. So, promoting and applying the elements of the garden and plants as a part of healing garden becomes an important issue and it must be borne in mind when designing landscapes in order to support eco architecture awareness. This paper provides essential benefit for humankind through healing garden. Precisely, the results of this paper indicate specific elements on plants' nature variety of place within the mentioned garden. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","eco architecture awareness; elements; healing garden; landscapes; plants","Architecture; Chemical elements; Architecture designs; eco architecture awareness; Healing gardens; Jakarta; landscapes; Natural beauty; plants; Plants (botany)",,,,,"Bergman, D., (2012) Sustainable Design, A Critical Guide; Lyengar, K., (2015) Sustainable Architectural Design, An Overview; Severtsen, B., (2006) Healing Gardens.

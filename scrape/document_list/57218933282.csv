Competitive pressure requires the bank to improve its performance. Banking health refers to the state of the bank and its organisational model. This research explored Indonesian banking behaviour based on a sample of 78 banks from which panel data were collected from 2008 to 2017. The panel data regression analysis showed that Indonesian banking behaviour was determined by the intensity of sales (SELL). This is influenced by the number of bank branches or the ability of the bank to reach consumers in Indonesia (SHARE). The coefficient value of 2.16 indicates the positive relationship between SHARE and SELL. The ability to approach consumers all over Indonesia is not only determined by the number of bank branches but also how banks can direct their technology spendings such as interactive websites, applications and electronic banking systems to secure and increase its customer base. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Banking behaviour; Digital era; The intensity of sales",,,,,,"The authors wish to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika journal team that help publish this article.","Devi Juwaheer, T., Pudaruth, S., Ramdin, P., Factors influencing the adoption of internet banking: A case study of commercial banks in Mauritius (2012) World Journal of Science, Technology and Sustainable Development, 9 (3), pp. 204-234; Estrella-Ramon, A., Sánchez-Pérez, M., Swinnen, G., How customers' offline experience affects the adoption of online banking (2016) Internet Research, 26 (5), pp. 1072-1092; Firdaus, M., (2011) Aplikasi ekonometrika untuk data panel dan time series [Econometrics application for panel data and time series], , Bogor, Indonesia: Departemen Ilmu Ekonomi FEM IPB; Hasibuan, S.

In general, the cooling loads are from internal and external heat. The external heat plays significantly in determining the cooling load; therefore, it is necessary to reduce the amount of solar radiation received by the external surface of the building. The objective of the paper is to investigate the reduction of solar radiation received by the surface of the multi-storey office building by applying parametric design study and to add a building envelope as the secondary skin as well as the architectural element. There are two steps of analysis in the methodology, (1) to conduct solar radiation analysis, and (2) to conduct building facade analysis. In the process, four alternatives form were simulated to obtain the most optimum shape in relation to the incident solar radiation reduction. The final parametric study results of the solar radiation and building facade analysis showed that the reduction of the irradiance is around 25% with the additional facades. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","irradiance reduction; office building; parametric facade","Air conditioning; Cooling; Facades; Office buildings; Architectural element; Building envelopes; Building facades; External surfaces; Irradiance level; Parametric design; Parametric study; Radiation analysis; Incident solar radiation",,,,,"(2018) Handbook of Energy and Economic, , https://www.esdm.go.id/en/publication/handbook-of-energy-and-economic, Kementrian ESDM (Oktober 2) Retrieved from Kementrian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral Republik Indonesia; (2016) Panduan Penerapan Bangunan Gedung Hijau, , https://greenbuilding.jakarta.go.id, Green Building Jakarta (September 23) Retrieved from Jakarta Green Building; Woodbury, R., (2010) Elements of Parametric Design; Anton, I., Tanase, D., Informed Geometries.

Building material decomposed in various time, some of it even take hundreds of years. This paper focus on the recycling metal waste material in form of perforated metal that used as building facade element. As we know that sustainable architecture not a simple design, and because of the lack of information until no interest in trying to execute the sustainable concept. Building material in metal form can be recycled and reused more easily thanks to the advanced technology invented. Perforated metal that can be designed in various ways and size can be used as building facade that enhance not only building performance but also the aesthetic aspect which emerged from the building. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","building facade; perforated metal; recycled material","Building materials; Facades; Recycling; Advanced technology; Building facades; Building performance; Know-that; Recycled materials; Run outs; Sustainable architecture; Metals",,,,,"Hegger, M., (2002) Construction Materials Manual; Munn, S., Soebarto, V., The issues of using recycled materials in architecture (2004) Issue Context of Architecture, pp. 161-167; Amponsah, N., Impact of building material recycle or reuse on selected emergy ratios (2012) Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 67, pp. 9-17; Rathmann, K., (1997) Recycling and Reuse of Builidng Materials; Schittich, C., (2006) Detail Building Skins; New life of the building materials-recycle, reuse and recovery (2015) Energy Procedia, 75, pp. 2884-2891. , W.

The Indonesian Statistics Bureau data showed that accidents involving motorcycles were dominated by young age. In line with government regulations, this paper discusses safety riding behavior among college students. A questionnaire distributed to college students and obtained 228 valid respondents with average age were 21 years old (71% male, 29% female). The questionnaire consists general information, driving attitude tendency (RA), safety driving (SR) behavior, riding knowledge (RK), and emotional intelligence (EI). This study showed that SR tendency of college students is moderate. A driving license(s) owned (DL) influence the riding knowledge (RA) with p-value=0.004. However, RA, SR, and EI are not different between age, gender and study years. Using a binary logistic regression, SR level predicted well by RA (p-value=0.000) with 93.3% accuracy. Based on this study, the participants with good RA, 1.185 times more likely will have good SR level. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","Driving attitude; Driving knowledge; Emotional intelligence; Safety Riding","Accidents; Emotional intelligence; Laws and legislation; Logistic regression; Surveys; Average ages; Behavior tendencies; Binary logistic regression; College students; Driving license; General information; Government regulation; Indonesia; Students",,,,,,"(2018) Statistik Transportasi Jakarta 2018, , https://jakarta.bps.go.id/publication/2018/10/03/cb1285d8dbe8be8754a5830d/statistik-transportasi-dki-jakarta-2018.html, 03 10 Online.Available: Accessed 25 01 2020; Issa, Y., Effect of driver's personal characteristics on traffic accidents in tabuk city in Arabia (2016) The Journal of Transport Literature, pp. 25-29; White, M.J., Cunningham, L.C., Titchener, K., Young driver' optimism bias for accident risk and driving skill: Accountability and insight experience manipulations (2011) Accident Analysis and Prevention, pp. 1309-1315; Lucidi, F., Mallia, L., Gainnini, A.M., Sgalla, R., Lazuras, L., Chirico, A., Alivernini, F., Vionani, C., Riding the adolescence: Personality subtypes in young moped riders and their association with risky driving attitudes and behaviors (2019) Frointier Pshychology, 10 (300), pp. 1-12; Wedagama, D.M.P., The Influence of Young and Male Motorist accidents – Factors on Motorcycle Injuries in Bali- (2009) IATSS Research, 3 (2); Simmons, W.O., Welki, A.M., Zlatoper, T.J., The impact of driving knowledge on motor vehicle fatalities (2016) JTRF, 55 (1); Cordellieri, P., Sdoia, S., Ferlazzo, F., Sgalla, R., Giannini, A.M., Driving attitudes.

The applications are not only as a hub between drivers to passengers but also as a hub for food and goods delivery services. Nowadays, motorbike taxi app-based is much closed to Jakarta citizen's daily activities. Based on those conditions, a number of motorbike taxi drivers in Jakarta can support a safe driving behavior among citizen. The promotion is part of a Government program in reducing traffic accidents. This study examines the association between workload (WL), emotional intelligence (EI), and fatigue (F) to certain driving behavior (ADB). The objective of the study tried to find out whether the current driving behavior of drivers relevant to support Government programs in reducing traffic accidents. A set of questionnaires with a Likert scale 1-5 was used as a research instrument. A sample of 201 app-based motorbike taxi drivers was involved. The participants answered a survey that includes an adapted version of a Driving behavior questionnaire (DBQ), the Prosocial and aggressive driving inventory (PADI), and a Driving activity load index (DALI). The result showed that drivers' driving behavior categorized into aggressive, with the level of workload, fatigue, and emotional intelligence are respectively low, moderate, and moderate to high. Utilizing Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), it was found that aggressive driving behavior could be predicted through EI. The fatigue (F) proved as mediating associations between WL and ADB, and between EI and ADB. Based on the result, the potential of the app-based motorbike taxi community to become a pioneer in safe driving behavior is quite good. They can help government in promoting safe driving behavior to the citizen. © 2020 IEEE.","Aggressive driving behavior; App-based motorbike driver; Emotional intelligence; Fatigue; Workload","Accidents; Emotional intelligence; Information management; Least squares approximations; Surveys; Aggressive driving; Aggressive driving behaviors; Driving behavior questionnaire; Government projects; Partial least square (PLS); Reducing traffic accidents; Research instruments; Structural equation modeling; Taxicabs",,,,,,"Ady, W., Astuti, W., Manan, A., The relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty: Evidence on online transportation services in Indonesia (2019) Ijasre, 5, pp. 214-222; (2018) Land Transportation Statistics 2018, , https://www.bps.go.id/publication/2019/11/27/7fdd3379108b4a60e046f4c8/statistik-transportasi-darat-2018.html, Retrieved from; Fountas, G., Pantangi, S.S., Hulme, K.F., Anastasopoulos, P.C., The effects of driver fatigue, gender, and distracted driving on perceived and observed aggressive driving behavior: A correlated grouped random parameters bivariate probit approach (2019) Analytic Methods in Accident Research, 22, pp. 1-15; Haerani, S., Sudirman, I., Hakim, W., Adji, A.S., Parmitasari, R.A., Amin, N., Aunalal, Z.I., Mediation effect of driving behavior on personality influence toward driving outcomes in Indonesia (2017) International Journal of Human Rights in Heal; Sucha, M., Chernocova, D., Driver personality as a valid predictor of risky driving (2016) Transportation Research Procedia, 14, pp. 4286-4295; Hafizhudin, Z., Indrawati, E.S., The relationship between social identity and aggressive behavior of rx-king community in semarang (hubungan antara identitas sosial dengan perilaku mengemudi agresif pada komunitas motor rx-king di semarang) (2016) Jurnal Empati, 5, pp. 683-686; Rosydah, B.M., Kurniasih, D., San, R., The effect of individual characteristics and environment to the aggressive behavior of public transportation driver in surabaya (efek karakteristik individu dan pengaruh lingkungan terhadap perilaku aggressive driving pada pengemudi angkutan umum di kota surabaya) (2017) Seminar Mater PPNS, 2, pp. 15-18; Harris, B.P., Houston, M.J., Vazquez, J.A., Smither, J.A., Harms, A., The prosocial and aggressive driving inventory (padi): A self-report measure of safe and unsafe driving behaviors (2014) Accident Analysis & Prevention, 72, pp. 1-8; Harvey, C., Stanton, N.A., (2013) Usability Evaluation for In-Vehicle Systems, , U.

The driving behavior influences by demographic aspects, fatigue, work condition, and others. To correct a behavior tendency, it is important to enhance the understanding of the influence of the demographic aspect to some factors related to the behavior tendency. This study was intended to measure the effect of age, driving experience, and time on task per trip to the workload (WL), fatigue (F), recovery needs (KP), and emotional intelligent (EI) as factors that influence driving behavior (DD). A set of questions as a research instrument was composed based on various literature. The instrument distributed to inter-city bus drivers from several bus companies. A total of 201 responds to questionnaires were obtained, but only 167 data processed further. The reliability of this instrument is quite good as indicated by the alpha Cronbach of 0.733 and the significant internal consistency result. The Kruskal Wallis test result showed that there were no differences among the above variables based on age groups (<35 y, 35-45 y, and> 45y). However, emotional intelligence differed between driving experience groups (<5 y, 5-10 y,> 10 y) and between time on task per trip (<3 hr, 3-5 hr,> 5 hr). The fatigue level also expressed differently of times on task per trip. Based on the result, it suggested to include emotional intelligence assessment in a corrected tendency behavior. The result also emphasized on time on task as a primary factor in fatigue mitigation to minimize risk accident. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","bus drivers; driving behavior; emotional intelligence; fatigue; workload","Accidents; Bus drivers; Buses; Fatigue of materials; Population statistics; Surveys; Behavior tendencies; Driving behavior; Driving experiences; Fatigue mitigation; Internal consistency; Kruskal-Wallis tests; Research instruments; workload; Emotional intelligence",,,,"Binus University","This study is supported by Indonesia Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education as part of PenelitianUnggulanPerguruanTinggi Research Grant to Binus University with contract number :","Da Silva, F.P., Santos, J., Meireles, A., Road Accident: Driver Behavior, Learning and Driving Task (2004) Procedia Soc.

In this study, the operator's work posture analysis, as well as an evaluation of three main production activities at the petrochemical company in Qatar, were conducted. The main objective is to assess the risks carried out by panel & field operators. This assessment is important to maintain the operator's productivity within the industrial system context. A Nordic questionnaire was applied to collect information on Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) symptoms from 34 operators, while Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) and Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) was utilized to analyze risks of work postures. How operators perceived their workload was also evaluated using NASA-TLX. About 79% of operators suffered from shoulder pain, 70% suffered a waist disorder as a symptom of MSDs, and it can cause disrupted productivity in the long run. The operators' posture during performing their tasks was identified as a high level of risk and requires immediate action based on RULA and REBA scores. To reduce MSDs symptoms and posture risk scores, a portable platform and handle wheel chain was proposed. Based on NASA-TLX result the operators perceived that workload as somewhat high to high with score 49-60 on average (scale 1-100). Addition outsourced personnel was suggested to decrease the workload level in a certain operation. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Ethylene Dichloride; musculoskeletal disorders; Nasa-TLX; Nordic questionnaire; REBA; RULA","Aliphatic compounds; Diseases; Ethylene; Musculoskeletal system; NASA; Petrochemicals; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Polyols; Productivity; Surveys; Ethylene dichloride; Musculoskeletal disorders; NASA-TLX; Nordic questionnaire; REBA; RULA; Risk assessment",,,,,,"Lock, F., Hansson, G., Nogueira, H.C., Enquist, H., Holtermann, A., Oliveira, A.N., Biomechanical exposure of industrial workers-influence of automation process (2018) International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, 67, pp. 41-52; Abdullah, N.H., Hamid, N.A.A., Wahab, E., Shamsuddin, A., Asmawi, R., Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorder (WRMD) among Production Operators: Studies of Differences in Age and Gender (2017) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1049; Al-Qaisi, S., Aghazadeh, F., The effects of valve-handwheel height and angle on neck, shoulder, and back muscle loading (2018) International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, 64, pp. 69-78; Alasim, H.N., Nimbarte, A.D., Jaridi, M., Impact of pulling direction and magnitude of force exertion on the activation of shoulder muscles (2019) International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, 69, pp. 14-22; Al Thani, A., Mohammad, S.A., Alam, W.M., (2009) Heat Stress Guidelines & Recommendation Heat Stress Pevention and Management Workshop, , http://www.ashghal.gov.qa/en/Documents/ADs/Current%20ADs/Heat%20Stress/HeatStress_E.pdf; Hart, S.G., Nasa-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX); 20 Years Later (2006) Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting, 50; Nurmianto, E., Ciptomulyo, U., Suparno, Kromodihardjo, S., Manual handling problem identification in mining industry: An Ergonomic perspective (2015) Procedia Manufacturing, 4, pp. 89-97; Rmd, Z., Azis, N.A., Saptari, A., Kamat, S.R., A Survey on Working Postures among Malaysian Industrial Workers (2015) Procedia Manufacturing, 2, pp. 450-459; Lakhwinder, P.S., (2016) Work Study and Ergonomic: Work Posture Assessment Using Rapid Entire Body Assessment Tool (REBA); Middlesworth, M., (2017) A Step by Step Guide to the REBA Assessment Tool.

However, in the transportation sector, safety is still a serious problem and requires attention. Road accidents in Indonesia with a high fatality mostly involve intercity buses. Most of the accidents are reportedly caused by human error, typically caused by a fatigued driver. To understand the factors that influence general fatigue (F), three variables-subjective workload (WL), need for recovery (NR), and emotional intelligence (EI)-are discussed by considering time on task and time of day as factors. To assess the perceptions of 298 intercity bus drivers, this research was conducted using a questionnaire. There are statistically significant differences in the NR (p = 0.001) and EI level (p = 0.001) among the time on task group (less than three hours, three to five hours, and longer than five hours) but not for the WL. Meanwhile, for the time of day group (driving in the morning, afternoon, and at night) there are no significant differences of WL (p = 0.161), NR (p = 0.795), and EI level (p = 0.271). A Tukey post hoc test revealed that the NR and is statistically significantly higher for a duration longer than three hours (p = 0.025 and p = 0.000). Binomial logistic regression was run to understand the influence of WL, NR, and EI on subjective fatigue level, categorized into fatigue (1) and alert (0). The Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed that the model fit the data well, p = 0.673. The variables NR (p = 0.08) and EI (p = 0.020) statistically significantly predict general fatigue subjectively. Based on these results, EI and NR are suggested as factors that should be analyzed further concerning the issue of fatigue-related accidents. Both factors should also be considered in company's fatigue management system. © 2020 Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia.","Emotional intelligence; Fatigue; Intercity bus drivers; Need for recovery; Workload",,,,,"Binus University: 12/AKM/PNT/2019, 225/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019, 039/VR","This study is supported by the Indonesia Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education as part of the Penelitian Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University with contract number: 225/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019; 12/AKM/PNT/2019;039/VR.RTT/IV/2019 dated 27 March 2019.","Agresti, A., (2002) Categorical Data, , New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons; Bartlett, J.E., Kotrlik, J.Y., Higgins, C.C., Organizational Research: Determining Appropriate Sample Size in Survey Research (2001) Information Technology, Learning, and Performance Journal, 19 (1), pp. 43-50; Chen, C., Zhang, J., Exploring Background Risk Factors for Fatigue Crashes Involving Truck Drivers on Regional Roadway Networks: A Case Control Study in Jiangxi and Shaanxi, China (2016) Springer Plus, 5 (582), pp. 1-12; Craig, A., Tran, Y., Wijesuriya, N., Nguyen, H., Regional Brain Wave Activity Changes Associated with Fatigue (2012) Psychophysiology, 49 (4), pp. 547-582; da Costa, D.G., Malkhamah, S., Suparma, L.B., Use of the Safety Factor and Margin of Safety in Motorcyclist Accident Risk Management (2018) International Journal of Technology, 9 (4), pp. 737-750; Dawson, D., Reynolds, A.C., van Dongen, H.P., Thomas, M.J., Determining the Likelihood that Fatigue was Present in a Road Accident: A Theoretical Review and Suggested Accident Taxonomy (2018) Sleep Medicine Reviews, 42, pp. 202-210; de Vries, J., Michielsen, H.J., van Heck, G.L., Assessment of Fatigue among Working People: A Comparison of Six Questionnaires (2003) Occupational Environment Medicine, 60, pp. 10-15; Di Milia, L., Smolensky, M., Costa, G., Howarth, H., Ohayon, M., Philip, P., Demographic Factors, Fatigue, and Driving Accidents: An Examination of the Published Literature (2011) Accident Analysis and Prevention, 43 (2), pp. 516-532; Ferguson, S.A., Paech, G., Sargent, C., Darwent, D., Kennaway, D., Roach, G., The Influence of Circadian Time and Sleep Dose on Subjective Fatigue Ratings (2012) Accident Analysis and Prevention, 45S, pp. 50-54; Friswell, R., Williamson, A., Comparison of the Fatigue Experiences of Short Haul Night and Long Distance Heavy Vehicle Drivers (2013) Safety Science, 57, pp. 203-213; Gastaldi, M., Rossi, R., Gecchele, G., Effects of Driver Task-related Fatigue on Driving Performance (2011) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 111, pp. 955-964; Gilar-Corb, R., Pozo-Rico, T., Sánchez, B., Castejón, J.-L., Can Emotional Intelligence be improved?.

It is influenced by time on task (TOT) and time of day (TOD). Recent electroencephalogram (EEG) research on fatigue assessment has shown a promising result in explaining the fatigue phenomenon. However, different findings exist regarding the best EEG parameters related to fatigue. This study examined EEG changes according to the effect of TOT and TOD and determined the best parameters to distinguish fatigue status. To generate driver fatigue, prolonged driving in the morning and at night in a simulator was conducted. The EEG signal was collected from 28 male participants at frontal and occipital areas. The EEG power (brainwave) was determined from the first and last 5 minutes of the driving task and after a break of 30 minutes. The results of this study showed a general tendency of EEG power changing throughout the driving sessions. However, changes related to fatigue were only found for the night sessions, as confirmed by θ power and the subjective fatigue measurement result. This study showed that TOT (as a factor that induces fatigue) was explained by θ from the frontal area, whereas TOD was differentiated by α, θ, θ/β, (θ+α)/β and (θ+α)/(β+α). © 2019 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.","EEG;

Driving style not only relates to a risk that people may involve but it also may relate to preserving the eco-driving behavior. This study proposed a quantification of the behavior along with risky drivers' behavior. The study involved a number of residents in some cities in Indonesia and conducted using a translated Manchester Driving Behavior questionnaire (MDBQ). About 89 collected filled questionnaire (68.5% male, 31.5% female) analyzed in this study. Based on reliability and validity test, questions Q2, Q3, Q8, Q10, and Q15 removed from further analysis, with final Cronbach's alpha value = 0.946. There were 12 questions that similar with an eco-driving behavior on the adapted MDBQ (as variable 1), and the remaining 33 questions treated as variable 2 which represented a risky driving behavior. This study showed that the participants has low to medium level of risky behavior and medium eco driving behavior. The statistical test revealed a significant correlation between those variables (r = 0.727; p<0.01). It confirm that less eco-driving behavior (indicated by higher answer's score) has a close relation with risky driving behavior. Increasing awareness of safe driving during eco-driving behavior training is suggested, and hopefully, it will increase the training success rate in long-term in the formed the expected behavior. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The nature of the work in some industries are more risky compared to other industries, and oil& gas Company is one of them especially for their field worker. Actually, most of company is very strict in safety supervision because the consequences can be fatal, however som accidents may still experience by workers. The company is not only concern about the safety but also set high performance and productivity on their employee. Employee awareness of how important of those three factors could help company to achieve the goal. In this study, how performance, productivity, safety and health at workplace perceived by operator and supervisor/manager at oil & gas company in Qatar is discussed, and their correlation was measured. A questionnaire consist of 45 questions related to performance, productivity, safety and health, was applied to caputer the perception of oil & gas company's employee who located at 4 sites. There are 212 participants involved in the survey (155 operators, and 57 supervisors/manager). Based on their answer, the study showed that performance and productivity level of the employee can be categorize as high (82% and 85%), while the safety and health level at the company is perceived in good condition (by 86% employee). Using multiple linear regression, significant correlation productivity and performance with safety and health condition is found (p < 0.05). In addition, Two Way ANOVA conducted to see the differences perception among age group and years-of-duty group. It revealed the differences exist based on p<0.1. This study showed that employee for each site (Dukhan, Ras Laffan, Doha, and Offshore Umm Said) realizes how the importance of performance, productivity, and safety in work even though the perception may differ among the group. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In Indonesia this issue received less attention from citizen, whereas it has significant roles in reducing greenhouse gas emission. This paper initiated a study about eco-driving tendency behavior among Indonesian people, the objective is to see whether current behavior support or not, and does the differences between gender and age exist. Adopted on-line study method using an online form questionnaire, 27 questions developed consist of 8 items related to individual data, 19 items related to perception and driving behavior. The respond measures using 5 scale option answers (i.e. strongly disagree, disagree, quite agree, agree, and strongly agree). Based on average respondents' answers, can be concluded that the tendency of behavior somewhat supports to in line with eco-driving behavior. After Q15 and Q18 omitted based on Pearson-product moment correlation, further analysis results showed that most of respondents categorized into mild tendency behavior (109 respondents). However, a mild tendency among female respondents are higher than male, and the strong tendency of males is higher than female respondents. Based on gender, there are no significant tendency behavior differences between male and female (p-value = 0, 320), and also among age groups (30y, 31-40y, 41-50y, and >50y), even though age >50 have a lower tendency to the behavior compare to other groups. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Greenhouse gases; Age groups; Current behaviors; Driving behavior; Eco-driving; Environmental awareness; Indonesia; Product-moment correlation; Study methods; Behavioral research",,,,,,"Ando, R., Nishihori, Y., How does driving behavior change when following an eco-driving car (2011) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 20, pp. 577-587; Delhomme, P., Cristea, M., Paran, F., Self-reported frequency and perceived difficulty of adopting eco-friendly driving behavior according to gender, age, and environmental concern (2013) Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 20, pp. 55-58; Lai, W.-T., The effects of eco-driving motivation, knowledge and reward intervention on fuel efficiency (2015) Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 34, pp. 155-160; Jamson, S.L., Hibberd, D.L., Jamson, A.H., Drivers' ability to learn eco-driving skills; Effects on fuel efficient and safe driving behaviour (2015) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 58, pp. 657-668; Transportation and Global Warming, , http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/climate_law_institute/transportation_and_global_warming, Center for Biological Diversity, [Online], [Accessed 3 August 2017]; (2017) Source of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, , https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions, Agency, U.

Profiles of the drivers involved in the accidents are not typically available, and studies covering this subject are also limited. In this paper, Indonesian road transportation will be discussed, particularly with respect to traffic accidents and the associated characteristics of the drivers. Also of interest is the description of certain demographic aspects and their relation to road accidents. Data were collected from the news, along with an online survey of 138 commercial drivers, 10% of whom were female). It was found that spending an inordinate amount of time driving per week induces sleepiness and fatigue and is considered as one of the prime causes of accidents. It was also determined that lack of concentration was one of the dominant (~51%) causes. Differences in age, gender, and driving experience did not seem to be related to the likelihood of accidents. © 2017 IJTech.","Driver characteristics; Driving hours; Fatigue and sleepiness; Road accidents",,,,,,,"Al-Houqani, M., Eid, H.O., Abu-Zidan, F.M., Sleep-related Collisions in United Arab Emirates (2013) Accidents Analysis & Prevention, 50, pp. 1052-1055; Auditya, M., (2016) Seriously, Number of Traffic Accident in Indonesia at Alarming Rate, , http://www.otomania.com/read/2016/03/17/162000830/Gawat, Angka.

Nowadays, restaurant industry does not only offer good food, but also a pleasant experience and hospitality. To assess how restaurants employees in Indonesia perceived fatigue related to their job, assessment conducted using Swedish Occupational Fatigue Index (SOFI) in Indonesian language. The study involved 180 employees from 9 casual dining restaurants. Translated SOFI has good reliability and validity test result based on Cronbach Alpha value and internal consistency coefficient. Using F-test, the null hypothesis is rejected, and it can be concluded that the fatigue level of each dimension and employees from each restaurant is different. The greatest level of fatigue experienced by employees from restaurant ninth and employees from restaurant first is the lowest. Level of fatigue was acceptable (light to moderate), as indicated by the average value for most dimensions (less than 3.5 on scale of 1-7). © 2015 IEEE.","fatigue; restaurant employees; SOFI","Personnel; Average values; Cronbach alpha; Fatigue level; Indonesian languages; Internal consistency; Null hypothesis; Reliability and validity; SOFI; Fatigue of materials",,,,,,"Saito, K., Measurement of fatigue in industries (1999) Industrial Health, pp. 13-42. , Apr. 37; Leung, A.W.S., Chan, C.C.H., He, J., Structural stability and reliability of the Swedish occupational fatiue inventory among Chinese VDT workers (2004) Applied Ergonomics, 35, pp. 233-241; Marcora, S.M., Staiano, W., Manning, V., Mental fatigue impairs physical performance in humans (2009) Journal Application Plysiologi, 106, pp. 857-864; Boksem, M.A.S., Meijman, T.F., Lorist, M.M., Effects of mental fatigue on attention: An ERP study (2005) Cognitive Brain Research, 25, pp. 107-116; Borghini, G., Vecchiato, G., Toppi, J., Astolfi, L., Maglione, A., Isabella, R., Caltagirone, C., Babiloni, F., Assesment of mental fatigue during car driving by using high resolution EEG activity and neruphysiologic indices (2012) Annual International Conference of the IEEE EMBS, , Diego, California USA, 28 Agustus-1 September; Lal, S.K.L., Craig, A., Driver fatigue: Psychological and electroencephalography assessment (2002) Pshychophysiology, 39 (3), pp. 313-321; Zhao, X., Rong, J., The relationship between driver fatigue and monotonous road environment (2013) Atlantis Computational Intelligence System, 8, pp. 19-36. , Atlantis Press; Ahsberg, E., Gamberale, F., Gustafsson, K., Perceived fatigue after mental work: An experimental evaluation of a fatigue inventory (2000) Ergonomics, 43 (2), pp. 252-268; Steege, L.M.B., Nussabaum, M.A., Dimension of fatigue as predictors of performance: A structural equation modelling approach among registered nurses (2013) IIE Transaction on Occupational Ergonomics and Human Factors, pp. 16-30; Mathiassen, S.E., Hialman, D.M., Lyskov, E., Hygee, S., Can cognitive activities during breaks in repetitive manual work accelerate recovery from fatigue a controlled experiment (2014) Plos One, , November 6; Gutiérrez, L.G., Jiménez, B.M., Hernández, E.G., López, A.L., Spanish version of the swedish occupational fatigue inventory (sofi); Factorial replication, reliability and validity (2005) International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, 35, pp. 737-746; Johns, M.W., What is excessive daytime sleepiness (2009) Sleep Deprivation, Causes, Effects and Treatment, , Nova Science Publisher, Inc; Williamson, A., Lombardi, D.A., Folkard, S., Stuts, J., Courtney, T.K., Connor, J.L., The link between fatigue and safety (2011) Accident Analysis and Prevention, 43, pp. 498-515; Otsuka, Y., Tatemaru, M., Working hours and psychological health among Japanese restaurant service worker (2010) International Journal of Psychology and Counseling, 2 (4), pp. 65-71; Juan, H., Perez, J.N.S., Maldona, A.A., Garcia-Alcaraz, J.L., Demographic factors affecting perceived fatigue level among cnc lathe operators (2014) Proceeding of 5th International Conference on Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics AHFE, , Poland",,,,"IEEE Computer Society","IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management, IEEM 2015","6 December 2015 through 9 December 2015",,119262,21573611,9781467380669,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Such is the phenomena in the transportation industry, in which higher accident rates occur at certain times of day. This study examined driver's fatigue following morning (E1) and afternoon (E2) driving tasks performed using a driving simulator. Nine male university students (aged 20-22 years old) participated in this study, and were asked to drive for 60 minutes (in random fashion) between 9-11 am and 3-5 pm in a very dense traffic conditions. Fatigue was assessed by measuring changes in blood pressure, heart rate, salivary amylase, and ratings of sleepiness and fatigue. Findings from this study generally indicated that driving for 60 minutes was sufficient in inducing fatigue phenomenon. It also confirm the relationship of sleepiness with fatigue driving, and other physiological changes during experiment. Furthermore, driving in late afternoon could result in greater increase in fatigue when compared with the same tasks performed during morning hours. This study suggests taking times of day into consideration when managing and scheduling driving jobs. © IEOM Society International. © IEOM Society International.","Driver fatigue; KSS; Sleepiness; Time-of-day",,,,,,,"Radun, I., Radun, J.E., Convicted of fatigue driving: Who, why, and how (2009) Accident Analysis and Prevention, 41, pp. 869-875; Williamson, A., Friswell, R., Oliver, J., Grzebieta, R., Are drivers aware of sleepiness and increasing crash risk while driving (2014) Accident Analysis and Prevention, 70, pp. 225-234; May, J.F., Baldwin, J.L., Driver fatigue: The importance of identifying causal factors (2009) Transportation Research Part F., 12, pp. 218-224; Salinen, M., Harma, M., Akila, R., Holm, A., Luukkonen, R., Mikola, H., Muller, K., Virkkala, J., The Effects of sleep debt and monotonous work on sleepiness and performance during a 12-h dayshift (2004) Journal Sleep Research, 13, pp. 285-294; Williamson, A., Lombardi, D.A., Folkard, S., Stuts, J., Courtney, T.K., Connor, J.L., The link between fatigue and safety (2011) Accident Analysis and Prevention, 43, pp. 498-515; Lenne, M.G., Trigss, T.J., Redman, J.R., Time of day variations in driving performance Accident Anaylsis & Preventon, 29 (4), pp. 431-437. , July 1997; Otmani, S., Pebayle, T., Roge, J., Muzet, A., Effect of driving duration and partial sleep deprivation on subsquent allertness and performance of car drivers (2005) Physiology & Behavior, 84, pp. 715-724; Di Milia, L., Kecklun, G., The distribution of sleepiness, sleep, and work hours during a long distance morning trip: a comparison between night-and non-night workers (2013), 53, pp. 17-23. , Accident Analys and Prevention; Lal, S.K., Craig, A., A critical review of psychophysiology of driver's fatigue (2001) Biological Psychology, 55, pp. 173-194; Benedetto, S., Pedrotti, M., Mini, L., Baccino, T., Re, A., Montanari, R., Driver workload and eye blink duration (2011) Transportation Research Part F, 14, pp. 199-208; Tanaka, M., Shigihara, Y., Funakura, M., Kanai, E., Watanabe, Y., Fatigue-associated alterations of cognivite function and electroencephaloghrapic power densities (2012) PloS One, 4; Ahsberg, E., Gamberale, F., Gustafsson, K., Perceived fatigue after mental work: an experimental evaluation of a fatigue inventory (2000) Ergonomics, 43 (2), pp. 252-268; Zuraida, R., Driver fatigue evaluation using Swedish Occupational Fatigue Index (SOFI): as study among driver Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) Jakarta Computer, Mathematics, and Engineering Application Journal, 6 (2), pp. 229-2223. , Juni 2015.

The burden of public vehicle drivers such bus driver is heavier, since they are dealing with the traffic during their work. Nowday, Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) becomes one of highly demanded transportation system for Jakartans and worker from urban area. In this background, research on fatigue from driving addressing BRT's driver becomes a critical issue in ensuring safe operation. In this study a workload evaluation, sleepiness, motivation level, self-rated fatigue and salivary amylase test was established to evaluate fatigue level of BRT driver from 2 different shifts (45 participants). Data collected directly during BRT's driver was on duty, before and after their services. Based on anova analysis, it reveals that different shift could affect fatigue levels (p<0,05) based on SOFI result, although workload each shift is similar. The study also show that 27% more driver are in stress condition before starting their task in morning-shift. Suprisingly, driver's motivation level among shift is not differ. As a conclusion, early shift had a larger influence on stress and sleepiness level on BRT driver, a rotation schedule may help to overcome the problem. © IEOM Society International. © IEOM Society International.","Driver fatigue; Shift; Stress; Time-of-day",,,,,,,"In year Sixth become more popular (2013) Bus Transjakarta Semakin Diminati di Usia ke-6, , www.jakarta.go.id/v2/news/2010/01/Bus-Transjakarta-Semakin-Diminati-di-Usia-ke-6#.UXc1Ia7pbRQ, from Jakarta.go.id; Aldrich, T.B., Szabo, S.M., Bierbaum, C.R., The development and application of model to predict operator workload during system design (1988), http://sunburst.usd.edu,http://sunburst.usd.edu/~schieber/psyc792/workload/Aldrich1988.pdf, Retrieved 5 20, 2013; Bierbaum, C., Szabo, S., Aldirch, T.B., Task Analysis of the UH-60 Mission and Decision Rules for Developing a UH-60 Workload Prediction Model (1989), US Army R&D Activity, Fort Rucker, AL; Yee, S., Nguyen, L., Green, P., Oberholtzer, J., Miller, B., Visual, Auditory, Cognitive, and Psychomotor Demands of Real In-Vehicle Tasks (2006), Technical Report, Univeristy of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, USA; Wickens, C.D., Multipe Resources and performance prediction (2002) Ergonomic Science, 3 (2), pp. 159-177; Williamson, A., Lombardi, D.A., Folkard, S., Stuts, J., Courtney, T.K., Connor, J.L., The link between fatigue and safety (2011) Accident Analysis and Prevention, 43, pp. 498-515; Ingre, M., Keclund, G., Åkerstedt, T., Keclund, L., Variation in Sleepiness during Early Morning Shifts; A Mixed Model Approach to an Experimental Field Study of Train Drivers (2004) Chronobiology International, 21 (6), pp. 973-990; Johns, M.W., What is Esxcessive Daytime Sleepiness (2009) Sleep Deprivation: Causes, Effects and Treatment, , Nova Science Publisher, Inc; Philip, P., Sagaspe, P., Moore, N., Taillard, J., Charles, A., Guilleminault, C., Bioulac, B., Fatigue, sleep restriction and driving performance (2005) Accident Analysis and Prevention, 37, pp. 473-478; Rupp, T., Concepts of Fatigue, Sleepiness, and Alertness (2013) Encyclopedia of Sleep, pp. 24-26; Shahid, A., Shen, J., Shapiro, C.M., Measurement of sleepiness and Fatigue (2010) Journal of Psychosomatic Research, 69, pp. 81-89; Shen, J., Barbera, J., Shapiro, C.M., Distinguish sleepiness and fatigue: focus on definition and measurement (2006) Sleep Medicine Reviews, 10, pp. 63-76; Kovalevent, R.D., Hinz, A., Brahler, E., Klapp, B.F., Determinant of Fatigue and Stress (2010) Biomedical Research Note, 4, p. 238; Hobson, J., Beach, J.R., An investigation of the relationship between psychological health and workload among managers (2000) Ocupational Med., 50 (7), pp. 518-522; Reyner, L.A., Wells, S.J., Mortlock, V., Horne, J.A., Post-lunch' sleepiness during prolonged, monotonous driving-effects of meal size (2012) Physiology & Behavior, 105, pp. 1088-1091; Minowa, C., Koitabashi, K., Salivary alpha-amylase activity-an Indicator of relaxation response in perioperative patients (2012) Open Journal of Nursing, 2, pp. 208-214; Connor, J., Whitlock, G., Norton, R., Jackson, R., Role of driver sleepiness in car crashes: a systematic review of epidemiological studies (2001) Accident Analysis and Prevention, 33, pp. 31-41; Kaida, K., Åkerstedt, T., Kecklund, G., Nilsson, J.P., Axesson, J., Use of subjective and Physiological Indicators of Sleepiness to Predict Performance during a Vigilance Task (2007) Industrial Health, 45, pp. 520-526; Yamaguchi, M., Kanmori, T., Kanemaru, M., Takai, N., Mizuno, Y., Yoshida, H., Performance evaluation of salivary amylase activity monitor Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 20, pp. 491-497; Sakabibra, T., Wang, Z., Kasai, Y., Does going to an amusement park alleviate low back pain?

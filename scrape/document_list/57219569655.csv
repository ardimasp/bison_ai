This is achieved through an automated itinerary planning using artificial intelligence of simulated annealing technique. In contrast, planning the itinerary in detail with manual process would be time consuming, disorganized and incomplete which might affect the travel experience negatively. The work presents comparison of manual approach and the proposed automated itinerary on a mobile system application; as well as cloud-architecture that will support the application's overall functionality, including the cloud-services that is used to support each component of the application. The result of incorporating meta heuristic in building the recommendation system which in return improving the user experience of the leisure travelling industry is promising and will be presented at the end of the paper. © 2020 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Meta heuristic; Simulated annealing; User experience","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Information management; Leisure industry; Simulated annealing; Cloud architectures; Cloud services; Itinerary planning; Manual process; Metaheuristic; Mobile systems; Simulated annealing techniques; Travel experiences; User experience",,,,,"We would like to extend our gratitude to BINUS University RTTO on its support towards this topic.","Bertsimas, D., Tsitsiklis, J., Simulated annealing (1993) Statistical Science, 8 (1), pp. 10-15; Zhan, S.-H., List-based simulated annealing algorithm for traveling salesman problem (2016) Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2016 (1), pp. 1-4; Samora, I., Simulated annealing in optimization of energy production in a water supply network (2016) Water Resources Management, 30 (4), pp. 1533-1547; Zhu, W., Shang, L., Li, P., Guo, H., Modified hill climbing mppt algorithm with reduced steady-state oscillation and improved tracking efficiency (2018) The Journal of Engineering, 2018 (17), pp. 1878-1883; Villamizar, M., Evaluating the monolithic and the microservice architecture pattern to deploy web applications in the cloud (2015) 2015 10th Computing Colombian Conference (10CCC); Robin, F., Anton, H., Performance characteristics between monolithic and microservice-based systems (2017) Blekinge Institute of Technology, pp. 1-7. , 06-2017; Ghofrani, J., Lübke, D., Challenges of microservices architecture: A survey on the state of the practice (2018) ZEUS., 2018, pp. 1-8; Taibi, D., Lenarduzzi, V., Pahl, C., Architectural patterns for microservices: A systematic mapping study (2018) SCITEPRESS, 2018, pp. 1-10; Balalaie, A., Heydarnoori, A., Jamshidi, P., Microservices architecture enables devops: Migration to a cloud-native architecture (2016) Ieee Software, 33 (3), pp. 42-52; Xu, R., Blendmas: A blockchain-enabled decentralized microservices architecture for smart public safety (2019) 2019 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain, IEEE, pp. 564-571; Omar, A., Peter, M., A comparative review of microservices and monolithic architecture (2018) Budapest University of Technology and Economics, 2018, pp. 1-5; Iqbaldeep, K., Navneet, K., Research paper on object oriented software engineering (2016) Chandigarh Engineering College, 4 (4); Markos, V., Ricardo, T., Microservices in practice: A survey study (2018) Conference: VI Workshop on Software Visualization, Evolution and Maintenance, 2018, pp. 1-8; Gastón, M., Hermán, A., Migrating from monolithic architecture to microservices, a rapid review (2018) International Conference of the Chilean Computer Science Society, SCCC 2019, 2019, pp. 1-3; Isak, S., Agni, D., The benefits of using google cloud computing for developing distributed applications (2015) Journal of Mathemathics and System Science, 5 (2015), pp. 156-214; Pinky, S., Naman, A., Introduction to machine learning and its basic application in python (2019) Proceedings of 10th International, 2019, pp. 1354-1375; Bangare, S.L., Gupta, S., Using node. js to build high speed and scalable backend database server, international journal of research in avdent technology (E-ISSN: 2321-9637) special issue national conference (2016) NCPCI-2016, pp. 61-63; Hezbullah, S., Tariq, R., Node. js challenges in implementation (2017) Global Journal of Computer Science and Technology: E Network, Web & Security, 17 (2), pp. 1-12. , version 1; Shiyi, W., Franceska, X., Empirical study of the dynamic behavior of javascript objects (2015) Wiley Online Library, 2015, pp. 867-889; Suraj, C., Google analytics-case study (2015) Eastern Institute of Technology, 2015, pp. 1-10",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","5th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2020","13 August 2020 through 14 August 2020",,163671,,9781728170718,,,"English","Proc.

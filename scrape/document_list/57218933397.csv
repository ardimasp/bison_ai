The research utilized the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model and relative importance analysis to achieve the objective. This research discovered that perceived trainer personality, perceived trainer knowledge, and perceived trainer participant engagement skills played important roles in design thinking training effectiveness - measured from trainees' perceptions of knowledge improvement, knowledge depth, and knowledge expectations. The relative importance analysis further showed that perceived trainer personality was ranked as the most important factor towards participants' perceptions of knowledge improvement; the research also found that perceived trainer engagement skills were seen as the most important factor in deep learning and satisfaction. The theoretical contributions and limitations are also discussed in the paper. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Corporate training; Design thinking; Indonesia; Trainers' attributes; Training effectiveness",,,,,,"The authors wish to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika journal team that help publish this article.","Aguinis, H., Kraiger, K., Benefits of training and development for individuals and teams, organizations, and society (2009) Annual Review of Psychology, 60, pp. 451-474; Amabile, T.

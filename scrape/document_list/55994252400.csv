Unfortunately, the Black-Scholes formulagenerally used in determining option price does not involve skewness.To calculate European option price, incomplete market model ischosen as a research instrument to determine the price using theEsscher transform and then convert it into the form of a linearapproximation to the calculation of the option price. The aims of thisstudy are to construct a linear approximation in option pricing withskewness effect and compare it to Black-Scholes option price. Theresult is linear approximation can predict the underlying assets onskewness effect accurately. © 2015 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.","European call option; Incomplete market; Linear approximation",,,,,,"Hull, J.C., (2012) Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives, , Pearson Prentice Hall, New Jersey; Haim, S., Doron, G., Hedging with stock index options: A mean-extended Gini approach (2013) Journal of Mathematical Finance, 3, pp. 119-129; Gerber, H.U., Laundy, G., Skewness and stock option prices (1997) North American Actuarial Journal, 1, pp. 50-58; Floroiu, O., Pelsser, A., Incomplete-market Prices for Real Estate, Department of Finance (2012) Maastricht University, , http://www.asb.unsw.edu.au/schools/bankingandfinance/Documents/O.%20Floroiu%20-%20Incomplete-Market%20Prices%20for%20Real%20Estate.pdf; Verchenk, O., Testing Option Pricing Models: Complete and Incomplete Market (2011) Kyiv School of Economics and Kyiv Economics Institute, Ukraine, , http://repec.kse.org.ua/pdf/KSE_dp38.pdf; Staum, J., Handbooks in OR and MS, Northwestern Univer (2008) Linear Approximation of Option Pricing in Incomplete Market 181, pp. 511-563. , Incomplete Markets, J.

Option price determination is affected by risk factor. However in Black-Scholes model option price is determined without arbitrage risk affection so it is impossible to take return. In this study, option price formula is constructed to be more represent the condition of financial market using incomplete market concept where financial asset, that is traded, is affected by arbitrage risk so it is possible for market participants to take return. European call option is defined by Esscher Transform method and option price formula is determined by changing its form to linear approximation. The result from this study is option price formula with linear approximation has some privileges. That is easy to be applied in computation process, more representatives in getting risk indication in the financial market and can predict option price more accurately. Linear approximation formula is applied in the program that can be used by option writer or holder and is equipped with export data feature that can be possible for further research development. © 2014 Science Publications.","European call option; Incomplete market; Linear approximation",,,,,,"Model investasi harga saham tipe eropa dengan menggunakan model black-scholes (2009), Unpublished Thesis, University of Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

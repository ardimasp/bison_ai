It empirically shows how the driving strategy, such as the braking distance, affects gasoline usage. The movement of vehicles in this work is computed by using the car-following model of the optimal velocity model. For the case of vehicles in a platoon, the model is implemented in an agent-based model. From the dynamic vehicle data, we estimate the fuel consumption by a regression model. We analyze cases involving one, two, and twenty vehicles moving in a platoon for various driving strategies. The result shows that strong braking on high vehicle speed leads to a surge in fuel consumption. The efficient driving condition can be maintained at various speeds given the braking distance is adjusted proportionally with speed. © 2020 ICIC International.","Agent-based modeling; Fuel consumption; Optimal velocity function; Optimal velocity model",,,,,,"Fontana, G., Galloni, E., Variable valve timing for fuel economy improvement in a small sparkignition engine (2009) Applied Energy, 86 (1), pp. 96-105; Bhoopalam, A.

The workers also can get physical injury risk such as Musculoskeletal Disorder (MSDs). To reduce the risk, it is necessary to analyze the work task through risk assessment to observe the posture during using the equipment such as rig up the Pressure Control Equipment (PCE) to determine the level of risk for each task, and the cumulative risk for each work cycle. This study uses the Postural Ergonomic Risk Assessment (PERA) method to analyze and measuring cyclic assembly work. We set the risk criteria for activity classification (A) into posture, duration, and force which divided into three groups (A<4 = Low risk, 4≤A≤ 7 = Possible risk, A≥7 = High risk). Time duration and stressed posture provide high risk exposure, whereas the workers manually operate and install the component and spare parts can lead to medium and low risk exposures. We found that the high potential risks to cause harm are when the workers operate Tree Adaptor Installation and BOP Installation. Whereas, the Making up Lubricator connection and PCE Secure Line Installation provide medium and low risk exposures, respectively. Our study can be guidance on the steps of prioritization and intervention to reduce the musculoskeletal risks. © IAEME Publication.","Musculoskeletal disorder; PCE; PERA; Risk analysis; Workspace design",,,,,,"Arjmand, N., Amini, M., Adi, A.S., Plamondon, A., Parnianpour, M., Revised NIOSH lifting equation may generate spine loads exceeding recommended limits (2015) International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, pp. 1-8;

Cellroom has a very large number of valves that vary greatly in terms of model, service and size but in one place that is not wide so that the valve location is often close together sometimes even coincide. The objective of this research is to analysis work posture using RULA method on operator cellroon electrolyser. Valve layout that is difficult to reach and heavy rotation to operate also sometimes the operator must squat and bend when operating most of the valves. The results shows, RULA identified the high risk in performing job task in cellroom electrolyser. A survey method developed for the usefulness of ergonomic investigations in the workplace, in which occupational upper body muscle disease is identified. This tool does not require special equipment in providing posture measurements of the neck, back, arms and upper body as the function of the muscles and the external burden of the body. As a result, several design and tools were proposed to increase the operator's performance in cellroom electrolyser. © IEOM Society International.","Fatigue; Human error; Oil and gas plants; Petrochemical; Shift work",,,,,,"Kelly, C., (2005) The beauty of fit: Proportion and anthropometry in chair design, , Georgia Institute and Technology; Brian, M.K., (2005) Macroergonomics analysis and design of work systems.

This ability is expected to bring up a condition in which a person has full active awareness of the awakening of the entrepreneurial spirit within himself to then produce a productive person called Entrepreneurial Mindfulness. This study aims to develop self-detection tools about Entrepreneurial Mindfulness through an artificial intelligence-based website for students and alumni who are entrepreneurs.The research method used is the Neuroresearch method for developing Entrepreneurial Mindfulness measurement tools and the waterfall method for developing Artificial Intelligence-based websites. The results of research in the form of an Artificial Intelligence-based website about Entrepreneurial Mindfulness where the website will be able to provide profiling based on diagnoses made related to the level of Entrepreneurial Mindfulness owned by students and alumni in implementing entrepreneurial practices. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Websites; Measurement tools; research methods; Self detection; Self-diagnose; Waterfall methods; Artificial intelligence",,,,,,"Warwick, K, (2013) Artificial intelligence: the basics, , (Routledge); Russell, SJ, Norvig, P, (2010) Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 3. , (Prentice Hall); Liao, S-H, Expert system methodologies and applications-a decade review from 1995 to 2004 (2005) Expert Syst Appl, 28, pp. 93-103; Purda, L, Skillicorn, D, Accounting variables, deception, and a bag of words: Assessing the tools of fraud detection (2015) Contemp Account Res, 32, pp. 1193-1223; Audretsch, DB, Kuratko, DF, Link, AN, Making sense of the elusive paradigm of entrepreneurship (2015) Small Bus Econ, 45, pp. 703-712; Edward, L, Kerr, SP, Kerr, WR, Link, C, Glaeser, EL, Kerr, SP, (2015) Entrepreneurship and Urban Growth: An Empirical Assessment with Historical Mines The Harvard community has made this article openly available.

Quality professions will not be achieved if the teacher does not have a quality person andat the same time prosperous. By utilizing technological developments, the teacher can monitor and diagnose the condition of the self wellbeing on an ongoing basis, so as to optimize the quality of work life. Teacher's Quality Work Life is very important for teachers themselves as educators, institutions and the nation and state. Quality work life can be a measure of teacher growth vertically and horizontally along with the growth of the institution. The encounter of Education, psychologicaltrait with Artificial Intelligence is called Positive Education is the main objective of this research. One form is a self diagnostic that is able to diagnose psychological conditions to produce optimal quality.

The ASEAN Entrepreneurship Profiling website was developed to become a digital tool for entrepreneurs to carry out self-assessments and self-diagnostics related to their entrepreneurial profile. Before going to the further development stage, the instruments that will be the main pillars of website development need to be calibrated to produce valid and reliable instruments and coded on the website. The research used the survey method as part of the overall research method concept, namely the Neuroresearch method. This study uses the Neuroresearch method because this method has comprehensive stages in accordance with the research objectives.

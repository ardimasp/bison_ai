There are several methods exist to enhance the player's experiences in the games. One of the unexplored methods is a dynamic balancing system using Facial Expression Recognition. The player's facial expression is captured in real-time while the player is playing the game, and the dynamic balancing system will automatically adjust the game difficulty based on the player's facial expressions. This research aims to empirically explore the implementation of Facial Expression Recognition for a dynamic balancing system to enhance the player's experiences in the game. Two action games (2D and 3D) were developed and evaluated with 60 respondents in two groups. Both groups played the game twice, one with facial expression recognition system as dynamic balancing activated and one without. The results demonstrate that they are statistically significant differences (i.e. improvement) between the baseline and enhanced games with p < 0.01. © 2019 The Authors.

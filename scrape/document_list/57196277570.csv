The research on developing a Chinese grammar checking website is aimed at helping Mandarin learners in mastering Mandarin grammar. This website can be a ""learning companion"" of basic-level Mandarin learners outside the classroom. This technology is still very new, so this research should be carried out immediately by researchers in Indonesia to master this technology. The method used in this research is a quantitative approach. The collection of grammar patterns that will appear on the chineseteak.net will be selected from several Chinese textbooks. Then the pattern will become Mandarin grammar patterns and will be entered the website auto-correct grammar. This website is designed using PHP and MySQL as the database. From the results of the questionnaire, we can find out that there are 7 points of Mandarin grammar that are still difficult for early learners. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Natural language processing systems; Websites; Grammar checkers; Indonesia; Learning companions; NAtural language processing; Quantitative approach; Engineering education",,,,"Binus University: 033/VR, BNS2019-184, RTT/IV/2019","This research is a part of BINUS University research grant (Proposal Number: BNS2019-184; Contract Number: 033/VR.RTT/IV/2019), which got financial support from research transfer and technology office, Jakarta.

It caused by potential of China's economic growth in the world. Chinese language has introduced to children in early age in Indonesia. But sometimes learn Chinese language was difficult to them, which will make them feel boring. This paper has purpose to help children learn Chinese language using gamification and mnemonic method into game content. Briefly, gamification is process that adopt game elements to apply into non-game context and mnemonic is strategy to increase memory with various ways. Both in gamification and mnemonic method have applied in previous paper which the conclusion showed positive result in learning environment. This game refers to primary school, which students in 6-12 years old. The conclusion in this paper show that the developed game by authors can interest children to learn Chinese language based by pre-test and post-test result. © 2017 The Authors.

These programs are expected to have a positive outcome which is a better and increased teachers' competence. On the other hand, teacher's well-being might be disturbed by a negative impact from the program. This research aims to seek the subjective wellbeing of teachers in Jakarta and how to help teachers reach its wellbeing. The method use Neuroresearch (mix method), a mixture of qualitative research to build a theoretical construct and also observation as well as in-depth interviews with various parties and quantitative method by using measurement instruments subjective well-being Likert scale. The results found that (1) elementary teachers tend heading to wellbeing significantly at á <0.05 and (2) the cognitive dimension of teachers is an absolute determinant in shaping the well-being of primary school teachers. When a teachers cognitive is improved, then the wellbeing of primary school teachers will be increased by 20.983 from the current conditions. The study also found that the cognitive dimension is determined by the role of family situations and affective quality of teachers capable of acting 13.150 alters cognitive quality teachers. Recommendation from the results of this research is the need for new policies to change the model of teacher competency test that can empower cognitive competencies and simultaneously improve the conditions of teacher's family as the foundation of its economy. © Serials Publications.","Neuroresearch; Subjective well-being",,,,,,,"Ásgeir Jóhannesson, I., Different children - A tougher job (2006) Icelandic Teachers Reflect On Changes in Their Work.

In this paper we assess and analyze the implementation and support process using ITIL v3 - COBIT 5 Mapping. With objective to create practical guidance for measuring maturity of the process, assess capability level of the process, and make recommendation that can be applied to company's business process. As the result of assessment, we conclude that mean capability level of implementation and support process is 0.71. This indicates that majority of the process do not achieve level 1 capability level and failed to achieve its objective or fail to deliver any process evidence. As for recommendation we propose two short term solution, fulfill uncompleted base practice and focusing in development of Information Management System. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Condensed matter physics; Engineering; Industrial engineering; Materials science; Business Process; Information management systems; ITIL V3; Level-1; Market environment; Practical guidance; Process maturity; Short-term solutions; Information management",,,,,"Collyer, S., Project management approaches for dynamic environments (2009) International Journal of Project Management, 27 (4), pp. 355-364. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijproman.2008.04.004; Khan, M.W.J., Khalique, M., Strategic Planning and Reality of External Environment of Organizations in Contemporary Business Environments (2014) Business Management and Strategy, 5 (2), p. 165. , http://doi.org/10.5296/bms.v5i2.6794; Karkoskova, S., Feuerlicht, G., Extending MBI Model using ITIL and COBIT Processes (2015) Journal of Systems Integration, 5, pp. 29-44. , http://doi.org/10.20470/jsi.v6i4.244; Latif, A.A., Hanifi, N., Analyzing IT Function Using COBIT 4.1 - A Case Study of Malaysian Private University (2013) Journal of Economics, Business and Management, 1, pp. 406-408. , http://doi.org/10.7763/JOEBM.2013.V1.87; Isaca, (2013) COBIT: A Business Framework for the Governance and Management of Enterprise IT; Menevse, B.A., Case, S., (2012) Toward Better IT Governance with COBIT, 5, p. 2. , 4(October 2011); Karkoskova, S., Feuerlicht, G., Extending MBI Model using ITIL and COBIT Processes (2015) Journal of Systems Integration, 5, pp. 29-44. , http://doi.org/10.20470/jsi.v6i4.244; Mourad, M.B., Al, Hussain, M., The Impact of Cloud Computing on ITIL Service Strategy Processes (2014) International Journal of Computer and Communication Engineering, 3 (5), pp. 367-371. , http://doi.org/10.7763/IJCCE.2014.V3.35; Fajar, A.N., Budiardjo, E.K., Hasibuan, Z.A., System Architecture in Dynamic Environment based on Commonality and Variability Business Processes (2012) 8th ICCM Seoul, , (Seoul: IEEE); Fajar, A.N., Shofi, I.M., Reduced software complexity for E-Government applications with ZEF framework Telkomnika (Telecommunication Computing Electronics and Control), 15, pp. 415-420",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","2nd Nommensen International Conference on Technology and Engineering, NICTE 2018","19 July 2018 through 20 July 2018",,140093,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

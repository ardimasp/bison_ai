However, the navigation is still limited to open street and cannot be used in certain closed area such as in a sport club, playground or parks. In this research we develop an application based on Android which can determine the aproximate position of the user within a certain closed area. The area covered of this research is outdoor around 10000 m2. The research was done inside ABC sport building of Gelora Bung Karno - Jakarta. The result shows that the application is working with error estimation in 4 meters range. © 2014 IIJ.","Android; Closed area; GPS; Limited area; Smart phone",,,,,,"Miskelly, F., Electronic Tracking of Patients with Dementia and Wandering Using Mobile Phone Technology (2005) Age and Ageing, 34 (5), pp. 497-518; Nicholson, R.J., Brown, T.G., Caracciolo, A., Scribner Jr., J.R., Tracking System (1991), Software US 5014206 A, May 7; Elgethun, K., Yost, M.G., Fitzpatrick, C.T.E., Nyerges, T.L., Fenske, R.A., Comparison of Global Positioning System (GPS) Tracking and Parent-Report Diaries to Characterize Children's Time-Location Patterns (2006) Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology, 17, pp. 196-206. , June; Van der Spek, S., Van Schaick, S., De Bois, P., De Haan, R., Sensing Human Activity: GPS Tracking (2009) Sensors, 9 (4), pp. 3033-3055. , April; Zhang, D., Xia, F., Yang, Z., Yao, L., Zhao, W., Localization Techonolgy for Indoor Human Tracking (2010) 5th International Conference on Future Information Technology (Future Tech), pp. 1-6. , Busan; Werb, J., Lanzl, C., Designing a Positioning System for Finding Things and People Indoors (1998) IEEE Spectrum, 35 (9), pp. 71-78. , September; Yanying, Gu, Lo, A., Niemegeers, I., A Survey of Indoor Positioning Systems for Wireless Personal Networks (2009) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 11 (1), pp. 13-32. , March; Ran, L., Helal, S., Moore, S., Drishti: An Integrated Indoor/Outdoor Blind Navigation System and Service (2004) The Second IEEE Annual Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications, pp. 23-30; Zaruba, G.V., Huber, M., Kamangar, F.A., Chlamtac, I., Indoor Location Tracking Using RSSI Readings from a Single Wi-Fi Access Point (2007) Journal Wireless Networks, 13 (2), pp. 221-235. , April; Renaudin, V., Yalak, O., Tomé, P., Merminod, B., Indoor Navigation of Emergency Agents (2007) European Journal of Navigation, 5 (3), pp. 1-10. , July; Jin, G.-Y., Lu, X.-Y., Park, M.-S., An Indoor Localization Mechanism Using Active RFID Tag (2006) IEEE International Conference on Sensor Networks, Ubiquitous, and Trustworthy Computing, , Taichung; Khan, A., Mishra, R., GPS-GSM based tracking system (2012) International Journal of Engineering Trends and Technology, 3 (2), pp. 161-164; Amutha, B., Ponnavaikko, M., Location Update Accuracy in Human Tracking system using Zigbee modules (2009) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, 6 (2), pp. 322-331. , November","Gerdisen, Y.; Computer Engineering Department, Bina Nusantara UniversityIndonesia",,,"Internetworking Indonesia",,,,,19429703,,,,"English","Internetworking Indones.

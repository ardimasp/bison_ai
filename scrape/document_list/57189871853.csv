Cashless payment system is an emerging market in Indonesia. There are many of users and merchants that have been adopting cashless payment system replacing the conventional transactions. Micro-merchant is one of the stakeholders of mobile payment ecosystem which specifically receiving the low-value payment transaction from the mobile payment users. To measure micro-merchant’s readiness in continuing their usage on cashless payment system, we used the Technology Readiness Index (TRI) 2.0 approach. Parasuraman and Colby (2014) developed TRI 2.0 as a research scale in measuring and classifying individuals by their propensity to adopt technology. This research will provide the highlights of current situation of micro-merchant’s technology readiness and their continuance intention to adopt cashless payment system based on TR constructs. There are four constructs which are Optimism, Innovativeness, Discomfort and Insecurity that will be tested to find their relationship to the continuance intention in adopting cashless payment system. This research found that optimism is a determinant factor driving the micro-merchants’ continuance intention to adopt cashless payment system while discomfort is becoming main inhibitor. © 2020 IJSTR.","Cashless payment system; Micro-merchant; Mobile payment; Technology readiness; TRI",,,,,,"Ariani, A., Napitupulu, D., Jati, R., Kadar, J., Syafrullah, M., Testing of Technology Readiness Index Model Based on Exploratory Factor Analysis Approach (2018) Journal of Physics: Conference Series; Aron, J., Mobile Money and the Economy: A Review of the Evidence (2018) The World Bank Research Observer, 33 (2), pp. 135-188; Arvidsson, N., Consumer attitudes on mobile payment services-results from a proof of concept test (2014) International Journal of Bank Marketing, 32 (2), pp. 150-170; Au, Y.A., Kauffman, R.J., The economics of mobile payments: Understanding stakeholder issues for an emerging financial technology application (2008) Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 7 (2), pp. 141-164; Celik, H., Kocaman, R., Roles of Self-Monitoring, Fashion Involvement and Technology Readiness in an Individual's Propensity to Use Mobile Shopping (2017) Journal of System and Information Technology; Dahlberg, T., Guo, J., Ondrus, J., A critical review of mobile-payment research (2015) Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 14 (5), pp. 265-284; Eka, R., (2018) Trend of the Development of ""Mobile Payment"" in Indonesia., , https://dailysocial.id/post/perkembangan-mobile-payment-indonesia, March 6, Retrieved January 14, 2019, from dailysocial.id; Gombachika, H.S., Khangamwa, G., (2013) ICT Readiness and Acceptance among TEVT Students in University of Malawi, 30 (1), pp. 35-43; Guo, J., Bouwman, H., An analytical framework for an m-payment ecosystem: A merchants' perspective (2015) Telecommunications Policy, 40 (2-3), pp. 147-167; Hair, J.F., Jr., Black, W.C., Babin, B.J., Anderson, R.E., (2014) Multivariate Data Analysis, , 7 ed.).

However, surprisingly, there is no existing similarity function learning method proposed to maximize the top precision measure. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose the problem of maximum top precision similarity learning, and the first solution to this problem. The similarity is a linear function of the conjunction of features of a query image and a database image. To learn the similarity function parameter matrix, we propose to maximize the top precision measures of the training queries and also minimize the squared ℓ2 norm of the parameter matrix. The optimization problem is translated to a quadratic programming problem with regard to the Lagrange multipliers of top irrelevant images. The proposed algorithm, named as support top irrelevant machine, is evaluated over four benchmark image databases and is advantage over other similarity learning methods measured by top precision is shown. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Content-based image retrieval; Hinge loss; Similarity learning; Support top irrelevant machine; Top precision measure","Content based retrieval; Lagrange multipliers; Learning systems; Matrix algebra; Optimization; Quadratic programming; Query processing; Search engines; Content based image retrieval; Content based image retrieval systems; Learning similarity; Optimization problems; Quadratic programming problems; Similarity functions; Similarity learning; Top precision measure; Image retrieval",,,,,"Agarwal, S., (2011) The infinite push: a new support vector ranking algorithm that directly optimizes accuracy at the absolute top of the list.

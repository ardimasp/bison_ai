Travelers create the itinerary before they are travelling to an area. However, creating itinerary is not easy, many factors need to be considered before deciding where to go, such as the “must visited” places in that area, distance between tourist attractions to be visited within a day, preferred tourist attractions, and other information about the places. Generating the optimized distance itinerary is similar as a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The purpose of this research is to study the combination of simulated annealing and Greedy algorithms to create an itinerary. The initialization process of the simulated annealing algorithm uses Greedy algorithm searching technique and then proceeded with existing optimization step in simulated annealing method. This paper proposed a method of enhanced simulated annealing algorithm and the experiment results show the enhanced simulated annealing increase the effectiveness of simulated annealing algorithm which produce the shortest distance needed to travel places around an area. © 2019 The Authors.

Due to the large amount of transactions and various related constraints have to be taken into account in timetable scheduling process, resource manager team shall need a lot of time to the solve the problem. This research is aimed to discuss the application of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) that can be used to automatically generate optimal lecturer timetable scheduling. Using Software Laboratory Center (SLC) data, some hard constraints are taken into account such as the assistant should teach according to their qualifications, teaching in their work shift and doesn't teach any course that are being taken. Some soft constraints are also considered and the associated cost function is built based on these hard and soft constraints. Based on the computational results, the amount of penalty obtained by the PSO is much smaller than the GA on 500th iteration. The calculation is performed by comparing the amount of penalty that earned each time a hard constraint or soft constraint is violated by the implementation of PSO or GA to the total penalty obtained when all constraints are violated. © 2014 Science Publications.","Hard constraints; Particle swarm optimization; Soft constraints; Timetable scheduling",,,,,,"Al-Betar, M.A., Khader, A.T., A hybrid harmony search for university course timetabling (2009) Proceedings of the Multidisciplinary International Conference on Scheduling, pp. 157-179. , Theory and Applications Aug. 10-12, Dublin, Ireland; Bhaduri, A., University time table scheduling using genetic artificial immune network (2009) Proceedings of the International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing, pp. 289-292. , Oct. 27-28, IEEE Xplore Press, Kottayam, Kerala, DOI: 10.1109/ARTCom.2009.117; Chu, S., Chen, Y.T., Ho, J.H., Timetable scheduling using particle swarm optimization (2006) First International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control, pp. 324-327. , Aug. 30-Sept.1 DOI: 10.1109/ICICIC.2006.541; Colorni, A., Dorigo, M., Maniezzo, V., Genetic algorithms and highly constrained problems: The time-table case.

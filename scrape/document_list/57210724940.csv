Initially, we build this application only to help Small and Medium Enterprise owner to monitor their business and report. Yet, we realize that we can make our chatbot to be more effective and efficient using machine learning technique. N-gram and machine learning using schema matching are embedded to the chatbot to understand user intention and correct typographical error inside the sentences. Finally, the chatbot has been successfully achieved those objectives. It can be concluded that the chatbot can drive the users' feeling to be more convenient and help Small and Medium Enterprise owner to monitor their business. © 2008-2019.

SCRUM is one of example agile contain iteration called sprint which describes phasing running on the timeline of the project and by sprint planning the SCRUM master (as a leader) can direct the team to finish on a date. The motivation for SCRUM team member will influence the result, so in this research, we try to design a gamified method into SCRUM. We make a prototype design about gamification in SCRUM development and also spread a questionnaire to the respondent already have experience with SCRUM development. The result shows that people motivation will increase when they feel appreciated, rewarded and the atmosphere of the competition was made well supporting the team's performance. © 2018 IEEE.","agile; gamification; motivation; prototype; SCRUM; software development","Citrus fruits; Design; Iterative methods; Motivation; Software design; Software engineering; agile; Agile approaches; Gamification; prototype; Prototype designs; SCRUM; Software development methods; Software development projects; Software prototyping",,,,,"Cooper, L., (2015) Universal Agile Thinking-Supporting the Organization, , https://www.slideshare.net/cooperlk/universal-agile-thinking, Accessed: 29-Jul-2018; Korkishko, I., (2017) Top 6 Software Development Methodologies, , https://dev.to/iriskatastic/top-6-software-development-methodologies-9b, Accessed: 29-Jul-2018; (2015) Agile Methodologies for Software Development, , https://www.versionone.com/agile-101/agile-methodologies/, VersiOne.

This research uses several methods such as the method of analysis that includes literature study, design method and testing method. Then we design and test on how accurate the given data when compared to the real condition. The results achieved from the Drowsiness Detection System application design based on Computer Vision are the parameters which affect the performance of application such as distance and direction of camera to the eyes, and the ability to detect drowsiness around 90%. The conclusion obtained in this research is that application supports the theory that the average duration of eye closure which above 400 ms were classified into sleepy, while below 400ms, driver declared in normal state. With the ability to detect drowsiness of the drivers, this application can reduce the rate of traffic accidents every year, by giving the increasing awareness of the driver against driver's fatigue. © 2013 Academy Publisher.","Android; Computer vision; Driver's fatigue; Drowsiness detection system","Android; Design and analysis; Design and tests; Drowsiness detection; Fatigue estimation; Literature studies; Method of analysis; Testing method; Computer vision; Research; Robots; Testing; Design",,,,,"Padilla, R., Evaluation of Haar Cascade Classifiers Designed for Face Detection Journal of WASET, 64, pp. 362-365; Bradski, G., Kaebler, A., (2008) Learning OpenCV, p. 16. , O'Reilly, USA.

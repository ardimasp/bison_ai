At this time, Apartment design is a public space as a place for residents to socialize already lost, it was caused by the design itself. Even though an open space can be interacting and having ecological functions for the surrounding environment. The application of biophilic design in apartment is felt to be very necessary because it is able to help humans by providing a sense of comfort, calm and healing effect on a dwelling is needed. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","apartment; biophilic; Livable human settlements","apartment; Artificial environments; biophilic; Ecological functions; Human health; Human settlements; Public space; Surrounding environment; Apartment houses",,,,,"Aprilia, D.P., Sri, Y., Kusumaningdyah, N.H., APARTEMEN DENGAN PENDEKATAN DESAIN BIOPHILIK di JAKARTA SELATAN (2016) Arsitektur, 14; Arya, S.D.C., (2017) Pusat Kepedulian Dan Pelayanan HIV/Aids Dengan Pendekatan Biofilik di Jakarta Timur 8th Semester Students of Architecture in Binus University; Dan John Sons, W., (1976) Housing; Kellert, S., Calabrese, F., (2015) The PracTice Od Biophilic Design; Bright Green, T., (2015) 14 Patterns of Biophilic Oleh, Biophilic Design","Ardiani, Y.M.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: millaardiani@binus.ac.id",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Previous studies have identified variables that predict impulse buying, but not many of them have examined the human's self. This study aimed at investigating the roles of insecure self-engulfed self and perceived aesthetic of online shop in predicting the online impulse buying. The participants were 285 private sector employees (156 males and 129 females; Mean of the age of 27.1 years old; Standard deviation of the age of 5.9 years) in the Greater Jakarta, Indonesia. Data analysis using multiple linear regression analysis showed that empirical data supported the positive prediction hypotheses. An additional descriptive analysis applying the Terror Management Theory showed that participants with higher mortality salience tend to have more online buying experience, and they are inclined to purchase more luxurious items such as jewelry and expensive watch than participants with lower mortality salience. This study contributes to developing the interdisciplinary field of psychological science and information technology by integrating the self and the virtual medium of shopping variables as well as by recommending behavioral engineering to control online impulse buying. © International Journal on Advanced Science Engineering Information Technology.","Aesthetic; Business psychology; Impulsive buying; Mortality salience; Online; Self",,,,,,"Lu, Z., Wang, S., Li, X., Yang, L., Yang, D., Wu, D., ""Online shop location optimization using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision model-Case study on Taobao.com,"" (2012) Knowl-Based Syst, 32, pp. 76-83; ""Meningkatnya pertumbuhan belanja online di pasar negara berkembang-portal lengkap dunia marketing,"" (2012) Portal Lengkap Dunia Marketing, , http://www.marketing.co.id/meningkatnya-pertumbuhan-belanjaonline-di-pasar-negara-berkembang/, [Accessed: 14-Dec-2016]; Marketing, D.I., (2016) ""E-commerce usage in Indonesia 2016,"", , http://www.dionlinesurvey.com/en/2016/09/23/e-commerce-usage-in-indonesia-2016/, DI Marketing Online.

There are three social intervention solutions conducted during October 2014 to January 2015 in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, as part of Social Psychology and Psychological Intervention Course Program that will be discussed in detail, namely 1) intervention toward the observer’s (bystander’s) attitude toward the violence to be a preventer of the violence (or, to be an upstander), 2) intervention eliminating women objectification among men, and 3) intervention reducing verbal violent behavior against women. All those three will be discussed in an intervention methods of PATH, a model constructed by Abraham P. Buunk and Mark Van Vugt (2013) consisting of four stages, i.e. Problem formulation (Problem), Analysis and explanation (Analyze), Test stages (Test) and Intervention implementation (Help). The intervention targets are the students, the late teens, and the young adults through 1) Handbook of Violence Prevention to offer support and assistance for the actual and potential victims of domestic violence, 2) the campaign via radio mass media for prevention of women objectification, as well as 3) the delivery of contemplative messages through shirt and pin for verbal abuse prevention. © 2015, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

Originally, kombucha made from a combination of sweetened tea that mixed with a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast to ferment. Moreover, the making of kombucha starts to vary through an infusion method such as herbs infusion, flowers or fruits, and vegetable mixture, and even to substitute with the coffee ground. Indonesia is the fifth largest consumer of coffee in the world. Therefore, this article aims to study an upcycling of leftover coffee grounds to produce kombucha. This form of fermentation method with inoculum Kombucha tea, which then known as Kombucha coffee (KC). The empiric study was conducted using a quantitative method, where a secondary data was supported with the primary result of questionnaires to eighty panelists. The findings of this research suggested that the aroma and taste of KC widely accept by the respondents. Additionally, KC's aroma, taste, and texture proved more hedonic value than tea kombucha. Although the study has a limitation such as time and the number of respondents. But, the result of the study stimulates a further discussion to investigate the significance of KC towards business and economic benefits. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Saxe, L., (2019) Fermented foods are up 149%-as long as they're unfamiliar"", , Https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizzysaxe/2019/02/06/fermented-foods-are-up-149-percent-as-long-as-theyre-unfamiliar, Forbes.com, February 6, [Online].

Dark tourism, as the niche of tourism offers an economic value for tourists' consumption that forged between reality and imagination. However, few studies were found to understand the realm of development of dark tourism varieties and attractions, which associated with death and suffering from lower political and ideology to the highest range while consuming it. Therefore, alongside the analytical thinking towards the product's typology and variety, the examination of both SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunity, Threats) model and TOWS (Threat-Opportunity & Weakness-Strength) matrix, synchronize the sites' elaboration resources and capabilities in which the dark tourism's place and space operate. Both of the qualitative case studies of Fatahillah Dungeon and Taman Prasasti museum provide the research practice that emerges from the visitors' voices. The findings deliver undiscovered value for the product development initiative, where at the same time bids the model for the dark tourism's consumption in term of the value creation and experience that giving the sites' meaning in recognizing how 'dark' the product is and stand out from the mass. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Museums; Tourism; Analytical thinking; Economic values; Qualitative case studies; Resources and capabilities; Value creation; Leisure industry",,,,,"(2017) Travel & Tourism: Economic Impact 2017 - World, , WTTC; (2016) Global Travel & Tourism Economic Impact Update August 2016, , WTTC; Komsary, K.C., Commemorative Tourism: Menuju Sebuah Tipologi Daya Tarik Wisata Yang Berhubungan Dengan Kematian dan Bencana (2016) Jurnal Hospitality Dan Pariwisata, 2; Hartmann, R., Dark tourism, thanatourism, and dissonance in heritage tourism management: New directions in contemporary tourism research (2014) Journal of Heritage Tourism, 9 (2), pp. 166-182; Sharpley, R., Stone, P.R., (2009) The Darker Side of Travel: The Theory and Practice of Dark Tourism, 41; Tarlow, P.E., Novelli, M., (2007) Niche Tourism: Contemporary Issues, Trends and Cases, p. 47; (2018) Auswitch-Birkenau Attendance, , http://auschwitz.org/en/visiting/attendance/, [cited 2018 23 April 2018]; Blair, J., (2002) The New York Times; (2018) Tripadvisor.

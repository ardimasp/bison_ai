The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model (UTAUT) was used as the basis for the research framework. The variables involved in this study are attitude, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, hands-on training, course structure, perceived instructor knowledge, and self-reported knowledge. The research questionnaires were adopted from previous studies. SmartPLS was used to test the measurement and structural models using a convenience sample of 102 students. The results showed that all variables are significant towards student's perceived learning outcomes and satisfaction except for effort expectancy, hands-on training, and perceived instructor knowledge. The result of this study can become a suggestion to the institutions to evaluate the aspects that influence the student's satisfaction and learning outcomes. © 2019 IEEE.","Attitude; Course structure; Effort expectancy; Hands-on training; Perceived instructor knowledge; Performance expectancy; Self-reported knowledge","Information systems; Information use; Personnel training; Surveys; Hands-on-trainings; Perceived learning outcomes; Research frameworks; Research questionnaires; Structural models; Student satisfaction; Student's satisfaction; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; Students",,,,,"Sayana, S.A., Using caats to support is audit (2003) Information Systems Control Journal, 1; Braun, R.L., Davis, H.E., Computer-assisted audit tools and techniques: Analysis and perspectives (2003) Managerial Auditing Journal, 18 (9), pp. 725-731; Pedrosa, I., Costa, C.J., Computer assisted audit tools and techniques in real world: Caatt's applications and approaches in context (2012) International Journal of Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management Applications, 4, pp. 161-168; Popa, M., Toma, C., Amancei, C., Characteristic of the audit processes for distributed informatics systems (2009) Informatica Economica, 13; Debreceny, R., Lee, S.L., Neo, W., Toh, J.S., Employing generalized audit software in the financial services sector (2005) Managerial Auditing Journal, 20, pp. 605-618; (2019) ACL Official Website, , https://www.acl.com; Widuri, R., O'Connell, B., Yapa, P.W., Adopting generalized audit software: An Indonesian perspective (2016) Managerial Auditing Journal, 31 (8-9), pp. 821-847; Hussey, T., Patrick, S., Learning outcomes: A conceptual analysis (2008) Teaching in Higher Education, 13, pp. 107-115. , Februar; Trigwell, K., Prosser, M., (1991) Improving the Quality of Student Learning: The Influence of Learning Context and Student Approach to Learning on Learning Outcomes, pp. 251-266; Venkatesh, V., Morris, M.G., Davis, G.B., Davis, F.D., (2003) User Acceptance of Information Technology: Toward A Unified View, pp. 425-478; Nustini, Y., Prabawa, D.W., Faktor yang Mempengaruhi Hasil Pembelajaran Mata Kuliah Enterprise Resource Planing (2017) Simposium Nasional Akuntansi XX; Alshare, K.A., Lane, P.L., Predicting student-perceived learning outcomes and satisfaction in erp courses: An empirical investigation (2011) Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 28; Eom, S.B., Wen, H.J., The determinants of students' perceived learning outcomes and satisfaction in university online education: An empirical investigation (2006) Decision Sciences Journal of Innovative Education, pp. 215-234. , Jul; Pridmore, J., Deng, J., Turner, D., Prince, B., Enhancing Student Learning of ERP and Business Process Knowledge through Hands-On ERP Exercises in an Introductory Management of Information Systems Course (2014) SAIS 2014 Proceedings; (2019) SmartPLS Official Website, , https://www.smartpls.com/documentation/algorithmsand-techniques/discriminant-validity-assessment; Sander, T., Lee, T.P., Smartpls for the human resources field to evaluate a model (2014) New Challenges of Economic and Business Development, pp. 346-358. , 8-10 May",,,,"IEEE Computer Society","6th International Conference on Research and Innovation in Information Systems: Empowering Digital Innovation, ICRIIS 2019","2 December 2019 through 3 December 2019",,159491,23248149,9781728167268,,,"English","Int.

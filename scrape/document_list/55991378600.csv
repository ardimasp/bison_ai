A technology, so called Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), has long been developed to address this issue. The traffic congestion is addressed by ITS using a set of information and telecommunication technology. This technology strongly depends on traffic sensors to record the traffic data such as the traffic flow, the traffic speed, and the traffic density. In this research, we develop a traffic sensor technology using a simple camera to record the traffic data. The video recorded by a camera is then analyzed using computer vision techniques to recognize the types of the objects. In this application, occlusion is major cause of information loss. The research intends to implement the object feature point technique to handle occlusion in the traffic data recorded using a low cost camera. These feature points of objects can overcome the occlusion problem because the approach uses intrinsic feature points such as movement and distance between the feature points; therefore, in a mixed and dense traffic, one can still record the traffic data from various vehicles. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Clustering; Feature points analysis; Intelligent transportation system; Object tracking; Traffic surveillance",,,,,,"Winarno, H., (2011), http://oto.detik.com/read/2011/02/10/172849/1568834/648/ rp-107-triliun-bbm-yang-dihambur-hamburkan-ketika-macet, February 11, Dipetik February 3, 2012, dari Detik Oto; Lien, C.C., (2007) Targets Tracking in the Crowd, , Departement of Computer Science and Information Engineering.

I, Indonesia","Any application toward the usage of technology will refer to the technology acceptance model (TAM) theory. However, there is one thing that becomes a major concern for small traders. It is the attitude toward risk. This study wants to evaluate this variable related to the development of Micro and Small Businesses (MSME) with ICT Adoption. This research will want to see the effect of attitudes on business risk on usage behaviour, on their innovation capacity. The quantitative research method is used to analyse the interview result of traditional small business owners who have limited capital, have a low income and run their businesses. The results of this paper show that there is a new perspective on technology acceptance models. Based on this paper, the attitude in taking risks to using technology in developing business has a significant influence on small businesses. © 2019, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Application; Attitude; Business; Risk; SME; TAM; Technology",,,,,,"Alam, S., Noor, M.K., ICT Adoption in Small and Medium Enterprises: An Empirical Evidence of Service Sectors in Malaysia (2009) International Journal of Business and Management, 4 (2), p. 118. , February, 2009; Andersen, J., Strategic resources and firm performance (2011) Management Decision, 49 (1), pp. 87-98. , https://doi.org/10.1108/00251741111094455; Barney, J., Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17. , 1991.

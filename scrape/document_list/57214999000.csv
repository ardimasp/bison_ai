Finance the guarantee data is extremely important because this data is checked you will be State-run finance is already good or less good, already underway in accordance with standard operational procedures. Show case of branches; see the status of data has been done by each branch, the amount of any status on a branch that has performed guarantee. The data of the vehicle that has been issued by a fiduciary as well as consumers who have made the assurance to the fiduciary. The methods used in this paper are to follow nine step. The objectives to be achieved from this paper so that the resulting data can answer the question of fiduciary business process, by generating the dashboard as a faster visualization on understanding and a report. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Ren, S., Shen, F., Xu, H., Li, M., Wu, J., (2018) International Symposium on Resource Exploration and Environmental Science, pp. 1-5. , https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/170/2/022080/pdf; Wu, P., Zhou, Q., Wei, Q., Lei, Z., Li, X., (2018) AIAAT, pp. 1-8. , https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/435/1/012033/pdf; Winarno, J., (2017) Jurnal Independent Fakultas Hukum, pp. 44-54. , http://journal.unisla.ac.id/pdf/15112013/5.pdf; Wu, P., Zhou, Q., Wei, Q., Lei, Z., Li, X., (2018) AIAAT 2018, pp. 1-8. , https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/435/1/012033/pdf; Purwati, E., Gunawan, S., (2018) Jurnal Sistem Informasi Dan Manajemen Basis Data (SIMADA), 1, pp. 81-92. , https://jurnal.darmajaya.ac.id/index.php/SIMADA/article/viewFile/1142/746; Alviana, S., Kurniawan, B., (2018) INCITEST, pp. 1-7. , https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/407/1/012092/pdf; Girsang, A.S., Isa, S.M., Adytiansya, N., Utomo, O.K., Simarmata, J., (2018) 2nd Nommensen International Conference on Technology and Engineering, pp. 1-7. , https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/420/1/012104/pdf",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd Nommensen International Conference on Technology and Engineering 2019, NICTE 2019","25 July 2019 through 26 July 2019",,157456,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

IoT can be applied in various fields such as smart city, smart transportation, agriculture, weather monitoring and other fields. In this research, design and development of Cloud computing based Internet of Things for weather monitoring based on temperature, humidity and rainfall of surrounding environment parameters as message, and using MQTT which is IoT/M2M connectivity protocol. There are three main components of MQTT: the first component that generates the message is called a publisher, the second that consumes messages is called a subscriber, and the last component that handles the interaction between the publisher and the subscriber is called a broker or intermediary. Usability testing is also done from each component of the system using the black box approach that can represent overall functionality. Based on the design model of weather monitoring system, end-user can monitor weather conditions according to the placement node device of location and through Web-based applications installed on the cloud server. The amount of data message formatted into JSON is ± 120 bytes, and is published by node with time interval per ± 30 seconds. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Cloud; Internet of things; JSON; MQTT broker; Publish/subscribe",,,,,,"Bradley, D., Russell, D., Ferguson, I., Isaacs, J., Macleod, A., White, R., The Internet of Things – The future or the end of mechatronics (2015) ELSEVIER in Mechatronics, 27, pp. 57-74. , April; Agus Triawan, M., Hindersah, H., Internet of things using publish and subscribe method cloud-based application to NFT-based hydroponic system (2016) International Conference on System Engineering and Technology, pp. 98-104; Kumar, S., Goudar, R.H., Cloud Computing – Research Issues, Challenges, Architecture, Platforms and Applications: A Survey (2012) IEEE in International Journal of Future Computer and Communication, 1 (4), pp. 356-360; Ashton, K., That ‘Internet of Things’ Thing RFID Journal, , 22 June 2009; Kodali, R.K., Sahu, A., An IoT based weather information prototype using WeMos (2016) IEEE International Conference on Contemporary Computing and Informatics (IC3I), Noida, pp. 612-616; Muhammad, G., Rahman, S.M.M., Alelaiwi, A., Alamri, A., Smart Health Solution Integrating IoT and Cloud: A Case Study of Voice Pathology Monitoring (2017) IEEE in Communications Magazine, 55 (1), pp. 69-73. , January; Markus, A., Kertesz, A., Simulating IoT Cloud systems: A meteorological case study (2017) Second International Conference on Fog and Mobile Edge Computing (FMEC), 2017, pp. 171-176. , Valencia; Vandikas, K., Tsiatsis, V., Microservices in IoT clouds (2016) IEEE 2016 Cloudification of the Internet of Things (Ciot), pp. 1-6; Gnimpieba, Z.D.R., Nait-Sidi-Moh, A., Durand, D., Fortin, J., Using Internet of Things Technologies for a Collaborative Supply Chain: Application to Tracking of Pallets and Containers (2015) ELSEVIER in Procedia Computer Science, 56, pp. 550-557; Verdouw, C.N., Wolfert, J., Beulens, A.J.M., Rialland, A., Virtualization of food supply chains with the internet of things (2016) ELSEVIER in Journal of Food Engineering, 176, pp. 128-136; Verdouw, C.N., Wolfert, J., Beulens, A.J.M., Rialland, A., Frequently Asked Questions, , http://mqtt.org/faq, 01 November 2017; Kumar, S., Goudar, R.H., Cloud Computing – Research Issues, Challenges, Architecture, Platforms and Applications: A Survey (2012) International Journal of Future Computer and Communication, 1 (4), pp. 356-360; Kumar, S., Goudar, R.H., (2011) The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing, , SP 800-145; Kumar, S., Goudar, R.H., Introduction JSON, , https://www.json.org/index.html; Myers, G.J., Badgett, T., Sandler, C., Usability (User) Testing The Art of Software Testing; Bacso, M., Gutiérrez, O.L.G., Designing and executing a security and usability testing plan: IdeaClick Prototype (2013) HAAGA-HELIA University in Business Information Department Technology; Fajar, A.N., Budiardjo, E.K., Hasibuan, Z.A., System Architecture in Dynamic Environment based on Commonality and Variability Business Processes (2012) 8Th ICCM IEEE",,,,"Little Lion Scientific",,,,,19928645,,,,"English","J.

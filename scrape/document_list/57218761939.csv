To achieving production targets there are some that become problems. Production problems can be internal and external problems. This study discusses the problem of achieving production targets that are internal. Based on the information from the company, component availability is one of the problem of production targets for the machines. Therefore, a schedule is made for the supply of machine components so as to reduce engine breakdown time and make engine performance to the maximum by using Maintenance Management method. Other than that, performed the calculation of the cost for maintenance of the machine by using two methods to be selected based on the lowest cost. The result of the calculation shows the best method to generate the lowest cost is the Repair Maintenance Policy Method. The results that have been obtained are expected to be a consideration of the company for improvement in the future. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

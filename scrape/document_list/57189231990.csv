In this paper, the combination of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) methods for feature extraction was proposed. The attributes extracted from DCT method were mean and variance, while the attributes extracted from GLCM method were energy and entropy. Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) was used as a classifier. The classifier model was trained using 50% of the texture images and remaining images were used for testing. Four classes of texture images were downloaded from KTH-TIPS (Textures under varying Illumination, Pose and Scale) image database, three of which were used in each experiments thus there were four data combination. The best data testing accuracy result towards textures of crumpled aluminium foil, corduroy, and orange peel is 98.3%, which is 1.6% better than one hidden-layer feed forward neural network classifier. In average, testing accuracy result of ANFIS excelled one hidden-layer feed forward neural network with 93.7% over 90.4%. © 2015 IEEE.","Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System; Discrete Cosine Transform; Gray Level Co-Occurence Matrix; Texture Images","Discrete cosine transforms; Feature extraction; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Image texture; Matrix algebra; Mechanics; MEMS; Pattern recognition; Tracking (position); Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Classifier models; Data combination; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); Energy and entropies; Gray level co occurrence matrix(GLCM); Gray level co-occurence matrix; Texture image; Image classification",,,,,"Avci, D., Poyraz, M., Leblebicioglu, M., An expert system based on discrete wavelet transform-ANFIS for acquisition and recognition of invariant features from texture images (2015) Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU), 2015 23th, pp. 1070-1073. , May; Chandankhede, P.H., Soft computing based texture classification with matlab tool (2012) International Journal of Soft Computing and Engineering, (2), pp. 475-480; Ruiz, L.A., Fdez-Sarrá, A., Recio, J.A., Texture feature extraction for classification of remote sensing data using wavelet decomposition: A comparative study (2004) International Archives of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 35, pp. 1682-1750; Mohanaiah, P., Sathyanarayana, P., Gurukumar, L., Image texture feature extraction using glcm approach (2013) International Journal of Scientific & Research Publication, 3 (5), pp. 1-5; Wu, C.-H., Lee, J.-S., Shie, C.-Y., Su, M.-Y., Rock classification via a mobile device (2012) Communications and Networking in China (CHINACOM), 2012 7th International ICST Conference on, pp. 663-666. , Aug; Mario Fritz, B.C., Hayman, E., Eklundh, J.-O., (2004) The KTHTIPS and KTH-TIPS2 Image Databases, , http//www.nada.kth.se/cvap/databases/kth-tips/documentation.html; Sorwar, G., Abraham, A., DCT based texture classification using soft computing approach (2004) CoRR, , http//arxiv.org/abs/cs.AI/0405013, cs.AI/0405013; Zhen, W., Zhe, X., SIFT feature extraction algorithm for image in dct domain (2013) Proceedings of the 2nd ISCCCA-13, pp. 261-264; Costianes, P., Plock, J., Gray-level co-occurrence matrices as features in edge enhanced images (2010) Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop (AIPR), 2010 IEEE 39th, pp. 1-6. , Oct; Goswami, S., Bhaiya, L., A hybrid neuro-fuzzy approach for brain abnormality detection using glcm based feature extraction (2013) Emerging Trends in Communication, Control, Signal Processing Computing Applications (C2SPCA), 2013 International Conference on, pp. 1-7. , Oct",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","International Conference on Automation, Cognitive Science, Optics, Micro Electro-Mechanical System, and Information Technology, ICACOMIT 2015","29 October 2015 through 30 October 2015",,121121,,9781467374088,,,"English","Proc.

The significant growth of active Instagram users affects the size of Instagram data. The more number of users, the larger and more various Instagram data is posted. In line with its popularity, in recent years many researchers begin to study and analyze it for various purposes, such as detecting event photos based on location, clustering the photo content, advertising strategies based on user types, and so on. As of now there are three types of data available in Instagram which are text, image, and video. In this paper we propose Term-Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method to rank keywords of top twenty most followed Instagram users based on image captions of Instagram. The objective of this research is to automatically know the main idea of Instagram users based on 50 recent image captions posted. In our experiments, TF-IDF has been successfully implemented to reveal a set of keywords with its ranking. The highest ranking of keyword is indeed the main topic of a user, indicated by the value of TF-IDF. The result of study indicates that TF-IDF method is very useful to find and rank the keywords of Instagram users image captions. In the future research, the ranking keywords are needed in solving classification and clustering tasks as feature extractions. © 2015 IEEE.","Instagram; social media; Term-Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency; text mining","Data mining; Social networking (online); Text processing; Advertising strategy; Classification and clustering; Image caption; Instagram; Inverse Document Frequency; Social media; Term Frequency; Text mining; Inverse problems",,,,,"Golbeck, J., (2015) Introduction to Social Media Investigation: A Hands-On Approach, , 1st ed.

This study empirically examines such influences on taxpayers’ perceptions of tax compliance (either voluntary or enforced) in Indonesia after the implementation of a tax amnesty. In 2018, data were collected through a face-to-face questionnaire survey of 410 small business taxpayers and analyzed using a stepwise linear regression model. Trust in government was positively related to agreement with/support of voluntary tax compliance; however, perceptions of government’s power were only marginally significant. Neither trust in government nor perceptions of government’s power influenced taxpayers’ perceptions of enforced tax compliance. These findings partly support the Slippery Slope Framework. This study contributes to the literature on the influence of trust and power on voluntary or enforced tax compliance in developing countries, particularly Asia, after the implementation of a tax amnesty. © The Author(s) 2020.","enforced tax compliance; government’s power; Slippery Slope Framework; trust in the government; voluntary tax compliance",,,,,"Binus University: RT/III/2018, 014/VR","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Bina Nusantara University (Grant 014/VR.RT/III/2018).","Allingham, M.G., Sandmo, A., Income tax evasion: A theoretical analysis (1972) Journal of Public Economics, 1 (3-4), pp. 323-338. , https://doi.org/10.1016/0047-2727(72)90010-2; Alm, J., A perspective on the experimental analysis of taxpayer reporting (1991) The Accounting Review, 66 (3), pp. 577-593; Alm, J., What motives tax compliance?

Using multiple regressions, six tax compliance factors are examined. Data were collected through a survey conducted in Jakarta using 328 respondents who are small business taxpayers. A researcher–administered questionnaire survey method was used for data collection. The results reveal that referral groups, the probability of audit, tax knowledge, and the perception of equity and fairness have a significant impact on tax compliance. In particular, the referral group had the most significant influence on the noncompliance behavior of SME taxpayers. These findings can enable policymakers to develop future tax policies that focus on tax compliance.

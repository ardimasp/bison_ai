This study investigates how the use of ICT affects firms’ agility and finally ends in their competitive advantage. In other words, this study examines how firms’ ICT capabilities directly enhance their competitive advantage. Their ICT capability also affects the firms’ competitive agitlity indirectly by mediating their business agility. This study infers that if small business firms would like to enhance their supply chains and customer relationship management, they should adopt ICT as a tool to transform their businesses. This transformation improves small firms’ competitiveness levels because it allows them to manage all their customers. Meanwhile, the small business firms could enhance their agility due to their suppliers’ closeness. This means that the small business firms have posited the concepts and philosophy suggested by the resources dependent theory. © 2019, Gadjah Mada University.

The study is based on resources that cannot be directly converted into the competitive advantage of companies but must instead be subjected to an entrepreneurial process and offer new insights into the use of ICT as a valuable corporate resource. The paper is based on a quantitative approach using a population comprising apparel retailers from traditional markets in Jakarta, Indonesia. The sample was obtained using random sampling. The survey was conducted among 462 small businesses across five traditional apparel markets managed by PD. Pasar Jaya. The data were processed using Structural Equation Modeling?Partial Least Squares. The results show that ICT capability has no significant effect on competitive advantage, although it does have a significant effect on entrepreneurial orientation and organizational agility. Organizational agility and entrepreneurial orientation have a significant effect on competitive advantage, thus indicating that ICT capability in small businesses cannot be directly converted into a competitive advantage. The finding of the research is that ICT capability is able to create competitive advantage in small businesses but only when present in conjunction with entrepreneurial orientation and organizational agility. © IJTech 2019.","Apparel retail; Competitive advantage; Entrepreneurial orientation; ICT capability; Organizational agility",,,,,,"We gratefully acknowledge the support of the DKI Provincial Government through the PD.

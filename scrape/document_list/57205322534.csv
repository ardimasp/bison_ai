After decades of isolation as Myanmar slowly opens itself to the world, global businesses making their inroads into the country are poised with several challenges in addressing the agenda of people with disabilities (PWD) in the workplace in Myanmar. This article reports the preliminary study findings of a qualitative study of business professionals, as well as civil society members including PWD, based in the business capital city of Yangon, to examine the various business impediments in their engagement with disabled people in the workplace. The preliminary findings indicate three barriers for businesses in engaging with the issue of disabilities. These are restricted business understandings, a weak social model of disability, nascent management approaches, and an absence of skills and resources for PWD. The study indicates that in the absence of strong public policies and a regulatory environment, voluntary business participation through stakeholder engagement with the government and PWD is an essential way forward for businesses to facilitate disability mainstreaming in the workplace in Myanmar. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Business; Disability; Myanmar; People with disabilities; Workplace",,,,,,"Special thanks to the IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika Journal team, which have assisted to publish this article.","Choudhury-Kaul, S., (2015) Business, disability and corporate social responsibility: The India experience, , (Doctoral dissertation), Monash University, Australia; Coyne, I.

This paper aims to propose a multi-method interpretive framework, integrating a historiographical approach and an archival investigation, and use the case of business responses to disability in colonial and post-independence India to elucidate the proposed framework. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a summary of a proposed framework for the historical study of marginalized social issues using an interpretive paradigm. It also outlines the advantages and limitations of the proposed framework. Findings: This paper makes a methodological contribution in multi-method interpretive research design for the historical study of socially constructed issues, neglected because of deep prejudice and social exclusion, that offer complex challenges for modern businesses seeking inclusive workplace strategies. Originality/value: This paper proposes a research framework that contextualizes social issues in history (historiographical study) and cases of business responses to these issues (archival study) for the examination of historically marginalized issues in the business–society relationship. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","History; Interpretive research; Management research; Marginalized issues; Qualitative inquiry",,,,,,,"Adorisio, A.L.M., Mutch, A., In search of historical methods (2013) Management and Organizational History, 8 (2), pp. 105-110; Amatori, F., Jones, G., (2003) Business History Around the World, , (Eds) (, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Barbour, R.S., Barbour, M., Evaluating and synthesizing qualitative research: the need to develop a distinctive approach (2003) Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice, 9 (2), pp. 179-186; Bell, E., Taylor, S., Writing history into management research (2013) Management and Organizational History, 8 (2), pp. 127-136; Bird, F., Why the responsible practice of business ethics calls for a due regard for history (2009) Journal of Business Ethics, 89 (S2), pp. 203-220; Boell, S.K., Cecez-Kecmanovic, D., Literature reviews and the hermeneutic circle (2010) Australian Academic and Research Libraries, 41 (2), pp. 129-144; Booth, C., Rowlinson, M., Management and organizational history: Prospects (2006) Management and Organizational History, 1 (1), pp. 5-30; Bredberg, E., Writing disability history: problems, perspectives and sources (2010) Disability and Society, 14 (2), pp. 189-201; Bryman, A., (2004) Social Research Methods, , 2nd ed, Oxford University Press, Oxford; Bulhof, I.N., (1980) Wilhelm Dilthey: A Hermeneutic Approach to the Study of History and Culture, Hague, , Martinus Nijhoff, Leiden; Burrell, G., Morgan, G., (2005) Sociological Paradigms and Organizational Analysis: Elements of the Sociology of Corporate Life, , Ashgate, Farnham; Carroll, A.B., A history of corporate social responsibility: Concepts and practices (2008) The Oxford Handbook of Corporate Social Responsibility, pp. 19-46. , Crane, A., McWilliams, A., Matten, D., Moon, J. and Siegel, D.,(Eds), Oxford University Press, Oxford; Cohen, L., Manion, L., Morrison, K.R.B., (2007) Research Methods in Education, , 6th ed, Routledge, London; Cohen, M.Z., Kahn, D.L., Steeves, R., How to analyze data (2000) Hermeneutic Phenomenological Research: A Practical Guide for Nurse Researchers, pp. 71-92. , Cohen, M.Z., Kahn, D.L. and Steeves, R.H, and (Eds), Sage, Thousand Oaks, CA; Connaway, L.S., Powell, R.R., (2010) Basic Research Methods for Librarians, , 5th ed, ABC-CLIO, Santa Barbara, CA; Corti, L., Archival research (2004) Encyclopedia of Social Science Research Methods, 1, pp. 20-21. , Lewis-Beck, M.S., Bryman, A. and Liao, T.F (Eds), Sage, London; Crotty, M., (1998) The Foundations of Social Research: Meaning and Perspective in the Research Process, , Sage, London; Danto, E.A., (2008) Historical Research, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; de Jong, A., Higgins, D.M., van Driel, H., New business history?

With so much data that can be collected and analyzed, it is expected to create an early warning system if there are parameters that are already in the critical value and are at risk of causing crop failure. As information technology is developing rapidly, it could be utilized as a tool to support the effort in facing this issue. this study will focus on providing a reliable open data platform which is accessible to relevant stakeholders Google Cloud Platform is selected to serve this purpose to mitigate the risk of maintaining a reliable high availability platform. Google Cloud IoT Core is configured to accept MQTT protocol message sent by sensors. Other google cloud functionality will be configured to store the message into google NoSQL database. Google cloud function will be used to provide data if any request of data to server is being made through REST webservice call. As a result, all the configured Google functionalities are able to synchronize to store and retrieve data. © 2018 IEEE.","Big Data Application; Data Integration; Internet of Things; Mobile Applications; Web Services","Agriculture; Data integration; Internet of things; Soil moisture; Web services; Big data applications; Cloud platforms; Data collecting; Distributed sensor; Early Warning System; High availability; Mobile applications; Protocol message; Open Data",,,,,"Lopes Ramos, I.C., (2017) Why Focus on Data?Why GODAN?, pp. 2-3. , ictupdate; Verdouw Cor, N.S.W., Internet of things in agriculture (2016) Research Gate; Fengqi Hao, X.L., Research on key technologies of intelligent agriculture based on agricultural (2016) 2016 International Conference on Smart City and Systems Engineering, pp. 598-601. , IEEE; Prathibha, S.R., Hongal, A., Jyothi, M.P., Iot based monitoring system in smart agriculture (2017) 2017 International Conference on Recent Advances in Electronics and Communication Technology (ICRAECT), pp. 81-84. , Bangalore; (2015) Open Government Agriculture Nutrition GODAN and the Open Government Partnership, , http://www.godan.info/sites/default/files/old/2015/04/GODAN-OGP-2015-En.pdf, Anonymous; Furht, B., Cloud computing fundamentals (2010) Handbook of Cloud Computing, , In A.

The purpose of this research is to design an online warteg application. Application development uses the method of developing system development life cycle with the waterfall model. This application was built using the Native React Framework and with the PostgreSQL Database. The expected result is the design of online warteg applications that can be accessed on websites and mobile phones that can help warteg entrepreneurs to facilitate the promotion and sale of merchandise they sell, as well as to facilitate the public to buy food without having to come to the warteg. © 2020 IEEE.","Mobile application; Sdlc; Warung tegal; Waterfall; Website","Life cycle; Software engineering; Application development; Development model; On-line applications; PostgreSQL; System development life cycles; Waterfall model; Web apps; Information management",,,,,"The researcher would like to thank the Computer Science Department, BINUS Online Learning, Bina Nusantara University that has provided the researcher's direction for conducting this research.","Indonesia, P.I., (2018) Warteg, Fenomena Urbanisasi (Bagian 1), , https://indonesia.go.id/ragam/kuliner/kebudayaan/wartegfenomena-urbanisasi-bagian-1; Nalariza, A., Sugiarso, T., Perancangan dan implementasi 'kantin online' berbasis android (2016) J.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the risk of risk management information systems especially on financial technology which is based on the level of risk that is happening and also measure the level of maturity that has been applied whether it is in line with the expected target of one of the state-owned banks. this research uses ISO 31000 standard, observations, audit check lists, and interviews. In this risk management information system analysis will focus on 7 domains. The results of this study indicate that the level of risk faced by Bank XYZ is at the highest risk level. so that Bank XYZ must take control to overcome these risks. Information system maturity level at Bank XYZ has an average value of 3.00 which explains that it is still in the defined stage. While the target expected by Bank XYZ is 4.00. The gap of 1.00 must be a concern, because the level of risk arises due to the maturity level of the Bank XYZ system that has not been fulfilled. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS","Enterprise Risk Management; Financial Technology; Information System Risk Management; ISO 31000; Maturity Level",,,,,,"Bennis, W., Why leaders can’t lead (1989) Train.

The objective of the research is to establish the simplicity on apparel by using neodymium magnet as a closure. This closure can reduce the time consumption in wearing apparel which is suitable for urban lifestyle as well as to offer new and unique apparel closure. The methodology use for the research is using interview method with the target market, experts on the industry, and magnet expert. The researcher also produces the prototype of the apparel such as jacket, top and skirt to demonstrate the time efficiency on using magnetic clothes and to compare with common clothes using button and zipper as a closure. The research reveals that the using of magnetic closure is suitable for urban lifestyle as it answer the needs of time efficiency and also offers uniqueness to the apparel. The respondents show good response to this new closure and willing to buy the product if it offers and sells in the market. However, further research should be done to study the magnet treatment on apparel, a series of proper test should be made if the magnetic apparel will be mass produced. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

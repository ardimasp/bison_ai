This research focuses on the problem to motivate employees to share their knowledge and use KMS. Bina Nusantara University in Indonesia becomes the object of the research since the university has implemented KM Portal system. Furthermore, the university has run the KM Award as the reward system. The research method of this study implements a Point Incentive System on the KM Portal for a year and compares the impact with the previous reward system. The reward system used were 1) KM Award System (2018) and 2) Point Incentive System (2019), each of which has been used for one year. This study focuses on comparing the two systems. The research applies quantitative research methodology to measure the number of user contributors and the number of contents in the system. When the numbers show an increase, then this is regarded as the indicator of success. The results show an increase in the number of user contributors by 34.92% and the number of contents by 68.85% stored on the KM Portal. This shows that the application of the KM Point Incentive System is more successful in promoting employees’ motivation to use KMS. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

This study developed a system to detect traffic congestion in Indonesia, especially DKI Jakarta. The system displays the direction of the street according to the name of the street being passed and from each of the names of the streets, resulting in a tweet from the classification. The proposed method uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification with the sigmoid kernel. This study shows that the SVM classification with the sigmoid kernel (libSVM) has an accuracy rate of 96.24% and that was increased by 2.68% when compared to SVM dot (mySVM). Based on the evaluation result of the proposed system compare to google maps application on detecting traffic congestion, the system could find a similar condition as many as 17 times from 25 of testing. © 2019 The Authors.

Each structure has its own axioms and properties. In some cases, to test what kind of structure is a given set and operations is difficult to be done manually. To help this, an application program to test algebraic structures is developed. In this article, we focus on two structures: division ring and fields, and an application program to test them is created by using Java, an open-source based programming language. This application program provides testing of various input of finite set such as integers, matrices and alphabets. By this application, testing of algebraic structures can be done faster than the manual one and its results are accurate. In this article, we focus on testing division rings and fields, together with some examples. © 2015 The Authors.

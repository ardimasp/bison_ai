To imagine the severances of it, 10.000 KM of highway can be built with that much amount of fund. Several responses has been done by Indonesian government to fight corruption from both prevention and persecution. This work focuses on the development of a web application aimed to provide insight to corruption case per province in Indonesia. The web application was developed using Machine Learning, specifically Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Web crawling and web scraping techniques are used to gather news content from 7 major news portal in Indonesia. Accuracy is measured by comparing correct prediction by ANN to its true value. Upon finding corruption news, data is saved and further analysis is done to establish the number of corruption news per region. Finally, the output is visualized using Google Map API. The purpose of this work is to provide regional depiction of corruption case to give further insight to be used by decision makers. Upon using this web application, objectivity of program development is expected to increase. The final output of the web application is a map of corruption case in Indonesia per region. The accuracy of ANN used in this work to classify corruption and non-corruption news is 96.91 % using Sigmoid Activation Function. © 2018 IEEE.","corruption mapping; corruption prevention; machine learning; web application","Application programs; Backpropagation; Decision making; E-learning; Information management; Learning systems; Mapping; Neural networks; Web crawler; Back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN); corruption prevention; Decision makers; Google map api; Program development; Sigmoid activation function; WEB application; Web scrapings; Crime",,,,"Binus University: 024/KM/PNT/2018","This work is supported by Directorate General of Research and Development Strengthening, Indonesian Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, as a part of National Strategic Institutional Research Grant to Binus University titled “Pengembangan Sistem Pemetaan Kasus Korupsi Berdasarkan Indeks Persepsi Korupsi Dengan Menggunakan Teknik Text Mining” or “The Development of Corruption Case Mapping Based on Corruption Perception Index using Text Mining” with contract number: 024/KM/PNT/2018 and contract date: 6 March 2018.","Pradiptyo, R., Partohap, T.H., Pramashavira, Korupsi Struktural; Analisis Database Korupsi Versi 4 (2001-2015), , http://cegahkorupsi.feb.ugm.ac.id/publikasi-/Database%20Korupsi%20V%204-5April16_RP_VR_THP.pdf, 5 April 2016[Accessed September 2016]; Rose-Ackerman, S., Palifka, B.J., (2016) Corruption and Government: Causes, Consequences, and Reform, 2nd Ed., Cambridge: Cambridge, , University Press; Jain, A.K., Corruption: A review (2001) Journal of Economic Surveys, 15 (1), pp. 71-122; Sommer, U., Bloom, P.B.-N., Arikan, G., Does faith limit immorality? the politics of religion and corruption (2013) Democratization, 20 (2), pp. 287-309; Madsen, F.G., Corruption: A global common evil (2013) The RUSI Journal, 158 (2), pp. 26-38; International, T., Slow, Imperfect Progress Across Asia Pacific, "" 21 February 2018, , https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/slow_imperfect_progress_across_asia_pacific, [Accessed 21 May 2018]; Olken, B.A., Pande, R., (2011) Corruption in developing countries Scholars at HARVARD; International, G., (2018) Corruption Continues to Plague Indonesia, , http://news.gallup.com/poll/157073/corruptioncontinues-plague-indonesia.aspx, [Accessed 21 May 2018]; Henderson, J.V., Kuncoro, A., Corruption in Indonesia (2004) National Bureau of Economic Research, pp. 1-38; Indonesia Corruption Watch Survei Nasional Anti Korupsi, , https://antikorupsi.org/sites/default/files/files/Kajian/Temuan%20Hasil%20Survey%20Anti%20Korupsi%202017.pdf, 26 July 2017.

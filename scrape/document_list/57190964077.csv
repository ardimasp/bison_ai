The focus of this study was HEI in Indonesia, that was the HEI’s National Quality Assurance Standard as a case. To define the component, this study applied a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to clarifying the composition of the EA framework. There were two EA frameworks that had been commonly used in HEI to further analyze the study, which were TOGAF and Zachman. The same process was done to define the HEI governance component. To seek the update education situation in 4.0 era, the exploration search was not just from HEI quality assurance and HEI value chain, but it came also from the future university. As a result, the EA component has seven groups and eight groups of components for HEI. Component between EA and HEI map was used to seek the relationship between components. HEI can use the map as a guideline when deciding to implement EA in their organization. Another result is that there are 16 components that are not directly discussed as Indonesia’s National Quality Assurance Standard. © 2019 ICIC International.","EA framework; Enterprise arhiteture; Higher eduation institution; Institution governanes; Systemati literature review",,,,,,"de Vries, M., van Rensburg, A.C.J., Evaluating and refining the “enterprise arhiteture as strategy” approah and artefats (2009) The South African Journal of Industrial Engineering, 20 (1), pp. 31-44; (2018) University of the Future Bringing Education 4.0: Bringing Education to Life; Jairak, K., Praneetpolgrang, P., Applying IT governane balaned soreard and importane-performane analysis for providing IT governane strategy in university (2013) Information Management & Computer Security, 21 (4), pp. 228-249; Llamosa-Villalba, R., Carreño, L.T., Paez, Q.A.M., Delgado, Q.D.J., Barajas, A.B., Sney-Der, E.G., (2015) Enterprise Arhiteture of Olombian Higher Eduation, IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE); (2015) Social CRM in Higher Education: Model, Process, Channel Preference, and Critical Success Factors, , Ph.D. Thesis, University of Indonesia; Oderinde, D.O., (2012) Understanding Enterprise Architecture in Four UK Universities, , Ph.D. Thesis, University of Bolton; Tjong, Y., Adi, S., Kosala, R., Prabowo, H., A systemati mapping study on enterprise arhiteture mining (2018) International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Technology, pp. 403-411; Bokor, J., (2012) University of the Future: A Thousand Year Old Industry on the Usp of Profound Hange, , Ernst and Young; Zandi, F., Tavana, M., A fuzzy group multi-riteria enterprise arhiteture framework seletion model (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39 (1), pp. 1165-1173",,,,"ICIC International",,,,,21852766,,,,"English","ICIC Express Lett Part B Appl.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073316162

This study applies Systematic Mapping Studies approach which contains several steps are defining the research question, determining research sources, using the keyword to accomplish finding process, data extraction, and findings analyzed to answer the research question. From the searching process through some database which is ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Digital Library, Emerald Insight, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Inderscience Online, Science Direct, Springer, and Taylor & Francis find 685 papers. Through reading process, as extraction form there are 44 papers as candidate. Each candidate’s paper carefully read to find the specific case or discuss on Higher Education Institution (HEI). As a result there are 12 selected papers. Each selected paper classified using NVIVO12 to classification according to each research question. As a result found that TOGAF and Zachman as a common EAF used for Higher Education. Most HEI wants to improve their business process and affected to policy in organization.

Research stages are done through literature based on End-User Computing Satisfaction (EUCS) satisfaction factor which consists of content, accuracy, timeless, ease of use and format. Questionnaires were developed based on each factor of EUCS and distributed to the user ie the students. Based on the formula Izaac and Michael the results of the sample calculation there are 380 students who become sample. Based on data from questionnaires that have been distributed validation test and reliability of 20 data responder first before further processing. The result of the questionnaire that has been collected is analyzed to the gap between expectation and reality to get user satisfaction on the use of LMS. After obtaining user satisfaction, it is done by Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach to determine what factors influence student's satisfaction by the factor on EUCS. The results show that users are not satisfied with all factors, and factor accuracy is the most important factor in determining user satisfaction, while the most important experience factor is timelines. The results of the open questionnaire, the user provides input for improvements to LMS related to access speed and feature addition and development of mobile-based LMS. © 2018 IEEE.","AHP; analytical hierachy process; end-user computing satisfaction; EUC; learning management systems; LMS","Hierarchical systems; Information management; Students; Surveys; Web browsers; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Ease-of-use; End user computing; Learning management system; Research stages; Student's satisfaction; User satisfaction; Validation test; Human computer interaction",,,,,"Watson, W.R., Watson, S.L., An argument for clarity: What are learning management systems, what are they not, and what should they become?

The curriculum development is a complex process and needs internal or and external data, information and knowledge as well. This study proposed a Knowledge Management model for curriculum development process. The survey was conducted in Bina Nusantara University and interview the staff who were involved in the process of curriculum development to understand the process. Literature studies were applied to develop a model that fit on integration between knowledge management systems as knowledge sources into Learning Management Systems at Bina Nusantara University as case studies. As results, this Knowledge Management model support several stakeholders like Study program, Subject Content Coordinator, Lecturer, Student, and Alumni & Partners to improving existing curriculum development process. © 2016 IEEE.","curriculum development; KM model; knowledge design; Knowledge Management","Bins; Education computing; Information management; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Complex Processes; Curriculum development; Higher education institutions; Knowledge management model; Knowledge management system; Knowledge sources; Learning management system; Literature studies; Curricula",,,,,"Cottrell, S., Linger, B., Shumway, J., Using information contained in the curriculum management information tool (CurrMIT) to capture opportunities for student learning and development (2004) Med.

The technology has shifted the learning paradigm from traditional to online learning. The technology used as tools to support learning activity are curriculum development, content creation, interaction between lecturer and student, and assessment. It is not easy to successfully implement the virtual university because it will spend huge investment for infrastructure. The purpose of this article was to find out key successful factors for virtual university implementation. It was a literature study by reviewing various journal related on virtual university topic. There were 133 papers retrieved by using keyword ""virtual university"" and/ or ""virtual campus"" and those papers were published after the year 2000. Retrieved papers were synthesized into 100 relevant titles, then selected into 32 papers to review. These selected papers were then reviewed to answer the research questions in virtual university area. The research's result finds 12 key successful factors for virtual university implementation.","Key successful factor; Literature review; Online learning; Teaching learning process; Virtual university",,,,,,"Harasim, L., Shift happens: Online education as a new paradigm in learning (2000) Internet High.

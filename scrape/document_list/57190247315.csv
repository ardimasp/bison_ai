During 16 years of service in fulfilling the citizens' need of transportation, Transjakarta is considered to have a fairly good performance, remarked with the addition of 13 corridors until renovation of the bus fleets. In the era of Jakarta Smart City, Transjakarta is now available at citizens' service. The connected transport application (X), which was renowned as the official partner for Jakarta Smart City, is a route-finding application which can be downloaded freely in the citizen smartphone. It has some features which facilitates the users in gaining the information about Transjakarta, such as locating the station nearby, navigating bus position, and looking at bus schedule. X itself, is already implemented in the transportation system of four big cities in Europe (Berlin, London, Prague, and Vilnius). To investigate whether the existence of this application really affects Transjakarta passengers, we have performed a survey-based research by visiting the largest and the busiest Transjakarta station at Harmoni, in the capital. The Transjakarta passengers are interviewed to get an information about how effective X in providing information about Transjakarta. As the result of this research, the respondents are divided into three groups: those who know X and using it, those who know X, but don't use it, and those who don't know about X at all. © 2020 IEEE.","Connected transport; Indonesia; Mobile application; Passengers; Transjakarta","Information management; Smart city; Bus fleets; Indonesia; Mobile applications; Public transportation; Route findings; Survey-based research; Transport applications; Transportation system; Buses",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

The methods may vary for each university, but most of the modern universities today use a Learning Management Systems (LMS). The LMS application is widely used by the lecturers and students of Bina Nusantara University called BINUMAYA. The system was originally created as a website application, but now its mobile version is also available and is widely used by amongst the students and the lecturers. However, the existing student version of the mobile application have two separate applications, that function almost identically with the official BINUMAYA system. We are interested in finding out the students' perceptions about the two applications. Therefore, we ran a user survey on BINUS students that were randomly selected by convenience sampling. Respondents were asked several questions related to performance, trustworthiness and preferability using the applications. The data collected was analysed using the two mean difference tests for each variable. Our findings showed that the students have a few reasons on why they prefer to choose one application compared to the other and, why they only trust the information presented by the official mobile LMS. © 2020 IEEE.","E-Learning; Learning Management System; Mobile LMS; Student Preference","Information management; Students; Learning management system; Mean difference test; Mobile applications; Mobile Learning; User surveys; Learning systems",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

The hospital located in DKI Jakarta (Indonesia) that has implemented the KM system as a pilot project is the population of this research. Where the respondents are medical personnel at the hospital. This study analyzes the correlation between the use of KM systems and the performance of hospital services, using independent-samples T-tests and ANOVA tests from SPSS and R Commander programs to prove the hypothesis of the two variables, namely the use of KM systems (capabilities) and hospital services performance. The results of this research have succeeded in proving that there are significant differences between medical personnel who rarely use the KM system and who often use it, with those who often have a greater level of service performance. Thus, it can be concluded that the KM system used by hospital has a positive effect seen in the performance of medical personnel. © 2019 IEEE.","hospital; KM System; services performance","Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Personnel; Hospital service; Independent samples t tests; Km systems; Knowledge management system; Level of Service; Medical personnel; Pilot projects; services performance; Hospitals",,,,"Binus University","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research supported by the Grant from PDUPT and Bina Nusantara University (BINUS).","Gusman, I., (2013) Pointers Ketua DPD RI Dalam Seminar Asosiasi Rumah Sakit Daerah, , http://www.irmangusman.com/sambutanketua-dpd-ri-dalam-seminar-asosiasi-rumah-sakit-daerah/, September 3 Retrieved Februari 14 2019; Wibisono, S., (2013) Kasus Malpraktek di Indonesia, , http://www.tempo.co/read/news/2013/03/25/058469172/Terjadi-182-Kasus-Malpraktek-di-Balikpapan, Maret 25 Retrieved Januari 23 2019; Gold, A.H., Malhotra, A., Segars, A.H., Knowledge management: An organizational capabilities perspective (2001) Journal of Management Information Systems, 18 (1), pp. 185-214. , Summer; Faust, B., Schweiz, N., (2015) Implementation of Tacit Knowledge Preservation and Transfer Methods, , http://www.fraserhealth.ca/media/Implementation-of-Tacit-Knowledge-Presevation-and-Transfer-Methods.pdf, Retrieved Mei 12; Bennet, A., Bennet, D., (2004) Organizational Survival in the New World: The Intelligent Complex Adaptive System, , Boston: Elsevier; (2010) Knowledge Management and Information.

Government has spent a lot of time, money, and sources to improve the public service but there are always challenges to improve public interest in using social media-based e-government applications. Web 2.0 and social media provide opportunities to user that is the community, stakeholders, and service providers to discuss and share opinions about features regarding people’s expectations. This study involved 349 people as end users and 10 service providers in producing e-government features based on social media according to their expectations. Society as application’s user was asked to see the current quality of social media-based e-government services based on end users. This aimed to conduct evaluations so that they could propose features for the development of social media-based e-government application. © 2019, ICIC International.

Business process simulation applications has two major subsystems, namely wholesale and retail sales. The business activities that will be developed in the business process simulation system are the incoming inquiries, sales orders, delivery and billing. In addition there is also a part of the procurement cycle such as purchase orders. With this software, the students will be able directly interact with the simulation systems and business process practice has been applied to the industry. In this application there are some additional features that support simulation analysis, such as wholesale analysis and billing list generation process. And there are also features related reporting process such as purchase order reports, reports of wholesale and retail sales orders, profits and loss, cash flow, balance sheet and capital reports. We hope through research and development of this system, the students will get an overview of the actual business process-related business processes of sales, distribution, and business workflow in the company. By creating a business process simulation applications, we hope this application can help students to learn the business processes of sales and distribution processes more effectively.","Business process; Information systems; Learning activities; Simulation; Systems design","Computer software; File organization; Information systems; Purchasing; Students; Systems analysis; Business activities; Business Process; Business process simulation; Learning Activity; Research and development; Sales and distribution; Simulation; Simulation analysis; Sales",,,,,,"Achimugu, P., Oluwagbemi, O., Oluwaranti, A., An evaluation of the impact of ICT diffusion in Nigeria’s higher educational institutions (2010) Journal of Information Technology Impact; Serrano, A., Hengst, M., Modeling the integration of BP and IT using business process simulation (2005) Journal or Enterprise Information Management, 18 (6), pp. 740-759; Popovic, A., Jaklic, J., Problematika simuliranja poslovnih procesov (2004) Proceedings of DSI 2004 - Management in Informatika, pp. 166-172. , Portoroz; Barber, K.D., Dewhurst, F.W., Burns, R.L.D., Rogers, J.B.B., Business-process modelling and simulation for manufacturing management: A practical way forward (2003) Business Process Management Journal, 9 (4), pp. 527-542; Damij, N., Damij, T., A Multi-disciplinary Guide to Theory, Modeling, and Methodology (2014) Progress in IS, , Berlin Heidelberg: Springer; Patig, S., Stolz, M., A pattern-based approach for the verification of business process descriptions (2013) Information and Software Technology, 55 (1), pp. 58-87. , Special section: Best papers from the 2nd International Symposium on Search Based Software Engineering, 2010; Savén, R., Olhager, J., Integration of product, process and functional orientations: Principles and a case study (2003) Collaborative Systems for Production Management, 129, pp. 375-389. , In: Jagdev H, Wortmann J, Pels H, editors. of IFIP—The International Federation for Information Processing.

The analysis and modelling method used was in accordance with ITIL v3 (2011), one of the most widely used IT management tools. It was found that employees experiencing work overload can benefit greatly from the establishment of knowledge management. Previously, there was limited knowledge management in PT X, and also, it was not specific to the needs of PT X. Expected results of this research were a change in process and establishment of a new function within PT X. This project will benefit users in improving processes, gathering and distributing knowledge and offloading some amount of workload experienced by technical account managers in PT X by using knowledge management. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Delivery; ITIL; Knowledge management; Services",,,,,,,"Barclay, R., Murray, P., What is knowledge management?

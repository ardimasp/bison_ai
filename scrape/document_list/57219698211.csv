Model development is based on the IS success model of DeLone and Mclean by adding instructor activity and motivational variables based on related literature studies. Evaluation is done by testing the reliability and validity of the instrument. Data collection by distributing instruments online with the snowball method, respondents obtained were 234 used as data analysis with SmartPLS 2.0 software. The results of this study produced a conceptual model consisting of 9 variables and 83 instruments which were validated according to the provisions. From these results, it can be implemented in future research by increasing larger respondents to get results that represent the success of e-learning systems at universities in Indonesia. © 2019 IEEE.","Conceptual Model; E-learning; Instructor; IS success model DeLone and McLean; motivation","E-learning; Instrument testing; Motivation; Conceptual model; Data collection; Indonesia; IS success model; Literature studies; Model development; Reliability and validity; User motivation; Learning systems",,,,,"Fernando, E., An E-learning system architecture based on cloud computing (2014) World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, 16, pp. 1-4; Stacie Petter, E.R.M., DeLone, W., Information Systems Success: The Quest for the Dependent Variable (1992) Inf.

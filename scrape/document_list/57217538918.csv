One use of the CNN method is to classify images. This study uses the CNN method to classify image datasets that have landmark categories. The results show that each model has an accuracy level with the highest value of 95% and the lowest value of 92%. The method for this research to produce a service that can be used by other services and or can be implemented in other resources so that the classification function can be used or developed. We show that our deployment method has good results seen with ResNet50 Model using 1200 concurrent users which response rates were smaller by 4,92% using autoscaling pods with one minimum pod and 6 maximum pods that had an error value of 26,58% compared with the best result from the other method. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

It does not understand and capable of doing natural conversation with human. To build a system that can naturally understand and communicate with human, it is essential to train the system with natural conversation data. This paper proposes a dataset which consists of natural dyadic conversation in Indonesian language. Where literature suggested that there are exists inadequate number of conversation dataset in Indonesian Language. There are 3164 words (formal and slang (informal nonstandard words) annotated from the recording of five groups, with the largest number of words belong to Food topic (Group 3, 826 words), and the lowest one belongs to Travelling topic (Group 2, 372 words). The dataset contributes a pre-trained conversation model with deep learning (LSTM). The model is trained in 10000 iterations, 128 batches, and 4 hidden layers, resulted in a perplexity of 2.01. © 2018 The Author(s).","Corpus; Dyadic; Indonesian Datasets; LSTM; Natural Conversation","Deep learning; Corpus; Dyadic; Indonesians; LSTM; Natural Conversation; Long short-term memory",,,,"Nvidia","We gratefully acknowledge the support of NVIDIA Corporation with the donation of the Titan X Pascal GPU used for this research, and the support of BINUS University Grant 2017 to support the operational for this research.","Chowanda, A., Flintham, M., Blanchfield, P., Valstar, M., Playing with social and emotional game companions (2016) International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents, pp. 85-95. , Springer; Chowanda, A., Blanchfield, P., Flintham, M., Valstar, M., Computational models of emotion, personality, and social relationships for interactions in games (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Autonomous Agents & Multiagent Systems.

In mammography classification, accuracy is determined by feature extraction methods and classifier. In this study, we propose a mammogram classification using Law's Texture Energy Measure (LAWS) as texture feature extraction method. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used as classifier for normal- abnormal and benign-malignant images. Training data for the mammogram classification model is retrieved from MIAS database. Result shows that LAWS provides better accuracy than other similar method such as GLCM. LAWS provide93.90% accuracy for normal-abnormal and 83.30% for benign-malignant classification, while GLCM only provides 72.20% accuracy for normal-abnormal and 53.06% for benign-malignant classification. © 2015 The Authors.

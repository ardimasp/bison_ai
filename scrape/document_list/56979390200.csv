The game will use Procedural Content Generation to minimize the amount of resource needed and incorporating the theme that will be beneficial to learn something about Mental Illness. A game that were made using Procedural Content Generation, but there are not yet a game that combines this with a Tangential learning element of Mental Illness. This thesis focuses on the development of the game from the start to finish and conduct game test to see how effective it is as an enjoyable game that indirectly give someone new information about Mental Illness. This testing is done by doing a post-test survey to measure the player’s experience, whether they learned something new or not and whether their experience is enjoyable or not. Based on the survey, the majority of players answered that they have learned something new and/or received the message of the game, and they rated their experience as good. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Pancasila as a Indonesia Ideology, so young people must understand about Pancasila value. As Indonesian people, millennial generation lack of sense of nationalism because they don't understand about Pancasila value. They prefer interested to learn foreign culture than learning Pancasila value. Because of that to attract young people learning Pancasila value, it is must using interesting way for learning. Along with this research, the writer wants to Enhance Learning Experience through Visual Novel Game Genre. Researches uses User Experience Questionnaire to calculate overall participants reaction about what they experienced about The Friendship Game. The Friendship game have 5 chapters in total, the name of the chapters itself are inherited from Pancasila. The result show that while The Friendship game could relay the moral of the story very well, The game also Motivate the users to apply Pancasila morals into their everyday life and simultaneously increase the users knowledge about Pancasila and its principal seeds, The Character Design, The User Interface, and Layout Design itself should be taken into consideration as they could affect the users overall experience. So it could be concluded that The Friendship Visual Novel Game has an story that could relay the message inside to the users, motivate the users to apply Pancasila in their daily life and also increase their overall knowledge about Pancasila. © 2020 IEEE.","Learning experience; Pancasila value; User experience; User interface","Human computer interaction; Information management; User interfaces; Character designs; Daily lives; Enhance learning; Indonesia; Layout designs; Video game; Young peoples; User experience",,,,,"Game, P., Visual, E., Berbasis, N., Karakter, P., Materi, P., (2013) Unnes Journal of Biology Education PENGEMBANGAN GAME EDUKASI VISUAL NOVEL BERBASIS, p. 2; Education, P., Untuk, G., Hasil, M., Ipa, B., Konsep, B., Makhluk, K., (2012) Jurnal Pendidikan IPA Indonesia, 1, pp. 75-81; Yudhanti, R., Pancasila dan berbagai permasalahan aktual (2016) Semin Nas Huk Univ Negeri Semarang, 2, pp. 599-610; Puji Asmaroini, A., Menjaga eksistensi pancasila dan penerapannya bagi masyarakat di era globalisasi (2017) J Pancasila Dan Kewarganegaraan; Irhandayaningsih, A., Peranan pancasila dalam menumbuhkan kesadaran nasionalisme generasi muda di era global (2012) Humanika, 16, pp. 1-10; Hamari, J., Shernoff, D.J., Rowe, E., Coller, B., Asbell-Clarke, J., Edwards, T., Challenging games help students learn: An empirical study on engagement, flow and immersion in game-based learning (2016) Comput Human Behav, 54, pp. 170-179; Divjak, B., Tomic, D., The impact of gamebased learning on the achievement of learning goals and motivation for learning mathematics-literature review (2011) Journal of Information and Organizational Sciences, 35, pp. 15-30; Magister, P., Keahlian, B., Grafika, I., Seni, D.A.N., Informatika, J.T., Informasi, F.T., (2017) EFEKTIVITAS PENGGUNAAN GAME EDUKASI BERJENIS PUZZLE, RPG DAN PUZZLE RPG; Fujimoto, T., Shigeta, K., (2017) The Research Trends in Game-Based Learning and Open Education the Research Trends in Game-Based Learning and Open; Proulx, J., Romero, M., Arnab, S., Mechanics under the perspective of self-determination theory to foster motivation in digital game based learning (2016) Simulation & Gaming, Learning Mechanics and Game Mechanics under the Perspective of Self-Determination Theory to Foster Motivation in Digital Game Based Learning; Zhonggen, Y., (2019) A Meta-Analysis of Use of Serious Games in Education 2019; Pho, A., Dinscore, A., Game-based learning overview and definition (2015) Tips Trends Instr Technol Commitee, pp. 1-5; We Are IntechOpen, the World's Leading Publisher of Open Access Books Built by Scientists, for Scientists TOP 1, , Access O; Li, J., Ma, S., Ma, L., (2012) The Study on the Effect of Educational Games for the Development of Students ' Logic-mathematics of Multiple Intelligence, 33, pp. 1749-1752; Zirawaga, V.S., (2017) Gaming in Education: Using Games As A Support Tool to Teach History, 8, pp. 55-64; Noemí, P., Máximo, S.H., (2014) Educational Games for Learning, 2, pp. 230-238; Bashova, K., Pachovski, V., (2016) Visual Novel; Pratama, D., Gunarti, W., Wardani, W., Akbar, T., (2018) The Visual Elements Strength in Visual Novel Game Development As the Main Appeal, 33, pp. 326-333; Laugwitz, B., Held, T., Schrepp, M., Construction and evaluation of a user experience questionnaire (2008) Symposium of the Austrian HCI and Usability Engineering Group, pp. 63-76. , November.

Teenagers have problems when studying biology which consists of many foreign terms, and many abstract theories. Teachers also find it difficult to convey the material so students can easily understand it and attract students' attention. To attract the attention of teenagers so that they are easy to understand, digital technology is needed that has an attractive visual and interface. Augmented Reality (AR) technology provides a new way of learning for teenagers in learning. AR has been widely applied in the delivery of learning materials such as mathematics, physics, astronomy. Therefore AR can also be used in delivering biology material. Users who, on average, need a design interface that suits their needs. Researchers are now also starting to conduct research to find suitable modeling for the needs of teenagers commonly known as Teen-Computing Interaction. To help overcome the obstacles of teenagers in learning the Animal Taxonomy, the researchers propose developing a multimedia-based application by applying Augmented Reality technology that implements the design of a Teen-Computer Interaction based interface. © 2019 IEEE.","Augmented Reality; biology; Multimedia; Teen-Computer Interaction","Animals; Augmented reality; Computation theory; Students; Taxonomies; Abstract theory; Augmented reality technology; Computer interaction; Design interface; Digital technologies; Interactive applications; Learning materials; Taxonomy learning; Engineering education",,,,,"Nafisah, D., (2011) Identifikasi Kesulitan Belajar Ipa Biologi Siswa Kelas Ix Smp Negeri 5; Insani, M.D., Studi pendahuluan identifikasi kesulitan dalam pembelajaran pada guru ipa smp se-kota malang (2016) Jurnal Pendidikan Biologi, 2, pp. 81-93; Wahyudin, Sutikno, Isa, A., Keefektifan pembelajaran berbantuan multimedia menggunakan metode inkuiri terbimbing untuk meningkatkan minat dan pemahaman siswa.

Several web applications offering this type of services have emerged, but they did not come without limitations to certain products and feature availabilities in them. The limitations to individual personal shoppers were raised as the problems that will be discussed in this study. The purpose of this research was to develop an application that can open an opportunity for anyone to become an entrepreneur as well as requester or personal shopper customer. This research involved literature review, comparative analysis of similar applications, application design and evaluation with proportion testing to compare the proportion of users who agreed to those who disagreed with the statements related to the variables evaluated. In addition, an independent test was also performed to find out about the variables related to users' satisfaction with the application. The researchers suggest developing an e-commerce application with an addition of a bidding feature to increase the level of requester-traveler interaction. From the evaluation results, it can be proven that Nitipyuk is useful and easy to use for users. It only needs improvement in the user interface design to better attract users. © 2019 The Authors.

Attractive learning tools can increase the interest of young people or millennial generations, especially for learning conceptual or too theoretical. Pancasila as the basis of the Indonesian nation's life view needs to be understood by the Indonesian people, especially the younger generation. But the way of learning about the Pancasila is currently too theoretical and does not attract young people. Therefore, by making the game that is liked and favorited by young people today is used to study the Pancasila. Through this research the author wants to analyze the factors that can affect learning experience using game-based learning. Researchers use multiple linear regression methods to analyze these factors. The game prototype developed in this study uses the visual novel genre which has an interesting story. There are 101 respondents as samples. The analysis showed that there are two factors that influence game-based learning, namely the gameplay factor and the story of the game. So, it can be concluded that for developing game based learning we need to pay attention to these two factors and through this visual novel prototype game, it can be concluded that the prototype of this game has an interesting game play and a story that is easy to understand. © 2019 The Authors.

It happens on all language include Indonesian Language. There are many previous research that related with plagiarism detection in Indonesian Language with different method. But there are still some part that still has opportunity to improve. This research proposed the solution that can improve the plagiarism detection technique that can detect not only copy paste form but more advance than that. The proposed solution is using Winnowing with some addition process in pre-processing stage.

The government has an important role in economic growth. However, there are still many civil servants who abuse their positions to do corruption. The central government should pay more attention to each region to avoid corruption cases. For developing a mapping system, Naïve Bayes classifier is needed to classify news about corruption and non-corruption. N-Gram and Hash Table were used to map corruption cases based on Indonesia’s administrative territory. The experimental results showed that Naïve Bayes classification achieved 100% accuracy for training and testing. However, N-Gram and Hash Table achieved 85% accuracy for mapping the location of the article. © 2018 ICIC International.","Corruption; Corruption perception index; Indonesia; System development",,,,,,"(2014), http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/indonesia/overview; (2017), http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/GDP.pdf; Noerlina, L.A.W., Sasmoko, A.M.M., Alamsyah, M., Corruption cases mapping based on Indonesia’s corruption perception index (2017) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 801 (1); (2017), http://www.corruptionwatch.org.za/learn-about-corruption/what-is-corruption/our-definition-of-corruption; Siddique, M., Ghosh, R., (2014) Corruption, Good Governance and Economic Development: Contemporary Analysis and Case Studies, , World Scientific Publishing, Singapore; (2009), https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/the_anti_corruption_plain_language_guide; Shah, A., Schacter, M., Combinating corruption: Look before you leap (2004) Finance Development, 4, pp. 40-43; Mauro, P., Why Worry about Corruption?

The instrument used is a USE Questionnaire to obtain user satisfaction data. Atisa Dipamkara High School has been using an online application system to process the Students Grade. The application system is a web-based information system to assist the process of making the student reports every semester. This paper discusses the method of measuring the level of use of the application of student grade processing in Atisa Dipamkara High School. One factor in measuring the quality of an information system is usability. Usability level refers to the ease of use of such information systems or software. The higher the usability value means the higher the benefits of the information system in helping the users. This measurement of usability is using USE Questionnaire consisting of 3 parameters namely benefits (usefulness), ease to use and ease to learn. Data collection involves 25 teachers as user respondents of this information system. The result of usability measurement will have the value of «feasibility» and proof that there is significant influence between usefulness variable, ease to use and ease to learn to user satisfaction variable. © 2018 The Authors.

Due to the ease of developing AR by non-professionals, User Experience (UX) is often not considered in the application. Currently, there are no standard measurements of UX for AR applications especially in Education. The authors reviewed previous research to obtain UX references and the existing measurement standards. From the results of the review, the metrics were analyzed based on the characteristics of AR, especially in the field of education. The metrics will be recommended for the UX measurement of an AR application. The available standard metrics can be used to determine the UX quality of an AR application and contribute to the improvement of UX in AR applications, especially in the field of Education. © 2018 The Authors.

The higher the number of participant, the longer and the more exhausted the players. This paper suggests Swiss pairing system to do scheduling in Xiang Qi tournament. The capacity of the tournament can be increased, but the player can still compete with the optimal result. The pairing function considers the player's record, the 'bye' notes, the player's color preferences, and the origin of the player's club.

It caused by potential of China's economic growth in the world. Chinese language has introduced to children in early age in Indonesia. But sometimes learn Chinese language was difficult to them, which will make them feel boring. This paper has purpose to help children learn Chinese language using gamification and mnemonic method into game content. Briefly, gamification is process that adopt game elements to apply into non-game context and mnemonic is strategy to increase memory with various ways. Both in gamification and mnemonic method have applied in previous paper which the conclusion showed positive result in learning environment. This game refers to primary school, which students in 6-12 years old. The conclusion in this paper show that the developed game by authors can interest children to learn Chinese language based by pre-test and post-test result. © 2017 The Authors.

However, the limitation of the length that can be written is about 160 characters and the text is in unstructured sentence. It becomes the biggest obstacle to process the information. Those unstructured sentences cause a difficulty for preprocessing in text processing tools. Therefore, normalization is needed to make the unstructured sentences can be more understandable by a machine. We proposed a normalization of Indonesian language method which adopting some ideas of normalization from other researchers and adjust to the problem of Indonesian characteristic in unstructured sentence. The experiment exploits Twitter data which use Indonesian language in complaint category. The process is divided into three stages, which are cleaning process, OOV detection and word replacement. List of Basic words and Slang dictionary are used in the OOV detection. On the other hand, Context dictionary is built to solve the ambiguity problem. The algorithm can reaches the accuracy about 90% in a complaint category. © 2017 The Authors.

The current technology development makes the classic games have to adapt by converting the style of play, such as online version of the classic game. N-tier architecture provides a model for software developers to create an application which has a high flexibility and reusability. By dividing the application into some tiers, developers have options to modify or add a particular layer, instead of changing the whole application. The implementation of n-tier can be done by supporting with internet. The combination of Xiang Qi with online game technology based on web is expected to be successful in attracting the attention of gamers/players. The paper presents a re-packaging of conventional games into an online game application which built using n-tier developing approach that can manage accessibility and interactivity of the games. © 2015 The Authors.

Service-Now is an application used by the service desk division at PT Aero System Indonesia for the needs of customer reports. Many employees face obstacles in operational service-now, so the resulting report is not optimal. In this study will measure the level of user satisfaction on the service-now application. The study was conducted by taking a survey involving 32 staff in the service desk division as respondents. An approach the Importance Performance Analysis (IPA) is used to analyse the data. The results of analysis show ease of use, completeness of a function or feature, and timely enough to satisfy the user. Meanwhile, quality of information needs to be increased in service-now applications to improve user satisfaction. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Condensed matter physics; Engineering; Industrial engineering; Materials science; Application systems; Ease-of-use; Importance-performance analysis; Indonesia; Operational service; Quality of information; User satisfaction; User's satisfaction; Surveys",,,,,"Saif, U.M., Customer Satisfaction, Perceived Service Quality and Mediating Role of Perceived Value (2012) International Journal of Marketing Studies, 4, pp. 68-76; Delone, W.H., McLean, E.R., The DeLone and McLean model of information systems success: A ten-year update (2003) Journal of Management Information Systems, 19 (4), pp. 9-30; Lee, H.S., Kim, J.W., Student User Satisfaction with Web-Based Information Systems in Korea University (2010) International Journal of Business and Management, 5, pp. 62-68; Guimaraes, T., Staples, D.S., McKeen, J.D., Empirically testing some main user-related factors for systems development quality (2003) The Quality Management Journal, 10 (4), pp. 39-54; Sfenrianto, Girsang, A.S., Ruman, F., Analysis of satisfaction factor for development recommendation tourism web system (2016) Journal of Environmental Management and Tourism, 7, pp. 156-163; Masa'Deh, R.E., Al-Badi, A., Abu-Hlalah, A., Alkyal, R., Zytoon, S., Factors Affecting User's Satisfaction of Tourism Board Website and Its Impact on Continuous Intention to Use (2017) International Journal of Business Administration, 8 (4), pp. 1-15; Chen, J.V., Jubilado, R.J.M., Capistrano, E.P.S., Yen, D.C., Factors affecting online tax filing-An application of the IS Success Model and trust theory (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, 43, pp. 251-262; Dicky, S., Tjhai, F.J., Analisa Pengaruh Kepuasan Pengguna Public Computer terhadap Efisiensi dan Efektivitas Mahasiswa Trisakti School of Management (2006) Jurnal Bisnis Dan Akuntansi, 8, pp. 111-134; Gelinas, J.U., Dull Richard, B., Wheeler Patrick, R., (2012) Accounting Information Systems, , (South Western: Cengage Learning); Kassim, E.S., Jailani, S.F.A., Hairuddin, H., Zamzuri, N.H., Information system acceptance and user satisfaction: The mediating role of trust (2012) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 57, pp. 412-418; O'Brien, J.A., Marakas, G.M., (2005) Introduction to Information Systems, , (New York City, USA: McGraw-Hill); Eppler, M.J., (2006) Managing Information Quality: Increasing the Value of Information in Knowledge-intensive Products and Processes, , (Springer Science amp; Business Media); Koivumäki, T., Ristola, A., Kesti, M., The effects of information quality of mobile information services on user satisfaction and service acceptance-empirical evidence from Finland (2008) Behaviour & Information Technology, 27 (5), pp. 375-385",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","2nd Nommensen International Conference on Technology and Engineering, NICTE 2018","19 July 2018 through 20 July 2018",,140093,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

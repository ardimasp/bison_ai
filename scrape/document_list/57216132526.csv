The method used in this research including calculation of vehicles operating costs, Likert method, and distribution frequency. The results in summary is VOC of the type of Zhongtong LCK6180GC is smaller than Scania K3201A. Passengers' satisfaction of Zhongtong LCK6180GC is lower then Scania K3201A but Zhongtong LCK6180GC gives more benefits for PT. Transportation Jakarta compare to Scania K3201A. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Passenger Perception; Tariff; Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC)","Buses; Operating costs; Comparison analysis; Jakarta; Level of satisfaction; Tariff; Cost benefit analysis",,,,,"Warpani, S., (1990) Merencanakan Sistem Perangkutan.

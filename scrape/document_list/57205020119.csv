Based on data from 'The Role of SMEs in Asia and Their Difficulties in Accessing Finance', one of the four countries in Asia with the largest percentage of SMEs is Indonesia (99.9%). The authors will conduct this particular investigation on SMEs as they play a vital role and have a huge impact on the economic development of Indonesia. According to survey results from Price Waterhouse Coopers in 2014 regarding family businesses, 95% of businesses in Indonesia are owned or managed by families. Previous findings from family enterprise research show how family engagement as a function of family business positively affects the relationship between innovation and enterprise success. More than 1.022.213 publications released between 2014 and 2019 were screened using the keywords: digital business adoption, e-business adoption, e-commerce adoption, family commitment, family firms, SME innovation, and SME performance. Eventually, for this study, 21 journals were selected based on this analysis, the conceptual model has four possible connections: the good relationship between digital business adoption and SME achievements; the positive relationship between the adoption of digital business and innovativeness; the positive direct impacts of innovativeness on family-firm performance; and a good relationship between SME performance and family commitment and innovativeness. This research refers to a conceptual framework that could play a major part in the success of SMEs through digital business, family commitment, and innovativeness. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises represent around 97 to 99% of the enterprise population in most ASEAN countries. In Indonesia, small and medium-sized enterprises made up 99.99% of total businesses and employ 97% of the workforce. Based on data from small and medium-sized enterprises that are already using the internet in Indonesia, the use of e-commerce is still between 9 and 15%. One of the innovation types was frugal innovation, which can be defined as products, services, or solutions that arise regardless of financial, human, technological or other resource constraints, and where the end result is cheaper than competitive offers and meets the needs of customers who have not yet been served otherwise. The objective of this research is to investigate the impact of digital business adoption, frugal innovation, and organizational innovation on firm performance. The study was conducted using a descriptive quantitative method in Indonesia. A structured research questionnaire was developed using a Likert scale-four. Data from a total of 100 returned questionnaires was analysed with SEM-PLS. The results of this research show how the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is affected by digital business adoption, frugal innovation and organisational innovation. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

Design/methodology/approach: Research data was collected from the executive management of telecommunication technology providers in Indonesia via a questionnaire survey to obtain 150 valid questionnaires for analysis. This study analyzed the overall model fit through confirmatory factor analysis and causal relationships through structural equation modeling. Findings: The results indicate that market orientation mediates the link between balanced APM and strategic agility and that strategic agility mediates the link between market orientation and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The choice of single telecommunication industry in a single country, Indonesia, provides a limitation on external validity. It is, therefore, suggested to extend the research efforts to other industry sectors in multi-country environments. Originality/value: This study extends the knowledge about agile project management by embracing balancing control enforcement and tests it empirically. This study also re-conceptualizes strategic agility to embrace business partner switching capability and market orientation to embrace the inter-partner coordination dimension. Finally, the results highlight that agile project management needs to be framed by market orientation to create higher value for customers.

This concept then developed rapidly and attracted the attention of many parties. In the last decade knowledge management has become one of the methods of increasing the productivity of an organization, company, or agency. This is understandable because competition no longer relies on natural resources, but instead moves to the optimal use of human resources. Utilization of human resources through the potential for creativity and innovation is done in order to increase the productivity of an organization. One of important knowledge is product knowledge, product knowledge is clearly needed by business people as its main capital in its business activities. The deeper knowledge of the products sold will facilitate the process of marketing the product to the customer. Product knowledge is also one element of good service, because how can we provide the best service if we do not know the advantages or disadvantages of the product. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Design/methodology/approach: Research data were collected from the executive management of telecommunication technology providers in Indonesia via a questionnaire survey to obtain 150 valid questionnaires for analysis. This study analyzed the overall model fit and causal relationship using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings: The results indicate that market orientation fully mediates the link between networking capability-business process agility and balanced APM-business process agility. Furthermore, business process agility mediates the relationship between market orientation and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This study is based on a cross-sectional nature and might fail to capture the dynamic of the studied variables over an extended period. Originality/value: The study extends the knowledge that dynamic capabilities, represented by networking capability and balanced APM, must be framed by market orientation to create customer value and improve bargaining position. However, market orientation alone is not enough in a highly dynamic business environment. Organization also requires business process agility, responsiveness and adaptability to timely address customers' needs and requirements. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business process agility; Firm performance; Market orientation; Networking capability, Balanced agile project management",,,,,,,"Aghina, W., Smet, A.D., Lackey, G., Lurie, M., Murarka, M., (2018) The 5 trademarks of agile organizations, , https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/the-five-trademarks-of-agile-organizations; Agirre, I., Reinares, P., Agirre, A., Antecedents to market orientation in the worker cooperative organization: the Mondragon group (2014) Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, 85 (3), pp. 387-408; Aguirre, F.H., Azcoitia, S.A., Marcos, C.S., (2019) Disrupting Telco Business Through SDN/NFV, , Deloitte, Madrid; Ahlbäck, K., Fahrbach, C., Murarka, M., Salo, O., (2017) How to create an agile organization, , https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/how-to-create-an-agile-organization; Ahuja, G., The duality of collaboration: inducements and opportunities in the formation of interfirm linkages (2000) Strategic Management Journal, 21, pp. 317-343; Alavi, S., Wahab, D.A., Muhamad, N., Shirani, B.A., Organic structure and organisational learning as the main antecedents of workforce agility (2014) International Journal of Production Research, 52 (21), pp. 6273-6295; Alpkan, L., Yilmaz, C., Kaya, N., Market orientation and planning flexibility in SMEs: performance implications and an empirical investigation (2007) International Small Business Journal, 25 (2), pp. 152-172; Altay, N., Gunasekaran, A., Dubey, R., Childe, S.J., Agility and resilience as antecedents of supply chain performance under moderating effects of organizational culture within the humanitarian setting: a dynamic capability view (2018) Production Planning and Control, 29 (14), pp. 1158-1174. , Taylor and Francis; Ambroise, L., Prim-allaz, I., Teyssier, C., Financial performance of servitized manufacturing firms: a configuration issue between servitization strategies and customer-oriented organizational design (2017) Industrial Marketing Management, 71, pp. 54-68. , Elsevier; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: a review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 411-423; Anderson, E., Jap, S.D., The dark side of close relationships (2005) MIT Sloan Management Review, 46 (3), pp. 75-82; Andersson, T., Cäker, M., Tengblad, S., Wickelgren, M., Building traits for organizational resilience through balancing organizational structures (2019) Scandinavian Journal of Management, 35 (1), pp. 36-45. , Elsevier; Annosi, M.C., Magnusson, M., Martini, A., Appio, F.P., Social conduct, learning and innovation: an abductive study of the dark side of agile software development (2016) Creativity and Innovation Management, 25 (4), pp. 515-535; Arnett, D.B., Sandvik, I.L., Sandvik, K., Two paths to organizational effectiveness – product advantage and life-cycle flexibility (2018) Journal of Business Research, 84 (March), pp. 285-292; Atkinson, H., Brown, J.B., Rethinking performance measures: assessing progress in UK hotels (2001) International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 13 (3), pp. 128-136; Atuahene-Gima, K., Ko, A., An empirical investigation of the effect of market orientation and entrepreneurship orientation alignment on product innovation (2001) Organization Science, 12 (1), pp. 54-74; Bajpai, R., Nesargi, S., Merchant, K., Pareek, V., (2015) Operationalizing SDN and NFV Networks, , Deloitte Consulting LLP, Dallas, Texas; Balashova, E.S., Gromova, E.A., Agile project management in telecommunications industry (2017) Espacios, 38, p. 41; Barnabas, N., Mekoth, N., Autonomy, market orientation and performance in Indian retail banking (2010) Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics, 22 (3), pp. 330-350; Barney, J., Firm resource and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Barney, J.B., Ketchen, D.J., Wright, M., The future of resource-based theory: revitalization or decline?

Design/methodology/approach: Research data was collected from the executive management of telecommunication technology providers in Indonesia via a questionnaire survey to obtain 150 valid questionnaires for analysis. This study analysed the overall model fit and hypotheses through confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Findings: The results reveal that networking capability has a positive and significant effect on market orientation. However, networking capability does not have a significant direct effect on business process agility. The results also indicate that market orientation does not have a significant direct effect on firm performance but through the mediating role of business process agility. Practical implications: The findings provide a practical foundation for the organisation’s networking capability to be framed by market orientation and business process agility to enhance firm performance. Originality/value: The results indicate that market orientation mediates the relationship between networking capability and business process agility.

They reveal that Indonesia's ""Digital Islands"" are the largest internet user-base in the Southeast Asian region (150 million internet users in 2018), generate the largest internet economy ($27 billion in the year 2018) and operate the fastest-growing internet economy in Southeast Asia. However, the use of E-commerce itself in the sector of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia is still only between 9-15 %. The objective of this review is to establish a theoretical model that links digital business adoption, organizational innovation, frugal innovation type, and firm performance. A systematic literature review (SLR) is the method used for the critical review. The critical result of the review is used as the basis for the development of the concept. More than 864,000 publications released between 2014 and 2019 were screened using the keywords: digital business adoption, e-business adoption, e-commerce adoption, type of innovation, frugal innovation, organisational innovation, and firm performance. Eventually, for this study, 23 journals were included. Based on the analysis, the conceptual model has four possible connections: (1) The positive relationship between digital business adoption and SME achievements; (2) the good relationship between the adoption of digital businesses and organisational innovation; (3) the positive direct impacts of organizational innovations on company performance; and (4) a positive relationship exists between digital business adoption and frugal innovation type and organizational innovation. This study contributes a conceptual framework that digital business adoption, frugal innovation type, and organisational innovation might have important roles in the performance of SMEs. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Digitl business; Organisational performance; SMEs",,,,,,,"Abebe, M., Electronic Commerce Adoption, Entrepreneurial Orientation And Small-And Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME) performance (2014) Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, 21 (1), pp. 100-116. , https://doi.org/10.1108/JSBED-10-2013-0145; (2019) Pasar IdEA 2019 Hadir Untuk Pertama Kalinya Di Indonesia, , https://www.idea.or.id/berita/detail/pasar-idea-2019-hadir-untuk-pertama-kalinya-di-indonesia; Ballot, G., Fakhfakh, F., Galia, F., Salter, A., The fateful triangle: Complementarities in performance between product, process and organizational innovation in France and the UK ?

It has transformed itself into not just a platform for social interactions, but into a powerful marketing tool. People posting pictures or information through social media will likely influence others seeing it. This research investigates the impact of social media postings on millennial (Gen Y) tourists’ decision in choosing destinations, as well as the perceptions of social media users toward the information they gather from the social media about the tourism destinations. World Travel and Tourism Council in its release in 2018 revealed that tourism industry represents 10.4% of total global GDP. The industry has also contributed 20% of new jobs globally created in the last decade. The findings from samples taken from respondents in greater Jakarta (Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang and Bekasi) show that social media contributes significantly on shaping the millennial tourists’ decision in choosing their holiday destinations. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Decision on destination; Impact; Perception; Social media; Tourists’ destination",,,,,,,"Bialik, K., Matsa, K.E., (2017) Key Trends in Social and Digital News Media, p. 4. , Pew Research Center; Dudensing, R.M., Hughes, D.W., Shields, M., Perceptions of tourism promotion and business challenges: A survey-based comparison of tourism businesses and promotion organizations (2011) Tourism Management, 32 (6), pp. 1453-1462; Felix, R., Rauschnabel, P.A., Hinsch, C., Elements of strategic social media marketing: A holistic framework (2017) Journal of Business Research, 70, pp. 118-126; Kovathanakul, D., Central Northeastern Thailand Tourism Branding, Supporting the ASEAN Economic Community (2015) Procedia Economics and Finance, 23, pp. 291-297; Lin, J., The effects of gratifications on intention to read citizen journalism news: The mediating effect of attitude (2014) Computers in Human Behavior, 36, pp. 129-137; Malik, A., Dhir, A., Nieminen, M., Uses and gratifications of digital photo sharing on Face-book (2016) Telematics and Informatics, 33 (1), pp. 129-138; Nunnally, J., Bernstein, I., (1994) Psychometric Theory 3Rd Edition, , (MacGraw-Hill, New York; Punyanunt-Carter, N.M., de La Cruz, J.J., Wrench, J.S., Investigating the relationships among college students' satisfaction, addiction, needs, communication apprehension, motives, and uses & gratifications with Snapchat (2017) Computers in Human Behavior, 75, pp. 870-875; Rodríguez-Molina, M.A., Frías-Jamilena, D.M., Castañeda-García, J.A., The contribution of website design to the generation of tourist destination image: The moderating effect of involvement (2015) Tourism Management, 47, pp. 303-317; Sánchez, M., Campo, S., Alvarez, M.D., The effect of animosity on the intention to visit tourist destinations (2018) Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, 7, pp. 182-189; Gao, J., Wang, G., Wu, J., Arsenic trioxide inhibits Skp2 expression to increase chemosensitivity to gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells (2019) Am J Transl Res, 11, pp. 991-997; Souiden, N., Ladhari, R., Chiadmi, N.E., Destination personality and destination image (2017) Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, 32, pp. 54-70; Strauss, W., Howe, N., (2000) Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation, p. 29. , New York: Vintage Books; Thai, N.T., Yuksel, U., Too many destinations to visit: Tourists’ dilemma?

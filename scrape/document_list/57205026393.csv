In addition to frequent use of the informal language, the words used are usually less consistent, contain abbreviations, and mixed with local languages. In this study, we combined n-grams feature selection models, i.e., unigrams, bigrams, and unibigram (1 + 2-grams) to analyze the public opinion of the Bahasa Indonesia tweets about the presidential candidates of the Republic of Indonesia in the 2014 presidential election. The experiment was carried out using Naive Bayes classifiers, Maximum Entropy classifiers, and Support Vector Machines with and without stop words removal and stemming in pre-processed tweet documents. The experiment results show the best performance is achieved by Naïve Bayes classifiers with unibigram feature models without removing the stop words and stemming process. This method achieved high performance with the precision and recall up to 85.50% indicating that automatic sentiment analysis of tweet documents using well-known supervised learning methods is feasible for the Indonesian language. More interestingly is the fact that stop words removal and stemming process on the corpus made the classification performances worse compared with the corpus that experienced cleansing only. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data mining; Learning systems; Sentiment analysis; Social aspects; Classification performance; Indonesian languages; Machine learning techniques; Naive Bayes classifiers; Precision and recall; Presidential candidates; Presidential election; Supervised learning methods; Natural language processing systems",,,,,"Zhang, S., Wei, Z., Wang, Y., Liao, T., Sentiment analysis of Chinese micro-blog text based on extended sentiment dictionary (2018) Future Generation Computer Systems, 81, pp. 395-403; Hanafiah, N., Kevin, A., Sutanto, C., Fiona, Arifin, Y., Hartanto, J., Text Normalization Algorithm on Twitter in Complaint Category (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 116, pp. 20-26; Hidayatullah, F., Language tweet characteristics of Indonesian citizens in (2015) 2015 International Conference on Science and Technology (TICST), p. 397. , Pathum Thani; Öztürk, N., Ayvaz, S., Sentiment analysis on Twitter: A text mining approach to the Syrian refugee crisis (2018) Telematics and Informatics, 35 (1), pp. 136-147. , 15; Pang, B., Lee, L., Opinion mining and sentiment analysis (2008) Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval, 2 (1-2), pp. 1-135; Liu, L., Zhang, L., (2014) Mining Text Data, pp. 415-463. , (US: Springer) A survey of opinion mining and sentiment analysis in; Agarwal, Xie, B., Vovsha, I., Rambow, O., Passonneau, R., (2011) Workshop on Language in Social Media, , (Oregon) Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data in; Liu, L., (2012) Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining, 5 (1), p. 1. , (Morgan amp; Claypool Publishers); Barfian, E., Iswanto, B.H., Isa, S.M., Twitter Pornography Multilingual Content Identification Based on Machine Learning (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 116, pp. 129-136; Vidya, N.A., Fanany, M.I., Budi, I., Twitter Sentiment to Analyze Net Brand Reputation of Mobile Phone Providers (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 72, pp. 519-526; Franky, Manurung, R., Machine Learning-based Sentiment Analysis of Automatic Indonesian Translations of English Movie Reviews in (2008) Proceedings of the International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence and Its Applications (ICACIA); Pang, B., Lee, L., Vaithyanathan, S., Thumbs up?: Sentiment classification using machine learning techniques in (2002) Proceedings of Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-2002); Tala, F.Z., (2003) A Study of Stemming Effects on Information Retrieval in Bahasa Indonesia,"" Master of Logic Project, Institute for Logic, Language and Computation, , (Netherlands: Universiteit van Amsterdam); Shuyo, N., (2014) Language Detection Library for Java Retrieved Mei 10, , https://code.google.com/p/language-detection/; Salton, G., Buckley, C., Term-weighted approaches to automatic text retrieval (1988) Information Processing and Management, 24 (5), pp. 513-523; Kuncoro, B.A., Iswanto, B.H., (2015) International Conference on Information Technology Systems and Innovation (ICITSI), , (Bandung) TF-IDF method in ranking keywords of Instagram users' image captions in; Saito, T., Rehmsmeier, M., The Precision-Recall Plot Is More Informative than the ROC Plot When Evaluating Binary Classifiers on Imbalanced Datasets (2015) PLoS ONE, 10 (3); Popovic, M., Willett, P., The effectiveness of stemming from natural-language access to Slovene textual data (1992) J.

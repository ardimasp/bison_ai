The customer is an online transportation network that uses a mobile application and uses a digital wallet of the online transportation network to deposit money into the customer's account as a balance for payment when ordering transportation. The online transportation network is a part of shared economy practice by using mobile applications. This is the quantitative research, and there is a questionnaire to the 336 students, and get the 251 students for valid data. The research question for this article is this: Are students kept safe and comforted by online transportation networks? Will students pay with the digital wallet (to be cashless) for better security and convenience? This research concludes that students can adequately use the sharing economy's technology as well as on an online transportation network equipped with digital wallets, and they get higher value from online transportation network. © 2020 IEEE.","Digital wallet; Higher education student; Mobile application; Online transportation network; Sharing economy technology","E-learning; Electronic money; Information management; Mobile computing; Digital wallets; Higher education students; Mobile applications; Quantitative research; Research questions; Transportation network; Students",,,,,,"Go-Pay Pelanggannya Sempat Hilang, , http://tekno.kompas.com/read/2016/08/30/09310037/Saldo.Go-Pay.Pelanggannya.Sempat.Hilang.Ini.Kata.Go-Jek, Ini Kata "" Go-Jek""-Kompas. com.

Several cases had been reported due to the usage of a fake transcript. One modus of using fake transcript is to enter a higher level of education and job promotion. The new technology found called Blockchain believes in solving the problem. Characteristics of Blockchain Technology such as secured, immutable, distributed, transparent seem to be matched with transcript document requirement. Therefore, the research tries to create a process model of the university teaching and learning process. Several studies have been done; however, no detailed process shown especially for teaching and learning activities. The research question is, how are teaching, and learning activities can be supported by Blockchain Technology? Qualitative method used in this research, focus group discussion with 9 reputable universities discussed the academic operation process and the result show that it is possible to adopt Blockchain Technology into the teaching and learning process to avoid forgery of university transcript documents. © 2020 IEEE.","Blockchain technology; Blockchain technology-based; Teaching and learning process; Transcript","Blockchain; Information management; Teaching; Innovative solutions; Learning Activity; Level of educations; Operation process; Qualitative method; Research questions; Teaching and learning; University teaching; Learning systems",,,,"12/AKM/PNT/2019","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This study is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Implementasi Blockchain Platform Untuk Menciptakan “Good Governance” pada Perguruan Tinggi” or “The Implementation of Blockchain Platform to Create“Good Governance” in Higher Education” with contract number: 12/AKM/PNT/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","Ari, S., (2015) Perguruan Tinggi Harus Waspadai Transkrip Nilai Palsu-Tribun Jogja, , https://jogja.tribunnews.com/2015/01/09/perguruan-tinggi-haruswaspadai-transkrip-nilai-palsu, jogja.

With customer payments, it is usually easier to make payments with mobile payment, because it is more practical and direct than mobile banking. However, is the privacy of both platforms understood by the customer? Research questions to be answered: 1) What are the factors that influence privacy issues in mobile banking? 2) What are the factors that influence privacy issues with mobile payments? 3) What are the factors that influence confidence in mobile banking? 4) What are the factors that influence confidence in mobile payments? 5) Does the privacy factor influence the perceived privacy? 6) Does the confidence factor influence the perceived privacy?

However, to be able to apply the concept, there are three main elements that must be prepared as the basic foundation. These elements are structure, infrastructure, and superstructure. In this study we focused on the problem of the high cost of funding needed to finance these three elements. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the government must create new investment opportunities outside the stock exchange whose impacts can also be directly used for financing programs. In this study, we conducted an investigation of the interest of urban people to invest in online channels. The aim is to determine the decision-making behavior of the Indonesian people in non-consumptive capital expenditure activities when the government creates and publishes financing instruments on the market.

In this point, the transaction raises several new and crucial challenges. At a closer look, the concerns appeared due to no data integration, verification, and validation from parties both inside or outside of the university. In this respect, the data is not centralized or integrated. As this backdrop, this causes repeated data confirmation, and no one can authenticate the data validity when distributed to other parties. In this point of entry, the diploma certification forgery has become one of the significant issues in education in Indonesia. As a framework that enables the data integration, Blockchain contains verified data on every single of a transaction, so the data is trustworthy. With this in mind, this paper aims to discuss the best blockchain model for the university level. This study is qualitative-based research. As a result, McRhys model is introduced as a potential and implementable blockchain model in university in Indonesia. © 2019 IADIS Press.

With the recurring spread of fake news in recent time, it provides opportunities for higher education students to be able to receive and spread the fake news through LINE group. The purpose of this research: first, to show college students' activities and the intention of awareness to receive fake news by users. Second, to measure the number of college student groups with awareness of spread fake news. Third, to investigate whether Higher education students with many groups can make or modify fake news. There are 15 questions using a Likert scale and 5 multiple choice questions which are shown to higher education students and presented by using statistical descriptive explanatory analysis for this research. The result of this research is higher education students have many groups and this does not affect the number of fake news because Higher education students need to do advanced research on the news and see if the news has a reliable source. The number of groups in the LINE mobile application imposes no effect on the spread of fake news. © 2017 IEEE.","Fake News; Groups; Higher education students; LINE; Social Media","Information management; Mobile computing; Social networking (online); Fake News; Groups; Higher education students; LINE; Social media; Students",,,,,,"Penyebar Berita Hoax di Indonesia Bisa Raup Rp700 Jutaan, , https://www.cnnindonesia.com/teknologi/20161202085641185-176767/penyebar-berita-hoax-di-indonesia-bisa-raup-rp700-jutaan/, [Online], [Accessed: 20-Aug-2017]; Kehadiran Hoax Hari Ini Oleh Abel Salsabil-Kompasiana.com, , http://www.kompasiana.com/abelsalsabil/kehadiranhoax-hari-ini_593029294b7a6171097eb915, [Online], [Accessed: 20-Aug-2017]; Hoax Jadi Ladang Bisnis Karena Masyarakat Kurang Kritis, , http://www.beritasatu.com/digital-life/449615-hoax-jadiladang-bisnis-karena-masyarakat-kurang-kritis.html, [Online], [Accessed: 30-Aug-2017]; Awas Hoax!

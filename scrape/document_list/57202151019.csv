Task scheduling is one of the technologies that have been applied to solve those objectivities. However, task scheduling is one of the well-known NP-hard problems, and it is difficult to find the optimum solution. To solve this problem, previous studies have utilized a meta-heuristic method to find the best solution based on the solution spaces. This study aims to compare four meta-heuristic such as the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Clonal Selection Algorithm (CSA), and Bat Algorithm (BA) to solve the multi-objective task scheduling to achieve the optimum solution. This study converts three objectivities into single objectivity optimization with each objectivity act as variable assigned with the weight that presents its priority and has implemented those meta-heuristics. The simulation result from sixteen datasets that have been grouped into three for a small dataset, medium dataset, and large dataset. In small and medium dataset BA able to outperforms others while in large dataset PSO shows better performance. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Websites contain information which is majority in visual presentation. Therefore it is not user-friendly for blind and visually impaired people. Furthermore, the existing web-accessing tools for people with disability require users to be computer literate. Unfortunately not all blind and visually impaired people are computer literate. Based on these facts a new web accessing tool is needed to be developed. This study is done in order to develop this new web-accessing tool that uses Bahasa Indonesia and help blind and visually impaired people in accessing websites even though they have a very low computer literacy. The web-accessing tool should be able to deliver the main information inside the website and can be accessed from public service area without specific additional hardware and software. The web-accessing tool is developed with speech recognition as input, web scraping to get the main content of the website, and text to speech and produce audio as output. The web-accessing tool has been tested using usability evaluation to ensure that the web-accessing tool is usable and easy to use for blind and visually impaired people. The usability testing evaluation showed satisfying results that indicate the tool's usability and easiness to use. © 2017 IEEE.","blind and visually impaired people; speech recognition; text to speech; web-accessing tool","Character recognition; Websites; Blind and visually impaired; Computer literacy; Hardware and software; Information sources; People with disabilities; Text to speech; Usability evaluation; Visual presentation; Speech recognition",,,,,"(2017) Universal Declaration of Human Rights, , http://www.un.org/en/universal-declarationhuman-rights/, United Nations Online; Dorvlo, S.S., Dadzie, P.S., Information literacy among post graduate students of the University of Ghana (2016) Libr.

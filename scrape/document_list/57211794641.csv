Therefore, with this fast-growing market, Fintech Companies need to know their user opinion in Realtime in order to face their competitor on the market. Existing user review on Application Store already existed but there are no classification based on the subject of the review, because it only focus on the application not on the business level, therefore there are in need of a sentiment analysis to classify a user review based on the subject, in this paper we do a sentiment analysis using Naïve Bayes algorithm in Bahasa Indonesia and in English, while also seeing the significance of data cleansing on the data, the resulted accuracy of the test in this paper between the analysis is 78% for English and Bahasa, and 75% for Bahasa Only. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

To achieve its business goals, optimal and integrated information technology will support good quality services. The XYZ University Information System (UIS) provides a variety of information needed by students, lecturers, and all staff. But the system that is running is still experiencing problems in its use that can pose various risks. To prevent that, a risk assessment is carried out on the UIS to identify various possible risks and prevent them by forming a risk management. This research will be conducted using NIST 800-30. This standard is used with the aim of anticipating risks so that the organization does not experience losses. The preparation of UIS information security risk management carried out in this study has succeeded in identifying 32 risk scenarios, prioritizing risks, providing direction in managing risks and accepting processes whether risks are acceptable or should be mitigated. © BEIESP.","Information system risk assessment; NIST 800-30; Risk management; University information system",,,,,,"Mahardika, F., (2017) Manajemen Risiko Keamanan Informasi Menggunakan Framework NIST SP 800-30 Revisi 1, 2 (2), pp. 1-8; Suroso, J.S., Fakhrozi, M.A., Suroso, J.S., Fakhrozi, M.A., ScienceDirect ScienceDirect Assessment Of Information System Risk Management with Octave Assessment Of Information Risk Management with Octave Allegro At System Education (2018) Procedia Comput.

In conducting its business, PT XYZ has been utilizing the information systems such as network infrastructure and applications, however, its usage has not maximized yet, therefore it requires a good information system design. This research aims to generate information system design which can optimize the strategic role of information systems, which is increase the value of information and business enterprise. Research through several stages, namely the study of literature, a common method of determining the strategic planning of information systems, collecting data through observation and interviews, then analyzing internal and external data and business / IT. The results of data analysis will become input for a SWOT analysis (Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities Threats). The strategy that has been obtained through SWOT analysis calculation, then based on such analyzes will generate information systems strategy. The outcome of this research is a recommendation of strategic planning information system applications that will come in. The conclusion from this research that is information systems strategy must be aligned with the business strategy. Therefore, to ensure alignment between information systems strategy with business strategy, we need a good strategic planning of information systems in order to achieve organization goals. © 2016 IEEE.","Enterprise Architecture; Information Systems; Strategic","Ecodesign; Network architecture; Planning; Purchasing; Strategic planning; Systems analysis; Case study approach; Enterprise Architecture; Information systems strategy; Network infrastructure; Planning information; Securities companies; Strategic; Value of information; Information systems",,,,,"Rainer Potter, T., (2003) Introduction to Information System, , Second Edition.

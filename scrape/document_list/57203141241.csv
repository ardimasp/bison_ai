The application is intended to help people with visual limitations or blind people to access Android-based devices so that they can use library resources by using android devices. Design/methodology/approach: The necessary data are collected from journals, articles, books and questionnaires, and similar applications are analyzed. The application design method used is the Scrum method, which consists of Backlog, Sprint and Scrum Meeting. From the operational side of the application, the method used is speech-to-text and text-to-speech. Findings: This application has been tried with some users who have total blindness and low vision, and all provided a good response to this application. From the performance side, the user gives a very satisfied response to this application. While the ease of using the application, the user also provides a satisfactory response to the ease of using this application. Research limitations/implications: The application still has limitations in penetration to the user, and the application is only built using Android as its platform. In addition, the dependence on libraries from Google has caused difficulties in implementing this application with local dialect, which is only understood by the local community. Social implication: This application has implications for the society, especially those with limitations in eyesight can be so much more productive and independent. This can reduce the social burden in society. Originality/value: This application provides an easy access of an android device to blind people and people with low vision, as well as access to library resources with devices that have been installed with this application. This facility can improve the library accessibility to the blind and visually challenged community. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Android; Application; Assistant; Blind; Mobile device; Speech; Text; Voice recognition",,,,,,"Bruegge, B., Dutoit, A.H., (2004) Object-Oriented Software Engineering Using UML, Patterns and Java-(Required) (Vol. 2004), , Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ; Craven, J., (2003) Access to electronic resources by visually impaired people; Epp, M.A., Closing the 95 percent gap: library resource sharing for people with print disabilities (2006) Library Trends, 54 (3), pp. 411-429; Lee, W.M., (2012) Beginning Android 4 Application Development, , John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ; Naone, E., TR10: intelligent software assistant - MIT technology review (2017) MIT Technology Review, , www2.technologyreview.com/news/412191/tr10-intelligent-software-assistant/, (accessed: 27 November 2017; Sutherland, J., Schwaber, K., (2011) The definitive guide to scrum: the rules of the game",,,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,07419058,,,,"English","Libr.

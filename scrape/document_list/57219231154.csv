The bridge is important because it serves as a liaison between two separate places due to several conditions. This research is conducted to find out whether existing bridge can still meet the criteria of stress, deflection, and deformation based on load value factor, load action, and load combination on SNI 1725-2016. The earthquake load used is a response spectrum using SNI 2833: 2013 regulations[1]. This research uses finite element method using software midas civil software program. In this analysis it is found that the value of stress, deflection, and deformation on the bridge structure according to SNI 1725-2016 is greater than RSNI T 02-2005. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Accordingly, the telecom operator must have the ability to improve the quality of services as the number of subscribers increases. One of the systems used by customer care is the prepaid subscribers administration system (SAS). The purpose of this paper was to implement subscribers load balancing that related to users' satisfaction and system performance. The strategy and method that were employed to develop and implement the system as follows: data collection and analysis, preparation (includes dry run process to ensure proper functions), implementation process based on Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) method and enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTom) framework, and ultimately the final test and monitoring phase; the latter done to ensure system performance and user satisfaction. © 2014 IIJ.","eTOM; ITIL; Load balancing; Prepaid system; SAS; Subscribers administration system",,,,,,"Wan, S.H.C., Chan, Y., Improving service management in outsourced IT operations (2007) Journal of Facilities Management, 5 (3), pp. 188-220; Borthick, A.F., Bowen, P.L., Auditing system development: Constructing the meaning of ""systematic and rational"" in the context of legacy code migration for vendor incentives (2008) Journal of Information Systems, 22 (1), pp. 47-62; Hoffman, T., A Telco giant gets agile (2008) Computerworld, 42 (18), pp. 30-31; Alfaraj, H., Qin, S., Deriving software acquisition process from maturity models-an experience report (2010) Journal of Software Engineering and Applications, 3 (3), pp. 280-286; Reyes, A., Second-order auditing practices (2001) Systemic Practice and Action Research, 14 (2), pp. 157-180; Scheepers, H., Scheepers, R., A process-focused decision framework for analyzing the business value potential of IT investments (2008) Information Systems Frontiers, 10 (3), pp. 321-330; Kelly, M.B., Report: The TeleManagement forums enhanced telecom operations map (eTOM).

The workers also can get physical injury risk such as Musculoskeletal Disorder (MSDs). To reduce the risk, it is necessary to analyze the work task through risk assessment to observe the posture during using the equipment such as rig up the Pressure Control Equipment (PCE) to determine the level of risk for each task, and the cumulative risk for each work cycle. This study uses the Postural Ergonomic Risk Assessment (PERA) method to analyze and measuring cyclic assembly work. We set the risk criteria for activity classification (A) into posture, duration, and force which divided into three groups (A<4 = Low risk, 4≤A≤ 7 = Possible risk, A≥7 = High risk). Time duration and stressed posture provide high risk exposure, whereas the workers manually operate and install the component and spare parts can lead to medium and low risk exposures. We found that the high potential risks to cause harm are when the workers operate Tree Adaptor Installation and BOP Installation. Whereas, the Making up Lubricator connection and PCE Secure Line Installation provide medium and low risk exposures, respectively. Our study can be guidance on the steps of prioritization and intervention to reduce the musculoskeletal risks. © IAEME Publication.","Musculoskeletal disorder; PCE; PERA; Risk analysis; Workspace design",,,,,,"Arjmand, N., Amini, M., Adi, A.S., Plamondon, A., Parnianpour, M., Revised NIOSH lifting equation may generate spine loads exceeding recommended limits (2015) International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, pp. 1-8;

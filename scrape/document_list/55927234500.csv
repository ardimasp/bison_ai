Tourists are the main source of income for gross domestic income in Indonesia. However, although Indonesia as a beautiful archipelago country has so much offer to foreign and local tourist, until now it fails to give their potential to the country. Furthermore, the COVID-19 situation made Indonesia tourism worse. Travelling is banned as a consequence of lockdown in Indonesia. Business and economic need to adjust into their new normal. Unfortunately, in the midst of the current era of Internet technology and new normal, Indonesia’s tourism promotion is considered to be uneven and unwell targeted. Many tourist destinations are very interesting and clean but not yet known by potential tourists both from domestic and abroad due to the lack of targeted promotions and re-branding of a safe place to visit. Seeing to this prob-lem, this study aims to propose an integrated tourism system called SONIA, by using a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to build a personalized recommender system. Through this system integration model, a significant socio-economic benefit can be made for tourism sector in Indonesia. The results of the research will be exploited for the tourism industry and Indonesia’s participation in the global tourism competition market. © 2020, ICIC International.

Validity and reliability test, classical assumption tests, goodness of fit test, and SEM were used to analyse the relation between variables. Findings indicated psychological contract had a significant effect on work engagement and turnover intention individually; and that work engagement significantly mediated the relation between psychological contract and turnover intention. Thus, this study contributes to the knowledge of Human Resource Management by pointing to the importance of psychological contract and work engagement to turnover intention.

The reason for looking at ideal board remuneration is that the ideal remuneration should have an impact on the board performance and, in turn, lead to board effectiveness. However, the development of ideal board remuneration in Indonesian state-owned enterprises (SOE) has been based on relatively little research. Considering the relative importance attached by boards to a variety of governance tasks in SOEs, the primary aim of this article is to shed light on the extent of board remuneration impact performance of the board in implementing good corporate governance in Indonesian SOEs. The exploratory nature of this study led to the adoption of a qualitative research methodology that uses semi-structured interviews and publically available documents to collect a range of data pertaining board remuneration and the work of boards. Interviews were conducted with six informants from four Indonesian SOEs and Ministry of SOEs. The findings of this research demonstrate that the current Indonesian SOEs’ board remuneration system is not adequate as well as has a negative impact on the performance of the board. This was due to demotivation of active members and conflict of interest among members of the board, peculiarities to the performance of individual members of the board of commissioners. This study makes a significant contribution to both the board and the corporate governance field by addressing the basic research gaps of board remuneration issues in SOEs. The gap is addressed by providing a more coherent framework for effective board remuneration system that reflects more clearly the real experiences of those involved at the board level. © 2017, © 2017 International Management Institute, New Delhi.","board of commissioners; Board remuneration; good corporate governance; Indonesian stated-owned enterprises",,,,,,,"Abeng, T., (2001) Indonesia, Inc.: Privatizing state-owned enterprises, , Singapore, Times Academic Press; Adams, R.B., Ferreira, D., Gender diversity in the board room (2004) Finance Working Paper, 57, p. 30; Baxi, C., The current context of corporate governance in India (2005) Global Business Review, 6 (2), pp. 303-314; Cadbury, A., (1999) Corporate governance: A framework for implementation, , London, England, The World Bank; (2007) Executive remuneration: Simple, practical, proposal for better practice in reporting executive reward, , London, England, Report Leadership—Tomorrow’s Reporting Today; Clarke, T., The stakeholder corporation: A business philosophy for the information age (2004) Theories of corporate governance: The philosophical foundations of corporate governance, pp. 189-202. , London, England, Routledge Taylor and Francis Group, (Ed.).

Syahdan No. 9, 11480 Jakarta, Indonesia","Corporate governance has been implemented in Indonesian State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) since 2002, however scandals over the SOEs are still occurring until today. Most of these cases happened as a result of weak control by the Board of Commissioners (BoC) against the board of management (BoD) due to unique governance structure in Indonesia. The primary aim of this study is to shed light on the extent of the governance structure impact upon the effectiveness of the BoC in Indonesian SOEs through analysing two factors; power and roles of the BoC. Being exploratory in nature, this study uses qualitative method in order to enhance an understanding of BoC real practices in Indonesian SOEs. Triangulation method is used for data collection, including semi-structured interviews with 19 informants over 8 SOEs. The study indicates that Indonesia governance structure with the two-tier model which followed its own path does not support effectiveness of the BoC in Indonesian SOEs. This is due to peculiarities in parallel position of the BoC to the BoD that have an impact on power of the BoC over the BoD and unclear roles of the BoC. Thus, it may seem that Indonesia has to apply the two-tier structure without any changes. This study aims to fill the gap in the literature by analysing impact Indonesia governance structure to effective BoC through assessing actual views and perceptions from members of the BoC, the BoD and the government as shareholder's representative. It also provides information on corporate governance system in Indonesia which difference with Western countries. © Medwell Journals, 2013.","Good coporate governance; Governance structure; Indonesia; Shareholders; State-owned enterprisese",,,,,,,"Abeng, T., Indonesia Inc.: Privatising State-Owned Enterprises (2001), p. 224. , Times Academic Press, Singapore, ISBN: 978-9812101747; Achmad, T., Corporate governance of family firms and voluntary disclosure: The case of Indonesian manufacturing firms (2007), Ph.D. Thesis, Unviversity of Western Australia, Perth; Barton, D., Coombes, P., Wong, S., Asia's governance challenge (2004) McKinsey Q, 2, pp. 54-61; Berle, A.A., Means, G.C., The Modern Corporation and Private Property (1932), 6th Edn., Transaction Publisher, New Brunswick, French; Bozec, R., Dia, M., Board structure and firm technical efficiency: Evidence from Canadian state-owned enterprises (2007) Eur.

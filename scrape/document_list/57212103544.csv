As the technology advances, visual design communication explore further, paving ways to visualize something that doesn't have the visual attribute; sound, something that can only be perceived through auditory senses. The sound is transformed by controlling symbols, images, color movement into an image, using a visual programming software combined with typography composition, to create GIF (Graphic Interchange Format) as the final product. Sound visualization opens the possibility to experience sounds without even hearing it. It is an experimental tool to experience sound, to give an even deeper meaning of a message, and to bridge the possibilities to convey sound to the hearing impairment, those who carry disability, expanding the minds and horizon so they can experience sound. © 2019 IEEE.","disability; GIF; Sound; typography; visualization","Acoustic waves; Arts computing; Computer programming; Flow visualization; Sustainable development; Typesetting; Visual communication; Visualization; Communication process; disability; Hearing impairments; Interchange formats; Sound visualization; Technology advances; typography; Visual communication designs; Audition",,,,,"Weinschenk, S., (2011) 100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know about People, , New Riders 1249 Eighth Street Berkeley, CA; Brody, J.E., Unlocking the world of sound for deaf children (2018) Nytimes.com, 9. , https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/well/live/unlocking-The-worldof-sound-for-deaf-children.html, Oct.

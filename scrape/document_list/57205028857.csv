The purpose of this paper is to develop a pattern of relations between rice availability and rice consumption so that a balance occurs in the management of rice availability. The method used is the System Dynamics model, where this method is able to formulate a complex system by utilizing historically existing data to form a model, therefore this approach is expected to form a performance model of balance between rice availability and consumption which can then be simulated to predict needs in the future so that it can be used for faster and more accurate decision making. © BEIESP.","Modelsimulation; Rice availability; System dynamics",,,,,,"Junzeng, X., Bai, W., Li, Y., Wang, H., Wei, Z., Modeling rice development and field water balance using AquaCrop model under drying-wetting cycle condition in eastern China (2019) Agricultural Water Management, 213, pp. 289-297; Muhammadi, E.A., Soesilo, B., (2001) Analisa Sistem Dinamis ‘Lingkungan Hidup, , Sosial.

Argumentative sentences are often used in daily communication and have important role in each decision or conclusion making process. The research objective is to do observation in deep learning utilization combined with attention mechanism for argument annotation and analysis. Argument annotation is argument component classification from certain discourse to several classes. Classes include major claim, claim, premise and non-argumentative. Argument analysis points to argumentation characteristics and validity which are arranged into one topic. One of the analysis is about how to assess whether an established argument is categorized as sufficient or not. Dataset used for argument annotation and analysis is 402 persuasive essays. This data is translated into Bahasa Indonesia (mother tongue of Indonesia) to give overview about how it works with specific language other than English. Several deep learning models such as CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) are utilized for argument annotation and analysis while HAN (Hierarchical Attention Network) is utilized only for argument analysis. Attention mechanism is combined with the model as weighted access setter for a better performance. From the whole experiments, combination of deep learning and attention mechanism for argument annotation and analysis arrives in a better result compared with previous research. © 2020, The Author(s).","Argument analysis; Argument annotation; Attention mechanism; Bahasa Indonesia; Deep learning",,,,,"Universitas Indonesia, UI: R3.1/HKP.05.00/2018

The most common practice to deal with online suspects of hate speech is by manually reporting the comment or the post which at the back end is reviewed by a person. This has a lot of limitations. it requires a lot of time as human intervention is required. Many countries have made laws so that companies have to deal with this type of content within a time frame. This systematic literature review examines hate speech detection problem and will be used to do an experimental approach on detecting hate speech and abusive language. This work also provides an overview of previous research, including methods, algorithms, and main features used. We observe 31,633 papers of current research about hate speech detection from online databases, after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria the result is 1,929 papers and then returned 15 papers after the full text analysis. These papers are for answering the research questions of this systematic literature review. We use two research questions in this literature review which will be the foundation of the next experimental research. Correctly classifying a piece of text as an actual hate speech requires a lot of correctly labelled data. Most common challenges are different languages, out of vocabulary words, long range dependencies and many more. © 2020, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

This study uses long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) network to build the generator and evaluator model. First, a midi file is converted into a midi matrix in midi encoding process. Then, each midi is trained on a single layer and double stacked layer model of each network as a generator model. Next, classification model, based on LSTM and GRU, are trained and chosen as an objective evaluator to analyze the performance of each generator model which classify each midi based on its musical era. Subjective evaluation is conducted by an interview with volunteer respondents with various backgrounds such as classical music interest, performance, composer, and digital composer. The result shows that the double stacked layer GRU model perform better to resemble the composer pattern in music with 70% score of recall. Moreover, subjective evaluation shows that the generated music is listenable and interesting with the highest score of 6.85 out of 10 on double stacked layer GRU. © 2020 The Authors.

This behavior in turn reflects the user's personality. In this paper, we experiment to automatically predict user's personality based on Big Five Personality Trait on Twitter. Our focus is towards Indonesian user. Not only word n-gram, Twitter metadata is also used in a certain combination to determine the feature that will be used to predict the personality. Our research also attempts to find optimum setting based on the number of n-gram, classifier, and twitter metadata. Our experiment yields 0.7482 at most on F-Measure. We conclude that among all scenario, twitter metadata is the least impactful feature, while word n-gram impacts the most. © 2019 The Korean Institute of Intelligent Systems.","Big five; Personality prediction; Social media; Twitter",,,,,,,,"Back, M.D., Stopfer, J.M., Vazire, S., Gaddis, S., Schmukle, S.C., Egloff, B., Gosling, S.D., Facebook profiles reflect actual personality, not self-idealization (2010) Psychological Science, 21 (3), pp. 372-374. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797609360756; Wu, Y., Kosinski, M., Stillwell, D., Computer-based personality judgments are more accurate than those made by humans (2015) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 112 (4), pp. 1036-1040. , https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1418680112; Plank, B., Hovy, D., Personality traits on twitter-or-how to get 1, 500 personality tests in a week (2015) Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis, pp. 92-98. , http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/W15-2913, Lisbon, Portugal; Digital 2019: Indonesia, , https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2019-indonesia; Digital in 2018 in Southeast Asia, , https://slideshare.net/wearesocial/digital-in-2018-in-southeast-asia-part-2-southeast-86866464; Digital in 2017: Southeast Asia, , https://www.slideshare.net/wearesocialsg/digital-in-2017-southeast-asia; Digital in 2016, , https://www.slideshare.net/wearesocialsg/digital-in-2016/224; Digital, Social & Mobile in 2015, , https://www.slideshare.net/wearesocialsg/digital-social-mobile-in-2015; Celli, F., Lepri, B., Is big five better than MBTI?

Recent studies of automatically assigning a personal profile to the users of social media have emerged within the last decade as using personality measuring instruments was considered impractical in the online context. Though being a part of a massive amount of activities in social media, only a few studies have reviewed the approach of automatically recognizing the Bahasa Indonesia speaking users. Previous studies indicated that dataset remains a serious limitation in the field of study, where obtaining a large amount of labelled data is expensive and time-consuming. With that in mind, we present a practical and effective approach to utilize the abundance of unlabeled data in a semi-supervised learning setting using the label propagation model. With the highest ROC AUC score of 0.93 as achieved by the Super Learner algorithm, the presented method could be considered as a sensible approach as a means of overcoming the dataset limitation. © 2019 ISSN.","Automatic personality recognition; Bahasa Indonesia; Semi-supervised learning; Super learner; The big five personality model",,,,,,,,"Farnadi, G., Sitaraman, G., Sushmita, S., Celli, F., Kosinski, M., Stillwell, D., Davalos, S., Cock, M.

We applied 2 methods, one for classifying the conversation type and the other for calculating the online grooming percentage. We used neural network to classify the conversation into several classes. As for calculating the percentage, we used analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to find grooming score based on priority score for each class. This research focused more on online conversation that consists of two people and used English as the main language. The results can be used to determine whether the conversation is considered as groom or not. © 2019 ICIC International.","Analytic hierarchy process; Neural network; Online child grooming; Online conversation; Priority score",,,,,,,,"Randhawa, T., Jacobs, S., (2013) Child Grooming: ‘Offending All the Way through from the Start’ – Exploring the Call from Law Reform, , Australia: Child Wise; Saaty, T.L., Decision making with the analytic hierarchy process (2008) Int.

Sorting out all this digital music is a very time-consuming and causes information fatigue. Therefore, it is very useful to develop a music recommender system that can search in the music libraries automatically and suggest suitable songs to users. By using music recommender system, the music provider can predict and then offer the appropriate songs to their users based on the characteristics of the music that has been heard previously. Our research would like to develop a music recommender system that can give recommendations based on similarity of features on audio signal. This study uses convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) for feature extraction and similarity distance to look similarity between features. The results of this study indicate that users prefer recommendations that consider music genres compared to recommendations based solely on similarity. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This created a rising demand on social media marketing. New breakthroughs in the field of artificial intelligence have enabled brand owners to boost social media marketing by knowing their target's demography. This study presents a model to predict gender of social media users based on comments section on Instagram profile by using AdaBoost, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes Classifier combined with a grid search and K- Fold validation. The model was trained with 40,000 comments and managed to get 78.64% on Naive Bayes, 73.41% on XGBoost, 74.56% on AdaBoost and 76.07% on SVM which are generally higher than related studies on this subject. This result shows that Naive Bayes produces higher accuracy on short text classification and has possibilities to help social media marketing. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Current trends in argumentation mining research use handcrafted features and traditional machine learning (e.g., support vector machine). We worked on two tasks: identifying argument components and recognising insufficiently supported arguments. We utilise deep learning approach and implement attention mechanism on top of it to gain the best result. We do also implement Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) in this task. HAN is a neural network that gives attention to two levels, which are word-level and sentence-level. Deep learning with attention mechanism models can achieve better result compared with other deep learning methods. This paper also proves that on research task with hierarchically-structured data, HAN will perform remarkably well. We do present our result on using XGBoost instead of a regular non-ensemble classifier as well.

Parallel schedule generation scheme is used to generate feasible scheduling solutions, while firefly algorithm is used to find optimal solution by updating priority value of each activity. A web-based application is developed to run the scheduling simulation. Scheduling simulation is conducted to determine the optimal parameter values for firefly algorithm and minimum project makespan. The optimal firefly algorithm parameter values are 10 for light absorption coefficient value, 10 for firefly population, 100 for maximal iteration, and 0.8 for random parameter. With 6 structure resources and 12 finishing resources available for construction project, the minimum project makespan value is [110, 142, 167, 224] with fuzzy magnitude value of 213.583. © 2018 The Authors.

Foremost, we discuss Twitter and its utilization as a resource for many types of research. Several previous studies have been attempted to predict users' personality automatically. However, only a few of them have done their research for Bahasa Indonesia data. Therefore, this paper discusses the optimization of APR in Bahasa Indonesia. We evaluate a series of techniques implementing hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and sampling to improve the machine learning algorithms used. The personality prediction system is built on machine learning algorithms. There are three machine learning algorithms used in this study, namely Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and two ensemble learning algorithms, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and stacking (super learner). By implementing this series of optimization techniques, the current study's evaluation results show huge improvement by achieving 1.0 ROC AUC score with SGD and Super Learner. © 2018 The Authors.

There are already several developed NERs dedicated to specific languages such as English, Vietnamese, German, Hindi and many others. However, our research focuses on Indonesian language. Our Indonesian NER is managed to extract the information from articles into 4 different classes; they are Person, Organization, Location, and Event.

This opportunity is due to the abundant amount of information shared by the user. This fact is especially true for countries with high number of active social media users such as Indonesia. Extraction of information from social media can yield insightful results if done correctly. Recent studies have managed to leverage associations between language and personality and build a personality prediction system based on those associations. The current study attempts to build a personality prediction system based on a Twitter user's information for Bahasa Indonesia, the native language of Indonesia. The personality prediction system is built on Support Vector Machine and XGBoost trained with 329 instances (users). Evaluation results using 10-fold cross validation shows that the system managed to reach highest average accuracy of 76.2310% with Support Vector Machine and 97.9962% with XGBoost. © 2017 PTI.",,"Forecasting; Information systems; Support vector machines; 10-fold cross-validation; Amount of information; Automated analysis; Evaluation results; Extraction of information; Native language; Personality predictions; Status updates; Social networking (online)",,,,"Kementerian Riset, Teknologi dan Pendidikan Tinggi

Noise is an unwanted component of the image. The existence of noise in a face image can degrade the accuracy of a face recognition. Therefore, we need a proper method that can cope noise or restore the quality of the image. The best method to overcome noise in the image is to use smoothing (filter). In this research, we discuss some techniques to overcome noise in face recognition task using Gabor and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), as it is stated in the previous research that it still cannot handle images with noise yet. The noises discussed in this research consist of impulse noise (salt-and-pepper), additive noise (Gaussian) and multiplicative noise (speckle). The experiment was conducted by using two face databases; they were ORL and Extended Yale B. The result said that mean filter is the best coping technique for Gabor and NMF face recognition methods. We used K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) as the classifier and it achieved 90.83% accuracy rate. © 2016 IEEE.","face recognition; filter; Gabor; NMF; noise","Additive noise; Factorization; Gabor filters; Impulse noise; Matrix algebra; Nearest neighbor search; Face recognition methods; filter; Gabor; Illumination effect; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Multiplicative noise; noise; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Face recognition",,,,,,,"Olsson, T., Strengthening authentication with biometric technology (2003) GSEC Practical 1.4b, Option, 1. , August 26; Delac, K., Grgic, M., Bartlett, M.S., (2008) Recent Advances in Face Recognition, , Croatia: In-Tech; Purnomo, F., Suhartono, D., Shodiq, M., Susanto, A., Raharja, S., Kurniawan, R.W., Face recognition using Gabor Wavelet and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (2015) SAI Intelligent Systems Conference (IntelliSys), pp. 788-792. , IEEE, November; Rani, V., A brief study of various noise model and filtering techniques (2013) Journal of Global Research in Computer Science, 4 (4), pp. 166-171; Boncelet, C., Image Noise Models (2005) Handbook of Image and Video Processing, , Alan C.

Not all the mistyped words are totally wrong. If they are caused by human errors, we should look further to handle it. Thus, enhanced version of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is proposed. LSA is enhanced by calculating the value of mistyped words before constructing the term document matrix. Essays which are scored consists of 119 English essays of student's writing assignment while several essays as gold standard are made by experts. All of the essays have been scored manually by the human grader. Enhanced LSA gives the closeness level of 0.242 to human judgment, while LSA indicates the closeness level of 0.244 to human judgment. Unfortunately, Enhanced LSA cannot outperform GLSA which is one of current methods. The experiment result indicates that Enhanced LSA by considering mistyped words has a better closeness value to human judgment compared with LSA. © 2016 IEEE.","enhanced LSA; Latent Semantic Analysis; mistyped words; term document matrix","Matrix algebra; Automated essay scoring; Document matrices; enhanced LSA; Gold standards; Human judgments; Latent Semantic Analysis; mistyped words; Writing assignments; Semantics",,,,,,,"Hyland, K., (2004) Disciplinary Discourses: Social Interactions in Academic Writing, , Michigan: The University of Michigan Press; Wild, F., Stahl, C., Stermsek, G., Neumann, G., Parameters Driving Effectiveness of Automated Essay Scoring with LSA (2005) Proceedings of the 9th CAA Conference Loughborough; Dikli, S., Automated Essay Scoring (2006) Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education, 7 (5), pp. 49-62; Dikli, S., An Overview of Automated Scoring of Essays (2006) Journal of Technology, Learning, and Assessment, 5 (1); Landauer, T.K., Foltz, P.W., Laham, D., Introduction to Latent Semantic Analysis (1998) Discourse Processes, 25, pp. 259-284; Islam, M.M., Hoque, S.M.L., Automated Essay Scoring Using Generalized Latent Semantic Analysis (2012) Journal of Computers, 7 (3); Hofmann, T., Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (1999) Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, UAI""99, Stockholm; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 993-1022; Valenti, S., Neri, F., Cucchiarelli, A., An Overview of Current Research on Automated Essay Grading (2003) Journal of Information Technology Education, 2",,,"APTIKOM","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1st International Conference on Informatics and Computing, ICIC 2016","28 October 2016 through 29 October 2016",,127421,,9781509016488,,,"English","Int.

One of the popular algorithms in recommender systems is collaborative filtering. The fundamental assumption behind this algorithm is that other users' opinions can be filtered and accumulated in such a way as to provide a plausible prediction of the target user's preference. In this paper, we would like to develop a recommender system with big data of one e-commerce company and deliver the recommendations through a personalized email. To address this problem, we propose user-based collaboration filter based on company dataset and employ several similarity functions: Euclidean distance, Cosine, Pearson correlation and Tanimoto coefficient. The experimental results show that: (i) user responses are positive to the given recommendations based on user perception survey (ii) Tanimoto coefficient with 10 neighbors shows the best performance in the RMSE, precision and recall evaluation based on groundtruth dataset. © 2016 IEEE.","big data; personalized email; recommender systems; similarity functions; user-based collaborative filtering","Collaborative filtering; Commerce; Correlation methods; Electronic commerce; Electronic mail; Recommender systems; Security of data; Euclidean distance; Ground-truth dataset; Pearson correlation; Precision and recall; Similarity functions; Tanimoto coefficient; User perceptions; User's preferences; Big data",,,,,,,"Stiglitz, K., (2016) 70 Email Marketing Stats Every Marketer Should Know, , https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/emailmarketing/2016/01/70-email-marketing-stats-you-need-to-know/, Accessed July 2016; Hamirani, R., (2016) 5 Stats That Prove Businesses Must Personalize to Win Customers, , http://www.gigya.com/blog/5-stats-that-prove-businesses-must-personalize-to-win-customers/, Accessed 2016; Ekstrand, M.D., Riedl, J.T., Konstan, J.A., Collaborative filtering recommender systems (2010) Foundations and Trends in Human-Computer Interaction, 4 (2), pp. 81-173; Rajaraman, A., Leskovec, J., Ullman, J.D., (2012) Mining of Massive Datasets, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Arsan, T., Köksal, E., Bozkuş, Z., Comparison of collaborative filtering algorithms with various similarity measures for movie recommendation (2016) International Journal of Computer Science, Engineering and Applications (IJCSEA), 6 (3), pp. 1-20; Jannach, D., Zanker, M.F.A., Friedrich, G., (2011) Recommender Systems: An Introduction, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Owen, S., Anil, R., Dunning, T., Friedman, E., (2012) Mahout in Action, , New York: Manning Publications; Kumar, A., Gupta, S., Singh, S.K., Shukla, K.K., Comparison of various metrics used in collaborative filtering for recommendation system (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 Eighth International Conference on Contemporary Computing (IC3), , Noida, India",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 International Workshop on Big Data and Information Security, IWBIS 2016","18 October 2016 through 19 October 2016",,126774,,9781509034772,,,"English","Int.

In this paper, we proposed some new features on top of the state-of-the-art researches in argumentation mining. We grouped 68 features into 8 categories; they are structural, lexical, indicators, contextual, syntactic, prompt similarity, word embedding, and discourse features. Instead of handcrafted features, we utilized word embedding as the feature. At the end of this paper, we presented the comparison between each group of features to classify the argument components. 402 persuasive essays were utilized. We found that structural features were the most significant feature while discourse features were not. After combining all features, we obtained 79.96% as the accuracy; it was slightly outperforming the state-ofthe-art accuracy which was 77.3%. © 2017 CEUR-WS.

This research is based on the point-based summarization technique, where a point is a verb and its syntactic arguments. The point is extracted based on the dependency parse and the syntactic frame. Our proposed system implements the system in three different modules: point extraction, point curation, and summary generation. The system also includes the stance of statement to improve performance of the summarizer. We use ROUGE metrics to evaluate this system. The results of this research are our proposed system performs the best in terms of precision and gets the best f-score after the summaries are preprocessed. The proposed system increases the ROUGE-1 score by 8.99% compared to the point-based summarization and produces 15.84% increase compared to the baseline summarization system. © 2017 The Authors.

Previously, humanoid robot focused on the architecture of body and ethical issues, but later, it is predicted that humanoid robots should consider teaching behaviour, student's interest and speech understanding. They are expected to conclude the answer through conversation under noisy environment. We propose speech recognition systems based on Google translator and basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as stemming and tokenization. We do teach modules for elementary school in order that the robot can interact with students naturally based on psychological aspects. We also discuss about our recent humanoid robot for education in elementary school that has ability to detect user's face and accepts commands in sentences from the user to do any actions such as giving tutorial and answering questions. The average accuracy for correct recognition is 73.3% and correct answer is 63.3%. Our speech recognition system is more promising compared with NAO robot. © 2017 The Authors.

Traditional personality assessments are done by having individuals participate in personality tests. There are several weaknesses to this approach, namely that it is time consuming, and test participants could have made up their answers. A new approach of personality prediction is explored by merely evaluating the contents of a user's social media account.

This task is intended to analyze the presence of a support relation between two sentences. To be able to identify relations between two sentences or arguments, one is obliged to understand the nuance brought by both sentences. Our models are modification of siamese network architectures, in which we replace the feature extractor into Long Short Term Memory and implement cosine distance as the energy function. Our models take a pair of sentences as their input and try to identify whether there is a support relation between those two sentences or not.The primary motivation of this research is to prove that a high degree of similarity between two sentences correlates to sentences supporting each other. This work will focus more on the modification of siamese network and the implementation of attention mechanism. Due to the difference in dataset setting, we cannot arbitrarily compare our results with the prior research results. Therefore, this work will not highlight the comparison between deep learning and traditional machine learning algorithm per se, but it will be more of an exploratory research. Our models are able to outperform the baseline score of accuracy with a margin of 17.33% (67.33%). By surpassing the baseline performance, we believe that our work can be a stepping stone for deep learning implementation in argumentation mining field. © 2017 The Authors.

Besides HAN + XGBoost, we performed experiments with several other deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), bidirectional LSTM, and bidirectional GRU. All results with the best hyper-parameters are presented. In this paper, we present the following three key findings: (1) Shallow models work significantly better than the deep models when using only a small dataset. (2) Attention mechanism can improve the deep model’s result. In average, it improves Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC-AUC) score of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with a margin of 18.94%. The hierarchical attention network gave a higher ROC-AUC score by 2.25% in comparison to the non-hierarchical one. (3) The use of XGBoost as the replacement for the last fully connected layer improved the F1 macro score by 5.26%. Overall our best setting achieves 1.88% improvement compared to the state-of-the-art result. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Deep learning; Hierarchical Attention Network; Insufficiently supported argument; Shallow learning; XGBoost","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Recurrent neural networks; Attention mechanisms; Empirical analysis; Gradient boosting; Insufficiently supported argument; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Shallow learning; XGBoost; Long short-term memory",,,,"039A/VR","Acknowledgments.

There are several criteria of good writing, two of them are cohesion and coherence. Research of cohesion and coherence writing has been conducted by using Centering Theory and Entity Transition Value method. However, the result can still be improved. Therefore, in this research, we tried to use Thematic Development approach which focused on the use of Theme and Rheme as a method to analyze coherence level of a paragraph, combined with CogNIAC rules and Centering Theory to analyze its cohesion. Besides improving the result of previous methods, this research aims to help users in evaluating and assessing their writing text. To achieve these objectives, the proposed method is compared to previous works as well as human judge. Based on the experiment, the proposed method yields average result of 91% which is nearly equivalent to human judge which is 92%. Thematic Development also yields better result compared to Centering Theory which is 29% and Entity Transition Value which is 0%, given the same data set of beginner and intermediate simple writing. © 2016 IEEE.","coherence; cohesion; english paragraph; thematic development","Coherent light; Centering theories; cohesion; Data set; Development approach; english paragraph; thematic development; Transition values; Adhesion",,,,,,,"Rustipa, K., Theme-rheme organization of learners' texts (2010) Dinamika Bahasa Dan Ilmu Budaya, 4 (2); Mitkov, R., Clark, A., Fox, C., Lappin, S., Discourse Processing (2010) The Handbook of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing, pp. 599-611. , West Sussex: Wlley-Blackwell; Not, E., (1996) Implementation of the Thematic Progression and Realization Component, pp. 09-062. , LRE Project; Miltsakaki, E., Kukich, K., Evaluation of text coherence for electronic essay scoring (2004) Natural Language Engineering, 10, p. 44; Tofiloski, M., (2009) Extending Centering Theory for the Measure of Entity Coherence, , Canadian AI.

This fish has become one of the profitable business opportunities for fish farmers, mainly for export to overseas because the price is quite expensive. However, Discus fish is difficult to maintain since it is susceptible to various diseases. An expert system application utilizing fuzzy logic is presented to resolve this problem by diagnosing diseases of the discus fish. It is expected to help beginner fish farmers to detect the disease in the earliest time. Besides diagnosing, this desktop-based application can be exploited to get more information about the diseases in order to prevent and treat the Discus fish.

To incorporate the syntactic information, Syntactically Enhanced LSA (SELSA) is used, whilst Stanford CoreNLP Natural Language Processing Toolkit is used for the Coreference Resolution. To evaluate the results, we calculate the average absolute difference between the system score and human score for each essay. Based on the results, we can conclude that syntactic information, when combined with Coreference Resolution, do not have higher correlation to human score than LSA (an average absolute difference of 0.15748 as opposed to LSA's 0.12597). But interestingly, the two techniques work better when they are used together, rather than when they are used separately. We also develop a new algorithm to calculate the scores, with a better average absolute difference, which is as high as 0.08969.","Automated essay scoring; Coreference resolution; Syntactically enhanced latent semantic analysis; Word order","Automation; Semantics; Syntactics; Absolute difference; Automated essay scoring; Co-reference resolutions; Latent Semantic Analysis; NAtural language processing; Stanford; Syntactic information; Word orders; Natural language processing systems",,,,,,,"Landauer, T.K., Foltz, P.W., Laham, D., Introduction to latent semantic analysis (1998) Discourse Processes, 25, pp. 259-284; Kanejiya, D., Kumar, A., Prasad, S., Automatic evaluation of students' answers using syntactically enhanced LSA (2003) Proceedings of the HLT-NAACL 03 Workshop on Building Educational Applications Using Natural Language Processing, 2, pp. 53-60; Miller, T., Essay assessment with latent semantic analysis (2003) Journal of Educational Computing Research, 29 (4), pp. 495-512; Foltz, P.W., Laham, D., Landauer, T.K., Automated essay scoring: Applications to educational technology (1999) Proc. of the ED-MEDIA'99 Conference, , Charlottesville.

There are many methods which have been developed to get these unique features, such as PCA, LDA, ICA and hybrid methods like ICA and SVM, Gabor and ICA and many others. This research develops a hybrid method from Gabor Wavelet and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) because during conducting literature reviews, the combination of these methods has never been found. The objective of this research is to create face recognition method with a better accuracy than the previous methods.

This method includes three main concepts, the concepts of fuzzy, time series and Markov chain. Fuzzy concepts are useful to classify variables, time series concept to observe the JCI movement during a particular period and Markov chain concept is used in process prediction of JCI values using the transition probability matrix. To assist the analysis of predictions, we design a web-based application that aims to predict by analyzing a JCI data set closing price on a certain period, so that the process can be more efficient, thorough and practical. We compare the accuracy of FTMC and prediction powered from Song and Chissom. The resulting value is quite accurate and can assist users in making decisions relating to the exercise of economic activity. © 2015 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.","Fuzzy time series model; JCI; Markov chain; Web",,,,,,,,"Arumugam, P., Anithakumari, V., Fuzzy time series method for forecasting Taiwan export data (2013) Inter.

Therefore, it is a must to manage the documents. Automatic text summarization is able to solve by producing text document summaries. The goal of the research is to produce a tool to summarize documents in Bahasa: Indonesian Language. It is aimed to satisfy the user’s need of relevant and consistent summaries. The algorithm is based on sentence features scoring by using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Genetic Algorithm for determining sentence feature weights. It is evaluated by calculating summarization speed, precision, recall, F-measure, and some subjective evaluations.

Those documents exist not only in a paper based but also in an electronic based. It can be seen from the data sample taken by the SpringerLink publisher in 2010, which showed an increase in the number of digital document collections from 2003 to mid of 2010. Then, how to manage them well becomes an important need. This paper describes a new method in managing documents called as inverted files system. Related with the electronic based document, the inverted files system will closely used in term of its usage to document so that it can be searched over the Internet using the Search Engine. It can improve document search mechanism and document save mechanism. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,,,"Moore, W., Maccreery, N., Marlow, M., (2010) Usage Measurements for Digital Content, , SpringerLink; Baeza-Yates, R., Ribeiro-Neto, B., (1999) Modern Information Retrieval, , Addison Wesley, USA; Neve, G., Orio, N., (2004) Indexing and Retrieval of Music Documents Through Pattern Analysis and Data Fusion Techniques, , Universitat Pompeu Fabra; Liddy, E., (2005) Document Retrieval, Automatic, Encyclopedia of Language & Linguistics; Lu, G., (1999) Multimedia Management Database Systems, , Artech House Inc., Boston, London; Carmel, D., Cohen, D., Fagin, R., Frachi, E., Herscovici, M., Maarek, Y.S., Soffer, A., Static index pruning for information retrieval systems (2001) Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 43-50. , New Orleans, LA; Garcia, S., Williams, H.E., Cannane, A., Estivill-Castro, V., Access-ordered indexes (2004) Proceedings of the Australasian Computer Science Conference, pp. 7-14. , Dunedin, New Zealand., Ed.

Originally, predictive text system was intended for people who have flaws in verbal and motor. This system is aimed to all people who demands speed and accuracy in typing a document. There were many similar researches which develop this system that had their own strengths and weaknesses. This research attempts to develop the algorithm for predictive text system by combining four methods from previous researches and focus only in Bahasa (Indonesian language). The four methods consist of frequency, n-gram, probability table, and syntactic using grammar. Frequency method is used to rank words based on how many times the words were typed. Probability table is a table designed for storing data such as predefined phrases and trained data. N-gram is used to train data so that it is able to predict the next word based on previous word. And syntactic using grammar will predict the next word based on syntactic relationship between previous word and next word. By using this combination, user can reduce the keystroke up to 59% in which the average keystrokes saving is about 50%.","Keystrokes saving; KSPC; N-gram; Prediction; Predictive text; Word prediction","Artificial intelligence; Forecasting; Syntactics; Keystrokes saving; KSPC; N-grams; Predictive text; Word prediction; Computational linguistics",,,,,,,"Ganslandt, S., Jorwall, J., Nugues, P., Predictive text entry using syntax and semantics (2009) Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Parsing Technologies (IWPT).

They are retrieval failure, interference failure to store and motivated forgetting. So, it is considered to have tools in order to prevent those. This happens almost everywhere, including when the drivers forgot where their car has been parked. Furthermore, the increase of parking fee is also considerable. The purpose of this research is to design a prototype system for mobile web as one of the helpful tools for car parking location reminder using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology that implemented at the parking building. The research is conducted by direct observation of the current system, do a comparison of similar applications, design the architecture of the system, make the programs, create a mock-up and mobile web as a prototype. The result of this research is a prototype of parking location reminder using RFID-based on mobile web. The mobile web displays information menu such as the location and the parking information. Based on the research, it is concluded that the mobile web can be used as one of solutions for parking location reminder and allows users to view information such as the parking duration and the parking fee estimation. © 2013 Science Publications.","Mobile web; Parking building; Prototype; RFID; System",,,,,,,,"Kianpisheh, A., Mustaffa, N., Limtrairut, P., Keikhosrokiani, P., Smart Parking System (SPS) architecture using ultrasonic detector (2012) Int.

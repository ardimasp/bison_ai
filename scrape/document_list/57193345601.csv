One of them is by providing an experience of staying with the villagers (homestay). However, the demands of tourists for homestay facilities will affect the behavior and habits of the village community. How the adaptability of both parties changes the current behavior and lifestyle so that it can impact the design of facilities. The purpose of this paper is to identify the changes in behavior and lifestyle of both parties to initiate the design of tourist facilities in the homestay to meet the requirements of tourist attractions. The theories, a survey, and observation conducted were supported by literature reviews with a particular focus on existing facilities in the homestay. The study results have shown that behavioral and lifestyle adaptations from both parties make a positive contribution to initiate a proper design in a homestay by tourist standard. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Behavioral research; Behavioral changes; Current behaviors; Literature reviews; Proper design; Tourist attractions; Rural areas",,,,,,"Lynch, P., The Commercial Home enterprise and host: A United Kingdon perspective (2005) International Journal of Hospitality, 24 (4), pp. 533-553; Cohen, E., Primitive and remote: Hill trekking in Thailand (1989) Annals of Tourism Research, 16 (1), pp. 30-61; Gu, M., Wong, P.P., Residents' perception of tourism impacts: A case study of homestay operators in Dachangshan Dao, North-East China (2006) Tourism Geo Graphies, 8 (3), pp. 253-273; Othman, F., Sazali, F., Mohammed, B., Rural and community-based tourism development in Malaysia: Prospects for homestays as a social economy enterprise (2013) TEAM Journal of Hospitality Tourism, 10, pp. 65-76; Dolezal, Community-based tourism in Thailand: (Dis-)illusions of authenticity and the necessity for dynamic concepts of culture and power (2011) SEAS: Austrian Journal of South-East Asian Studies, 4, pp. 129-138; Kimaiga, R.K., Kihima, B.O., Pepela, A.W., The role of homestay operators knowledge and skills in enhancing their business (2015) Journal of Tourism Research & Hospitality, 4 (2), pp. 2-11; Susanti, R., (2016) Kopi Gunung Puntang Dari Jawa Barat Juarai Kontes SCAA di Atlanta, , https://regional.kompas.com/read/2016/04/22/07100011/kopi.Gunung.Puntang.dari.Jawa.Barat.Juarai.Kontes.SCAA.di.Atlanta.AS, AS.

The nostalgic reasons is refer to a feeling or inspiring nostalgia [2]. The architecture and interior elements are among that create the nostalgic reasons of one place. Using mixed methodology between qualitative and quantitative, this research aims to overview the architecture, interior and some famous food that people remember about Metropole XXI building in Jakarta. The research found that some architecture and interior elements are among of what people remember about Metropole XXI as nostalgic reason that could help for future research on preserving this building as one of the oldest and well maintain historical building in Jakarta. The research also found that the nostalgic reason would lead to sustainable design for architecture and interior works because of its strong bond to the people who has their emotional closeness. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","architecture preservation; historical architecture; Metropole XXI; nostalgic element; sustainable reason","Architecture; Sustainable development; Historical architectures; Historical buildings; Interior works; Jakarta; Metropole XXI; nostalgic element; Old buildings; sustainable reason; Historic preservation",,,,"Binus University","The authors gratefully acknowledge that the present journal is supported by Bina Nusantara University under Hibah Binus 2019.","Schroder, N.V., Robert, A.W., Tom, C., (2019) Future Worth Preserving; Cojocaru, O., (2019) Infused Nostalgia: Places, Non-places and Places of Memory, , www.academia.edu, Academia.edu.

However, even though it a sustainable resource, many people considered Bamboo as outcast material for furniture because of its appearance. Evidently, the use of bamboo is often used to make simple tools with similar traditional designs for everyday life. The tradition of using bamboo was not further explored with respect to the ongoing development of creative design and function in the era of today's modern technology. In retrospect to the above issues, this study is aimed to introduce the used of bamboo for material furniture in disaster and remote areas in Indonesia to increases their quality of life. It uses a research by a method of collecting data through surveys, literature review, interviews and training to determine the types of bamboo used for material furniture in disaster and remote territories.

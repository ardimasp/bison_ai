At the same time, it was necessary to determine the brand equity elements (brand loyalty, brand image, and perceived quality) and the effect of the marketing mix on brand equity in higher education that implement e-learning, particularly in BINUS Online Learning Jakarta. In order to address the notion, a quantitative approach based on Associative Descriptive Method was adopted. The data collection involved questionnaire instrument to 116 college students of BINUS Online Learning as the target population by undertaking simple random sampling. On that basis, data analysis, using Partial Least Square (PLS), explored SEM-analysis techniques. Evidence derived from the study showed that elements of people, process, and product typified powerful elements of the marketing mix variable.

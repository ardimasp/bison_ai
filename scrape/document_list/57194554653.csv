However, how digital (tech) startups as the initiator performs business model innovation that consciously or not disrupts incumbents from various industries, has not yet been widely analyzed empirically. This study employed a quantitative method with Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS 3 software to present and analyze the data. The sample of Indonesia digital startups was taken from the list managed by DailySocial, an Indonesia digital media startup. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed among the Founders and or C-Level of Indonesia startups adopting a random sampling technique. The findings of this study showed that startups apply disruptive business model innovation to survive and scale-up. This study also suggested some predictors of disruptive business model innovation. As an alternative to implementing dynamic capabilities, startups need to have transformation capability in the form of continuous reconfiguration capability; leadership aspects, especially entrepreneurship mentality, which are embodied in strategic orientation; and stakeholder management support. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Continuous reconfiguration capability; Disruptive business model innovation; Stakeholder management; Startups; Strategic orientation",,,,,"Binus University","We would like to express our gratitude to all parties who helped this study.

The views that arise are views that come from various backgrounds of shareholder members and property stakeholders who are in the circle of residential property supply chain, including property owners and everyone who becomes working and in touch with the property business itself. The data obtained from qualitative and quantitative research give a lot of understanding and input to see the role of CSR and the relation of the performance of property company organization in Indonesia which is generally incorporated in Real Estate Indonesia membership (REI). Property firms provide data representing owners and supply chain properties with careful observation of the company’s CSR activities. The fundamental findings found by the researcher is the existence of adequate understanding level of CSR, and still the scarcity of CSR program organizing in the property company that researched causing CSR in the property industry has not got big impact when compared with CSR done in other industries such as mine, oil and gas. In the future, the contribution of CSR is expected to be greater and more effective and have an impact in building the property especially the housing that can be reached by the wider community including informal sector along with the financing scheme which is not convoluted and can fulfill the backlog of public housing which is getting bigger from year to year. © 2019 IJSTR.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Housing; Informal sector; Organizational performance; Property; Shareholder; Stakeholder; Supply chain",,,,,,,"Pérez, A., Del Rodríguez Bosque, I., Salazar, J., Husted, B.W., Biehl, M., (2012) Measuring CSR Image: Three Studies to Develop and to Validate a Reliable Measurement Tool., , Journal citation; Salazar, J., Husted, B.W., Biehl, M., (2012) Thoughts on the Evaluation of Corporate Social Performance Through Projects., , Journal citation; Drucker, P.F., (2001) Management Challenges for the 21st Century, , Harper Business, New York, USA.

The harsh competition among English course providers and the existence of national plus and international schools have become challenges for the courses to attract students. We use both qualitative and quantitative methods to uncover and respond to the problems faced by this industry. We did interviews with some managers and utilized questionnaires of 61 English courses in DKI Jakarta. Using SMART-PLS (Partial Least Square), we found that the essential entrepreneurial factors of leadership, mindset and entrepreneurial culture as a whole were capable of generating and developing innovations within the English courses, which led to competitive advantages. However, we found an interesting fact that entrepreneurial culture had no direct significant effect on innovations. The novelty of this study is to contribute a new finding that the three elements of strategic entrepreneurship contributed differently to innovation in the context of emerging economies. © 2019 IJSTR.","English courses in DKI jakarta; Entrepreneurial culture; Entrepreneurial leadership; Entrepreneurial mindset; Innovation",,,,,,,"Al Mazrouei, H., Pech, R.J., The expatriate as company leader in the UAE: Cultural adaptation (2015) Journal of Business Strategy, 36 (1), pp. 33-40; Caesar, L.A.Y., Performance excellence by transformational leadership in developing collectivistic culture for Indonesian companies (2016) Pertanika J.

In order to survive, an SME firm must become ambidextrous, with the capability to manage the paradox in learning, innovation, and transformation in their limited condition, so that they can become more competitive and offer products or services that meet the market demand. To become ambidextrous, a company needs many resources. One way to acquire resources is through alliances. This study models the relationship between alliances formation and firm competitiveness as mediated by organizational ambidexterity using partial-leased squares modelling using data from 137 startups in Indonesia. The results showed that organizational ambidexterity has a full mediation effect in the relationship between alliances formation and firm competitiveness. This study argues that the choice of an appropriate partner that is manifested in the Alliances Formation has the main purpose to enable the start-up company to acquire resources to manage the paradox of management in learning, innovation, and decision for transformation. This ability will make them competitive and can design, produce, and market its products superior to those of its competitors. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

The method of collecting data uses a questionnaire distributed to 100 residents of South Jakarta. The data analysis method used in this study is multiple regression analysis using the SPSS application. The sampling technique is probability sampling techniques - simple random sampling. The statistics center of DKI Jakarta Province on January 30, 2017 noted that residents of South Jakarta who had used online transportation services were 2,185,711. Then determining the size and number of samples using Slovin technique sampling with 10% margin error, so that the number of samples to be examined is as much as 99,995 rounded up to 100 samples. Partially, the variable quality of service dominates its influence on repurchase intention variables with t arithmetic 5.201, while t count e-marketing variable is 1.436. T count e-marketing is smaller than t table 1.984. So, it can be concluded that service quality has a significant effect on repurchase intention while e-marketing does not have a significant effect on repurchase intention. © 2019 IEEE.","e-Marketing; repurchase intention; service quality","Commerce; Information management; Marketing; Regression analysis; Data analysis methods; E-marketing; Multiple regression analysis; Probability sampling; Repurchase intention; Service Quality; Simple random sampling; Transportation services; Quality of service",,,,,,"(2017) Traffic Scorecard, , http://inrix.com/scorecard/; Kahraman, C., Yazici, I., Karasan, A., Digital marketing and consumer engagement: Concepts, methodologies, tools, and applications (2018) Hershey: IGI Global; Prasetyo, H.D., Purbawati, D., Pengaruh e-service quality dan e-security seals terhadap e-satisfaction melalui keputusan pembelian konsumen e-commerce (studi kasus pada konsumen lazada Indonesia) (2016) Jurnal Administrasi Bisnis, 5, pp. 127-134; Argote, L., Ingram, P., Knowledge transfer: A basis for competitive advantage in firms (2000) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 82 (1), pp. 150-169; Hutter, K., Hautz, J., Dennhardt, S., Fuller, J., The impact of user interactions in social media on brand awareness and purchase intention: The case of mini on facebook (2013) Journal Product & Brand Management, pp. 342-351; Yoo, C.W., Kim, Y.J., Sanders, G.L., The impact of interactivity of electronic word of mouth systems and e-quality on decision support: In the context of e-marketplace (2015) Information and Management, pp. 1-32; Royle, J., Laing, A., The digital marketing skills gap: Developing a digital marketer model for the communication industries (2014) International Journal of Information Management, pp. 65-73; Al-Weshah, G., E-marketing practices from jordanian tourism agencies perspectives: A qualitative evidence (2018) International Journal of Online Marketing, pp. 21-36; Saghier, N.E., Nathan, D., Service quality dimensions and customers satisfactions of banks in Egypt (2013) Proceedings of 20th International Business Research Conference, pp. 1-13; Pena, M.M., Melleiro, M.M., Batalha, E.M., The use of the quality model of parasuraman, zeithaml and berry in health services (2013) Revista da Escola de Enfermagem da USP, pp. 1227-1232; Al-Tit, A.A., The effect of service and food quality on customer satisfaction and hence customer retention (2015) Asian Social Science, 11, pp. 129-139; Prasetya, F.N., So, I.G., Pengaruh e-marketing dan ecrm terhadap e-loyalty website usaha komunikasi pemasaran (2014) Jurnal Binus Business Review, pp. 8-17; Soebagyo, T., Subagio, H., Analisa pengaruh store image terhadap purchase intention di toserba ramai ngawi (2014) Jurnal Manajemen Pemasaran, 1, pp. 1-9; Ireland, R.D., Hitt, M.A., Sirmon, D.G., A model of strategic entrepreneurship: The construct and its dimensions (2003) Journal of Management, 29 (6), pp. 963-989; Rekettye, G., Rekettye, G., Jr., Global trends and their influence on future business performance (2013) International Journal of Business Performance Management, 14 (1), pp. 95-110",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","4th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2019","19 August 2019 through 20 August 2019",,152147,,9781728133331,,,"English","Proc.

The methodology includes an empirical study that was conducted in education franchising in Indonesia. The results show that the quality of relational relation is important in improving franchisee performance results. Meanwhile, entrepreneur orientation as a moderator variable gives an effect towards the improvement of franchisee performance. From the four indicators of entrepreneur orientation, in education franchise context in Indonesia, the most required indicator is the courage to take risks. This quality is required by franchisee in increasing franchisee performance because without courage to try new things and find creative ideas, franchisee performance will not improve. This article also discusses managerial implications, research limitation and future research. © 2017, © 2017 International Management Institute, New Delhi.","Franchise; Indonesia; performance",,,,,,,"Abdullah, F., Measuring and managing franchisee satisfaction: A study of academic franchising (2008) Journal of Modelling in Management, 3 (2), pp. 182-199; Bagozzi, R.P., Marketing as exchange (1975) Journal of Marketing, 39 (4), pp. 32-39; Baucus, D.A., Baucus, M.S., Human, S.E., Consensus in franchise organizations: A cooperative arrangement among entrepreneurs (1996) Journal of Business Venturing, 11 (5), pp. 359-378; Blau, P., (1964) Exchange and power in social life, , New York, John Wiley and Sons Inc; Brookes, M., Altinay, L., Franchise partner selection: Perspective of franchisors and franchisees (2011) Journal of Service Marketing, 25 (5), pp. 336-348; Campbell, D., Datar, S.M., Sandino, T., Organizational design and control across multiple markets: The case of franchising in the convenience store industry (2009) The Accounting Review, 84 (6), pp. 1749-1779; Castrogiovanni, G.J., Justis, R.T., Strategic and contextual influences on firm growth: An empirical study of franchisors (2002) Journal of Small Business Management, 40 (2), pp. 98-109; Chiou, J.S., Hsieh, C.H., Yang, C.H., The effect of franchisors’ communication, service assistance, and competitive advantage on franchisee’s intentions to remain in the franchise system (2004) Journal of Small Business Management, 42 (1), pp. 19-36; Choo, S., Bowley, C., Using training and development to affect job satisfaction within franchising (2007) Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, 14 (2), pp. 339-352; Clarkin, J.E., Rosa, P.J., Entrepreneurial teams within franchise firms (2005) International Small Business Journal, 23 (3), pp. 303-334; Coulthard, M., The role of entrepreneurial orientation on firm performance and the potential influence of relational dynamism (2007) Journal of Global Business and Technology, 3 (1), pp. 29-42; Covin, J.G., Slevin, D.P., Strategic management of small firm in hostile and benign environment (1989) Strategic Management Journal, 10 (1), pp. 75-87; Croonen, E., Trust and fairness during strategic change processes in franchise systems (2010) Journal of Business Ethics, 95 (2), pp. 191-209; Cropanzano, R., Mitchell, M.S., Social exchange theory: An interdisciplinary review (2005) Journal of Management, 31 (6), pp. 874-900; Dant, P.R., Grunhagen, M., Windsperger, J., Franchising research frontiers for the twenty-first century (2011) Journal of Retailing, 87 (3), pp. 253-268; Das, T.K., Teng, B.S., Alliance constellations: A social exchange perspective (2002) Academy of Management Review, 27 (3), pp. 445-456; Dillman, D.A., (2009) Internet, mail and mixed-mode surveys, , 3rd, New Jersey, NJ, John Willey & Sons, ed.); Doherty, A.M., Market and partner selection processes in international retail franchising (2009) Journal of Business Research, 62 (5), pp. 528-534; Dwyer, F.R., Developing buyer-seller relationships (1987) Journal of Marketing, 51 (2), pp. 11-27; Eisenhardt, K.M., Agency theory: An assessment and review (1989) Academy of Management Review, 14 (1), pp. 57-74; Felstead, A., The social organization of the franchise: A case of controlled self-employment (1993) Journal Work Employment and Society, 5 (1), pp. 37-57; Fornell, C., A second generation of multivariate analysis: Classification of methods and implications for marketing research (1987) Review of marketing, pp. 407-450. , Houston, (ed), Chicago, American Marketing Association,.

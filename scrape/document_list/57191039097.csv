In Southeast Asia, Indonesia contributes up to 50% of the e-commerce transactions. During 2016-2017, e-commerce users in the nation increased by 11%. In the past two years, some data suggested that men had done more shopping through e-commerce than women. To understand the issue, we adopt the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model. This model contains seven independent variables, namely, Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Facilitating Condition, Hedonistic Motivation, Price Value, and Habit. The dependent variable is the Behavioral Intention. The model also has three moderating variables, namely, Gender, Age, and Experience. Questionnaires collect the relevant data from a random sample of 218 respondents. Then, the data are used to establish the relationships between the independent and dependent variables statistically, taking into account the Gender as the moderating variable. The findings are of the following. The adopted model of UTAUT2 matches the data at the fitness level of 0.629 in the term of the coefficient determination R2. The statistical analysis supports the conjectures that Behavioral Intention is affected by Performance Expectancy with the statistical significance of t-stat of 3.118 (associated to p-value of 0.002), by Effort Expectancy with t-stat of 3.117 (0.002), by the Price Value with t-stat of 2.358 (0.019), and Habit with t-stat of 12.626 (0.000). The statistics do not support the conjectures that Behavioral Intention is affected by Social Influence, Facilitating Conditions, and Hedonistic Motivation. No evidence about the roles of Gender on the above relationships is found. © 2019 ICIC International.","Behavioral Intention; E-commerce; Gender; Indonesia; UTAUT2",,,,,,,"Hwang, Y., The moderating effects of gender on e-commerce systems adoption factors: An empirical investigation (2010) Computers in Human Behavior, 26 (6), pp. 1753-1760; Lin, X., Featherman, M., Brooks, S.L., Hajli, N., Exploring gender differences in online consumer purchase decision making: An online product presentation perspective (2018) Information Systems Frontiers, pp. 1-15; Cho, H., Jialin, S.K., Influence of gender on internet commerce: An explorative study in Singapore (2008) Journal of Internet Commerce, 7 (1), pp. 95-119; Bae, S., Lee, T., Gender differences in consumers’ perception of online consumer reviews (2011) Electronic Commerce Research, 11 (2), pp. 201-214; Rodgers, S., Harris, M.A., Gender and e-commerce: An exploratory study (2003) Journal of Advertising Research, 43 (3), pp. 322-329; Slyke, C.V., Bélanger, F., Johnson, R.D., Hightower, R., Gender-based differences in consumer e-commerce adoption (2010) Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 26 (1), p. 2; Zhang, K.Z., Cheung, C.M., Lee, M.K., Examining the moderating effect of inconsistent reviews and its gender differences on consumers online shopping decision (2014) International Journal of Information Management, 34 (2), pp. 89-98; Venkatesh, V., Thong, J.Y., Xu, X., Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology: A synthesis and the road ahead (2016) Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 17 (5), pp. 328-376; Faqih, K.M., An empirical analysis of factors predicting the behavioral intention to adopt internet shopping technology among non-shoppers in a developing country context: Does gender matter?

Therefore this study aims to analyze with a systematic and empirical approach of the social media usage (Including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) by DKI Jakarta governor candidates for the 2017-2022 period. Based on the observations, we found that each DKI Jakarta governor candidate has had a popular social media account in Indonesia, namely Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Such media were used to in conducting political campaigns and interacting with their constituents. Based on in-depth analysis of the empirical data showed that the presence of social media in the political campaigns in Indonesia had a strong relationship with the final results of DKI Jakarta governor election. Relationship between the results of the general election and the popularity, participation, and activeness of candidates in using social media were shown not only in interaction quantity but also in quality of the political campaign contents.

It is a process where government and society must continue interacting to create a society-oriented government. The society-based government as a manifestation of democracy has been carried out but it does not include all regions in Muna district. This is due to several factors, namely; (1) Inadequate land and sea transportation facilities due to the government’s transportation policy; (2) economic inequality; (3) insufficient job opportunities; and (4) education.

Therefore, this study used the qualitative approach. The research was done by using direct observation and depth-interview. The research results showed that (1) the media literacy phenomenon of remote community in eastern Indonesia region was apprehensive. This was due to lack of access to information or media exposure through print media, electronic media, and social media. Therefore, the implication was the education awareness of the local community. The media literacy community has a strong relation with public awareness in improving education, and (2) the role of media in the development as facilitators or means of socialization to convey messages related to sustainable development programs in Indonesia. The current media phenomenon had become a necessity, without the exception of the remote communities. The development of an area was also characterized by the increasing education of its citizen and media became one of supporting factors that can motivate the citizen in gaining knowledge. It meant that media literacy community has strong relationships with people awareness in increasing their education. The more media literate, the more people have an awareness of self-development and their region development.

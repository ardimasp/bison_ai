This paper discusses the design of the Flipped Classroom learning model in the Introduction to Chinese Business course, by utilizing various internet-based platforms commonly used by Chinese Department students at BINUS University. The researcher implemented this learning model for 4 weeks and was evaluated by students who took the course with questionnaire and interview methods. The researcher concludes that Flipped Classroom can stimulate student enthusiasm for learning, enhance students self-learning abilities, and increase interaction between teacher to student and student to student in order to achieve optimal learning outcome of the course. In addition, Flipped Classroom can also be an alternative learning model that is transitional, from conventional learning to internet-based learning. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Curricula; E-learning; Education computing; Engineering education; Industrial research; Learning systems; Surveys; Business course; Classroom learning; Design and implementations; Higher education; Internet based learning; Learning models; Learning outcome; Self-learning ability; Students",,,,,"Ying, Y., Mursitama, T.N., Novianti, N., (2018) Pertanika J.

The availability of the Mandarin language platform as the largest foreign language after English has also become more diverse, starting with free modules available on the web/blog, as well as online course learning models. This paper collects various kinds of Mandarin language learning platforms in Indonesia, researchers qualify their types into several sections: web content based, mobile app based, video streaming based and e-learning courses-based learning platforms. This paper compares the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of each type of Chinese e-learning platform. The results of this study indicate that the challenges of the Mandarin language learning platform in Indonesia will have to prioritize functional, structural, varied and content management aspects, with the expectation of creating a massive, open and integrated learning management ecosystem. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Curricula; Engineering education; Learning systems; Content management; E-learning course; E-learning platforms; Foreign language; Integrated learning management; Language learning; Learning models; Learning platform; E-learning",,,,,"Ying, Y., Mursitama, T.N., Novianti, N., (2018) Pertanika J.

The ability of graduates can be seen from the results of treasure studies and the soft skills needed can be mapped. So far, the curriculum, and graduate competencies focus more on hard skills even though soft skills are also needed in doing a job. Therefore, this research was conducted to map the soft skills needed to do a job. Data collection was carried out from the input of 99 Chinese Literature graduates spread across three universities that have Chinese Literature study programs. From the input of the graduates, communication skills and teamwork are more needed in doing a job. Thus, policy makers are expected to consider a soft skill course that is beneficial for students in doing a job. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Students; Chinese literature; Communication skills; Data collection; Indonesia; Policy makers; Soft skills; Engineering education",,,,,"Ying, Y., Rusman, Ali, M., Evaluation of curriculum impact to Students internship: A case study in Chinese Department of Bina nusantara university, Indonesia (2018) ACM int'L.

In order to make the quality of Chinese Indonesian Literature graduates to be in accordance with the needs of the workforce, a study of the relevance of the hard skills ability of Chinese Literature graduates to the needs of the workforce needs to be done. This research focuses on the ability of hard skills needed to work as managers, translators, administrators and trainers. This research uses quantitative methods by distributing questionnaires to graduates of Chinese literature who work in the Chinese community. The results of the study of the ability of hard skills can be used to evaluate the curriculum of the Chinese Literature Study Program in Indonesia. Through curriculum evaluation, it is expected that the organizers of the Chinese Literature Study Program in Indonesia will be able to offer the courses needed to improve the competence of Chinese Literature graduates. From the results of this study, the ability of hard skills of Chinese Literature graduates is only quite relevant to the needs of the workforce. To reach a highly relevant level, several cross-science programs are needed to improve their cross-cultural management and communication skills. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Curricula; Engineering research; Personnel; Surveys; Chinese companies; Chinese literature; Communication skills; Cross-cultural management; Curriculum evaluation; Quantitative method; Research focus; Science programs; Engineering education",,,,,"Cakir, I., (2006) Developing Cultural Awareness in Foreign Language Teaching, , http://www.tojde.anadolu.edu.tr/tojde23/pdf/article_12.pdf; Evenson, R., Soft Skills, hard sell [Electronic version] (1999) Techniques: Making Education & Career Connections, 74, pp. 29-31; Clarke, W.M., The use of foreign languages by Irish exporters (2000) European Journal of Marketing, 34, pp. 80-90; Itani, S., Järlström, M., Piekkaria, R., The meaning of language skills for career mobility in the new career landscape (2015) Journal of World Business, 50 (2), pp. 368-378; Ying, Y., Rusman, Ali, M., Evaluation of Curriculum Impact to Students Internship: A Case Study in Chinese Department of Bina Nusantara University, Indonesia (2018) ACM International Conference.

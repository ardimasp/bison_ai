In this study, an attempt to employ 2nd level Wavelet Based Color Histogram (WBCH) on a CBIR system is proposed. Image database used in this study are taken from Wang's image database containing 1000 color images. The experiment results show that 2nd level WBCH gives better precision (0.777) than the other methods, including 1st level WBCH, Color Histogram, Color Co-occurrence Matrix, and Wavelet texture feature.

This trend is making people do activities on their smartphone such as exchange information, playing games, paying bills, discussing ideas, etc. In almost every smartphone, security features (i.e. password, pin, face unlock) are already built in which are intended to protect the data inside the smartphone. Nevertheless, those security features are not perfect and have flaws either technically or by human errors. This research aim to provide an application that uses people' facial expressions to improve the security of smartphone, namely Android. We implement face detection and expression recognition in this application as an improvement from the existing unlock screen, which is face unlock. The results that are achieved from this research is an unlock screen application on Android devices that utilizes people' facial expression changes to open their smartphone. This application can eliminates the technical errors from existing face unlock screen application which can be deceived by photos. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.","Biometric; Face expression recognition; Unlock screen","Android (operating system); Biometrics; Face recognition; Manufacture; Security systems; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Android smartphone; Application design; Expression recognition; Face expression recognition; Face expressions; Facial Expressions; Security features; Technical errors; Mobile security",,,,,,"Ahmad, F., Najam, A., Ahmed, Z., Image-based Face detection and recognition: ""state of the art (2012) IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, 9 (6), pp. 169-172. , no. 1; Dashore, G., Raj, V.C., An efficient method for face recognition using principal component analysis (2012) International Journal of Advanced Technnology & Engineering Research, II, 2, pp. 23-28; Saudagare, P.V., Chaudhari, D.S., Facial expression recognition using neural network-An overview (2012) International Journal of Soft Computing and Engineering (IJSCE), 2 (1), pp. 224-227; Baggio, D.L., (2012) Mastering OpenCV with Practical Computer Vision Projects, , Packt Publishing; Jiang, B., Valstar, M.F., Martinez, B., Pantic, M., A dynamic appearance descriptor approach to facial actions temporal modelling (2014) IEEE Transactions of Systems, Man and Cybernetics-Part B, 44 (2), pp. 161-174. , 2011 and; Tan, X., Triggs, B., Enhanced local texture feature sets for face recognition under difficult lighting conditions (2010) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 19, pp. 1635-1650; Valstar, M.F., Pantic, M., Fully automatic recognition of the temporal phases of facial actions (2012) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, 42 (1), pp. 28-43; Jiang, B., Valstar, M.F., Pantic, M., Action Unit detection using sparse appearance descriptors in space-time video volumes (2011) IEEE int'L.

It already proved its success not only in reducing human error in reading the mammograms but also shows better and reliable classification into benign and malignant abnormalities.This paper will report and attempt on using Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) for mammograms classification based on Gray-level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture based features.In this study, normal and abnormal breast image used as the standard input are taken from Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) digital mammogram database. The computational experiments show that RBFNN is better than Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN) in performing breast cancer classification. For normal and abnormal classification, the result shows that RBFNN's accuracy is93.98%, which is 14% higher than BPNN, while the accuracy of benign and malignant classification is 94.29% which is 2% higher than BPNN. © 2015 The Authors.

However, little is known about how women are using social media during campaign periods in the global South setting. By focusing on the use of Instagram and Twitter in Indonesia, this study examines how elected female representatives used these platforms during the 2019 legislative elections. The findings suggest that female politicians are more inclined to use Instagram than Twitter because of the features on Instagram that are heavily reliant on visual materials. Furthermore, some politicians remain sceptical in weighing up the benefits of digital campaigning since the full display of their activities through social media might put their winning strategies at risk. This study offers important insights as to how women in non-Western societies are using social media by applying unique strategies and considerations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Campaign; Indonesia; Instagram; Social media; Twitter; Women","election; social media; womens status; Indonesia",,,,"Universitas Gadjah Mada, UGM

By interviewing 28 national female politicians in Indonesia, the analysis reveals that the strongest agreement was given to the cultural/ideological explanation. It also confirms that open-list proportional representation (PR) electoral system and gender quota offer a greater opportunity for women to win an elective office. However, as elaborated in the discussion section, the rampant practices of money politics and vote counting fraud can be a stumbling block to all candidates if not properly addressed. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the subjective experience of female MPs is important and needs to be acknowledged in order to comprehend what is really harming women's political nomination. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Corruption; Election; Indonesia; Parliament; women's representation","corruption; election; electoral system; gender disparity; parliament; womens status; Indonesia",,,,,,,"Anung, P., (2013) Mahalnya Demokrasi, Memudarnya Ideologi: Potret Komunikasi Politik Legislator-Konstituen, , Costly Democracy, Fading Ideology: Portrait of Political Communication Legislator-Constituent Kompas Jakarta; Aspinall, E., Parliament and patronage (2014) Journal of Democracy, 25 (4), pp. 96-110; Aspinall, E., Sukmajati, M., (2015) Politik uang di Indonesia: patronase dan klientelisme pada pemilu legislatif 2014, , Money politics in Indonesia: patronage and clientelism in the 2014 legislative elections PolGov UGM Yogyakarta; Bano, S., Women in parliament in Pakistan: Problems and potential solutions (2009) Women's Studies Journal, 23 (1), pp. 19-35. , http://wsanz.org.nz/journal/docs/WSJNZ231Bano19-35.pdf, Retrieved from; Basu, A., Women, dynasties, and democracy in India (2016) Democratic dynasties: State, party and family in contemporary Indian politics, pp. 136-172. , K.

Previous studies have argued economic development offers women new opportunities and resources to participate in politics. Despite some notable gains in gender equality through this process, prosperous Asian nations perform poorly compared to other world regions in terms of women’s parliamentary representation. Using an emerging method of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) on a dataset of 47 Asian nations, this research suggests the level of women’s presence in legislatures throughout Asia is a result of multiple configurations of conditions beyond simply one or two explanatory variables. In contrast to the expectations of modernisation theory, this paper finds that national economic variables do not account effectively for the level of women’s political representation in Asia. Furthermore, countries with predominantly Muslim populations can still elect more women if other conditions are supportive. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Asia; gender; parliament; QCA; representation; Women",,,,,"University of Western Australia, UWA","An earlier version of this article was presented at the 2017 Women in Asia conference in Perth, Western Australia.

The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused. Please find the Literature Review text as follows: Literature review: Women's political representation in Indonesia has been steady and meagre, since the fall of Suharto's New Order regime in 1998 (see Table 1). As a means to improving women's parliamentary representation, quotas have become a part of the Indonesian electoral landscape, succeeding an international trend where rapid growth took place in the vast majority of democracies (Dahlerup, 2006b; Rosen, 2017). The government passed a bill in 2003 which requires parties to nominate at least 30% female candidates (Siregar, 2005). This intervention had some level of success, as the highest gender ratio took place in 2009 with 102 out of 560 elected MPs being women. However, in the 2014 elections, despite stronger regulations in gender quotas and an increase in the number of female candidates, the result was a slight decrease (Hillman, 2017). These patterns are common in the quota literature, which points to the importance of quota design, implementation and enforcement in ensuring representative outcomes (Dahlerup, 2006a; Kenny & Verge, 2016; M. L. Krook, 2009). To explain these dynamics of electing women into parliament, the current paper explores women's electoral success from the nomination stage to the election results. A growing body of research suggests female candidates' performance at the polling stations depends on voters' socioeconomic status, institutional aspects, and candidates' internal and external factors. The following section provides elaboration on each of these variables. Voters' socioeconomic status. Socioeconomic factors are often suggested as stimulating the supply of highly qualified women for political positions as economic development brings about a decline in traditional values as well as fertility rates (Kenworthy & Malami, 1999; Kunovich & Paxton, 2005; Paxton, 1997) and enables women to attain higher education and to participate in the workforce (Togeby, 1994). In their seminal book Rising tide, Inglehart and Norris (2003) argue countries with different levels of societal modernisation show contrasting egalitarian levels, in particular when looking at male and female roles in politics. Agrarian nations are considered as the most traditional and sex roles are deeply divided. In contrast, post-industrial societies are the most egalitarian in their beliefs about the roles of men and women, thus accepting women as much as they accept men being political leaders. Modernisation, a transition from an agrarian to a post-industrial society, should lead to a higher representation of women in elected positions (Inglehart, Norris, & Welzel, 2002). Economic development, as Rosen (2013) argues, should foster the election of women in two ways. First there is supply of competent female candidates to be chosen for elected office. For example, in highly educated geographical units, women are professionally active in two pools from which candidates and elected representatives are chosen: lawyers and teachers (Hill, 1981). In addition, with higher development there should also be higher demand for the inclusion of women in positions of power. In particular, women who take on important professional and associational positions also strive for political representation. Jayweera (1997) argues that economic development and improved women's status has little impact when it comes to gender equality in Asia. This argument received support as, in Indonesia, women's share in the decision making process (i.e. parliament) remains a stumbling block for equal representation despite a significant increase in GDP per capita (World Bank, 2018) and that gender inequality has declined in primary school enrolment and labor participation (WEF, 2017). This paper aims to test the connection between voters' socioeconomic status and electing women into parliament. Do regions with higher class status tend to vote for more women than the poorer areas? Independent variables for this aspect include consumption per capita per month, poverty rate, life expectancy, years of schooling, and the Human Development Index (HDI). District magnitudes: The literature on political institutional variables (i.e. closed lists, district magnitude, gender quotas, and placement mandates) are widely thought to facilitate the election of women in list PR systems (Schmidt, 2009). Studies suggest countries with party-list proportional representation (PR) electoral systems (Ballington, 1998; Luhiste, 2015; Tremblay, 2005) and gender quotas have a significantly higher proportion of women in parliament (Dahlerup & Freidenvall, 2005; M. Krook & Messing-Mathie, 2013; Tinker, 2004). Gender quotas in Indonesia were first introduced in Indonesia with Law No. 31 of 2002 on Political Parties. It encourages parties to have at least 30% of a party's board being women. The Indonesian Elections Commission's (KPU) Regulation No. 7/2013 and Law No. 8/2012 on General Elections stated parties must nominate candidates with at least 30% being female using the zipper system (one female in each three nominees) or be disqualified to run. However, gender quotas, clearly, has yet delivered expected outcomes as the increase in the number of female candidates is accompanied by a decline in women's electoral performance (Górecki & Kukołowicz, 2014). Scholars also suggest with larger district magnitudes than other systems (Norris, 2004) women are more likely to win. Once listed as candidates, women's position in the ballot structure is critical as under the open-list system their chances of winning is subject to their number on the aspirants' list (Paxton, Kunovich, & Hughes, 2007). The number of seats per district, also known as district magnitudes, under PR systems encourages the nomination and election of more female candidates (Kostadinova, 2007; Matland, 1998). This positive effect is taking place in Singapore, where multi-member seats have facilitated the inclusion of not only minority ethnic groups, but also women (Tan, 2014). Indonesia had 77 electoral districts for the 2014 legislative elections. The number of seats assigned to a district, ranging from three to 10, is determined by population. A study by Choi (2010) suggests from 1999 to 2009 Indonesia's electoral reform reduced district magnitude. According to the institutional literature on party systems, when district magnitude decreases, the seat-winning threshold increases, thus supposedly creating a smaller number of political parties per district. Yet, the effective number of political parties in Indonesia increased over time. This paper observes the impact of different district magnitudes on women's political nomination; whether women are more likely to be elected in electorates with more seats. In addition to that, this paper also looks into the correlation between turnout (in percentage) and women's electability. Is higher turnout translated into more women being elected as deputies? Candidates' internal characteristics: Recruitment to legislative office is one of the core functions of political systems, yet the selection of candidates often takes place far away from public scrutiny (Lundell, 2004; Norris & Lovenduski, 1995). In their book Candidate selection in comparative perspective, Gallagher and Marsh (1988) suggest the quality of candidates selected determines the quality the deputies elected and sometimes also of a country's politics. Candidates' nomination reflects political parties' priorities and strategies in winning legislative elections, thus, it is important to observe who are being nominated and where they are listed on the party tickets. Literature on political elites has long examined social backgrounds, paths to power, and political ambition among representatives (Schwindt-Bayer, 2011), yet very little of it focuses on developing countries, especially Asia (Joshi & Och, 2014). In this study, candidates' internal characteristics being observed include incumbency, age, professional background, education, marital status, and province of residence. An incumbency advantage seems widespread in legislative elections, where parties nominate more women in districts with incumbent females, and female candidates perform better with the presence of an incumbent female (Shair-Rosenfield, 2012). Another study on Indonesia asserts incumbency offers a consistent advantage to candidates for legislative elections, male and female, as incumbents are better positioned to distribute resources to build up their network (Dettman, Pepinsky, & Pierskalla, 2017). In many countries elected MPs are dominated by rather wealthy and educated middle-aged to senior men of the dominant ethnicity. According to Norris (1997, p. 6), “legislatures world-wide include more of the affluent than the less well-off, more men than women, more middle-aged than young, and more white-collar professionals than blue-collar workers”. An experimental study on Indonesia suggests young voters share a similar preference with older groups when it comes to electing female deputies (Prihatini, 2018). Aside from the lack of women, representation of age groups in national parliaments also raises an issue. Stockemer and Sundström (2018) argue political institutions matter and giving candidates the right to stand in elections as early as possible (i.e. at the age of 18) will increase the percentage of young deputies elected. To check the conformity of this body of literature with the Indonesian context, this paper examines whether candidates' characteristics explain overall and female candidates' electoral success. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,,,,,,,,"Ballington, J., Women's parliamentary representation: The effect of list PR (1998) Politikon, 25 (2), pp. 77-93; Choi, J., District magnitude, social diversity, and Indonesia's parliamentary party system from 1999 to 2009 (2010) Asian Survey, 50 (4), pp. 663-683; Dahlerup, D., What are the effects of electoral gender quotas?

With the provision of 30% candidate gender quotas implemented since the 2004 elections, how have parties responded? Do Islamist and pluralist parties differ systematically in this regard? More specifically, does religious ideology influence how parties go about meeting quotas, recruiting female candidates, and getting them elected? Or do all parties face the same challenges when it comes to getting women into parliament? Drawing on a unique dataset collected from 2004 to 2019 legislative elections and in-depth interviews with central party officers, faction leaders, and members of parliament, this article investigates these questions. The results indicate that Islamic ideology plays no obvious role in limiting female participation in legislative elections; Islamist and pluralist parties are equally good at achieving the percentage quotas of female nominees. Both groups are also similarly poor at putting female candidates first on the party lists. Indonesia's open-list proportional representation (PR) system is prohibitively expensive, and this hurts women candidates more than it does male candidates because women generally have less access to the capital necessary to purchase the top position on party lists. © 2019 The Women and Politics Research Section of the American Political Science Association.","candidates; Indonesia; Islam; Political parties; quotas; women's nomination",,,,,,,,"Ambardi, K., (2008) The Making of the Indonesian Multiparty System: A Cartelized Party System and Its Origin, , PhD dissertation, The Ohio State University; Anung, P., (2013) Mahalnya Demokrasi, Memudarnya Ideologi: Potret Komunikasi Politik Legislator-Konstituen [Costly Democracy, Fading Ideology: Portrait of Political Communication Legislator-Constituent], , Jakarta: Kompas; Aspinall, E., Parliament and Patronage (2014) Journal of Democracy, 25 (4), pp. 96-110. , https://doi.org/10.1353/jod.2014.0070; Aspinall, E., Fossati, D., Muhtadi, B., Warburton, E., (2018), https://www.newmandala.org/mapping-indonesian-political-spectrum/, Mapping the Indonesian Political Spectrum.""

This condition continues despite a series of electoral reforms, including the implementation of gender quotas and open-list proportional representation systems. By observing the demographic characteristics of over 6000 legislative candidates who participated in the 2014 general elections, this paper highlights how three groups, namely women, young people, and the outer-Java population, are heavily under-represented from the nomination stage. Furthermore, the elected female lawmakers still do not represent the vast majority of women in Indonesia, especially the different socioeconomic classes and political kinships. The findings derived from a multi-level approach suggest women's electability continues to be strongly associated with experience in political office, age, and list position on the ballot sheets. The trend shows younger women running as candidate #1 have a stronger viability in getting elected. The chance is also higher for those with existing political careers. The effects of voters' socioeconomic status on women's electability, however, offer no clear connection. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Incumbency; Indonesia; List position; Parliament; Women","election; parliament; political participation; socioeconomic status; womens status; young population; Indonesia",,,,,"I would like to thank the University of Western Australia (UWA) and Endeavour Postgraduate Scholarship for giving the support to my PhD program, Graham Brown and Samina Yasmeen for continuous supervision, and two anonymous reviewers for their comments on earlier drafts.

In a hope to improve this situation, a legislated gender quota of 30 percent for candidates in Indonesia was first implemented in the 2004 elections. In this paper, we strive to answer the question of what is the role of international NGOs in helping the process of the provision of candidate gender quotas in Indonesia. By analysing literature on the importance of gender quotas from theoretical perspectives, examples on the implementation of quotas of other countries, role of NGO in democracy as well as in women political representation, and interviews with six participants from two Indonesian NGOs and two International NGOs, who were directly involved in the process of endorsing gender quotas, we found that the influence of international NGOs has been significant and yet indirect as the pursuit of affirmative action policy is only part of the bigger project in promoting gender equality. © 2019 Associacao Portuguesa de Estudos sobre as Mulheres.

This contribution deals with Indonesian young voters (17–24 years old) by investigating (a) their shared political knowledge on electoral systems and (b) their preferences in electing female legislators. Using data from 234 respondents with various backgrounds, it argues that the vast majority of Indonesian youth are relatively less-informed with regards to the country's political and electoral systems. This paper demonstrates the gender gap exists in both political knowledge and preferences. It also suggests that young electorates offer a massive support to male over female candidates as nearly 75% of respondents are more inclined to elect a male parliamentarian. The study finds that there is no significant difference in terms of voting behaviour between young and non-young Indonesian voters during legislative elections, as both groups are influenced by gender stereotypes about the ability of male and female politicians to represent the constituents. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Indonesia; Political knowledge; Women's representation; Young voters","election; electoral geography; gender relations; parliament; political geography; womens status; Indonesia",,,,,,,"Amindoni, A., (2017) Apa yang perlu Anda ketahui tentang UU Pemilu, , http://www.bbc.com/indonesia/indonesia-40678216, What you need to know about the election law Retrieved from; Anwar, D.F., The impact of domestic and Asian regional changes on Indonesian foreign policy (2010) Southeast Asian Affairs, 1, pp. 126-141; Aspinall, E., Indonesia in 2009: Democratic triumphs and trials (2010) Southeast Asian Affairs, pp. 103-125; Aspinall, E., Parliament and patronage (2014) Journal of Democracy, 25 (4), pp. 96-110; Aspinall, E., Sukmajati, M., (2015) Politik Uang di Indonesia: Patronase dan Klientelisme pada Pemilu Legislatif 2014, , Money politics in Indonesia: Patronage and clientelism in the 2014 legislative election Research Centre for Politics and Government; Atkeson, L.R., Not all cues are created equal: The conditional impact of female candidates on political engagement (2003) The Journal of Politics, 65 (4), pp. 1040-1061; Banwart, M.C., Gender and young voters in 2004: The influence of perceived knowledge and interest (2007) The American Behavioral Scientist, 50 (9), pp. 1152-1168; Bessell, S., Increasing the proportion of women in the national parliament: Opportunities, barriers and challenges (2010) Problems of democratisation in Indonesia: Elections, institutions and society, pp. 219-242. , E.

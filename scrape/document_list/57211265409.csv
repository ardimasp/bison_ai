With the rapid growth of technology, Indonesia ministry of Tourism has developed Wonderful Indonesia applications as information system technology which intended to communicate and promote popular destinations in Indonesia. However, preliminary study shows that the usage of Wonderful Indonesia application is still low. Extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is used to examine user acceptance of Wonderful Indonesia Application. This study surveyed 100 respondents who are the active users of Wonderful Indonesia Application during 12 previous months. The result shows that perceived ease of use has significant effect on perceived usefulness, attitude and intention of use. While, Entertainment has significant moderating effect of user's attitude and intention of use. Lastly, Intention of use also has significant effect actual system use. The results will provide recommendations to Wonderful Indonesia application developers so that user's acceptance and adoption of the application will be increase in the future. © 2019 IEEE.","mobile application; technology acceptance model TAM); tourism; wonderful Indonesia application","Application developers; Extended technology acceptance models; Indonesia; Mobile applications; Perceived ease of use; Perceived usefulness; Technology acceptance model; tourism; Information management",,,,,"Mohamed, A., Tawfik, H., Al-Jumeily, D., Norton, L., Mohtam: A technology acceptance model for mobile health applications (2011) Developments in E-systems Engineering; Tsai, C., An analysis of usage intentions for mobile travel guide systems (2010) African Journal of Business Management, 4 (13), pp. 2962-2970; Ferrinadewi, E., (2008) Merek & Psikologi Konsumen: Implikasi Pada Strategi Pemasaran, , Yogyakarta: Graha Ilmu; Davis, F., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3), pp. 319-339; Memarzadeh, F., Blum, S., Adams, C., Business travelers' intention to purchase: The application of technology acceptance model (tam) (2016) Journal of Quality Assurance in Hospitality & Tourism, 17 (4), pp. 412-424; Lai, I., Traveler acceptance of an app-based mobile tour guide (2013) Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research, 39 (3), pp. 401-432. , [Accessed 19 June 2019]; (2007) Jogiyanto, Sistem Informasi Keperilakuan.

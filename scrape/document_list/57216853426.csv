In this study we explore and identify variables that affect learning experiences and how knowing they can help in applying game mechanisms to Learning Management Systems (LMS) that are flexible in their operations so that they can be improved as needed using cloud infrastructure. This study attempts to assess how, why and where gamification and cloud computing should be used in the context of learning management systems by exploring both existing learning management systems using game mechanisms and views on how gamification can be used to encourage overall student learning experiences. © 2019 IEEE.","Computer education; e-learning; Gamification; Learning Management System","Computer games; Gamification; Cloud infrastructures; Game elements; Learning experiences; Learning management system; Student learning experiences; Learning systems",,,,,"Gartner says by 2015, more than 50 percent of organizations that manage innovation processes will gamify those processes (2016) Gartner.com, , http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/1629214, [Accessed: 07-Nov-2016]; Kapko, M., Google for work vs. Microsoft office 365: A comparison of cloud tools (2016) CIO, , http://www.cio.com/article/2902255/cloud-apps/google-for-work-vsmicrosoft-office-365-a-comparison-of-cloud-tools.html, [Accessed: 07-Nov-2016]; Ghazizadeh, A., Cloud computing benefits and architecture in elearning (2012) 2012 IEEE Seventh International Conference on Wireless, Mobile and Ubiquitous Technology in Education; Tanimoto, S., Sato, R., Kato, K., Iwashita, M., Seki, Y., Sato, H., Kanai, A., A study of risk assessment quantification in cloud computing (2014) 2014 17th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems; Zichermann, G., 7 Winning examples of game mechanics in action (2016) Mashable, , http://mashable.com/2011/07/06/7-winning-examples-of-gamemechanics-in-action/, [Accessed: 07-Nov-2016]; Chatfield, T., (2010), Fun Inc.

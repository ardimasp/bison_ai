The lay out of the shear wall is very influential on the performance of the shear wall in receiving lateral forces. To investigate how the shear wall layout affecting the performance of the structure to lateral load, pushover analysis on 27 storey structure with three different shear wall shape is conducted. The three shapes of shear wall layout considered are shear wall with C shape layout, shear wall with I shape lay-out and shear wall with L shape lay-out. The shear capacities of the structure with different shear wall shapes were checked against the design requirement in SNI 1726-2012. ETABS software were used for push over analysis. Their ductility and structural performance level based on the ATC-40 method were compared for both in x direction and y direction. From the results of the pushover over analysis it was found that shear wall with C shape layout is the most favorable since it has the highest structural stiffness and smaller drift. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Capacity Curve; Ductility; Earthquake Load; Pushover Analysis; Shear Wall","Ductility; Earthquakes; Capacity curves; Earthquake load; Lateral force; Lateral loads; Push-over analysis; Shear capacity; Structural performance; Structural stiffness; Shear walls",,,,,"Nur Afandi, R., Evaluasi Kinerja seismik Struktur Beton dengan analisis pushover menggunakan program SAP2000 (2010) Jurnal Teknik Sipil.

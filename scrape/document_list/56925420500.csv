To secure the house, the occupants of the house will always have the door locked. However, sometimes the house occupants forget to lock the door due to hurry when leaving the house, or they may doubt whether they have locked the door or not. We propose an application called Door Security System which is based on Android using Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor the status of the door, controlling the door and increasing security in a house. MQTT cloud is utilized as the communication protocol between smartphone and door lock system. PIR sensor is implemented in the door lock to detect the movement near the door, while touch sensor is installed on the door handle to recognize the human hand. Should the door is opened by force, the alarm will ring and send notification to alert the house occupant on the existence of intruder in the house. The evaluation results show that motion detection sensor can detect movement accurately up to 1,6 meters ahead, and messages published between smartphone and door lock are encrypted properly so messages are safely sent. © 2019 The Authors.

However, this method leads to some problems, like a difficulty of moving a traveler to a proper position (perspective) and an inhibition of work due to damaged control panel. In this research, a model of a web-based application to control a traveler with spans by using Raspberry Pi is developed. This research's contribution is a model of a web-based application for traveler automation in all possible movements of its components. As the results, the experiments show that the program implemented doesn't take much time and the execution of a command is done in a reasonable time. Moreover, for the safety of the bridge traveler, this program also implements a sensor that works when a component is at its most downward/inward position and detecting a blocking object in the middle of a possible movement and stops the movement immediately. © 2018 The Authors.

FPPD usually deals with using one cover image to hide any data. To make it practical, a steganography method needs to accommodate concatenated data of different types of media. The steganography method should also allow large data to be distributed on multiple cover images. Therefore, there should be indicator for the start, end, and media type of each component of secret data. The purpose of this research is to develop a FPPD based distributed steganography which allow addition of multiple secret message components across multiple cover images while informing the recipient of the media type of each secret message. This is done by applying a modulus function to to adjust the values of a block to represent the start, end, continuation, and media type of secret messages. The proposed approach results in PSNR value of 37.62, below the benchmark FPPD method. This decrease in PSNR is the result of modification to the pixel value of the reference point to provide means to embed data of different media types into several images. © 2017 The Authors.

The case of Bina Nusantara University’s library is used in this study. In this kind of library, near field communication (NFC) tags are placed in the book for getting book information, borrowing or returning and theft prevention, so the application. Stocktaking is an important process to be performed periodically to monitor and maintain the quality of collections and to make these collections easily accessible for library users. However, stocktaking in libraries takes too much effort and needs to be more efficient. Design/methodology/approach: The design of the mobile application using entity relationship diagram (ERD) includes a diagram and flowchart. An evaluation is done by comparing the stocktaking effort of the latest semester and the previous semester. In the latest semester, the stocktaking is done by a hybrid of the proposed mobile application and a legacy desktop application, whereas the stocktaking of the previous semester is done only using the legacy desktop application. Findings: Evaluation of the usage of this mobile stocktaking application is 43 per cent more efficient compared to an older desktop application. Originality/value: The authors report the development of Android-based mobile stocktaking application by using Android’s NFC feature and evaluate it in a real environment. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Library stocktaking; Mobile application; NFC",,,,,,"Bohn, J., Coroamă, V., Langheinrich, M., Mattern, F., Rohs, M., Living in a world of smart everyday objects – social, economic, and ethical implications (2004) Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal, 10 (5), pp. 763-785; Golding, P., Tennant, V., Using RFID inventory reader at the item-level in a library environment: performance benchmark (2010) The Electronic Journal Information Systems Evaluation, 13 (2), pp. 107-120. , http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/55365370/using-rfid-inventory-reader-item-level-library-environment-performance-benchmark, (accessed, 24 October 2015; (2015) Near field communication | Android Developers, , https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/index.html, (accessed, 23 October 2015; Mehrjerdi, Y.Z., RFID: the big player in the libraries of the future (2011) The Electronic Library, 29 (1), pp. 36-51. , Emerald Group Publishing Limited; (2015) NXP documentation, , www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/SL2S2602.pdf, (accessed, 24 October 2015; (2005) Smart Label IC SL2 ICS20 functional specification, , www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/058031.pdf, (accessed, 30 October 2015; (2013) 1MA182_5E_NFC_WHITE_PAPER.pdf, , http://cdn.rohde-schwarz.com/pws/dl_downloads/dl_application/application_notes/1ma182/1MA182_5E_NFC_WHITE_PAPER.pdf, (accessed, 23 October 2015; Sandhu, G., Ukwoma, S., Awaking Stock taking practice in academic libraries; The Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology (2012) Proceedings of the 12th Annual Conference/Annual General Meeting, Liberty Centre, Independence Layout, , http://roar.uel.ac.uk/1771/1/AwakingStocktakingpractices.pdf, (accessed, 19 October 2015, Nigeria Library Association, Enugu: Enugu State Chapter; Singh, J., Brar, N., Fong, C., The state of RFID applications in libraries – ProQuest (2006) Information Technology and Libraries, 25 (1), pp. 24-32. , http://e-resources.perpusnas.go.id:2057/docview/215830977/fulltextPDF/588FA5637823457FPQ/7?accountid=25704, (accessed, 24 October 2015; Stevens, K., Taking stock – the process and benefits of performing a regular library stocktake (2011) The ANZTLA EJournal, pp. 2-6. , www.nla.gov.au/ojs/index.php/ANZTLA/article/view/2951, (accessed, 19 October 2015; Suda, K.A., Rani, N.S.A., Radio frequency identification for efficient library Management.pdf (2013) International Journal of Business and Social Science, 4 (15), pp. 125-131. , http://ijbssnet.com/journals/Vol_4_No_15_Special_Issue_November_2013/18.pdf, (accessed, 18 October 2015; Tajima, M., Strategic value of RFID in supply chain management (2007) Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 13 (4), pp. 261-273; Wild, T., (2004) Improving Inventory Record Accuracy, Improving Inventory Record Accuracy, , Elsevier, New York, NY; Clarke, R., Managing a reserve collection (1994) Library Review, 43 (6), pp. 18-26. , MCB UP Ltd; Curran, K., Porter, M., A primer on radio frequency identification for libraries (2007) Library Hi Tech, 25 (4), pp. 595-611. , Schmetzke, A.and (Ed.), Emerald Group Publishing Limited, Bingley","Wibisurya, A.; Bina Nusantara UniversityIndonesia; email: aswinwibisurya@gmail.com",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,07419058,,,,"English","Libr.

This research’s purposes are to compare the speed and accuracy of two multi-label classification models. The first model combines Label Powerset (LP), ReliefF (RF) and Fuzzy Similarity-based k-Nearest Neighbor (FSkNN). The second model combines LP, Distinguishing Feature Selector (DFS), and FSkNN. Speed is measured by training time and testing time consumed, while accuracy is measured using hamming loss. Based on the experiment, LP-DFS-FSkNN is faster and more accurate since its training time and hamming loss are less than LP-RF-FSkNN’s while the testing time of both models are the same. © 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Distinguishing feature selector; Fuzzy similarity-based k-nearest neighbor; Machine learning; Multi-label classification; ReliefF",,,,,,"Jinha, A.E., Article 50 million: An estimate of the number of scholarly articles in existence (2010) Learned Publishing, 23, pp. 258-263; Spolaor, N., Cherman, E.A., Monard, M.C., Lee, H.D., A Comparison of Multi-Label Feature Selection Methods using the Problem Transformation Approach (2013) Electronics Notes in Theoretical Computer Science, 292, pp. 135-151; Manning, C.D., Raghavan, P., Schutze, H., (2009) An Introduction to Information Retrieval, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Tsoumakas, G., Katakis, I., Multi-Label Classification: An Overview (2007) International Journal of Data Warehousing & Mining, 3, pp. 1-13; Jiang, J.-Y., Tsai, S.-C., Lee, S.-J., FSKNN: Multi-label text categorization based on fuzzy similarity and k nearest neighbors (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39 (3), pp. 2813-2821; Sumathi, R., Kirubakaran, E., Krishnamoorthy, R., Multi class multi label based Fuzzy associative classifier with genetic rule selection for coronary heart disease risk level prediction (2014) International Review on Computers and Software (IRECOS), 9 (3), pp. 533-540; Tsoumakas, G., Katakis, I., Vlahavas, I., Mining Multi-Label Data (2009) Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Handbook, pp. 1-19. , Springer; Trohidis, K., Tsoumakas, G., Kalliris, G., Vlahavas, I., Multilabel classification of music by emotion (2008) 9Th International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR 2008, pp. 325-330; Kononenko, I., Estimating attributes: Analysis and extensions of Relief (1994) Proceedings of the European Conference on Machine Learning on Machine Learning, , New York; Kumari, P., Nath, A., Chaube, R., Identification of human drug targets using machine-learning algorithms (2015) Computers in Biology and Medicine, 56, pp. 175-181; Uysal, A.K., Gunal, S., A novel probabilistic feature selection method for text classification (2012) Knowledge-Based Systems, 36, pp. 226-235; Uysal, A.K., Gunal, S., Text classification using genetic algorithm oriented latent semantic features (2014) Expert Systems with Applications; Ren, W., Hu, L., Zhao, K., Chu, J., Jia, B., Intrusion classifier based on multiple attribute selection algorithms (2013) Journal of Computers (Finland), 8 (10), pp. 2536-2543; Zhang, M.L., Zhou, Z.H., ML-kNN: A lazy learning approach to multi-label learning (2007) Pattern Recognition, 40, pp. 2038-2048; Saracoglu, R., Tutuncu, K., Allahverdi, N., A new approach on search for similar documents with multiple categories using fuzzy clustering (2008) Expert Systems with Applications, 2, pp. 2545-2554; Vanisri, D., A novel fuzzy clustering algorithm based on K-means algorithm (2014) International Review on Computers and Software (IRECOS), 9 (10), pp. 1731-1736; (2015) Dewey Decimal Classification Summaries, 9. , http://www.oclc.org/en-US/dewey/features/summaries.html, Inc, January, [Online].

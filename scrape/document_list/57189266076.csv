The government tries to filter every negative content to be spread out during this period. However, to detect hate speech is not an easy task. This paper presents the process of developing a dataset that can be used to build a hate speech detection model. More than 1 million tweets have been successfully collected from using Twitter API. The basic preprocessing and preliminary study using machine learning was implemented. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was used to extract the topic for each tweet to see whether these topics can be associated with debate themes. Pretrained sentiment analysis was also applied to the dataset to generate a polarity score for each tweet. From 83,752 tweets included in the analysis step, the number of positive and negative tweets are almost the same. © 2019 IEEE.","cyberbullying; election; hate speech; LDA; sentiment analysis; twitter","Computer crime; Information management; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Speech; Statistics; Cyber bullying; election; Indonesian languages; Latent dirichlet allocations; Social media platforms; Speech detection; Spread outs; twitter; Speech recognition",,,,,"ACKNOWLEDGMENT This study is fully funded by internal Nusantara University.","grant from Bina","(2018) Ini Media Sosial Paling Populer di Indonesia, , https://databoks.katadata.co.id/datapublish/2018/02/01/media-sosialapa-yang-paling-sering-digunakan-masyarakat-Indonesia, [Accessed: 08-Jun-2019]; Laksana, N.C., (2018) Ini Jumlah Total Pengguna Media Sosial di Indonesia, , https://techno.okezone.com/read/2018/03/13/207/1872093/ini-jumlahtotal-pengguna-media-sosial-di-Indonesia, [Accessed: 08-Jun-2019]; Smith, P.K., Mahdavi, J., Carvalho, M., Fisher, S., Russell, S., Tippett, N., Cyberbullying: Its nature and impact in secondary school pupils (2008) J.

One of its latest development is wearable device technology. Nowadays, the growth of this technology market is very positive. But unfortunately the growth of this technology is not followed by the availability of supporting applications that provide maximum benefits for users by utilizing personal health and activity data. This paper is intended to provide a report of our initial research in developing a health assistant solution that utilizes wearable device generated data. The whole research process is executed using Design Thinking approach that put the users as the main consideration. This initial research is started by designing a field research that can potentially gathered users' data generated from wearable device. A series of statistical and machine learning techniques are presented to analyze time series data to create a model. Finally, to implement the model, a mobile application prototype is also proposed.

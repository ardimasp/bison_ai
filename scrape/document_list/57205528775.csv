The urgency of applying effective information security can be seen in all business and non-profit entities. The article takes the case of university XYZ that uses private cloud computing as essential tools to support its business processes. The article examines the effective way of measuring the level of information security and CyberSecurity performance that focuses on private cloud use with its recommendations. The article applies the ISO 27001:2013 framework by involving all clauses in Annex A ISO 27001:2013 and COBIT5 for CyberSecurity, section Applying to CyberSecurity. Annex A ISO 27001:2013 and COBIT5 for CyberSecurity is used to measure the information security and CyberSecurity performance, respectively. The article uses a survey method to the employees in the IT division at University XYZ. The article examines the maturity level gap between current and expected results and provides necessary recommendation to improve current situation. The outcome of the article is expected to provide as a reference for information security application in higher education institutions. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","COBIT 5; CyberSecurity; Information Security; ISO 27001; Private Cloud Computing",,,,,,"Al Morsy, M., Grundy, J., Müller, I., An analysis of the cloud computing security problem (2010) 17Th Asia-Pacific Softw Eng Conf (APSEC 2010) Cloud Work Aust, p. 7; Lewis, G., Basics About Cloud Computing (2010) Softw Eng Inst, , http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/assets/whitepapers/; Pardeshi, V.H., Cloud Computing for Higher Education Institutes: Architecture, Strategy and Recommendations for Effective Adaptation (2014) Procedia Econ Financ, 11, pp. 589-599; (2016) Trends in Cloud Computing in Higher Education Colleges and Universities; Barham, B.L., Chavas, J.P., Fitz, D., Salas, V.R., Schechter, L., The roles of risk and ambiguity in technology adoption (2014) J Econ Behav Organ, 97, pp. 204-218; Foster, A.D., Rosenzweig, M.R., Microeconomics of Technology Adoption (2010) Annu Rev Econom, 2, pp. 395-424; Wagstaff, K., Sottile, C.A., (2015) Cyberattack 101: Why Hackers are Going after Universities, , https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/universities-become-targets-hackers-n429821, NBC News; Harris, C.E., Hammergen, L.R., Higher education’s vulnerability to cyber attacks (2016) Univ Bus Mag, , https://www.universitybusiness.com/article/0816-wisp, accessed March 20, 2018; Acohido, B., Improving Detection, Prevention and Response with Security Maturity Modeling (2015) Sans Inst; Surbakti, H., Cobit 4.1: A Maturity Level Framework For Measurement of Information System Performance (Case Study: Academic Bureau at Universitas Respati Yogyakarta) (2014) Int J Eng Res Technol, 3, pp. 999-1004. , 2278-0181; Rosmiati, R.I., Prayudi, Y., A Maturity Level Framework for Measurement of Information Security Performance (2016) Int J Comput Appl, 141, pp. 975-8887; ISO/IEC 27001:2013(E) Information technology — Security techniques — Information security management systems — Requirements (2013) Isoorg, pp. 1-24; (2013) COBIT 5: A Business Framework for the Governance and Management of Enterprise IT, , Isaca; (2012), COBIT 5: Implementation; Cartlidge, A., Hanna, A., Rudd, C., Ivor, M., Stuart, R., (2007) An Introductory Overview of ITIL V3; Abawajy, J., User preference of cyber security awareness delivery methods (2014) Behav Inf Technol, 33, pp. 236-247; Sohrabi Safa, N., von Solms, R., Furnell, S., Information security policy compliance model in organizations (2016) Comput Secur, 56, pp. 1-13; ISO/IEC 27000:2016(E) Information technology — Security techniques — Information security management systems — Overview and vocabulary (2016) Isoorg, p. 42; (2013) Transforming Cybersecurity Using COBIT 5; Guide for conducting risk assessments (NIST SP 800-30 R1) (2012) NIST Spec Publ, p. 95; Perrin, C., The CIA Triad, , Http//WwwTechrepublicCom/Blog/Security/the-Cia-Triad/4882008; Coss, D., Samonas, S., The CIA Strikes Back: Redefining Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability in Security (2014) J Inf Syst Secur, 10, pp. 21-45; Mell, P., Grance, T., NIST Special Publication 800-145 Definition of Cloud Computing (2011) Nist Spec Publ, 145, p. 7; Badger, L., Patt-Corner, R., Voas, J., NIST Special Publication 800-146 Cloud Computing Synopsis and Recommendations (2012) Nist Spec Publ, 800, p. 81; Bradshaw, D., Folco, G., Cattaneo, G., Kolding, M., Quantitative Estimates of the Demand for Cloud Computing in Europe and the Likely Barriers to Up-take SMART 2011 / 0045 D4 – Final Rep, 2012, pp. 1-82; Rebollo, O., Mellado, D., Fernández-Medina, E., Mouratidis, H., Empirical evaluation of a cloud computing information security governance framework (2015) Inf Softw Technol, 58, pp. 44-57; Chou, D.C., Cloud computing risk and audit issues (2015) Comput Stand Interfaces, 42, pp. 137-142; Hamlen, K., Kantarcioglu, M., Khan, L., Thuraisingham, B., Security Issues for Cloud Computing (2010) Int J Inf Secur Priv, 4, pp. 36-48; Wei, L., Zhu, H., Cao, Z., Dong, X., Jia, W., Chen, Y., Security and privacy for storage and computation in cloud computing (2014) Inf Sci (Ny), 258, pp. 371-386; Fernandes, D.A.B., Soares, L.F.B., Gomes, J.V., Freire, M.M., Inácio, P.R.M., Security issues in cloud environments: A survey (2014) Int J Inf Secur, 13, pp. 113-170; Ali, M., Khan, S.U., Vasilakos, A.V., Security in cloud computing: Opportunities and challenges (2015) Inf Sci (Ny), 305, pp. 357-383; Yulianto, S., Lim, C., Soewito, B., Information security maturity model: A best practice driven approach to PCI DSS compliance (2016) Proc-2016 IEEE Reg 10 Symp TENSYMP, 2016, pp. 65-70; Chang, V., Kuo, Y.-H., Ramachandran, M., Cloud computing adoption framework: A security framework for business clouds (2016) Futur Gener Comput Syst, 57, pp. 24-41; Shackelford, S., Proia, A., Martell, B., Craig, A., (2014) Toward a Global Cybersecurity Standard of Care?

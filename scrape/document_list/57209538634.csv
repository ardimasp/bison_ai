The locomotion models (actors) are driven by their motives and needs, aided by their visual perception systems: they are capable of detecting corners and edges of the environment so they can move without colliding into any obstacle. Each actor may regard other actors as being friendly or frightening, decisions may be made by the actors to approach, to avoid, to grasp, to eat. The graphical model must be capable of performing these actions in a realistic manner. The 2-D nature of the behavioural animation system is implimented in 3-D by assuming that the actors are anchored to the 2-D plane. This still allows flexible locomotion for most models. © 1992 IEEE.",,"Edge detection; Animation systems; GraphicaL model; Visual perception; Animation",,,,,"Research, A., (1989) Alias Animator, , Alias Research, Computer Software; Boyse, J.W., Interference detection among solids and surfaces (1979) Communication of the ACM, 22 (1), pp. 3-9. , Jan; Braitenberg, V., (1984) Vehicles, Experiments in Synthetic Psychology, , The MTT Press, Cambridge, Mass; Child, J., (1969) Australian Insects., , Cheshire Publishing Pty.

This research also examines the effect of PCA for dimensional reduction to k-NN performance. The empiric results show that k-NN classifier achieves the highest accuracy (99.8 percent) for k=3 when the pattern is represented by full dimensional feature. However, k-NN classifier only achieves 28.6 percent accuracy (for k=5) when the pattern is represented by PCAreduced dimensional feature. This low accuracy is due to several factors, among others, is the presence of high numbers of redundant or highly correlated features among ASL alphabet that makes PCA unable to separate data. Although kNN classifier accuracy is higher than the proposed classifier in [7], recognition time of k-NN classifier is longer than that of the method proposed in [7]. Therefore, k-NN classifier is suitable for early child education-based application such as self-assessment system for special need student who learns ASL alphabet finger-spelling. © 2015 IEEE.","finger-spelling recognition","Computational linguistics; Education; Nearest neighbor search; Palmprint recognition; Text processing; American sign language; Dimensional reduction; Finger spelling; Highly-correlated; K nearest neighbours (k-NN); K-nearest neighbors classifiers; Recognition methods; Recognition time; Classification (of information)",,,,,"Puente, A., Alvarado, J.M., Herrera, V., Fingerspelling and sign language as alternative codes for reading and writing words for Chilean deaf signers (2006) American Annals of the Deaf, 151 (3), pp. 299-310; Murakami, K., Taguchi, H., Gesture recognition using recurrent neural network (1991) Proc. of SIGCHI Conf. on Human Factors in Computing Systems: Reaching Through Technology, pp. 237-242. , ACM New York; Kadous, M.W., Machine recognition of auslan signs using powergloves: Towards large-lexicon recognition of sign language (1996) Proceedings of the Workshop on the Integration of Gesture in Language and Speech.; Tarchanidis, K.N., Lygouras, J.N., Data glove with a force sensor (2003) IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, 52 (3), pp. 984-989; Starner, T., Weaver, J., Pentland, A., Real-time American sign language recognition using desk and wearable computer based video (1998) Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on, 20 (12), pp. 1371-1375; Jung-Bae, K., Park, K., Bang, W.-C., Bien, Z.Z., Continuous gesture recognition system for Korean sign language based on fuzzy logic and hidden markov model Fuzzy Systems, 2002.

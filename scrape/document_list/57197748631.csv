To reach more of the target market, game developers need to maintain good performance while still delivering high quality graphical effects. Game developers want to use the most efficient ways to render game graphics, specifically particle systems, one of the most resource intensive elements in a game. Geometry shader is a new technology that was proposed to offer the right capability in rendering particle systems. The aim of this paper is to find out whether geometry shader is more efficient to render particle systems by analyzing the performance differences and resource consumption between rendering particle systems using a CPU and geometry shader. These research experiments support the power of a GPU-based geometry shader approach to render particle systems compared to the CPU rendering of particle systems. Geometry shader is shown to be effective and provides sufficient benefits for optimizing the geometry generations. However, the benefits of the geometry shader approach diminish when the particle size increases and the screen resolution gets higher. © 2016 IEEE.","game visual elements; geometry shader; GPU rendering; graphics rendering; particle system","Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Geometry; Graphics processing unit; Human computer interaction; Particle size; Geometry shader; GPU rendering; Graphics rendering; Particle systems; Visual elements; Rendering (computer graphics)",,,,,"Blythe, D., Rise of the Graphics Processor (2008) Proceedings of the IEEE, 96 (5), pp. 761-778; Zhang, Y., Qu, P., Cihang, J., Zheng, W., A Cloud Gaming System Based on User-Level Virtualization and its Resource Scheduling (2016) IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 27 (5), pp. 1239-1252; Diard, F., Using the Geometry Shader for Compact and Variable-Length GPU Feedback (2007) GPU Gems, 3, pp. 891-907. , Addison-Wesley; Zink, J., Pettineo, M., Hoxley, J., (2016) Practical Rendering and Computation with Direct3D 11, , CRC Press; Shreiner, D., Sellers, G., Kessenich, J., Licea-Kane, B., (2013) OpenGL Programming Guide: The Official Guide to Learning OpenGL, Version 4.3, , Addison-Wesley; Petersson, S., Particle System Rendering: The Effect on Rendering Speed when Using Geometry Shaders (2007) The Department of Interaction and System Design Blekinge Institute of Technology, , Thesis; Reeves, W.T., Particle Systems - A Technique for Modeling a Class of Fuzzy Objects (1983) Computer Graphics, 17 (3), pp. 359-376; Owen, G.S., Particle Systems (2000) ACM SIGGRAPH Education Committee, , https://www.siggraph.org/education/materials/HyperGraph/animation/particle.htm; Blythe, D., The Direct3d 10 System (2006) ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 25 (3). , ACM; Cebenoyan, C., Graphics Pipeline Performance (2004) GPU Gems: Programming Techniques, Tips and Tricks for Real-Time Graphics, , R.

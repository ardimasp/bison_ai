The choice of strategy was based on the analysis of current issues of MOOCs implementation as opposed to the provision of Human Resource competencies facing Industry 4.0. Those strengths and weaknesses faced with opportunities for applying the MOOCs models that were compatible with the Higher Education environment operation, such as geographical and economic of the community. The result was SPOCs learning model as one model, which can meet current learning needs that are effective, flexible, accountable, and could be run within selected class whether face-to-face, online, blended or flipped class. © 2019 IEEE.","blended; education 4.0; human-resource-competencies; learning-strategy; SPOCs","Facings; Industry 4.0; Information management; Personnel; blended; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Human resource competencies; Learning models; Learning strategy; Literature reviews; SPOCs; Learning systems",,,,,"(2016) Anoname, Guidelines for Quality Assurance and Accreditation of MOOCs, Commonwealth of Learning, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada V5H 4M2, p. 2. , http://oasis.col.org/bitstream/handle/11599/2362/2016__Guidelines-QAA-MOOCs.pdf?sequence=6&isAllowed=y; Curaj, A., Deca, L., Pricopie, R., (2018) Lennon, Mary Catharine.

The approach used in this research was a quantitative research, using survey method and regression analysis technique. Its population was the lecturer of Higher Education Institutions of Informatics in Indonesia and 271 lecturers were taken as sample and selected using stratified random sampling. The results of data analysis show that quality management system implemented by the institutions was very good as 4.15 from 5 scales. The most influenced factors were organizational culture and lecturers caring, and there no significant differences between State Higher Educations and the private. Therefore, to increase the organizational capability of Higher Education Institutions, especially informatics study, to produce higher quality graduates, must be improved the maturity of quality management systems and its factors influenced such as organizational culture and lecturers caring, and professionalism simultaneously. © 2017 IEEE.","lecturer's caring; organizational culture; professionalism and organizational capability; Quality management","Information management; Quality control; Regression analysis; Higher education; Higher education institutions; lecturer's caring; Organizational capabilities; Organizational cultures; Quality management systems; Quantitative research; Stratified random sampling; Quality management",,,,,"(2003) Tentang Nasional, pp. 9-11. , UNDANG-UNDANG REPUBLIK INDONESIA NO-MOR 20 TAHUN 2003; (2012) Engineering and Technology International Journal of Social, Behavioral, Educational, Economic, Business and Industrial Engineering, 6 (7). , http://waset.org/publications/10368/improving-teacherprofessionalism-through-certification-program-an-Indonesiacase-study, Triyanto, Improving Teacher Professionalism through Certification Program: An Indonesia Case Study, World Academy of Science, accessed 22/09/2015; Integrated Educational Certifica-tion Guidelines for Lecturers (Serdos) Book 2, p. 2014. , DIKTI, Jakarta: Ministry of Education and Culture; Shin, J.C., Mass higher education and its challenges for rapidly growing East Asian higher education (2015) Mass Higher Education Development in East Asia, pp. 7-13. , Jung Cheol Shin Gerald A.

The images include an areal photography and land satellite photoraphy or Landsat which widely used and recognize for spatial information analysis. The analysis uses mapping of situation or state of earth's surface, particularly the land surface. Landsat can be used to create topographic map, determining of attitude or height model of a certain place in the earth. Aerial photographs are used to detect changes of earth surface, in this work the changes by using Content Based Image retrieval or CBIR. The accuracy changes measurement calculates using precision and recall parameters. In this paper, Landsat images also used to detect the appear and dis appear of vegetation and other objects on the earth. More than 100 Landsat images used in this work, and around 15 images were use d as queries. The results show that accuracy of image retrieval is a quite good, which more than 75 %. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Antennas; Content based retrieval; Image segmentation; Maps; Photography; Aerial Photographs; Content based image retrieval; Content-base image retrievals; Earth's surface; Landsat images; Monitoring system; Precision and recall; Topographic map; Search engines",,,,,"Thanks to the Ministry of Research and Technology and Higher Education, the Republic of Indonesia who support with the Post Graduate Fund.

The technique generates a whole volumetric image from the measured capacitance of the region enclosed by the geometrically three-dimensional sensor. However, the data acquisition and data processing of the ECVT are done on separate applications, which makes a real time measurement and visualization cannot be achieved. This paper describes a design and development of an Integrated Data Acquisition and Data Processing application for ECVT. The application implements data acquisition and data processing in one platform. Furthermore, the designed software also provides parallel implementation of the image reconstruction to speed up the image reconstruction.

Most image reconstruction algorithms neglects the nonlinear characteristic and use instead a linearized sensitivity approach to solve the non-linear problem, affecting the accuracy of the reconstructed image. In this study, we used feed-forward neural network to solve the non-linear forward problem to replace the linearized sensitivity matrix. The reconstruction process uses an iterative linear back projection technique. Comparison results showed considerable improvement on the image reconstruction of the proposed technique. © 2014 IEEE.","Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography; FeedForward Neural Network; iterative linear back projection; sensitivity matrix","Capacitance; Feedforward neural networks; Image processing; Iterative methods; Linearization; Matrix algebra; Tomography; Electrical capacitance volume tomographies; Image reconstruction algorithm; Linear back projection; Non-linear relationships; Nonlinear characteristics; Permittivity distributions; Reconstruction process; Sensitivity matrix; Image reconstruction",,,,,,"Du, B., Warsito, W., Fan, L., Imaging the Choking Transition in Gas-Solid Risers Using Electrical Capacitance Tomography (2006) Ind.

The intermediate pictures are obtained by a special type of CMOS image sensor. An adaptive iterative-search block matching is proposed to obtain precise MVs of video-rate pictures from high-speed intermediate pictures with the reduced computational complexity. The sensor captures high-speed intermediate pictures without destructing signal charge and video-rate pictures with full signal accumulation time. The proposed active pixel sensor using bidirectional multiple charge transfer is useful for the nondestructive intermediate imaging with a reduced fixed pattern noise. The image sensor chip has been implemented by using 0.35/μm CMOS technology. It operates with 3.3 V and captures 480 frames/s high-speed nondestructive intermediate pictures and 30 frame/s fully accumulated video-rate pictures. The proposed adaptive iterative-search block matching has a comparable precision to a full search block matching with reduction of computational complexity by a factor of about 1/13, on average. It also reduces the data-loading rate from the memory by a factor of about 1/4.","Adaptive iterative-search block matching; Bidirectional multiple charge transfer active pixel; High-speed nondestructive imaging; Low-power video compression; Motion vector estimation","CMOS integrated circuits; Computational complexity; Image coding; Image compression; Image enhancement; Image quality; Image sensors; Adaptive iterative-search block matching; Bidirectional multiple charge transfer active pixel; CMOS image sensor; High-speed nondestructive imaging; Low-power image compression; Motion vector estimation; Motion estimation",,,,,,"Yoshimoto, M., Nakagawa, S., Matsumura, T., Ishihara, K., Uramoto, S., VLSI realization of MPEG2 realtime video encoder and decoder-An overview IEICE Trans.

One of the key techniques is an iterative block matching algorithm using high-speed interpolated pictures. This technique allows us to estimate the video-rate (30 frame/s) motion vectors accurately from the motion vectors obtained at high-speed frames. The proposed iterative block matching reduces the computational complexity by a factor of more than one tenth compared to the conventional full search block matching algorithm. This property is particularly useful for the reduction of the power dissipation of video encoder. Another proposed technique is a high-speed non-destructive image sensing. This technique is essential to obtain high-speed interpolated pictures while maintaining high image quality in video-rate image sensing. The estimated power dissipation of the designed CMOS image sensor is sufficiently low, allowing us to achieve a totally low-power design of one-chip CMOS cameras integrating an image sensor and a video encoder.","CMOS image sensor; Low-power design; Motion vector estimation; Non-destructive image sensing","Adaptive algorithms; CMOS integrated circuits; Computational complexity; Image quality; Image sensors; Vector quantization; CMOS image sensor; Iterative block matching algorithms; Low power design; Motion vector estimation; Nondestructive image sensing; Image coding",,,,,,"Kawahito, S., Yoshida, M., Sasaki, M., Umehara, K., Miyazaki, D., Tadokoro, Y., Murata, K., Matsuzawa, A., A CMOS image sensor with analog two dimensional DCT-based compression circuits for one-chip cameras (1997) IEEE J.

The structure of the multiplier is so simple and regular that it is suitable for VLSI implementation. Partial products in the multiplier are generated as the corresponding value 0 to 9 and are implemented by simple CMOS current-mode circuits. To add partial products in the multiplier, we introduce a redundant multi-valued adder (RMA). The RMA can add two redundant numbers in the final level of additions are also redundant. We use a high speed quaternary carry-look-ahead adder (QCLA) to convert a redundant number into a non-redundant number. The chip of a CMOS 4×4-digit quaternary multiplier is fabricated in cooperation with the VLSI Design and Education Center of Tokyo University, Japan. The chip and core sizes of the multiplier are 2.3×2.3mm2 and 1.5×1.6mm2, respectively, with 1.5μm technology. The layout design of a 16×16-digit quaternary multiplier with 0.8μm technology is also discussed for the practical use.",,"Adders; Algorithms; CMOS integrated circuits; Integrated circuit layout; Many valued logics; VLSI circuits; Current mode circuits; Partial products; Quaternary multiplier; Multiplying circuits",,,,,,,"Ishizuka, Okihiko; Miyazaki Univ, Miyazaki, Japan","Anon","IEEE","IEEE, Los Alamitos, CA, United States","Proceedings of the 1997 27th International Symposium on Multiple-Valued Logic","28 May 1997 through 30 May 1997","Antigonish, Can",46509,0195623X,,PSMLD,,"English","Proc Int Symp Mult Valued Logic",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030713664

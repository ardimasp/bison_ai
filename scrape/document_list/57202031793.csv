This study was conducted on small and medium companies that produce various products made from soybeans. The problem faced by the company is located in the production process, especially regarding the quality of its products. The purpose of this research is to investigate types of disability and the factors that cause disability issues in the production process. Data are analysed using the six sigma method, which aims to identify and decrease factors that cause disability. Six sigma claims that focussing on reduction of variation will solve process and business problems. By using a set of statistical tools to understand the fluctuation of the process, management can begin to predict the expected outcomes of that process that do not fulfil the standard and texture, caused by human factors, raw materials, production methods, machinery and equipment. The results of this analysis are expected to contribute to the company in order to be able to increase the quality of production so the company is able to grow and compete effectively in the market. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Analysis; Quality; Six sigma",,,,,,"Aboelmaged, M.G., (2010) Six Sigma Quality: A Structured Review and Implication for Future Research, pp. 1-35. , Emerald Group Publishing, Limited.

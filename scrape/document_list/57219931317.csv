The study is based on interviews with twenty people of the older and twenty people of the younger generation of Chinese descent in Glodok Chinatown in Jakarta. The interviews reveal that the dominant factor that influences the views of the older generation is their life's experience with this tradition, whereas for the younger generation the existence of the tradition within the family is dominant. The dominant factor that causes respondents to not believe in this tradition is their religious belief. The study also reveals that a lack of understanding of the background and history of selecting auspicious dates in the Chinese community is a major cause for the older as well as the younger generation to be reluctant to transmit this tradition to the next generation. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2020","Auspicious dates selection; Chinese descendants; Generational differences; Glodok Chinatown",,,,,,"Aslaksen, H., (2000) The Mathematics of the Chinese Calendar, pp. 1-40. , http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.30.6947&rep=rep1&type=pdf, Working paper, National University of Singapore Retrieved from Accessed July, 4, 2020; (2012) Celebrate Chinese Culture: Chinese Auspicious Culture, , Singapore: Asiapac Books pte ltd under authority of Beijing Foreign Language Press; Dawis, A., (2010) Orang Indonesia Tionghoa Mencari Identitas [The Chinese of Indonesia and Their Search for Identity: The Relationship between Collective Memory and the Media], , Jakarta: PT Gramedia Pustaka Utama; Karmadi, A.D., (2014) Budaya Lokal Sebagai Warisan Budaya Dan Upaya Pelestariannya [Local Culture as Cultural Heritage and Preservation Efforts], , https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbyogyakarta/budaya-lokal-sebagaiwarisan-budaya-dan-upaya-pelestariannya/, Retrieved from Accessed July 4, 2020; Shaolin, L., (2015) Folk Culture in China: Choosing Auspicious Dates, , 李 少 林.

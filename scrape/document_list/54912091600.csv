The growth of mHealth applications in the past decade has been very impressive. Nonetheless, the adoption of mHealth applications in Indonesia has been relatively low. In this research, the usability of a popularly used mHealth application in Indonesia called Halodoc was explored. The usability study was conducted in three phases, which included a usability evaluation of the existing application, a user interface (UI) redesign, and an evaluation of the new prototype. The usability evaluation was performed by a panel of UI/UX practitioners by following the ten principles of Nielsen's usability heuristics. Findings from the usability evaluation showed that many of the usability issues found in the existing application were related to 'visibility of system status', 'helping users to recognize, diagnose and recover from errors', and 'user control and freedom'. To address the identified usability issues, the user interface of the original version of the mobile application was redesigned. The developed prototype was evaluated by the same panel of evaluators. The results showed that the usability of the original version of the application had been improved. In addition, the new prototype helped to improve the findability and accessibility of the application. © 2020 ACM.","mHealth; Nielsen's heuristics; Prototype; Usability; User interface","Electronic commerce; Heuristic methods; mHealth; Usability engineering; Indonesia; Mobile applications; System status; Three phasis; Usability evaluation; Usability heuristics; Usability studies; User control; User interfaces",,,,,,"(2018) Liquid State, , https://liquid-state.com/mhealth-Apps-market-snapshot/, The rise of mHealth apps: A market snapshot.

Despite their popularity, the MOOC participation rate in Indonesia is still very low. In addition, little is known about the adoption of MOOCs in Indonesia. This study explored MOOC adoption in Indonesia by investigating attitudes, awareness and the experience of working adults in Indonesia with MOOCs. Data was collected from 85 respondents, with 31 respondents having some experience with MOOCs. It was found that although the respondents generally had positive attitudes towards MOOCs, many of them were not familiar with MOOCs. The respondents who were familiar with MOOCs mostly held professions in the information technology and education fields. Lastly, MOOC users highlighted time management and commitment as the two most important factors which determined successful participation in a MOOC. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Distance learning; MOOCs; Qualitative study; Success factors; Technology adoption","Computer applications; Computer programming; Exploratory studies; Massive open online course; MOOCs; Participation rate; Qualitative study; Success factors; Technology adoption; Technology and educations; Distance education",,,,,,"(2018) Definition of MOOC in English, , https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/MOOC; Alraimi, K.M., Zo, H., Ciganek, A.P., Understanding the MOOCs continuance: The role of openness and reputation (2015) Computers & Education, 80, pp. 28-38. , Jan. 2015; Liyanagunawardena, T.R., Adams, A.A., Williams, S.A., MOOCs: A systematic study of the published literature 2008-2012 (2013) The Int.

This research aims to investigate the usability of an online learning application and compare if there is any difference in usability between usage in desktop environment and mobile environment. The research analyzed system usability according to the Nielsen's usability model and further investigated how learnability, efficiency, errors, and attractiveness of the application in both website version and mobile app version could influence user satisfaction. The research used Duolingo, an online learning application for foreign languages, and involved Gen Y and Gen Z populations in Jakarta, Indonesia as respondents. The results show that website usage in desktop environment scored higher in learnability compared to the mobile app version; while mobile app usage scored higher in attractiveness compared to the website version. It was also observed that user satisfaction in website and mobile app were influenced by different usability factors. Efficiency and errors were found to have significant influence on user satisfaction in desktop website usage, while only attractiveness showed significant influence on user satisfaction in mobile app usage. © 2018 IEEE.","mobile app; online learning; usability; user experience; website","Computer aided instruction; Efficiency; Information management; Smartphones; Usability engineering; User interfaces; Web Design; Websites; Desktop environment; Mobile app; Mobile environments; Online learning; usability; Usability modeling; User experience; User satisfaction; E-learning",,,,,,"Kurian, S., (2017) Meet the Millennials: Produced under the Umbrella of KPMGs ITs Her Future Programme, pp. 1-22. , June; (2018) Duolingo, , https://www.duolingo.com/, [Accessed: 29-Apr-2018]; Mabrito, M., A study of synchronous versus asynchronous collaboration in an online business writing class (2006) American Journal of Distance Education, 20 (2), pp. 93-107; Nielsen, J., (1993) Usability Engineering.

Usually, patients come to hospitals or clinics to have their vitiligo conditions assessed. This can be very tiring to the patients, as vitiligo treatments usually take a relatively long period of time, which can range from months to years. To address this challenge, we present in this paper a prototype of an Android-based mobile application called Vi-DA, which stands for Vitiligo Diagnostic Assistance. Vi-DA consists of three subsystems, which are user sign-up subsystem, camera and image analysis subsystem, and progress report subsystem. The mobile application was developed in Java programming language and uses MySQL as the database system. Vi-DA adopts a vitiligo segmentation algorithm to segment input image into normal skin area, vitiligo skin area, and non-skin area. Results showed that Vi-DA gave comparable results to the previous system implemented in Matlab. User acceptance testing results also showed that all respondents agreed on the usefulness of the system and agreed to use Vi-DA again in the future. Vi-DA benefits both dermatologists and patients as not only a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tool but also as a smart application that can be used for self-assessment at home. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Acceptance tests; Computer aided diagnosis; Dermatology; Image segmentation; MATLAB; Medical computing; Mobile computing; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Mobile applications; Progress report; Segmentation algorithms; Self assessment; Skin disorders; Smart applications; User acceptance testing; Computer systems programming",,,,,,"(2017) What Is Vitiligo?, , http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Vitiligo/vitiligo_ff.asp, National Institute of Arthritis Musculoskeletal Skin Diseases [Online]; Kochmann, M., Locatis, C., Telemedicine in the Apple App Store: An Exploratory Study of Teledermatology Apps (2016) Proc. of the Int.

Some of these images are genuine, while some others have gone through modifications. Although the creation and posting of edited photographs in media are basically not prohibited, it becomes a problem when they are used improperly. Until now, the common practice in Indonesia when assessing whether an image has been modified or is original is still heavily dependent on human expert assessment that could be subjective. This research offers an alternative solution that is objective by developing a systematic image analysis method for distinguishing between original and modified image. The method utilizes high-level feature, namely the metadata of the image file, to differentiate between original and modified image. A prototype system was implemented in Visual Basic as a desktop application. The application used MS Windows GDI+. This prototype application can be used as a reliable and faster means to assist in fake image detection.

This research aims to investigate the various factors contributing to the research productivity of university faculty members through the use of decision tree modeling. Three separate models, each for junior, intermediate, and senior faculty members, were developed to quantitatively predict individual faculty member's publication output in a specific target year. The models were trained and evaluated on a dataset containing academic profiles and past publications of 78 full-Time faculty members in Binus University International by using cross-validation. The overall accuracy of the models was above 80%, with the model for the junior faculty members achieved 100% accuracy. Several key findings were identified from this research. First, possession of doctoral degree was found to be a key identifier of productive junior faculty members. Second, length of service with university did not affect research productivity. Third, tenured faculty members were identified to be productive in research after two years of consistent publications. © 2015 IEEE.","decision tree; faculty members; prediction; publications; research productivity","Decision trees; Education; Forecasting; Productivity; Publishing; Software engineering; Cross validation; Decision tree modeling; Doctoral degrees; Faculty members; Length of service; Overall accuracies; publications; Research productivity; Teaching",,,,,,"FORLAP DIKTI Website, , http://forlap.dikti.go.id/dosen/homegraphjenjang, Retrieved on August 8 2015; Smith, J.S., Fox, G.L., Park, S.H., Lee, L., Institutional antecedents to research productivity in operations: The us perspective (2008) International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 28 (1), pp. 7-26; Bhagwatwar, A., Hara, N., Ynalvez, M.A., Out of asia: Understanding the nexus between technlogy usage and research productivity in japan, singapore, and taiwan (2013) International Journal of Information Management, 33 (6), pp. 963-970; Chien, C.F., Chen, L.F., Data mining to improve personnel selection and enhance human capital: A case study in high-Technology industry (2008) Expert Systems with Applications, 34 (1), pp. 280-290; Jantan, H., Hamdan, A.R., Othman, Z.A., Knowledge discovery techniques for talent forecasting in human resource application (2009) World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, 3 (2), pp. 579-587; Al-Radaideh, Q.A., Nagi, E.A., Using data mining techniques to build a classification model for predicting employees performance (2012) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 3 (2), pp. 144-151; Hall, M., Frank, E., Holmes, G., Pfahringer, B., Reutemann, P., Witten, A.H., The weka data mining software: An update (2009) SIGKDD Explorations, 11 (1), pp. 10-18; Quinlan, J.R., (1993) C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning, , Morgan Kaufmann; McCloughen, A., Brien, L.O., Jackson, D., Esteemed connection: Creating a mentoring relationship for nurse leadership (2009) Nursing Inquiry, 16 (4), pp. 326-336; Jacob, B.A., Lefgren, L., The impact of research grant funding on scientific productivity (2011) Journal of Public Economics, 95 (1), pp. 1168-1177; Hattie, J., Marsh, H.W., The relationship between research and teaching: A meta-Analysis (1996) Review of Educational Research, 66 (4), pp. 507-542; He, Z.-L., Geng, X.-S., Campbell-Hunt, C., Research collaboration and research output: A longitudinal study of 65 biomedical scientists in a new zealand university (2009) Research Policy, 38 (2), pp. 306-317; Van Rijnsoever, F.J., Hessels, L.K., Factors associated with disciplinary and interdisciplinary research collaboration (2011) Research Policy, 40 (3), pp. 463-472; Ye, Q., Song, H., Li, T., Cross-institutional collaboration networks in tourism and hospitality research (2012) Tourism Management Perspectives, 2-3, pp. 55-64",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","International Conference on Data and Software Engineering, ICODSE 2015","25 November 2015 through 26 November 2015",,120055,,9781467384285,,,"English","Proc.

For identification in this scenario, ""relatively permanent pigmented or vascular skin marks,"" abbreviated as RPPVSM, were recently introduced as the basis for a novel biometric trait. This pilot study evaluated the interexaminer variability of RPPVSM identification. Four dermatology physicians were recruited to examine RPPVSM from 75 skin images collected from a total of 51 Caucasian and Asian subjects. The images were separated into 50 reference (""suspect"") images and 25 evaluation (""evidence"") images. The examiners were asked to perform identification by annotating RPPVSM in each of the 25 evaluation images and matching them with the reference images. The rate of misidentification was 0% while the mean rate at which examiners failed to find a match was 6%, indicating the potential of dermatology physicians performing the role of RPPVSM examiners. © 2016 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.","Biometrics; Body geometry; Digital evidence; Forensic science; Identification; Interexaminer variability; Skin mark","adult; Asian continental ancestry group; biometry; Caucasian; female; forensic medicine; human; male; middle aged; observer variation; pathology; pilot study; procedures; reproducibility; skin disease; skin pigmentation; young adult; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Biometric Identification; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Forensic Medicine; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Observer Variation; Pilot Projects; Reproducibility of Results; Skin Diseases; Skin Pigmentation; Young Adult",,,,,,"Lee, J.E., Jain, A.K., Jin, R., Scars, marks and tattoos (SMT): soft biometric for suspect and victim identification (2008), pp. 1-8. , Proceedings of the 2008 Biometrics Symposium; 2008 September 23-25; Tampa, FL.

As manual RPPVSM identification is tiring and time-consuming, an automated RPPVSM identification system is proposed in this paper. The system comprises skin segmentation, RPPVSM detection, and RPPVSM matching algorithms. The system was evaluated on 1,200 back images collected from 283 Asian and Caucasian subjects in varying pose and viewpoint conditions. The system achieved rank-1 and rank-10 identification accuracies of 76.79% and 88.97%, respectively, higher than the identification accuracies given by existing skin mark detection methods previously proposed for face recognition systems. To handle identification with limited numbers of RPPVSM, a fusion scheme with inferred vein patterns is also proposed. The fusion was evaluated on 2,360 images of chests, forearms, and thighs collected mostly from Asian subjects, who tend to have fewer RPPVSM than Caucasian subjects. The results show that the fusion improves vein identification in all body parts with improvement rates varying between 2% and 5% depending on the number of RPPVSM detected. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on automated identification in color skin images based on nonfacial skin marks and fusion with inferred vein patterns in forensic settings. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","biometrics; criminal identification; Forensics; fusion; skin mark; vein","Algorithms; Biometrics; Crime; Face recognition; Fusion reactions; Image fusion; Image matching; Image processing; Automated identification; Caucasian subjects; Face recognition systems; Forensics; Identification accuracy; Matching algorithm; Skin marks; vein; Pattern recognition systems",,,,,,"(2011) London Riots: The Third Night-Monday 8 August, , http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/blog/2011/aug/08/london-riots-thirdnight-live, The Guardian.

Although vitiligo affects only 0.5% to 1% of the world's population, vitiligo may impact patients' quality of life greatly. The success of vitiligo treatment is influenced by the accuracy of vitiligo assessment method used for monitoring the treatment progress. A popular method for assessing vitiligo is the Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI), where VASI score is calculated based on the visually observed degree of depigmentation in the skin and the area of depigmented skin. This approach has two limitations. First, it has inter-examiner variability, and second, its accuracy can be very low. While the first limitation can be addressed through training, the second limitation is more difficult to address. With visual observation, positive but small progress may be unnoticed since it usually takes some time to notice skin color changes manually. To overcome this limitation, we propose in this paper a vitiligo lesion segmentation algorithm as a part of a computer-aided diagnosis system for vitiligo assessment. The algorithm reads color skin image as input and makes use of the Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm and YCbCr and RGB color spaces to separate pigmented and depigmented skin regions in the image. The corresponding degree of depigmentation is then estimated. The algorithm was evaluated on low resolution Internet images of skin with vitiligo. The results are encouraging, indicating that the proposed algorithm has a potential for use in clinical and teledermatology applications. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.","Clustering; Computer-aided diagnosis; Medical image analysis; Pigmentation; Segmentation","Algorithms; Big data; Color; Computer aided analysis; Computer aided diagnosis; Diagnosis; Fuzzy clustering; Image segmentation; Intelligent computing; Intelligent systems; Medical imaging; Soft computing; Clustering; Computer aided diagnosis systems; Fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms; Lesion segmentations; Pigmentation; Quality of life; Segmentation algorithms; Visual observations; Clustering algorithms",,,,,,"Alghamdi, K.M., Kumar, A., Taïeb, A., Ezzedine, K., Assessment Methods for the Evaluation of Vitiligo (2012) J.

However, naturally occurring skin marks can be observed in close-up views of their back, chest, or thighs, which are usually present in evidence images. Recently, a group of skin marks named Relatively Permanent Pigmented or Vascular Skin Marks (RPPVSM) was proposed as a biometric trait for identification. Manual RPPVSM identification can be tiring and time consuming. We propose in this paper an automated RPPVSM identification system, which is composed of RPPVSM detection and matching algorithms. Three learning-based detection algorithms were developed to automatically detect RPPVSMs in color images. To evaluate these algorithms, experiments were performed on a database containing 216 back torso images from 118 subjects. The results show that high identification accuracy can be achieved and that the proposed RPPVSM identification system has high potential for forensic investigation. © 2013 IEEE.","detection; forensics; identification; matching; Skin marks","Automated identification; Child pornographies; Forensic investigation; forensics; Identification accuracy; matching; Naturally occurring; Skin marks; Algorithms; Biometrics; Error detection; Identification (control systems); Signal processing; Image matching",,,,,,"Nurhudatiana, A., Kong, A.W.K., Matinpour, K., Cho, S.-Y., Craft, N., Fundamental statistics of relatively permanent pigmented or vascular skin marks for criminal and victim identification (2011) Proc.

Identification of individuals in these images/videos can be challenging. For example, in cases of child sexual abuse, child pornography, and masked gunmen, the faces of criminals or victims are often hidden or covered and only some body parts (e.g., back, thigh, and arm) can be observed from the digital evidence. Although tattoos and scars can be used for identification in some cases, they are neither universal nor unique. We propose a group of skin marks named Relatively Permanent Pigmented or Vascular Skin Marks (RPPVSM) as a biometric trait for forensic identification. To support the scientific underpinnings of using RPPVSM patterns as a novel biometric trait, the individuality was studied. RPPVSM on the backs of 269 male subjects were examined. We found that RPPVSM in middle to low density patterns tend to form an independent and uniform distribution, while RPPVSM in high density patterns tend to form clusters. We present in this paper an individuality model for the independently and uniformly distributed RPPVSM patterns. When compared to the empirical results, this model fits the empirical distribution very well. Finally, the predicted error rates for verification and identification are reported. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Forensics; individuality; predicted error rates; probability of random correspondence; skin marks; statistics","Empirical distributions; Forensic identification; Forensics; Identification of individuals; individuality; Multimedia technologies; Predicted error; Skin marks; Biometrics; Crime; Multimedia systems; Statistics; Computer crime",,,,,,"(2011) London Riots: The Third Night-Monday 8 August 2011, , http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/blog/2011/aug/08/london-riots-third-night- live, The Guardian Aug. 8; (2011) Occupy Protest in Rome Hijacked by Rioters Who Cause Damage Put at Euro2m, , http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/16/rome-riot-damage-ringleaders- police, The Guardian Oct. 16; Motivans, M., Kyckelhahn, T., Federal prosecution of child sex exploitation offenders (2006) Bureau of Justice Statist.

Using these images as evidence in legal cases like child pornography and masked gunmen can be challenging because usually the faces of the suspects are not visible. To perform personal identification in these images, we propose a biometric trait composed of a group of skin marks including, but not limited to, nevi, lentigines, cherry hemangiomas, and seborrheic keratoses. Due to their biological characteristics, we have grouped these as Relatively Permanent Pigmented or Vascular Skin Marks, abbreviated as RPPVSM. As statistical study of RPPVSM is essential before investigating their discriminative power, we present in this paper the fundamental statistics of RPPVSM. Back torso images were collected from 144 Caucasian, Asian, and Latino males, and a researcher trained in dermatology manually identified their RPPVSMs. The statistical results show that Caucasians tend to have more RPPVSMs than Asians and Latinos, and over 80 percent of middle to low density RPPVSM patterns are independently and uniformly distributed. © 2011 IEEE.","forensics; personal identification; skin marks; spatial point pattern distribution; statistics","Biological characteristic; Biometric traits; Caucasians; Digital image; forensics; Legal case; Low density; Personal identification; Spatial point pattern; Statistical study; Technological advances; Biometrics; Computer crime; Image processing; Statistics; Wireless sensor networks; Crime",,,,,,"Jain, A.K., Bolle, R., Pankanti, S., (1999) Biometrics: Personal Identification in Networked Society, , Boston: Kluwer Academic; Jain, A., Hong, L., Bolle, R., On-line fingerprint verification (1997) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 19 (4), pp. 302-314; Zhang, D., Wai-Kin, K., You, J., Wong, M., Online palmprint identification (2003) IEEE Trans.

In utilizing this algorithm using several types of windows to obtain optimal feature extraction results, ranging from the size of 6x6, 9x9, 12 x 12 and 15x15 or a combination of several windows. However, for the use of algorithm carried out sequentially, it also requires a special strategy to obtain optimal image feature extraction results to support performance accuracy in the classification. The results of classification accuracy using K-Nearest neighborhood had reached up until the percentage to 78,4 – 81.7 percent of the image undergoing changes in scale and rotation. However, if the batik image undergoes a change in scale but the rotation is the same then the accuracy percentage can reach 98-99 percent. This algorithm is a very powerful breakthrough with lighter computing techniques than other algorithms. This research can be continued to recognize moving images, expected with maximum accuracy. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Batik; Classification; Multiscale and multilevel; Rotation; Scale; Similarity measurement",,,,,,"Hamidin, A.S., (2010) Batik, Warisan Budaya Asli Indonesia, , Yogyakarta, Indonesia: Penerbit NARASI; Pengidentifikasian Batik Berdasarkan Pola Batik and Ciri-ciri BatikMenggunakan Ekstraksi Fitur Tekstur Kain (2010) Jurnal Penelitian Mahasiswa Teknik Informatika Universitas Gunadarma, , Online; Wulandari, A., (2011) Batik Nusantara, , Yogyakarta: Andi; Doellah, H.S., Batik: The Impact of Time and Environment (2003) Andar Hadi Solo; Pratama, A.A., Suciati, N., Purwitasari, D., Implementasi Fuzzy C-Means untuk Pengelompokan Citra Batik Berdasarkan Motif dengan Fitur Tekstur (2012) Jurnal Teknik Pomits, 1 (1), p. 1; Putra, R.E., Suciati, N., Wijaya, A.Y., Implementing Content Based Image Retrieval For Batik Using Rotated Wavelet Transform And Canberra Distance (2011) Image, 2 (3), pp. 4-5; Rangkuti, H.A., Harjoko, A., Putro, A.E., Content based batik image retrieval (2014) Journal of Computer Science, 10 (6), p. 925; Sanabila, H.R., Manurung, R., (2009) Recognition of Batik Motifs Using the Generalized Hough Transform”, , University of Indonesia; Wahyudi, A.A., Manurung, M., Murni, A., (2009) Batik Image Reconstruction Based on Codebook and Keyblock Framework”, , University of Indonesia; Rahadianti, L., Manurung, R., Murni, A., (2010) Clustering Batik Images Based on Log-Gabor and Colour Histogram Features”, , University of Indonesia; Zhao, Y., Jia, W., Hu, R.X., Min, H., Completed robust local binary pattern for texture classification (2013) Neurocomputing, 106, pp. 68-76; Nurhaida, I., Noviyanto, A., Manurung, R., Arymurthy, A.M., Automatic Indonesian's batik pattern recognition using SIFT approach (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 567-576; Fahmi, H., Zen, R.A., Sanabila, H.R., Nurhaida, I., Arymurthy, A.M., Feature Selection and Reduction for Batik Image Retrieval “ (2016) Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Network, Communication and Computing, pp. 47-52. , ACM; Minarno, A.E., Munarko, Y., Bimantoro, F., Kurniawardhani, A., Suciati, N., Batik image retrieval based on enhanced micro-structure descriptor “ Computer Aided System Engineering (APCASE), 2014 Asia-Pacific Conference On, pp. 65-70. , IEEE; Rami, H., Hamri, M., Masmoudi, L., Objects Tracking in Images Sequence Using Center-Symmetric Local Binary Pattern (CS-LBP) (2015) International Journal of Computer Applications Technology and Research, 2 (5), pp. 504-meta; Afifi, A.J., Ashour, W.M., Content-based image retrieval using invariant color and texture features Digital Image Computing Techniques and Applications (DICTA), 2012 International Conference On, pp. 1-6. , IEEE; Ajay, K.S., Tiwari, S., Shukla, V.P., ”Wavelet Base Multi Kelas Image Classification using Neural Network (2012) International Journal of Computer Application”, , vol 37 – No.4; Ojala, T., Pietikäinen, M., Mäenpää, T., Multiresolution gray-scale and rotation invariant texture classification with local binary patterns (2002) Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions On, 24 (7), pp. 971-987; Alapati, A., Kang, D.S., An Efficient Approach to Face Recognition Using a Modified Center-Symmetric Local Binary Pattern (MCS-LBP) (2015) International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering, 10 (8), pp. 13-22; Heikkilä, M., Pietikäinen, M., Schmid, C., Description of interest regions with local binary patterns (2009) Pattern Recognit, 42 (3), pp. 425-436; Guo, Z., Zhang, L., Zhang, D., A completed modeling of local binary pattern operator for texture classification (2010) Image Processing, IEEE Transactions On, 19 (6), pp. 1657-1663; Jia, X., Yang, X., Cao, K., Zang, Y., Zhang, N., Dai, R., Tian, J., Multi-scale local binary pattern with filters for spoof fingerprint detection (2014) Information Sciences, 268, pp. 91-102; Kurniawardhani, A., Suciati, N., Arieshanti, I., Klasifikasi Citra Batik Menggunakan Metode Ekstraksi Ciri Yang Invariant Terhadap Rotasi (2014) JUTI: Jurnal Ilmiah Teknologi Informasi, 12 (2), pp. 48-60; Halidou, A., You, X., Bogno, B., Pedestrian detection based on multi-block local binary pattern and biologically inspired feature (2014) Computer and Information Science, 7 (1), p. 125; Trefný, J., Matas, J., Extended set of local binary patterns for rapid object detection (2010) Computer Vision Winter Workshop, pp. 1-7; Silva, C., Bouwmans, T., Frelicot, C., An eXtended center-symmetric local binary pattern for background modeling and subtraction in videos (2015) International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications, , March, VISAPP",,,,"Little Lion Scientific",,,,,19928645,,,,"English","J.

Redundant rule on 2 or more of data training image is generated in some data processing. A solution to the problem using backtracking algorithm, which will determine the appropriate class rule, is used by one of the training data images. Thus, every rule has an image of the appropriate class. In the process of inputting the data EFNN algorithm, 7 statistical parameters are used as a representation of the image characteristics, for feature extraction using wavelet Haar 2. The image becomes more leverage and has different characteristics to the representation of the image of the other. All input from crisp number is converted into fuzzy number with 5 membership function, which are Very Low, Low, Medium, High and Very High. Here, each image is represented by 7 statistical parameters and each parameter is divided into 5 categories. Percentage of accuracy in the classification process by using algorithms EFNN is above 95 percent for all data training, especially when it is compared with the original FNN. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.

This research is a using new approach which is based on similarity of 3 characteristic namely shape characteristic texture characteristic and color characteristic. The results of these two characteristics similarities will be sorted by the aggregation value of every characteristic in textures/shapes and color. The sorting process based on the characteristic similarities of the image is the process of the Best Position Algorithm. This sorting feature is derived from the extraction shape or texture and color characteristics using the wavelet transform method and adaptive histogram function that focuses on the HSI color. In order to obtain the characteristic texture/shape optimally, the type of wavelet used is biorthogonal. The purpose is to get the Approximation coefficient from the optimal decomposition subsequent processing. The resulting coefficient will be recalculated with 5texture characteristic parameters which is the mean, standard deviation, energy, correlation and entropy. Therefore the texture/shape characteristic of every research object becomes more specific and detailed. Based on the testing and utilization of Best Position Algorithm and the above mentioned methods/functions, the precision percentage will be increased up to 90 percent and more relevant, in which the research object is fruit images, flower images and batik images. © Research India Publications.","Adaptive histogram; Approximation coefficient; Best position algorithm; Rbiorthogonal wevelet",,,,,,"Aji, S., Marimin, A., Herdiyeni, Y., (2007) Retrieval of Flower Image using Fuzzy rule-based system, , Master, Computer Science, Bogor Agricultural University; Banerjee, A., Kundu, M.K., ""Content based image retrieval with fuzzy geometrical features (2003) Fuzzy Systems, 2003.

Especially when it comes to patient's conditions, such that it will be reported to a physician as soon as possible, including monitoring the patient's conditions regularly. For this reason it is necessary to have a Hospital Monitoring Information System, that is able to provide information about the patient's condition which is based on the four vital signs, temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiration. To monitor the 4 vital signs, the concept of fuzzy logic is used, where the vital signs number approaches 1 then the patient is close to recovery, and on the contrary, when the vital signs number approaches 0 then the patient still has problems. This system also helps nurses to provide answers to the relatives of patients, who wants to know the development of the patient's condition, including the recovery percentage based on the average of Fuzzy max from the 4 vital signs. Using Fuzzy-based monitoring system, the monitoring of the patient's condition becomes simpler and easier. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.","Fuzzy; Fuzzy max; In-patient; Patient; Vital signs",,,,,,"Adil, R., (2009) Perancangan Sistem Monitoring Online Pada Penderita Jantung Coroner Berbasis Identifikasi Sinyal Elevasi, , Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya, Jurnal Tekomnika; Alan Dix, J.F., (2005) Human-computer Interaction 3r D Edition, , Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458: Pearson Education, Inc; Jefrey, L., Whitten, L.D., (2004) System Analysis & Design Methods 6 Edition, , Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10020: Mc-Graw Hill Companies, Inc; Kusumadewi, S., (2003) Artificial Inteligence (Teknik Dan Applikasinya), , Jogjakarta: Graha Ilmu; Mustofa, Z., (2011) Analisis Dan Perancangan Prototype Sistem Informasi Pemantauan Perkembangan Kesehatan Pasien Panti Rehabilitasi Napza Berbasis Web Dan Mobile Access, , Thesis, UGM; Pressman, R.S., (2005) Software Engineering A Practitioner's Approach 6 Th Edition, , Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10020: McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc; Sheiderman, B., (1998) Designing the User Interface Strategies for Effective 3 Rd Edition., , Addison Wesley Longman, Inc; Stuart Russell, P.N., (2003) Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach 2 Nd Edition, , Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458: Pearson Education, Inc; Tanebaum, A.S., (2003) Computer Networks 4 Th Edition., , Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458: Prentice Hall PTR; Thomas Connolly, C.B., (2005) Database Systems, , England: Pearson Education, Inc; Vaughan, T., (2004) Multimedia: Making It Work 6 Th Edition, , 1333 Burr Ridge Parkway, Burr Ridge, IL 60527: McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc; Hofstetter, F.T., (2001) Multimedia Literacy 3 Th Edition, , 1221 Avenue of The Americas, New York, NY, 10020: McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc",,,"","EDP Sciences","2013 International Conference on Advances Science and Contemporary Engineering, ICASCE 2013","23 October 2013 through 24 October 2013","Jakarta",,21016275,,,,"English","EPJ Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901406741

In calculating the percentage of similarity is not only based on performance measurement precision but also the image of the relevant. Basically Grade value calculation is using the fuzzyfication process to get the similarity values with the S-curve which is then used as input to perform retrieval of image with the threshold algorithm. It will display the image based on the representation of the highest grade in each query image, which has been compared with the image database. High grade values indicates that the characteristic image of the sample (query) is similar to the image database and others.

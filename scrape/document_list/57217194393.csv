The formulated glucomannan–beeswax–chitosan edible coating is applied to minimally processed salak, and the characteristics of the edible coating are evaluated. The glucomannan–beeswax–chitosan edible coating not just successfully reduces the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (10%, compared to control, that is, the salak fruit coated with glucomannan only), but also decreases the water vapor transfer rate that penetrates salak fruit (by 27% vs control), and lowers the weight loss of salak fruit (<4%, compared to that of control (10% weight loss)). Peeled salak fruit coated with glucomannan–beeswax–chitosan maintains its quality at room temperature in 3 days, without any indication of mold growth. Based on the results in this study, glucomannan–beeswax–chitosan edible coating is a promising antimicrobial edible polymer coating for minimally processed salak fruit, and possibly for other varieties of fruits. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

With the addition of ZnO nanoparticles of 0.048% w/w in a solution containing 4% gelatin, the fabricated bionanocomposite film decreases the water vapor transfer rate by 27.54%, increases the tensile strength by 61.32%, reduces polymer film elongation by 60%, and inhibits the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli by more than 90%, compared to control (gelatin coating with 0% ZnO NPs). When applied to broiler chicken fillet stored in room temperature for 8 h, the gelatin–ZnO NPs 0.048% w/w bionanocomposite polymeric edible coating has the lowest weight loss rate of 17%, maintains hardness at around 80 N, stabilizes the pH of the coated chicken at 6, without any indication of rancidity or slime, with total microorganisms (4.23 log CFU mL−1) significantly below the limit set by Indonesian National Standard SNI 01–3924:2009 (5 log CFU mL−1). Based on the results, it can be concluded that the manufactured polymeric gelatin–ZnO bionanocomposite is very promising for edible coating for poultry industries, and open doors for applications in meat or fruit industries. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

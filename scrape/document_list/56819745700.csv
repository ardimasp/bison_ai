The models can be used by decision makers in a company to develop a strategy (e.g. marketing, products development) based on the prediction results. We evaluate the model using our datasets of Facebook. We collected the data by utilising Facebook API. Furthermore, we implemented a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) algorithm to the datasets to provide a dynamic prediction of customers' purchase behaviours over time. In the preliminary evaluation, we implemented our model to the datasets with t=2. In our datasets, we found that the category, electronics, was the most favourite topic to discuss, share and like regarding electronics. Interestingly, we found that a positive direction for its trend appeared in the second run of the model. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Computational prediction model; Customer purchase behaviour; Facebook datasets; Hidden Markov Model; Strategic management",,,,,,"Catanese, S., De Meo, P., Ferrara, E., Fiumara, G., Provetti, A., Extraction and analysis of Facebook friendship relations (2012) Computational Social Networks, pp. 291-324. , In A.

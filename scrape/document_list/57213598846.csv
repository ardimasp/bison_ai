Predicting employee performance in the future is a necessity for companies to success. This paper presented employee performance prediction in a company using machine learning. The machine learning process follows Cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRIPS-DM). The Naive Bayes classification method is employed to create the prediction model. The result shows that Naïve Bayes successfully correctly classified instances as high as 95.48 percent. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

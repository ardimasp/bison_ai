There are several criteria of good writing, two of them are cohesion and coherence. Research of cohesion and coherence writing has been conducted by using Centering Theory and Entity Transition Value method. However, the result can still be improved. Therefore, in this research, we tried to use Thematic Development approach which focused on the use of Theme and Rheme as a method to analyze coherence level of a paragraph, combined with CogNIAC rules and Centering Theory to analyze its cohesion. Besides improving the result of previous methods, this research aims to help users in evaluating and assessing their writing text. To achieve these objectives, the proposed method is compared to previous works as well as human judge. Based on the experiment, the proposed method yields average result of 91% which is nearly equivalent to human judge which is 92%. Thematic Development also yields better result compared to Centering Theory which is 29% and Entity Transition Value which is 0%, given the same data set of beginner and intermediate simple writing. © 2016 IEEE.","coherence; cohesion; english paragraph; thematic development","Coherent light; Centering theories; cohesion; Data set; Development approach; english paragraph; thematic development; Transition values; Adhesion",,,,,"Rustipa, K., Theme-rheme organization of learners' texts (2010) Dinamika Bahasa Dan Ilmu Budaya, 4 (2); Mitkov, R., Clark, A., Fox, C., Lappin, S., Discourse Processing (2010) The Handbook of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing, pp. 599-611. , West Sussex: Wlley-Blackwell; Not, E., (1996) Implementation of the Thematic Progression and Realization Component, pp. 09-062. , LRE Project; Miltsakaki, E., Kukich, K., Evaluation of text coherence for electronic essay scoring (2004) Natural Language Engineering, 10, p. 44; Tofiloski, M., (2009) Extending Centering Theory for the Measure of Entity Coherence, , Canadian AI.

This study's aim and result were to develop a CANREG 5 network model and to apply the model within Indonesian hospitals. The research was qualitative in nature, collecting data in the form of interviews with staff and clinicians from five teaching hospitals in different Indonesian provinces. The study found three possible network models of CANREG 5 that can be implemented in Indonesia: (1) local running network of CANREG 5, (2) fragmented network, and (3) integrated network. Each of the models can be implemented based on available information technology resources at each hospital. © 2015 IEEE.","cancer registration; CANREG; networks model","Diseases; Hospitals; cancer registration; CANREG; Indonesia; Integrated networks; Network modeling; Network models; Green computing",,,,,"Kementerian Kesehatan Republik Indonesia, (2011), http://www.depkes.go.id/index.php/berita/press-release, Online; Jensen, O.M., Storm, H.H., Purposes of Cancer Registration (1991) Cancer Registration: Principles and Methods, , O.

The implication of this situation is the need for proper information and data collection. Human Resources for Health Information System (HRHIS) works as a tool in collecting such information. The fragmented business process posed a substantial challenge towards any effort in integrating HRHIS with Health Information System (HIS) Data Bank. However, through the simultaneous utilization of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) method for model integration, Health Level Seven (HL 7) for standard data exchange, and Extensible Markup Language (XML) for standard data formatting, this study managed to construct a system model that integrated HRHIS with HIS Data Bank. The model was created subsequently enable the accuracy of HRHIS information. © 2015 IEEE.","Health Information System; HIS; HL 7; SOA","Bioassay; Data integration; Electronic data interchange; Green computing; Hypertext systems; Information services; Information systems; Personnel; Service oriented architecture (SOA); XML; Business Process; Data collection; Extensible Mark-Up language (XML); Health information systems; Health-care system; HL 7; Model integration; Simultaneous utilization; Information use",,,,,"Badan Pengembangan dan Pemberdayaan SDM Kesehatan, (2010) Rencana Aksi Penguatan Sistem Informasi Sumber Daya Manusia Kesehatan Tahun 2011-2014, , Jakarta: BPPSDMK; Firat, K., Moser, L.E., Michael, P., Melliar, S., (2008) Building a Distributed E-Healthcare System Using SOA, pp. 25-26. , Los Alamitos, CA: IT Pro; (2012), http://www.hl7.org, June.

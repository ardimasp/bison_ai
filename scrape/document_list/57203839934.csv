The research methodology which being used by this research are data collection, analysis, and design. Literature study is used for data collection methods. Analyze current replication system such as data-guard and Golden-gate are used for analysis methods. Design is method by development of prototype application to run extract, transport and recovery function for source and target database. The result of this research is a replicator application prototype for oracle database standard edition by utilizing traditional archived log was created by transaction at database. The conclusions of this are replication performance by utilizing traditional archived log has quite similarly function compared by data-guard that exist in Oracle enterprise edition in terms of data replication. © 2018 The Authors.

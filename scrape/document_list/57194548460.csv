One way is to maintain and enhance existing competitive advantages by optimizing the company’s value chain through the integration of all divisions. One way to achieve this goal is to use the tools of a planning information system called Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) to support the optimization of the company’s value chain activities from upstream to downstream, up to performance analysis of all relevant parts through data which are collected centrally to then be used as a basis for decision making. ERP is not without weaknesses, so it must be well considered what modules will be used when planning and the factors in choosing the right ERP solution.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop the implementation of information systems in the company to be able to facilitate the business processes that are running well and become more effective and efficient. One strategic application in a company is a human resource information system, but its implementation is often constrained, so the expected targets are very difficult to meet; therefore, it is necessary to look for factors that cause gaps between the targets set and the realization that occurs in human resources information system. The research method used is the method of collecting data by observing, studying the literature, and distributing questionnaires to respondents using the application, to analyze the results of the questionnaire data using the factor analysis method. The results achieved in this study are the existence of employee capital management factors, capital business process factors, and Human Resource Monitoring factors that affect the target gap and implementation performance realization. The conclusion that is obtained from these three new factors can be built a performance solution model of the implementation of human resource information systems.

In order to obtain the effectiveness of the process of sharing knowledge within the company, it is necessary to evaluate the implementation of the knowledge management system that is currently running. The purpose of knowledge management is to change the paradigm of existing knowledge in employees into knowledge that can explicitly become corporate or organizational knowledge, so that the company can be used to improve employee performance because there are sufficiently managed references or knowledge or experience or expertise that has been collected and disseminated by previous employee.The data obtained were then analyzed using the factor analysis method, and the results that five factors can affect employee performance through knowledge management systems implementation, these are the factors: human resources ability, effective information, knowledge management systems, Quality for Users, accurate information transfer, and adequate IT Infrastructure. Furthermore, from these five factors by using linear regression analysis a mathematical model can be built which can be simulated to illustrate the results of the evaluation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Factor analysis; Graph theory; Human resource management; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Multivariant analysis; Personnel rating; Regression analysis; Employee performance; Evaluation modeling; Factor analysis method; Information transfers; IT infrastructures; Knowledge management system; Organizational knowledge; Sharing knowledge; Quality control",,,,,,"Alavi, M., Leidner, D.E., Review: Knowledge management and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) Mis Quarterly, 25; Carrillo, P., Robinson, H., Al-Ghassani, A., Anumba, C., Knowledge management in UK construction: Strategies, resources and barriers (2004) Project Management Journal, 35 (1), p. 46; Dalkir, K., (2005) Knowledge Management in Theory and Practice United States: Elsevier Butter Worth-heinemann; Keyes, J., (2005) Implementing the It Balanced Scored Card : Aligning It with Corporate Strategy; Kumiawan, N., Dashboard information system central statistics agency performance based on key performance indicator (2014) Journal of the School of Electrical and Information Engineering Bandung Institute of Technology.; Laudon, K.C., Jane, P.L., (2008) Management Information System: Managing the Digitalfirm; Malhotra, Y., Integrating knowledge management technologies in organizational business processes: Getting real time enterprises to deliver real business performance (2005) Journal of Knowledge Management, 9 (1), p. 7; McCuiston, Velma, E., Knowledge management implementation : HR executive speak out (2005) The Journal of Applied Management and Entrepreneurship Proquest, 10, p. 20",,"Dafik",,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory, and Network Topology, ICCGANT 2019","26 October 2019 through 27 October 2019",,161302,17426588,,,,"English","J.

While regression analysis studies the relationship between one or more variables/independent variables (X) with one dependent variable (Y).The purpose of this paper is to describe how the factor analysis method can be used to provide solutions to operational problems such as problems with public transportation services with online applications, for this reason the research was conducted in identifying what factors influence the quality of online applications, and henceforth can be used in building mathematical models that can explain practical applications and predictions in the future. This research is explained in a quantitative descriptive form using exploratory factor analysis and regression analysis methods to process primary data and build models. The conclusion of this study is that there are 22 indicators and three factors that determine the quality of the application.

The concept was developed from the IT Balanced Scorecard (IT BSC) theory which was developed by constructing each of the existing perspectives to obtain indicators which are then used as a research instrument in the form of a questionnaire. Data were collected by distributing questionnaires to 75 respondents, but only 70 questionnaires were complete and valid for this study. The data obtained were then analyzed using the factor analysis method. The analysis shows that there are four factors that affect the performance of IT implementation, namely: IT Competency, IT Service Capability, Business Continuity, and IT improvement. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Graph theory; Multivariant analysis; Regression analysis; Surveys; Balanced scorecards; Business continuity; Factor analysis method; Information technology implementations; It competencies; IT services; Regression analysis methods; Research instruments; Factor analysis",,,,,,"Kaplan, R.S., Norton, D.P., Mastering the management systems (2008) Harvard Business Review; Kaplan, R.S., Norton, D.P., The balanced scorecard-measure that drive pervormance (1992) Harvard Business Review.; Kaplan, R.S., Norton, D.P., Alignment is not enough: Integrating business and IT management with the balanced scorecard (1992) Proceedings of the 1st Conference on the It Balanced Scorecard.

By optimally managing knowledge in the company, the business processes in the company will be effective and efficient. In order to obtain high effectiveness in the process of sharing knowledge that already exists in PT. XYZ, the evaluation of the implementation of knowledge management systems is needed to find out how to manage knowledge optimally. The purpose of knowledge management is to transform the knowledge possessed by employees into explicit knowledge owned by an organization where employees work, so that the effectiveness of knowledge management can be used to improve employee performance and employee knowledge can be maintained properly, so as to provide more benefits for the company, especially for handling customer complaints. All knowledge held by the company must be disseminated so that the company's core knowledge can be developed and knowledge management as an instrument in achieving company or company goals. Knowledge Management Systems are the main facilities for sharing the knowledge and experience of employees. So, the evaluation process is needed to find out how the process of knowledge transfer can affect KMS performance to improve employee performance. The analytical method to analyze the implementation of management in PT. XYZ is to use factor analysis and the questionnaire will be processed using factor analysis to obtain new factors that can be used as forming factors for evaluating the implementation of existing knowledge management systems to be competitive advantage. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Competition; Factor analysis; Human resource management; Knowledge based systems; Multivariant analysis; Personnel rating; Competitive advantage; Customer complaints; Effectiveness of knowledge; Employee performance; Explicit knowledge; Industrial revolutions; Knowledge and experience; Knowledge management system; Knowledge management",,,,,,"Fajar, R., Mahendrawathi, E.R., A Conceptual Model for the Use of Social Software in Business Process Management and Knowledge Management (2019) Procedia Computer Science, 161, pp. 1131-1138; Cesar, B., Fazel, K., Michael, R.B., Shiromani, N., Pi, K., Knowledge management and the entrepreneur: Insights from Ikujiro Nonaka's Dynamic Knowledge Creation model (SECI) (2017) International Journal of Innovation Studies, 1 (3), pp. 163-174; Sérgio, M., Joberto, M., Strategic knowledge management in a digital environment: Tacit and explicit knowledge in Fab Labs (2019) Journal of Business Research, 94, pp. 353-359; Johan, O., Oivind, R., Exploring the performance of tacit knowledge: How to make ordinary people deliver extraordinary results in teams (2018) International Journal of Information Management, 43, pp. 295-304; Jamal, E., Narumon, S., The Role of Opinions and Ideas as Types of Tacit Knowledge (2019) Procedia Computer Science, 161, pp. 23-31; Rajendran, M., Narendran, S., Ai Ping, T., The impact of tacit knowledge management on organizational performance: Evidence from Malaysia (2017) Asia Pacific Management Review, 22 (4), pp. 192-201; Emily, B., Michael, D.W., Gareth, D., Coopetition in innovation ecosystems: A comparative analysis of knowledge transfer configurations (2019) Journal of Business Research; Petra, A.N., Jonathan, D.R., When feelings obscure reason: The impact of leaders' explicit and emotional knowledge transfer on shareholder reactions (2015) The Leadership Quarterly, 26 (4), pp. 532-542; Alexandre, B., José, B.V., Álvaro, R., Ruben, P., A knowledge management approach to capture organizational learning networks (2017) International Journal of Information Management, 37 (6), pp. 735-740; Jamshid, A., Shahryar, S., Yasir, J., Impact of the cognitive learning factors on sustainable organizational development (2019) Heliyon, 5 (9); Abdullah, A., Jennifer, R., E-learning critical success factors: Comparing perspectives from academic staff and students (2018) Computers & Education, 127, pp. 1-12",,"Suratno",,"Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Lesson Study of Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics 2019, ICOLSSTEM 2019","16 November 2019 through 17 November 2019",,161360,17426588,,,,"English","J.

In the application of information systems, information system risk management needs to be done. In carrying out information system risk management, assessment is needed. The IT department of Rajawali Citra Televisi Indonesia company has a target of completing 600 tickets every month. The number of tickets that exceed the target of the IT department, has a gap to be a factor that influences the risk of information systems. The research was conducted to find information system risk factors and build an information system risk management assessment model. The method used in this research is confirmatory factor analysis. The factor influencing information risk is the threat factor to infrastructure. The formed model that can be used for risk management information system assessment is P = 6,934 + 1,184 X4. System risk can be said to be ideal if the company can reduce the threat factor to infrastructure, so that the risk of information systems can be minimized. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Factor analysis; Information use; Management information systems; Risk assessment; Risk management; Television broadcasting; Television systems; Business strategy; Confirmatory factor analysis; Indonesia; Information risk; Management assessment; System risk; Information management",,,,,,"Love Peter, E.D., Zahir, I., An exploratory study of information technology evaluation and benefits management practices of SMEs in the construction industry (2004) Information & Management, 42 (1), pp. 227-242; Maulana, M.M., Supangkat, S.H., Modeling Information Technology Risk Management Framework for Companies in Developing Countries (2006) Proceedings of the National Conference on Information & Communication Technology for Indonesia, pp. 121-126; Jakaria, D.A., Teduh Dirgahayu, R., Hendrik, Academic Information System Risk Management in Higher Education Using the Octave Allegro Method (2013) National Seminar on Information Technology Applications (SNATI), pp. E37-E42; Nunes, K., Pan, M.B., Peng, G.C., Risks affecting ERP post-implementation: Insights from a large Chinese manufacturing group (2011) Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, 22 (1), pp. 107-130; Zavgorodniy, V., Lukyanov, P., Nazarov, S., The Selection Algorithm of Mechanisms for Management of Information Risks (2014) Procedia Computer Science, 31, pp. 440-448; Linda, W., Mark, K., Arun, R., Understanding software project risk: A cluster analysis (2004) Information & Management, 42 (1), pp. 115-125; Sherer Susan, A., Steven, A., Information System Risks and Risk Factors: Are They Mostly about Information Systems?

However, the socialization of these two matters is not regulated in existing laws and regulations, so that the information dissemination plan and dissemination of the information must be carried out to the community itself. In line with developments in technology and information systems that have entered the era of media convergence, the acceleration of the process of spreading government programs can also be done by using this technology. The SECI method model (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization) was developed through implementation based on the 'Knowledge Management System Cycle' theory, so that a knowledge management system was formed. The results of research on community preparedness in the application of Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) for natural disaster preparedness and mitigation can be used to support the dissemination and dissemination of disaster management mitigation, global warming, and community-based climate change, including performance measurement of success. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","climate change; disaster management; dissemination; knowledge management systems; SECI model","Climate change; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Global warming; Information dissemination; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Laws and legislation; Disaster management; dissemination; Government projects; Knowledge management system; Laws and regulations; Performance measurements; Regional government; SECI model; Climate models",,,,,,"U.

The era of the industrial revolution 4.0 has also changed the way people view edu-cation. Changes made are not only ways of teaching, but are far more essential, namely changes in perspective on the concept of education itself. Likewise, what happens in the world of higher education, knowledge management systems have become a tool or facility to support the learning process. The next problem that often occurs in optimizing the implementation of knowledge management systems is how to measure the level of com-munity readiness in its implementation. Research related to the readiness of the higher education community in anticipating the industrial revolution in era 4.0 was developed based on the SECI model theory (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, and Inter-nalization) and factor analysis theory, and can be used to analyze community readiness in utilizing knowledge management systems with the substance of the learning process so that results can be achieved.

The positive impact of the presence of the digital industry, especially on transportation routes for the community is the existence of new jobs and sources of income. However, on the other hand, the existence of online transportation also presents various problems. This paper will provide an overview of the factors that affect the social welfare of online transportation drivers, using a qualitative approach through questionnaire distribution to respondents who work as public transportation drivers with online applications. The results showed that there were 4 (four) dominant factors related to social welfare and social protection for two-wheeled online transportation drivers caused by legal vacuum in the status of partnership pattern. Therefore, by producing these factors, a model that can formulate the current condition of motorists can be created, which can then be simulated to determine predictions of the social welfare conditions of online transport drivers in the future and can be used as an alternative to building one of the policy instruments and governance of public transportation operations with online applications. © 2020 ISSN 1881-803X.","Digital economy; Industrial revolution 4.0; Online application; Public transportation; Social welfare",,,,,,,"Barker, R.L., (1987) The Social Work Dictionary, , National Association of Social Workers, Silver Spring, MD; Citradewi, A., Soebandono, J.P., Influence of totali bag and psychological capital to a working satisfaction of go-jek rider in South Jakarta (2017) TAZKIYA Journal of Psychology, 22 (2); Hanafi, M., (2004) Finance Management, , BPFE Publisher, Yogyakarta; Kurniawan, H.T., (2016) Viewing Sharing Economy Concept, , ikaprama.org; (2018) The State Social Security System Program Manual or Workforce Social Security that Is Interactive and Integrated; (2017) The Results of Social Benefit Research on Demand Application: Go-Jek Indonesia Case Study, , Puskakom UI, Depok; Matofska, B., (2016) What Is the Sharing Economy?, , http://www.thepeoplewhoshare.com; (2016) Dynamic Social Protection within the Digital Economy with Solutions from SAP, , http://www.sapevents.edgesuite.net; Setiyino, B., (2018) Model & Design of Welfare State, , Nuansa Cendekia Publisher, Bandung; Suharto, E., (2005) Developing Society, Empowering Society: Strategic Study of Developing Social Welfare and Social Work, , Refika Aditama Publisher, Bandung; Swasono, S.E., Hasbullah, T., (2013) Failure of Labor Transformation, Dissimilar Social Protection, , Policy Initiative Review; Bai, D., Yin, J., Game analysis of knowledge sharing in entrepreneurial team (2019) International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 15 (1), pp. 417-422; Adi, I.R., (2005) Social Welfare Studies and Problem Work, , FISIP UI Press, Jakarta; Scott, W.R., (2011) Financial Accounting Theory, 6th Edition, , Person Prentice Hall, Canada; (2014) National Medium Term Development Plan 2015-2019 (RPJMN 2015-2019), , https://www.bappenas.go.id/id/files/7714/1557/5291/RT-RPJMN.pdf; Suharto, E., (2005) Developing Society, Empowering Society: Strategic Study of Developing Social Welfareand Social Work, , Reka Aditama Publisher, Bandung","Sardjono, W.; Information Systems, Jl.

The agriculture area in Indonesia has specific characteristic for each area (e.g., water capacity, land porosity, land height, etc.,). Furthermore, food crop is the most plant planted in Indonesia; rice, corn, red bean, green bean are some important food crops. The study aims to create a Decision Support Model based on fuzzy logic (FDSM). The model is able to recommend the most suitable food crop to be rationally planted in a specified area. The recommendation is based on distance value between plant and area characteristic value. Two main methods are operated in this study, they are fuzzy logic and Euclidean distance measurement. The method fuzzy logic purposely avoids the ambiguity of parameter value and considers the human linguistic based parameter value. Afterward, the Euclidean distance adopted to calculate the fitness value as a fundamental value for decision recommendation. Here, seven geographic parameters (i.e., water availability, temperature, humidity, land height, land slope, rainfall and land porosity) matched to food crop's biotic parameters in finding the fittest value. Finally, the model shows a simulation of recommendation for 514 administrative areas of 34 provinces' district/municipality (in Indonesia) based on five types of food crops (i.e., rice, maize, soybeans, green beans and peanuts). © 2020 Ditdit Nugeraha Utama, Alvali Zaqi Taufan, Al Ghifari Hartzani, Hasfhi Haidi, Yusuf Ramadhan Lubis and Wahyu Sardjono.","Decision support system; Euclidean distance; Food crop; Fuzzy logic; Indonesia",,,,,"Binus University","We would like to thank Bina Nusantara University who has supported and sponsored our studies and works, particularly Bina Nusantara Graduate Program, Master of Computer Science.","Abid, M., Schneider, U.A., Scheffran, J., Adaptation to climate change and its impact on food productivity and crop income: Perspectives of farmers in rural Pakistan (2016) J.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a pattern of relations between rice availability and rice consumption so that a balance occurs in the management of rice availability. The method used is the System Dynamics model, where this method is able to formulate a complex system by utilizing historically existing data to form a model, therefore this approach is expected to form a performance model of balance between rice availability and consumption which can then be simulated to predict needs in the future so that it can be used for faster and more accurate decision making. © BEIESP.","Modelsimulation; Rice availability; System dynamics",,,,,,,"Junzeng, X., Bai, W., Li, Y., Wang, H., Wei, Z., Modeling rice development and field water balance using AquaCrop model under drying-wetting cycle condition in eastern China (2019) Agricultural Water Management, 213, pp. 289-297; Muhammadi, E.A., Soesilo, B., (2001) Analisa Sistem Dinamis ‘Lingkungan Hidup, , Sosial.

By utilizing ERP, company business process activities can be integrated optimally, although in its implementation there are still many obstacles to operational problems that often occur which are reflected through the number of problem tickets. The purpose of this research is to identify the factors that cause the gap in the successful implementation between the target and its realization, then build a model that can describe the current condition, so that it can be used to analyze strategic steps in developing future implementations. Departing from concepts and theories ISO-9126 for software evaluating and SECI Model theory for Knowledge Management Development, further research instruments were built to get opinions from a number of respondents related to ERP implementation in broadcasting companies. The analysis technique used in data processing is by factor analysis method to obtain the existing gap factors and regression analysis to build a model of a number of factors formed. The results show that there are four factors that influence the gap between the realization of the implementation results and the expected implementation targets, the four factors are ERP software performance, complexity in ERP software, business flow mismatches, and user skills. Furthermore, the success of ERP implementation can be controlled by a model that can be used to simulate the influence of the four factors on the success of ERP implementation. © 2019 IEEE.","ERP; factor analysis; ISO-126; regression analysis; SECI model","Data handling; Enterprise software; Factor analysis; Knowledge management; Multivariant analysis; Regression analysis; Research and development management; Resource allocation; Enterprise resource planning (ERP); Enterprise resource planning implementations; Factor analysis method; ISO-126; Management development; Operational problems; Research instruments; SECI model; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,,"Williams, B.K., Dan Sawyer, S.C., (2011) Using Information Technology, , 9th Edition.

Floods still occur in various regions. Puddles still occur when it rains, which results in not only inhibiting community activities, but also stifling the economy in the capital city, Jakarta. Floods in Jakarta are not only caused by natural factors such as extreme weather, but also because human behavior is part of the cause, so that flooding has not been fully avoided for Jakarta residents. Although the regional government has designated the South Jakarta area as a water catchment area, these efforts have not resolved the existing problem. This study tries to look at data patterns related to flooding problems in Jakarta by utilizing time series data from records of flood events several years ago and processed using artificial intelligence programs with artificial neural network methods that are expected to explain the relationship between flooding, rainfall, population, and community behavior in handling waste. The results obtained are models of flood data patterns in Jakarta, which are expected to be used to predict and anticipate flood behavior in the capital city of Jakarta in the future. © 2019 IEEE.","artificial neural network; flood data patterns; flooding problem; handling waste","Behavioral research; Catchments; Information management; Neural networks; Population statistics; Rain; Artificial neural network methods; Community activities; Data patterns; Existing problems; Human behaviors; Regional government; Time-series data; Water catchment; Floods",,,,,,"(2010) Pengendalian Banjir Pemerintah Provinsi DKI Jakarta, , Team Mirah Sakethi.

Conversely, the success or failure of the project itself is usually measured based on business profitability which is calculated based on a fixed budget and a tight schedule. From the research that has been done and related to several previous papers. The findings show that 87 respondents had experienced problems in information systems projects, of which 70% felt that the level of completion of information systems projects carried out was at the middle level. Mostly, respondents agreed that the statement conveyed as the cause was over-budget and over-schedule. Based on the Project Management Body Of Knowledge (PMBOK) and through the approach using factor analysis methods and regression analysis for the formation of models on a number of influential variables, 6 (six) factors were obtained causing information system project failure, namely absence of sympathetic leadership, ignorance of costs, neglected latent risks, schedule tolerance, psychology becomes failed, and ineffective communication, and the main variables indicate that leadership factors are the main cause of information system project success or failure in software implementation. © 2019 IEEE.","failure factor; IS project; PMBOK; software","Budget control; Computer software; Factor analysis; Failure (mechanical); Information systems; Information use; Project management; Regression analysis; Risk assessment; Engineering process; Factor analysis method; Failure factors; Fixed budget; Information system projects; PMBOK; Project Management Body of Knowledge; Software implementation; Information management",,,,,,"Verma, S., Sekhar Bhattacharyya, S., Kumar, S., An extension of the technology acceptance model in the big data analytics system implementation environ-ment (2018) Information Processing & Manage-ment, 54 (5), pp. 791-806. , September 2018; Xiong, H., Payne, D., Kinsella, S., Peer effects in the diffusion of innovations: Theory and simulation (2016) Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Economics, 63, pp. 1-13. , August 2016; Mishra, D., Akman, I., Mishra, A., Theory of reasoned action application for green information technology acceptance (2014) Computers in Human Behavior, 36. , July 2014, 40; Keil, M., Mann, J., Rai, A., Why software projects escalate: An empirical analysis and test of four theoretical models (2000) MIS Quarterly, 24 (4), pp. 631-664; Ferreira, J., Coelho, A., Moutinho, L., (2018) Dynamic Capabilities, Creativity and Innovation Capability and Their Impact on Competitive Advantage and Firm Performance: The Moderating Role of Entrepreneurial Orientation, , Technovation, In press, corrected proof, online 12 December 2018; David, F.R., (2011) Strategic Management: Concepts and Cases, , Business & Economics Strategic Planning.

One way to survive and improve its performance is through the management of information, it is necessary to be able to see and assess the company from a variety of perspectives. One of the keys to surviving and playing a role is to manage complete, fast and precise information. Data analysis will be easy if the required data is available. Business intelligence techniques (BI) can be used to assist in the decision-making process. Many organization and educational institution have implemented BI as the support system. Therefore, we make a comparison study about BI research finding from several articles. From the comparison study it can be seen the research in the BI field is continues to grow and also following the technology trend. This can be seen from the topics discussed in the journal articles in the period 2010-2017. This study is conducted to see the spread and trend of business intelligence research in various forms of organization. Also can be seen the advantages of BI in the decision-making process. © 2019 IEEE.","Business Intelligence; decision-making; review","Competition; Information analysis; Business competition; Comparison study; Decision making process; Educational institutions; Journal articles; Strategic decision making; Support systems; Technology trends; Decision making",,,,,,"Turban, E., Aronson, J.E., Liang, T., (2007) Decision Support Systems and, , 7th ed.

This study examines the limitations of social protection according to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) which includes five elements, namely social insurance, social assistance, community protection with micro-schemes and area-based schemes, labor markets, and child protection. This study uses mixed methods with a qualitative main approach supported by a quantitative approach. The results show that there are some problems in social protection for workers in the informal sector, especially two-wheeled online transportation which is caused by a legal vacuum in the status of the partnership pattern so that it affected the welfare level of online transportation riders. Therefore, this study proposes a social protection model of informal workers in the digital era with a sharing economy system, which in its application will be supported by a fair partnership policy model so that it can provide social protection, because there are social security scheme initiatives for workers informal which requires contribution from each party to social security costs. © IAEME Publication.","Digital Industry; Online Transportation; Sharing Economy; Social Protection",,,,,,,"Barker, R.L., (1987) The Social Work Dictionary, , Silver Spring, MD: National Association of Social Workers; Citradewi, A., Soebandono, J.P., Influence of totali bag and psychological capital to a working satisfaction of gojek rider in South Jakarta (2017) TAZKIYA Journal of Psychology, 22. , http://psikologi.uinjkt.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/151163-Ardisa-Citradewi-Soebandono-OK.pdf, October 2; Hanafi, M., (2004) Finance Management (Manajemen Keuangan), , Penerbit BPFE:Yogyakarta; (2018) SJSN Program Manual ""Integrated Interactive Jamsostek Blend, , Ministry of Manpower of the Republic of Indonesia; Puskakom, U.I., (2017) The Results of Social Benefit Research on Demand Application: Go-Jek Indonesia Case Study, , Depok: Puskakom UI; Matofska, B., (2016) Whatisthesharingeconomy?, , www.thepeoplewhoshare.com/blog/what-is-the-sharing-economy, Retrievedfromhttp; (2016) Dynamic Social Protection within the Digital Economy with Solutions from SAP, , Retrievedfromhttp://www.sapevents.edgesuite.net/previewhub/socialprotection/pdfs/47768_GB_47768_enUS.pdf; Khatri, G.B., Chaudhari, D.S., A high capacity digital audio watermarking using discrete wavelet and cosine transform (2013) International Journal of Electronics and Communication Engineering & Technology (IJECET), 4 (6), pp. 71-84. , November December; Mohapatra, S.K., Bhojray, R., Mandal, S.K., Analog and digital modulation formats of optical fiber communication within and beyond 100 Gb/s: A comparative overview (2013) International Journal of Electronics and Communication Engineering & Technology (IJECET), 4 (2), pp. 198-216. , March – April; Setiyino, B., (2018) Model & Design of Welfare State (Model & Desain Negara Kesejahteraan), , Bandung: Penerbit Nuansa Cendekia; Tarekegn, G.B., Munaye, Y.Y., Application of digital cloud libraries for Ethiopian public higher learning institutions (EPHLIS) (2016) International Journal of Computer Engineering and Technology, 7 (3), pp. 187-197; Suharto, E., (2005) Developing Society, and Empowering Society: Strategic Study of Developing Social Welfare and Social Work (Membangun Masyarakat Memberdayakan Rakyat: Kajian Strategis Pembangunan Kesejahteraan Sosial Dan Pekerjaan Sosial), , Bandung: Refika Aditama; Patel, N.D., Naik, A.P., A low jitter – Low phase noise wideband digital phase locked loop in nanometer CMOS technology (2018) International Journal of Electronics and Communication Engineering and Technology, 9 (3), pp. 1-12; Swasono, S.E., Hasbullah, T., Failure of labor transformation, dissimilar social protection (2013) Policy Initiative Review July; Archanalakshmi, K.S., Iyer, A., Auto depannage digital system with endocrine cellular communication (2014) International Journal of Electronics and Communication Engineering & Technology (IJECET), 5 (12), pp. 06-16. , December",,,,"IAEME Publication",,,,,09766502,,,,"English","Int.

The implementation of the method of knowledge transfer in disaster risk reduction includes seismic disaster type, volcanic eruption, lava, landslides, floods, flash floods, tsunamis and droughts. Includes recognition of emergency response, rehabilitation and reconstruction, preparedness, prevention, mitigation and disaster management and vulnerability management. Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) allows collaborating on disaster management issues, sharing information on risk reduction activities, warning systems, handling emergencies, all of which reduce the impact of disasters. The purpose of this study was to observe the factors that influence the performance of a disaster KMS. The study involved 240 respondents and sampling was done by proportional random sampling. The results show that the evaluation models can be constructed through the function of the factors, the organizational culture and the information through KMS, the support and participation of the administration, the accessibility and the updates and the monitoring of the information. © 2018 IEEE.","disaster management; evaluation model; factor analysis; knowledge management systems","Emergency services; Factor analysis; Floods; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Multivariant analysis; Volcanoes; Disaster management; Disaster risk reductions; Evaluation modeling; Evaluation of knowledge; Knowledge management system; Organizational cultures; Sharing information; Vulnerability management; Disaster prevention",,,,,,"Seneviratne, TKK, Amaratunga, RDG, Haigh, RP and Pathirage, CP (2010).

The use and implementation of Managed File Transfer (MFT) system in company should bring a big perfomance and security impact for IT Division internally or externally. Succesful rate, perfomance rate, and supporting factor became the root cause of this research. Within this research, we know all the key-factor of perfomance measurement of MFT system and give us a blueprint about the perfomance measurement itself. This research will evaluate the perfomance of MFT system using concept of IT Balanced Scorecard (IT BSC) that have 4 perspective which will be the reference to collect data, evaluate data, and do a factor analysis using the data from the questioner. The result of factor analysis generating 4 new factor that have an important role in the MFT system level performance in the company such as System Securities, Business Support from MFT System, System Weaknesses, and System User's Comfortable. © 2016 IEEE.","IT Balanced Scorecard (IT BSC); Managed File Transfer (MFT); Perfomance evaluation","Information management; Multivariant analysis; Balanced scorecards; Business support; Enterprise companies; File transfers; Financial companies; Perfomance; Supporting factors; System-level performance; Factor analysis",,,,,,"Gorla, N., Somers, T.M., Wong, B., Organizational impact of system quality, information quality, and service quality (2010) Journal of Strategic Information Systems, pp. 207-228; Performance Analysis of Highperformance File Transfer Systems for Grid Applications, , Anglano, C., & Canonico, M.

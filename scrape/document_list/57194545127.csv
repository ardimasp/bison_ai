The System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) method was applied for the system analysis and design phases, utilizing Unified Modelling Language (UML) to model the system. Analysis was based on the company's current business processes, which results were translated into the design of a web-based information system which supports the current processes of the community empowerment program, especially in report documentation and verification, progress monitoring through an up-to-date dashboard and a Community Maturity Model (CoMM) that help organization to know better about the progress of the communities. The web-based platform enables ease of access for conducting work in various places. © 2016 IEEE.","Analysis and Design; Community Empowerment; Information System; Monitoring; Reporting; SDLC; UML","Computer simulation languages; Information management; Information systems; Life cycle; Modeling languages; Monitoring; Program documentation; Unified Modeling Language; Websites; Community development program; Community empowerments; Design of web based information systems; Documentation and verification; Reporting; SDLC; System development life cycles; Web based information systems; System program documentation",,,,,"Perencanaan, P., Nasional, B., (2015) Kajian Finalisasi Rancangan RPJMN 2015-2019, , http//jejakmu.bappenas.go.id/berita/120-kajian-finalisasi-rancanganrencana-pembangunan-jangka-menengah-nasional-rpjmn-2015-2019, October 9; Pusat Statistik, B., (2013) Data Sensus, , http//www.bps.go.id/linkTabelStatis/view/id/1493, Retrieved from Gini Ratio Menurut Provinsi Tahun 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2007-2013; (2013) Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey 2012, , Badan Pusat Statistik,Jakarta: Ministry of Health; (2014) Data Sensus, , http//www.bps.go.id/linkTabelStatis/view/id/1488, Badan Pusat Statistik,Retrieved from Jumlah dan Persentase Penduduk Miskin, Garis Kemiskinan, Indeks Kedalaman Kemiskinan (P1), dan,September; Blewitt, J., (2008) Community, Empowerment and Sustainable Development, , Cambridge, England: Green Books; Booth, R., (2010) The Spirit Level: How 'Ideas Wreckers' Turned Book into Political Punchbag, , North Yorkshire: The Guardian; Boughzala, I., Bououd, I., The development and application of a community maturity model (2013) International Journal of Information Technology and Management, 12 (3-4), pp. 273-297. , June,Retrieved November 11, 2015; (2011) Our Story, , http//www.btpn.com/about-us/our-story/, BTPN,Retrieved from About Us; (2012) About Daya, , http//www.btpn.com/daya/about-daya/, BTPN; Fowler, M., (2014) Martin Fowler, , http//martinfowler.com/bliki/MaturityModel.html, August 26,(ThoughtWorks) Retrieved November 9, 2015; Ganguly, S., Human error vs work place management in modern organizations (2011) International Journal of Research in Management and Technology, 1 (1), pp. 13-17. , http//www.iracst.org/ijrmt/papers/vol1no12011/3vol1no1.pdf; Glatzer, W.D., Below, S.V., Stoffregen, M., (2012) Challenges for Quality of Life in the Contemporary World: Advances in Quality-of-life Studies, Theory and Research, , Berlin, Germany: Springer Science & Business Media; Kasmel, A., Tanggaard, P., Conceptualizing organizational domains of community (2011) Societies, 1, pp. 3-29; Katankar, V.K., Thakare, V., Short message service using sms gateway (2010) International Journal on Computer Science and Engineering, 2 (4), pp. 1487-1491; Lyndon, N., Moorthy, R., Er, A.C., Selvadurai, S., (2011) Journal of Social Sciences.

Syahdan No. 9, Kemanggisan, Palmerah, Jakarta, 11480, Indonesia","Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) is a process of matching challenge to player skill by adjusting game parameters dynamically to improve player satisfaction. While most DDAs are performance based, mapping multiple performance metrics to satis- faction can be demanding and genre dependent. Such limitations do not apply to emotion based DDA as it attempts to address the main issue of satisfaction directly, rather than using heuristic scores. This study aims to apply emotion based DDA with Facial Ex- pression Recognition (FER) in order to improve player satisfaction. A survival horror game was designed and developed in 2 versions: One implements DDA and the other does not. An empirical experiment (N = 31) was conducted in which both versions were played consecutively. A usability test was applied to evaluating the game and the DDA model in terms of satisfaction. The result indicated that the game, as a survival horror, performed statistically well in providing satisfaction and displayed statistically significant improvement in various performance metrics while applying the proposed DDA model. © 2020 ICIC International.

A city identity as measured by its brand equity can only cover part of city’s complexities. Previous studies have suggested using corporate angle to describe the identity of a city. This research used the corporate identity model (AC 2 ID Test) to reveal a city’s identity. The sample is Bandung, capital city of West Java and the third largest city in Indonesia. Based on a qualitative approach, the corporate identity model (AC 2 ID Test) was used to discover the multi-dimensional identity of the city today. The research revealed that the current development plan of Bandung is inconsistent with several elements that make up the actual identity of Bandung today. This gap has the potential to cause an identity shift and may impact upon the city’s overall competitiveness. These findings suggest adjustments to the city planning to be consistent with the identity of the city that is embedded in the minds of the community to strengthen the characteristics and uniqueness of Bandung. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","AC 2 ID Test; Bandung smart city; City Branding; City identity; Corporate identity",,,,,,"Anholt, S., The anholt-GMI city brands index: How the world sees the world’s cities (2006) Place Branding, 2 (1), pp. 18-31; Anholt, S., (2007) Competitive Identity.

Self-efficacy and career aspirations is seen as having an influence on career success. A discriminant analysis was performed to test whether academic achievement, self-efficacy, and career aspirations could be used as predictors to differentiate between a person who was successful and a person who was less so in their career, especially in the early years of employment. More successful people had a tendency for Pure Challenge by which is meant that the person is able to overcome challenges and a readiness to take charge. Lifestyle aspiration is also seen as important in career development. And the last aspiration was Entrepreneurship, indicating that a more successful person usually wanted to build something and take charge. The findings of this research support the claim that academic achievement was not the only factor which contributed to career success. Self-efficacy, and career aspirations play a role in the career success.","Academic achievement; Career aspirations; Career success; Generation Y; Self-efficacy; Training and development",,,,,,"Abele, A., Wiese, B., The nomological network of self-management strategies and career success (2008) Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 73, pp. 490-497; Bandura, A., (1994) Encyclopedia of Human Behavior, 4, pp. 71-81. , Self-Efficacy.

Data were taken from the distribution of questionnaires to 400 respondents. Researchers used the UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) model combined with the Information System Success DeLone and McLean Model. The variables contained in the proposed model can be analyzed using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique. The analysis shows that the variable that most contributed and influenced the Use variable was the Intention to Use variable, then the Service Quality variable, and the Net Benefit variable. While the variable that most contributed and influenced the Intention to Use variable was the User Satisfaction variable, then the System Quality variable, and the Social Influence variable. The variable that most provided and changed the User Satisfaction variable is the Net Benefit, then the Information Quality variable, and the Service Quality variable. These factors need to be improved to increase the use of Internet Forum KASKUS. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

In increasing the value of its business, many hospitals open branches in various regions so that it requires integration from each branch. However, there is often a failure of IT (Information Technology) implementation because there is no alignment with the objectives of the organization where each hospital incorporated in the group still works independently. Enterprise Architecture is one solution to overcome the failure of IT implementation in organizations. This study aims to build Enterprise Architecture in the hospital group. The case study to support this research was conducted in one of the hospital groups in Indonesia namely Kasih Group. The method used is a combination of ESIA (Eliminate, Simplify, Integrate, Automate) and TOGAF ADM (The Open Group Architecture Framework Architecture Development Method). The results of this study are the Enterprise Architecture design in the hospital group which consists of 5 phases, namely: business engineering, initialize architecture, business architecture development, information system architecture and develop technology architecture. © 2019 IEEE","Enterprise architecture; ESIA; Hospital group; TOGAF ADM","Business architecture; Business engineering; Development method; Enterprise Architecture; ESIA; Information system architecture; Open group architecture frameworks; Technology architectures; Hospitals",,,,,"Purnawan, D.A., Surendro, K., Building enterprise architecture for hospital information system (2016) Fourth International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies (ICoICT); Sajid, M., Ahsan, K., Enterprise architecture for healthcare organizations (2014) World Applied Sciences Journal, 30 (10), pp. 1330-1333. , 2014; Shah, H., Ahsan, K., Kingston, P., Healthcare modelling through enterprise architecture: A hospital case (2010) Seventh International Conference on Information Technology, pp. 460-465; Bobarshad, H., Rezaei, M.S., Saghafi, F., Hospital enterprise architecture framework (Study of iranian university hospital organization) (2018) International Journal of Medical Informatics; Rijo, R., Martinho, R., Ermida, D., (2015) Developing an Enterprise Architecture Proof of Concept in a Portuguese Hospital, , Elsevier B; Handayani, P.W., Pinem, A.A., Munajat, Q., Azzahro, F., Hidayanto, A.N., Ayuningtyas, D., Sartono, A., Health referral enterprise architecture design in Indonesia (2019) The Korean Society of Medical Informatics; Qurratuaini, H., Designing enterprise architecture based on TOGAF 9.1 framework (2018) International Conference on Engineering and Applied Technology (ICEAT); Wikusna, W., (2017) Enterprise Architecture Model for Vocational High School, , School of Applied Science, Telkom University; Nugroho, H., Proposed IT governance at hospital based on COBIT 5 framework (2017) School of Applied Science, , Telkom University; Sajid, M., Ahsan, K., Role of enterprise architecture in healthcare organizations and knowledge-based medical diagnosis system (2016) Journal of Information Systems and Technology Management; Microservices Reference Architecture, , www.ibm.com, Online.Available:https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/architectures/ microservices/reference-architecture.

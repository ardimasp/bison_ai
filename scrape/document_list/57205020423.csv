They are possibly utilized by a football team to select a strategy to play. One strategy is to choice a proper sparring-partner in exercise. For fulfilling the purpose, the study with objective is to construct an intelligent model for choosing the most proper sparring-partner for friendly-match was academically performed. Here, two methods fuzzy logic and Euclidean distance are applied as fundamental method of model. The method fuzzy logic is operated by experts to justify nine selected parameters' urgency, and the method Euclidean distance is benefitted to calculate the fitness value of two soccer teams' combination. The object oriented method is employed to design the model. Finally, in the study result, the created model shows the list of the fittest sparring-partners of each team recorded. © 2018 IEEE.","Euclidean distance; football game; fuzzy logic; intelligent model; object oriented; sparring-partner","Computer circuits; Information management; Sports; Euclidean distance; Football game; Intelligent modeling; Object oriented; Sparring Partners; Fuzzy logic",,,,,"Utama, D.N., Lazuardi, L.I., Qadrya, H.A., Caroline, B.M., Renanda, T., Prima, A., Worth eat: An intelligent application for restaurant recommendation based on customer preference (Case study: Five types of restaurant in Tangerang Selatan region, Indonesia) (2017) International Conference on Information and Communication Technology; Shaahmadi, F., Anbaz, M.A., Bazooyar, B., Analysis of intelligent models in prediction nitrous oxide (N2O) solubility in ionic liquids (ILs) (2017) Journal of Molecular Liquids, 246, pp. 48-57; Korovin, I.S., Tkachenko, M.G., Intelligent oilfield model (2016) Procedia Computer Science, 101 (101), pp. 300-303; Sancar, N., Tinazli, M., Development of an intelligent model to estimate the probability of having metabolic syndrome (2016) Procedia Computer Science, 102, pp. 106-112; Mohamadi-Baghmolaei, M., Azin, R., Osfouri, S., Mohamadi-Baghmolaei, R., Zarei, Z., Prediction of gas compressibility factor using intelligent models (2015) Natural Gas Industry B, 2 (4), pp. 283-294; Shi, L., An, R., An optimization design approach of football stadium canopy forms based on field wind environment simulation (2017) Energy Procedia, 134, pp. 757-767; Martins, R.G., Martins, A.S., Neves, L.A., Lima, L.V., Flores, E.L., Do Nascimento, M.Z., Exploring polynomial classifier to predict match results in football championships (2017) Expert Systems with Applications, 83, pp. 79-93; Makdissi, M., Davis, G., Using video analysis for concussion surveillance in Australian football (2017) Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, 19 (12), pp. 958-963; Sener, I., Karapolatgil, A.A., Rules of the game: Strategy in football industry (2015) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 207, pp. 10-19; Irawan, D., Putra, D., Aswi, R., Sistem pendukung keputusan penentuan posisi pemain dalam strategi formasi futsal (2015) Seminar Nasional Teknologi Informasi Dan Multimedia; Zadeh, L.A., Fuzzy logic = computing with words (1996) IEEE Transaction of Fuzzy Systems, 4 (2), pp. 103-111; Utama, D.N., Nuryasin, F., Rustamaji Nurbojatmiko, E., Qoyim, I., D&T: An Euclidean distance optimization based intelligent donation system model for solving the communitys problem (2016) Journal of Physics: Conf.

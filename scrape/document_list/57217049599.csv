It is discovered that the three advertisements position Apple products as the heroes of the stories, contain dramatic or exaggerated events and narrate a universal problem known by the majority of the society. These points then contribute to the three advertisements’ narrative probability and fidelity introduced in Walter Fisher’s (1985b) narrative paradigm. After the analysis, it is found that all the three of Apple’s story-based advertisements discussed in this study contain adequate narrative probability and fidelity, making Apple’s selling message in these advertisements believable. © 2020 Mudra Institute of Communications, Ahmedabad, India.","advertisement; Apple; fidelity; probability; storytelling",,,,,,,"Ballester, E.D., Sabiote, E.F., Once upon a brand: Storytelling practices by Spanish brands (2016) Spanish Journal of Marketing, 20, pp. 115-131. , &; Dessart, L., Do ads that tell a story always perform better?

Community participation was considered as a key to the success of the concept in practice. This study aimed in exploring the community participation in developing zero-waste city, through promoting zero-waste lifestyles. In collaborating with the NGO, local government supported the program on facilitators training that assisted community on waste handling. Consequently, facilitators as peer education in fostering behavior changed on waste handling, thus communication and collaboration among facilitators encouraged them in developing various inventive programs in raising waste handling literacy, awareness, and participation in the program. The facilitators used the WhatsApp group as a channel of communication and information sharing because the application enables wider space to share the idea of creation in raising community awareness of waste handling. Focusing to answer the research question of how the WhatsApp group supported the effectiveness of zero waste literacy among facilitators in the project area of zero waste place, this study used netnography to explore the answer. Conversation analysis conducted to complete the netnograpic in figuring out the social relations among facilitators. The result showed that the members of the group could be both a speaker and a receiver at the same time. The member of the discussion could respond to the various topic simultaneously also without a missing point of the conversation. Accordingly, this unique characteristic could be concluded as an effective channel in delivering the message of zero waste literacy among group members. © 2020 IEEE.","Conversation analysis; Netnography; WhatsApp; Zero waste literacy","Information management; Communication and collaborations; Community participation; Conversation analysis; Information sharing; Local government; Research questions; Social relations; Waste handling; Waste management",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

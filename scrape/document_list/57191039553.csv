Online learning or e-learning is an alternative to accelerate English learning since it is no limitation to time and place. Universities around the world are investigating e-learning system to support their traditional teaching system. Some previous research showed an effective learning system when meet the students’ needs This study was undertaken to find out whether the implementation of English online learning system would give positive impacts for the students in Binus University. The study was done by spreading survey questionnaire with Google Form and through two forms of social media, such as Line and WhatsApp, had yielded responses from 38 students. The respondents supported this idea of implementing online learning for English subject and had their personal reasons. Overall perceptions of the online learning were positive. The majority of students in the online learning indicated that they would prefer if the approach was offered. Therefore, this research found that online learning for English subject was applicable in Binus University. © 2020, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

In addition, this paper reflected upon the problems in the implementation of hybrid learning in higher education setting. Hybrid learning approach recently turns out to be an attractive mode of delivery to many learners because it does not only provide the convenience of a primarily-online course, but also permits meetings with lecturer in person. This was quantitative research and used the quasi-experimental approach. The sample consisted of 265 first-year undergraduates taking English course at one of private universities in Jakarta. The experimental group used the hybrid learning whereas the control group conventional learning. The instrument used in this research was post-test. Data from post-test was analyzed using t-test. Based on the t-test, null hypothesis was accepted. The result indicated that there was no significant difference between learners' learning performance in their listening and reading skills and two approaches using both traditional face-to-face learning and blended learning. One of the hybrid learning main consideration was the importance of transparent syllabus in the hybrid learning implementation. © 2019 IEEE.","conventional learning; hybrid learning; language learning performance; reading and listening skills","Computers; Classroom settings; English languages; Experimental approaches; Experimental groups; Face-to-face learning; Hybrid learning approach; Learning performance; Quantitative research; Computer science",,,,,,"Alebaikan, R., Troudi, S., Blended learning in saudi universities: Challenges and perspectives (2010) ALT-J Research in Learning Technology, 18 (1), pp. 49-59; Gomez, J., Igado, M., Blended learning: The key to success in a training company (2008) International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning, 5 (8); Eddy, L.J., Nor-Aziah, A., Jasmine, J., Blended learning: Examining concepts and practices (2014) Blended & Flipped Learning: Case Studies in Malaysian HEIs, E.

In a different context such as foreign language learning, a study by Cox and Davies (2012) found that such technology could be used to predict the speaking competency of a group of students for a language training program. To extend the context of the study, we investigated whether the online speech recognition technology would show impacts in helping EFL students’ language competency in two skills: Speaking and Writing. In our experimental—observation study, an online speech recognition technology, https://dictation.io/ was used as medium for students to give a small talk about assigned topics used in English high stake tests and have it transcribed the talk into texts. The nature of speaking and writing of the online application made it possible for us to analyze both the spoken and written expressions that students used. The students’ responses were then evaluated through the range of vocabulary and expressions they used, their fluency in expressing ideas and their accuracy in producing the sentences.

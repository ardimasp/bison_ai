This condition was supported by increasing use of smartphones which have been embedded a wireless technology such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and other latest technologies in its development. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) has become one of candidate wireless technologies for IPS implementation. Many researchers have carried out various studies on indoor positioning and localization using BLE technologies. However, most of studies still focus on how to find the methods and algorithms that can be used to obtain distance and accuracy, few specifically focus on the scheme and placement of BLE. Therefore, this research was conducted to find the most optimal scheme and placement of BLE. In this paper is proposed a scheme by combining placement of BLE using the fingerprinting and weighted sum method. The proposed scheme reduces the number of mean of error by 3.0 m compared to normal localization scheme. © 2020 ISSN 1881-803X.","Bluetooth low energy (BLE); Fingerprinting localization; Indoor positioning; Weighted sum",,,,,,"Dedes, G., Dempster, A.G., Indoor GPS positioning - Challenges and opportunities (2005) IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference, pp. 412-415. , https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECF.2005.1557943; Pu, Y.C., You, P.C., Indoor positioning system based on BLE location fingerprinting with classification approach (2018) Applied Mathematical Modelling, 62, pp. 654-663. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2018.06.031; Ren, A., Zhou, F., Rahman, A., Wang, X., Zhao, N., Yang, X., A study of indoor positioning based on UWB base-station configurations (2017) Proc.

DPC practically implemented new tax return processing system to replace the old system, however the performance of the new system was not on a par with the old one, at the beginning. Then, DPC made several improvements to increase new system's performance. This study aims to measure the improvements made by DPC by using Six Sigma approach. The approach is functioned to assess data processing performance through DMAIC concept: i.e. define, measure, analyse, improve, and control. With the DMAIC concept, improvement exposes better result, the average value of six sigma significantly escalated by 0.97 to 2.56. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data handling; Process engineering; Process monitoring; Risk management; Systems engineering; Taxation; Work simplification; Average values; Indonesia; Performance measurements; Processing performance; Processing systems; Six sigma approaches; System's performance; Tax returns; Six sigma",,,,,"Kaushik, P., Khanduja, D., (2009) Total Qual.

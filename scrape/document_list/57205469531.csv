This research proposes a model of effort estimation for web-based mobile application developed using object oriented approach. In the proposed model, functional size measurement of object oriented based web application named OOmFPWeb, web metric and mobile characteristic for web-based mobile application size measurement are combnined. The estimation process is done by using mamdani fuzzy logic method. To evaluate the proposed model, the comparison between OOmFPWeb as the variable that affect effort estimation for web-based mobile application and the proposed model are performed. The evaluation result shows that effort estimation for web-based mobile application with the proposed model is better than just using OOmFPWeb. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Functional; Fuzzy logic; Hypermedia; Mobile application effort estimation",,,,,,"Rao, D.M., (2012) Mobile Southeast Asia Report, , Mobile Monday; Schwalbe, K., Information Technology: Project Management (2010) Course Technology, pp. 8-9. , 6th Edition ed., C Learning, Ed., Boston; Mendes, E.N., Mosley, S.C., Investigating Early Web Size Measures for Web Cost Estimation (2003) Procedings of the EASE' 2003 Conference, pp. 1-22; Abrahao, S., Poels, G., A Family of Experiment to Evaluate a Fuctional Size Measurement Procedure for Web Applications (2009) Journal of Systems and Software, 82 (2), pp. 253-269; Souza, L.S., Aquino, G.S., Jr., Estimating the Effort of Mobile Application Development (2014) CS & IT, pp. 45-63; Shepperd, M., Schofield, C., Kitchenham, B., Effort Estimation Using Analogy (1996) Proceeding of ICSE-18; Myrtveit, I., Stensrud, E., A Controller Experiment to Assess the Benefits of Estimating with Analogy and Regression Model (1999) IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering, 25 (4), pp. 510-525; Shepperd, M.J., Schofield, C., Estimating Software Project Effort Using Analogies (1997) IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering, 23 (11), pp. 736-743; Suharjito, S., Jimmy, J., Girsang, A.S., Mobile Decision Support System to Determine Toddler's Nutrition Using Fuzzy Sugeno (2017) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE), 7 (6), pp. 3683-3691; Lubis, A.J., Susanto, E., Sunarya, U., Implementation of Maximum Power Point Tracking on Photovoltaic Using Fuzzy Logic Algorithm (2015) TELKOMNIKA (Telecommunication Computing Electronics and Control), 13 (1), pp. 32-40; Sharma, V., Verma, H.K., Optimized Fuzzy Logic Based Framework for Effort Estimation in Software Development (2010) IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science, 7 (2), pp. 30-38; Kumar, N.V.R.S., Mandala, A., Chaitanya, M.V., Prasad, G., Fuzzy Logic for Software Effort Estimation Using Polynomial Regression as Firing Interval (2011) IJCTA, pp. 1843-1847; Prasad, P.R., Sudha, K.R., Rama, P.R., Application of Fuzzy Logic Approach to Software Effort Estimation (2011) IJACSA International Journal of Advance Computer Science and Application, 2 (5), pp. 87-92; Malathi, S., Sridhar, D.S., Optimization of Fuzzy Analogy in Software Cost Estimation Using Lingustic Variables (2012) Procedia Engineering, 32, pp. 177-190; Ziauddin, S., Kamal, S., Khan, J.A.N., A Fuzzy Logic Based Software Cost Estimation Model (2013) International Journal of Software Engineering and Its Application, 7, pp. 7-18; Suharjito, S., Nanda, B.S., Modeling software effort estimation using hybrid PSO-ANFIS (2016) Int.

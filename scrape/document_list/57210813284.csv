Furthermore, this study also explores the millennials’ perception towards digital technology adoption for museum. Taman Mini Indonesia Indah website was employed to remark the research object. Hence, 18 museums were finalized as of this research object. Data was accumulated through direct field observation in all museums and interview with museum staff. Meanwhile, a survey with questionnaire was distributed to gather the digital technology and accessible information perception of the museum. Also, other accessibility information data was gathered through content analysis. The findings reveal accessible information compliance in term of printed material, digital document, audio visual content, website, application, self-service terminal, and signage. Findings also show that Museum Olahraga turns out to be the most compliance regarding its accessible information and providing digitalization facilities such as interactive digital signage, augmented reality, interactive video mapping, automatic display slider, interactive kiosk, and interactive light show. However, the result shows that only several museums comply with digital context. This research implication is to deliver the best practice for the museum to anticipate future trends to ensure better experiences for the visitors. © 2020 by ASERS® Publishing.

With many tourists, both local and foreign, visiting tourism areas in Indonesia, will likely always bring more income to the country. With more and more people traveling and most of them having special needs, such as the elderly, young children, pregnant women, people with permanent and temporary disabilities, it is important that tourism objects must be fulfilling the standard from UNWTO concerning the idea that tourism must be felt by everyone or what is known as 'Tourism for All', including information dissemination. In the tourism industry information can be a determinant factor whether a tourist who comes to a tourist destination will feel satisfied or not. Through the information, all things about attractions can be conveyed to prospective visitors or visitors. Therefore, this study aims to determine the extent to which Taman Mini Indonesia Indah implements accessible information for tourism. In this study using descriptive qualitative methods, the primary data was obtained through field research during the period of January-March 2019. The results obtained are an overall picture of the information available in each tourist attraction at Taman Mini Indonesia Indah which is explained into seven categories, namely: printed material, digital document, audiovisual content, websites, apps, cell-service terminals, and signage. The overall conclusion is that Taman Mini Indonesia Indah still needs to improve the accessible information made available for tourism according to desired standards so that it complies with the standards of the UNWTO. This is especially for the apps and self-service terminal categories. It is expected that if accessible information for tourism is increased, visitors to the Taman Mini Indonesia Indah will increase, especially the number of visitors from abroad and this is important for tourism sustainability. © 2019 AJHTL.","Accessible information; Disabilities; Taman mini Indonesia Indah; Tourism; Tourist destination",,,,,"Binus University","This research acknowledges for Bina Nusantara University Grant Research 2019 and another researcher in the same field.","Adiati, M.P., Lestari, N.S., Wiastuti, R.D., (2018) Public parks as urban tourism in Jakarta, , Medan, IOP Publisher; Altinay, Z., The Role of Social Media Tools: Accessible Tourism for Disabled Citizens (2016) Journal of Educational Technology & Society, 19 (1), pp. 89-99; Buj, C., (2010) Paving the Way to Accessible Tourism.

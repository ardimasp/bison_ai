This game will be made to be played in a personal computer (PC). The pictures used are 2D pictures with 2D animation and audio to attract students to play the game and learn mathematics. There are 4 mini games which will be developed based on the previous research. The data collection methods used were questionnaires, literature studies, interviews, and game trials. Results show that students prefer to learn mathematics while playing game. This game has been tested by primary students and runs smoothly. The materials delivered by the game are also easily understood by students. At the end of this research, it is expected that this educational mathematics game will become an alternative media which will complement the conventional learning method. © 2017 IEEE.","elementary students; games education; mathematics educational game","Animation; Computer games; Information management; Personal computers; Surveys; 2D animation; Data collection method; Educational game; Elementary students; Learning methods; Literature studies; Mathematics games; Students",,,,,"Aprilia, N., (2014) Peran Pembelajaran Kelas Alam Dalam Meningkatkan Prestasi Belajar Siswa Mata Pelajaran Fikih Kelas X MA Bilingual YPPM Al Manah Krian Sidoarjo; Bernier, F., Enhancing stress management skills in military personnel using biofeedback (2011) Journal of CyberTherapy and Rehabilitation, 209; De Kloet, E.R., Stress and the brain: From adaptation to disease (2005) Nat.

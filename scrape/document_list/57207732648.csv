The purposes of this research are to analyze and evaluate the process of enterprise architecture that should be performed periodically to ensure the role of the IT Department in line with the demands that the company needs. Methods of this research conducted to analyze and evaluate enterprise architecture at PT Eonchemicals with EA3 Cubes. In the end, the conclusions from these research as follows several initiatives strengthen business strategy, such as the need to utilize the Machine Learning, Online Test Recruitment, Learning Path on training modules, and adding information cost/operational expense on the dashboard of the new area determination. Measurement using Information Technology Balance Scorecard (IT BSC) has average value 72.33% with four perspectives such as company contribution, user orientation, operational perfection and future orientation with scores 81%, 78.3%, 67.5% and 62.5% respectively. © 2018 IEEE.","Decision Making; EA3; Enterprise Architecture; Strategic Planning","Competition; Decision making; E-learning; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Strategic planning; Balance scorecard; Business competition; Business strategy; Company's strategy; Enterprise Architecture; Future orientations; Information costs; Training modules; Information use",,,,,"Woodworth, P., (2013) A Reference Architecture for Enterprise Architecture, Sydney: Jera Editing Services; Widjajanto, N., (2001) Sistem Informasi Akutansi, Jakarta: Penerbit Erlangga; Ward, J., Peppard, J., (2002) Strategic Planning for Information Systems, , Third Edition, Chichester: John Wiley and Sons, Ltd; Vercellis, C., (2009) Business Intelligence: Data Mining and Optimization for Decision Making, , Italy: A John Wiley and Sons, Ltd., Publication; Veneberg, R., Enterprise architecture intelligence combining enterprise architecture and operational data (2014) 2014 IEEE 18th International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference, , Netherlands; Safeer, M., (2011) Impact of Business Intelligence Competency Center in Success/Failure of B.I.

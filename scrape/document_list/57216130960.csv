This condition will have an impact on the psychological aspects of the sufferer, namely distress which will affect their quality of life. General Design Guidance in Health Building Notes explains the need to consider an environment that can have an impact on the recovery of patients and medical members, and provide a quality environment that provides positive care for patient care and vice versa. The aim of this study was the design of the main breast cancer clinic that applied the therapeutic environment in helping to cure this medical and psychological illness based on Health Building Records, as well as descriptive and qualitative protection. The results of the study were the space requirements that help patients to get medical assistance to improve the quality of life for cancer patients. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","breast cancer; clinic; Therapeutic","Architectural design; Patient rehabilitation; Breast Cancer; clinic; General designs; Psycho-social effects; Psychological Aspects; Quality of life; Space requirements; Therapeutic; Diseases",,,,,"Wulandari, N., Overview of Quality of Life in Patients with Breast Cancer at Bahteramas General Hospital, Southeast Sulawesi Province (2017) Jurnal Ilmiah Mahasiswa Kesehatan Masyarakat, pp. 1-9; Cleese, J., (2010) What You Should Know about Breast Cancer; Massie, M.J., Prevalence of Depression in Patient with Cancer (2004) Journal of the National Cancer Institute Monographs, 2004 (32), pp. 57-71; IARC 2018 Goblocan Access, , https://gco.iarc.fr/, International Agency for Research on Cancer; (2013) Basic Health Research Riskesdes, , Health research and development agency of the Ministry of Health Republic Indonesia; Ulrich, R.S., Stress Recovery during Exposure to Natural and Urban Environments (1991) Science Direct, 11 (3), pp. 201-230; (2014) Health Building Note 00-01: General Design Guidance for Healthcare Buildings, , Department of Health; (2014) Permenkes No 9 Tahun 2014, , Ministry of Health Republic Indonesia; Polat, A.T., Gungor, S., Demir, M., Design principles of therapeutic gardens (2017) International Journal of Landscape Architectural Research, 1, pp. 37-42; Ivarsson, C.T., Grahn, P., Patients' experiences and use of a therapeutic garden: From a designer's perspective| Patients' experiences and use of a therapeutic garden: From designer's perspective (2010) Schweizerische Zeitschrift für Forstwesen, 161 (3), pp. 104-113; Smith, R., Watkins, N., (2016) Therapeutic Environments, , https://www.wbdg.org/resources/therapeutic-environments; (2014) Health Building Note 02-01: Cancer Treatment Facilities, , Department of Health; (2017) Guide to Management of Breast Cancer, , Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia; (2017) National Guidelines of Medical Services for Breast Cancer Management, , Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia","Bobby Saragih, J.F.; Architecture Department, Bina Nusantara University, Indonesia; email: BSaragih@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

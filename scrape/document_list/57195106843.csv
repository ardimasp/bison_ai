The quality of IT service is also needed to provide an information system that matches with a university's needs. As a result, evaluations need to be conducted towards IT services in fulfilling the needs and providing satisfaction for information systems users. The purpose of this paper was to conduct a synthesis of the service work performance provided by the IT Division towards information systems users by using systematic literature review. The methodology used in this research was a literature study related with a COBIT and ITIL framework, as well as finding the interrelatedness between service managements toward an increase of IT work performance. © 2017 IEEE.","COBIT; IT service; ITIL; performance management; SLR; systematic literature review","Information systems; Information use; COBIT; IT services; ITIL; Performance management; Systematic literature review; Information management",,,,,"Abreu, J., Martin, P.V., Fernandes, S., Zacarias, M., Business processes improvement on maintenance management: A case study (2013) CENTERIS 2013-Conference on Enterprise Information Systems/PRojMAN 2013-International Conference on Project Management/HCIST 2013-International Conference on Health and Social Care Information Systems and Technologies, Procedia Technology, 9, pp. 320-330; Addy, R., (2007) Effective IT Service Management: To ITIL and Beyond!, , 1st ed., Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, Germany; Ahmad, N., Technology adoption model and a road map to successful implementation of ITIL (2013) Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 26 (5), pp. 553-576; Alfaraj, H.M., Qin, S., Operationalising CMMI: Integrating CMMI and CoBIT perspective (2011) Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology, 9 (3), pp. 323-335; Bartens, Y., Schulte, F., Voß, S., E-business IT governance revisited: An attempt towards outlining a novel Bi-directional Business/IT alignment in COBIT5 (2014) 2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Science, , 10.1109; Blokdijk, G., (2008) ITIL IT Service management-100 Most Asked Questions on IT Service Management and ITIL Foundation Certification, Training and Exams, , Emereo Publishing, Queensland; Van Bon, J., (2002) The Guide to IT Service Management, 1. , PearsonEducation Limited., United Kingdom; Cartlidge, A., Hanna, A., Rudd, C., Macfarlane, I., Windebank, J., Rance, S., (2007) An Introductory Overview of ITIL® V3 Version 1.0, , The UK Chapter of the ITSMF; Cervone, F., ITIL: A framework for managing digital library services (2008) OCLC Systems & Services: International Digital Library Perspectives, 24 (2), p. 87; Den Hertog, P., Knowledge-intensive business services as CoProducers of innovation (2000) International Journal of Innovation Management, 4 (4), pp. 491-528; Esteves, R., Alves, P., Implementation of an information technology infrastructure library process - The resistance to change (2013) CENTERIS 2013-Conference on Enterprise Information Systems/PRojMAN 2013-International Conference on Project Management/HCIST 2013-International Conference on Health and Social Care Information Systems and Technologies, Procedia Technology, 9, pp. 505-510; Harej, K., Horvat, R.V., Customer relationship management momentum for business improvement (2004) Proceedings of 26th International Conference on Information Technology Interfaces, pp. 107-111. , Cavtat, Croasia, IEEE; Huang, Z., Zavarsky, P., Ruhl, R., An efficient framework for IT controls of bill 198 (Canada sarbanes-oxley) compliance by aligning COBIT 4.1, ITIL v3 and ISO/IEC 27002 (2009) 2009 International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering, , 10.1109; (2007) COBIT: The IT Governance Institute, , IT Governance Institute; Kess, P., (2009) Critical Factors for An Effective Business Value Chain.

Therefore, they will be ready to contend and to be an ambitious individual in the real world. All graduates are judged by their Grade Point Average (GPA). Therefore, in Indonesia, it is critical to maintaining a good GPA from the first semester until the graduation. Although the student is the main actor, it is not only their job to maintain the GPA. The good-grade university also needs to participate by helping them to get the best help and environment during the lecture. The university should able to create conducive learning environment to support and to help undergraduate students in maintaining a good GPA. The purposes of this paper are to identify and analyze the factors that affect a good performance of student's GPA, to give suggestions to education institution as a preventive action of low performance of student's GPA, and to design a successful model to achieve good GPA. Methodologies used in this paper are literature study, analysis at the University, model trial, and giving the result and solutions. © 2016 IEEE.","GPA; Grade Point Average; graduate; undergraduate students;

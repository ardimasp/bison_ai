Nevertheless, because of the lack of literature on the smart IPO framework, we refer to smart government and smart city framework. The aim of this paper is to propose a framework for smart IPO in developing countries in the context of smart city framework. The study found that smart IPO composed of several components such as 1) Smart IPO Model; 2) Smart IPO Enterprise Architecture; 3) Smart IPO Collaboration Model; 4) Smart IPO Development Model; 5) Smart IPO Measurement Model; 6) Smart IPO Standard; and 7) Smart IPO Services. It also found that there are four models of IP office as follows: Model 1 (basic web-based, public services); Model 2 (advanced internal administration); Model 3 (full process automation); and Model 4 (knowledge-based IP services). Moreover, we found also three stages of IP development model: Stage 1 (automation of internal processes); Stage 2 (web-based e-services); Stage 3 (e-dossier, e-filing, e-payment). © 2019 The Authors.","IP office; IT governance; Smart IP office framework","Developing countries; Information use; Knowledge based systems; Patents and inventions; Public administration; Smart city; Websites; Collaboration models; Computer-implemented Inventions; Economic development; Enterprise Architecture; IP office; IT governance; Smart IP office framework; Theoretical framework; Internet protocols",,,,,"What is intellectual property?

One of the impacts from the growth of it, there is the revolution in a traditional market. Nowadays, people tend to buy something through an online channel or electronic marketplace (e-marketplace). This study aims to obtain literature of key success factors of e-marketplace implementation. It uses Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to articles published in 2005-2018. A total of 231 articles obtain from considerable databases for instance: IEEE Explore, ACM Digital Library, Science Direct and etc. Furthermore, it validates and examines in order to obtain 37 articles which can be used as the main study. As the result, it finds 11 key success factors for e-marketplace as follows: Trust, technical, platform, platform owner, product, service operation, seller, marketing and sales, payment channel, buyer, and environmental. © 2018 IEEE.","e-marketplace;

As a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Indonesia conducted major amendments to its patent laws, trademark laws and copyright laws in 1997 in accordance with the TRIPS Agreement. Later on, an industrial design law, a trade secret law, and a semiconductor-integrated circuit law were established in 2000. The patent laws and the trademark laws were amended in 2001, while the copyright laws were amended in 2002. The Directorate General of Intellectual Property Rights (DGIPR) is a government office under the Ministry of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia which is responsible for the registration and protection of intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyright, industrial designs, layout designs of integrated circuits and trade secrets. The DGIPR is also responsible for disseminating information on intellectual property (IP). Indonesia is one of the largest archipelago countries in the world and which has 33 provinces. Currently many people residing in these provinces find it difficult to obtain IP related information, such as: flagship trademarks, patent research or geographical indication of product from a province. At the same time there is currently no application or system in Indonesia that provides IP-based mobile information services. The aim of this study is to develop a system that disseminates the IPR information based on location of the IPR for mobile users. This system is also being integrated with social networks such as Facebook and twitter. © 2013 IIJ.","Intellectual Property; Location Awareness; Mobile User",,,,,,"Kumagai, K., (2008), p. 42. , Intellectual Property Systems in Asian Countries: Japan Patent Office - Asia-Pacific Industrial Property Center, JIII; (2011), p. 29. , DGIPR Team, DGIPR Review Study on Development of Automation System, Tangerang: DGIPR; Mantoro, T., Johnson, C., Location History in a Low-cost Context Awareness Environment (2003) ACSW frontiers, 21, pp. 153-158; Schmidt, A., (2002), p. 294. , PhD Thesis, Ubiquitous Computing - Computing in Context, November, Lancaster University; Taipan, M., Lape, M., Finding Your Way with KLAS, A Look into a Location Aware System (2011), Technical Report ECE.P54.2009.1.

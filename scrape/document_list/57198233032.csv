Those documents exist not only in a paper based but also in an electronic based. It can be seen from the data sample taken by the SpringerLink publisher in 2010, which showed an increase in the number of digital document collections from 2003 to mid of 2010. Then, how to manage them well becomes an important need. This paper describes a new method in managing documents called as inverted files system. Related with the electronic based document, the inverted files system will closely used in term of its usage to document so that it can be searched over the Internet using the Search Engine. It can improve document search mechanism and document save mechanism. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,"Moore, W., Maccreery, N., Marlow, M., (2010) Usage Measurements for Digital Content, , SpringerLink; Baeza-Yates, R., Ribeiro-Neto, B., (1999) Modern Information Retrieval, , Addison Wesley, USA; Neve, G., Orio, N., (2004) Indexing and Retrieval of Music Documents Through Pattern Analysis and Data Fusion Techniques, , Universitat Pompeu Fabra; Liddy, E., (2005) Document Retrieval, Automatic, Encyclopedia of Language & Linguistics; Lu, G., (1999) Multimedia Management Database Systems, , Artech House Inc., Boston, London; Carmel, D., Cohen, D., Fagin, R., Frachi, E., Herscovici, M., Maarek, Y.S., Soffer, A., Static index pruning for information retrieval systems (2001) Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 43-50. , New Orleans, LA; Garcia, S., Williams, H.E., Cannane, A., Estivill-Castro, V., Access-ordered indexes (2004) Proceedings of the Australasian Computer Science Conference, pp. 7-14. , Dunedin, New Zealand., Ed.

Including financial, academic process, business management, and technology. In supporting a more dynamic learning system in the low to the middle education sector, this paper is present in conveying its purpose to build an integrated system design using Business Process Management (BPM) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) which refers to the System Literature Review (SLR) method for School Management Systems (SMS) that will be implemented as core activities school and have an impact on improving the performance of human and student resources. The design of an integrated school management system architecture between SOA and BPM is a result obtained based on the proposed solution. Therefore, unorganized school management can be overcome by a combination of the two proposed approaches. © International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

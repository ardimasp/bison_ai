As the industrial 4.0 concepts has revolved and visible components have surfaced, this paper will use a systematic literature review methodology to assert the crucial elements of manufacturing industries in GIS and Industrial 4.0 concepts for providing a resolution in improving manufacturing industries. In addition, Arcgis online would be used to create a visualization of the proposed map design that shows the potentiality to solve current concerns of manufacturing industries in Bekasi. Along with the evolution of industrial 4.0, it is crucial to grasp on the idea on how to wisely integrate GIS and manufacturing industry location data in-order to track industries sites and monitor activity data ubiquitously. We conclude the analytical elements supported by the evidence and also a proposed map design which could aid the complex decision making and site location tracking of manufacturing industries in Indonesia. By doing this research, the motivation is to convince GIS contribution to manufacturing industry evolution, there are more reasons and evidence to implement GIS to adapt to the current developing industrial 4.0. For further research purposes, this prestudy is the initiation of manufacturing future foresight. © 2019 IEEE.","bekasi; geographical information system; Indonesia; industry 4.0; manufacturing industry; map design","Decision making; Geographic information systems; Industry 4.0; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Maps; bekasi; Complex decision; Indonesia; Literature reviews; Manufacturing industries; Map design; Research purpose; Systematic literature review; Industrial research",,,,,"(2018) Revolusi Industri 4. 0, , https://modengkara.net/revolusi-industri-4-0, Modengkara; Rauf, M.F., (2018) Internet of Things (IoT) Dalam Revolusi Industri 4. 0, , Medium, 29-May; Looking Back at 2017: Indonesia's Manufacturing Industry | Indonesia Investments, , https://www.Indonesiainvestments.com/business/business-columns/looking-back-at-2017-Indonesia-s-manufacturing-industry/item8441, [Accessed: 23-May-2019]; Jun, C., (2000) Design of An Intelligent Geographic Information System for Multi-criteria Site Analysis, 12 (3), p. 13; Gae Luna, N., Revolusi Industri Dan Indonesia 4. 0, , https://kumparan.com/nona-gaeluna1519199971381/revolusi-industri-dan-Indonesia-4-0, kumparan.

The methods used include the method of analysis in the form of literature and field studies to observe the activities of the running system, interviews with stakeholders, user surveys and design method using the Unified Modelling Language, and design the system architecture and features. The result of this research is the development of the library system by implementing an integrated flow of circulation of books between libraries. The conclusions of this research is toimplement an integrated book circulationbetween libraries, then the inter-library loan can be done in an integrated manner. © 2015 The Authors.

Methods: An exploratory qualitative study was conducted. In-depth semi-structured interviews were undertaken involving four CAPD patients who were selected through purposive sampling. The participants were asked questions about their engagement experiences with their health care professionals. Results: Six main engagement activities were derived from the interview analysis: obtaining initial knowledge, developing knowledge and skills, feeling confident, following clinical advice, updating health condition, and supporting CAPD therapy. Conclusion: Patients engagement activities played an important role in CAPD therapy. The engagement activities covered the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions. Obtaining initial knowledge as well as developing knowledge and skills are essential engagement activities before patients perform CAPD therapy. © 2019 Darmayanti et al.","CAPD; Exploratory pilot study; Health care professionals; Patient engagement","adult; article; case report; clinical article; continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis; female; human; human tissue; male; pilot study; qualitative research; sampling; semi structured interview; skill",,,,,"Jha, V., Garcia-Garcia, G., Iseki, K., Chronic kidney disease: Global dimension and perspectives (2013) Lancet., 382 (9888), pp. 260-272; Wearne, N., Kilonzo, K., Effa, E., Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: Perspectives on patient selection in low- to middle-income countries (2017) Int J Nephrol Renovasc Dis., 10, pp. 1-9; Neuen, B.L., Chadban, S.J., Demaio, A.R., Johnson, D.W., Perkovic, V., Chronic kidney disease and the global NCDS agenda (2017) BMJ Glob Health., 2 (2), pp. e000380-e000384; Hill, N.R., Fatoba, S.T., Oke, J.L., Global Prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (2016) PLoS One., 11 (7), p. e0158765; KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (2013) Kidney International Supplements., 3 (1), pp. i-xiii and 1-150. , https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KDIGO_2012_CKD_GL.pdf, Available from; Saxena, R., West, C., Peritoneal dialysis: A primary care perspective (2006) J Am Board Fam Med., 19 (4), pp. 380-389; Fleming, G.M., Renal replacement therapy review: Past, present and future (2011) Organogenesis., 7 (1), pp. 2-12; (2018) Riset Kesehatan Dasar, Riskedas 2013, Badan Penelitian dan Pengembangan Kesehatan, Kementrian Keseharan Republik Indonesia [National Institute of Health Research and Development, Basic Health Survey], , http://www.depkes.go.id/resources/download/general/Hasil%20Riskesdas%202013.pdf, Available from, Accessed December 19, Indonesian; (2018) Badan Penelitian dan Pengembangan Kesehatan, Kementerian Kesehatan Republik Indonesia [National Institute of Health Research and Development, Basic Health Survey], , http://www.kesmas.kemkes.go.id/assets/upload/dir_519d41d8cd98f00/files/Hasil-riskesdas-2018_1274.pdf, Available from, Accessed February 6, Indonesian; (2017) 10th Report of Indonesian Renal Registry, , https://www.indonesianrenalregistry.org/data/IRR%202017%20.pdf, Available from, Accessed December 19, Indonesian; Novelia, E., Nugraha, R.R., Thabrany, H., Cost effectiveness analysis between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis (2017) Jurnal Ekonomi Kesehatan Indonesia., 1 (3), pp. 120-125; Prodjosudjadi, W., Incidence, prevalence, treatment and cost of end-stage renal disease in Indonesia (2006) Ethn Dis., 16, pp. S2-14; The development of a continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis program in Indonesia (2008) Peritoneal Dialysis Int., 28 (3), pp. S59-S62; Afiatin, K.L.C., Kristin, E., Economic evaluation of policy options for dialysis in end-stage renal disease patients under the universal health coverage in Indonesia (2017) PLoS One., 12 (5), p. e0177436; Solusi Terapi Penderita Gagal Ginjal?

Methods: Simple Linear Regression is used to test the relationship between brand heritage as an independent variable and cognitive brand strength, affective brand strength, and intentional brand strength as dependent variables. An independent t-test is used to examine if there are differences between the customers who purchase luxury goods with regard to brand heritage. And the last is ANOVA to check if there are any significant differences in brand heritage with regards to the age, expenditure, and education level of the respondents. Results: brand heritage does have a positive impact on the cognitive brand strength, affective brand strength and intentional brand strength on the customers of these luxury brands. The independent t-test revealed that there is a significant difference between the customers of the two items bags and watches with regard to the brand heritage. ANOVA tests revealed that there is no significant difference between brand heritage and age, gender, expenditure, and income level of the respondents. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

In addition, this paper also examines whether there are differences among the four variables above in demographic factors. Convenience sampling was used to conduct the survey. There were 150 respondents who took the survey in Jakarta and Surabaya, Indonesia. A 4 point Likert Scale was adopted and data analysis was performed using Regression analysis, ANOVA and an Independent T- test. There was a positive relationship between Attitudinal Loyalty towards Repeat Patronage Intention. However, Perceived Service Quality and Corporate Social Responsibility were not positively related with Repeat Patronage Intention. Furthermore, there was a different outcome in age group on Perceived Service Quality and Corporate Social Responsibility and a significance difference in perception of Corporate Social Responsibility within the education level group. The banking industry should have a strategic plan which includes the role of Corporate Social Responsibility and sincerely implement the plan as Corporate Social Responsibility is one of the variable that can enhance the Perceived Service Quality, Attitudinal Loyalty and Repeat Patronage Intention. Further study could expand to other service industries such as the hotel and tourism and conduct in other cities in Indonesia besides Jakarta and Surabaya.","Attitudinal loyalty; Corporate social responsibility; Jakarta and surabaya; Perceived service quality; Repeat patronage",,,,,,"(2013) 'Keeping up with Indonesia's fickle consumers', , http://www.asianewsnet.net/news-35559.html, Asian News Network, March 10, 2013; (2013) 'Laporan Pengawasan Perbankan (LPP) 2011', , http://www.bi.go.id/NR/rdonlyres/1AD2B012-5F0F-4F51-8FD2-CB1D763C80CA/26126/LPP2011_Final.pdf, Bank Indonesia, March 13, 2013; (2012) 'Undang-Undang Republik Indonesia nomor 40 tahun 2007 tentang perseroan terbatas', , http://aria.bapepam.go.id/reksadana/files/regulasi/UU%2040%202007%20Perseroan%20Terbatas.pdf, BAPEPAMLK, March 9, 2013; Berens, G., Van Riel, C.B.M., Van Bruggen, G.H., 'Corporate association and consumer product responses: the moderating role of corporate brand dominance' (2005) Journal of Marketing, 69, pp. 35-48. , July; Caroll, A.B., 'The pyramid of corporate social responsibility: toward the moral management of organizational stakeholders' (1991) Business Horizons, pp. 39-48. , July August; Chaudhuri, A., Holbrook, M.B., 'The chain of effect from brand trust and brand affect to brand performance: the role of brand loyalty' (2001) Journal of Marketing, 65, pp. 81-93. , April; Chiou, J.S., Droge, C., 'Service quality, trust, specific asset investment, and expertise: direct and indirect effects in a satisfaction-loyalty framework' (2006) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 34 (4), pp. 613-627; Dick, A., Basu, K., 'Customer loyalty: toward an integrated conceptual, framework' (1994) Journal of Academy of Marketing Science, 22 (2), pp. 99-113; Freeman, R.E., Evan, W.M., 'Corporate Governance: A stakeholder interpretation' (1990) Journal of Behavioral Economics, 19, pp. 337-359; (2013) '10 bank peraih best bank service excellence 2012', , http://www.infobanknews.com/2012/05/ini-dia-10-bank-peraih-best-bank-service-excellence-2012/, InfoBankNews, March 29; (2013) '10 bank yang memiliki nasabah paling loyal tahun 2011', , http://www.infobanknews.com/2011/01/10-bank-yang-memiliki-nasabah-tabungan-paling-loyal/, InfoBankNews, March 23; Jain, A.K., Pinson, C., Malhotra, N.K., 'Customer loyalty as a construct in the marketing of banking services' (1987) International Journal of Bank Marketing, 5 (3), pp. 49-72; Lewis, B.R., Soureli, M., 'The antecedents of consumer loyalty in retail banking' (2006) Journal of consumer Behavior, 5, pp. 15-31; Lovelock, C.H., Wirtz, J., Chew, P., (2009) 'Essentials of Services Marketing', , Prentice Hall, Pearson Education South Asia Pte.

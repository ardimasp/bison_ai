Glucose tests generally only require a small sample of blood using a sterile needle from the glucometer. The sufferer may feel pain due to a pin prick. However, not all diabetics can do glucose tests regarding having a great fear of syringes, especially in older patients. Therefore, in this work, the diabetic detection system with the retina is an alternative for early checking of patients without having to take a sample of the blood patient. The Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) is used to extract the signal, in which the extracted the retina image is later used as input to the artificial neural network (ANN) based identifier. The retina image parameters are compared and classified to identify the human retina that are intended to be performed. The results of the computer simulation show that this technique produces good accuracy 100% and 96.6%, for training and testing phases, respectively. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Foundation, W.

In the era of development, there are so many roads extensions to balance the significant additions of motorized vehicles. The increasing number of vehicles caused problems such as damaged roads and lack of maintenance to the road itself. Lack of awareness to repair the damaged roads, especially potholes, make it more dangerous for riders to drive safely. This issues are more concerning right now because the increasing number of accident and mortality. To prevent accident to happen, the pothole detection sensor can be used to on car system. The development of pothole detection sensor in this research is adopted from the proximity sensor system where in that system they use camera and digital imaging process. The advantages from our system that we research and develop are more user friendly from the feasibility and the financial aspect. Low cost sensor with the same quality of the existing system is devlop in this work. Despite the use of low cost sensor, the maintenance also on the lower cost and easier to do. As the result of this research and study, an error was obtained between the distance that detected the pothole should be in less than 4% distance range from the sensor. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Accidents; Costs; Landforms; Motor transportation; Proximity sensors; Road vehicles; Roads and streets; Detection sensors; Detection system; Distance ranges; Existing systems; Financial aspects; Low-cost sensors; Motorized vehicles; Number of vehicles; Automobile safety devices",,,,,"Wibowo, A., (2010) Analisa Kecelakaan Lalu Lintas Pada Ruas Jalan Utama di Wilayah Kabupaten Sragen Tahun 2002-2006; Saputra, D., (2017) Studi Tingkat Kecelakaan Lalu Lintas Jalan di Indonesia Berdasarkan Data KNKT (Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi) Dari Tahun 2007-2016; Lin, J., Liu, Y., Potholes Detection Based on SVM in the Pavement Distress Image (2010) 2010 Ninth International Symposium on Distributed Computing and Applications to Business, Engineering and Science, p. 544; Joseph, S., ROLE of ULTRASONIC SENSOR in AUTOMATIC POTHOLE and HUMP DETECTION SYSTEM (2017) International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, 8, pp. 260-265; Madli, R., Hebbar, S., Pattar, P., Golla, V., Automatic Detection and Notification of Potholes and Humps on Roads to Aid Drivers (2015) IEEE Sensors Journal, 4313-4318; Yousaf, M.H., Azhar, K., Murtaza, F., Hussain, F., Visual analysis of ashalt pavement for detection and localization of potholes (2018) Advance Engineering Informatics, 88, pp. 524-537; Ouma, Y.O., Hahn, M., Pothole detection on asphalt pavements from 2D-colour potholes images using fuzzy c-means clustering and morphological reconstruction (2017) Automation in Construction, 83, pp. 196-211; Tedeschi, A., Benedetto, F., A real-time automatic pavement cracj andpothole recognition system for mobile Android-base devices (2017) Advance Engineering Infromatics, 32, pp. 11-15; Kim, T., Ryu, S.K., Review and analysis of pothole detection methods (2014) J.

By using force limiting (FL) feature, where the force of the arm robot is limited and controlled, the robot can sense collision and stop its movement when it occurs. The idea is to apply the mentioned concept for service purposes. In this research a 6-axis arm robot with collision detection is developed. The design of the arm robot adopted the design of Universal Robot's UR3 with each joint capable of 360° rotation. The design approach is chosen for its flexibility to work in tight space with a maximum reach of half meter, as it is intended to work closely with human. This initial version robot is not intended to carry heavy load or move at high precision. With a maximum load of one Kg, this arm robot targets numerous applications that help human to do complex repetitive tasks, extend the reach of human operators, and help humans on many daily chores that usually does not involve heavy loads. The whole frame, which also serve as the cover of the robot, was made by 3D printing with multiple materials that fit to the strength and temperature requirement at each part of the robot. In order to detect collision, the arm robot employed smart servos at each joint with the ability to detect overcurrent and overvoltage, which allow the implementation of force limiting (FL) feature that will stop the robot in case of collision. The resulting arm robot managed to lift1 kg load and able stop its movement in the event of collision. Future research to improve the movement precision of the arm robot by adaptive methods is promising. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","3D Printing; Arm robot; Collaborative; Force Limiting; Service Robot","3D printers; Mobile robots; 3-D printing; Adaptive methods; Collaborative; Collision detection; Design approaches; Force Limiting; Multiple materials; Service robots; Machine design",,,,,"Cherubini, A., Passama, R., Crosnier, A., Lasnier, A., Fraisse, P., Collaborative manufacturing with physical human-robot interaction (2016) Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 40, pp. 1-13; Matthias, B., Kock, S., Jerregard, H., Kallman, M., Lundberg, I., Safety of collaborative industrial robots: Certification possibilities for a collaborative assembly robot concept (2011) 2011 IEEE International Symposium on Assembly and Manufacturing (ISAM), p. 1; (2011) Robots and Robotic Devices-Safety Requirements for Industrial Robots-Part 1: Robots, ISO/CD 10218-1; (2016) Robots and Robotic Devices-Collaborative Robots, ISO/TS 15066; (2012) Robots and Robotic Devices - Vocabulary, ISO 8373; Kufieta, K., (2014); Sobron, L., Sutanto, D., Pengaruh Posisi Orientasi Objek Pada Proses Rapid Prototyping 3D Printing Terhadap Kekuatan Tarik Material Polymer (2016) Sinergi, 20 (3), p. 229; Thamrin, I., Analisa Tegangan-regangan Struktur Pegas Daun Akibat Modifikasi Penekanan (2009) Jurnal Rekayasa Mesin Universitas Sriwijaya",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The effectiveness in food processing becomes emerging in the food industry. The automatic fruit classification system is becoming important for use in many food processing industries. A novel approach for classifying, using support vector machines (SVM) is presented in this paper. Fruit classification based on their shape is proposed in this work. The system differentiates the fruit based on their shape. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is extracted and later used as input to the SVM-based identifier. The fruit parameters are compared and classified, the results of computer simulation show that this technique produces better accuracy than that of the existing technique that is based on artificial neural network (Ann). The SVM also requires less training time than artificial neural network (Ann). © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The proposed algorithm is also more global, capable in recognizing multiple lane markers and estimating the position of the vehicle on a multi-lane road.

The neurocontroller of interest is the best of an ecosystem of neurocontrollers that evolved according to the genetic algorithm. The chromosome of each individual neurocontroller is simply the binary weights of the connections, and the fitness function is a simple rule for obstacle avoidance behavior. To limit the hardware requirements, the neurocontroller's evolution is simulated in a computer, and the best neurocontroller behavior is analyzed in the simulation and in an actual mobile robot. Albeit a simple chromosome, the resulting best neurocontroller showed an obstacle avoidance behavior in both simulation and in the actual mobile robot, regardless of the positions of obstacles in the environment. The analysis of the chromosome after evolution also found that not all of the sensors are actually needed for the obstacle avoidance behavior. © 2013 IIJ.","Evolution; Genetic algorithm; Neural network; Neurocontroller; Reinforcement learning",,,,,,"Rumelhart, D.E., McClelland, J.L., (1986), 1. , and the PDP Research Group, Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition, Foundations, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Holland, J.H., (1975), Adaptation in natural and artificial systems.

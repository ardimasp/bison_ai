Method of data collection is through survey, interviews and viewing documentation. Analysis method is using the Fit/Gap Analysis and discounted cash flow to compute net present value. The results of this study indicate only 22.2% of the current system has fit, 55.6% of the current system has partial fit, and 22.2% of the current system has gap, and has positive value of net present value. The conclusion was that companies need to invest in virtualization technologies, by replacing obsolete systems in order to address the gaps and partial so as to improve efficiency and effectiveness. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

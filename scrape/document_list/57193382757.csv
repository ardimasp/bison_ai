During Jakarta attack, bombs and gunfire in January 14, 2016 many Indonesians defied terror with messages ""We are not afraid"" and ""Unite Indonesia""They are using the hashtag #KamiTidakTakut, which can be translated as ""We are not afraid"", or hashtag #JakartaBerani, which means ""Jakarta is brave"". The next day, Indonesia regained national resilience by having normal activity. This research attempts to examine the roles of social media toward Indonesian's national resilience after the bombing. This research gathered data from social media such as Facebook, Path, Instagram and Twitter on posting, sharing posting, tweeting and re-tweeting during the event of a terrorist attack. Methodology approaches conducted in this research were qualitative study by questionnaire. This research offers insights into a broad range of views from users of social media about the use of social in building national resilience. The strength of the report is that it provides in-depth understanding of social media users and enhances government the use of social media for building national resilience. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Terrorism; Facebook; In-buildings; In-depth understanding; Indonesia; Methodology approaches; Qualitative study; Social media; Terrorist attacks; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Antoci, A., Sabatini, F., Sodini, M., (2011) Bowling Alone but Tweeting Together: The Evolution of Human Interaction in the Social Networking Era, , (Rome, mimeo: Sapienza University of Rome); Buckley, M.E., Fawn, R., (2003) Global Responses to Terrorism: 9/11, Afghanistan, and beyond, , (London, Routledge); Dershowitz, A.M., (2002) Why Terrorism Works: Understanding the Threat, Responding to the Challenge, , (London: Yale University Press); Dufty, N., Using social media to build community disaster resilience (2012) The Australian Journal of Emergency Management, 27, pp. 40-45; Ellison, N.B., Steinfield, C., Lampe, C., The benefits of Facebook friends: Social capital and college students' use of online social network sites (2007) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 12 (4), pp. 1143-1168; Manyena, S.B., The concept of resilience revisited (2006) Disasters Journal, 30, pp. 433-450; Norris, F.H., Stevens, S.P., Pfefferbaum, B., Wyche, K.F., Pfefferbaum, R.L., Community Resilience as a Metaphor, Theory, Set of Capacities, and Strategy for Disaster Readiness (2008) American Journal of Community Psychology, 41 (1-2), pp. 127-150; Rizza, C., Pereira, G.A., Building a resilient community through social network: Ethical considerations about the 2011 Genoa floods (2014) Proceedings of the 11th International ISCRAM Conference - University Park, Pennsylvania, USA, May 2014, , ed S R Hiltz, M S Pfaff, L Plotnick and P C Shih",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Advance and Scientific Innovation, ICASI 2018","23 April 2018 through 24 April 2018",,148653,17426588,,,,"English","J.

Teamwork is always the essential part of innovation in organisation; in other words, good teamwork is an important ingredient in achieving innovation. In higher education institutions, many strategies have been implemented to achieve innovation. This paper uses the Team Quality Construct (TWQ) from Hoegl and Gemuenden (2001), which highlights several factors namely, communication, mutual support and balance between member contributions, coordination, effort and cohesion as being other essential qualities for the generation of innovation. In addition, this paper examines the relationship between teamwork and innovation by using TWQ and the Innovation Competency Development (INCODE) assessment at BINUS University International. INCODE is a form of assessment that has been implemented in BINUS' Project Hatchery classes for first-semester students from diverse academic backgrounds. The results of the study have signified the role of teamwork as a construct that influences innovation significantly. The study showed that there were no differences in respondents' perception of teamwork among students enrolled in different programmes included in the sample population. This proved that teamwork can be considered as the main contributing factor in innovation generation. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Communication; Developing ideas; INCODE; Indonesian higher education; Innovation; Innovative pedagogy; Project Hatchery; Teamwork",,,,,,"Amabile, T.M., From individual creativity to organizational innovation (1990) Innovation: Across Disciplinary Perspective, pp. 139-166. , In K.

Supporting tools design needs to be modified for the tools capability improvement and to provide new ways of working. The concept of innovative design can be applied to tools designing for up living the work way more productive in order to boost the manufacturing and service performances, meeting the mounted up customer demand. Taking the wrench product design as an example of observation and improvement initiative opportunity, this article discovers the chance of the mechanical and machinery products innovation, with the project methodology presented in applying the theories of product redesign from a manual conventional wrench to an advance design and puts forward the thought of the wrench innovative engineering design, principles and the process to electrical and mechanical mechanism. As a result, the proposed design scheme is evaluated, which indicates that the optimized design approach can be applied to a manual wrench design. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","improvement; machinery; product; redesign; tools; Wrench",,,,,,"Cooper, R.G., Kleinschmidt, E.J., New products: What separates winners from losers?

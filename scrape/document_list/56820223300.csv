This research uses descriptive qualitative methods in which semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data in Indonesia (Jakarta) and United Kingdom (Norwich). The result shows that students’ intercultural communication competence improve due to direct communication and face-to-face interaction instead of social media whereby the latter is only helpful in improving students’ knowledge and understanding the differences of their home culture and the host culture. Interactivity and other abilities of social media become influential aspect to improve students’ knowledge of host culture. Moreover, social media develops relationships between the students and their hosts country. Facebook and Instagram are found to help students improve their adaptability and flexibility to different cultures. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Culture European and Indonesian students; Intercultural communication; Social media",,,,,,"Barrett, M., Intercultural competence (2012) The 2 nd Issue of the EWC Statement Series.

In Indonesia, Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi (Corruption Eradication Commission) has been using IMC to disseminate anticorruption values to society in purpose to reduce and eliminate corruption acts in Indonesia. To improve the effectiveness of IMC on anticorruption campaign, particularly to the youth, this study aims to measure students’s attitude towards anticorruption values. It is also to describe the exposure of the agency’s IMC programs on anticorruption campaign to students, and to discuss the relationship between the two variables: anticorruption campaign exposure and students’s attitude towards anticorruption values. Quantitative approach is used by conducting a survey to Bina Nusantara University students. Descriptive and correlation analysis are used to analyze the data. It is found that students fairly accept the anticorruption values, although there is still lack of exposure to them on the IMC programs. The correlation analysis shows no significant relationship between the two variables. However, the students can accept the importance of anticorruption values which this fact can support the work of the initiator in doing their future campaign. Further research is suggested to conduct it in wider scope. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

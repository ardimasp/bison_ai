Importantly, this paper answers calls on research, exploring the routines of interaction both micro- and social psychological constructs in studying fraudulent behaviours. These aspects are relatively new, which have a little attention from auditing and fraud literature. Design/methodology/approach: Experienced fraud perpetrators were used for this study. A semi-structured interview technique was used, allowing to uncover rich descriptive data on the personal experiences of participants. It allowed them to tell and illustrate why and how they get involved in fraudulent activities. Findings: Many explanations, from a wide variety of perspectives, have been advanced to explain why people commit fraud in bureaucracy. Using reciprocity and exchange theory as a basis, it was found strong evidence for expanding fraud triangle theory (Cressey, 1953) as a predictor of individual’s intention to commit white-collar crimes. Evidence of these results provides a new challenge to other accounts of why systemic fraud would or would not occur. In this point, it highlights the concepts of social exchange and the norm of reciprocity serve as a useful beginning for explaining the factors that cause someone to commit occupational fraud. Generally, a number of distinct empirical and theoretical contributions arise from the current study. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the enrichment of fraud theory and literature, from psychological perspectives. With regard to the reciprocity between peers within and outside organisation, it offers theoretical frameworks about the reasons for the decisions to commit white-collar crimes. As such, it advances fraud and auditing studies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bureaucratic crimes; Conspiracy beliefs and acts; Fraud triggers; Preventive measures; Reciprocity",,,,,,,"Ahlin, C., Bose, P., Bribery, inefficiency, and bureaucratic delay (2007) Journal of Development Economics, 84 (1), pp. 465-486; Akkeren, J., Buckby, S., Perceptions on the causes of individual and fraudulent co-offending: views of forensic accountants (2017) Journal of Business Ethics, 146 (2), pp. 383-404; Albrecht, W.S., Albrecht, C.C., Albrecht, C.O., Fraud and corporate executives: agency, stewardship and broken trust (2004) Journal of Forensic Accounting, 5, pp. 109-130; Anand, V., Tina, D.M., Murphy, P., The continued need for diversity in fraud research (2015) Journal of Business Ethics, 131 (4), pp. 751-755; (2018) Report to the Nations global study on occupational fraud and abuse government edition; Baldi, S., Bottasso, A., Conti, M., Piccardo, C., To bid or not to bid: that is the question: public procurement, project complexity and corruption (2016) European Journal of Political Economy, 43 (6), pp. 89-106; Bali, A.O., Communication tools to fight bureaucratic corruption in Iraqi Kurdistan: a case study (2018) SAGE Open, 8 (4), pp. 1-11; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory in cultural context (2002) Applied Psychology, 51 (2), pp. 269-290; Benson, M.L., Madensen, T.D., Eck, J.E., White-collar crime from an opportunity perspective (2009) The Criminology of White-Collar Crime, pp. 175-193. , Simpson, S.S. and Weisburd, D., and,(Eds), Springer, New York, NY; Blackburn, K., Forgues-Puccio, G.F., Financial liberalization, bureaucratic corruption and economic development (2010) Journal of International Money and Finance, 9 (7), pp. 1321-1339; Blau, P.M., (1964) Exchange and Power in Social Life, , John Wiley, New York; Blau, P.M., (1966) Exchange and Power in Social Life, , John Wiley, New York; Boje, D.M., (2008) Storytelling Organizations, , SAGE, London; Boje, D.M., (2011) Storytelling and the Future of Organizations: An Antenarrative Handbook, , Routledge, London; BolognaLindquist, R., (1995) Fraud Auditing and Forensic Accounting: new Tools and Techniques, , Chichester Wiley, New York, NY; Brandt, U.S., Svendsen, G.T., Why does bureaucratic corruption occur in the EU?

It is hoped, it stimulates our critical understanding of psychological aetiology on individual’s intention to perpetrate partial fraud or to co-offend. Design/methodology/approach: This study was developed as a reflection of empirical work conducted in Indonesia public sectors. Findings: By suggesting the important process of individual’s cognitive reasoning, this study identifies that there is an overlooked process made by prior studies in terms of personality traits as a strong predictive power for individual’s intention to commit fraudulent behaviours or white-collar crimes. This study argues that they should not be independently predictive of fraud behaviours. This study acknowledges that in the prediction of social behaviours, whether fraudulent behaviours or not, there are no absolute answers to or analyses of it. However, it is instructive to consider social cognitive theory in elucidating the psychological pathways associated with fraudulent behaviours. This is because it can bridge an appropriate lens in positioning personalised behaviours as a predictor of perpetrating fraudulent behaviours. Then, this study does not have any serious concerns about how many antecedents influence behaviours of intention to perform wrongdoings. However, the functioning of individual cognitive reasoning should not be ignored. Both theoretical and managerial implications from this study are discussed to suggest alternative theories on causes of fraudulent behaviours. Practical implications: This study uses social cognitive theory as a basis of analysis. Through a simple analysis, a different perspective of treating the antecedents of fraud has been proposed, so that it can be used to develop more effective intervention that can deter fraudulent behaviours within an organisation. Originality/value: This study theoretically explores psychological mechanisms or pathways related to the functioning of individual’s reasoning. Then, this study proposes the critiques, in which it is intended to stimulate another research on deepening and broadening a theory of fraud. In short, this study importantly also offers recommendations and opportunities for future research and organisations to develop effective prevention that can deter fraudulent behaviours. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Fraudulent behaviours; Personality traits; Psychological aetiology; Social cognitive theory",,,,,"University of Edinburgh","The authors are grateful to Prof Jake Ansell and Prof Tom Archibald of Business School, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK, for their comments and discussions on previous versions of this work.","Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Akkeren, J., Buckby, S., Perceptions on the causes of individual and fraudulent co-offending: views of forensic accountants (2017) Journal of Business Ethics, 146 (2), pp. 383-404; Albrecht, W.S., Albrecht, C.C., Albrecht, C.O., Fraud and corporate executives: agency, stewardship and broken trust (2004) Journal of Forensic Accounting, 5 (1), pp. 109-130; Anand, V., Tina, D.M., Murphy, P., The continued need for diversity in fraud research (2015) Journal of Business Ethics, 131 (4), pp. 751-755; Aquino, K., Freeman, D., Reed, A., II, Lim, V.K.G., Felps, W., Testing a social cognitive model of moral behavior: the interaction of situational factors and moral identity centrality (2009) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 97 (1), pp. 123-141; Ashforth, B.E., Anand, V., The normalization of corruption in organizations (2003) Research in Organizational Behavior, 25, pp. 1-52; Bandura, A., Kurtines, W.M., Gewirtz, J.L., Social cognitive theory of moral thought and action (1991) Handbook of Theories of Social Psychology, 1. , and (Eds), Erlbaum, Hillsdale, NJ; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory in cultural context (2002) Applied Psychology, 51 (2), pp. 269-290; Bandura, A., Van Lange, P.A.M., Kruglanski, A.W., Tory Higgins, E., Social cognitive theory (2012) Handbook of Moral Behavior and Development, 1. , and (Eds), SAGE Publications, London; Belle, N., Cantarelli, P., What causes unethical behavior?

This is because many fraud studies have mainly been focussed on the solo psychological aspects of the offender, rather than the social environments. This study also makes clear that fraudulent behaviours are different from delinquencies. Design/methodology/approach: This research is focussed on the big bureaucratic scandals, occurring in Indonesia. The authors chose Indonesia because it places one of the corrupt countries in The Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries. To achieve the goals, the authors used the ethnographic approach by conducting an exclusive interview with 30 elite executives from the Government of Indonesia. Findings: This study finds a deeper understanding of the root causes of fraud committed by individuals and co-offenders, in which micro-psychological, situational, sociological and criminological aspects are linked together.

Design/methodology/approach: This study is a part of fieldwork carried out in Indonesia. Findings: Organisational fraud is an exceptional type of crime. Hence, the underlying antecedents and consequences of fraud in organisation are distinct from other crimes, especially violent crimes. The underlying logic in criminological and sociological theories and literature cannot fully explain the causal factors of fraud in the organisation. This leads to a theoretical discussion about the reconstruction of the fraud theory. Implications and suggestions for further studies are discussed in this study. Originality/value: This study provides a new understanding of fraud and its antecedents and consequences. In doing so, it examines the long-standing debate in criminology and sociology about the theories concerning crime causation, as these areas provide the underlying logic of fraud theory. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Crime causation; Fraud; Fraud causation; The concept of fraud",,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Albrecht, W.S., Albrecht, C., Albrecht, C.C., Current trends in fraud and its detection (2008) Information Security Journal: A Global Perspective, 17 (1), pp. 2-12; Albrecht, C.C., (2014) Iconic Fraud Triangle endures Metaphor diagram helps everybody understand fraud, , www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=4294983342; Alempaki, D., Doğan, G., Saccardo, S., Deception and reciprocity (2019) Experimental Economics, 22 (4), pp. 980-1001; Ashforth, B.E., Anand, V., The normalization of corruption in organizations (2003) Research in Organizational Behavior, 25, pp. 1-52; (2018) Report to the nations; global study on occupational fraud and abuse, , https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/acfepublic/2018-report-to-the-nations.pdf; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of moral thought and action (1991) Handbook of Theories of Social Psychology, 1. , Kurtines, W.M. and Gewirtz, J.L.,(Eds), Erlbaum, Hillsdale, NJ; Boyle, D.M., DeZoort, F.T., Hermanson, D.R., The effect of alternative fraud model use on auditors’ fraud risk judgments (2015) Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, 34 (6), pp. 578-596; Brown, M.E., Mitchell, M.S., Ethical and unethical leadership: exploring new avenues for future research (2010) Business Ethics Quarterly, 20 (4), pp. 583-616; Brunton, M., Eweje, G., The influence of culture on ethical perception held by business students in a New Zealand university (2010) Business Ethics: A European Review, 19 (4), pp. 349-362; Choo, F., Tan, K., An American dream theory of corporate executive fraud (2007) Accounting Forum, 31 (2), pp. 203-215; Collins, R.E., The effect of gender on violent and nonviolent recidivism: a meta-analysis (2010) Journal of Criminal Justice, 38 (4), pp. 675-684; Cornell, D.G., Warren, J., Hawk, G., Stafford, E., Oram, G., Pine, D., Psychopathy in instrumental and reactive violent offenders (1996) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 64 (4), pp. 783-790; Craig, J.M., Piquero, N.L., The effects of low self-control and desire-for-control on white-collar offending: a replication (2016) Deviant Behavior, 37 (11), pp. 308-1324; Cressey, D.R., The criminal violation of financial trust (1950) American Sociological Review, 15 (6), pp. 738-743; Cressey, D.R., (1953) A Study in the Social Psychology of Embezzlement: other People's Money, , The Free Press, Glencoe, IL; Declercq, F., Audenaert, K., A case of mass murder: personality disorder psychopathology and violence mode (2011) Aggression and Violent Behavior, 16 (2), pp. 135-143; Donelson, D.C., Ege, M.S., Mcinnis, J.M., Internal control weaknesses and financial reporting fraud (2017) Auditing: A Journal of Practice and Theory, 36 (3), pp. 45-25; Dorminey, J., Fleming, A.S., Kranacher, M.J., Riley, R.A., Beyond the fraud triangle (2010) The CPA Journal, pp. 16-23; Dorminey, J., Fleming, A.S., Kranacher, M.J., Riley, R.A., The evolution of fraud theory (2012) Issues in Accounting Education, 27 (2), pp. 555-579; Duffield, G., Grabosky, P., The psychology of fraud (2001) Trends and Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice, 199, pp. 1-6; Duh, M., Belak, J., Milfelner, B., Core values culture and ethical climate as constitutional elements of ethical behaviour: exploring differences between family and non-family enterprises (2010) Journal of Business Ethics, 97 (3), pp. 473-489; Free, C., Looking through the fraud triangle: a review and call for new directions (2015) Meditari Accountancy Research, 23 (2), pp. 175-196; Glenn, A.L., Raine, A., Psychopathy and instrumental aggression: evolutionary neurobiological, and legal perspectives (2009) International Journal of Law and Psychiatry, 32 (4), pp. 253-258; Gottfredson, M.R., Hirschi, T., (1990) A General Theory of Crime, , Stanford University Press; Holtfreter, K., Is occupational fraud btypicalQ white-collar crime?

Design/methodology/approach: This study was conducted in one of regencies in Indonesia. The authors interviewed nine top managers across local agencies and four senior local government internal auditors. The people involved have formal and informal networks with a regent who has been arrested by Indonesia’s Corruption Eradication Commission, because of white-collar crime syndicates, when running governmental systems. Findings: While many approaches to fraud mitigation have been proposed, organisations in practice particularly in the public sector find it hard to implement successful methods to understand, detect and prevent fraud. In practice, this occurs due to simplified assumption on or multiplicity of overlapping fraud concepts. There is also a lack of appreciation of impact of organisational dynamics which facilitates fraud. Behavioural and political issues within an organisation need to be addressed when proposing fraud prevention. The study emphasises that it is too naïve to offer internal control as one-size-fits-all fraud prevention. For practitioners, corrupt behaviour tends to be the most challenging part, compared to other fraud schemes such as asset misappropriation and financial statement fraud. In this paper, the authors urge organisation to adapt a more systematic approach, involving across governmental anti-corruption agencies and civil society actors. This may be facilitated through communication among those parties, including a sound whistleblowing system.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors interviewed 15 executive managers in one of Indonesia local governments, by using semi-structured questions. Findings: The authors explored the dynamics of both self- and other-directed factors in the spread of fraudulent behaviours, by focusing on the public-sector fraud landscape in local government. As a basis of analysis, the authors applied the theory of planned behaviours. In this study, “a concept of fraud triangle” substantially provides little help in elucidating the causation of fraudulent behaviours in local government. The theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. Originality/value: This study offers new direction on broadening and deepening fraud literature and theories about the root causes of fraudulent behaviours. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Fraud; Psychology; Self and other-directed fraud factors; Theory of planned behaviour",,,,,"Institute of Management Accountants, IMA

In recent years, the theme of risk management and internal controls, which is popular in the industry and private sector, has been mirrored by public sector organisations. Of course, it is to improve fraud risk control systems. We have to accept that public sector organisations have a growing need to control the (fraud) risks in a rapidly changing economic environment. Within this situation an effective internal control is becoming strategically important in many organisations, as it is proving to be a cost-efficient way to manage these risks in everyday operations. Here, the authors conducted a case study on the risk management control system at an Indonesian local government. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses mixed methods, integrating quantitative and qualitative data – in-depth interviews and questionnaires were required to address the social phenomenon being investigated. Findings: This study found that the structure of the control system fits a generic model, in which control systems are fundamental factors to all departments. It shows that control systems can support managers to align employee capabilities, activities and performance with the organisation’s goals and missions. In addition, the authors could identify, risk assessment and monitoring activities are effective measures of controlling organisation’s activities, and potentially could diagnose potential (fraud) risks, deterring to the achievement of organisational aims. Ideally, those aspects should be performed on a continuous basis if organisations want to prevent the spread of numerous potential menaces. In other words, if an organisation fails to carry out risk assessment correctly, it will result in unidentified possibility of fraud risks. The more explicit the risk assessment, the more effective the detection of fraud. Practical implications: It can be alternative to consider Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s internal control as fraud mitigation in local government. Originality/value: This study offers new directive discussion about internal controls as notion of fraud mitigation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Contingency theory; Fraud risk; Internal controls; Local government",,,,,,,"Al-Saggaf, Y., Burmeister, O., Weckert, J., Reasons behind unethical behaviour in the Australian ICT workplace (2015) Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society, 13 (3-4), pp. 235-255; Altamuro, J., Beatty, A., How does internal control regulation affect financial reporting?

The paper offers insights to enhance our understanding of the nexus of corruption, local business and money laundering scandals. These insights are synthesised from contemporary thinking and current research findings by adopting conspiracy theory. The evidence shows that fraud schemes involving corruption syndicates have become intractable, either because of influence peddling or high-profile people implicated in corruption scandals, making it difficult for anti-corruption provisions to be implemented. Therefore, it is clearly necessary to provide a cautionary note and to consider the analysis of structural forces that reveal the logic of criminal forms and conduct. The paper also points out that the establishment of money laundering laws and the creation of anti-money laundering agencies (strict law enforcement) can effectively deter predatory activities of financial intermediaries in facilitating money laundering practices. In an aggregative analysis of the underlying economic model of crime, the findings of the study provide significant support for a number of the postulates of the conspiracy theory of crime. These include the deterrence effect in respect of perpetrators such as unscrupulous local business staff, corrupters and launderers. © 2018, University of Tyumen.

Within local government, contingency theory has emerged as a lens for exploring the links between public sector initiatives to improve risk mitigation and the structure of the control system.

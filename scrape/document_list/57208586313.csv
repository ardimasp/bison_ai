Physical security could be improved through the implementation of indoor positioning with a real-time monitoring system. Other than security needs, the information provided could be used for emergency evacuation purposes in a disastrous situation. Presently, indoor positioning is principally based on wireless signals, such as WiFi, RFID, Zigbee, Bluetooth, etc. This study designs a user access management system in the Data Center using indoor-positioning. For the indoor positioning method, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbor (FkNN) algorithms and Kalman Filter implementation are evaluated. The simulation result shows that the proposed method can improve the positioning accuracy until 8% compared to the existing method. © 2019 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.","Bluetooth Low Energy; Fuzzy kNN; Indoor Positioning; Kalman Filter; RSSI",,,,,,,"Salas, A.C., (2014) Indoor Positioning System Based on Bluetooth Low Energy, , Degree's Thesis Submitted to the Faculty of the Escola Tècnica d'Enginyeria de Telecomunicació de Barcelona Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Barcelona; Kriz, P., Maly, F., Kozel, T., Improving Indoor Localization Using Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons (2016) Mobile Information Systems, pp. 1-11. , http://dx.doi.org/DOI:10.1155/2016/2083094; Sukhov, R.R., Amzakarov, M.B., Isaev, E.A., Advanced Data Center Economy (2013) Business Informatic, 2 (24), pp. 13-18; Dumsky, D.V., Isaev, E.A., Data centers for physical research (2015) Physics Procedia, 71, pp. 298-302. , http://dx.doi.org/DOI:10.1016/j.phpro.2015.08.330, Elsevier B.V; Lin, X.Y., Ho, T.W., Fang, C.C., Yen, Z.S., Yang, B.J., Lai, F., A mobile indoor positioning system based on iBeacon technology (2015) Proceedings of the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, 2015, pp. 4970-4973. , https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319507, EMBS, Milan; Van, H.T., Poorter, E.D., Crombez, P., Lemic, F., Handziski, V., Wirström, N., Wolisz, A., Moerman, I., Performance analysis of multiple Indoor Positioning Systems in a healthcare environment (2016) International Journal of Health Geographics, 15 (7), pp. 1-15. , https://doi.org/10.1186/s12942doi.org/10.1186/s12942-016-0034-z; Soewito, B., Wiguna, A., Suharjito, S., Diana, D., Bluetooth Low Energy: Comparing 4 Trilateration Models in Indoor Positioning System (2018) International Journal on Communications Antenna and Propagation (IRECAP), 8 (6), pp. 500-509. , https://doi.org/10.15866/irecap.v8i6.13476; Yang, Z., Liu, Y., Quality of Trilateration: Confidence-Based Iterative Localization (2010) IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 21 (5), pp. 631-640. , May; Zhuang, Y., Yang, J., Li, Y., Qi, L., El-Sheimy, N., Smartphone-based indoor localization with bluetooth low energy beacons (2016) Sensors (Switzerland), 16 (5), pp. 1-20. , https://doi.org/10.3390/s16050596; Hansen, R., Thomsen, B., Thomsen, L.L., Adamsen, F.S., SmartCampusAAU-an open platform enabling indoor positioning and navigation (2013) Proceedings of 14Th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management, 2, pp. 33-38; Karlsson, F., Karlsson, M., Bernhardsson, B., Tufvesson, F., Persson, M., Sensor fused indoor positioning using dual-band WiFi signal measurements (2015) Proceedings of European Control Conference (ECC), Linz, pp. 1669-1672; Zafari, F., Papapanagiotou, I., Enhancing iBeacon Based Micro-Location with Particle Filtering (2015) Proceedings of IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 1, pp. 1-7. , San Diego, CA; Deepesh, P.C., Akshay Tiwary, R.R., Vikram, N., Rao, and N.

It includes user access and traffic management. Monitoring people positions, in the Data Center, will be more efficient with the indoor positioning system. Beside to security needs, indoor positioning system should be used for emergency evacuation needs in the Data Center. Indoor positioning has its challenges where global positioning system (GPS) becomes ineffective when used indoors because of no line of sight (LOS) with satellite. Currently, the indoor positioning is mainly based on the wireless signal, such as WiFi, RFID, Zigbee, Bluetooth, etc. In this paper, indoor positioning is developed based on Bluetooth 4.0 beacon technology and its RSSI value. As the classifier, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbors (FkNN) algorithm are evaluated. Impact of Kalman Filter application to improve the accuracy also being tested. The simulation results shows that the performance of FkNN is better than kNN. While, Kalman Filter can improve the performance of kNN significantly. © 2018 IEEE.","Bluetooth Low Energy; FkNN; Indoor Positioning; Kalman Filter; KNN","Advanced traffic management systems; Bluetooth; Indoor positioning systems; Kalman filters; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Wi-Fi; Bluetooth low energies (BTLE); Emergency evacuation; Filter applications; FkNN; Fuzzy k nearest neighbor (FKNN); Indoor positioning; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Traffic management; Global positioning system",,,,"Binus University","This research is partially funded by Bina Nusantara University through Hibah Terapan Universitas Bina Nusantara 2018.","Corbacho Salas, A., Indoor positioning system based on bluetooth low energy (2014) Universitat Polit{e}cnica de Catalunya; Kriz, P., Maly, F., Kozel, T., Improving indoor localization using bluetooth low energy beacons (2016) Mob.

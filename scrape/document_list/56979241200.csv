Companies can use information obtained from social media to analyze how the communities respond to their services or products. The biggest challenge in processing information in social media like Twitter, is the unstructured sentences which could lead to incorrect text processing. However, this information is very important for companies’ survival. In this research, we proposed a method to extract keywords from tweets in Indonesian language, WPKE. We compared it with RAKE, an algorithm that is language independent and usually used for keyword extraction. Finally, we develop a method to do clustering to groups the topics of complaints with data set obtained from Twitter using the “komplain” hashtag. Our method can obtain the accuracy of 72.92% while RAKE can only obtain 35.42%. Copyright © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Round-robin system which is commonly used in tournament cannot be efficiently used regarding to the number of participant. The higher the number of participant, the longer and the more exhausted the players. This paper suggests Swiss pairing system to do scheduling in Xiang Qi tournament. The capacity of the tournament can be increased, but the player can still compete with the optimal result. The pairing function considers the player's record, the 'bye' notes, the player's color preferences, and the origin of the player's club. The time complexity of Swiss pairing and Round-robin is shown in the evaluation where the Swiss-pairing is more efficient than Round-robin system. © 2016 IEEE.","chess tournaments; Swiss pairing; Xiang Qi","Information management; Scheduling; chess tournaments; Color preferences; Pairing function; Scheduling problem; Swiss pairing; Time complexity; Tournament algorithm; Xiang Qi; Routers",,,,,"Hanafiah, N., Hartanto, J., Arifin, Y., Frans, H., Cristian, W., A web-based Chinese chess xiang qi using n-tier architecture model (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 14-18; Rasmussen, Rasmus, V., Trick, M.A., Round robin scheduling-a survey (2008) European Journal of Operational Research, 188 (3), pp. 617-636; Kujansuu, E., Lindberg, T., Mäkinen, E., The stable roommates problem and chess tournament pairings (1999) Divulgaciones Matemáticas, 7 (1), pp. 19-28; Glickman, M.E., Jensen, S.T., Adaptive paired comparison design (2005) Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference, 127 (1), pp. 279-293; Elmenreich, W., Ibounig, T., Fehérvári, I., Robustness versus performance in sorting and tournament algorithms (2009) Acta Polytechnica Hungarica, 6 (5), pp. 7-18; Csató, L., Ranking by pairwise comparisons for Swiss-system tournaments (2013) Central European Journal of Operations Research, 21 (4), pp. 783-803; (2004), Chinese Chess Rules at clubxiangqi.com; (2016), http//php.net/manual/phpfi2.phpatphp.net, The PHP group; (2016), https//framework.zend.com/aboutatframework.zend.com; (2016), https//docs.oracle.com/Javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/atoracle.com",,,"BINUS Univerity;IEEE Indonesia Section;Wiley","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2016","16 November 2016 through 18 November 2016",,127842,,9781509033522,,,"English","Proc.

However, the limitation of the length that can be written is about 160 characters and the text is in unstructured sentence. It becomes the biggest obstacle to process the information. Those unstructured sentences cause a difficulty for preprocessing in text processing tools. Therefore, normalization is needed to make the unstructured sentences can be more understandable by a machine. We proposed a normalization of Indonesian language method which adopting some ideas of normalization from other researchers and adjust to the problem of Indonesian characteristic in unstructured sentence. The experiment exploits Twitter data which use Indonesian language in complaint category. The process is divided into three stages, which are cleaning process, OOV detection and word replacement. List of Basic words and Slang dictionary are used in the OOV detection. On the other hand, Context dictionary is built to solve the ambiguity problem. The algorithm can reaches the accuracy about 90% in a complaint category. © 2017 The Authors.

The current technology development makes the classic games have to adapt by converting the style of play, such as online version of the classic game. N-tier architecture provides a model for software developers to create an application which has a high flexibility and reusability. By dividing the application into some tiers, developers have options to modify or add a particular layer, instead of changing the whole application. The implementation of n-tier can be done by supporting with internet. The combination of Xiang Qi with online game technology based on web is expected to be successful in attracting the attention of gamers/players. The paper presents a re-packaging of conventional games into an online game application which built using n-tier developing approach that can manage accessibility and interactivity of the games. © 2015 The Authors.

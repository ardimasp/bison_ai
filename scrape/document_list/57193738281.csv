This research was conducted on customers in Jakarta. Data were collected from a sample of 100 respondents. The data were analyzed using path analysis. The result of this study found that e-marketing did not affect the e-satisfaction. E-marketing and e-service quality had an influence on e-satisfaction. E-satisfaction had an influence on e-loyalty. E-marketing and e-service did not influence e-loyalty. Based on the results of this study, we suggested that hotels should develop their website with interesting and detailed features for e-marketing and also provide live chat service for increasing e-service quality. E-satisfaction can be supported by customer satisfaction surveys on a regular basis or to be a part of the standard operating procedure, whereas customer loyalty programs need to be developed in the near future to build customers' e-loyalty. © 2016 IEEE.","e-loyalty; E-marketing; e-satisfaction; e-service quality","Commerce; Marketing; Publishing; Quality of service; Regression analysis; Sales; Customer loyalty programs; Customer satisfaction survey; E-loyalty; E-marketing; E-satisfaction; E-service quality; Hospitality industry; Standard operating procedures; Customer satisfaction",,,,,"Central Bureau of Statistics Number of Star and Non-star Hotels in Indonesia during 2010-2014, , http://www.bps.go.id/index.php/publikasi/1121, Online Available; Amstrong, G., Kotler, P., (2015) Marketing: An Introduction, , 12th ed.

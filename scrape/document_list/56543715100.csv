The aim of this research is to identify predictor variables of perceived risk of anti-corruption e-learning. When risk perception is low, attitude toward e-learning is expected to be more positive. This psychotechnological research employs predictive correlational design, with the predictors (1) email phishing literacy and (2) anomia. The participants of this research were 71 students of faculty of psychology at a private university in Jakarta, Indonesia (20 males, 51 females; Mean of age = 19.93 years old; Standard Devi- ation of age = 1.397 years old). The data were analyzed by using simple linear regression analyses. Results of this research show that both variables are able to predict perceived risk of anti-corruption e-learning, consecutively in negative and positive ways. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Anomia; Anti-corruption; Phishing literacy; Psychology of e-learning","Computer crime; E-learning; Electronic mail; Internet; Regression analysis; Risk perception; Ubiquitous computing; Wireless sensor networks; Anomia; Anti-corruption; Indonesia; Internet connection; Perceived risk; Phishing; Predictor variables; Simple linear regression analysis; Crime",,,,,"Andersen, T.B., Bentzen, J., Dalgaard, C.-J., Selaya, P., Does the internet reduce corruption?

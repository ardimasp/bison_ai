Many researchers have analysed the direct and indirect relationships with antecedent variables of organisational innovativeness. The influence of transformational leadership styles has been widely approved to have an effect to organisational innovativeness. However, organisations sometimes fail to achieve their organisational innovativeness due to their limited understanding of the relationships between leadership, and knowledge-based empowering interaction that will enhance organisational innovativeness. This study is constructed to fill a research gap between Digital Transformational Leadership Styles and Organisational Innovativeness with Knowledge-Based Empowering Interaction as mediator. It deploys 32 digital firms' owners and executives in Indonesia as samples. Data was gathered through online questionnaire of Likert's Scales, and analysed with Smart Partial Least Squares. The result shows that organisations should consider the Knowledge-Based Empowering Interaction to increase Organisational Innovativeness. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Digital transformational leadership; Knowledge-based empowering interaction; Organisational innovativeness",,,,,,"Aksan, N., Kisac, B., Aydin, M., Demirbuken, S., Symbolic interaction theory (2009) Procedia-Social and Behavioural Sciences, 1, pp. 902-904; Analoui, B.D., Doloriert, C.H., Sambrook, S., Leadership and knowledge management in UK ICT organisations (2013) Journal of Management Development, 32 (1), pp. 4-17; Arif, S., Akram, A., Transformational Leadership and Organisational Performance (2018) SEISENSE Journal of Management, 1 (3), pp. 59-75; Arshad, A.S., Rasli, A., Arshad, A.A., Mohd Zain, Z., (2016) Transformational Leadership and Business Performance: An Insight From Technology-based SMEs in Malaysia; Avolio, B.J., Bass, B.M., Re-examining the components of transformational and transactional leadership using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (1999) Journal of Occupational and Organisational Psychology, 72, pp. 441-462; Barney, J., The resource-based view of the firm: Ten years after 1991 (2001) Journal of Management, 27 (6), pp. 625-641; Barney, J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Bass, B.M., Two Decades of Research and Development in Transformational Leadership (1999) European Journal Of Work And Organisational Psychology, 8 (1), pp. 9-32; Bass, B.M., Riggio, R.E., (2006) Transformational Leadership, , 2nd ed.

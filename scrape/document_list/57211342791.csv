The proposed mechanism is motivated by natural-phenomenon of real chameleons in protecting and safeguarding their life from predators or extreme temperature. The chameleons' natural-capability for defending their life is scientifically adopted as a standard for thing (e.g. company) to preserve its business running good. Thru five simple stages (i.e. preliminary analysis, literature review, data/information analysis, measurement model construction, and measurement test), the study was conducted. In final part, the offered mechanism was realized in measuring the resilience potency of two companies (dummy companies) by comparing their resilience value with resilience base-line (standard). © 2019 IEEE.","Chameleon; Measuring mechanism; Natural-phenomenon; Resilience","Chameleon; Extreme temperatures; Literature reviews; Measurement model; Measurement-based; Natural phenomena; Preliminary analysis; Resilience; Data communication systems",,,,,"Jain, M., Singh, V., Rani, A., A novel nature-inspired algorithm for optimization: Squirrel search algorithm (2019) Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 44, pp. 148-175; Holland, J.H., (1975) Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems, , University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, MI; Eberhart, R., Kennedy, J., A new optimizer using particle swarm theory (1995) Proceeding of the Sixth International Symposium on Micro Machine and Human Science, pp. 39-43; Dorigo, M., Birattari, M., Stutzle, T., Ant colony optimization (2006) IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, 1 (4), pp. 28-39; Basturk, B., Karaboga, D., An artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm for numeric function optimization (2006) IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium, 8, pp. 687-697; Utama, D.N., Mitchell, A., Fieri, B., Richard, H., A simple butterfly lifecycle algorithm for measuring company's growth performance (2019) Annual Conference on Industrial and System Engineering (ACISE); Rashedi, E., Nezamabadi-Pour, H., Saryazdi, S., GSA: A gravitational search algorithm (2009) Information Science, 179 (13), pp. 2232-2248; Mirjalili, S., Mirjalili, S.M., Hatamlou, A., Multi-verse optimizer: A nature-inspired algorithm for global optimization (2016) Neural Computing and Applications, 27 (2), pp. 495-513; Kaveh, A., Talatahari, S., A novel heuristic optimization method: Charged system search (2010) Acta Mechanica, 213 (3), pp. 267-289; Utama, D.N., Nurlatifani, S., Fuzzy eco-DSM for road traffic engineering (2018) LOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 195 (1), pp. 1-7; Zhi, H., Liu, S., Face recognition based on genetic algorithm (2019) Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation, 58, pp. 495-502; Meng, Q.N., Xu, X., Price forecasting using an ACO-based support vector regression ensemble in cloud manufacturing (2018) Computers and Industrial Engineering, 125, pp. 171-177; Zabihi, F., Nasiri, B., A novel history-driven artificial bee colony algorithm for data clustering (2018) Applied Soft Computing, 71, pp. 226-241; Nagpal, S., Arora, S., Dey, S., Shreya, Feature selection using gravitational search algorithm for biomedical data (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 115, pp. 258-265; Elaziz, M.A., Oliva, D., Ewees, A.A., Xiong, S., Multi-level thresholding-based grey scale image segmentation using multiobjective multi-verse optimizer (2019) Expert Systems with Applications, 125, pp. 112-129; Precup, R.E., Petriu, E.M., Radae, M.B., Voisan, E.J., Dragan, F., Adaptive charged system search approach to path planning for multiple mobile robots (2015) IFAC, 48 (10), pp. 294-299; Gray, J.E., Revision ofthe genera and species ofchamaeleonidae, with the description of some new species (1865) Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, pp. 465-479; Pollak, E., (2003) Chamaeleo (Trioceros) Melleri Profile, , AdCham.com, [Retrieved 2019-04-08]; Kalisch, K., (2002) Chameleons!

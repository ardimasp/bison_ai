Internet of things can be used for environmental monitoring to make an early warning system for disaster. This technology is much needed to warn people about flood that usually happen in Jakarta. In this prototype water level sensor are used to measure whether the water level has reached a dangerous state and flow rate sensor is used to measure flow rate. In this paper the number of notification sent and the time it needed since water level has reached a dangerous state until a notification alert is received is measure to see if the notification can be receive before flood happens. The result shows that most of the notification received before flood happens. The states of the sensor and internet speed affect the process to send the notification. © 2018 Author(s).",,,,,,,"Miorandi, D., Sicari, S., De Pellegrini, F., Chlamtac, I., Internet of things: Vision, applications and research challenges (2012) Science Direct; (2011) Geospasial Badan Penanggulangan Bencana, , [Online]; Wister, M.A., Pancardo, P., Jara, A.J., Acosta, F.D., Hernandez-Nolasco, J.A., Water Level Meter for Alerting Population about Floods (2016) IEEE; Wister, M.A., Pancardo, P., Jara, A.J., Acosta, F.D., Hernandez-Nolasco, J.A., Emergency population warning about Floods by Social Media (2016) IEEE; www.emartee.com, [Online]; http://www.microelectronicos.com/datasheets/UCTS0058.pdf, [Online]; Development, S., Seeed Wiki, , http://wiki.seeed.cc/LinkIt_ONE/, [Online]; www.ubidotscom, [Online]; Seal, V., Raha, A., Maity, S., Mitra, S.K., Mukherjee, A., Naskar, M.K., ASIMPLE FLOOD FORECASTING SCHEME USING WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS (2012) IJASUC; Helmenstine, P.A.M., ThoughtCo, , https://www.thoughtco.com/how-to-calculate-percent-error-609584, [Online]; Bari, N., Mani, G., Berkovich, S., Internet of Things as a Methodological Concept (2013) IEEE; Hussin, S.A.S., Ismail, M., Sofian, H., INTELLIGENT FLOOD INFORMATION SYSTEM VIA SMS (IFIS) (2012) Research Gate; Alkandari, A., Alnasheet, M., Alabduljader, Y., Moein, S.M., Water Monitoring System using Wireless Sensor Network (WSN): Case Study of Kuwait Beaches (2012) IEEE",,"Gaol F.L.Gajjar P.N.Akhtar J.",,"American Institute of Physics Inc.","6th International Conference on Science and Engineering in Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics 2018,  ScieTech 2018","20 January 2018 through 21 January 2018",,142212,0094243X,9780735417694,,,"English","AIP Conf.

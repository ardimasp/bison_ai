The most commonly pavement failures found are potholes and stripping, which are related to water intrusion to the hot mix asphalt (HMA). This research aims to provide an analysis on the moisture susceptibility of HMA with the addition of waterproofing additives, namely the Wetfix-BE, Wetbond-SP, and hydrated lime. The Marshall, Cantabro Loss, and Indirect Tensile Ratio tests were undertaken to assess the performance of the prepared samples. It was found that the specimens that were prepared using hydrated lime, as an alternative and low-cost waterproofing additive, perform reasonably well compared to the specimens that were prepared using the other additives. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,"12/AKM/PNT/2019","This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Analisa Kelembaban Pada Campuran Aspal” with contract number: 12/AKM/PNT/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","Kandhal, P.S., Rickards, I.J., (2001) Premature Failure of Asphalt Overlays from Stripping: Case Histories; Rmeili, E., Scullion, T., Detecting Stripping in Asphalt Concrete Layers Using Ground Penetrating Radar (1997) Transp.

Road pavement is an expensive infrastructure, and hence, it is important to ensure that the pavement layers can last until its designed lifetime. Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) pavement is one of the most commonly used type of pavement. However, the HMA pavements are often found with water-related distresses at an early stage, and hence, the pavement will not be able to last, while Indonesia is a tropical country and has a relatively high groundwater level in some major cities. Therefore, it is necessary to study an additive that could help in improving the moisture susceptibility of HMA layers. This study aims to provide an evaluation of moisture susceptibility of HMA pavements with the addition of waterproofing additives, including Wetfix-BE, and Wetbond-SP. Three tests were conducted to assess the moisture susceptibility, which are Marshall, Cantabro Loss, and Indirect Tensile Strength tests. It was found that both additives worked well in helping the HMA samples to be more resistant to water, although the samples with the additional of Wetbond-SP had a better performance than the samples with Wetfix-BE added. © 2019 Author(s).",,,,,,"Binus University: 12/AKM/PNT/2019

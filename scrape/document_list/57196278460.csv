But the problem lies on the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in companies which are all done manually. This study aims to digitize SOP in order for employees to gain a wellbeing at work. Also, the research method will be held with neuro-research against XYZ company. The content validity of digitizing SOP will be held by experts and the data collection will be using semantic differential techniques in a scale of 1-7. The result of this research is: (1)The XYZ company's employees sometimes are in the state of wellbeing in an significant value of pada á<0,05; (2)the employees of XYZ company sometimes feels satisfied significantly in their works with value of á<0,05; (3)the employees of XYZ company sometimes in the state of feeling unsatisfied significantly with value of á<0,05; (4)the cognitive dimension of wellbeing are defined with some variables such are the feeling of sufficient, achievement, peace, safisfied with discrepancy of needs and wants, and lastly self-fullfilment as the most dominant factor in shaping the wellbeing of employee of XYZ Company with the outcome of significant á<0,05. However, if these dimensions are elaborated deeply from each variable, then the wellbeing state of the employees from XYZ company will rise 15.329 times from the current state. The implication is to build a new system to digitizing the business process and SOP which will bring positive experience in using technology that will bring the employees wellbeing. © Serials Publications.","Digitizing; Neuroresearch; Standard operating procedure (SOP); Wellbeing",,,,,,"Attar, G.A., Sweis, R.J., The relationship between information technology adoption and job satisfaction in contracting companies in Jordan (2010) Electronic Journal of Information Technology in Construction, 15, pp. 44-63; Barth, E., Bryson, A., Olsen, H., How does innovation affect worker well-being?

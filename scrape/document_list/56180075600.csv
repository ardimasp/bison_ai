One of these structural systems is the outrigger system. Outrigger is one of the structural stiffening systems that can be used on building structures, especially in high-rise buildings. Structural systems such as outriggers are used for earthquake-resistant buildings, so the performance of building structures can be increased by producing minimum displacement. This research will design the building as high as 40 and 50 floors, with the calculation of earthquake based on Indonesia Earthquake Design Code SNI 1726-2012. This study will be compared the calculation of seismic loads in the building structure with and without using outrigger, so that it can be seen the difference in the seismic loads and the performance of the structure. From this research, it is found that the outrigger system can reduce the seismic loads in the structure, and also is able to reduce the lateral displacement of the structure. The inter-story lateral displacement of 50 storey and 40 storey structure can be reduce up to 2.06% and 7.84% with one outrigger and 3.76% and 12, 49% with two outrigger. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","earthquake; high-rise building; lateral displacement; load distribution; outrigger","Earthquake engineering; Earthquakes; Electric power plant loads; Loads (forces); Tall buildings; Building structure; Earthquake-resistant buildings; High rise building; High-rise building structure; Lateral displacements; Load distributions; outrigger; Performance of buildings; Structural design",,,,,,"Alok, R., Savita, M., The Behavior of Outrigger Structural System in High-Rise Building: Reviews (2017) International Journal of Science, Engineering and Technology Research (IJSETR); Fauzan, K., Faimun, Tavio, (2017) Desain Modifikasi Struktur Edung Apartemen Gunawangsa Tidar Surabaya Menggunakan Struktur Beton Bertulang Dengan Sistem Outrigger Dan Belt-Truss; Gerasimidis, S., Efthymiou, E., Baniotopoulos, C.C., (2009) Optimum Outrigger Locations of High-Rise Steel Buildings for Wind Loading; Standardisasi Nasional, B., (2012) Tata Cara Perencanaan Ketahanan Gempa Untuk Struktur Bangunan Gedung Dan Non-Gedung; Wai-Ming Ho Arup, G., The Evolution of Outrigger System in Tall Buildings (2016) International Journal of High-Rise Buildings, 5; Wiratman, W., Struktur Unik Gedung MNC Media Tower Bertingkat 56 di Jakarta (2013) Konferensi Nasional Teknik Sipil ke-7","Suangga, M.; Civil Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: suangga@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The lay out of the shear wall is very influential on the performance of the shear wall in receiving lateral forces. To investigate how the shear wall layout affecting the performance of the structure to lateral load, pushover analysis on 27 storey structure with three different shear wall shape is conducted. The three shapes of shear wall layout considered are shear wall with C shape layout, shear wall with I shape lay-out and shear wall with L shape lay-out. The shear capacities of the structure with different shear wall shapes were checked against the design requirement in SNI 1726-2012. ETABS software were used for push over analysis. Their ductility and structural performance level based on the ATC-40 method were compared for both in x direction and y direction. From the results of the pushover over analysis it was found that shear wall with C shape layout is the most favorable since it has the highest structural stiffness and smaller drift. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Capacity Curve; Ductility; Earthquake Load; Pushover Analysis; Shear Wall","Ductility; Earthquakes; Capacity curves; Earthquake load; Lateral force; Lateral loads; Push-over analysis; Shear capacity; Structural performance; Structural stiffness; Shear walls",,,,,,"Nur Afandi, R., Evaluasi Kinerja seismik Struktur Beton dengan analisis pushover menggunakan program SAP2000 (2010) Jurnal Teknik Sipil.

To get a description of the structural behavior starting from the structure in linear elastic, the first yielding of the structural elements until the structure collapse due to earthquake load, it can be done with non-linear static analysis namely pushover analysis. In this study, the geometry of mid-rise reinforced concrete structure consists of four storey buildings. The dimensions of the column structure 400x400 mm and beam structure 250x500 mm, where the dimensions of the beams and columns are the same from the 1st floor to the 4th floor. To find out the behavior that affects the ductility value in mid-rise reinforced concrete structures, a variation material used in this study are the spacing of stirrup, ratio of longitudinal reinforcement, ratio of compressive and tensile longitudinal reinforcement, and compressive strength of concrete. Structural geometry modeling, structural loads, and modeling of material variations used the program SAP 2000. From the output of this program, an analysis of the value of curvature ductility and displacement ductility was performed. The result of this study are the higher the value of compressive strength of concrete and the ratio of longitudinal reinforcement in beam structure will increase the value of ductility.

For the cable-stayed bridge, the cable receives the load from the bridge deck and transfer it to the pylon. As the ambient temperature change, the internal force in bridge element including stayed cable will change. This research investigate the ambient temperature effect to the tension force of stayed cable of cable-stayed bridge by comparing the result of finite element model analysis with the field measurement form electromagnetic sensor data. The finite element model of Merah Putih Cable-Stayed Bridge has been developed based on detailed engineering design data. The finite element model is validated using the natural frequency data from dynamic load test of the bridge. The ambient temperature and bridge elements temperature were measured for 24 hours. The finite element analysis were conducted based on field measurement data and the contribution of pylon and girder temperature to the cable tension forces variation was investigated. The output of finite element analysis then compared to the actual cable tension as measured by an electromagnetic sensor. It was found that the ambient temperature will affecting the magnitude of tension force at stay cable and the variation of cable tension has similar pattern of both from the finite element model and electromagnetic data. As the temperature of bridge element increases or decreases, the bridge will experience a deformation. Since the stay cable connected to the pylon at one side and to the girder at the other side, its will make the stay cable elongated or contracted which in turn will affecting the tension force at stay cable. When evaluating the bridge condition based on the tension force at stay cable, the effect of temperature variation need to be considered. © BEIESP.","Cable; Cable tension; Cable-stayed bridge; Electromagnetic sensor; Finite element method; Temperature",,,,,"Binus University: 12/AKM/PNT/2019","This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Pengaruh Suhu Terhadap Perubahan Gaya di Kabel Jembatan” or “Temperature Effect to Cable Force Variation of Bridge” with contract number: 12/AKM/PNT/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","Chen, C., Wu, W., Liu, C., Effects of temperature variation on cable forces of an extradosed bridge (2012) 6Th European Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring; Vairo, G., Montassar, S., Mechanical modelling of stays under thermal loads (2012) Mechanics, Models and Methods, LNACM, 61, pp. 481-498; Suangga, M., Hidayat, I., Yuliastuti, C., Temperature effect on cable tension forces of cable-stayed bridge (2018) The 2Nd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, , 2018; Wang, L., Wu, Y., Thermal effect on damaged stay-cable (2014) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, 52 (4), pp. 1071-1082; Zhao, Y., Zhao, Y., Sun, C., Wang, Z., Temperature effect on tension forces and frequencies of suspended cables (2014) Proceedings of the 9Th International Conference on Structural Dynamics; Zhou, Y., Sun, L., Sun, S., Temperature field and its effect on a long-span steel cable-stayed bridge based on monitoring data (2013) The Thirteenth East Asia-Pacific Conference on Structural Engineering and Construction, pp. EASEC-13",,,,"Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication",,,,,22498958,,,,"English","Int.

The vibrations occurred at certain wind speed in the first asymmetric torsional mode. Vibration on the hanger is a phenomenon that often occurs especially if the hanger is I-shaped. There are 3 possible reason of the vibration including Vortex Induced Vibration (VIV), Galloping and Flutter. To investigate the phenomena, a finite element analysis of the hanger was conducted by considering the effect of the axial force to the natural frequency of the hanger. The results of the analysis obtained in the form of the natural frequency of the structure in the first asymmetric torsional mode then compared with the frequency of vortex vibrations. It was found that the natural frequency of the structure corresponds to the vortex vibration frequency, and therefore, the hanger vibrated because of Vortex Induced Vibration (VIV). Several alternative solutions to increase Vortex Induced Vibration (VIV) wind speed were considered including improving the shape of the hanger and increasing the hanger’s stiffness by using cable struts. © BEIESP.","Aerodynamic; Hanger; Natural frequency; Steel arch bridge; Vortex induced vibration",,,,,,,"Simiu, E., Scanlan, R.H., (1986) Wind Effects on Structures, pp. 198-247. , 2nd edition, John Wiley & Sons; Liu, M.G., Mou, T.M., Hua, X.G., Chen, Z.Q., Flutter, galloping, and vortex induced vibrations of h-section hangers (2012) China: ASCE Journal of Bridge Engineering, pp. 1-9; Xu, Y.L., (2013) Wind Effects on Cable Supported Bridges, pp. 83-103. , China: Wiley",,,,"Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication",,,,,22498958,,,,"English","Int.

In the design, it has been calculated the maximum load that can be received by each cable based on dead load, live load or environmental load. When the bridge operates, it is necessary to monitor the behavior of the bridge structure due to the work load based on the time function. It is very important for the bridge management to examine the cable forces that occur in real time, so that it can be immediately known if there is a cable force exceeding the maximum limit. One of the sensor tools that can be used to determine the frequency of the cable is accelerometer. The frequency data from accelerometer are calculated into the approach of formulas developed by Wei-Hua Hu, 2005. In this study, calculation cable forces consider the effect of sag cable or bending stiffness using Wei-Hua Hu formula. As a control data in cable force calculations, it used measurement data conducted by consultants. From the results for cable C7 located on left side of bridge needs to be re-tested. This happens because the value of the resulting cable force does not show similarity with the right-side (cable C7 located on right side). The cable C7 in left side of bridge has a frequency value of 1.24 and generate cable forces tends to decrease, where it should be increase for cables forces values. For other cable forces, the value of the cable force obtains a range difference between 0.28% - 9.23%. Longer cable such as cable M7, the cable force formula is less influenced by bending stiffness effects in calculation. In other words, the stiffness of the cable is small or does not affect the cable force. As for shorter cables in cables C2 and M2, the bending stiffness of the cables affects the calculation of the cable force. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The result of the analysis using Finite Element Method then compared with the available field measurement data. To validate the finite element model, the dynamic finite element model of the bridge will be compared with the dynamic properties of the bridge from dynamic testing of actual bridge. It was found from the finite element model that he effects of temperature on the cable force is linear and the girder and pylon stiffness has significant contribution to the variation of cable tension force due to temperature change.

However, some of these bridges are failed due to channel bed degradation and scouring. Bridge scour is one of the main causes of bridge failure. To prevent this condition, it is very crucial to thoroughly understanding the river behavior changes at the upstream and downstream area of bridge and barrage constructions. After that, the proper operation and preventive maintenance of bridges and barrages can be formulated. In this study, we identified the indicator parameters that are associated with hydraulic channel and potentially scour the bridge. The objective of this study is to develop a scouring assessment based on the river flow regime. In the assessment, the structures is the indicators status and the performance of the bridge component which will be measured in order to assess the bridge failures performance, and recommendations are proposed to obtain the results by using visual inspection method. The assessment models is an evaluation of the river regime condition using inspection and other direct measures to determine the effect of river condition related with deterioration. The study result shows that the main component to assess the performance of bridge are hydraulic channel, riverbank, and floodplain.

The study was conducted by traffic count survey and followed by a roadside interview survey. Stated Preference method was used in order to analyse trip forecasting value. Mode choice model of new trip mode plans (Cisumdawu Toll Road) and current intercity road for Cileunyi - Sumedang is (UJT -UJR ) = 0.1079-0.507726x 1-0.8953764x 2, while Sumedang - Cileunyi is (UJT -UJR ) = 0.0790-0.301341x 1-0.548446x 2. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to obtain the forecasting of private vehicle that diverts to the new toll road (Cisumdawu Toll Road). Trip characteristics such as trip origin and destination, types of trips, occupations, salary, and others become a motive for respondents to choose a new trip mode. Results of the new trip mode forecasting that prefer to divert to the toll road in terms of the value of cost and time for Cileunyi - Sumedang are 74.11% and 86.62% respectively, while for Sumedang - Cileunyi are 69.60% and 76.48% respectively. These results are relatively high compare to toll planning document. The impact of this results can be determined such as lower overall fuel consumption, lower pollution and more important is the maintenance cost of national road will be decrease. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","intercity road; multiple linear regression; state preference; toll road","Automobiles; Compensation (personnel); Forecasting; Linear regression; Regression analysis; Roads and streets; Surveys; Toll highways; intercity road; Mode choice models; Multiple linear regression analysis; Multiple linear regressions; Origin and destinations; Private vehicles; state preference; Stated preference method; Transportation",,,,,,"Surbakti, M.S., Bombongan, C., Characteristic of modal choice preference between bus and train from Medan to Kuala Namu airport (2017) IOP.

Cables are used in a variety of structures that employ their unique characteristics to create efficient design tension members. The condition of the cable forces in the cable supported structure is an important indication of judging whether the structure is in good condition. Several methods have been developed to measure on site cable forces. Vibration technique using correlation between natural frequency and cable forces is a simple method to determine in situ cable forces, however the method need accurate information on the boundary condition, cable mass, and cable length. The natural frequency of the cable is determined using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) Technique to the acceleration record of the cable. Based on the natural frequency obtained, the cable forces then can be determine by analytical or by finite element program. This research is focus on the vibration techniques to determine the cable forces, to understand the physical parameter effect of the cable and also modelling techniques to the natural frequency and cable forces. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","cable forces; FFT Technique; natural frequency; vibration","Fast Fourier transforms; Natural frequencies; Cable forces; Cable-supported structure; FFT (fast Fourier transform); FFT techniques; Finite element programs; Modelling techniques; vibration; Vibration techniques; Cables",,,,,,"Casas, J.R., A combined method for measuring cable forces: The cable-stayed Alamillo Bridge, Spain, Structural Enginering International (1994) Journal of the IABSE, 4, pp. 235-240. , November; Debora, S.N., Parivallal, S., Ravisankar, K., Hemalatha, G., Evaluation of Cable Tension Using Vibration Based Methodologies for Health Monitoring of Structures (2015) IJIRSET, 4; Chang, S.-P., Nonlinear Dynamic Analysis of Spatial Suspended Elasti Catenary Cable with Finite Element Method (2008) KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering, 12 (2), pp. 121-128; Alice, E., (2006), Measurement and Evaluation of Cable Forces in the Alvsborg Bridge (Stockholm: Royal Institute of Technology) Master Thesis; Erwin, K., (2006) Advanced Engineering Mathematic, , 9 (Hoboken: Wiley); Steiveman, D.B., (1953), (New York: Wiley amp; Sons Inc) A Practical Treatise on Suspension Bridges; Walther, R., (1988) Cable Stayed Bridges, , (London: L Thomas Telford Ltd) William Crozier, Penerjemah; Hiroki, Y., (1992), (Thailand: Asian Institute of Technology) Structural Dynamics; Rastandi Josia, I., (University of Indonesia) Presentation Material - Presentasi Jembatan Siak III by Dr. Ing","Suangga, M.; Civil Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: suangga@binus.edu","Kasih T.P.","","Institute of Physics Publishing","International Conference on Eco Engineering Development 2017, ICEED 2017","14 November 2017 through 15 November 2017",,133427,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

In this research, type I-Girder WIKA standard for bridges were considered with longitudinal spansof 35 m, transverse spans of 12.4 m, girder heightof2100 mm. The purpose of this study to calculate the deflection and stress at the girder with different standard for Highway Bridge.Three standards considered for this comparison including of Bina Marga, AASHTO, and British Standard.Based on the analysis, it was found that the value of the stress in the Ultimate Limit Stress (ULS) and Service Limit State (SLS)and the value of deflection are still below the allowable values. This indicates that the type I-Girder considered is meet all the criteria implied by the three design standards. The important aspect when designing a prestressed concrete bridge is a combination of loading, the resistance factor, the design criteria, and the limit valueof deflection. The different parameter between the design ctandardis the value of the resistance factor. Bina Marga and AASHTO standards use the resistance factor values of 0.75 and 0.9, while for a British Standard resistant factor is not adopted but the value of material factor (γm) is used with the value of 1.15. The value for short-term lossdue to concrete shortening of Bina Margais equal to zero. This is due to the tendon are tensionedsimultaneously.

The purpose of this research was to perform a comparative analysis of the stress value due to the live load calculation program based on the results of Midas/Civil with the field measurement results and stress sensors determine the effect of the modulus of elasticity of concrete parameters on the stress value of pre-stressed bridge. The method used in this research is the analytical calculations based on actual conditions measured in the field. Loading test method is based on the actual condition of the integrated load testing methods. The results obtained in this research is when the load works right on top of the bridge girder then the stress value will be close to the actual stress value. In the effect analysis of the modulus of elasticity of concrete shows that the modulus does not affect the stress value. Moreover, on the diaphragm modeling workload which is right on top of the girder has less stress value.

PC Bridge girders have two types: Pre - tensioned girders and post - tensioned girders. In pre tensioned girders, prestressing in carried out first then after that the fresh concrete poured. The prestressing process in only carried off after the concrete has sufficient strength. In this study, analysis was conducted for PCI bridge girder with span is 40 meters. Based on the data geometry bridge dimension girder, material girder, and material strands cable, it will be analyzed to calculate the natural frequencies and moment capacity using finite element program (Midas/Civil program). So it can be estimated how much the percentage reduction prestress force on the bridge until PCI bridge structure collapses. From the calculation, it found that the pattern comparison between reduction prestressing force and natural frequency are linear. These results are also similar for natural frequency versus moment capacity.PCI bridge will collapse when the reduction prestreesing force of 45 % to 50 % from the total loss of prestressing. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,,"(2004) Perencanaan Struktur Beton Untuk Jembatan RSNI T-12-2004, , Badan Standarisasi Nasional.

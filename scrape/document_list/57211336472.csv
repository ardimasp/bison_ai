Indonesia as one of the most densely populated countries in the world is in dire need of adequate health service. Various demographic, geographical, and economic conditions lead to incomprehensive health service potentials. This research is to propose integration concept for the existing health service platforms in Indonesia based on SOA (Service Oriented Architecture). The Smart healthcare system integration is called MedicForMe. This research was conducted using Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method with the results of research in the form of a rich picture concept, a SOA layer diagram consisted of 8 services including: hospital, pharmacy, health ministry, delivery service, payment gateway, online healthcare platform, location mapping, and insurance. © BEIESP.","Healthcare system; Integration; Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)",,,,,,"https://www.bps.go.id/statictable/2014/02/18/1274/proyeksi-pendudukmenurut-provinsi-2010---2035.html; (2016), ministry of health RI; Abukhousa, E., Mohamed, N., Al-Jaroodi, J., E-Health Cloud: Opportunities and Challenges (2012) Future Internet, 4 (3), pp. 621-645. , https://doi.org/10.3390/fi4030621; The internet of things in healthcare: An overview.

At present the community must pay for the cost of rubbish, whereas rubbish can be useful and profitable if managed properly. One way to manage waste properly is to save waste at the Trash Bank. At present there are already several garbage banks established, but the garbage banks that have been run are not yet optimal, not all people use these facilities. Lack of knowledge and infrastructure facilities hamper the waste management process at the garbage bank. Therefore, the authors propose the concept of an integrated system based on service oriented architecture (SOA) to integrate garbage pickup services, banks, garbage banks, cooperatives, gas, electricity, cable tv, public relations, e-commerce and health insurance as a means of supporting infrastructure to support waste management. The method in this study uses Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The results of this study are in the form of a waste management application design: Go-Waste which integrates waste pick-up service, banks, garbage banks, cooperatives, gas, electricity, cable tv, public relations, e-commerce and health insurance in one platform using a service oriented architecture (SOA). © BEIESP.","Garbage bank; Service-oriented architecture (SOA); Waste management service information system",,,,,,"(2018), www.menlhk.go.id; (2018), www.litbang.kemendagri.go.id; Erl, T., (2005) Service-Oriented Architecture: Concepts, Technology, and Design, , Prentice Hall PTR; Walean, D.D., Sistem Informasi Akademik Berbasis Web Mobile Menggunakan ASP.NET (Studi Kasus Teknik Elektro UNSRAT) (2011) Manado.

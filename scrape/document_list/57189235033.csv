Income smoothing is one of earnings management methods by reducing fluctuations in earnings to make it look stable, because relatively stable earnings are preferred by investors. This study examines the debt to equity variable and the size of the company which according to previous studies have different results between one researcher with another related to the effect on income smoothing. Debt to equity is measured using a comparison of total debt with total capital and company size is measured using total assets. This study uses empirical data from the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) with a sample of 16 companies from the property and real estate sector selected from 46 companies. The analytical method used is the t test for two free samples and multiple linear regression. The results showed that the debt to equity variable and company size did not have a significant difference between the income grading company and the non-income grading company so that the two variables could not be used as indicators that were associated with the actions of companies that did income smoothing. In addition, based on the results of the study also found that the variable debt to equity and company size do not have a significant effect on income smoothing practices. © 2019 by Advance Scientific Research.

One source of PAD comes from motorised vehicle tax. Motorised vehicle tax is a tax on ownership and/or control of motorised vehicles. So far, this tax has not been optimal in receipt, and there is an indication of non-compliance of taxpayers in paying taxes. Persuasive efforts are still being carried out by the government so that the public grows their awareness in paying taxes, and it is suspected that tax service factors, taxpayers' awareness, and illegal levies are factors causing compliance of the taxpayer in paying motorised vehicle tax. The research method used was quantitative research. In this study, the type and source of data used was secondary data published by certain agencies and primary data which were a sample of 120 taxpayers from two regions, Bengkalis and Siak. The analytical tool used was Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The results showed it was proven that the variables of taxation services, taxpayers' awareness, and illegal levies simultaneously had a significant effect on taxpayer compliance in paying motorised vehicle tax. Some people still do not understand tax payment procedures. Thus, they often postponed the payments. The delay also occurred because the work days of workers from communities around the location of the oil palm plantations were from Monday to Friday so they did not have time to make payments. The results of the study also found awareness and illegal levies were also factors in the decline in compliance. The recommendation of this study is the Government provides payment counters on Saturdays and Sundays in the plantation area by placing Mobil Samsat Keliling (service given by using a car as payment counters). Then, attaching the procedure of tax payments and its requirments on the sheet of Vehicle Registration Certificate (STNK) or motorised vehicle tax (PKB) of each owner of a two-wheeled motorised vehicle when buying the motorised vehicle or when paying the tax. It will encourage the compliance of taxpayers of plantation sector in paying motorised vehicle tax, and it later can increase Local Own-Source Revenue (PAD) of the Riau Province. © 2020 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Compliance; Illegal levies; Local own-source revenue (PAD); Tax; Two-wheeled motorised vehicles",,,,,,"The author would like to thank the University of Riau for providing DIPA Research Grants from the 2019 Higher Education Applied Research Scheme (PTUPT).","Agustiningsih, W., Isroah, I., Pengaruh Penerapan E-Filing, Tingkat Pemahaman Perpajakan Dan Kesadaran Wajib Pajak Terhadap Kepatuhan Wajib Pajak Di KPP Pratama Yogyakarta (2016) Nominal, Barometer Riset Akuntansi dan Manajemen, 5 (2); Anam, M.C., Andini, R., Hartono, H., Pengaruh Kesadaran Wajib Pajak, Pelayanan Fiskus Dan Sanksi Pajak Terhadap Kepatuhan Wajib Pajak Orang Pribadi Yang Melakukan Kegiatan Usaha Dan Pekerjaan Bebas Sebagai Variabel Intervening (Studi di KPP Pratama Salatiga).

This study aims to design a quality accounting information system model needed by small and medium micro businesses i n order to assist business operations. This research is a research and development research with the method of devel oping rapid application development (RAD) which consists of three phases that require planning, RAD workshop design and implementation. Data collection techniques used were interviews, observation, documentation, literature study. The results of this study indicate that small and medium micro businesses in Indonesia still use manual cash receipt accounting information systems. Documents used in the form of cash notes and invoices, while the notes made are records of ca sh sales, accounts receivable, and inve ntory. However, recording is not done routinely so that financial information / reports are inaccurate. Designing a quality a ccounting information system can simplify and speed up the making of financial statements. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

This literature study explains and describes the evolution of accounting information systems. An organization can run well if the system has integrity properly. Accounting information systems are expected in an organization to be an integrated system that supports each other activities related to corporate financial transactions. Accounting information systems are used to collect, store, and process financial data, and also to produce information reports that can be used by managers or other parties in making business decisions. Information systems are formal processes for collecting data, processing data into information, and distributing that information to users. This study aims to describe the evolution of accounting information systems. This study concluded that accounting information systems underwent an evolution from electronic data processing, management information systems, decision support systems and officice automation and artificial intelligence. © 2019 International Journal Of Scientific and Technology Research.

The process of finding information can be done by a method of grouping data into several groups from a data set that is in data mining called the clustering method. Data mining is defined as a method of finding information that is hidden in a database that is large and difficult to obtain by using only ordinary queries. Unit Implementation and Testing, software design is a series of programs or program units. Then unit testing involves verifying that each program unit meets its specifications (Sommerville, 2003). Programs should be released after they are developed, tested to correct errors found in their quality guarantee testing (Padmini, 2005). There are two testing methods, namely: (1) The white box method is a test that focuses on the internal logic of the software (program source code); (2) The black box method is to provide actual results in accordance with the results needed. In the testing phase, the author conducted a black box method that tests the functionality of the software alone without having to know the internal structure of the program (source code). © 2019 International Journal Of Scientific and Technology Research.

This model is then continually improved until it is according to user needs.The application of the system is important for the information system developer in assessing the success of the information system whether it runs according to the plan and whether it has fulfilled the wishes of its users. Unclear planning and analysis often creates problems that will affect development activities. This study will provide an overview of the use of prototyping models in information system development activities in the hope of producing a prototype as one of the first steps in developing an information system. Protype is created with the aim of providing equal perception and initial understanding of the basic processes of the system to be developed, so that there will be good communication between developers and system users. © 2019 International Journal Of Scientific and Technology Research.

In accounting, it is defined as the liability of a business entity or company to a third party that is paid by submitting assets or services within a specified period of time as a result of past transactions. The economic sacrifice can take the form of surrendering money, other assets, services or doing certain jobs. Transaction actions can be in the form of receipt of money, goods or services, acknowledged a cost or loss. Obligations result in a bond that gives the creditor the right to claim company assets. Obligations can usually be determined in amount or easily estimated or expressed in units of money. Obligations are funding sources originating from creditors. In a company's balance sheet, the account is combined with the amount of liabilities plus capital or owner's investment. © 2019 International Journal Of Scientific and Technology Research.

Basically, IT Audit can be divided into two categories, namely Application Control and General Control. General control objectives further guarantee the integrity of the data contained in computer �systems and at the same time ensure the integrity of the program or application used to process data. Meanwhile, the purpose of controlling the application is intended to ensure that the data is correctly input into the application, processed correctly, and that there are adequate controls on the output produced. In audits of applications, typically, checks on general controls are also carried out given that general controls contribute to the effectiveness of application controls. In practice, the stages in IT audits are not different from audits in general. The planning stage, as an introduction, is absolutely necessary so that the auditor knows the object to be examined properly. In addition, of course, auditors can ensure that qualified resources are already owned, in this case experienced aspects of HR and also references to best practices. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

Therefore, the management of information is seen as important for the smooth running of a job and for analyzing the development of the work itself. This requires learning Management Information Systems in creating, distributing and utilizing information to support management activities, especially decision making in public policy. However, unfortunately many organizations want to build their own Management Information Systems, and have provided sufficient funds, but it turns out that these businesses often fail.

Therefore, the study recommends that the government need to enhance trade based on renewable and green technology. Also, the government can adopt a green transportation system such as hybrid vehicles for the logistics and shipping the good from one place to another place. © 2019, Czestochowa University of Technology.

The role of Information Systems as a tool in carrying out business activities becomes very necessary. When the stages of this process do not go well and correctly it will cause delays or irregularities and inefficiencies. To improve the processes that are already running, business process reengineering can be used. With this re-engineering, a new innovation can be done in a business where old habits can be abandoned and start with a new, better process. The use of information systems that will be reviewed in this discussion is related to the use of information technology in the renovation of global innovation. The rapid development of information technology has triggered new innovations that can help facilitate information. And this encourages companies to carry out renovations and innovations in the processes of production, sales, marketing, and distribution by involving the role of information technology. The use of information technology in business facilitates every business person and creates efficiency and effectiveness for the company so that by using information technology the company is able to create competitive advantages and be able to compete in the global market. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

Computer ethics is very important because people have certain perceptions and fears with the use of computers. The features of computer use that are worrying to the public are the ability to program computers to do anything, the fact that computers can change everyday life and the fact that what a computer does may not be visible to people who are victims. Society in general gives attention mainly because of the awareness that computers can interfere with individual privacy rights, property and access. Whereas in the business world, one of the main reasons for this concern is the problem of software piracy that can significantly reduce the revenue of software sellers. But the subject of computer ethics is deeper than privacy and piracy. Computers are powerful social equipment, which can help or disturb the community in many ways, all of which depend on how they are used.

For doing this purpose, the current study examines the impact of environmental requirement (REQ) and environmental capability on ALI of AIS. Furthermore, the study investigates the effect of environmental ALI on firm PER and environmental PER. The current study is conducted in the small-medium enterprises in Indonesia. The results of structural equation modeling confirm that EAIS REQ and EAIS capability have a positive and significant impact on EAIS ALI. Moreover, the results also confirm that EAIS ALI has a positive and significant impact on firm PER and environmental PER in Indonesia. Alongside, the study also implies that the responsiveness of the organization towards environmental needs is critical not only to the nature but to the organization itself in building corporate image, sustainable practices and certifications that enhance organization repute and managers understanding of the environmental need along with improved societal commitments. © 2019, Econjournals.

The findings of confirmatory factor analysis lead to conclude that the conceptual model fulfills the goodness of fit criteria.

In doing so, the authors aim to examine the contribution of organization’s reputation in driving firm’s environmental performance. Furthermore, the contribution of the current study is extended to study the crucial role of green intellectual capital in influencing sustainable performance. In this regard, the study measures intellectual capital in the form of green human capital, green social capital and green relational capital in realizing their impact on firm’s environmental performance. Confronting the patterns of strict natural traditions and prominent ecological awareness, organizations ought not freeze or overcompensate from the existing ecological regulations as these natural patterns could be moved toward the green practice that may drive them to convey sustainable development and bring consensus in the environmental and organizational objectives. Unlike viewing ecological policies as hindrances of firm’s future improvement, the findings of the current study concentrate on finding the right assessment of intangible resources in carrying efficiency in firm’s course of sustainable practices by evaluating its impact on environmental performance. The results of PLS-SEM confirm that organizational reputation and green intellectual capital have positive and significantly influenced on environmental performance. The results of partial least square structural equation modelling confirm that a unit increase in green intellectual capital bring 0.449 unit increase in environmental performance of multinational firms in Indonesia. Moreover, a unit increase in organizational reputation also brings positive increase by 0.424 unit in environmental performance in Indonesia multinational firms. © 2019, Econjournals.

Audit develops, from financial audits to other types of audits, such as management, operational, performance, quality, environment, human resources, information technology audits and others. To state the level of conformity, the auditor requires the collection and testing of audit evidence. Audit evidence can be in the form of physical evidence, documentary evidence, testimony evidence, and analyst evidence. The increasing use of information technology/computers in data processing organizations has made changes in the form of audit evidence. If audit evidence as a result of a computer process cannot be seen then it is impractical for the auditor to do manual testing, so that the auditor must consider the use of Computer Assisted Audit Techniques. © 2018, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

Strategies that can be taken include moving risk to other parties, avoiding risks, reducing the negative effects of risk, and accommodating some or all of the consequences of certain risks. Financial risk management, on the other hand, focuses on risks that can be managed using financial instruments. The goal of implementing risk management is to reduce the different risks associated with the chosen field at a level acceptable to the community. This can be in the form of various types of threats caused by the environment, technology, people, organizations and politics.

It reflects how the Westerners view the Easterners. The title of the study aims to explore the concept of Orientalism from a selected western novel by Updike entitled Terrorist. The novel portrays the image of a Muslim-Arab character; Ahmad who is the protagonist of the novel Terrorist. The paper also shows how Muslim-Arabs are drawn to terrorism not because of their nature which are prone to terrorist acts but are due to the misinterpretation of the Holy Quran. The paper consists of three sections: the first section is an introduction about Updike's Terrorist The second section tackles the different viewpoints pertaining to the concept of Orientalism. Section three analyses Updike's novel as an Orientalist novel. Finally, the conclusion and recommendation for further studies are forwarded. © 2018, Universidad del Zulia.

Pattimura No. 20, Jakarta, Indonesia","Indonesia is the world's largest archipelago with many major rivers in the big islands of Sumatera, Kalimantan, and Java. As part of its road network, major bridges are constructed to cross these rivers. Considering the span of the bridges and its aesthetic point of view, the application of Long Span Steel Truss Bridges in Indonesia is very popular among others. Its span varies from 70 to 270 meters in length. For long span bridges, aerodynamics is an important aspect for the design and construction of the bridges. In order to ensure the stability of the bridges against the aerodynamic effect of the wind, wind tunnel study and test has been conducted for most of the bridges. This paper presents the parameter and characteristic of several Long Span Steel Truss Bridges in Indonesia, i.e. Tayan Kapuas Bridge, Musi VI Bridge, New Kutai Kartanegara Bridges and Teluk Mesjid Bridge. The bridges will be assessed against BD 49/01. Parameters and assessment results are then compared with wind tunnel results. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,"Aerodynamic stability; Steel bridges; Tantalum compounds; Trusses; Wind tunnels; Aero-dynamic performance; Aerodynamic effect; Design and construction; Kalimantan; Long-span bridge; Major bridges; Road network; Steel truss bridge; Aerodynamics",,,,,"(2001), BD 49/01 Design Rules for Aerodynamic Effects on Bridges; Eaddy, M., Melbourne, W.H., (2008) Wind Tunnel Tests on A Sectional Model of the Teluk Masjid Bridge Indonesia, MEL Consultant Report; (2008), Laboratorium Aero-gas Dinamika dan Getaran Laporan Pengujian Sectional Model Jembatan Tayan-Kapuas; (2008) Laporan Analisa Mode Shape Jembatan Teluk Mesjid Provinsi Riau, , Departemen Pekerjaan Umum Direktorat Jenderal Bina Marga Direktorat Bina Teknik Sub Direktorat Teknik Jembatan; (2013) Report on Wind Tunnel Check Jembatan Kutai Kartanegara-Laporan Akhir, , PT Adiyasa Desicon; (2014) Draft Pedoman Pelaksanaan Uji Angin Pada Jembatan, , Departemen Pekerjaan Umum Direktorat Jenderal Bina Marga; (2016) Dan Aeroakustika (BBTA3) BPPT, Laporan Pengujian Terowongan Angin Jembatan Musi VI, , Balai Besar Teknologi Aerodinamika Aeroelastika; Permana, R., Andika, M., Syariefatunnisa, Risdhiawan, E., Hermawan, B., Noordiana, I., (2017) Wind Tunnel Test of Musi VI Bridge, Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Construction and Building Engineering, pp. 0200051-0200057","Made, S.; Civil Engineering Department, Jl.

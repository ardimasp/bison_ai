The research was conducted on three main materials required in producing spring and sponge mattresses. Using Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model to analyze historical demand on main materials, it is proven that with EOQ model the company can save by more than 45% from procuring and inventory costs of those materials. The research continues to forecast the sales demand to get the annual requirement of materials needed in 2014 and calculate the EOQ model again. The results show that, comparing with traditional practice done by company, EOQ model can reduce costs up to 118 million rupiah per year. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

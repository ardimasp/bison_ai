Moreover, current system uses two separated devices for a single purpose which consumes more power. This research develops a GPS tracking system which provides real time current position information by using High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) and Enhance Data for Global System for Mobile Communication Evolution (EDGE) technology, and uses a single device to obtain and send its location. The system was designed to send and track data by which the stability, the level of system response, and the availability of the system were continually measured. The experiment result showed that the mean interval for updating data under HSDPA connection was better than EDGE. By using HSDPA, it was observed that the fastest interval recorded in the database was 1 second. Additionally, the tracking operation could be done between Android devices and web based system simultaneously, by which the receiver could also be used as the coordinate sender and the sender could also be used as the coordinate receiver. © 2015 IIJ.","Android based; EDGE; GPS; HSDPA; Mobile network",,,,,,"El-Rabbany, A., Introduction to GPS: The Global Positioning System (2002) Artech House, Inc., , Norwood; Grewal, M.S., Weill, R.L., Andrews, A.P., Global Positioning Systems (2007), Inertial Navigation, and Integration, 2nd edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New Jersey; Dixon, T.H., An Introduction to the Global Positioning Systems and Some Geological Applications (1991) Reviews of Geophysics, 29 (2), pp. 249-276; Leick, A., GPS Satellite Surveying (2004), 3rd edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New Jersey; Alde, A., Landge, D., Kadam, P., GPS-Global Positioning System & Its Application (2011) International Journal of Functional and Logical Programming, 1 (1), pp. 01-03; Raskovic, D., Giessel, D., Battery-Aware Embedded GPS Receiver Node (2007) 4th Annual International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Networking & Services (MobiQuitous 2007), pp. 1-6. , Aug; Tang, B.Z., Longfield, S., Bhave, S.A., Manohar, R., A Low Power Asynchronous GPS Baseband Processor (2012) 18th IEEE International Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems (ASYNC), pp. 33-40. , May; Jalili, H., Fotowat-Ahmady, A., A Low-Power Current Reuse CMOS RF Front-End for GPS Applications (2011) IEEE International RF and Microwave Conference (RFM), pp. 416-419. , Dec; Moloo, R.K., Digumber, V.K., Low-Cost Mobile GPS Tracking Solution (2011) International Conference on Business Computing and Global Information, pp. 516-519; DuBois, P., MySQL: Developer's Library (2008), 4th edition, Pearson Education; Greenspan, J., Bulger, B., MySQL/PHP Database Applications (2001), M&T Books, Foster City; (2010), Anonymous, Data Analysis, General Books; Robusto, C.C., The Cosine-Haversine Formula (1957) The American Mathematical Monthly, 64 (1), pp. 38-40",,,,"Internetworking Indonesia",,,,,19429703,,,,"English","Internetworking Indones.

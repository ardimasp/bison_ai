Indonesia has a various number of local patterns, but the well-known pattern is usually printed on Indonesian textiles. The students have difficulties in creating new pattern influenced by Indonesian local pattern to be applied in their interior design project. In addition, they lack information about the meaning of local pattern from Indonesia. Therefore, they tend to avoid use pattern in their design or use it without any reference. This research collected and analyzed the pattern in interior and architectural building in Indonesia, starting from the east islands of Indonesia, city of Padang, West Sumatra; it continued to Java Island, started with the city of Cirebon, West Java. This Study adds new references for the students to learn about the originality of Indonesian pattern, especially finishing elements of interior and architectural. The result of this study is a list of the pattern from Padang and Cirebon, complete with its meaning and background influence. Indonesian pattern is influenced by the local culture philosophy and religion brought by the trader from Europe, Arabia, and surrounding Asia in the 18th century. Since then it has repeatedly been used in various building type. To conclude, a clear data about the history and meaning of ornaments can help to determine the correct placement of decoration. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Indonesia; Interior; Pattern",,,,,,"Roojen, P.V., (2006) Batik Design, , Batik Design.

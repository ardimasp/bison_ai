Eighty-five fifth-grade students were assigned to either an experimental or control Logo group. They were pre-tested to assess baseline receptiveness to figural and logical word problem-solving skills. After eight weeks of learning, the Logo experimental group had significantly higher scores than the control group on the problem-solving skills tests (assessing both figural and logical word problem-solving skills). The result revealed significant differences in the figural problem-solving skill between the Logo experimental and control groups. An implication was that Logo programming exercised skills are more critical and relevant to the figural problem-solving skill. Possible alternative explanations and suggestions are provided for future research endeavors. © Wydawnictwo Adam Marszałek Toruń 2015.","Figural; Logical word; Logo; Problem solving; Programming language",,,,,,"Joshi, A.B., Gaikwad, S.R., (2012) Logo Programming (Part 2)-A Creative and Fun Way to Learn Mathematics and Problem Solving (2 Ed), , Phune: SPARK Institute; Battista, M.J., Clements, D.H., Research into Practice: Constructing Geometric Concepts in Logo (1990) Arithmetic Teacher, pp. 15-17; Clement, D.H., Logo and cognition: A Theorical Foundation (1986) Computers in Human Behavior, 2 (2), pp. 95-110; Clement, D.H., Gullo, D.F., Effect of Computer Programming on Young Children Cognition (1984) J.

The research firm emarketer said that the population netter in Indonesia reached 83.7 million people in 2014, and in 2017 is estimated to reach 112 million people. pt. xyz is a company with business in telecommunications by providing data services as one of its business processes. But in that business process, often the emergence of an incident which resulted in delays in the services provided. Therefore this study was conducted to evaluate the incident management process applied by the company in conducting prevention/resolution of the incident. Incidents that use in this research is incident that cause interference in data service (internet) were received by users or result in failure of the system in the internal unit. ITIL incident management metrics supposed to be measured processes of incident management companies currently doing a resolution of an incident. itil is used as a guideline in the implementation and evaluation for lifecycle incident management process. the result is metrics kpi incident management is meet the target of resolution time but there are some points that need to be improved, such as the involvement of service desk that only 8% of the total incidents were resolved and the handling of incidents with the level of emergency and critical severity level. © 2017 IEEE.","Data services; Incident; Incident management; ITIL","Microcellular radio systems; Web services; Business Process; Data services; Incident; Incident Management; Incident management process; ITIL; Resolution time; Telecommunication operators; Telecommunication services",,,,,"Eason, G., Noble, B., Sneddon, I.N., On certain integrals of lipschitz-hankel type involving products of bessel functions (1955) Phil.

The method used in this research is quantitative method with a descriptive approach. Using analytical hierarchy process as the data processing method to determine the weight that is calculated on the balanced scorecard, the result found that company needs to improve its quality of service by repairing all matters relating to any outside party or consumers. The company also needs to pay attention to the work disciplinary that can be formed directly by regulation, training and the establishment of a conducive working environment. Increasing the work discipline will improve the quality of service of the parties within company to their customers. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Balanced scorecard; Measurement; Performance",,,,,,"Atkinson, A.A., Kaplan, S.R., Matsumura, E.M., Young, S.M., (2012) Management Accounting, , 6th edn., Pearson Education, Inc., New Jersey; Maryam, Shojaee, (2012) Strategic Planning for a Lubricant Manufacturing, , Company, Iran; Mitchell, S.A., (2012) Empowering People, , Yogyakarta, Konisius; Sekaran, U., Bougie, R., (2013) Research Methods for Business, , Wiley, United Kingdom; (2005) Introduction to Information Technology, , Turban, John Wiley, USA; Domanovic, V., (2012) African Journal of Business Management, 6, p. 23; Garcia, P., (2013) Global Journal of Business Research, 7, p. 4; Kairu, E.W., (2013) European Journal of Business and Management, 5, p. 9; Poureisa, A., (2013) Interdisciplinary Journal of Contemporary Research in Business, 5, p. 1; Sulisworo, D., Nurmaningsih, S., (2011) Jurnal Ilmiah Teknik Industri, 10, p. 1; Sulisworo, D., Darmawati, D., (2011) Indian Journal of Commerce and Management Studies, p. 11; Karami, A., Dolatabadi, H.R., Rajaeepour, S., (2013) International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences, , September 3; Grant, L., Proctor, T., (2011) Nursing Times, 107, p. 22","Sanny, L.; School of Business Management, Indonesia",,,"American Scientific Publishers",,,,,19366612,,,,"English","Adv.

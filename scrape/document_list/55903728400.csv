The use of Six Sigma method with DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) is expected to increase sigma level. Pareto diagram, Ishikawa diagram, and why-why analysis were utilized as tools to analyze the cause of defects on products. Three major packaging defects were identified, namely horizontal leak, folded, and vertical leaks, which were caused by machine A, machine B, machine C, respectively. Based on the results of the analysis, the main problem was caused by inappropriate condition of the machine part such as dirty sealer, hollow on nozzle, and worn stator pump. By focusing on improvements of the problem, sigma level increased from 4.58 to 4.79. Therefore, periodic maintenance activities are important to do so that all machines may perform in its best conditions and comply with internal and regulatory quality standards. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","DMAIC; Leaking; Quality; Six Sigma; Sweetened Condensed Milk Sachets","Defects; Image quality; Process monitoring; Six sigma; Work simplification; Condensed milk; Corrective actions; Define , measure , analyze , improve , and controls; DMAIC; Leaking; Packaging defects; Periodic maintenance; Six sigma methods; Process engineering",,,,,,"Rapaka, M.P., Six sigma methods and formulas for successful quality management (2017) Int.

In this study, encapsulation of freeze-dried sidat eel meat (EM) by biopolymers such as maltodextrin (MD) and and gum Arabic (GA) was examined to find the most effective method to retain its albumin content. Emulsion of biopolymers with a constant weight ratio percentage of 8.00% (w/w, coating material/sidat eel meat) and four different proportions of MD and GA were prepared using a homogenizer, followed by freeze-drying. The 4 different proportions were named T1 (EM 92% + GA 5.33% + MD 2.67%), T2 (EM 92% + GA 2.91% + MD 5.09%), T3 (EM 92% + GA 2.00% + MD 6.00%) and T4 (EM 92% + GA 1.52% + MD 6.46%), respectively. Powders were characterized for its physico-chemical characteristics including colour measurements, moisture content, water solubility, and retention of albumin content. It was observed that T4 consisting of EM with addition of GA (1.52%) and MD (6.46%) as coating materials retained the highest amount of albumin. The encapsulation efficiency were positively influenced by moisture content, solubility and colour measurement differences. To conclude, a mixture of gum Arabic and maltodextrin as coating materials was efficient to retain albumin in EM freeze-drying encapsulation.

Previous research on co-inoculation of Rhizopus oligosporus together with lactic acid bacteria in tempeh making showed promising results as lactic acid bacteria did not inhibit the growth of Rhizopus oligosporus. The aims of this study are to analyze the bioactivities (antioxidative and hepatoprotective activities) of single- and co-inoculated tempeh compared to pre-fermented soybean. Experiments was conducted by observing the effect of different lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus casei) on antioxidant capacities. Afterwards, one of lactic acid bacteria strain will be used to produce tempeh and the protective activity against di(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP)-injured FL83B cell was observed. The result showed that Lactobacillus plantarum co-inoculated tempeh had the highest ferrous ion chelating activity, while Lactobacillus casei co-inoculated tempeh had the highest radical scavenging acticity and reducing power. Moreover, genistein and daidzein, aglycone isoflavone, found highest in Lactobacillus bulgaricus co-inoculated tempeh. For hepatoprotective activity, Lactobacillus plantarum co-inoculated and single-inoculated tempeh had protective activities against DEHP-injured FL83B cell, while soybean has no significant protective effect. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The present study focused on investigating the effects of the natural compounds oleanolic acid (OA) and ursolic acid (UA) on proliferation and differentiation of human APL HL-60 cells in vitro and murine APL WEHI-3 cells in vivo. Results demonstrated that OA and UA significantly inhibited cellular proliferation of HL-60 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Non-cytotoxic concentration of OA exhibited a marked differentiation-inducing effect on HL-60 and enhanced ATRA-induced HL-60 differentiation. In contrast, UA showed only a moderate effect. Activation of MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway was likely found to be involved in the mechanism. Moreover, OA increased survival duration of WEHI-3 transplanted BALB/c mice, and decreased leukemia cells infiltration in the liver and spleen. Thus, these results may provide new insight for developing alternative therapy in APL patients. Copyright© 2015 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.

Rehder (ABH) for angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory (ACEI) activity. Among these compounds, (+)-hopeaphenol and (+)-vitisin A showed the lowest IC50 values (~1.5μM) toward ACE. In addition, the compounds' abundances and distributions in ABH were profiled using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Interestingly, trimers and tetramers of resveratrol were mainly obtained from the bark of ABH when 90% ethanol was used for extraction. This result implies that the antihypertension effect of ABH extract may be mainly contributed by (+)-hopeaphenol (F1) and (+)-vitisin A (F2) in the ABH bark due to their remarkable ACE inhibitions. Moreover, the sizes and structures of these compounds were further correlated to their affinities toward ACE using molecular docking calculations. The results showed that resveratrol tetramers interact with ACE more favorably than other smaller oligomers. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Ampelopsis brevipedunculata var. hancei; Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE); LC-MS/MS; Molecular docking; Oligostilbenes","alcohol; ampelopsin a; ampelopsin b; ampelopsin c; Ampelopsis brevipedunculata var. hancei extract; captopril; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; epsilon viniferin; hopeaphenol; oligomer; plant extract; resveratrol; resveratroloside; stilbene; tetramer; unclassified drug; vitisin a; vitisin b; vitisinol a; biological product; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; stilbene derivative; Ampelopsis; Ampelopsis brevipedunculata var. hancei; antihypertensive activity; Article; assay; bark; calculation; controlled study; drug inhibition; drug isolation; drug screening; drug structure; enzyme inhibition; human; kinetics; liquid chromatography; molecular docking; priority journal; tandem mass spectrometry; Ampelopsis; chemistry; comparative study; IC50; isolation and purification; procedures; Ampelopsis; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Biological Products; Chromatography, Liquid; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Molecular Docking Simulation; Stilbenes; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",,"alcohol, 64-17-5; captopril, 62571-86-2; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, 9015-82-1; resveratrol, 501-36-0; stilbene, 588-59-0; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Biological Products; resveratrol; Stilbenes",,,"This work was financially supported by Taiwan NSC grants (NSC 102-2113-M-020-001-MY2 and NSC 102-2923-B-020-001-MY2 for Dr. Jue-Liang Hsu; NSC 98-2313-B-020-010 and NSC 99-2313-B-020-004-MY3 for Dr. Chi-I Chang; and NSC 102-2811-B-020-005 for Dr. Robert Doerksen, who thanks National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, College of Agriculture for their hospitality).

The IC50 value of IVR was measured in vitro as low as 0.81 ± 0.03 μM, and its inhibition type was suggested as competitive according to the Lineweaver-Burk plot. This peptide can be generated from either thermolysin followed by trypsin digestion (two stages) or only trypsin digestion (one stage). Quantitative LC-MS/MS analysis indicated that two-stage digestion gave 3.14 ± 0.17 mg of IVR from 1 g of SSTEW, better than that from one-stage digestion (1.31 ± 0.12 mg). In vivo antihypertensive activity of the tripeptide IVR after single oral administration (0.1 and 1 mg/kg of body weight) led to a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure 2-4 h after administration in spontaneously hypertensive rats. In addition, the binding mechanism of IVR has been rationalized through docking simulations using the testicular ACE (tACE)-lisinopril complex at 2 A˚ resolution (PDB 108A). The best docking pose was located at the tACE catalytic site resembling the mode of inhibition exerted by lisinopril, an effective hypertensive synthetic drug. The degree of inhibition of this peptide correlated with the H-bond interaction between the C-terminal of IVR and Lys511 and Tyr520 residues of tACE, a significant inhibitor registration for lisinopril. This study illustrated that IVR behaves as a transition-state analogue inhibitor and is useful in therapeutic intervention for blood pressure control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an efficient ACE-inhibitory tripeptide generated from the unfertilized egg of soft-shelled turtle. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","ACE inhibitor; LC-MS/MS; Lysozyme C; Soft-shelled turtle egg; Tripeptide","Blood pressure; Peptides; ACE inhibitors; Angiotensin-converting enzyme; Anti-hypertensive activities; Isolation and characterization; LC-MS/MS; Soft-shelled turtle egg; Spontaneously hypertensive rats; Tripeptide; Enzymatic hydrolysis; Pelodiscus sinensis; Rattus; Trionychidae; antihypertensive agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; egg white; peptide; trypsin; animal; biocatalysis; blood pressure; chemistry; human; hypertension; isolation and purification; kinetics; male; metabolism; molecular docking; pathophysiology; rat; spontaneously hypertensive rat; turtle; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Animals; Antihypertensive Agents; Biocatalysis; Blood Pressure; Egg White; Humans; Hypertension; Kinetics; Male; Molecular Docking Simulation; Peptides; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Rats; Rats, Inbred SHR; Trypsin; Turtles",,"dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, 9015-82-1; egg white, 9006-50-2; trypsin, 9002-07-7; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Antihypertensive Agents; Peptides; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Trypsin",,,,"Basu, S., Millett, C., Social epidemiology of hypertension in middle-income countries: Determinants of prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and control in the WHO SAGE study (2013) Hypertension, 62, pp. 18-26; Quist, E.E., Phillips, R.D., Saalia, F.K., Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory activity of proteolytic digests of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) flour (2009) LWT - Food Sci.

Peptides with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory (ACEI) activity from these fractions were screened. A lysozyme-derived peptide, IW-11, from the fraction with the most effective ACEI was identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and its purified form showed effective ACEI activity in vitro (IC50=4.39±0.31μM). The Lineweaver-Burk plots indicated that the inhibition towards ACE caused by this peptide is a competitive inhibition. The molecular docking study further revealed that the ACEI activity of IW-11 is mainly attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the N-terminal residue of IW-11 and the S1 pocket (Ala354 and Tyr523) and the S2' region (His513 and His353) of ACE. Moreover, the digestion parameters were further optimized and the target peptide (82% purity) was readily obtained (15% yield) without any cumbersome purification procedure. Notably, lysozyme C is the most abundant protein in SSTEW, which implies that an efficient production of this ACEI peptide from SSTEW is promising. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","ACE inhibitory peptide; Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE); Chinese soft-shelled turtle egg; LC-MS/MS; Lysozyme C","alanine; captopril; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; egg protein; histidine; hydrogen; iw 11; lysozyme; lysozyme C; peptide; peptide hydrolase inhibitor; soft shelled turtle egg white protein; thermolysin; tyrosine; unclassified drug; amino terminal sequence; animal shell; article; Chinese; competitive inhibition; controlled study; drug determination; drug screening; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; human; hydrogen bond; IC 50; in vitro study; liquid chromatography; liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry; molecular docking; priority journal; protein analysis; protein degradation; protein metabolism; protein purification; protein targeting; reversed phase liquid chromatography; tandem mass spectrometry; turtle; ACE inhibitory peptide; Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE); Chinese soft-shelled turtle egg; LC-MS/MS; Lysozyme C; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Animals; Egg Proteins; Humans; Peptides; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Turtles",,"alanine, 56-41-7, 6898-94-8; captopril, 62571-86-2; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, 9015-82-1; histidine, 645-35-2, 7006-35-1, 71-00-1; hydrogen, 12385-13-6, 1333-74-0; lysozyme, 9001-63-2; thermolysin, 9073-78-3; tyrosine, 16870-43-2, 55520-40-6, 60-18-4",,,,"Quist, E.E., Phillips, R.D., Saalia, F.K., Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory activity of proteolytic digests of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) flour (2009) LWT - Food Sci Technol, 42, pp. 694-699; Bougatef, A., Nedjar-Arroume, N., Ravallec-Ple, R., Leroy, Y., Guillochon, D., Barkia, A., Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities of sardinelle (Sardinella aurita) by-products protein hydrolysates obtained by treatment with microbial and visceral fish serine proteases (2008) Food Chem, 111, pp. 350-356; Fang, H., Luo, M., Sheng, Y., Li, Z., Wu, Y., Liu, C., The antihypertensive effect of peptides: a novel alternative to drugs?

The background of writing this essay is because Indonesia will be affected by the Industrial Revolution 4.0 which will cause jobs to disappear, emerge and change. This research is directed to solve the solutions that occur in millennial accountants in making strategies to deal with these changes by paying attention to conditions in the 4.0 era where technology has developed rapidly and is living side by side with humans. Technology that has developed rapidly is certainly not an obstacle for millennial generation accountants to get a job. One technology that is booming is Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI Began to become a part of work activities at the start of the Industrial Revolution 4.0. With this advanced technology, all things can be handled well and is a helper for today's companies in processing large amounts of data. Therefore, many people assume that the role of accountants will be replaced by machines. But if you look further, it is the lack of skills and information regarding the operation of the technology that causes new accountants such as millennial generation to feel threatened by the presence of technology. By learning more about the accounting profession in the future, accountants can collaborate with machines to advance life as a unit of valuable assets. All of this was done so that they could remain competitive and not be left behind in the rapid development of technology. ©BEIESP.","Accountant; Artificial intelligence; Industry revolution 4.0; Millennial; Professional",,,,,,"Sommer, L., Industrial revolution-Industry 4.0: Are German manufacturing SMEs the first victims of this revolution?

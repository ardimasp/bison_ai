The incident management process in PT. Astra Otoparts Tbk. (AOP) has a number of problems to be resolved, including the ticket reporting record system that is still considered conventional. The purpose of this study is to analyze the cause and effect of the identified problems in the implementation of electronic ticketing system to result in a more flexible ticket reporting process. By using Continual Service Improvement methods, this study utilized Process Maturity Framework to assess the maturity level of the running process. To get a more measurable result, this study also used Quality Control tools such as the Pareto Chart and Fishbone Diagram. The indications and gap found in this study will be resourced for further research to improve the system. The result of this study is a more effective ticket recording system. The study sees a 28.22 increase in the average number of tickets per month in the area of Cibitung and Cikarang. A recommendation process in the form of a new ticketing system will be submitted for the new policy. © 2017 IEEE.","Continual service improvement; Incident management; ITIL v3; Process maturity framework.; Ticketing","Computer science; Computers; Incident Management; ITIL V3; Process maturity; Service improvement; Ticketing; Ticket issuing machines",,,,,"AlShamy, M.M., Elfakharany, E., ElAziem, M.A., Information technology service management (itsm) implementation methodology based on information Technology Infrastructure Library Ver.3 (ITIL V3 (2012) International Journal of Business Research and Management, 3 (3), pp. 113-132; AlShathry, O., Maturity status of itil incident management process among saudi arabian organizations (2016) International Journal of Applied Science and Technology, 6 (1), pp. 41-46. , Februari; Becker, J., Knackstedt, R., Pöppelbuß, J., Developing maturity models for it management-A procedure model and its application (2009) Business & Information Systems Engineering, 3, pp. 213-222; Blokkum, D., Turbitt, K., Prins, F.C.M.W., (2012) Focus On: ITIL® Continual Service Improvement.

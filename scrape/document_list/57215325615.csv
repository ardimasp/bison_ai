The need for performance improvements that can directly improve the quality of inpatient health services is a major problem. The role of doctors and nurses' knowledge becomes a benchmark in determining the performance and quality of services, in this case the Knowledge Management System (KMS) can be a solution in supporting the knowledge management process. However, the growth of innovation in knowledge management is also needed in practice. So Big Data as a large data processing technology and various types of data will be a supporter in the process of increasing and accelerating the growth of knowledge of doctors and nurses at the XYZ ISLAMIC HOSPITAL by providing relevant information as needed. Then it is necessary to design a KMS that uses Big data as one of the enablers in the process of creating knowledge for doctors and nurses and then can be stored and shared. This design is done by using the Knowledge Management System Agile Implementation Methodology (KMSAIM) which prioritizes the initiation process in each problem domain so that each component has the right and relevant solutions. The KMS design results are in the form of site-based applications that have file sharing features, discussion forums for sharing medical experiences and there are search features needed by doctors and nurses for inpatient services at XYZ ISLAMIC HOSPITAL. © 2019 IEEE","Big Data; Inpatient Medical Service; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Management System","Benchmarking; Big data; Data handling; Hospital data processing; Hospitals; Knowledge based systems; Nursing; Discussion forum; Health services; Implementation methodology; Initiation process; Inpatient services; Knowledge management process; Knowledge management system; Medical services; Knowledge management",,,,,"Andreas, B., (2016) Knowledge Management: Efektif Berinovasi Meraih Sukses, , Jakarta, Indonesia: Prasetiya Mulya Publishing; Khasawneh, R., Abu-Shanab, E., Using KMS as a tool to improve decision making process (2013) Knowledge-Based Processes in Software Development, pp. 1-11. , January 2016; Rahimli, A., Knowledge management and competitive advantage (2012) Information and Knowledge Management, pp. 37-43; Nonaka, I., Toyama, R., The knowledge-creating theory revisited: Knowledge creation as a synthesizing process (2003) Knowl.

Since the beginning of 2017, Bulukumba Regency has implemented the concept of a smart city but is constrained by several factors, one of which is the local government has difficulty in integrating the program of city development initiatives that have been built or planned. This is because the integration process involves various parties (the community and the private sector) as the owners of resources who have different views and objectives so that the new integration process can be carried out at the service level managed by the government even though it does not cover all fields. Garuda smart city model is a smart city model that will be implemented in Bulukumba Regency, by utilizing important data technology is expected to provide the solution to the implementation of the smart city in Bulukumba. © 2018 IEEE.","Big Data; Garuda Smart City Model; Smart City","Big data; Pattern recognition; Urban growth; Data framework; Data technologies; Integration process; Local government; Private sectors; Service levels; Smart city",,,,,"(2018) Jumlah Penduduk Indonesia Akan Mencapai Puncaknya Pada 2062, , databoks.katadata.co.id; Supangkat, S.H., Arman, A.A., (2018) The Implementation of Garuda Smart City Framework for Smart City Readiness Mapping in Indonesia, (4), pp. 169-176; Perencanaan, B., Nasional, P., (2015) Pengembangan Kota Cerdas di Indonesia; Supangkat, S.H., (2018) Smart Province; Informasi, T., Oleh, D., Elektro, M., Layanan, O., Informasi, T., (2017) Model DAN Standar, , no. 23217149; Hadi, H.J., Shnain, A.H., Hadishaheed, S., Ahmad, A.H., (2014) Big Data and Five V ' S Characteristics, pp. 29-36. , no.

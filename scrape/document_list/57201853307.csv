Through the developments, there are certainly many factors that must be carefully considered in all aspects to get the ""goal"" as desired. So, when an e-commerce website has made changes whether we can conclude that the results worked so far or not. It can start by taking the existing factors that become the determinant of one of the successes in the e-commerce website. The study aims to evaluate factors become the success of an e-commerce (jualandbeli.com). Using the McLean and Delone success model approach that has 5 factors, namely: system quality, information quality, use, user satisfaction and net benefit. The result shows system quality, user satisfaction, and net benefits influence to use factor. net benefit influence to use. Quality of information influence to user satisfaction factor.While user satisfaction influence on net benefit factor. Thus, be expected, the model can be used as reference in related evaluating an e-commerce website. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,"Savrul, M., Incekara, A., Sener, S., The potential of e-commerce for SMEs in a globalizing business environment (2014) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 150, pp. 35-45; Sfenrianto, S., Saragih, M.H., Nugraha, B., E-commerce recommender for usage bandwidth hotel.

Surface deformation is detected over Sinabung Volcano and surrounded area since the first eruption in 2010 after 400 years long rest. We present multi temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series method of ALOS-2 L-band SAR data acquired from December 2014 to July 2017 to reveal surface deformation with high spatial resolution. The method includes focusing the SAR data, generating interferogram and phase unwrapping using SNAPHU tools. The result reveal significant deformation over Sinabung Volcano areas at rates up to 10 cm during observation period and the highest deformation occurs in western part which is trajectory of lava. We concluded the observed deformation primarily caused by volcanic activity respectively after long period of rest. In addition, Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis produces disaster affected areas of Sinabung eruption. GIS is reliable technique to estimate the impact of the hazard scenario to the exposure data and develop scenarios of disaster impacts to inform their contingency and emergency plan. The GIS results include the estimated affected area divided into 3 zones based on pyroclastic lava flow and pyroclastic fall (incandescent rock and ash). The highest impact is occurred in zone II due to many settlements are scattered in this zone. This information will be support stakeholders to take emergency preparation for disaster reduction. The continuation of this high rate of decline tends to endanger the population in next periods. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Deformation; Disasters; Geographic information systems; Integrated circuits; Interferometry; Population statistics; Stars; Volcanoes; Disaster reduction; High spatial resolution; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Observation Period; Phase unwrapping; Surface deformation; Time series method; Volcanic activities; Synthetic aperture radar",,,,,"We thank to Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) for financial study support.

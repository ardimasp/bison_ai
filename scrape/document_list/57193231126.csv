Monitoring and improving inter-market transit time for cargo and choosing which port of entry is then essential for products and company. This research is based on a case study in a fast moving consumer good company operating its two facilities in West Java, Indonesia. Currently, it uses Tanjung Priok as port of entry, but with continuous volume increase and congestion in Tanjung Priok, the company is evaluating Cikarang dry port (CDP) as alternative port of entry. The study concludes that cost saving is possible when using CDP for its cargo from Malaysia (MY). It also suggests monitoring the time component of in-transit time using statistical process control X-chart to cater prevalent variability and be flexible for future possibility.

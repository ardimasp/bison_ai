The readiness assessment towards INDI 4.0 should be different for each industry. Specific industry value chains need to be examined and their readiness needs to be assessed prior to digitalization project. Mobility is the nature of the Upstream Oil and Gas industry due to remote and vast work areas. Thus, an adoption of digitalization without considering mobility aspects will be less effective. Efficiency expectations from using cloud infrastructure will also be difficult to achieve. Through RAMI 4.0 approach, it is expected that a reference can be obtained grouping value chains in clear hierarchical dimension so that readiness towards INDI 4.0 in the Upstream Oil and Gas industry can be assessed more specifically and accurately. The assessment framework reference is extracted from several sources in order to obtain aspect dimension in the form of people, process and platform. By using these two dimensions, which are hierarchical and aspect dimension, it is expected that the results of the assessment can help making the strategy of implementing Mobile Cloud Computing in the Upstream Oil and Gas industry more specific but still provide flexibility so that the adoption stages can be realistic in accordance to strategic road map. © 2020 IEEE.","Computer integrated manufacturing; Internet of Things; Mobile ad hoc networks; RAMI 4.0; Readiness assessment framework; Upstream Oil Gas","Gases; Information management; Mobile cloud computing; Petroleum industry; Cloud infrastructures; Industry value chains; Low priorities; Oil and Gas Sector; Readiness assessment; Two-dimension; Upstream oil and gas industry; Value chains; Gas industry",,,,,,"(2019) Indonesia Industry 4. 0 Readiness Index, , Kemenperin Kemenperin, Jakarta; Eloy Álvarez, M.B.B.J.A.M.R.S., The oil and gas value chain: A focus on oil refining (2018) Boston Consulting Group in Collaboration with Orkestra, , San Sebastián; Alexander Benlian, W.K.A.S.T.J.W., The transformative value of cloud computing: A decoupling, platformization, and recombination theoretical framework (2018) Journal of Management Information Systems (JMIS), 35. , accepted 03-May-2018; Rojko, A., Industry 4. 0 concept: Background and overview (2017) International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies, 11 (5). , Special Focus Paper; Schweichhart, K., (2020) Reference Architectural Model Industrie 4. 0 (RAMI 4. 0), , https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/a2-schweichhartreference_architectural_model_industrie_4.0_rami_4.0.pdf, Accessed 12 January; (2019) AWS Cloud Adoption Readiness Assessment, , https://cloudreadiness.amazonaws.com/#/cart/assessment, I. o. i.

Speech processing has becoming more popular and inspiring expanses lately in signal processing area. It is because speech is one of the most natural form of human communication. However, in processing speech signals intrinsically show many variations even without background noise. Two different person can produce different spectrograms when saying the same sentence. Dialect or Accent is one of the most important factors that can influence the Automatic Speech Recognition or ASR performance besides gender (Unsupervised accent class). Many researches show that dialect or accent in speech can significantly affect the speech system performance. Various methods have been used to increase the accuracy of ASR with accent detection, accent identification, and accent classification. Fused i-vector and Phonotactic are the latest technique that shows a significant degree of accuracy. The purpose of this paper is to briefly survey on accent detection, accent identification, and accent classification and discuss the major improvements made in the past almost 10 years of research. © BEIESP.","Accent classification; Accent detection; Accent identification; Speech recognition",,,,,,,"Najafian, M., Safavi, S., Weber, P., Russell, M., Identification of British English regional accents using fusion of i-vector and multi-accent phonotactic system (2016) Odyssey, pp. 132-139; Hansen, J.H.L., Liu, G., Unsupervised accent classification for deep data fusion of acoustic and language information (2016) Elsevier, 78 (2015), pp. 19-33; Sastry, P.N., (2015) Accent Detection of Telugu Speech Using Prosodic and Formant Features, pp. 318-322; Yu, D., Deng, L., (2015) Automatic Speech Recognition a Deep Learning Approach, , Springer; Lacheret-Dujour, A.-C.S., Goldman, J.-P., Lacheret-Dujour, A., Simon, A.-C., Goldman, J.-P., Prominence, M.A., (2014) Prominence Perception and Accent Detection in French: From Phonetic Processing to Grammatical Analysis, (39), pp. 95-106; Kamper, H., Niesler, T., The impact of accent identification errors on speech recognition of South African English Accents of English in South Africa (2014) South African Journal of Science, 110 (1), pp. 1-6; Lazaridis, J.-P.G., Avanzi, M., Syllable-based Regional Swiss French Accent Identification using Prosodic Features (2014) Nouveaux Cahiers De Linguistique Francaise, 1 (2000), pp. 1-2; Avanzi, M., Garner, P.N., Swiss french regional accent identification (2014) In Odyssey: The Speaker and Language Recognition Workshop; Bahari, M.H., Saedi, R., Hamme, H.V., Leeuwen, D.V., Accent Recognition using i-Vector, Gaussian Meana Supervector and Gaussian posterior probability Supervector for spontaneous Telephone Speech (2013) IEEE, No. October, pp. 7344-7348; Safavi, S., Hanani, A., Russell, M., Jan, P., Carey, M.J., Contrasting the Effects of Different Frequency Bands on Speaker and Accent Identi fi cation (2012) IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 19 (12), pp. 829-832; De, M., Cox, S.J., Iterative Classification of Regional British Accents in i-Vector space (2012) Machine Learning in Speech and Language Processing (MLSLP), 2012, pp. 1-4. , September; Tan, Y.Y., Age as a factor in ethnic accent identification in Singapore (2012) Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 33 (2014), pp. 37-41; Sam, S., Xiao, X., Besacier, L., Castelli, E., Li, H., Chng, E.S., Bp, U.M.R.C., Cedex, G., (2011) Speech Modulation Features for Robust Nonnative Speech Accent Detection School of Computer Engineering, pp. 2417-2420. , Nanyang Technological University, Singapore Department of Human Language Technology, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore Temasek Lab @ NTU,,"" Interspeech; Hansen, J.H.L., Gray, S.S., Kim, W., Automatic voice onset time detection for unvoiced stops (/ p /,/ t /,/ k /) with application to accent classification (2010) Speech Communication, 52 (10), pp. 777-789; Auzou, P., Ozsancak, C., Morris, R.J., Jan, M., Eustache, F., Hannequin, D., Voice onset time in aphasia, apraxia of speech and dysarthria: A review Voice onset time in aphasia, apraxia of speech and dysarthria: A review (2009) Clinical Linguistics & Phonetics, 14, pp. 131-150; Wu, T., Duchateau, J., Martens, J.-P., Compernolle, D.V., Feature subset selection for improved native accent identification (2009) Speech Communication, 52, pp. 83-98; Zheng, Y., Sproat, R., Gu, L., Shafran, I., Zhou, H., Su, Y., Jurafsky, D., Yoon, S.-Y., Accent Detection and Speech Recognition for Shanghai-Accented Mandarin (2005) In NTERSPEECH, p. 2005. , Lisbon",,,,"Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication",,,,,22773878,,,,"English","Int.

Visual-based gesture recognition can help to overcome this communication limitation. Recently, several techniques and methods have been proposed in this area of research and showed some improvements. Despite all of the proposed methods, most of hand gesture recognition approaches that have been applied still lack of compatibility and have lots of limitations. For instance, hand segmentation meets the complication of distinguishing the hand and the face region by using skin detection. Motivated by those facts, this paper presents a review and explains progress of feature extraction in sign language recognition mostly in the last ten years. In this contribution, we focus on studying feature extraction methods. The literature used in this study is based on the previous published international papers which discussed sign language recognition. The main objectives from this review are to get the most effective and most compatible feature extraction method to be applied to sign language recognition system and to further research progress in the future. After reviewing various recognition techniques, we can conclude that the current works have successfully improve hand gesture recognition by inventing a technology which helps for tracking hands region precisely by using an active sensor. However, there is still room for improvements based on a markerless passive sensor, such as vision-based approaches. © 2018 IEEE.","feature extraction; gesture recognition; pre-processing method; sign language recognition","Extraction;

In this research, we propose sentence-level SLR using deep learning method by combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-RNN). Specifically, 3D CNN is implemented to extract features from each video frame and bidirectional-RNN is implemented to extract the unique features from the video frame's sequential behavior, which later generate a possible sentence. There are two key takeaways from this paper. The first is our proposed dataset of Indonesian Sign Language (SIBI) which is comprised of 30 sentences in SIBI. The second is our novel approach of using deep learning and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function in sentence-level SLR. The result shows that the hyperparameter used, in this case Hyperparameter 1, achieves the best result. Also, this research found that deeper network does not necessarily guarantee good results. A bigger number of dataset also affects the performance of the system. © 2018 IEEE.","CNN; CTC loss; deep learning; RNN; SIBI; sign language recognition","Bismuth compounds; Convolution; Deep learning;

This case study discusses how to convalesce IT services using the information technology infrastructure library (ITIL) framework and measure service level management (SLM) using Fuzzy ITIL (FITIL) approach. This paper aims to obtain an appropriate model for the measurement of IT service management by using fuzzy approach. Besides that, this paper aims to be able to provide an improving recommendations and IT governance based on current value (as is) and expected value (to be). The research method functioned is by measuring maturity level using best practice of ITIL v3 to condition before and after of improving process based on a questionnaire that has been performed. After obtaining the value of the maturity level for each cycle within ITIL, then the value will be created as an input for FITIL. The manufacture of FITIL is done in 4 stages, namely fuzzification, knowledge base, inference, and defuzzification. The results of the conditions before and after of the improving process have been successful in increasing the level of maturity in each ITIL cycle. The case study indicates an improvement in the increased level of maturity in SLM with FITIL approach. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The problem is many sensor node for indoor air quality should not always send data to server in normal situation. It could spend power consumption and the data would send it periodically. Although the data send periodically, the sensor must handle emergency situation like fire. The results show that with controlled transmission interval not only spend power consumption but the device also good respond in emergency situation and user could monitor air quality remotely via web application. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Motivated by the assumption underlying phonotactic LID that accounting for permissible phone sequences supports the process of distinguishing one language from another, this paper presents a novel approach based on the automatic identification of phone sequences of different lengths unique to a language, which are subsequently employed to determine which language has been spoken. The approach implements a discriminative training that involves a ranking procedure on unique phone sequences generated by a single-language phone recogniser. As a baseline system, phone recognition followed by language modelling (PRLM) is used to compare the performance of the proposed approach. Having 21 languages in the target set, the experiments show that the proposed approach achieves better accuracies. Moreover, it requires a 5.5 times shorter processing time than the baseline system. © 2013 IEEE.","phonotactic language identification; ranking","Automatic identification; Baseline systems; Discriminative training; Language identification; Language modelling; Phone recognition; ranking; Ranking procedures; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Communication systems; Speech recognition; Telephone sets",,,,,,"Zissman, M.A., Comparison of four approaches to automatic language identification of telephone speech (1996) IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing, 4, pp. 31-44; Heck, M., Stuker, S., Waibel, A., A hybrid phonotactic language identification system with an svm back-end for simultaneous lecture translation (2012) Proc.

The interface of the MySpeech system is web-based and it currently enables users to practice pronunciation by listening to speech spoken by native speakers and tuning their speech production to correct any mispronunciations detected by the system. This practice exercise is facilitated in different topics and difficulty levels. An experiment was conducted in this work that combines the MySpeech service with the WebWOZ Wizard-of-Oz platform (http://www.webwoz.com), in order to improve the human-computer interaction (HCI) of the service and the feedback that it provides to the user. The employed Wizard-of-Oz method enables a human (who acts as a wizard) to give feedback to the practising user, while the user is not aware that there is another person involved in the communication. This experiment permitted to quickly test an HCI model before its implementation on the MySpeech system. It also allowed to collect input data from the wizard that can be used to improve the proposed model. Another outcome of the experiment was the preliminary evaluation of the pronunciation learning service in terms of user satisfaction, which would be difficult to conduct before integrating the HCI part.","MySpeech system; Pronunciation training; Wizard-of-Oz","Computer assisted; Human computer interaction (HCI); Interaction model; MySpeech system; Pronunciation trainings; Speech production; User satisfaction; Wizard of Oz; Human computer interaction",,,,"Science Foundation Ireland, SFI: 07/CE/I1142

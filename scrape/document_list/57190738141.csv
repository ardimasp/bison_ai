In response to this question, exceptionalists argue that there will be no balancing behaviour against China from Southeast Asian states, while soft balancing theorists argue that the balancing behaviour has already occurred in the form of institutional balancing. This article refutes those arguments and maintains that balancing behaviour is not yet apparent in Southeast Asian balancing, yet it exists in an indirect form. In order to make this argument, this article examines the recent military build-up among Southeast Asian states as well as recent assessments of the ineffectiveness of the Southeast Asian regional security framework. The article also further analyses the conditions under which Southeast Asia's indirect balancing might turn into hard balancing. © 2016 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","Balance of power; balancing; bandwagoning; China's naval build-up; Southeast Asia",,,,,,"Waltz, K.N., Structural realism after the Cold War (2000) International Security, 25 (1), pp. 5-41; Friedberg, A.L., Ripe for Rivalry: Prospects for peace in a multipolar Asia (1993) International Security, 18 (3), pp. 5-33; Mearsheimer, J.J., The future of the American pacifier (2001) Foreign Affairs-New York, 80 (5), pp. 46-61; Mearsheimer, J., (2001) The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, , New York: W.W.

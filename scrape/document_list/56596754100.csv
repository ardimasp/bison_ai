Government has spent a lot of time, money, and sources to improve the public service but there are always challenges to improve public interest in using social media-based e-government applications. Web 2.0 and social media provide opportunities to user that is the community, stakeholders, and service providers to discuss and share opinions about features regarding people’s expectations. This study involved 349 people as end users and 10 service providers in producing e-government features based on social media according to their expectations. Society as application’s user was asked to see the current quality of social media-based e-government services based on end users. This aimed to conduct evaluations so that they could propose features for the development of social media-based e-government application. © 2019, ICIC International.

Social media application offers benefits in the form of a channel of communication between the community and the government or the group that has public interest. Through this application, the public could channel complaints about public services. Perception becomes the important key for this condition because user action is determined by their perception toward the government e-services. The result of standard measurement for customer satisfaction on government organization is used to help find the weakness of the service and correct it. The interface is made to be more user-friendly to ensure the effective service. So, it is necessary to develop the system continuously. Perceived quality is one of the important determinants of the success of social media application, therefore needs identification of the user's perception and expectations and involving becomes the key to success besides the good quality that will increase the trust and satisfaction of users. Evaluation of social media applications is needed so that it can provide recommendations to the provincial government of DKI Jakarta related to what things can be done to improve community service. © 2018 IEEE.","government; smart city; social media","Customer satisfaction; Information management; Smart city; Community services; government; Government organizations; Government services; Potential impacts; Social media; Standard measurements; User's perceptions; Social networking (online)",,,,,,"Melorose, J., Perroy, R., Cares, S., (2015) Statewide Agricultural Land Use, 1, p. 84322; Pusbindiklatren, B., (2015) Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional Republik Indonesia; Prabowo, M.A., (2016) Aplikasi Qlue Dukung Indonesia Bebas Sampah, , http://www.antaranews.com/berita/546222/aplikasi-qlue-dukungindonesia-bebas-sampah-2020; Madyatmadja, E.D., Prabowo, H., Meyliana, Participation to public e-service development : A systematic literature review (2016) Journal of Telecommunication, Electronic and Computer Engineering, Augustus, 2016; Lederer, A.L., Maupin, D.J., Sena, M.P., Zhuang, Y., The Technology Acceptance Model and the World Wide Web, pp. 269-282; Pearlson, K.E., Saunders, C.S., (2006) Managing and Using Information Systems : A Strategic Approach; Shroff, R.H., Deneen, C.C., Ng, E.M., Analysis of the technology acceptance model in examining students' behavioural intention to use e-portfolio system (2011) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, pp. 600-618; Lassnig, M., Markus, M., Usage of e-government services in european regions Second International Conference, EGOV 2003, 2003. , Prague, Czech Republic; Bagaeen, S.G., Redeveloping former military sites: Competitiveness, urban sustainability and public participation (2006) Cities, 23 (5), pp. 339-352; Bigné, E., Moliner, M.A., Sánchez, J., Perceived quality and satisfaction in multiservice organisations: The case of Spanish public services Journal of Services Marketing, 17 (4), pp. 420-442",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2018","3 September 2018 through 5 September 2018",,142373,,9781538658215,,,"English","Proc.

Various government initiatives are implemented with the purpose to build services focused on the community needs and to provide better access to government services to its citizens. Government invests the resources, power, time, idea for the provision of e-government with the belief that it will improve the service quality to citizens. The goal of e-government initiatives is how the government improves services so that public trust and satisfaction are increasing. To make effective services, interface design was made to be more user-friendly. So it is necessary to develop a sustainable system by always doing interface design evaluation.

For public sector, ITG implementation is difficult because it is complex than ITG in the private sector. It is therefore necessary to have ITG mechanisms that align public sector needs especially in creating public value. The literature in ITG implementation in the public sector still does not discuss the ITG mechanisms implementation that align with IT strategy to create public value. Using Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we find key practices in ITG mechanisms that align with IT strategy in the public sector.

This condition will create various challenges to the public service. In providing the initiative on e-government, in this case is e-government based on social media, the government has invested in resources, energy, time and minds with the belief that it will improve the service quality to citizens. The purpose of this initiative is for citizens to use social media that allows them to access information about the condition of their city. This social media application offers the benefits of a communication channel between the community and the government or parties which has a public interest. Through this application, people can complain about various public services. Therefore, this research aimed to allow citizens to provide feedback on the development of ongoing social media-based e-government applications and to build and propose the appropriate architecture needed to develop a social media-based egovernment application. © 2018 Evaristus Didik Madyatmadja, Edi Abdurachman, Ford Lumban Gaol, Bonifasius Wahyu Pudjianto and Manik Hapsara.","E-Government; Public service; Social media",,,,,"Binus University","This research is supported by Doctoral Study Computer Science, Bina Nusantara University.

This study aims to analyze the recycling of HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) plastic waste into cell phone cases. This study compares the strength of recycled plastic cell case with other materials that are often used for cell phone cases in general. The methodology of this paper begins with the development of new 2D and 3D cellphone cases, and for processing with injection molding. The parameters are focused on the strength of the material. The simulation is presented using Autodesk Inventor with free fall analysis, and presented stress, displacement, main stress and strain. The results show that the results of stress analysis and material comparison between HDPE and other materials do not show significant differences in other words HDPE can be used as an alternative material for cell phone case materials. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Mahyudin, R, Study of waste and environmental management problems at the final processing site (TPA) (2017) Journal of Environmental Engineering, 3, pp. 66-74; Purwaningrum, P, Efforts to reduce the incidence of plastic waste in the environment (2016) JTL, 8, pp. 141-147; Geyer, R, Jambeck, J R, Law, K L, Production, use, and fate of all plastics ever made (2017) Science Advances, 3, pp. 700-782; Putra, H P, Yebi, Y, Study of utilizing plastic waste into creative products and services (2010) Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, 2, p. 1; Abdelrasoul, G N, Nanocomposite scaffold fabrication by incorporating gold nanoparticles into biodegradable polymer matrix: synthesis, characterization, and photothermal effect (2016) Materials Science and Engineering, 56, pp. 305-310; Desita, Putri Pradani, Murtanti, Jani Rahayu, Rufia, Andisetyana Putri, Classification of characteristics of industrial impacts in industrial affected settlement areas in cemani (2017) sukoharjo regency Architectural Journal, 15, pp. 215-220; Frizky, Puja Rahmita, (2015) Reports on drainage and environmental sanitation survey reports on the process of recycling plastic waste into a product, , (Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa University); Sanguanwong, K, Nikzad, M, Sbarski, I, Masood, S H, Polymeric feedstock from post-consumer and post-industrial plastic wastes for automotive interior applications (2018) IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 455, p. 012048; Hildenbrand, J, (2019) Metal vs plastic vs glass which best material phones, , https://www.androidcentral.com/metal-vs-plastic-vs-glass-which-best-material-phones, Retrieved from accessed March 2019","Benhardy, M.T.A.; Industrial Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: taufik@binus.edu",,,"IOP Publishing Ltd","2020 International Conference on Advanced Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, ICAMIE 2020","8 July 2020 through 8 July 2020",,165915,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The problem in this association, as the job is to give detailed reports to government, investor either domestic or international, and every institutions that need information such as market needs, resource developments, and improvement of construction technologies, is to create queries for every data from tables in MySQL to create reports quickly, efficiently, and automatic. Example of reporting needs are: In what month construction project done at the most within 1 year; Project duration, project cost, and experience at the most for each construction company; or amount of projects based on source of funds (APBN, APBD, LOAN PEMERINTAH, BUMN, or SWASTA) for each construction companies. Recommended solution is using Data Warehouse where it has structured storage and can analyze data with OLAP that has capability to process and visualize data at high speed. To construct the Data Warehouse, the design used Kimball Method so this association company will have capability to generate report according to every instances' needs. © 2018 IEEE.","Data Warehouse; kimball; pentaho; Qlik Sense; report","Construction; Construction industry; Data warehouses; Digital storage; Pattern recognition; Construction companies; Construction projects; Construction services; Construction technologies; kimball; pentaho; Qlik Sense; report; Query processing",,,,,"Pauleen, D.J., Wang, W.Y., Does big data mean big knowledge?

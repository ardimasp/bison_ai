Positioning which is widely used and can work very well outdoors is to use GPS (Global Positioning System). However, GPS cannot run well indoors because of many obstacles in a building. The study was conducted with the topic ""indoor positioning system"". This research using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) technology because it consumes the least energy and can last a very long time. The focus of this research is to use a combination of trilateration and fingerprinting methods to improve accuracy performance. The first stage determines the reference point and forms a radio map. The second stage consists of estimation using the trilateration method. The log distance path loss model/Log-normal shadowing model was used for the propagation model. The evaluation of the proposed method is in a room with a size of 21m x 12 m, 100 sample data for each reference point, and 10 sample data for each test point. Error performance is evaluated using average error, min error, max error, median and 90th percentile. The results of this study if compared with results that only use the trilateration method show that the proposed hybrid method has better accuracy performance and fewer errors rate. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

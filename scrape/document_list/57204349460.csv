The company often asks the employees to do some assignments outside the office area, either inside or outside of their home country. A portable virtual private network (VPN) is a device that enables the employees to perform remote access connection to internal computer resources via internet. Therefore, the employee can still work on their assignments in company server while doing business travelling. In this paper, the secure and low power portable VPN prototype is being proposed. The prototype of the VPN portable gateway device is built using OpenVPN-R core applications that are modified from OpenVPN version 2.3.10 with OpenSSL version 1.0.2h. It is implemented into a single board computer (SBC) Raspberry Pi 3 Model B +. The modification performed in this system is the inclusion of Rabbit stream cipher algorithm to OpenSSL as one of the alternative options of TLS ciphersuites on OpenVPN. The prototype portable VPN gateway device generated from this research has Rabbit ciphersuites, platform independent, and has additional features inbuilt firewall. The simulation results show that the proposed prototype can perform secure data transfer. On the other hand the proposed Rabbit stream cipher algorithm shows better performance than other algorithm in terms of data transfer rate, CPU utilization, and memory usage which leads to smaller power consumption. © 2018 The Authors.

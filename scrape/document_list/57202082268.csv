Virtual reality (VR) and machine learning technologies, such as deep learning (DL) application, are promising diagnostic tools for ADHD in the near future because VR provides stimuli to replace real stimuli and recreate experiences with high realism. It also creates a playful virtual environment and reduces stress in children. The DL model is a subset of machine learning that can transform input and output data into diagnostic values using convolutional neural network systems. By using a sensitive and specific ADHD-VR diagnostic tool prototype for children with DL model, ADHD can be diagnosed more easily and accurately, especially in places with few mental health resources or where tele-consultation is possible. To date, several virtual reality-continuous performance test (VR-CPT) diagnostic tools have been developed for ADHD; however, they do not include a machine learning or deep learning application. A diagnostic tool development study needs a trustworthy and applicable study design and conduct to ensure the completeness and transparency of the report of the accuracy of the diagnostic tool. The proposed four-step method is a mixed-method research design that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches to reduce bias and collect essential information to ensure the trustworthiness and relevance of the study findings. Therefore, this study aimed to present a brief review of a ADHD-VR digital game diagnostic tool prototype with a DL model for children and the proposed four-step method for its development. © Copyright © 2020 Wiguna, Wigantara, Ismail, Kaligis, Minayati, Bahana and Dirgantoro.","attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; diagnostic tool; digital game; Indonesia; machine learning; neuropsychological test; virtual reality","Article; attention deficit disorder; child; child psychiatry; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; digital game; game; human; Indonesia; machine learning; neuropsychological test; qualitative research; quantitative study; statistical bias; trust; virtual reality",,,,,"The Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Division, Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia ?

In recent years there have been several studies that have used games, especially computer-based ones to improve the executive function of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) especially in working memory improvements. There are still several obstacles in using computer-based games that have been circulating today in Indonesia. The aim of this research is to develop and create a prototype game that can be used to improve working memory of children with ADHD using Bahasa Indonesia. The prototype game application is a race game with matching colors and memory work tasks; developed using Construct2. Players will play as a driver, delivering certain fruits to specific homes with different colors. The game also included visuospatial tasks such as remembering the objects. For performance test, CPU utilization, average FPS and image memory usage has been tested in several browsers. In conclusion, the performance tests results show that the first type of the prototype game is good enough to be played in desktop or laptop. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Software prototyping; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; CPU utilization; Executive function; Game for children; Image memory; Performance tests; Work task; Working memory; Computer games",,,,,,"https://newzoo.com/about, Newzoo [Internet].

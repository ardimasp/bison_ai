One of the methods which can be applied for a security system is based on biometric identification system. Fingerprint recognition is one of the biometric systems that can be applied to the security system. In this work, fingerprint recognition system to start the motorcycle engine is developed. The fingerprint of the owner and other authorized persons will be stored into the database, then while the time of starting the engine of the vehicle, the fingerprint will be validated with the database. The minutiae extraction method is applied to find the difference of fingerprint each other after turn the image into grayscale and thinning. After the extraction, the next step is finding the ridge edge and bifurcation. The result of the image will be used as input to the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to recognize authorized person only. The experiment of fingerprint recognition system shows that automatic start-stop engine using fingerprint recognition system based minutiae extraction and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has accuracy 100 % and 100 %, respectively. © 2019 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.","Biometric recognition system; Image processing; Neural network","Automobile engines; Biometrics; Extraction; Image processing; Integrated circuits; Manufacture; Neural networks; Security systems; Automated vehicles; Automotive technology; Biometric identification systems; Biometric recognition system; Fingerprint Recognition; Fingerprint recognition systems; Minutiae extraction; Motorcycle engines; Palmprint recognition",,,,,"(2017) World Economic Forum.

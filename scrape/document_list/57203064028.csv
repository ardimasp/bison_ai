Supply Chain Management (SCM) system can overcome these problems, but the existing SCM is not yet in accordance with business processes for the salt industry. This research intended to create a model of web-based supply chain management (e-SCM) for Salt Industry. The data were gathered through interviews, questionnaires, and literature review. The analysis and design of the system used the Object Oriented Analysis & Design (OOAD) method which refers to Unified Process and using Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation. The analysis method is applied while the business is being operated and is based on the needs of the industry. The result of this research was an e-SCM system model that is intended to support operational activities for salt industry. © 2017 IEEE.","model; salt industry; supply chain management system; web-based","Information management; Models; Surveys; Unified Modeling Language; Websites; Analysis method; Business Process; Literature reviews; Object-oriented analysis; Operational activity; Salt industry; Supply chain management system; Web based; Supply chain management",,,,,"Setywati, E., Integrating and strengthening of national salt industry policy through value chain management upgrading (2015) Journal of African & Asian Local Government Studies, 4 (1), pp. 54-71; Lalit, M.S.N., Kumar, A., Barriers and their relative importance to the adoption of green supply chain management in indian context (2014) International Journal of Engineering Research & Technology, 3 (1), pp. 2260-2269; Muysinaliyev, A., Aktamov, S., Supply chain management concepts: Literature review (2014) IOSR Journal of Business and Management (IOSRJBM), 15 (6), pp. 60-66; Chopra, S., Meindl, P., (2016) Supply Chain Management: Strategy, Planning, and Operation, , Pearson Education; León-Peña, J., E-business and the supply chain management (2008) Business Intelligence Journal, 1 (1), pp. 77-89; Otchere, A.F., Annan, J., Quansah, E., Assessing the challenges and implementation of supply chain integration in the cocoa industry: A factor of cocoa farmers in Ashanti region of Ghana (2013) International Journal of Business and Social Science, 4 (5), pp. 112-123; Hilman, M., (2012) Supply Chain Management Berbasis Layanan: Desain Dan Implementasi Prototipe Sistem, , Universitas Indonesia; Pefkaros, K., Using object-oriented analysis and design over traditional structured analysis and design (2008) International Journal of Business Research, 8 (2), pp. 219-227; Satzinger, J.W., Jackson, R.B., Burd, S.D., (2016) Systems Analysis and Design in A Changing World, , Cengage",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2nd International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2017","15 November 2017 through 17 November 2017",,134470,,9781538629307,,,"English","Proc.

The purpose of this research is to recognize fraudulent transactions on debit cards with development of the Enhanced Auxiliary Classifier-Generative Adversarial Network (EAC-GAN) model which is a development of Auxiliary Classifier-Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN) model. EAC-GAN uses AC-GAN, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and tuning parameter to recognize fraud transactions in debit cards and increase F1-Score. SMOTE is used to overcome imbalanced data in debit card transactions dataset. Then PCA is required to reduce dimension of the dataset and to know which factors are influential in explaining the phenomenon in the dataset while maintaining characteristics of the data. Parameter tuning is useful to achieve the best F1-Score in training and testing the EAC-GAN model. This research also explores the study of AC-GAN and Convolutional Neural Network 2 Dimension (CNN2D) performance. The result of this research describes that EAC-GAN model beats CNN2D done in the previous research. F1-Score for EAC-GAN is 74% and F1-Score generated by the CNN2D model is 35%. Conclusion from this research is that EAC-GAN model works better in fraud transaction in debit cards surpassing CNN2D model. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

More specifically, debit card transaction data from a private Indonesian bank were categorized into fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. Training and testing datasets were then analyzed. Due to its architectural similarity, this study explores the learning performance of an AC-GAN Discriminator model and compares it with the learning performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, as a baseline model. The experimental results illustrate that the training and testing accuracy of the AC-GAN discriminator model (i.e., 81.1% and 93.0%, respectively) outperformed the CNN model (i.e., 68.1% and 67.7%). Given the similar structures of AC-GAN discriminators and CNN models, it is hypothesized that AC-GAN discriminators can perform better than CNNs. This is because the effect of the adversarial training approach embedded up-sampling techniques into the model-training process. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

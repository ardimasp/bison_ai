These factors or variables are needed to build a classification model of the hypertension dataset. In the construction of classification models, class imbalance problems are often found due to oversampling. This research aims to obtain the best classification model by implementing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method to get the optimal level of accuracy. The dataset consists of 8 features and a label with two classes: hypertensive and non-hypertensive. Overall test result performance is then compared to assess between SVM combined with SMOTE and not. The results show that SMOTE can improve the accuracy of the model for unbalanced data into 98% accuracy compared to 91% accuracy without SMOTE. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

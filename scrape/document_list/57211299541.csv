The results of this study provide a timely understanding of fish consumption behavior that will help developing countries create more effective and efficient fish consumption promotion campaigns. The complexity of the problem of fish menu adoption is mapped and a strategy for campaign programs is proposed. The consumer expression “it’s complicated” conveys multiple meanings, as discovered by the ethnographic study in this paper. The various barriers that appear at each stage of the consumer’s daily journey constitute a tier-based, hierarchical set of layered barriers. Hence, trying to solve this problem with a simple and superficial marketing communication strategy will not result in a significant increase in fish consumption. Some of the fish consumption adoption barriers found during the study are not completely new and some repeat the results of previous studies. This study also presents the discovery of certain variables that have not been previously discussed. We provide a tier-based adoption barrier model of in-home fish consumption to explain why fish consumption is not growing significantly in developing countries, despite the notable budget spent on marketing communication activities. © 2019, BIOFLUX SRL.

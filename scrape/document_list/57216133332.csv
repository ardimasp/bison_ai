In the era of development, there are so many roads extensions to balance the significant additions of motorized vehicles. The increasing number of vehicles caused problems such as damaged roads and lack of maintenance to the road itself. Lack of awareness to repair the damaged roads, especially potholes, make it more dangerous for riders to drive safely. This issues are more concerning right now because the increasing number of accident and mortality. To prevent accident to happen, the pothole detection sensor can be used to on car system. The development of pothole detection sensor in this research is adopted from the proximity sensor system where in that system they use camera and digital imaging process. The advantages from our system that we research and develop are more user friendly from the feasibility and the financial aspect. Low cost sensor with the same quality of the existing system is devlop in this work. Despite the use of low cost sensor, the maintenance also on the lower cost and easier to do. As the result of this research and study, an error was obtained between the distance that detected the pothole should be in less than 4% distance range from the sensor. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Accidents; Costs; Landforms; Motor transportation; Proximity sensors; Road vehicles; Roads and streets; Detection sensors; Detection system; Distance ranges; Existing systems; Financial aspects; Low-cost sensors; Motorized vehicles; Number of vehicles; Automobile safety devices",,,,,"Wibowo, A., (2010) Analisa Kecelakaan Lalu Lintas Pada Ruas Jalan Utama di Wilayah Kabupaten Sragen Tahun 2002-2006; Saputra, D., (2017) Studi Tingkat Kecelakaan Lalu Lintas Jalan di Indonesia Berdasarkan Data KNKT (Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi) Dari Tahun 2007-2016; Lin, J., Liu, Y., Potholes Detection Based on SVM in the Pavement Distress Image (2010) 2010 Ninth International Symposium on Distributed Computing and Applications to Business, Engineering and Science, p. 544; Joseph, S., ROLE of ULTRASONIC SENSOR in AUTOMATIC POTHOLE and HUMP DETECTION SYSTEM (2017) International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, 8, pp. 260-265; Madli, R., Hebbar, S., Pattar, P., Golla, V., Automatic Detection and Notification of Potholes and Humps on Roads to Aid Drivers (2015) IEEE Sensors Journal, 4313-4318; Yousaf, M.H., Azhar, K., Murtaza, F., Hussain, F., Visual analysis of ashalt pavement for detection and localization of potholes (2018) Advance Engineering Informatics, 88, pp. 524-537; Ouma, Y.O., Hahn, M., Pothole detection on asphalt pavements from 2D-colour potholes images using fuzzy c-means clustering and morphological reconstruction (2017) Automation in Construction, 83, pp. 196-211; Tedeschi, A., Benedetto, F., A real-time automatic pavement cracj andpothole recognition system for mobile Android-base devices (2017) Advance Engineering Infromatics, 32, pp. 11-15; Kim, T., Ryu, S.K., Review and analysis of pothole detection methods (2014) J.

Efforts of relief conducted for the victims are still very conventional. Meanwhile, the development of information technology has advanced considerably and can be applied to help the victims with the creation of robots that can get inside crevices of the buildings which are damaged due to disasters. Moreover, the implementation of cloud computing technology allows interested experts to not attend the site of disaster, making this technology very useful. The applied technology is also very environmentally friendly as it will very much be able to preserve the environment which results in significantly immense benefits for the safety of the victims. © Medwell Journals, 2014.","Cloud computing; Disaster; Information technology; Robots; Victims",,,,,,"Borenstein, J., Hansen, M., Borrell, A., The OmniTread OT-4 serpentine robot-design and performance.

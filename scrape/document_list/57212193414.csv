MEC brings flexibility and agility to meet the application demands of low latency, high reliability with high scalability, bandwidth and battery savings. It explains few reasons why MEC should be adopted before 5G deployment and what would be the benefits for all the actors like operators and public cloud service providers. MEC architecture is designed by ETSI and there are some known challenges with MEC use scenarios like AR/VR, IoT and connected vehicles. MEC offerings few deployment options which available for 4G and take that deployment model as a reference for MEC deployment on 5G include the migration options. This paper provides list of recommendations for key successes deploying MEC in 4G network and 5G and help the stakeholders understand the way to realize the MEC benefits. © 2019 IEEE.","4G; 5G; Distributed Cloud; MEC; MEC Deployment; MEC use scenarios","4G mobile communication systems; Queueing networks; Deployment models; Digital transformation; Distributed clouds; High reliability; High scalabilities; MEC Deployment; MEC use scenarios; Public clouds; 5G mobile communication systems",,,,,"(2019), https://www.ericsson.com/en/mobility-report/reports/june-2019, The power of 5g is here and will continue to spread across the globe in the coming years.

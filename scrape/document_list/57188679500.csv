The process of evaluating genetic markers one by one (i.e. a marginal analysis) may not identify important polygenic and environmental effects. Further, confounding due to growing conditions/factors and genetic similarities among plant varieties may influence conclusions. When developing new plant varieties to optimize yield or thrive in future adverse conditions (e.g. flood, drought), scientists seek a complete understanding of how the factors influence desirable traits. Motivated by a study design that measures rice yield across different seasons, fields, and plant varieties in Indonesia, we develop a regression method that identifies significant genomic factors, while simultaneously controlling for field factors and genetic similarities in the plant varieties. Our approach develops a Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimator under a generalized double Pareto shrinkage prior. Through a hierarchical representation of the proposed model, a novel and computationally efficient expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is developed for variable selection and estimation. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation and is used to analyze rice yields from a pilot study conducted by the Indonesian Center for Rice Research. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Bayesian hierarchical models; EM algorithm; genomic studies; MAP estimator; rice science; shrinkage prior","drought; expectation; genetic similarity; human; Indonesia; nonhuman; pilot study; plant yield; probability; rice; scientist; season; simulation; study design; varietas; algorithm; Bayes theorem; biological model; genetics; genomics; multifactorial inheritance; Oryza; procedures; Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Genomics; Models, Genetic; Multifactorial Inheritance; Oryza",,,,"R01 AI121351

Population-specific variation in metabolic genes contributes to challenges in developing and optimizing pharmacogenetic interventions. We applied a custom genome-wide genotyping array for addiction research (Smokescreen), to three laboratory-based studies of nicotine metabolism with oral or venous administration of labeled nicotine and cotinine, to model nicotine metabolism in multiple populations. The trans-3'-hydroxycotinine/cotinine ratio, the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), was the nicotine metabolism measure analyzed. Methods: Three hundred twelve individuals of self-identified European, African, and Asian American ancestry were genotyped and included in ancestry-specific genome-wide association scans (GWAS) and a meta-GWAS analysis of the NMR. We modeled natural-log transformed NMR with covariates: principal components of genetic ancestry, age, sex, body mass index, and smoking status. Results: African and Asian American NMRs were statistically significantly (P values = 5E-5) lower than European American NMRs. Meta-GWAS analysis identified 36 genome-wide significant variants over a 43 kilobase pair region at CYP2A6 with minimum P = 2.46E-18 at rs12459249, proximal to CYP2A6. Additional minima were located in intron 4 (rs56113850, P = 6.61E-18) and in the CYP2A6-CYP2A7 intergenic region (rs34226463, P = 1.45E-12). Most (34/36) genome-wide significant variants suggested reduced CYP2A6 activity; functional mechanisms were identified and tested in knowledge-bases. Conditional analysis resulted in intergenic variants of possible interest (P values < 5E-5). Conclusions: This meta-GWAS of the NMR identifies CYP2A6 variants, replicates the topranked single nucleotide polymorphism from a recent Finnish meta-GWAS of the NMR, identifies functional mechanisms, and provides pan-continental population biomarkers for nicotine metabolism. © The Author 2016.

Tobacco dependence is associated with increased risk of disease and premature death. While tobacco control efforts and therapeutic interventions have made good progress in reducing smoking prevalence, challenges remain in optimizing their effectiveness based on patient characteristics, including genetic variation. In order to maximize collaborative efforts to advance addiction research, we have developed a genotyping array called Smokescreen. This custom array builds upon previous work in the analyses of human genetic variation, the genetics of addiction, drug metabolism, and response to therapy, with an emphasis on smoking and nicotine addiction. Results: The Smokescreen genotyping array includes 646,247 markers in 23 categories. The array design covers genomewide common variation (65.67, 82.37, and 90.72 % in African (YRI), East Asian (ASN), and European (EUR) respectively); most of the variation with a minor allele frequency ≥ 0.01 in 1014 addiction genes (85.16, 89.51, and 90.49 % for YRI, ASN, and EUR respectively); and nearly all variation from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 1, NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project and HapMap databases in the regions related to smoking behavior and nicotine metabolism: CHRNA5-CHRNA3- CHRNB4 and CYP2A6-CYP2B6. Of the 636 pilot DNA samples derived from blood or cell line biospecimens that were genotyped on the array, 622 (97.80 %) passed quality control. In passing samples, 90.08 % of markers passed quality control. The genotype reproducibility in 25 replicate pairs was 99.94 %. For 137 samples that overlapped with HapMap2 release 24, the genotype concordance was 99.76 %. In a genome-wide association analysis of the nicotine metabolite ratio in 315 individuals participating in nicotine metabolism laboratory studies, we identified genome-wide significant variants in the CYP2A6 region (min p = 9.10E-15). Conclusions: We developed a comprehensive genotyping array for addiction research and demonstrated its analytic validity and utility through pilot genotyping of HapMap and study samples. This array allows researchers to perform genome-wide, candidate gene, and pathway-based association analyses of addiction, tobacco-use, treatment response, comorbidities, and associated diseases in a standardized, high-throughput platform. © 2016 Baurley et al.","Addiction; Bioinformatics; Biomarkers; Genomewide association study; Nicotine dependence; Nicotine metabolism; Pharmacogenomics; Smoking cessation","cytochrome P450 2A6; cytochrome P450 2B6; genetic marker; nicotine; addiction research; African; analytical parameters; Article; bioinformatics; CHRNA3 gene; CHRNA5 gene; CHRNB4 gene; comorbidity; controlled study; CYP2A6 gene; CYP2B6 gene; DNA determination; drug metabolism; East Asian; ethnic difference; European; exome; gene; gene frequency; gene mapping; gene ontology; genetic database; genetic marker; genetic variation; genotype; genotyping technique; high throughput sequencing; human; medical research; minor allele frequency; nicotine metabolite ratio; quality control; reproducibility; Smokescreen genotyping array; smoking; smoking cessation; tobacco dependence; tobacco use; treatment response; validation process; Asian continental ancestry group; Black person; Caucasian; chromosomal mapping; DNA microarray; exon; genetics; genome-wide association study; genotype; metabolism; procedures; single nucleotide polymorphism; African Continental Ancestry Group; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Chromosome Mapping; European Continental Ancestry Group; Exons; Genetic Markers; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Nicotine; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Smoking; Tobacco Use Disorder",,"cytochrome P450 2B6, 330207-11-9; nicotine, 54-11-5; Genetic Markers; Nicotine",,,,"http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/media-guide/science-drug-abuse-addiction-basics, Accessed 20 Nov 2015; (2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5, , 5th ed.

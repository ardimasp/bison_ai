This development triggers the appearance of change of an old system with a newly created system. One development that is trending is microcontroller technology which can now be used in all aspects of the environment. This development will create an automatic lamp prototype that can save electricity in a room, thereby reducing the waste of electricity usage from State Electricity Company (PLN). This prototype approach uses a human movement detection sensor with a Passive Infra-Red (PIR) sensor which is then integrated with the Arduino Uno microcontroller as the control center of the sensor. In addition to the PIR sensor, there is also a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensor or also commonly called a light sensor that functions as a determinant of the light intensity needed in the room, so that the use of controlled lights is in accordance with the intensity of the room's light. In addition, there is a GSM Sim 900A which is used as a notification in the event of a use of electricity outside the sensor controller. © 2020 IEEE.","Light dependent resistor (LDR); Microcontroller; On-off lamp; Passive infra-red (PIR)","Controllers; Electric power generation; Information management; Control center; Electricity companies; Electricity usage; Human movements; Light dependent resistor; Light intensity; Microcontroller technology; Science and Technology; Microcontrollers",,,,,"Kadir, A., (2018) Dasar Pemrograman Internet Untuk Proyek Berbasis Arduino, , Yogyakarta: Penerbit Andi; Kadir, A., (2018) From Zero to A Pro Arduino, , Yogyakarta: Penerbit Andi; Isfarizky, Z., Mufti, A., Rancang bangun sistem kontrol pemakaian listrik secara multi channel berbasis arduino (studi kasus kantor lbh banda aceh) (2017) Kitektro J.

Besides it had not been aligned with the global, SEC is also demanded by competitive market. Improvement project was raised and implemented to answer above situation and condition. The project was based on Business Process Reengineering (BPR) framework that involved three components (Process, People, Tools/ Technology) plus new component as the ‘seat’ of Project Management that represents in some teams: global process team, global information management team and site team. These three components result Performance. The project was called as Improvement of Process Alignment & Information System Platform (PrISP). This BPR is a huge project that needs full commitment from all stakeholders. By having full commitment assertively, big improvement would be happened. The improvement was reflected from the result of post go-live and data collection (questionnaire and interview) that is accepted by all the stakeholders with high self-development interest for most of the employees but less interest in the performance. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS","Alignment; Global; Information System Platform; Keyword: BPR; Local",,,,,,"Bashein, B., Markus, M., Riley, P., Precondition for BPR success and how to prevent failures (1994) Information Systems Management, pp. 7-13. , Spring; Berrington, C., Oblich, R., (1995) Translating Reengineering into Bottom-Line Results Industrial Engineering, pp. 24-27. , January; Broadbent, M., Weill, P., St Clair, D., The implications for information technology infrastructure for business process redesign (1999) MIS Quarterly, 23 (2), pp. 159-182; Bruss, L., Roos, H., (1993) Operations, Readiness and Culture: Don'T Reengineer without Considering Them Inform, pp. 57-64. , April; Carr, D., Managing for effective business process redesign (1993) Cost Management, pp. 16-21. , Fall; Dinwoodie, D.L., Quinn, L., McGuire, J.B., (2014) Bridging the Strategy/Performance Gap How Leadership Strategy Drives Business Results, pp. 6-11. , North Carolina: Center for Creative Leadership; Earl, M., (1995) Information Systems Strategy: Why Planning Techniques Are Not the Answer, , Executive Reports, Centre for Research in Information Management, London Business School, London; Hammer, M., Re-engineering Work: Don't automate, obliterate (1990) Harvard Business Review, , July August; Heesen, B., (2012) Effective Strategy Execution, Management for Professionals, pp. 21-35. , Berlin: Springer; Jeston, J., Nelis, J., (2008) Business Process Management, Practical Guidelines to Successful Implementations, , Elsevier; Khaiata, M., Zualkernan, I.A., A simple instrument to measure IT-business alignment maturity (2009) Information Systems Management, 26 (2), pp. 138-152; Klein, M., Reengineering methodologies and tools: A prescription for enhancing success (1994) Information Systems Management, pp. 30-35. , Spring; Kreitner, R., Kinicki, A., (2001) Organizational Behavior, p. 28. , Boston: Irwin/ McGraw-Hill; Nogalski, B., Modele biznesu jako narzdzia reorientacji strategicznej przedsibiorstw (2009) Master of Business Administration, 2 (17), pp. 3-14; O’Neill, P., Sohal, A., Business process reengineering.

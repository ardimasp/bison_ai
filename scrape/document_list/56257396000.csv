In this case we take the area of Greater Malang, which has a lot of tourism sites, as part of this study. By this model, it is expected to help tour agencies in any tourism cities to set up the best traveling paths as part of their daily businesses. From the business perspective, this will increase efficiencies in the sense of saving time, fuel and cost of transportation, and in turn, it leads to an increase of business profitability. These efficiencies also apply on the customer side, i.e., the tourists because they also save their time and implicitly this will impact to the quality of their time spent in tourism sites. © 2020 IEEE.","Minimum traveling paths; Modeling; Prim's algorithm; Tourism sites","Efficiency; Information management; Profitability; Business perspective; Cost of transportation; Prim's algorithm; Time spent; Tourism",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

However, there are less understandings on factors influencing the uses. Looking at existing literature, the uses of social media within a government are focused on transparency, openness, collaboration, and citizen participation. Hence, this study aims at investigating factors influencing the uses. Four theories being considered intentionally follow prior researches (i.e., transparency, openness, participation, and collaboration). Particularly, this study attempts to examine factors influencing people behavior within a government in using social media to accomplish their activities in various aspects, including politics, economics, social, culture, defense, and security. Besides, the uses are observed in several governmental tasks such as dealing with complaints, reports and documentation, critics and suggestions, and information dissemination to citizens. Therefore, this study will deliver a new understanding to the government on factors influencing their uses of social media, including how they might use social media accordingly to the needs of their citizens. © 2020 IEEE.","Citizen interaction; Collaboration; Government; Information; Openness; Participation; Social media; Transparency","Behavioral research; Economics; Information dissemination; Information management; Transparency; Citizen participation; People behavior; Social media; Systematic literature review; Social networking (online)",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

On the other hand, the process of sorting out useful documents from existing documents to generate useful information poses both individual and organizational challenges. This paper presents a model on how to classify by loading documents into Oracle database and using rule-based classification for further action. The result can be classified according to the categories defined and formulated before, stored in the database and making it easier for decision makers. © 2017 IEEE.","Classification; Document; Oracle 12c; rule-based","Database systems; Decision making; Information management; Information retrieval systems; Business companies; Decision makers; Document; Oracle 12c; Oracle database; Rule based; Rule-based classification; Sorting outs; Classification (of information)",,,,,,"Bijalwan, V., Kumar, V., Kumari, P., Pascual, J., KNN based machine learning approach for text and document mining (2014) Int.

Information system facilitates management to obtain high quality information in decision making. As in ticket sales report, airline businesses already started to implement real-time sales report in the form of Ticketing Report Dashboard. This research aims to analyse and evaluate Ticketing Report Dashboard with Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which looks at the effect of five variables in two key factors i.e. perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use using a sample of 101 respondents, consists of 93 staffs and 8 supervisors. Sample Technique was Simple Random Sampling. Data collected from questionnaires and processed with SPSS version 24. The result is that all hypothesis-12 corelation hypothesis and 6 regression hypothesis-can be accepted. © 2017 IEEE.","real time; Technology Acceptance Model (TAM); Ticketing Report Dashboard","Air transportation; Data handling; Decision making; Surveys; High quality information; Perceived ease of use; Perceived usefulness; Real time; Regression hypothesis; Simple random sampling; Technology acceptance model; Ticketing Report Dashboard; Information management",,,,,,"Delen, D., Sharda, R., Turban, E., (2014) Business Intelligence: A Managerial Perspective on Analytics, , 3rd Edition; Eckerson, W.W., (2011) Performance Dashboards: Measuring, Monitoring, and Managing Your Business; Davis, D.F., (1989) Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, and User Acceptance of Information Technology, pp. 319-340. , IT Usefulness and Ease of Use; Vekantesh, V., Dan Fred, D.D., A theorical extention of the technology acceptance model: Four longitudinal field studies (2000) Management Science, 4 (42), pp. 186-204. , February; Al-Adwan, A., Al-Adwan, A., Smedley, J., Exploring students acceptance of e-learning using Technology Acceptance Model in Jordanian Universities (2013) International Journal of Education and Development Using Information and Communication Technology, pp. 1-18; (2010) SharePoint 2010 Evaluation Guide: For Technical and Business Decision Makers, , Anonim, 1st edition, Microsoft Corp, USA; Suharsimi, A., (2010) Prosedur Penelitian: Suatu Pendekatan Praktis, , edisi revisi, Jakarta: Rineka Cipta; Arlen, C., (2009) KPIs in Service, , 1st Edition, USA: Service Performance Inc; Azwar, S., (2000) Reliabiltas Dan Validitas, , Yogyakarta: Pustaka Pelajar; Dewi, R.F., Kunang, Y.N., (2013) Evaluasi Penerimaan Sistem EKTP Dengan Menggunakan TAM (Studi Kasus: Kantor Camat Ilir Timur i Palembang), SemnasIF, pp. 1-6; Fatmawati, E., Technology acceptance model (TAM) untuk menganalisis penerimaan terhadap sistem informasi perpustakaan (2015) Jurnal Iqra', 9 (1), pp. 1-13; Ghozali, I., (2009) Aplikasi Analisis Multivariate Dengan Program SPSS.

To provide high availability and survavibality of real-time information, a database replication technology that has capability to replicate databases under heterogenous platforms is required. The purpose of this research is to find the technology with such capability. In this research, the data source is stored in MSSQL database server running on Windows. The data will be replicated to MySQL running on Linux as the destination. The method applied in this research is prototyping in which the processes of development and testing can be done interactively and repeatedly. The key result of this research is that the replication technology applied, which is called Oracle GoldenGate, can successfully manage to do its task in replicating data in real-time and heterogeneous platforms. © 2014 Science Publication.","Heterogen; MySQL; Real time; Replication; SQL Server",,,,,,,"Ahmad, N., Abdalla, A.N., Sidek, R.M., Data replication using read-one-write-all monitoring synchronization transaction system in distributed environment (2010) J.

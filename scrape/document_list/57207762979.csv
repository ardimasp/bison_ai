Then analysing the cost saved from applying the value engineering in the architecture work of a high rise building. Calculation through the value engineering process was conducted. A commercial high rise building in Bali was chosen as a case study to implement the value engineering process in the design stage. The value engineering stages included calculating the cost/worth function, analysing through Function Analysis System Technique (FAST), innovation and creativity stage, evaluation of the life cycle cost, decision analysis and last the decision making. The research found that by applying value engineering through several items of work in a commercial high rise building it could save up to up to 8% of the total cost of the architecture work. The architecture work that was analysed through value engineering were the wall work, the door work, the floor work and the sanitary work. These were found to be the most effecting result from the Pareto calculation. The application of value engineering is this research was only done in one commercial high rise building in Bali. The work analysed was also only the architecture work. Therefore other types of construction project might result in different value of cost saving. This research identifies the cost saved through the application of value engineering in a commercial high rise building in Bali, which emphasizes on high quality materials in the architecture work. This research will contribute to the study literature of value engineering with a case study of commercial high rise building. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Regarding to this situation, the use of Information and Technology in various fields are greatly enhanced, and not to mention businesses.

To make a better decision making, management need some tools to monitor and evaluate the Intrapreneurs.

With those insights that can be obtained from the dashboard, hopefully, management can get enough information to make the best decision regarding the continuity status of each Intrapreneurs. This research will provide the dashboard with some algorithm to show the recommendation data about the status of Intrapreneurs. © 2019 ASTES Publishers.

The growth of PIHK has made some problems when applying for licensing and extension of PIHK permit. The objective of this research is to analyze the information system resources in the Ministry of Religious Affairs and provide recommendations to improve the licensing and extension process. The result of this research has found that the Ministry has complicated procedure and bureaucracy and it all done manually.

As a matter of fact, the use of information technology and information system for medical purpose is continuously growing. This phenomenon is widely known as telemedicine. Indonesia as the largest country in South East Asia has been facing healthcare as its key problem. The equal distribution of healthcare is difficult to achieve due to the geographical condition. Therefore, the need to implement knowledge management (KM) for telemedicine in Indonesia will help Indonesian society obtain medical knowledge simultaneously. The KM model for Telemedicine in Indonesia was derived from SECI model by Nonaka and Takeuchi. The conversion of 2(two) types of knowledge (tacit and explicit knowledge) were becoming the focus point. The research methodology used literature review and forum group discussion (FGD) with medical practitioners. Expectantly, most features created from this model, will become propose features for KM portal for telemedicine in Indonesia. © 2017 IEEE.","Knowledge Conversion; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Management Model; SECI Model; Spiral Model; Telemedicine","Health care; Information use; Knowledge management; Telemedicine; Geographical conditions; Knowledge conversion; Knowledge management model; Medical practitioner; Research methodologies; SECI model; Spiral models; Tacit and explicit knowledge; Medical information systems",,,,,"(2014) Kompas.com, , http://health.kompas.com/read/2014/03/12/0924352/Hadapi.Era.Telemedicine.Siapkah, Unoviana Kartika, Maret, [Online]; Suharto, H., (2015) Infoasia.id, , http://www.infoasia.id/berita-telemedis-diagnosa-pasien-jarakjauh.html, Desember, [Online]; Hatem, B., Nick Hajili, M., Xiaolin, L., Mauricio, F., Ivan, C., Social media for developing health services (2013) Qualitative Market Research: An International Journa, 17 (3), pp. 283-296; (2013) News.detik.com, , http://news.detik.com/berita/2360584/siasati-penanganan-cepatpasien-haji-bphi-makkah-ujicoba-telemedicine/2, DetikNews, September, [Online]; (2015) Newsroom.gehealthcare.com, , http://newsroom.gehealthcare.com/getting-puskesmas-online-the-next-frontier-forindonesian-healthcare/, Newsroom.gehealthcare.com, Agustus, [Online]; Elfita, R., (2016), http://lifestyle.bisnis.com/, Oktober, HYPERLINK http://lifestyle.bisnis.com/read/20160628/106/562026/telemedicinesolusi-untuk-peningkatan-pelayanan-kesehatan-di-daerah-terpencil"" http://lifestyle.bisnis.com/read/20160628/106/562026/telemedicinesolusi-untuk-peningkatan-pelayanan-kesehatan-di-daerah-terpencil; Laudon, K.C., Laudon, J.P., (2016) Management Information Systems: Managing the Digital Firm, , Pearson; Wickramasinghe, N., Healthcare knowledge management: Incorporating the tools, technologies, strategies, and process of knowledge management to effect superior healthcare delivery (2007) Healthcare Knowledge Management: Issues, Advances, Sucesses, pp. 21-38. , Springer; Alsanad, A., Zemirli, N., A guideline for using knowledge management in telemedicine systems dedicated for diabetes patients in Saudi Arabia (2015) New Contributions in Information Systems and Technologies: Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 1, pp. 193-201. , Springer; DelliFraine, J.L., Dansky, K.H., Rumberger, J., The use of knowledge management in telemedicine (2009) International Journal of Healthcare Management and Technology, 10 (3), pp. 209-222; Lamont, J., (2014) KMworld.com, , http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/Editorial/Features/Healthcareanatomy-of-telemedicine-systems-101144.aspx, Desember, [Online], HYPERLINK http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/Editorial/Features/Healthcare-anatomy-of-telemedicine-systems-101144.aspx; Fong, B., Fong, A.C.M., Li, C.K., (2011) Telemedicine Technologies: Information Technologies in Medicine and Telehealth, , John Wiley & Sons; Jawad, M., Abass, J., Hariri, A., Akl, E.A., Social media use for public health campaigning in a low resource setting: The case of waterpipe tobacco smoking (2015) BioMed Research International; Aitken, M., Engaging patients through social media: Is healthcare ready for empowered and digitally demanding patients?

Meanwhile, DKI Jakarta as the capital city of Indonesia has a total of 325 private higher education institutions. Green IT term is quiet well known in these areas, although its implementation is still sporadic. However, information technology (IT) gives fully support toward the learning process at the campus area. As its project scope, this research was focused in DKI Jakarta, but it is applicable for others. Many research on green IT or green computing have been conducted, however none of them focusing on Private Higher Education Institutions in Indonesia. Based on the previous research done by various Private Higher Education Institutions,IBM and Green Computing Methodology by GTYS, the Green IT Governance Model for Private Higher Education Institutions in DKI Jakarta area was developed. However, further researches are expected in order to develop the best practice. Furthermore, energy saving, waste management systems and information technology will be controlled accordingly and the threat of toxins that can harm our health can be avoided. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

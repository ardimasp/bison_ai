Transportation is a tool in the form of a vehicle that purpose is to move an item from one place to another. In the current era of globalization, there are several companies that develop their business through online transportation, in addition to the shuttle service there is also a delivery or pick up of food/goods quickly that can provide convenience for the community. This paper describes the redesign of the box that motorcyclists could use in online transportation. The design concept is designed more innovative to design models and materials used are also more practical & efficient in terms of time in use both in terms of installation and dismantling of the box, the aim is to answer the problems of online transportation at this time, which are not only in terms of efficiency but also ergonomics. The research was conducted by observing the existing problems, then brainstorming in ergonomic box design and then making 3D modelling using the inventor's stress analysis method. to achieved a new innovative and ergonomic design for helping online transportation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Nürnberg, Analysis of using cargo bikes in urban logistics on the example of stargard (2019) Transportation Research Prodia, 39, pp. 360-369. , and Mariusz; Pratama, Aditya Hadi, (2016) Kilas balik perkembangan transportasi online sepanjang tahun 2016, , https://id.techinasia.com, (accessed on December 12, 2019); Morganti, Elenora, Saskia, Seidel, Corinne, Blanquart, Laetitia, Dablanc, Barbara, Lenz, The impact of e-commerce on final deliverie alternative parcel delivery services in France and Germany (2014) Transportation Research Prodia, 4, pp. 178-190; Punakivi, Mikko, Hannu, Yrjola, Jan, Holmstrom, Solving the last mile issue reception box or delivery box (2001) International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 31, pp. 427-437; Broberg, Ole, Integrating ergonomics into the product development process (1997) International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, 19, pp. 317-327",,,,"IOP Publishing Ltd","2020 International Conference on Advanced Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, ICAMIE 2020","8 July 2020 through 8 July 2020",,165915,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

This study aims to analyze the recycling of HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) plastic waste into cell phone cases. This study compares the strength of recycled plastic cell case with other materials that are often used for cell phone cases in general. The methodology of this paper begins with the development of new 2D and 3D cellphone cases, and for processing with injection molding. The parameters are focused on the strength of the material. The simulation is presented using Autodesk Inventor with free fall analysis, and presented stress, displacement, main stress and strain. The results show that the results of stress analysis and material comparison between HDPE and other materials do not show significant differences in other words HDPE can be used as an alternative material for cell phone case materials. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Mahyudin, R, Study of waste and environmental management problems at the final processing site (TPA) (2017) Journal of Environmental Engineering, 3, pp. 66-74; Purwaningrum, P, Efforts to reduce the incidence of plastic waste in the environment (2016) JTL, 8, pp. 141-147; Geyer, R, Jambeck, J R, Law, K L, Production, use, and fate of all plastics ever made (2017) Science Advances, 3, pp. 700-782; Putra, H P, Yebi, Y, Study of utilizing plastic waste into creative products and services (2010) Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, 2, p. 1; Abdelrasoul, G N, Nanocomposite scaffold fabrication by incorporating gold nanoparticles into biodegradable polymer matrix: synthesis, characterization, and photothermal effect (2016) Materials Science and Engineering, 56, pp. 305-310; Desita, Putri Pradani, Murtanti, Jani Rahayu, Rufia, Andisetyana Putri, Classification of characteristics of industrial impacts in industrial affected settlement areas in cemani (2017) sukoharjo regency Architectural Journal, 15, pp. 215-220; Frizky, Puja Rahmita, (2015) Reports on drainage and environmental sanitation survey reports on the process of recycling plastic waste into a product, , (Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa University); Sanguanwong, K, Nikzad, M, Sbarski, I, Masood, S H, Polymeric feedstock from post-consumer and post-industrial plastic wastes for automotive interior applications (2018) IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 455, p. 012048; Hildenbrand, J, (2019) Metal vs plastic vs glass which best material phones, , https://www.androidcentral.com/metal-vs-plastic-vs-glass-which-best-material-phones, Retrieved from accessed March 2019","Benhardy, M.T.A.; Industrial Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: taufik@binus.edu",,,"IOP Publishing Ltd","2020 International Conference on Advanced Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, ICAMIE 2020","8 July 2020 through 8 July 2020",,165915,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Companies are increasingly turning to a more flexible IT environment to help them realize this goal. For this reason, the article applies cloud based Business Process Management (BPM) that enables to focus on modeling, monitoring and process management. Cloud based BPM consists of business processes, business information and IT resources, which help build real-time intelligence systems, based on business management and cloud technology. Cloud computing is a paradigm that involves procuring dynamically measurable resources over the internet as an IT resource service. Cloud based BPM service enables to address common problems faced by traditional BPM, especially in promoting flexibility, event-driven business process to exploit opportunities in the marketplace. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Administrative data processing; Enterprise resource management; Real time systems; Business information; Business management; Business Process; Business process management; Cloud technologies; Competitive business; Process management; Real-time intelligence; Information management",,,,,"Hammer, M., Reengineering work: Don't automate, obliterate (1990) Harv Bus Rev., 68, pp. 104-112; Davenport, T.H., Putting the enterprise into the enterprise system (1998) Harv Bus Rev., 76; Baeyens, T., (2013) Business Process Management, 8094, pp. 10-16. , (Springer) BPM in the cloud; Bae, H., Cho, E., Bae, J., A version management of business process models in bpms (2007) Adv Web Netw Technol Inf Manag, pp. 534-539; Noel, J., BPM and SOA: Better together (2005) White Pap IBM; Karagiannis, D., Ronaghi, F., Fill, H.-G., Business-oriented IT management: Developing e-business applications with E-BPMS (2007) Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Electronic Commerce, pp. 97-100; Karagiannis, D., BPMS: Business process management systems (1995) ACM SIGOIS Bull., 16 (1), pp. 10-13; Fang, Z., Yin, C., BPM architecture design based on cloud computing (2010) Intell Inf Manag., 2, p. 329; Duipmans, E.F., Pires, L.F., Da Silva, S.L., Towards a BPM cloud architecture with data and activity distribution (2012) Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Workshops (EDOCW), 2012 IEEE 16th International, pp. 165-171; Van, D.A.W., Business process management: A comprehensive survey (2013) ISRN Softw Eng; Van, D.A.W., Dumas, M., Ter, H.A., (2005) Process-aware Information Systems: Bridging People and Software Through Process Technology, , (Wiley-Interscience); Tilwani, H., Cloud Business Process Management & Data Security (2015) Int J Comput Sci Technol Inf Technol., 6, pp. 2089-2093; Mell, P., Grance, T., (2011) The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing; Schulte, S., Janiesch, C., Venugopal, S., Weber, I., Hoenisch, P., Elastic Business Process Management: State of the art and open challenges for BPM in the cloud (2015) Futur Gener Comput Syst., 46, pp. 36-50; Silver, B., (2009) BPMS Watch: Ten Tips for Effective Process Modeling; Megersa, B.T., Zhu, W., Cloud-Enabled Business Process Management (2012) Int J Comput Theory Eng., 4, p. 690; Demirkan, H., Delen, D., Leveraging the capabilities of service-oriented decision support systems: Putting analytics and big data in cloud (2013) Decis Support Syst., 55 (1), pp. 412-421; Zairi, M., Business process management: A boundaryless approach to modern competitiveness (1997) Bus Process Manag J., 3 (1), pp. 64-80; Hepp, M., Leymann, F., Domingue, J., Wahler, A., Fensel, D., Semantic business process management: A vision towards using semantic web services for business process management (2005) E-Business Engineering, 2005 ICEBE 2005 IEEE International Conference, pp. 535-540",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","2nd International Conference on Computing and Applied Informatics 2017, ICCAI 2017","28 November 2017 through 30 November 2017",,135467,17426588,,,,"English","J.

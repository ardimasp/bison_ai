This mixed-method study examines the influence of medication attitudes on ART utilization among HIV-infected Indonesian prisoners. Randomly-selected HIV-infected male prisoners (n = 102) completed face-to-face in-depth interviews and structured surveys assessing ART attitudes. Results show that although half of participants utilized ART, a quarter of those meeting ART eligibility guidelines did not. Participants not utilizing ART endorsed greater concerns about ART efficacy, safety, and adverse effects, and more certainty that ART should be deferred in PLH who feel healthy. In multivariate analyses, ART utilization was independently associated with more positive ART attitudes (AOR = 1.09, 95 % CI 1.03–1.16, p = 0.002) and higher internalized HIV stigma (AOR = 1.03, 95 % CI 1.00–1.07, p = 0.016). Social marketing of ART is needed to counteract negative ART attitudes that limit ART utilization among Indonesian prisoners. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Antiretroviral therapy; HIV; Indonesia; Medication attitudes; Prisons; Stigma","adult; attitude to health; female; highly active antiretroviral therapy; HIV Infections; human; Indonesia; interview; male; medication compliance; prison; prisoner; psychology; questionnaire; randomization; social stigma; utilization; young adult; Adult; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; HIV Infections; Humans; Indonesia; Interviews as Topic; Male; Medication Adherence; Prisoners; Prisons; Random Allocation; Social Stigma; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",,,,,"Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS.

This qualitative research will be conducted by doing a content analysis of the primary data as well as a literature study of related books, journals, and articles as secondary data. The findings show that the two audio-visual shows on the same event have different viewpoints and framings, mainly because of the different mediums of TV and film: the film Long Road to Heaven is better in framing the desired message while the TV show ""The Bali Bombing (Disco Bombing)"" may have more accuracy since it incorporates elements of testimony by witnesses and tries to reconstruct the events as precisely as possible, with the help of CGI technology. The film also uses more framing techniques and uses the social frameworks of framing while the TV show uses less framing techniques and uses the natural frameworks of framing. © Common Ground, Azalia Primadita Muchransyah, All Rights Reserved.","Bali Bombing; Film; Framing; Media; TV",,,,,,"AON's Interactive Risk Maps, , http://www.riskmap.aon.co.uk/Terrorism_Risk_Map.aspx, Accessed May 11, 2015; Asyhadie, N., ""Long Road to Heaven"": Who's Up for the Challenge?

Aims: This mixed method study examined the prevalence, correlates, and social context of WP-DI among HIV-infected male prisoners in Indonesia. Methods: 102 randomly selected HIV-infected male prisoners completed semi-structured voice-recorded interviews about drug use changes after arrest, drug use cues within prison, and impact of WP-DI on HIV and addiction treatment. Logistic regression identified multivariate correlates of WP-DI and thematic analysis of interview transcripts used grounded-theory. Results: Over half (56%) of participants reported previous WP-DI. Of those, 93% shared injection equipment in prison, and 78.6% estimated sharing needles with ≥10 other prisoners. Multivariate analyses independently correlated WP-DI with being incarcerated for drug offenses (AOR. = 3.29, 95%CI. = 1.30-8.31, p= 0.011) and daily drug injection before arrest (AOR. = 5.23, 95%CI. = 1.42-19.25, p= 0.013). Drug availability and proximity to drug users while incarcerated were associated with frequent drug craving and escalating drug use risk behaviors after arrest. Energetic heroin marketing and stigmatizing attitudes toward methadone contribute to WP-DI and impede addiction and HIV treatment. Conclusions: Frequent WP-DI and needle sharing among these HIV-infected Indonesian prison inmates indicate the need for structural interventions that reduce overcrowding, drug supply, and needle sharing, and improve detection and treatment of substance use disorders upon incarceration to minimize WP-DI and associated harm. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Antiretroviral therapy; Drug injection; HIV; Indonesia; Methadone; Prisons","antiretrovirus agent; diamorphine; methadone; narcotic agent; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; adult; Article; CD4 lymphocyte count; controlled study; disease transmission; drug abuse; drug dependence; epidemic; grounded theory; health care utilization; high risk behavior; highly active antiretroviral therapy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Human immunodeficiency virus prevalence; Indonesia; Indonesian; intravenous drug abuse; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; male; priority journal; prison; prisoner; stigma; substance abuse; thematic analysis; attitude; HIV Infections; Opioid-Related Disorders; prevalence; prisoner; psychology; Adult; Attitude; Heroin; HIV Infections; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Methadone; Narcotics; Needle Sharing; Opioid-Related Disorders; Prevalence; Prisoners; Prisons; Risk-Taking; Substance Abuse, Intravenous",,"diamorphine, 1502-95-0, 561-27-3; methadone, 1095-90-5, 125-56-4, 23142-53-2, 297-88-1, 76-99-3; Heroin; Methadone; Narcotics",,,"Afriandi, I., Aditama, T.Y., Mustikawati, D., Oktavia, M., Alisjahbana, B., Riono, P., HIV and injecting drug use in Indonesia: epidemiology and national response (2009) Acta Med.

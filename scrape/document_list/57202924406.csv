Objectives to be achieved is to identify healthcare knowledge resources and models of knowledge sharing, identifying culture, strategy and knowledge management supporting facilities, plotting knowledge resources and mapping supporting features of knowledge portals as well as doing analysis and design of healthcare knowledge management portal that developed.In achieving the purpose of analysis and design of healthcare knowledge management portal, is done through several stages of the methodology, where the identification process carried out primary and secondary data collection, while the analysis on the management aspects was performed cultural analysis with OCAI methods and the analysis and design of information systems with OOAD approach using UML models. PELNI Hospital is using for this case study. From analysis and design of healthcare knowledge management portal is expected to get a picture of the current organizational culture and the expected culture, the description of network infrastructure and organizational strategies related to resource and knowledge destination to produce a Knowledge Management Portal. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Knowledge capability; Logical model; Object oriented analysis and design",,,,,,"Xu, H., Musicant, O., Design and Implementation for Ontology Modeling of Design Knowledge Based on UML Class Diagram (2016) TELKOMNIKA (Telecommunication Computing Electronics and Control), Sep, 14 (3A), p. 326; Candra, S., ERP Implementation Success and Knowledge Capability (2012) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 65, pp. 141-149. , Dec; Gan, J., Xie, G., Yan, Y., Liu, W., Heterogeneous Information Knowledge Construction Based on Ontology (2016) TELKOMNIKA (Telecommunication Computing Electronics and Control), 14 (4), p. 1617. , Dec; Oktavia, T., Warnars, H.L.H.S., Adi, S., Integration Model of Knowledge Management and Social Media for Higher Education (2017) TELKOMNIKA (Telecommunication Computing Electronics and Control), 15 (1), pp. 101-108; Tempo, Akhir, S., (2012) Terjadi 182 Kasus Malpraktek, , https://m.tempo.co/read/news/2013/03/25/058469172/sampai-akhir-2012-terjadi-182-kasusmalpraktek, Tempo News, 2013.

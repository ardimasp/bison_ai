To address this issue, the government of Indonesia issuing several Policies that give legal basis for geothermal to produce electricity and expected to attract private investors to participate. The objective of the paper is to develop different scenarios to assess attractiveness of geothermal investment in Indonesia. Those scenarios are for instance state-owned modeling projects, private sectors modeling projects and external additional income in term of carbon values were imposed for both scenarios. For investment evaluation, further analysis was conducted to check sensitivity analysis with usage of NPV and IRR as parameter analysis. The comparison results could be found in Table 7 page 8 in content of the paper. The simulation results for all of the scenarios have indicated that the geothermal as a business investment in Indonesia is not very attractive. This is due to Indonesia being a developing country which already facing certain risks leading to a higher expected rate of return calculated by Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). It could be further exploited with the issue of risk regarding climate investment and the guarantee for long term investment. Besides that, it could be seen that external additional income from CERs would contribute rise from a value around 3% increase of IRR. When observed from a further optimistic expectation on CERs revenue at US$ 20, the IRR gap will increase at level 5%. From above results, some program still recommended to support the geothermal power plant development such as renewable energy pricing policy, lift-off subsidy for fossil-fuels price, taxes or carbon charges, exemption of taxes or some other relevant policies that expected conducted by government to support geothermal development. © 2012 ejge.","Geothermal; Investment; IRR; NPV; Policy","Business investment; Comparison result; Geothermal; Geothermal development; Geothermal potential; Geothermal power; Indonesia; Investment evaluation; IRR; Level 5; Long-term investment; Modeling project; NPV; Parameter analysis; Private investors; Private sectors; Rate of return; Renewable energies; Weighted average cost of capitals; Carbon; Costs; Developing countries; Earnings; Electric utilities; Facings; Geothermal power plants; Privatization; Public policy; Investments; electricity generation; energy policy; geothermal power; investment; power plant; renewable resource; resource development; Indonesia; Nucleopolyhedrovirus",,,,,"(2009) The Economic Environmental and Technological Evaluation of using Geothermal Energy, , Al-Dabbas, M.A.A European Journal of Scientific Research; Armannsson, H., (2003) CO2 emission from Geothermal Plants, p. 7. , Paper on International Geothermal Conference, Reykjavík, Iceland; (2008) Generating Dialogue Clean Energy, Good Governance and Regulation, , DGEEU Presentation of Directorate General of Electricity and Energy Utilization, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Jakarta; Hance, C.N., (2005) Factors Affecting Cost of Geothermal Power Development, , Geothermal Energy Association, Washington DC, United States; (2009) Status of Geothermal Energy Potential in December 2009, , Geological Agency Center for Geological Resources, Geological Agency, MEMR; (2001) Clean Sustainable Energy for The Benefit of the Humanity and the environment, , Geothermal Energy: Energy and Geoscience Institute University of Utah; Ross, S.A., Randolph, W., Westerfield, B.D., (2008) Jordan Corporate Finance Fundamentals 8th Ed, p. 86. , McGraw-Hill International Edition; Sukhyar, R., (2010) Geothermal Resources and Development in Indonesia, , Geological Agency, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Jakarta Indonesia","Nasution, F.A.; Bina Nusantara UniversityIndonesia; email: fuadinasution@yahoo.com",,,,,,,,10893032,,,,"English","Electron.

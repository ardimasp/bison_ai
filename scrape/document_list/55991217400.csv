In this research, we would like to propose an Intelligent Humanoid Robot with the self-learning capability for accepting and giving responses from people based on Deep Learning and Big Data knowledge base. This kind of robot can be used widely in hotels, universities, and public services. The Humanoid Robot should consider the style of questions and conclude the answer through conversation between robot and user. In our scenario, the robot will detect the user’s face and accept commands from the user to do an action. Findings: The question from the user will be processed using deep learning, and the result will be compared to the knowledge base on the system. We proposed our Deep Learning approach, based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder, Convolution Neural Network (CNN) encoder, with Bidirectional Attention Flow (BiDAF). Conclusions: Our evaluation indicates that using RNN based encoder with BiDAF gives a higher score, than CNN encoder with the BiDAF. Based on our experiment, our model get 82.43% F1 score and the RNN based encoder will give a higher EM/F1 score than using the CNN encoder. © 2020, The Author(s).","Big data; Deep learning; Humanoid Robot; NLP",,,,,"Binus University: 12/AKM/PNT/2019

The grand purpose of our research is to develop drones with implementation in smart farming in Indonesia. In the sending process, the drone must be able to detect objects and reach a goal position and go back safely using GNSS. We proposed the usage of course-over-ground information to help drone in doing autonomous navigation. In the experiment that we did, the average of positional deviation of landing position between the actual landing position and the desired landing position in the flight tests of flying from start to goal is 1.1125 meters and for the tests that use the algorithm which uses course-over-ground, the positional deviation has an average of 2.39 meters. Navigation using the course-over-ground algorithm is not more reliable than the navigation algorithm with GNSS and compass at a navigation distance of less than 1 meter. © ICIC International 2020.","Autonomous spraying drone; Drone; GNSS; Navigation systems; ROS; Sprayer pesticide",,,,,"Binus University","Acknowledgment.

Although there are several existing trackers, the limitation of using low-cost cameras, besides the relatively low processing power in embedded systems, makes most of these trackers useless. For the tracker to work under those conditions, the video frame rate must be reduced to decrease the burden on computation. However, doing this will make the vehicle seem to move faster on the observer's side. This phenomenon is called the fast motion challenge. This paper proposes a tracker called dynamic swarm particle (DSP), which solves the challenge. The term particle refers to the particle filter, while the term swarm refers to particle swarm optimization (PSO). The fundamental concept of our method is to exploit the continuity of vehicle dynamic motions by creating dynamic models based on PSO. Based on the experiments, DSP achieves a precision of 0.896 and success rate of 0.755. These results are better than those obtained by several other benchmark trackers. © 2019 ETRI","dynamic model; fast motion; particle filter; particle swarm optimization; vehicle tracking","Cameras; Dynamic models; Embedded systems; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Motion analysis; Tracking (position); Vehicles; Fast motions; Fundamental concepts; Intelligent transportation systems; Particle filter; Processing power; Supporting technology; Swarm particles; Vehicle dynamics; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",,,,,,,"Martinez, F.J., Emergency services in future intelligent transportation systems based on vehicular communication networks (2010) IEEE Intell.

This study uses long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) network to build the generator and evaluator model. First, a midi file is converted into a midi matrix in midi encoding process. Then, each midi is trained on a single layer and double stacked layer model of each network as a generator model. Next, classification model, based on LSTM and GRU, are trained and chosen as an objective evaluator to analyze the performance of each generator model which classify each midi based on its musical era. Subjective evaluation is conducted by an interview with volunteer respondents with various backgrounds such as classical music interest, performance, composer, and digital composer. The result shows that the double stacked layer GRU model perform better to resemble the composer pattern in music with 70% score of recall. Moreover, subjective evaluation shows that the generated music is listenable and interesting with the highest score of 6.85 out of 10 on double stacked layer GRU. © 2020 The Authors.

However, commonly this extraction task is still done by human experts manually, so the process is very expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, semantic segmentation is the process of classifying each pixel of an image as a class label to understand the image at a pixel level. This paper proposed an algorithm of semantic segmentation based on deep learning, namely Segmentation Networks (SatNet), for automatically segmenting buildings and roads. Our SatNet model is based on Residual Networks (ResNet) for image feature extraction. Finally, we compared the proposed algorithm to the state-of-the-art and our segmentation results have improved significantly.

The methods are divided into two categories: single-image approach and learning-based approach. The survey begins with discussing single image approach. This approach is represented by visibility metric based on contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and similarity index between hazy image and its dehazing image. This is followed by a survey of learning-based approach using two contrast approaches that is: 1) based on theoretical foundation of transmission light, combining with the depth image using new deep learning method; 2) based on black-box method by employing convolutional neural networks (CNN) on hazy images.

In sending process, drone must be able to detect object and reach goal position and go back safely using GPS. We proposed a navigation algorithm for drone including the usage of course-over-ground information to help drone in doing autonomous navigation. In the experiment that we did, the average of positional deviation of landing position between the actual landing position and the desired landing position in the flight tests of flying from start to goal is 1.1125 m and for the tests that use the algorithm which uses course-over-ground, the positional deviation has average of 2.39 m. Navigation using course-over-Ground algorithm is not more reliable than the navigation algorithm with GNSS and Compass at a navigation distance of less than 1 m. © 2019, The Author(s).","Big data; Drone; GNSS; Navigation systems",,,,,,,,"Jha, A.R., (2016) Theory, design, and applications of unmanned aerial vehicles, , CRC Press, New York; Hickey, M., (2013) Meet Amazon Prime Air, a Delivery-By-Aerial-Drone Project; Apvrille, L., Tanzi, T., Dugelay, J.L., Autonomous drones for assisting rescue services within the context of natural disasters (2014) General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS), 2014 Xxxith URSI, pp. 1-4; Entrop, A.G., Vasenev, A., Infrared drones in the construction industry: designing a protocol for building thermography procedures (2017) Energy Procedia, 132, pp. 63-68; Casella, E., Mapping coral reefs using consumer-grade drones and structure from motion photogrammetry techniques (2017) Coral Reefs, 36 (1), pp. 269-275; Motlagh, N.H., Bagaa, M., Taleb, T., UAV-based IoT platform: a crowd surveillance use case (2017) IEEE Commun Mag, 55 (2), pp. 128-134; Mekki, K., Bajic, E., Chaxel, F., Meyer, F., A comparative study of LPWAN technologies for large-scale IoT deployment (2018) ICT Express; Claesson, A., Time to delivery of an automated external defibrillator using a drone for simulated out-of-hospital cardiac arrests vs emergency medical services (2017) JAMA, 317 (22), pp. 2332-2334; Scott, J., Scott, C., Drone delivery models for healthcare (2017) Proc. 50Th Hawaii Int.

This kind of robot can be used widely in schools, universities and public services. The humanoid robot should consider the style of questions and conclude the answer through conversation under unreliable automatic speech in noisy environment. In our scenario, robot will detect user's face and accept commands from the user to do an action, where the answer from user will be processed to the Google Translator and the result will be compared with vocabularies defined on the system.

According to World Bank data, Indonesia is the country with the largest economic development in Southeast Asia. Unfortunately, the threat of terrorism in Indonesia is very large, therefore it requires a smart system such as military robots. Today's vision-based robot technology has also been used in the development of autonomous military robots. A sophisticated military robot is a robot that is needed by the military/police because it can be deployed to the battlefield or the eradication of terrorism in a remote or autonomous manner. This system is needed to reduce the remaining casualties from the army, and this combat robot system can also be operated at any time with more numbers than regular soldiers and with minimal operator needs. In this paper, we propose a prototype of a tank-based military robot with object detection and tracking and turrets for simulation of shooting the enemy target based on the computer vision. The object tracker will detect an upper body of the target using a library in OpenCV and the tank will track until it reaches the best position to shoot the target. The methods explained, and experimental results were presented. © 2019 IEEE.","computer vision; military robot; object detction; object tracker; turret","Economics; Intelligent robots; Object detection; Tanks (containers); Target tracking; Terrorism; Economic development; Military robots; Object detction; Object detection and tracking; object tracker; Robot technology; Southeast Asia; turret; Computer vision",,,,"Binus University

One approach to reduce congestion levels is to improve traffic management that regulates and controls the number of vehicles. To evaluate the impact of traffic management before direct implementation on the highway, traffic modeling can be carried out. Parameters in modeling traffic must be determined from a calibration process where the vehicle is accurately measured for its position and speed. This study aims to propose an efficient calibration procedure with accurate results, based on recorded vehicle movement in perspective view. First, the road image is projected using the Direct Linear Transformation (DLT) method, then the vehicle position is detected using the Background Subtraction and tracked using Mixture of Gaussian (MoG) to determine the vehicle speed. Finally, we develop a prototype of Automated Traffic Flow Monitoring based on Python programming. In the experiment results, the accuracy of vehicle position detection is evaluated based on the Euclidean distance.

Sorting out all this digital music is a very time-consuming and causes information fatigue. Therefore, it is very useful to develop a music recommender system that can search in the music libraries automatically and suggest suitable songs to users. By using music recommender system, the music provider can predict and then offer the appropriate songs to their users based on the characteristics of the music that has been heard previously. Our research would like to develop a music recommender system that can give recommendations based on similarity of features on audio signal. This study uses convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) for feature extraction and similarity distance to look similarity between features. The results of this study indicate that users prefer recommendations that consider music genres compared to recommendations based solely on similarity. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Traditionally, it is used by customers inside the store to transport goods to the cashier during shopping and designed not to leave the store. It is an inconvenience and time wasted for customers who want to find the desired product in the store by using the traditional shopping trolley. Our goal is to develop an automatic moving trolley with smart shopping devices to solve the problem. Our smart shopping trolley is based on a two-wheeled mobile robot, developed in our previous research. This paper presents the hardware and software design of a smart trolley system. Our smart trolley used IOIO microcontroller and Android smartphone as sensors and controller. The trolley is modeled as a two-wheeled mobile robot. Android smartphone will control the robot by sending a signal to IOIO microcontroller paired with a robot's actuator and monitor the situation using the smartphone camera. Furthermore, we exploited the smartphone compass for robot navigation. This system is also equipped with the indoor positioning system to detect user position using Navisens which based on gyroscope and accelerometer in the smartphone. Finally, the results of the testing on robot navigation are presented. The result is our smart trolley system based on Navisens framework can move and show its location to the user. © 2019 The Authors.

For this time, deficiency surveillance is carried on manually which needs more effort especially for large area. With rapid growth of technology, it is possible to build a system via smartphone to detect the nutrient deficiency of plants. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional neural network to diagnose condition based on image of plants. Inception-Resnet architecture with transfer learning and fine tuning from model that is previously trained using ImageNet dataset is applied in the experi- ments. We trained the model further with image of okra plants. The dataset consists of 184 images for the training process and 47 images for testing. Image augmentation method is also used to increase the variation of the dataset. The experimental results show that fine tuning approach achieves the best accuracy, namely 96% and 86% for training and testing respectively.

In this paper, we described the design of low-cost and robust wheelchair and then presented the evaluation of the system. Voice recognition module can control the wheelchair to move forward, left, right and stop, and in addition, there is the reverse mode in the joystick module. Next, the speaker dependent module is applied to wheelchair control systems by training the voice recognition module. The controller system is based on Arduino and combined with high current driver motor with gearbox and two batteries for power systems.

The grand purpose of our research is to deliver important medical aids for patients in emergency situations. The case can be simplified into delivery of an item from start to the goal position. We will exploit the drone technology for transporting items efficiently. In sending process, our drone must detect the object target, where the items will be delivered. Therefore, we need object detection module that can detect what is in video stream and where the object is by using GPS as well. To implement the module, we use combination of MobileNet and the Single Shot Detector (SSD) framework for fast and efficient deep learning-based method to object detection. The ability of deep learning to detect and localize specific objects is studied by conducting experiments using drone camera and, as comparison, using stereo camera Minoru. © 2018 IEEE.","deep learning; delivery problem; drone; MobileNet; object detection; SSD","Aircraft detection; Cameras; Drones; Object detection; Object recognition; Stereo image processing; Target drones; Delivery problems; Emergency situation; Learning-based methods; MobileNet; Quadcopter; Single shots; Stereo cameras; Deep learning",,,,,,,"Bengio, Y., Courville, A., Vincent, P., Representation learning: A review and new perspectives (2013) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 35 (8), pp. 1798-1828; Budiharto, W., Robust vision-based detection and grasping object for manipulator using sift keypoint detector (2014) International Conference on Advanced Mechatronic Systems (ICAMechS 2014), pp. 448-452. , Japan; Yeremia, H., Yuwono, N.A., Raymond, P., Budiharto, W., Genetic algorithm and neural network for optical character recognition (2013) Journal of Computer Science, pp. 1435-1442; Deep Learning, , https://towardsdatascience.com/deeplearning-2-f81ebe632d5c; Parrot AR Drone, , https://www.parrot.com/global/drones; Bengio, Y., Learning deep architectures for ai (pdf) (2009) Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning, 2 (1), pp. 1-127; Zhou, B., Lapedriza, A., Xiao, J., Torralba, A., Oliva, A., Learning deep features for scene recognition using places database (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 487-495; Socher, R., Huval, B., Bath, B., Manning, C.D., Ng, A.Y., Convolutional-recursive deep learning for 3d object classification (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 656-664; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1097-1105; Qi, C.R., Su, H., Mo, K., Guibas, L.J., Pointnet: Deep learning on point sets for 3d classification and segmentation (2017) Proc.

The low-cost EEG can record EEG data, but it performs significantly worse than the medical device. The purpose of our research is to understand the way of images are perceived by people based on their brain waves. Based on the EEG, we investigate two paradigms in mind-brain research that is: the valence-arousal plane and the universal symbol. The experiments are done using two paradigms to generate EEG data based on visual stimuli and convert it into spectrogram. For brainwave response classification based on EEG spectrogram, we use the recent deep learning architecture that is DenseNet. Furthermore, we compare the training performance between two brain-mind paradigms. The experiment results show that: (i) the EEG signal classification of visual stimuli based on valence-arousal model framework is not reliable, (ii) the universal symbol paradigm gives a promising result in generating visual stimuli for brainwave response classification based on low-cost EEG data. © 2018 The Authors.

The objective of this paper is to elaborate how natural language processing (NLP) and pattern matching approach works in question answering system for solving arithmetic word problems. Upon receiving a Indonesian arithmetic word problem, the robot will translate Indonesian speech to English text, resolve conjunction problem, co-references problem, question preprocessing, question analysis, represent the knowledge, and lastly the robot will answer the solution. We employed NLP for English by using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in our research. Based on the experiment results, it can be concluded that: (i) the accuracy of the question answering system for each scheme ranges from 80% to 100% depend on the difficulty to comprehend the word problem, (ii) the response time is rather slow with average processing time is about 1.12 minutes. © 2018 The Authors.

To use the color indicator precisely, we tested several color sensors to performance in detecting color and chose TCS34725 as the color sensor. The prototype of urine hydration system (UHS) is designed to record hydration status data in daily basis in cloud computing and the urine information can be accessed by Android smartphone. The prototype employs a set of microcontrollers and sensors as IoT devices and support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier. To evaluate the accuracy of hydration status, we compared the prediction with urine specific gravity (USG) as golden standard. The accuracy of our UHS prototype can reach up to 84%, which is nearly similar with the accuracy of manual prediction using only human eyes. © 2018 The Authors.

Various face recognition algorithms are proven to be effective if done under a controlled environment. However, recognition performance will decrease significantly in the uncontrolled environment, for example caused by illumination variation. This paper discusses the approach to deal with varying illumination on face recognition with Multi-Scale Retinex method. To verify accuracy of this algorithm, it is used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Eulidean distance as algorithms to identify faces. In the experiments, Multi-Scale Retinex is also compared to other normalization methods, such as gamma correction, histogram equalization, Retinex, and Single-Scale Retinex. Based on several face recognition dataset, that is Extended Yale B, Faces95, and Grimace, it can be concluded that the Multi-Scale Retinex method with one scale (Single-Scale Retinex) can properly normalize the illumination on the face image in term of speed and performance. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Information systems; Principal component analysis; Controlled environment; Face images; Face recognition algorithms; Gamma correction; Histogram equalizations; Illumination variation; Multi-scale Retinex; Normalization methods; Face recognition",,,,,,,"Zhou, S.K., Chellappa, R., Zhao, W., (2005) Unconstrained Face Recognition, , New York: Springer; ElSayed, A.S.E.M., (2009) A New Illumination Normalization Approach for Face Recognition; Short, J., Kittler, J., Messer, K., (2004) A Comparison of Photometric Normalisation Algorithm for Face Verification; Land, E.H., McCann, J.J., Lightness and retinex theory (1971) Journal of the Optical Society of America, pp. 1-11; Provenzi, E., Carli, L.D., Rizzi, A., Mathematical definition and analysis of the retinex algorithm (2005) J.

One of the popular algorithms in recommender systems is collaborative filtering. The fundamental assumption behind this algorithm is that other users' opinions can be filtered and accumulated in such a way as to provide a plausible prediction of the target user's preference. In this paper, we would like to develop a recommender system with big data of one e-commerce company and deliver the recommendations through a personalized email. To address this problem, we propose user-based collaboration filter based on company dataset and employ several similarity functions: Euclidean distance, Cosine, Pearson correlation and Tanimoto coefficient. The experimental results show that: (i) user responses are positive to the given recommendations based on user perception survey (ii) Tanimoto coefficient with 10 neighbors shows the best performance in the RMSE, precision and recall evaluation based on groundtruth dataset. © 2016 IEEE.","big data; personalized email; recommender systems; similarity functions; user-based collaborative filtering","Collaborative filtering; Commerce; Correlation methods; Electronic commerce; Electronic mail; Recommender systems; Security of data; Euclidean distance; Ground-truth dataset; Pearson correlation; Precision and recall; Similarity functions; Tanimoto coefficient; User perceptions; User's preferences; Big data",,,,,,,"Stiglitz, K., (2016) 70 Email Marketing Stats Every Marketer Should Know, , https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/emailmarketing/2016/01/70-email-marketing-stats-you-need-to-know/, Accessed July 2016; Hamirani, R., (2016) 5 Stats That Prove Businesses Must Personalize to Win Customers, , http://www.gigya.com/blog/5-stats-that-prove-businesses-must-personalize-to-win-customers/, Accessed 2016; Ekstrand, M.D., Riedl, J.T., Konstan, J.A., Collaborative filtering recommender systems (2010) Foundations and Trends in Human-Computer Interaction, 4 (2), pp. 81-173; Rajaraman, A., Leskovec, J., Ullman, J.D., (2012) Mining of Massive Datasets, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Arsan, T., Köksal, E., Bozkuş, Z., Comparison of collaborative filtering algorithms with various similarity measures for movie recommendation (2016) International Journal of Computer Science, Engineering and Applications (IJCSEA), 6 (3), pp. 1-20; Jannach, D., Zanker, M.F.A., Friedrich, G., (2011) Recommender Systems: An Introduction, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Owen, S., Anil, R., Dunning, T., Friedman, E., (2012) Mahout in Action, , New York: Manning Publications; Kumar, A., Gupta, S., Singh, S.K., Shukla, K.K., Comparison of various metrics used in collaborative filtering for recommendation system (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 Eighth International Conference on Contemporary Computing (IC3), , Noida, India",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 International Workshop on Big Data and Information Security, IWBIS 2016","18 October 2016 through 19 October 2016",,126774,,9781509034772,,,"English","Int.

From a Bayesian perspective, this is done by estimating the posterior density function. On the other hand, evolutionary optimization perspective would like to generate and select sufficiently optimize solution using two major components: diversification and intensification. This research will develop visual tracking algorithm using a Bayesian approach with evolutionary optimization in order to perform accurate tracking. The main idea is to combine Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (Particle-MCMC) as representation of Bayesian approach, with evolutionary optimization that is Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in each video frame. The visual tracking is regulated by Particle-MCMC filter algorithm and PSO will work within this filter to get more accurate tracking. Based on the dataset groundtruth, we found the accuracy of tracking can be increased considerably comparing to our previous research. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Bayesian networks; Evolutionary algorithms; Information systems; Markov processes; Optimization; Tracking (position); Accurate tracking; Bayesian approaches; Bayesian perspective; Evolutionary optimizations; Filter algorithm; Particle markov chain monte carlo; Visual Tracking; Visual tracking algorithm; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",,,,,,,"Wu, Y., Lim, J., Yang, M., Object tracking benchmark (2015) Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions On, 37 (9), pp. 1834-1848. , Sept; Ross, D.A., Lim, J., Lin, R.-S., Yang, M.-H., Incremental learning for robust visual tracking (2008) Int.

Motility is the ability of sperm to move. Sperm with healthy motility move forward promptly, not inactive and not moving in circles. In this paper, we would like to analyse sperm motility by considering the problem of multi object tracking in video sequences of human sperms. The challenges in multi-sperm tracking are many human sperms have fast and unpredictable movement In addition, the sperm have similar size and shape comparing by each others. To solve this problem, we used sperm detection in each video sequence to get the position of sperms. In the same time, the estimated sperm position is calculated based on previous tracking by using Kalman Filter. Finally the positions of detected sperms are compared to estimation results by using Hungarian assignment method. In this way, the trajectory of each sperm can be conclude. This paper analyze sperm motility qualitatively based on the resulted sperm trajectories. The experiment results were conducted on both open video data and our own low-frame-rate video data. The experiment results shows that the proposed method can handle the challenges in multi sperm tracking, create their trajectory and then analyze their behaviors. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Bandpass filters; Information systems; Kalman filters; Trajectories; Video recording; Estimation results; Human sperm; Low frame rate video; Multi-object tracking; Size and shape; Sperm motility; Sperm tracking; Video sequences; Image coding",,,,,,,"Amann, R.P., Katz, D.F., Andrology lab comer': Reflections on casa after 25 years (2004) Journal of Andrology, 25 (3), pp. 317-325; Zhou, X., Lu, Y., Efficient mean shift particle filter for spenn cells tracking (2009) Computational Intelligence and Security, 2009.

In the research, we would like to predict the dangerous region around the river. For study case, we use the Meuse river floodplains which are contaminated with zinc (Zn). Large zinc concentrations can cause many health problems, for example vomiting, skin irritations, stomach cramps, and anaemia. However there is only few sample data about the zinc concentration of Meuse river, thus the missing data in unknown regions need to be generated. The aim of this research is to study and to apply spatial data mining to predict unobserved zinc pollutant by using ordinary point Kriging. By mean of semivariogram, the variability pattern of zinc can be captured. This captured model will be interpolated to predict the unknown regions by using Kriging method. In our experiments, we propose ordinary point Kriging and employ several semivariogram: Gaussian, Exponential and Spherical models. The experimental results show that: (i) by calculating the minimum error sum of squares, the fittest theoretical semivariogram models is exponential model (ii) the accuracy of the predictions can be confirmed visually by projecting the results to the map. © 2016 IEEE.","missing data; ordinary point Kriging; semivariogram; spatial data mining; zinc pollutant","Big data; Data mining; Forecasting; Heavy metals; Interpolation; Pollution; Rivers; Security of data; Zinc; Exponential models; Heavy metal pollutants; Kriging; Missing data; Semivariograms; Spatial data mining; Variability patterns; Zinc concentration; River pollution",,,,,,,"Cressie, N., (2015) Statistics for Spatial Data, p. 928. , 2 ed., New Jersey: Wiley-Interscience; Montero, J.-M., Fernández-Avilés, G., Mateu, J., (2015) Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Geostatistical Modeling and Kriging, , John Wiley & Sons; Choudhury, N.H., Rahman, A., Ferdousi, S., Kriging infill of missing data and temporal analysis of rainfall in north (2015) Climatology & Weather Forecasting, 3 (3), pp. 1-5; Setiawan, A., Rosadi, R., Spasial data mining menggunakan model SAR-kriging (2011) Indonesian Journal of Computing and Cybernetics Systems, 5 (3), pp. 52-61; Middelkoop, H., Heavy-metal pollution of the river Rhine and Meuse floodplains in the Netherlands (2000) Netherlands Journal of Geosciences, 79 (4), pp. 411-428; Pebesma, E., Multivariable geostatistics in S: The gstat package (2004) Computers & Geosciences, 30 (7), pp. 683-691; Armstrong, M., (1998) Basic Linear Geostatistics, , Springer; Bivand, R., Pebesma, E., Rubio, V., (2013) Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R, , 2 ed., New York: Springer",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 International Workshop on Big Data and Information Security, IWBIS 2016","18 October 2016 through 19 October 2016",,126774,,9781509034772,,,"English","Int.

We would like to investigate the problem of short-term model-free tracking which the main purpose is to track any object just based on an annotation box of object. Many factors affect the performance of the tracking algorithm. In the Visual Tracker Benchmark, there are eleven challenges in object tracking. There has not been a single tracker that successfully handles all of these scenarios. In addition, the tracker must be fast enough to be useful in real applications. We propose a new tracking algorithm within the Bayesian framework. The proposed algorithm is constructed by solving optimally particle filters (OPF) efficiently using spectral methods. Therefore, the constructed tracker is called as Spectral Tracker (ST). Although ST can efficiently compute object position, it cannot estimate the scale and rotation directly. To overcome this weakness, it is proposed to use multiple observation points simultaneously and to use information on the observation point movement to estimate scale and rotation. In the experiments, the performance of ST tracker was compared with 9 relevant trackers based on 100 data sets. The experimental results on on tracker performance show that increasing performance especially in tracker precision and success rate. © 2017 The Authors.

BSS is a problem of separation of several speech signals in a real world from mono or stereo audio record. In this research, we implement BSP system using DUET algorithm which allow to separate any number of sources by using only stereo (two) mixtures. The DUET (Degenerate Unmixing Estimation Technique) algorithm replaces our previous FastICA (Fast Independent Component Analysis) method only success in simulation but failed in the implementation. The main problem of FastICA is that it assumes instantaneous mixing without time delay in the recording process. To deals with audio record in the presence of inevitable time delays, it has to be replaced with DUET algorithm to separate well in real time. Finally, the DUET algorithm is implemented to humanoid robot which is developed using Raspberry Pi and equipped with RaspPi Cam to detect human face. Furthermore, the Cirrus Logic Audio Card is stacked to Raspberry Pi in order to record stereo audio. In our experiments, there are three controlled variables to evaluate algorithm performance, that is: distance, number of sources, and subject's name. Robot will record stereo audio for four seconds after face is detected by system. The recording is then separated by DUET algorithm and produce two source estimations with average computation time 1.8 seconds. With Google API, the recognition accuracy of separated speech is varying between 40%-70%. © 2017 The Authors.

In swarm robot systems, each robot must cooperate with other robots in order to perform a given task. The main obstacle in swarm robot research is the cost of making robots. Building one robot with limited capabilities commonly has to spend substantial amount of money and certainly making robots for intelligent systems research need much more investment. In this paper, we would like to present the development of affordable mobile robot, but also having powerful capabilities and intelligence. The mobile robot is specifically designed and made to be used as a stand-alone or in swarm robot systems. It is essential that the mobile robot has learning ability to adapt the dynamic environments. Furthermore, for swarm robot systems, each mobile robot must be able to communicate with other robots in order to coordinate each other. In our research, we used differential drive model for mobile robot locomotion and then apply the model through Android smartphone based controller. The mobile robot was constructed by using two actuators on the right and left side, and one castor wheel which has no steering system and can move freely. The differences velocity between left and right actuators determines the direction and final position of the mobile robot. The angular velocity of two main actuators is set by Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) parameter in IOIO board microcontroller. In our experiment, we showed that the capability of our robot in performing several movement tasks. We are sure that Android based robotic platforms are ideal candidates for affordable robotics for swarm robot system research. © 2017 The Authors.

Application of sperm cell tracking is mainly important in Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI), a medical procedure that has enabled the In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) of a single sperm which is injected directly into an egg. In this paper, we consider the problem of tracking single object in video sequences of human sperms and a newly developed Smoothing Stochastic Approximate Monte Carlo (SSAMC) based tracker enhanced by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The problem for this research is that the motility or movement of Human Sperm is fast and unpredictable. In addition, each and every sperms have closely similar size and shape. To solve this problem, we used PSO for searching algorithm (finding the best target) in a Search Window, it can reduce the search space in every each consecutive frame. The measurement results of the proposed method are then compared with the manual measurements done by experts. The experiment results were conducted on both open video data and our own video data. Experiment results showed that the proposed method can handle our specific problem in human sperm cell tracking, and give us a better result as compared to our previous tracker, which used geometric transition dynamic model and without any enhancement by PSO. © 2015 IEEE.","Human Sperm Cell Tracking; PSO; Search Window; SSAMC","Problem solving; Social sciences; Stochastic systems; Video recording; Human sperm; Intracytoplasmic sperm injections; Low frame rate video; Manual measurements; Search windows; Searching algorithms; SSAMC; Stochastic sampling; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",,,,,,,"Who Laboratory Manual for the Examination of Human Semen and Spermcervical Mucus Interaction, pp. 4-12. , WorldHealthOrganization,Fourth Edition, WHO by Cambridge University; Zhou, X., Lu, Y., Efficient mean shift particle filter for sperm cells tracking (2009) Computational Intelligence and Security, 2009.

Computer-aided Sperm Analysis (CASA) systems have attempted to give more accurate information about sperm motility. For collecting a single good sperm in Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) procedures, achieving correct sperm trajectory is necessary. On the other hand, visual tracking of a sperm is a challenging issue because: (i) sperms have similar size and shape, (ii) a good sperm moves fast and has unpredictable motions. Furthermore, our sperm videos were taken by regular cameras which have low frame rate (about 20 fps), which cause the sperm-motion more abrupt. To address this problem, we propose searching driven stochastic sampling framework for visual tracking of abrupt motions. In here, searching algorithm will give promising regions of the target, and thus can replace the role of transition model in tracking system. For searching, we employ Coherency Sensitive Hashing (CSH) in a window to constrain search space in each frame, called as Search Window. And then for stochastic sampling framework, we adopt Smoothing Stochastic Approximate Monte Carlo (SSAMC) to specifically finding the target. The experimental results on human-sperm sequences show that: (i) comparing to our previous tracker which use geometric transition dynamic model, the proposed tracker can handle abrupt motions robustly, (ii) by using appropriate Search Window, the tracker can localize the sperm target and restrict observation of other similar sperms. © 2015 The Authors.

If computers could recognize these emotional inputs, the interaction between human and computers will bemore natural. Currently, video game is one of the applications that use facial expression detection to increase natural interaction. Kinect is motion sensor for game controller that can track the detected face using Active Appearance Model (AAM). AAM is the method that adjusts shape and texture model in a new face, when there is variation of shape and texture comparing to the training result. The aim of this research is to detect facial expression by observing the change of key features in AAM using Fuzzy Logic. Fuzzy Logic is used to determine the current emotions based on prior knowledge derived from Facial Action Coding System (FACS). The experimental results on user-generated dataset show that: (i) FACS does not provide any information about the degree of muscle activation, thus the degree of the key features have to infer from specific dataset, (ii) detection accuracy of emotions depend on the kind of emotion itself. © 2015 The Authors.

In Jakarta traffic, there is unique issue that does not arise in developed countries: very large number of motorcycles. Nevertheless, the enabling technologies for the detection, measurement, recording, and information distribution of motorcycle have not been fully developed in the existing researches. With the above considerations, we establish research which aimed to develop enabling technology especially in here for tracking motorcycle using camera. This paper is presented our proposed tracker which called as Geometric Deep Particle Filter (GDPF) for tracking motorcycle using camera. The tracker is inspired by human visual perception which has nonretinotopic nature. Based on particle filter approach, our goal is to improve the transition model in order to overcome motorcycle maneuver. We will exploit this curved nature of the state space using geometric computing theory, such as Lie groups, and Lie algebras. A number of experiments have been conducted for this research, and it has been found that GDPF has achieved certain degree of success in object tracking.","Affine transformation; Deep learning; Geometric computing; Motorcycle; Nonretinotopic; Particle filter; Visual tracking","Cameras; Computation theory; Deep learning; Geometry; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Lie groups; Mathematical transformations; Monte Carlo methods; Affine transformations; Geometric computing; Nonretinotopic; Particle filter; Visual Tracking; Motorcycles",,,,,,,"(2010), http://www.tempo.co/read/news/2010/06/26/057258627/Warga-Jakarta-Rugi-Triliunan-Rupiah-Akibat-Kemacetan, Febriani, Sutji Decilya, and Endri.

In this paper, we proposed new approach without depend on specific feature. By using deep learning, we can learn essential features of many of the objects and scenes found in the real world. Furthermore, fast visual tracking can be achieved by using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The developed tracking algorithm is based on bootstrap particle filter. Thus the observation model of particle filter is enhanced into two steps: offline training step and online tracking step. The offline training stage is carried out by training one kind of deep learning techniques: Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) with auxiliary image data. During the online tracking process, an additional classification layer based on ELM is added to the encoder part of the trained. Using experiments, we found (i) the specific feature is only suitable for certain target objects (ii) the running time of the tracking algorithm can be improved by using ELM with regularization and intensity adjustment in online step, (iii) dynamic model is crucial for object tracking, especially when adjusting the diagonal covariance matrix values. Preliminary experimental results are provided. The algorithm is still restricted to track single object and will extend to track multiple object and will enhance by creating the advanced dynamic model. These are remaining for our future works. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

The efficiency of the particle filter depends mostly on the number of particles used in the estimation. This paper would like to measure the efficiency of particle filter via the Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD). The basis of the method is similar to Fox's KLD-sampling but implemented differently using resampling. The benefit of this approach is that the underlying distribution is exactly the posterior distribution. By means of batch KLD-resampling, we measure the efficiency of several dynamic models by calculating the average number of needed samples. Using experiments, we found (i) the efficiency of particle filter can be measure reliably enough using batch KLD-resampling, (ii) dynamics models affect the efficiency of particle filter, but their performance depends mostly on the case by case situationally. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Dynamic models; Efficiency; Monte Carlo methods; Target tracking; Average numbers; Dynamics models; Efficiency measurement; Kullback-Leibler distance; Particle filter; Posterior distributions; Underlying distribution; Visual object tracking; Sampling",,,,,,,"Fox, D., Adapting the sample size in particle filters through KLD-sampling (2003) International Journal of Robotics Research, 22 (12), pp. 985-1003; Li, T., Sun, S., Sattar, T.P., Adapting sample size in particle filters through KLD-resampling (2013) Electronics Letters, 49 (12), pp. 740-742. , June; Kwon, J., Lee, H.S., Park, F.C., Lee, K.M., A geometric particle filter for template-based visual tracking (2014) Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions On, 36 (4), pp. 625-643. , April; Gunawan, A.A.S., Fanany, M.I., Jatmiko, W., Deep extreme tracker based on bootstrap particle filter (2014) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 67 (1); Haug, A.J., (2012) Bayesian Estimation and Tracking: A Practical Guide., , Wiley; Gilmore, R., (2008) Lie Groups, Physics, and Geometry: An Introduction for Physicists, Engineers and Chemists, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Kwon, J., Lee, K.M., Park, F.C., Visual tracking via geometric particle filtering on the affine group with optimal importance functions (2009) IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 991-998. , Miami; Soto, A., Self adaptive particle filter (2005) International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), pp. 1398-1403. , 19th, Edinburgh, Scotland; Wang, N., Yeung, D.-Y., Learning a deep compact image representation for visual tracking (2013) Proceedings of Twenty-seventh Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems NIPS, pp. 1-9. , Lake Tahoe, Nevada; Ross, D., Lim, J., Lin, R.-S., Yang, M.-H., Incremental learning for robust visual tracking (2008) The International Journal of Computer Vision, 77 (1-3), pp. 125-141. , May; Klein, D.A., (2010) BoBoT - Bonn Benchmark on Tracking, , http://www.iai.uni-bonn.de/~kleind/tracking, Online",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2014 International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems, ICACSIS 2014","18 October 2014 through 19 October 2014",,111716,,9781479980758,,,"English","Proc. - ICACSIS: Int.

One of big challenges for visual tracking is full occlusion. When full occlusions are present, image data alone can be unreliable, and is not sufficient to detect the target object. The developed tracking algorithm is based on bootstrap particle filter and using color feature target. Furthermore the algorithm is modified using nonretinotopic concept, inspired from the way of human visual cortex handles occlusion by constructing nonretinotopic layers. We interpreted the concept by using past tracking memory about motion dynamics rather than current measurement when quality level of tracking reliability below a threshold. Using experiments, we found (i) the performance of the object tracking algorithm in handling occlusion can be improved using nonretinotopic concept, (ii) dynamic model is crucial for object tracking, especially when the target object experienced occlusion and maneuver motions, (iii) the dependency of the tracker performance on the accuracy of tracking quality threshold when facing illumination challenge.

Science, Bina Nusantara University, Jl KH Syahdan 9, Jakarta, 11480, Indonesia","Despite the concern of privacy, the method of Floating Car Data (FCD) is clearly one of the cheapest methods to provide real-time or near real-time traffic information. The method has become more affordable with the proliferation of smart-phones and with the existing infrastructure of the wireless network. In conjunction with the virtual trip lines (VTL), the FCD method can mimic the traditional traffic monitoring method on the basis of loop detectors. In addition, the use of VTL also helps the FCD method in preventing the potential of tracking the probe vehicle, which is used to gather and report the traffic information. Although vast publications regarding the FCD method are available, the issues of the optimal length of the VTL, the timeliness of the data, and the accuracy of the geo-location data have not been discussed. This article focuses and addresses these issues empirically using data collected by a probe vehicle traveling along Jakarta Inner Road Highway in Jakarta, Indonesia. Those data are collected using ten smart-phones of the same type. As the result, the optimal trip line length can be established as a function of the level of accuracy of the geo-location data. In the case where the level of accuracy is 32 m, we determine a VTL length of 26 m should provide 95% chance that the probe vehicle will cross the line. In addition, the currently developed system can also provide about 80% of the traffic data in less than 1 min, and the remaining 20% data within 1-5 min interval. Finally, by applying a simple moving average filter, the prediction of the traffic velocity can be increased significantly, and the geo-location data error can be reduced up to 20%. © 2014 IEEE.","Advanced Traveler Information System; Floating Car Data; Global Positioning System; Intelligent Transportation Systems","Global positioning system; Intelligent systems; Probes; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Traffic control; Floating car data; Intelligent transportation systems; Moving average filter; Probe vehicles; Real-time traffic datum; Real-time traffic information; Traffic information; Traffic monitoring; Advanced traveler information systems",,,,,,,"Arnott, R., Does providing information to drivers reduce traffic congestion?

A technology, so called Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), has long been developed to address this issue. The traffic congestion is addressed by ITS using a set of information and telecommunication technology. This technology strongly depends on traffic sensors to record the traffic data such as the traffic flow, the traffic speed, and the traffic density. In this research, we develop a traffic sensor technology using a simple camera to record the traffic data. The video recorded by a camera is then analyzed using computer vision techniques to recognize the types of the objects. In this application, occlusion is major cause of information loss. The research intends to implement the object feature point technique to handle occlusion in the traffic data recorded using a low cost camera. These feature points of objects can overcome the occlusion problem because the approach uses intrinsic feature points such as movement and distance between the feature points; therefore, in a mixed and dense traffic, one can still record the traffic data from various vehicles. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Clustering; Feature points analysis; Intelligent transportation system; Object tracking; Traffic surveillance",,,,,,,,"Winarno, H., (2011), http://oto.detik.com/read/2011/02/10/172849/1568834/648/ rp-107-triliun-bbm-yang-dihambur-hamburkan-ketika-macet, February 11, Dipetik February 3, 2012, dari Detik Oto; Lien, C.C., (2007) Targets Tracking in the Crowd, , Departement of Computer Science and Information Engineering.

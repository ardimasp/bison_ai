Several methods have been used to detect vulnerabilities in web applications such as black-box testing, dynamic analysis, and static analysis. In this article, we propose a framework for detecting web application vulnerabilities by combining all three methods. The strengths of one method are used to overcome the weaknesses of another method. This framework is believed to provide better results than if each method was used separately. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"This research was supported by Universitas Stikubank Semarang.

These works are implemented at the computers network layers. The stegblock will convert the transactions data which sent among network into other data's form, it means the data such as ID Number, Account Number, Passwords and others are converted with other data called cover. Finally, the system sends the cover without the real data, it just represented data and able to read by the receiver.

The complexity of the software can increase the possibility of defects. Defective software can cause high losses. Fixing defective software requires a high cost because it can spend up 50% of the project schedule. Most software developers don't document their work properly so that making it difficult to analyse software development history data. Software metrics which use in cross-project software defects prediction have many features. Software metrics usually consist of various measurement techniques, so there are possibilities for their features to be similar. It is possible that these features are similar or irrelevant so that they can cause a decrease in the performance of classifiers. In this study, several feature selection techniques were proposed to select the relevant features. The classification algorithm used is Naive Bayes. Based on the analysis using ANOVA, the SBS and SBFS models can significantly improve the performance of the Naïve Bayes model. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bayesian networks; Defects; Feature extraction; Sodium compounds; Classification algorithm; Development history; Measurement techniques; Performance of classifier; Relevant features; Selection techniques; Software defect prediction; Software developer; Software design",,,,,,"Adak, M.F., Software defect detection by using data mining based fuzzy logic (2018) 2018 Sixth Int.

With customer payments, it is usually easier to make payments with mobile payment, because it is more practical and direct than mobile banking. However, is the privacy of both platforms understood by the customer? Research questions to be answered: 1) What are the factors that influence privacy issues in mobile banking? 2) What are the factors that influence privacy issues with mobile payments? 3) What are the factors that influence confidence in mobile banking? 4) What are the factors that influence confidence in mobile payments? 5) Does the privacy factor influence the perceived privacy? 6) Does the confidence factor influence the perceived privacy?

Speech as input to Google is known as the Ok Google feature. However, many search engine users never pay attention to search engine definitions. So, websites are only limited to projects without further management, and that is what happens to the current website. Therefore, in this study, an assessment of usability is conducted on Google especially in the Ok Google feature using Nielsen Model. The research method used in this research is the quantitative research approach, a method which includes approach and kind of research, population and sample, instrument, data collection technique, and data analyze. Data collection techniques include learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors and satisfaction assessment and Likert scale ranges from 1 to 4. It can be signed into categories of sites with usability values, namely “very difficult to understand,” “difficult to understand”, “easy to understand” and “very easy to understand”. The construct validity is with Orthogonal Iterations with Index reliability of 0.91. The results of this study are the usability testing of Ok Google tends to be significance (α) of 5% with data of 124 is 1.66, feedback statement in the questionnaire is considered valid, then the questionnaire results show α = 0.91 which means the measurement of usability on Ok Google Feature is an excellent level. The average usability value obtained by Ok Google in Indonesia is included in the category of usability “easy to understand”. In addition, it was found that Ok Google has the highest memorability level and the lowest error. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Speech recognition; Usability; Website",,,,,,,"Qustoniah, A., Perancangan Sistem Pengenalan Pola Suara Menggunakan Metode Piecewise Dynamic Time Warping (2012) Widya Tek, 20 (1), pp. 11-17; Ronando, E., Irawan, M.I., Pengenalan Ucapan Kata Sebagai Pengendali Metode Linear Predictive Coding—Neuro Fuzzy (2012) J.

To allocate land use properly, the zoning method has been widely used, especially in densely populated cities, namely a kind of sustainable urban form with considers the mix of use/diversity of land use to minimize travel distance. This study proposes a method for calculating how much a city meets the sustainable urban forms based on compact city criteria, i.e. compatibility, dependency, and compactness. After the survey filling in compatibility and dependency scores for each land use, and compactness was calculated for each sub-district. Fuzzy C-Means clustering was used to cluster the result to classify other areas. In addition, this method can be used by planners to check whether their plans meet the concept of sustainable development or not. © 2019 IEEE.","city plan; compactness; compatibility; dependency; sustainable urban form","Land use; Sustainable development; City planners; Compact city; Filling in; Fuzzy C means clustering; Self-learning; Travel distance; Urban sustainability; Zoning method; Planning",,,,,,"Curwell, S., Deakin, M., Symes, M., (2005) Sustainable Urban Development, 1. , United Kingdom Routledge; Steiner, F., (2008) The Living Landscape-An Ecological Approach to Landscape Planning-Second Edition, , Washington DC ISLAND PRESS; Handayanto, R., Tripathi, N.K., Kim, S.M., Herlawati, H., Land use growth simulation and optimization for achieving a sustainable urban form (2018) TELKOMNIKA Telecommunication Comput.

Each data taken will be preprocessing, where the process was done by removing punctuation, hash tags and conversion of several emojis to text. By using the polyglotlibrary, determining an emotion from each term can be done more easily because the library can recognize various languages, including Indonesian. This experiment achieves55.41% accuracy.

With gamification, a lot of people help people learn something natural, and gamification is usually inspired by everyday life, for example, the game The Sims, which combines daily life with a game in sports is one of the best examples of gamification implementation. Using gamification in a game makes learning more enjoyable than learning with truth, and without realizing it they have done learning. In this paper we proposed a gamification architecture for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) which include logic game such as brain, think, body, move, sport and logic. Moreover, there are five methods proposed for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) such as object game, content, and player, design, and framework, deploy and play, and finish structure. © 2018 IEEE.","ADHD games;

Specifically review the effects of facilitation methods and teacher involvement in student participation in online discussion forums. In the trial attended by 94 teachers, 193 classes and 5104 students, to compare the level of student participation in the online discussion forums held in all study programs in the Faculty of Law, Faculty of Law, University of Pamulang The participation of the students as the dependent variable in the two methods facilitated the discussion, the discussion was facilitated by the students as an experimental class and the discussions were facilitated by the teachers as a kind of control. Teacher participation as a covariate. In general, the results show that the amount of student participation in student issues initiated by the students is superior to the discussion topics initiated by the teachers, once the level of teacher participation is adjusted. The discussion topic made by the students encourages students to participate more than the topic of discussion made by the teachers, because the students are more interested in the topics that interest them. This study has the effect of facilitating participation in online learning discussion forums at the level of student participation. The results also show that the freedom granted to students to make the topic of discussion is not influenced by the size or participation of the teacher. © 2019 The Authors.","E-learning; Effectiveness of learning; Facilitation methods","Information systems; Information use; Learning systems; Online systems; Social networking (online); Students; Dependent variables; Discussion forum; Effectiveness of learning; Electronic learning systems; Facilitation methods; Online discussion forums; Online learning; Student participation; E-learning",,,,,,"Jacobson, D., Chapman, R., Ye, C., Os, J.V., A project-based approach to executive education (2017) Journal of Innovative Educations; Allen, E., Seaman, J., (2009) Learning on Demand, , Babson; Ferre, C., Glynn, H., Wiest, Lynda, R., Effective online instruction in higher education (2012) Quarterly Review of Distance Education, 13 (1), pp. 11-14; Romero, C., Lopez, M.I., Luna, J.M., Ventura, S., (2013) Predicting Students Final Performance from Participation in On-Online Discussion Forum, , Elsevier; Wisneski, J.E., Ozogul, G., Bichelmeyer, B.A., (2015) Does Teaching Presence Transfer between MBA Teaching Environments?

The use of the flipped classroom has been running in this department for four semesters, where in one semester, each class gets a subject that is taught by a flipped classroom method. Questionnaires were distributed online among students from level one to three in October 2018 and 249 respondents were obtained. The data obtained were analyzed using descriptive statistics in order to study the perception of the students about the application of the flipped classroom, both in general and from the four aspects of the engagement: behavioral, emotional, cognitive and agentic engagement. The results obtained show that most of the respondents (61%) agreed with the use of flipped classroom because the class became more fun. In terms of engagement, behavioral engagement has the highest mean value of 3.12 while agent engagement has the lowest mean value of 2.42. It means that students have shown an attitude to follow the flipped classroom method but have not actively participated. The rest where students disagreed with flipped classroom is due to lecturers assumed unprepared and/or students have difficulty learning by themselves. © IAEME Publication.","Aspects; Engagement; Evaluation; Flipped Learning; Perception",,,,,,,"Chicca, J., Shellenbarger, T., Connecting with generation Z: Approaches in nursing education (2018) Teach.

Jakarta is one of the big cities and is the capital of Indonesia. This study aims to provide solutions to congestion problems in the capital city by maximizing the intelligent transportation system, convenient and safe for passengers. This research finds the fact that people's need for Trans Jakarta is relatively high but in fact it is not directly proportional to the public interest towards the use of Trans Jakarta buses. This study finds issues related to the needs and expectations of the community using Trans Jakarta facilities. Not only convenience and security and cheap price offered but also the ease and speed in transacting. This research provides ideas related to the facilities provided by Trans Jakarta as one of public transportation owned by the government. Combining smart phones with the use of internet-based technology (IOT). This research proposed an integrated system (integration platform). The solution with IOT-based technology enhancements makes it easy to present all information about bus availability, bus scheduling, booking places and easy online payment. This study uses a comparative study related to the needs of passengers in using Trans Jakarta.

One of the benchmarks used is to measure the level of maturity of IT Governance. COBIT 5 becomes the main reference that is often used for these needs. But to do the assessment takes a long time because of the many processes assessed. This becomes an obstacle for a very dynamic company, the business has changed but the new assessment is completed. The authors propose a new approach using a priority model that adopts a enterprise strategy and incorporates it with a follow-up of previous IT Governance audit results. Tests have been conducted one of the state-owned enterprises in Indonesia engaged in the financial sector and has a dynamic business. The results showed that the assessment can effectively improve the quality of corporate IT objectives with the acceleration of the assessment process up to 20%. © 2018 IEEE.","COBIT 5; Effective assessment; Enterprise IT Goals; IT Governance; IT on State Own Company; Prioritisation Approach","COBIT 5; Effective assessment; Enterprise IT; IT governance; On state; Prioritisation Approach",,,,,,"Steuperaert, D., Improving the quality of the COBIT 5 goals cascade as an it process prioritisation mechanism (2016) International Journal of IT/Business Alignment and Governance, 7 (2), pp. 49-69; Pasquini, A., Galie, E., COBIT 5 and the process capability model.

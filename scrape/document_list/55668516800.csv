The admissibility of digital evidence depends on sever-al factors, including improper handling, virus infection, deliberate tampering, or faultyhardware that might compromise its integrity. The integrity of digital evidence is highlydependent on use of a cryptographic hash function to provide a seal on the evidence. Inthis paper, we analyze the causes of evidence inadmissibility to the courts, specifically dur-ing a chain of custody in which the evidence is passed from one investigator to another,and therefore is at risk of compromise. We introduce a confidence level of admissibility toidentify the percentage of trust accorded to evidence. When the level of integrity is intact,then the confidence level of admissibility is 100%. For evidence under investigation, theconfidence level is reduced as the changes have been made to the documents. We proposea framework for establishing the confidence level of evidence admissibility. Based on thisframework, we construct a model that enables the calculation of the confidence level ofadmissibility, from which we can produce a history log for document traceability. © 2019, ICIC International.

The automotive industry today is reaching out to wider range of users, being accessible in various shapes, sizes and range of mobility. However, the still ongoing vehicular thefts and the fact that it's also difficult at times to report to authorities in regards of the matter has brought forth several problems, such as lack of necessary means to reclaim vehicles, expensive GPS tracker prices, all while having the aforementioned tools that are not quite user-friendly. Using research and experiments on Arduino micro-controllers, and mobile development using Android Studio SDK, such a system was developed. From this system, which was tested by various ranges of age and occupation, it has been concluded and proven that a creation of fair-priced, user-friendly, and functional tracking system is very much possible. This system also operates offline, which is very useful when users are lacking internet connections. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The more Software Developers means the more competition in Software Development. Software metric for effort estimation is a strategy to use metrics related to effort estimation in software development becomes necessary to determine the effort required to develop the system and hence determine pricing (in the case of software house). Several methods exist to estimate effort. This research discusses the Use Case Point Method using a Student Desk Portal as the study case. The effort calculated based on Use Case method may differ from the actual case. In this paper, the differences are analyzed, and an adjustment factor is constructed to resolve the differences between the effort estimated by use case point and the actual effort placed in the actual software development. A new criterion is introduced by using data from the actual software development, be used as further adjustment to the effort obtained by using Use Case Point method. This new criteria, the simplicity of project is added to be a part of the environment factor. The result is positive, the effort calculated by Use Case Point for three different application is in accordance with the actual result. © 2019 The Authors.

One of the important role in development is application development which is the main element in the development of technology. Due to this reason, it is required to have an application that would satisfy the criteria of standard qualities without any tolerance towards error and failure during process. This paper focused on the design of indicator that can be used in measuring qualities in application development, with Student Desk Portal at Bina Nusantara University used as case study is accessed by thousands of students each week. For this reason, the quality of the application is extremely important. The designed indicators are applied in the development of 35 modules in the Student Desk Portal application. The result shows that after applying the designed indicators in the application development, the number of bugs and errors found in the implementation drastically reduced from 43% to 23%. © 2018 The Author(s).","Indicator; Quality Software Application; Software Metric; Student Desk Portal","Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Indicators (instruments); Program debugging; Students; Application development; Daily lives; Information technology and communications; Quality software; Quality software development; Software metrices; Study case; Software design",,,,,,"Florac, W.A., Software Quality Measurement: A Framework for Counting Problems (1992) Failures and Faults.

The integrity of the digital evidence must be maintained through the chain of custody in order to be admissible in court. Most digital extraction tool use either MD5 (Message Digest) or SHA (Secured Hash Algorithm) hashing to check the integrity of digital evidence. The hashing algorithm has been found to have a weakness known as collision in which two different messages have the same hashing values. Although the probability of producing such weakness is very small, this collision can be used to deny the usage of the evidence in court of justice. After the first collision has been found, many cryptanalysts have tried to explore various methods to detect the collisions with shorter and efficient time. This paper is to review the existing methods in digital forensic tools that have been used to create a collision attacks in digital evidence. © 2017 The Authors.

The problem is that live messenger runs under a network with limited security and therefore facing threats such as interception, authenticity, interruption and fabrication. The purpose of this research is to design security protocol on live messenger that ensures authenticity and data or message confidentiality whenever data/messages are sent from one user to another user. The protocol is designed to ensure that no one except the authorized user are allowed to communicate to each other. The proposed protocol is an end-to-end protocol, where each user can only comunicate once each of the user are authenticated and have secured connections to each other. The researcher is designing this end-to-end protocol and perform a simulation to show that the communcation line is secured. The result shows that the communication line established is secured and the user can send messages in confidential. It is also shown in the simulation that if a attacker tries to intercept, it will be aknowledged by the users and the attacker is blocked and not able to establish connection. © 2015 The Authors.

Especially when it comes to patient's conditions, such that it will be reported to a physician as soon as possible, including monitoring the patient's conditions regularly. For this reason it is necessary to have a Hospital Monitoring Information System, that is able to provide information about the patient's condition which is based on the four vital signs, temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiration. To monitor the 4 vital signs, the concept of fuzzy logic is used, where the vital signs number approaches 1 then the patient is close to recovery, and on the contrary, when the vital signs number approaches 0 then the patient still has problems. This system also helps nurses to provide answers to the relatives of patients, who wants to know the development of the patient's condition, including the recovery percentage based on the average of Fuzzy max from the 4 vital signs. Using Fuzzy-based monitoring system, the monitoring of the patient's condition becomes simpler and easier. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.","Fuzzy; Fuzzy max; In-patient; Patient; Vital signs",,,,,,,"Adil, R., (2009) Perancangan Sistem Monitoring Online Pada Penderita Jantung Coroner Berbasis Identifikasi Sinyal Elevasi, , Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya, Jurnal Tekomnika; Alan Dix, J.F., (2005) Human-computer Interaction 3r D Edition, , Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458: Pearson Education, Inc; Jefrey, L., Whitten, L.D., (2004) System Analysis & Design Methods 6 Edition, , Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10020: Mc-Graw Hill Companies, Inc; Kusumadewi, S., (2003) Artificial Inteligence (Teknik Dan Applikasinya), , Jogjakarta: Graha Ilmu; Mustofa, Z., (2011) Analisis Dan Perancangan Prototype Sistem Informasi Pemantauan Perkembangan Kesehatan Pasien Panti Rehabilitasi Napza Berbasis Web Dan Mobile Access, , Thesis, UGM; Pressman, R.S., (2005) Software Engineering A Practitioner's Approach 6 Th Edition, , Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10020: McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc; Sheiderman, B., (1998) Designing the User Interface Strategies for Effective 3 Rd Edition., , Addison Wesley Longman, Inc; Stuart Russell, P.N., (2003) Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach 2 Nd Edition, , Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458: Pearson Education, Inc; Tanebaum, A.S., (2003) Computer Networks 4 Th Edition., , Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458: Prentice Hall PTR; Thomas Connolly, C.B., (2005) Database Systems, , England: Pearson Education, Inc; Vaughan, T., (2004) Multimedia: Making It Work 6 Th Edition, , 1333 Burr Ridge Parkway, Burr Ridge, IL 60527: McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc; Hofstetter, F.T., (2001) Multimedia Literacy 3 Th Edition, , 1221 Avenue of The Americas, New York, NY, 10020: McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc",,,"","EDP Sciences","2013 International Conference on Advances Science and Contemporary Engineering, ICASCE 2013","23 October 2013 through 24 October 2013","Jakarta",,21016275,,,,"English","EPJ Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901406741

PGA is calculated using attenuation function that describes the correlation between the local ground movement intensity the earthquake magnitude and the distance from the earthquake's epicentre. The data used comes from the earthquake damage catalogue available from the Indonesia meteorology, climatology and geophysics agency (BMKG) with range from year 1973-2011. The research methodology consists of six steps, which is developing the grid, calculation of the distance from the epicentre to the centroid of the grid, calculation of PGA values, developing the computer application, plotting the PGA values to the centroid grid, and developing the earthquake hazard zones using kriging algorithm. The conclusion of this research is that the global attenuation function that was developed by [20] can be applied to calculate the PGA values in the city of Banda Aceh. Banda Aceh city in micro scale can be divided into three hazard zones which is low hazard zone with PGA value of 0.8767 gals up to 0.8780 gals, medium hazard zone with PGA values of 0.8781 up to 0.8793 gals and high hazard zone with PGA values of 0.8794 up to 0.8806 gals. © IOP Publishing Ltd 2013.",,"Geophysics; Hazards; Safety engineering; Attenuation function; Earthquake damages; Earthquake hazard; Earthquake magnitudes; Kriging algorithm; Peak ground acceleration; Research methodologies; Seismic hazards; Earthquakes",,,,,,"Atkinson, G.M., Boore, D.M., Empirical ground-motion relations for subduction-zone earthquakes and their application to Cascadia and other regions (2003) Society, 93 (4), pp. 1703-1729; (2002) (In Bahasa) Standar Nasional Indonesia-Tata Cara Perencanaan Ketahanan Gempa Untuk Bangunan Gedung, , Badan Standarisasi Nasional; Balendra, T., Li, Z., Seismic Hazard of Singapore and Malaysia (2008) Earthquake, pp. 57-63. , 1000-3274; Campbell, K.W., Prediction of Strong Ground Motion Using the Hybrid Empirical Method and Its Use in the Development of Ground-Motion (Attenuation) Relations in Eastern North America (2003) Society, 93 (3), pp. 1012-1033; (2005), Indonesia State Ministry for National Planning Development Agency/BAPPENAS; Gregor, N.J., Silva, W.J., Wong, I.G., Youngs, R.R., Ground-Motion Attenuation Relationships for Cascadia Subduction Zone Megathrust Earthquakes Based on a Stochastic Finite-Fault Model (2002) Society, 92 (5), pp. 1923-1932; Irsyam, M., Dangkua, D.T., Hendriyawan, Hoedajanto, D., Hutapeabm, Kertapati, E.K., Boen, T., Petersen, M.D., Proposed seismic hazard maps of Sumatra and Java islands and microzonation study of Jakarta city Indonesia (2008) Earth System Sci., pp. 865-878; Irwansyah, E., (2010) Building Damage Assessment Using Remote Sensing, Aerial Photograph and GIS Data: Case Study in Banda Aceh after Sumatera Earthquake 2004, 11, p. 57; Kramer, S.L., (1996) Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering.; Lin, P.-S., Lee, C.-T., Ground-Motion Attenuation Relationships for Subduction-Zone Earthquakes in Northeastern Taiwan (2008) Bulletin of the Seismological Society America, 98 (1), pp. 220-240. , 10.1785/0120060002 0037-1106; Miura, H., Wijeyewickrema, A., Inoue, S., (2006) Evaluation of Tsunami Damage in the Eastern Part of Sri Lanka Due to the 2004 Sumatra Earthquake Using High-Resolution Satellite Images, , http://ares.tu.chiba-u.jp/workshop/ChibaRS2005/Paper_Miura.pdf, [Sep.13, 2005]; Megawati, K., Pan, T.C., Koketsu, K., Response spectral attenuation relationships for Sumatran-subduction earthquakes and the seismic hazard implications to Singapore and Kuala Lumpur (2005) Soil Dynamics Earthquake Eng., 25 (1), pp. 11-25. , 10.1016/j.soildyn.2004.08.003 0267-7261; Megawati, K., Pan, T.-C., Ground-motion attenuation relationship for the Sumatran megathrust earthquakes (2010) Earthquake., 827-845. , 1000-3274; Fischer, M.M., Getis, A., (2010) Handbook of Applied Spatial Analysis: Software Tools, Method, and Applications, , 10.1007/978-3-642-03647-7; Petersen, M.D., Dewey, J., Hartzell, S., Mueller, C., Harmsen, S., Frankel, A.D., Rukstales, K., Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis for Sumatra, Indonesia and across the Southern Malaysian Peninsula (2004) Tectonophysics, 390 (1-4), pp. 141-158. , 10.1016/j.tecto.2004.03.026 0040-1951; Sengara, I.W., (2008) Seismic Hazard and Microzonation for A District in Banda Aceh City Post 2004 Great Sumatra Earthquake; (2009) Historic World Earthquakes, , http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/historical_country. php#indonesia, USGS, [November 23th, 2009]; (2012) Magnitude 8.6-Off The West Coast Of Northern Sumatra, , http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/usc000905e.php, USGS, [May 13th, 2012]; Villaverde, R., (2009) Fundamental Concepts of Earthquake Engineering; Youngs, (1997)",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","2013 International Conference on Science and Engineering in Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics, ScieTech 2013","24 January 2013 through 25 January 2013","Jakarta",96723,17426588,,,,"English","J.

For each level of education, at the end of the learning process, an evaluation was typically carried out through examinations either verbally, written (in the form of either paper-based or computer-based and offline or online) or both. The problem to be faced by visually impaired student is the written exam requires to read the questions and write the answers. This study aims to proposed a novel concept of the test model with Yes-No answers for visual impairments students at elementary level by adopting EEG-based brain computer interface (BCI) technology at elementary level.

Educational institutions that provide open networks and connected to many devices simultaneously become an exciting testing ground for cybercriminals. Anti-virus is often used as prevention by applying signature-based detection of specific tiles contained in the database. Unfortunately, because much new malware continues to grow, the detection of the database becomes inaccurate. Therefore, automatic detection has been carried out using Autoencoder hybridized with ANN and CNN approaches. It will be developed using Python programming language with computer specification of 16GB RAM and Processor i7-7500U. Samples used are malware dataset obtained from various types of repositories such as virussign.com, the Zoo, and certain libraries from researchers. The dimensions of samples will be reconstructed using Autoencoder to generate new values that will be used as input on ANN and CNN. This research also has been developed Principal Component Analysis as a comparison architecture. Those approaches provide outstanding results in detecting malware, scilicet PCA-ANN with an accuracy of 0.985, PCACNN with an accuracy of 0.963, Autoencoder -ANN with an accuracy of 0.994, and Autoencoder -CNN with an accuracy of 0.970. Therefore, those approaches can be used as reference in increasing the need for educational institutions to improve their security from malware by detecting tiles that will be sent or read by each user. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial;

Nevertheless, the mistakenness in the fulfillment of nutrition still concerned. It happens because an individual does not have much knowledge about the energy content of food and food combination to meet the nutrition requirement. The objectives of this research are to facilitate an individual to obtain the optimum nutrition intake from their daily dietary habit. This paper proposes a Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) algorithm to find the optimum combination of food portion and food option for an individual daily dietary habit. The food data is obtained from 'Tabel Komposisi Pangan Indonesia' book which contains more than 1600 kind of Indonesian food. The results show that BPSO provides an optimum nutrition intake accuracy of 99.14%. Moreover, the nutritionist is already validated that this experiment is succeed in recommending a variation of daily dietary habit that meet an optimum nutrition intake for an individual. Based on this result it can be conducted that BPSO can provide the better accuracy of optimum nutrition intake than Genetic Algorithm (GA), while GA can only provide an optimum nutrition intake accuracy of 97.87%. © 2019 The Authors.

The challenging part of food image recognition is to recognize a food image with different background, intensity, and perspective. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) seems to be the right choice to build a powerful model that able to recognize food image accurately. Current researches in food recognition use American fast food and Japanese food as the dataset. Different dataset has different treatment to obtain good result. Color and presentation has important role as features. Therefore, this research proposes to recognize five kinds of popular Indonesian food such as meatball (bakso), grilled chicken (ayam bakar), satay (sate), gado-gado (mixed vegetables with peanut sauce), and rendang using Convolutional Neural Network approach. Convolutional Neural Network with standard architecture and inception-v4 model are chosen as techniques with Adam as the optimizer function. Experimental results show the implementation of CNN for image recognition can achieve the top-1 testing accuracy around 76.3% for standard network and 95.2% for inception-v4 network. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,"Convolution; Neural networks; Convolutional neural network; Different treatments; Food image; Health industry; Japanese foods; Optimizers; Standard architecture; Testing accuracy; Image recognition",,,,"Binus University","The authors thank to Bina Nusantara University for the research grant and supporting this research.","Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L., ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database (2009) IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2009, pp. 248-255; Hinton, G.E., Srivastava, N., Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Salakhutdinov, R.R., (2012) Improving Neural Networks by Preventing Co-Adaptation of Feature Detectors, , arXiv preprint arXiv; Ioffe, S., Szegedy, C., (2015) Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift, , arXiv preprint arXiv; Kagaya, H., Aizawa, K., Ogawa, M., Food detection and recognition using convolutional neural network (2014) Proceedings of the 22Nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 1085-1088. , pp., ACM; Kawano, Y., Yanai, K., Real-time mobile food recognition system (2013) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pp. 1-7. , pp; Kingma, D.P., Ba, J., (2014) Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization, , arXiv preprint arXiv; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1097-1105. , pp; Lecun, Y., Boser, B.E., Denker, J.S., Henderson, D., Howard, R.E., Hubbard, W.E., Jackel, L.D., Handwritten digit recognition with a back-propagation network (1990) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 396-404. , pp; Nair, V., Hinton, G.E., Rectified linear units improve restricted boltzmann machines (2010) In: Proceedings of the 27Th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML; Pan, S.J., Yang, Q., A survey on transfer learning (2010) IEEE Trans.

For this time, deficiency surveillance is carried on manually which needs more effort especially for large area. With rapid growth of technology, it is possible to build a system via smartphone to detect the nutrient deficiency of plants. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional neural network to diagnose condition based on image of plants. Inception-Resnet architecture with transfer learning and fine tuning from model that is previously trained using ImageNet dataset is applied in the experi- ments. We trained the model further with image of okra plants. The dataset consists of 184 images for the training process and 47 images for testing. Image augmentation method is also used to increase the variation of the dataset. The experimental results show that fine tuning approach achieves the best accuracy, namely 96% and 86% for training and testing respectively.

The government has an important role in economic growth. However, there are still many civil servants who abuse their positions to do corruption. The central government should pay more attention to each region to avoid corruption cases. For developing a mapping system, Naïve Bayes classifier is needed to classify news about corruption and non-corruption. N-Gram and Hash Table were used to map corruption cases based on Indonesia’s administrative territory. The experimental results showed that Naïve Bayes classification achieved 100% accuracy for training and testing.

Optimum cost for running this industry is a necessity so that power generated can be produce according to power demand with appropriate cost. Economic dispatch is an optimization approach in power system plant with objective function is to minimize cost by finding appropriate arrangement of generator output according electric requirement and capacity of the system. Previous researches have been proposed techniques to solve this problem, however a stable convergence and good computational efficiency is still required. Therefore, this paper proposes bat algorithm to minimize total generator cost from thermal power plant. Bat algorithm is one of nature inspired optimization problem which has advantage in stable convergence. The experiment results show that Bat algorithm is able to save approximately 1.23% compare to the actual cost and 0.12% to firefly algorithm. © 2018 The Authors.

Imbalanced nutrition increases risk of health problems. Balanced nutrition means the difference between nutrition needed and nutrition intake must be as minimum as possible. The condition in Indonesian, many people consume food with high carbohydrate; whereas nutrition consists of protein, carbohydrate, and fat. That nutrition obtains from five foods category, namely: main dish (MP), vegetable side dish (LN), meat (LH), vegetable (SY), and fruit (BH). Therefore, it needs a system to provide a suggestion for balanced nutrition. This research used Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) to obtain optimal nutrition, which contains five dimensions (MP, LH, LN, SY, BH). These dimension and variable are represented as food source, which will be optimized by bees. These bees are divided into employee bee (BN), onlooker bee (SN), and scout bee. BN will produce new food source, where if new food source has a better solution, it will replace the old one. SN performers based on the fitness value of each food source; if the food source has high probability, SN will produce new food source. While scout bee will determine a new food source, if the number of trials for releasing a food source is equal to the value of 'limit'. The performance of ABC evaluated using twelve data of men and female. The result shows that ABC achieve 99.90% in giving a recommendation for portion and type of foods a day. © 2016 IEEE.","Artificial Bee Colony; Computational Intelligence; Daily Nutrition; Food Recommendation; Optimization","Artificial intelligence; Carbohydrates; Health risks; Optimization; Vegetables; Artificial bee colonies; Artificial bee colonies (ABC); Fitness values; Food sources; Healthy lifestyles; High probability; Nutrition",,,,,,"Kementrian Kesehatan, R.I., (2010) Badan Penelitian Dan Pengembangan Kesehatan (Balitbang), , Riset Kesehatan Dasar (Riskesdas).

The premise of this research is fraudulent transaction contains 'anomaly' from the pattern of non-fraudulent transactions so that the anomalous pattern can be detected and separated at some point using classification models. Less availability dataset for research, non-stationary distribution of the data, highly imbalanced class distributions, and continuous streams of transactions become the main driven of using CHAID and k-NN classification method. Empiric result using actual debit card transaction using ATM services shows that Accuracy of CHAID model is 0.8 and F = 0.7; and k-NN model (for k=3) is 0.7 and F = 0.6 These results are comparable to previous studies using Hidden Markov Models. © 2016 IEEE.","CHAID; debit card fraud recognition; k-NN","Classification (of information); Crime; Hidden Markov models; Markov processes; CHAID; Classification models; Debit cards; Fraudulent transactions; Imbalanced class; K-nearest neighbors; K-NN classifications; Transaction records; Nearest neighbor search",,,,,,"Case, P., Sisat, S.N., (2014) Secured Automatic Teller Machine (ATM).

Nevertheless, there are still many occurrences of government officers abusing their offices to do an act of corruption. In this order, the central government should pay attention to every area in the nation to avoid corruption case. Meanwhile, the news media always constantly preach about corruption case, this makes the news media relevant for being one of the sources of measurement of corruption perception index (CPI). It is required to map the corruption case in Indonesia so the central government can pay attention to every region in Indonesia. To develop the mapping system, researchers use Naïve Bayes Classifier to classify which news articles talk about corruption and which news articles are not, before implementing a Naïve Bayes Classifier there are some text processing such as tokenizing, stopping, and stemming. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Economics; Mapping; Sodium; Text processing; Bayes Classifier; Central government; Corruption perception indices; Economic growths; Mapping systems; News articles; News media; Tokenizing; Crime",,,,,,"Ghosh, R., Siddique, M., (2014) Corruption, Good Governance and Economic Development: Contemporary Analysis and Case Studies.; Huang, J., Lu, J., Ling, C., (2003) Comparing Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and SVM with AUC and Accuracy.; Jang, S., Woo, W., 5W1H: Unified User-Centric Context (2005) Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing.; Malik, D., (2001) Dari Konstruksi Ke Dekonstruksi: Refleksi Atas Pemberitaan Televisi Kita.; Melgar, N., Rossi, M., Smith, T.W., The Perception of Corruption (2010) International Journal of Public Opinion Research, 22 (1), pp. 120-131; Murphy, K.P., (2006) Naive Bayes Classifiers Generative Classifiers, 4701, pp. 1-8; Olteanu, A., Peshterliev, S., Liu, X., Aberer, K., Web Credibility: Features Exploration and Credibility Prediction (2013) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), pp. 557-568; Persson, A., Rothstein, B., Teorell, J., Why Anti Corruption Reforms Fail - Systemic Corruption as a Collective Action Problem (2013) Governance, 26 (3), pp. 449-471; Rahimi, R., Shakeri, H., Reflection on Judicial System's Corruption and Offering Solutions to Promote its Safety (2016) Journal of Politics and Law, 9 (9), p. 187; Rohwer, A., Measuring Corruption: A Comparison between the Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index and the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators (2009) DICE, pp. 42-52; Schrenk, M., (2007) Webbots, Spiders, and Screen Scrapers.; Tala, F., (2003) A Study of Stemming Effects on Information Retrieval in Bahasa Indonesia; Tated, R.R., Ghonge, M.M., A survey on text mining - Techniques and application (2015) International Journal of Research in Advent Technology, 1, pp. 380-385; Uca, N., Ince, H., Sumen, H., The Mediator Effect of Logistics Performance Index on the Relation between Corruption Perception Index and Foreign Trade Volume (2016) European Scientific Journal, 12 (25), pp. 1857-7881; Yang, J.M., Cai, R., Wang, C., Huang, H., Zhang, L., Ma, W.Y., Incorporating Site-Level Knowledge for Incremental Crawling of Web Forums: A List-Wise Strategy (2009) Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1375-1383",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Computing and Applied Informatics, ICCAI 2016","14 December 2016 through 15 December 2016",,127044,17426588,,,,"English","J.

This research are developed since it becomes common habit to take a picture in any activities, for instances before having a meal. Capturing image of meal allows to extract information which contain in food for health reference. The challenge in food recognition that these objects have various shape and appearances, especially Indonesian food, which may have different character for same type of food based on origin of foods. This research proposes a technique in food recognition, especially Indonesian food, using SIFT and machine learning techniques. K-Dimensional Tree (K-D Tree) and Backpropagation Neural network (BPNN) are chosen as machine learning techniques to recognize three types of Indonesian food namely Bakso, Ayam bakar and Sate. Experimental results shows BPNN has higher accuracy compare to K-D Tree which is 51% and 44% for BPNN and K-D Tree respectively. © 2017 The Authors.

Energy requirement is determined based on Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)—which is affected by weights, heights, age and gender—and physical activity level (PAL). While energy intake is calculated based on calorie from each portion of food consumed. This food consists of five principal elements, namely main dish, vegetable side dish, meat, vegetable and fruit. In the daily life, the difference between energy requirement and energy intake must be set as minimum as possible in order to avoid overweight or underweight condition. However, an individual is still having difficulty in determining the ideal portion of every kind of food that will be consumed in everyday. Therefore it is important to develop a system which gives the information regarding an optimal portion of each kind of food for an individual consumption. Genetic Algorithm(GA) is used to find the best portion and composition of food so that it will provide a proportional energy intake according to individual requirement. In the analysis we compare the results from GA and linear programming approach, the experiment shows that GA is succeed in giving proportional portion and composition as well as providing the diversity of food based on individual requirement. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Energy intake; Energy requirement; Food suggestion; Genetic algorithm; Nutrition","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Intelligent systems; Linear programming; Nutrition; Vegetables; Daily activity; Daily lives; Energy intake; Energy requirements; Genetic algorithm approach; Metabolic rates; Physical activity levels; Genetic algorithms",,,,,,"Amine, E., Baba, N., Belhadj, M., Deurenbery-Yap, M., Djazayery, A., Forrester, T., Galuska, D., Yoshiike, N., (2003) Introduction.

Conditions of bearings commonly are reflected by vibration signals data. In multiple bearing condition diagnosis, it will involve many types of vibration signals data; thus, consequently, it will involve many features extraction to obtain precise condition diagnosis. However, large number of features extraction will increase the complexity of the diagnosis system. Therefore, in this paper, we presented a diagnosis method which is hybridization of adaptive genetic algorithms (AGAs), back propagation neural networks (BPNNs), and grey relational analysis (GRA) to diagnose the condition of multiple bearings system. AGAs are used in the diagnosis algorithm to determine the best initial weights of BPNNs in order to improve the diagnosis accuracy. In addition, GRA is applied to determine and select the dominant features from the vibration signal data which will provide good diagnosis of multiple bearings system in less features extraction. The experiments results show that AGAs-BPNNs with GRA approaches can increase the accuracy of diagnosis in shorter processing time, compared with the AGAs-BPNNs without the GRA. © 2014 Lili A.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are one of the most popular methods for classification in condition diagnosis of bearing systems. Regarding to ANNs performance, ANNs parameters have important role especially connectivity weights. In several running of learning processes with the same structure of ANNs, we can obtain different accuracy significantly since initial weights are selected randomly. Therefore, finding the best weights in learning process is an important task for obtaining good performance of ANNs. Previous researchers have proposed some methods to get the best weights such as simple average and majority voting. However, these methods have some limitations in providing the best weights especially in condition diagnosis of bearing systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid technique of multiple classifier-ANNs (mANNs) and adaptive probabilities in genetic algorithms (APGAs) to obtain the best weights of ANNs in order to increase the classification performance of ANNs in condition diagnosis of bearing systems. The mANNs are used to provide several best initial weights which are optimized by APGAs. The set optimized weights from APGAs, afterward, are used as the best weights for condition diagnosis. Our experiment shows mANNs-APGAs give better results than of the simple average and majority voting in condition diagnosis of bearing systems. This experiment also shows the distinction of maximum and minimum accuracy in mANNs-APGAs is lower than the two existing methods. © 2014, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

It is essential to detect bearing faults early to avoid unexpected breakdown of plant due to undetected faulty bearings. Many meta-heuristics techniques for condition diagnosis of single bearing systems have been developed. The techniques, however, are not effectively applicable for multiple bearing systems. In this paper, a new hybrid technique of genetic algorithms (GAs) with adaptive operator probabilities (AGAs) and back propagation neural networks (BPNNs), called AGAs–BPNNs, is proposed specifically for condition diagnosis of multiple bearing systems. In this technique, AGAs are integrated with BPNNs to attain better initial weights for the BPNNs and hence reduce their learning time. We tested the proposed technique on a two bearing systems, and used ten extracted features from the system’s vibration signals data as input and sixteen bearing condition classes as target output. The experimental results show that the AGAs–BPNNs technique obtains much higher classification accuracy in shorter CPU time and number of iterations compared with the standard BPNNs, and the hybrid of standard GAs and BPNNs. © 2014, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Adaptive operator probabilities; Back propagation neural networks; Condition diagnosis; Genetic algorithms; Multiple bearings","Algorithms; Backpropagation algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Maintenance; Neural networks; Probability; Adaptive operators; Back propagation neural networks; Bearing conditions; Classification accuracy; Genetic algorithm (GAs); Manufacturing industries; Multiple bearings; Number of iterations; Backpropagation",,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE",,"Harris, T.A., Kotzalas, M.N., (2007) Rolling bearing analysis: essential concepts of bearing technology, , Taylor and Francis Group, London:; Harnoy, A., (2003) Bearing design in machinery: engineering tribology and lubrication, , Marcel Dekker Inc., New York:; Rodriguez, P.V.J., Arkkio, A., Detection of stator winding fault in induction motor using fuzzy logic (2008) Appl Soft Comput, 8, pp. 1112-1120; Min, X., Fanrang, K., Fei, H., An approach for bearing fault diagnosis based on PCA and multiple classifier fusion.

The purpose of using ball bearing is to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads. Diagnosis of bearing vibration data is an important process to identify either the bearing is normal or defect. In this paper, we consider a single bearing system that consists of one normal or defect Fan End (FE) bearing in which an accelerometer is attached to both normal and defect FE bearing to capture the vibration data. These vibration data are grouped into several samples data. Five parameters are extracted from each sample to be used as the input in neural network model and class of target output is either normal or defect. Those five parameters are standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, absolute mean and root mean square. Our objectives are to find the dominant parameters and the best model for fault diagnosis of single bearing system. It is important to find the dominant parameters since the selection of dominant parameter can reduce the pre-processing data phase. According to our observation that the dominant parameter is either of standard deviation, absolute mean or root mean square and the best BPNN model is the model with one input neuron and one neuron in hidden layer. © February 2013 IJENS.","Back propagation neural network; Bearing system; Dominant parameters; Fault diagnosis",,,,,,,"Harnoy, A., Bearing Design in Machinery: Engineering Tribology and Lubrication (2003) Marcel Dekker Inc, pp. 224-226; Rodriguez, P.V.J., Arkkio, A., Detection of Stator Winding Fault in Introduction Motor Using Fuzzy Logic (2008) Applied Soft Computing 8, pp. 1112-1120; Wulandhari, L.A., Wibowo, A., Desa, M.I., Hybrid Neural Network-Genetic Algorithm for Fault Diagnosis of Bearing System (2011) Proceeding of Industrial Engineering and Service Science, pp. 1-6; Wang, H., Chen, P., Fault Diagnosis for A Rolling Bearing Used in A Reciprocating Machine by Adaptive Filtering Technique and Fuzzy Neural Network (2009) WSEAS TRANSACTION on SYSTEMS Issue, 7, pp. 1-6; Lei, Y., He, Z., Zi, Y., Application of An Intelligent Classification Method to Mechanical Fault Diagnosis (2009) Expert Systems with Applications 36, pp. 9941-9948; Huang, Y.C., Huang, C.M., Sun, H.C., Liao, L.S., Fault Diagnosis Using Hybrid Artificial Intelligent Methods (2010) 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications, pp. 41-44; Li, W., Shi, T., Liao, G., Yang, S., Feature Extraction and Classification of Gear Faults Using Principal Component Analysis (2003) Journal of Quality in Maintenance Engineering Vol. 9 No., 2, pp. 132-143; Patan, K., Artificial Neural Networks for the Modelling and Fault Diagnosis of Technical Process (2008) Springer, pp. 256-258; Hassoun, M.H., Fundamentals of Artificial Neural Networks, Asoke K.

This paper presents the mapping algorithm that covers one of the VCC cells, the Triangular VCC cell. The mapping algorithm consists of a cell-representation algorithm that represents a thinned binary image into triangular cells, and a transcribing algorithm that transcribes the cells into Vertex Chain Code. The algorithms have been tested and validated by using three thinned binary images: L-block, hexagon and pentagon. The results show that this algorithm is capable of visualizing and transcribing them into VCC; it can also be improved by testing on more thinned binary images. © 2012 ICST Institute for Computer Science, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Thinned Binary Image; Triangular Cells; Vertex Chain Code","Dimensional chain; Image representations; Mapping algorithms; Thinned binary image; Vertex chain codes; Algorithms; Binary images; Conformal mapping; Cytology; Data processing; Information technology; Pattern recognition; Signal processing; Transcription; Cells",,,,,,"Wulandhari, L.A., Haron, H., The evolution and trend of chain code scheme (2008) ICGST International Journal on Graphics, Vision and Image Processing (GVIP), 8 (3), pp. 17-23; Freeman, H., On the encoding of arbitrary geometric configurations (1961) IRE Trans., EC-10 (2), pp. 260-268; Freeman, H., Computer processing of line-drawing images (1974) ACM Computing Surveys, 6, pp. 57-97; Bribiesca, E., A new chain code (1999) Pattern Recognition, 32 (2), pp. 235-251; Deutsch, E.S., Thinning Algorithms on Rectangular, Hexagonal, and Triangular Arrays (1972) Communications of the ACM, 15 (9), pp. 827-837","Wulandhari, L.A.; Department of Modeling and Industrial Computing, , 81310 UTM Skudai, Johor Bahru, Malaysia; email: lili.wulandhari@gmail.com",,,,"1st Joint International Conference on Advances in Signal Processing and Information Technology, SPIT 2011 and the International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Processing and Computing, IPC 2011","1 December 2011 through 2 December 2011","Amsterdam",92418,18678211,9783642325724,,,"English","Lect.

However, curve tracing and its relative operations are the main bottleneck. Approach: This research presents the mapping algorithm that covers one of the vertex chain code cells, the rectangular-VCC cell. The mapping algorithm consists of a cell-representation algorithm that represents a thinned binary image in rectangular cells, a transcribing algorithm that transcribes the cells into vertex chain code and a validation algorithm that visualizes vertex chain code into rectangular cells. Results: The algorithms have been tested and validated by using three thinned binary images: L-block, hexagon and pentagon. Conclusion/Recommendations: The results show that this algorithm is capable of visualizing and transcribing them into vertex chain code. © 2011 Science Publications.","Clockwise direction; Freeman Chain Code (FCC); L-block hexagon; Mapping algorithm; Pentagon; Rectangular Cells; Thinned Binary Image; Transcribing algorithms; Validation algorithm; Vertex Chain Code (VCC)",,,,,,,"Abdullah, H., Lennie, A., Saifuddin, M.J., Ahmad, I., The effect of electrical properties by texturing surface on gaas solar cell efficiency (2009) Am.

Each code in this chain code indicates the number of cell vertices, which are in touch with the bounding contour of the shape in that element position. It is possible to represent shape in triangular, rectangular and hexagonal cells in vertex chain code. A shape that is used in vertex chain code that is proposed by Bribiesca is a shape without hole. This paper will explained vertex chain code in rectangular cell for shape with hole. Some characteristic of rectangular vertex chain code for shape with hole is presented by using some example of shapes. © 2009 IEEE.","Rectangular cell; Shapes with hole; Vertex chain code","Chain codes; Hexagonal cells; Image representations; Rectangular cell; Shapes with hole; Vertex chain code; Cell membranes; Information management; Codes (symbols)",,,,,,"Freeman, H., On The Encoding of Arbitrary Geometric Configurations (1961) IRE Trans, EC-10 (2), pp. 260-268; Bribiesca, E., New Chain Code, A., (1999) Pattern Recognition, 32 (2), pp. 235-251; McKee, J.W., Aggarwal, J.K., Computer Recognition ofPartial Views of Curved Objects (1977) IEEE Trans.

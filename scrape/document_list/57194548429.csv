The difference between this research application and others is the search feature based on an image. The search feature is designed to match the shape and orientation. This application uses a Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm to conduct the matching feature process. The SURF algorithm is divided into three main steps. The first step is to retrieve the image information and turn it into a matrix, using a Hessian - Laplace Technique to define the feature point following the integral to reduce the computational time. It also uses a Difference of Gaussian in order to handle the object with an invariant scale. This process is called Fast Hessian. The second step is to define the orientation of the image using a Haar Wavelet Responses Technique. The third step is to match the feature points from both images using a four dimensional vector and K-Means as a classification technique. The result of this research is an application which is able to collect plant information using image matching. © 2016 IEEE.","CBIR; encyclopedia; image matching; SURF","Information management; Web services; CBIR; Classification technique; Dimensional vectors; encyclopedia; Research applications; Speeded up robust features; SURF; Web-based applications; Image matching",,,,,"Connolly, T., Begg, C., Database systems: A practical approach to design, implementation, and management (6th edition) (2014) Pearson; Giri, A., Meena, Y.K., Review paper on content based image retrieval (2014) The International Journal of Science and Technoledge, pp. 125-129; Blanken, H., Vries, A., Blok, H., Feng, L., (2010) Multimedia Retrieval, , Amsterdam: Springer; Arthiabd, K., Vijayaraghavan, J., Content based image retrieval algorithm using colour models (2013) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 2 (3), pp. 1343-1347; Santos, L.F., Dias, R., Ribeiro, M., Traina, A., Combining diversity queries and visual mining to improve (2015) IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia, pp. 357-362; Meena, M., Ram Singh, A., Bharadi, A., Architecture for software as a service (saas) model of cbir on hybrid cloud of microsoft azure (2016) 7th International Conference on Communication, Computing and Virtualization 2016, pp. 569-578; Krajník, T., Cristóforis, P., Nitsche, M., Kusum, K., Image features and seasons revisited (2015) Mobile Robots (ECMR),2015 European Conference, pp. 1-7; Saad, M.H., Saleh, H., Konber, H., Ashour, M., CBIR system based on integration between surf and global features (2013) ICIT 2013 the 6th International Conference on Information Technology; Bay, H., Tuytelaars, T., Gool, L.C., SURF: Speeded up robust features (2008) Computer Vision and Image Understanding (CVIU), 110 (3), pp. 346-359; Guo, F., Luo, X., Liu, Y., Research on feature extraction and match method based on the surf algorithm for mobile augmented reality system (2015) International Industrial Informatics and Computer Engineering Conference, pp. 615-619; Schmitt, D., McCoy, N., (2011) Object Classification and Localization Using SURF Descriptors, , Citeseer; Lu, G., (1999) Multimedia Database Management Systems, , Norwood: Artech House",,,"BINUS Univerity;IEEE Indonesia Section;Wiley","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2016","16 November 2016 through 18 November 2016",,127842,,9781509033522,,,"English","Proc.

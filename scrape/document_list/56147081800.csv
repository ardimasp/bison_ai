It is believed that an online learning system can significantly improve the quality of education since it transcends time and space, a desirable trait in today's fast-paced and Internet-laden world. Nowadays, the 3D interface system used as a medium of online learning has further improved the 2D interface system. However, what kind of 3D interface system should be designed to increase students' interaction and engagement with the system? This paper details a 3D interface design that can meet the demands of interactivity and engagement for the system. By applying the Qualitative-Interactive approach, data were collected through literature study and interviews with several experienced practitioners in the field of online learning. Based on the results of data analysis, it was concluded that there were two key features that should be included in the 3D interface design, namely avatar and environment. The presence of both features is expected to increase students' interactivity and engagement within an online learning system. A prototype design was created to depict a more concrete picture on the benefits and the ease of 3D interface system usage, equipped with both avatar and environment features. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

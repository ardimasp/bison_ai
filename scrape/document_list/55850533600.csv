One of the big impacts is in organizational process especially in Human Resource Management (HRM). With the help of Information Technology, it changed the way of t raditional HR into modern HR. One of the most popular technology for HRM is Electronic Human Resource Management (E-HRM). E-HRM is an application of information technology that allows managers, applicants and employees access to human resource related information and services through the Internet. In this study we focused to discuss the success factor of E-HRM project implementation and the challenge of implementing E-HRM project. The successful E-HRM implementation can be achieved if there are a support from top management and many factors. However, there are still many challenges for implementing E-HRM. With this kind of factor and challenge, organization must know what to do before implementing the E-HRM system. © 2020, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

In this research the understanding of eco friendly is minimum power consumption. The devices that are selected have operationally low power consumption and normally have no power consumption as they are hibernating during idle state. To have the reliability a router of a router that has internal load balancing feature will provide the improvement of previous research on multi 3G services for broadband lines. Previous studies emphasized on accessing and downloading information files from Public Cloud residing Web Servers. The demand is not only for speed but high reliability of access as well. High reliability will mean mitigating both direct and indirect high cost due to repeated attempts of uploading and downloading the large files. Nomadic and mobile computer users need viable solution. Following solution for downloading information has been proposed and tested. The solution is promising. The result is now extended to providing reliable access line by means of redundancy and automatic reconfiguration for uploading and downloading large information files to a Web Server in the Cloud. The technique is taking advantage of internal load balancing feature to provision a redundant line acting as a backup line. A router that has the ability to provide load balancing to several WAN lines is chosen. The WAN lines are constructed using multiple 3G lines. The router supports the accessing Internet with more than one 3G access line which increases the reliability and availability of the Internet access as the second line immediately takes over if the first line is disturbed. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","3G Service; Power consumption; redundancy; reliability","Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power utilization; Environmental protection; Redundancy; Reliability; Telecommunication lines; Web services; 3G services; Automatic reconfiguration; High reliability; Information files; Low-power consumption; Mobile computers; Reliability and availability; Viable solutions; Electronic document exchange",,,,,,"Tanutama, L., Wijaya, R., Alexander, K., Wiratama, A., Indraswara, R., A Novel Broadband Line Construction Using 3G Service (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 19-26; Qiu, R.C., Zhu, W., Zhang, Y., Third-Generation and beyond (3.5G) Wireless Networks and Its Applications (2002) IEEE International Symposium Circuits and Systems, ISCAS, 1, pp. 41-44; El Al Ahmed, A., Saadawi, T., Lee, M., A transport layer load sharing mechanism for mobile wireless hosts (2004) Proceedings of the Second IEEE Annual Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops, pp. 87-91; Brassil, J., An empirical study of bonded heterogeneous WAN access links (2005) The 14th IEEE Workshop on Local and Metropolitan Area Networks; Brassil, J., Improving VPN performance over multiple access links (2008) 5th International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems, pp. 649-656; Kokku, R., Bohra, A., Ganguly, S., Venkataramani, A., A Multipath Background Network Architecture INFOCOM 2007. 26th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications, pp. 1352-1360; Lane, J.R., Nakao, A., Best-Effort Network Layer Packet Reordering in Support of Multipath Overlay Packet Dispersion (2008) IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, pp. 1-6; Sam, S., (2005) Big Iron Lessons, Part 2: Reliability and Availability: What's the Difference?, , Mar PDF; Kuo, W., Wan, R., Recent advances in optimal reliability allocation (2007) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics-Part A: Systems and Humans, 37 (2), pp. 143-156; Parikh, P.P., Kanabar, M.G., Sidhu, T.S., (2010) Power and Energy Society General Meeting, 2010 IEEE, pp. 1-7. , (IEEE) Opportunities and challenges of wireless communication technologies for smart grid applications July; Coit, D.W., Maximization of system reliability with a choice of redundancy strategies (2003) IIE Transactions, 35 (6), pp. 535-543","Tanutama, L.; Computer Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: lukast12@binus.edu","Kasih T.P.","","Institute of Physics Publishing","International Conference on Eco Engineering Development 2017, ICEED 2017","14 November 2017 through 15 November 2017",,133427,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Mobility is increasingly demanded along with broadband. Certain to locations do not have the necessary infrastructure for broadband. Users that are residing in fixed locations will be able to access broadband service. They could access high-speed access line and enjoy for broadband services offered by service providers. The operators provide both conventional copper cables and fiber optic cables as access lines. Sometimes it is not possible for users that are nomadic or mobile to obtain broadband access line. Quite often small and medium-sized companies need to have an alternative solution to access broadband lines that are economic and technically simple. In the mean time, cellular service providers offer 3G Internet services with nationwide coverage to access the Internet. 3G service has reasonably high transmission speed. We had performed a similar research but changes in the platform and algorithm in the router challenged us to ensure sustainability of the concept. This research still develops an application that uses multi 3G services to provide broadband access. The solution that is being developed should sustain its economic nature and simplicity. Using available multiple 3G connections, a user can access large files of information through virtual high speed channel anytime and any where. A technique of paralleling multiple lower speed channels to obtain a virtual high-speed channel is called inverse multiplexing. To simplify the technique a router that has the ability to provide load balancing to several WAN lines is chosen. The inverse multiplexing concept through a number of channels with 3G services can run well for downloading files from a Web Server as shown by laboratory experiments and field measurements. © 2016 IEEE.","3G; Inverse Multiplexing; Load balancing","Cables; Internet service providers; Multiplexing; Multiplexing equipment; Resource allocation; Speed; Technical presentations; Telecommunication lines; Web services; Alternative solutions; High transmission; High-speed access lines; High-speed channels; Information contents; Inverse multiplexing; Laboratory experiments; Small and medium-sized companies; Electronic document exchange",,,,,,"Tanutama, L., Wijaya, R., Alexander, K., Wiratama, A., Indraswara, R., A novel broadband line construction using 3g service (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 19-26; Qiu, R.C., Zhu, W., Zhang, Y., Third-generation and beyond (3.5g) wireless networks and its Applications (2002) IEEE International Symposium.

If the location is static the needs can be addressed easily. There are high-speed transmission or broadband services offered by a large number of operators through both conventional and fiber optic cables. If the users are moving nomadically or are mobile, then obtaining large-capacity transmission systems is not simple. For some purposes, especially for small and medium-sized companies, they need to have alternative solutions that are economic and technically feasible. Cellular service providers offer 3G Internet services with wide coverage. This study develops an application using 3G services to provide broadband access that is economic and relatively simple. This solution uses multiple 3G connection to transmit information at high speed as if there is broadband channel capacity. Information on a Web Server can be downloaded by the parties concerned. The information retrieval can obtain the necessary capacity using multiple 3G connections. The technique of bundling multiple lower speed channels to obtain high-speed channel is called inverse multiplexing. In this research, the technique is simplified by using a router that has the ability to provide load balancing. This research was carried out by conducting laboratory experiments and field measurements. The experimental results show that the concept of inverse multiplexing through a number of channels with 3G services can run well for downloading files. © 2015 The Authors.

Since 2010, there have been many complaints on network performance such as slow connections or frequent break up of connections. Although the configuration and network capacity has been regularly fixed and upgraded, the complaints keep on repeating. The current study is formulated by using multiple case methodologies such as data retrieval by using SNMP polling tools, Access Point (AP) Monitoring, Syslog, and field measurements. It is noted that the distance factor, the number of users and signal strength do not influence the speed with an average of 4,769 Kbps for download and 874 Kbps for upload. However the roaming activity occurring in WLAN is equal to 30% of 10,418 roaming events, which in turn lead to the slow speed of the connections. © 2013 IIJ.","Access point monitoring; Network analyzer; Snmp polling; Syslog; Wireless traffic",,,,,,,"Lockwood, J.W., ""Implementation of Campus-Wide Wireless Network Services Using ATM, virtual LANs, and Wireless Basestation"" (1999) Proceeding of IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC 1999), 2, pp. 603-605; Hills, A., Wireless Andrew [mobile computing for university campus]"" (1999) IEEE Spectrum, 36 (6), pp. 49-53; Zhiwen, Y., Yunji, L., Bukan, X., Yue, Y., Bin, G., ""Towards a Smart Campus with Mobile Social Networking"" (2011), pp. 162-169. , Proceeding of International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings/CPSCom) and 4th International Conference on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing; Papadopouli, M., Haipeng, S., Raftopoulos, E., Ploumidis, M., Hernandez-Campus, F., ""Short-Term Forecasting in a Campus-Wide Wireless Network"" (2005) Proceeding of IEEE 16th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC 2005), 3, pp. 1446-1452; Schwab, D., Bunt, R., ""Characterising the Use of a Campus Wireless Network"" (2004) Proceeding of 23rd Annual/Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies (INFOCOM 2004), 2, pp. 862-870; Kortz, D., Essien, K., ""Analysis of a Campus-Wide Wireless Network"" (2005) J.

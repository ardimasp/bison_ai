The SMEs here have their own unique characteristics. The government had set up Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to improve SME’s business process and to share knowledge. However, implementing a successful ERP comes with its own challenges. This research investigated the factors that led to a successful ERP implementation. Using case studies, in-depth interview and observation at Trinity Era Aplikasindo, one of SAP representatives in Indonesia, as well as literature review, this study found factors such as Top Management support, good change management, and training have a significant impact on a successful ERP implementation in SME. This article discusses a comprehensive approach to understanding how ERP contributes to the success of SMEs. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Business improvement; Critical success factor; Enterprise resource planning; Sharing of knowledge; SMEs",,,,,,"Ayyagari, M., Beck, T., Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Small and medium enterprises across the globe (2007) Small Business Economics, 29, pp. 415-434; Bernard, H.R., Ryan, G.W., (2010) Analyzing Qualitative Data: Systematic Approaches, , Los Angeles, CA: Sage; Bernroider, E., Mitlöhner, J., Characteristics of the multiple attribute decision making methodology in enterprise resource planning software decisions (2005) Communications of the International Information Management Association (CIIMA), 5 (1), pp. 49-58; Dantes, G.R., Hasibuan, Z.A., The impact of enterprise resource planning (ERP) system implementation on organization: Case study ERP implementation in Indonesia (2011) IBIMA Business Review, 2011, pp. 1-10; Deep, A., Guttridge, P., Dani, S., Burns, N., Investigating factors affecting ERP selection in made to order SME sector (2008) Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, 19 (4), pp. 430-446; Dezdar, S., Ainin, S., The influence of organizational factors on successful ERP implementation (2011) Management Decision, 49 (6), pp. 911-926; Egan, R.W., Fjermestad, J., Change and resistance help for practitioner of change (2005) Proceedings of the 38 th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 219-226; Fan, J.C., Fang, K., ERP implementation and inform ationsystems success: A test of DeLone and McLean’s model (2006) Technology Management for the Global Future, 2006.

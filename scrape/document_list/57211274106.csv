The development of knowledge makes it easier for farmers to improve farming skills, so potatoes are not only found in the Dieng Wonosobo area, but are starting to be planted in various regions in Indonesia, one of which is Tawangmangu. Dieng and Tawangmangu areas are the same in the province of Central Java. Often the obstacles experienced by farmers to date are the marketing of potatoes at a selling price that benefits farmers. This research was conducted to compare marketing sales of potatoes in the Dieng and Tawangmangu mountains. The scope of the research object is in accordance with the problems to be studied, namely the marketing of potato products, with a research unit of potato farmers in the Dieng mountains and Tawangmangu, Central Java. This research is a qualitative descriptive study. The results of the research are the marketing design of the Dieng and Tawangmangu mountain ranges. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Dieng Wonosobo; Farmers; Marketing; Potatoes; Tawangmangu","Electronic commerce; Landforms; Marketing; Sales; Descriptive studies; Dieng Wonosobo; Farmers; Marketing designs; Mountain ranges; Potatoes; Research object; Tawangmangu; Agriculture",,,,"Binus University","This paper can be tangible because many authors are assisted by Bina Nusantara University, especially to Prof. Tirta Nugraha Mursitama, Vice Chancellor of Research and Technology Transfer at Bina Nusantara University, which has facilitated our research.","(2014) World Bank and Environment in Indonesia, , https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/indonesia/brief/world-bank-and-environment-in-indonesia, worldbank, Online.

The study was conducted by field observations and interviews with 30 potato farmers in Tawangmangu, Central Java. There are two common supply chains, namely supply chains without company intervention and supply chains with a mix of corporate hands. This study chooses supply chain design ranging from purchasing seed farmers, buying, to selling. Supply chains are interconnected and have different interests. The application of supply chains without company intervention is still considered ineffective and inefficient for farmers. Future research can improve this research with more detailed cost details. This research provides an understanding of suppliers and retailers who lack understanding and understanding. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Farmers; Potatoes; SCM; Supply chain; Tawangmangu","Electronic commerce; Sales; Seed; Farmers; Field observations; Indonesia; Potato products; Potatoes; Supply chain design; Tawangmangu; Supply chains",,,,"Binus University

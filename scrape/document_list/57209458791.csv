A solution for this problem is to encourage more women to participate within economic sectors by creating regulations that support them. Currently, women are faced with numerous issues that hinder their ability to maintain both work and domestic duties; these issues include long working hours, short maternity leave, and limited children day cares. As a result, the Japanese government has issued several policies to resolve such problems. One solution is by introducing a new working system called the teleworking system. The teleworking system enables people to work outside of the office by using ICT. Research surrounding this system describes and analyzes data involving women participation in the economic sector. The data is collected through interviews with respondents in Tokyo. The approach of this research adopts quantitative and qualitative observations through its analytical and comparative descriptive method. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Physics; Economic productivity; Economic sectors; Qualitative observations; Teleworking; Working hours; Working systems; Telecommuting",,,,,"Author gratefully acknowledged financial support in form of grant (Hibah Penelitian Produk Terapan) from Minister of Research and Higher Education (Menristekdikti)","Avery, E.C., Nelson, R.M., (2014) ""womenomics"" in Japan: In Brief Congressional Research Service; Davies, R., Ikeno, O., (2002) The Japanese Mind, , (Tokyo: Tuttle Publishing); Undp, (2016) Human Development Report 2016: Human Development for Everyone, , (New York, NY: the United Nations Development Programme); Pemberdayaan Perempuan, K., Anak, P., (2016) Pembangunan Manusia Berbasis Gender 2016; Macnaughtan, H., Womenomics for Japan: Is the Abe policy for gendered employment viable in an era of precarity?

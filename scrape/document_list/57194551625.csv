This activity takes time and effort. To make it easier, android application is developed to optimize the process. Chat feature and push notification are important features of the application to enable users to get additional and up-to-date information from management. However, until this day, there is no mobile application for room/house rental which incorporates built-in chatting and the push notification features. The purpose of this study is to develop a mobile application incorporating chat and push notification feature to provide information about boarding houses and evaluate it. Features developed in this application are login, view boarding rooms list, view detail, review, view map, chat, and broadcast information. An evaluation shows that the application is useful to provide boarding house information and to communicate between room seekers and building managers. © 2016 IEEE.","boarding house information; chat; mobile application; push notification","Houses; Information management; Managers; Mobile computing; Android applications; boarding house information; Building managers; chat; Important features; Mobile applications; push notification; Mobile telecommunication systems",,,,,"Bosomworth, D., (2016) Mobile Marketing Statistics Compilation, , http//www.smartinsights.com/mobilemarketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics, [Accessed: 11-Apr-2016]; (2016) INFOKOST Sewa Kamar Harian-Apl Android di Google Play, , https//play.google.com/store/apps/detailsid=net.infokost.infokostapp, Mediapura Digital Indonesia,rftxt [Accessed: 11-Apr-2016]; Hilarius, I., (2016) KosKost-Sewa Kosan, Kamar-Apl Android di Google Play, , https//play.google.com/store/apps/detailsid=com.kloudasia.kostuser, [Accessed: 11-Apr-2016]; (2016) Mamikos-Cari Kost Gampang & Akurat, , http//mamikos.com, GIT Mobile,rftxt [Accessed: 11-Apr-2016]; Hamad, H., Saad, M., Abed, R., Performance evaluation of restful web services for mobile devices (2010) International Arab Journal of E-Technology, , http//www.iajet.org/iajet_files/vol.1/no.3/PerformanceEvaluationofRESTfulWebServicesforMobileDevices.pdf, [Accessed: 09-Apr-2016]; Moffit, J., (2010) Professional XMPP Programming with JavaScript and JQuery, , Indianapolis: Wrox; Saint-Adre, P., Smith, K., Trocon, R., XMPP: The definitive guide: Building real-time applications with jabber technologies (2009) Sebastopol: O' Reilly Media; Warren, I., Meads, A., Srirama, S., Weerasinghe, T., Paniagua, C., Push notification mechanisms for pervasive smartphone applications (2014) IEEE Pervasive Comput, 13 (2), pp. 61-71; Device Group Messaging, , https//developers.google.com/cloudmessaging/notifications#managing_device_groups, Google,[Accessed: 09-Apr-2016]; Coupal, D., Toews, J.D., Systems and methods for displaying current prices, including hotel room rental rates With Markers Simultaneously on A Map, , 17-Jul-2008; National car rental increases efficiency for business travellers with new mobile app (2013) General Interest Periodicals-Canada, Business and Economics, , Marketwire; Ciaramella, A., Cimino, M.G.C., Lazzerini, B., Marcelloni, F., Situation-aware mobile service recommendation with fuzzy logic and semantic web (2009) 9th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications, pp. 1037-1042; Mobile devices; Genesys redefines the mobile customer experience by linking mobile apps with customer service agents (2012) Investment Weekly News, , http//e-resources.perpusnas.go.id/library.phpid=00001, Investment Weekly News,[Accessed: 11-Apr-2016]; Shneiderman, B., Plaisant, C., Jacobs, S., (2009) Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction, , 5th ed.

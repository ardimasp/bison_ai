It used the quantitative method with 160 students as the research subjects with the data collection technique of questionnaire distribution. The questionnaires are valid (the corrected item total correlations for knowledge, attitudes and behavior are: 0.745, 0.878 and 0.726) and reliable (α for knowledge, attitudes and behavior are: 0.985, 0.978 and 0.959). The positive nuances questionnaire's results are analyzed through a correlative analysis. The results showed scale 4 were chosen most for knowledge and attitude (41.40% and 42.93%), only in behavior the scale 3 was the most chosen (34.63%). The results concluded that the students tend to have positive knowledge, attitude and behavior towards the sustainable development, and the results will give strong support the sustainable future for human security. The results were connected with the big data, especially in social media and instant messaging where they can learn and get educated about sustainable development. © 2020 ACM.","attitude; behavior; big data; instant messaging; Knowledge; social media; sustainable development","Planning; Students; Surveys; Sustainable development; Correlative analysis; Data collection; Higher education; Human securities; Instant messaging; Quantitative method; Research subjects; Social media; Big data",,,,"Binus University","The study is supported by BINUS University Grant.","Rosen, M.A., The future of sustainable development (2017) Welcome to the European Journal of Sustainable Development Research.

Therefore, the author tries to explain a method for teaching mathematics (especially for elementary school students), to be easily understood by students. As a result, mathematics is no longer perceived hard. One good method of learning mathematics is the use of models (bar modeling). The author conducted research by providing two different treatments, without bar modeling and with bar modeling, to the elementary school students. The result showed that the use of bar modeling has increased students’ scores significantly. Bar modeling is not the only method of teaching at the elementary level, and it is easier for elementary school students in learning mathematical concepts of symbolization in problem solving. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.","Bar modeling; Elementary level; Mathematics",,,,,,,"Abdurrahman, M., (1999) Pendidikan Bagi Anak berkesulitan Belajar, , Penerbit Rineka Cipta, Jakarta; Dick, W., Carey, L., Carey, J.O., (2005) The Systematic Design of Instruction, , Pearson, Boston; Eric, C.C., (2009) Journal of Science and Mathematics, p. 36; FitzSimmons, J.A., http://plato.wilmington.edu:http://plato.wilmington.edu/faculty/jfitzs/tchg_phi.htm, plato.wilmington.edu., Retrieved April 1, 2010; Gredler, M.E., (2001) Learning and Instruction: Theory Into Practice, , 4th edn., Merrill Prentice Hall, Ohio; Hadi, S., Mathematics Education Reform Movement In Indonesia (2012) 12th International Congress on Mathematical Education, , COEX, Seoul, Korea; Hardiman, F.B., (2007) Filsafat Modern, , Gramedia, Jakarta; Smith, P.L., Ragan, T.J., (1993) Instructional Design, , Merill, New York; Wyatt, W., http://arapaho.nsuok.edu:http://arapaho.nsuok.edu/∼wyattw/webfiles/philosophy.html, arapaho.nsuok.edu., Retrieved April 1, 2010","Willyarto, M.N.; Bina Nusantara UniversityIndonesia",,,"American Scientific Publishers",,,,,19366612,,,,"English","Adv.

At Bina Nusantara University of Jakarta there is a self development education to develop the personality of students in their mind, body, soul and heart. Through this course namely character building (self development series), students arranged to know their selves well and holistically. This research wants to know how the impact of self development education on the students, especially in self esteem aspect. This study is using quantitative method. The results of field research on 336 students showed a negative correlation between Self-Esteem and Self-Knowledge (correlation = −0.257, P = 0,00, P < 0, 05). That is, the higher the self-esteem of students, the lower the knowledge about themselves. Self development education has no correlation to the self esteem of Bina Nusantara University Students.

This research was based on the quantitative approach and Baker’s theory on Smartphone usage (2005). Data collection was conducted by distributing questionnaires. The questionnaires were constructed by the researchers based on the theory of Baker (2005), involving 200 students of BINUS University. Data analysis was performed by Pearson correlation analysis. The results of this study are there is a positive correlation between portability and motivation (r = 0.335, p < 0.01), a positive correlation between collaboration and motivation (r = 0.342, p < 0.01). There is no correlation between age and motivation either no correlation between GPA and motivation (r = − 0.067, p > 0.05).

This research hypothesized that the relationship between the variables is mediated by online identity management strategy in the form of social competition. This research employed questionnaire to gain variables data. Participants of this research were 214 undergraduate students of Bina Nusantara University, Jakarta (106 males, 108 females).

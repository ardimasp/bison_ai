Precisely, both aspects relate to the Shortage Mispacking Quality Report (SMQR) Claims in Export and Import in Automotive Industry. This paper discusses the major aspects of Innovation, Information Technology, Performance and Competitive Advantage. Furthermore, In the empirical study of PT. Astra Honda Motor (AHM) refers to SMQR Claims, Communication Systems, Analysis and Design Systems. Briefly both aspects of the major aspects and its empirical study are discussed in the Introduction Session. Furthermore, the more detail discussion is conducted in the related aspects in other sessions of this paper, in particular in Literature Review in term classical and updated reference of current research. The increases of SMQR claim and communication problem at PT. Astra Daihatsu Motor (PT. ADM) which still using the email cause the time of claim settlement become longer and finally it causes the rejected of SMQR claim by supplier. With presence of this problem then performed to design the integrated communication system to manage the communication process of SMQR claim between PT. ADM with supplier. The systems was analyzed and designed is expected to facilitate the claim communication process so that can be run in accordance with the procedure and fulfill the target of claim settlement time and also eliminate the difficulties and problems on the previous manual communication system with the email. The design process of the system using the approach of system development life cycle method by Kendall & Kendall (2006)which design process covers the SMQR problem communication process, judgment process by the supplier, claim process, claim payment process and claim monitoring process. After getting the appropriate system designs for managing the SMQR claim, furthermore performed the system implementation and can be seen the improvement in claim communication process and settlement time become faster and achieve the target. The conclusion in this paper comprises two major aspects. The first one refers to the conclusion in term of theory and concept. The second one refers to the conclusion in term of the empirical study of one of automotive industries in Indonesia. Both of them are expected to have contribution in current and future research of related aspects that are discussed in this paper. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.","Analysis and Design Systems; Communication Systems; Information Technology; Innovation; SMQR Claim",,,,,,"Almajali, D.A., Dahalin, M.Z., (2011) Factors Influencing IT-Business Strategic Alignment and Sustainable Competitive Advantage: A Structural Equation Modelling Approach, , IBIMA Publishing; Benner, M.J., Tushman, M.L., Process management and technological innovation: A longitudinal study of the photography and paint industries (2002) Administration Science Quarterly, 47, pp. 676-706; Benner, M.J., Tushman, M.L., Exploitation, exploration, and process management: The productivity dilemma revisited (2003) Academy of Management Review, 28, pp. 238-256; Blanchard, B.S., Fabrycky, W.J., (2011) Systems Engineering and Analysis, , United States of America: Pearson; Damanpour, F., Organizational complexity and innovation: Developing and testing multiple contingency models (1996) Management Science, 42 (5), pp. 693-716; Danneels, E., The dynamics of product innovation and firm competences (2002) Strategic Management Journal, 23, pp. 1095-1121; De Meo, E., Industria alimentare e sistema innovativo in Puglia (2004) Politica Agricola Internazionale, pp. 1-2; Gaspersz, V., Fontana, A., (2011) Malcolm Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence, , Bogor: Vinchristo Publication; Howard, M., Collaboration and the '3DayCar': A study of automotive ICT adoption (2005) Journal of Information Technology, 20, pp. 245-258; (2005) Statistiche sulla Ricerca Scientifica, , Istat, Istat, Roma; Jansen, J.J.P., Van Den Bosch, F.A.J., Volberda, H.W., Exploratory innovation, exploitative innovation, and performance: Effects of organizational antecedents and environmental moderators (2006) Management Science, 52 (11), pp. 1661-1674; Kendall, K.E., Kendall, J.E., (2006) Analisis Dan Perancangan Sistem, , Jakarta: Indeks; Lerici, C.R., L'innovazione nella moderna tecnologia alimentare (1996) Atti v Convegno Nazionale ANDID, , Positive Press Verona, Rimini; Levinthal, D.A., March, J.G., The myopia of learning (1993) Strategic Management Journal, 14, pp. 95-112; Lewin, A.Y., Long, C.P., Caroll, T.N., The coevolution of new organizational forms (1999) Organization Science, 10, pp. 535-550; Li, Y., Zhou, N., Si, Y., Exploratory innovation, exploitative innovation, and performance: Influence of business strategies and environment (2010) Nankai Business Review International, 1 (3), pp. 297-316; March, J.G., Exploration and exploitation in organizational learning (1991) Organization Science, 2, pp. 71-87; McGrath, R.M., (2013) The End of Competitive Advantage.

Meanwhile, DKI Jakarta as the capital city of Indonesia has a total of 325 private higher education institutions. Green IT term is quiet well known in these areas, although its implementation is still sporadic. However, information technology (IT) gives fully support toward the learning process at the campus area. As its project scope, this research was focused in DKI Jakarta, but it is applicable for others. Many research on green IT or green computing have been conducted, however none of them focusing on Private Higher Education Institutions in Indonesia. Based on the previous research done by various Private Higher Education Institutions,IBM and Green Computing Methodology by GTYS, the Green IT Governance Model for Private Higher Education Institutions in DKI Jakarta area was developed. However, further researches are expected in order to develop the best practice. Furthermore, energy saving, waste management systems and information technology will be controlled accordingly and the threat of toxins that can harm our health can be avoided. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

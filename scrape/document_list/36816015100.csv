Those documents exist not only in a paper based but also in an electronic based. It can be seen from the data sample taken by the SpringerLink publisher in 2010, which showed an increase in the number of digital document collections from 2003 to mid of 2010. Then, how to manage them well becomes an important need. This paper describes a new method in managing documents called as inverted files system. Related with the electronic based document, the inverted files system will closely used in term of its usage to document so that it can be searched over the Internet using the Search Engine. It can improve document search mechanism and document save mechanism. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,"Moore, W., Maccreery, N., Marlow, M., (2010) Usage Measurements for Digital Content, , SpringerLink; Baeza-Yates, R., Ribeiro-Neto, B., (1999) Modern Information Retrieval, , Addison Wesley, USA; Neve, G., Orio, N., (2004) Indexing and Retrieval of Music Documents Through Pattern Analysis and Data Fusion Techniques, , Universitat Pompeu Fabra; Liddy, E., (2005) Document Retrieval, Automatic, Encyclopedia of Language & Linguistics; Lu, G., (1999) Multimedia Management Database Systems, , Artech House Inc., Boston, London; Carmel, D., Cohen, D., Fagin, R., Frachi, E., Herscovici, M., Maarek, Y.S., Soffer, A., Static index pruning for information retrieval systems (2001) Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 43-50. , New Orleans, LA; Garcia, S., Williams, H.E., Cannane, A., Estivill-Castro, V., Access-ordered indexes (2004) Proceedings of the Australasian Computer Science Conference, pp. 7-14. , Dunedin, New Zealand., Ed.

To measure the quality of software design, software metrics are used. Unfortunately in software development practice, there are a lot of software developers who are not concerned with the component's quality and characteristic. Software metrics does not interest them, because to understand the measurement of the metrics, a deep understanding about degree, dimension, and capacity of some attribute of the software product is needed. This event triggers them to build software's whose quality is below the standard. What is more dangerous is that these developers are not aware of quality and do not care with their work product. Of course these occurrences is concerning and a solution needed to be found. Through this paper the researcher is trying to formulate an indicator of component software that shows component design quality and characteristic visually. This indicator can help software developers to make design decision and refactoring decision, detect the design problem more quickly, able to decide which area to apply refactoring, and enable us to do early or final detection of design defects. © 2010 IEEE.","Detection of design defects; Indicator component software; Refactoring; Software component characteristic; Software component design quality","Computer software; Defects; Product design; Component software; Design defects; High-quality products; Quality of softwares; Refactorings; Software component; Software developer; Software development practices; Software design",,,,,"Kaur, K., Singh, H., Evaluating an Evolving Software Component: Case of Internal Design (2009) ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes, 34 (4). , July; Chahal, K.K., Singh, H., Metrics to Study Symptoms of Bad Software Designs (2009) ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes, 34 (1). , January; Konstantinos, S., Spinellis, D., Refactoring - Does it improve software quality?

The sample of the study is daily stock prices in the KOMPAS 100 Index covering the first quarter of 2013 up to second quarter 2016. Data regression analysis suggests that a stock’s illiquidity is not a price factor in the Indonesian market even after controlling three factors from Fama and French. Concentrated ownership of a firm by the founder and his or her family might lead to thin liquidity in the market because owners tend to hold their stocks; thus, there is only limited stocks for transactions in the market. As expected, market risk and size premium have a positive effect on excess stock returns; however, considering other factors based on Fama and French, the value premium factor is not significantly linked to capital asset pricing. Lagged return is a variable and an important factor for consideration before making an investment. Additionally, a positive relationship between inflation and excess returns implies that the Indonesian capital market has provided a hedge against inflation. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Corwin and Schultz model;

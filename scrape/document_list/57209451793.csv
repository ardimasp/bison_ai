This paper will begin with brief explanation about how the brain processes the information and the history of Infographic that has become part of the visual communication design heritage. Then will be discussed how infographic both on printed and digital media convey comprehensive information that related to the human information - processing system. At the end of the article can be obtained a clearer picture on how infographic with its visual approach makes impacts to the reader, in order to understand complex information. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bionics; Digital storage; Visual communication; Brain process; Complex information; Comprehensive information; Human information processing; Infographic; Presenting informations; Visual communication designs; Partial discharges",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

The goal is to parse the intent of complex text lessons into more effective and understandable forms. The use of thinking map is specifically the tree map, bubble map, flow map and brace map which is then also applied the design principle, which uses character illustration and place focused on simple outline, hierarchy of information by using typography and line and shape as navigation map thinking in one edugraphic. The results show a communication creation that the content is more simple than long text because the intent of the content of knowledge has been conveyed through the thinking map and design principles. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Design Principles; Effective media; Elementary schools; Navigation map; Tree-maps; Physics",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

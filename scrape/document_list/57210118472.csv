Moreover, the current rapid development of mobile technology multiplies the efforts to test software in varying mobile devices. This challenge drives many researchers to implement automated testing that would increase efficiency of resource usage. The first stage of automated testing is to generate and optimize test cases automatically. Test case could be generated from requirement artifacts such as UML diagram to provide test case on early phase of software development process. There are two approaches to optimize the generated test case, by using mathematical or computational approach. This research aims to implement test case generation from combinational UML diagram and optimize the test case by using genetic algorithm. Simple example of login case is provided to simulate the proposed method. The experimental result of this paper proved that genetic algorithm implementation is able to optimize generated test paths by showing the fitness value. © 2019, ICIC International.

Some of social media web applications, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, even provide user with an easy information sharing features. However, the information is presented in the form of a timeline or a feed, which is sometimes not relevant to the user or quite hard to accessed by user because of the redundancy of the information. This situation can be resolved with a Web Scraping method proposed in this paper, that able to search information, combine and present it in a better way according to user preferences. A system is developed to implement the proposed method by using an API that Facebook Developers and Twitter Developers provided. In addition, regular expression (or Regex) which is a language construction that can be used for matching text by using some patterns. Based on experiment conducted in this research, overload information could be suppressed into structure data that store in a database, less redundancy information is presented, and information relevancy could be adjusted to user preferences. © 2019 The Authors.

Game development that grows rapidly makes the desire to incorporate educational elements into the game application. It is also supported by the development of game engine to facilitate game development. The purpose of this research is to build an education based game on PC platform using Unity3D Game Engine (the newest game engine) to increase the learning frequency. The result achieved in this result is the creation of an educational based game app as a medium of study by combining the concept of the game and learning in it.

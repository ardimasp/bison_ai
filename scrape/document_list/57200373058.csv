Cables are used in a variety of structures that employ their unique characteristics to create efficient design tension members. The condition of the cable forces in the cable supported structure is an important indication of judging whether the structure is in good condition. Several methods have been developed to measure on site cable forces. Vibration technique using correlation between natural frequency and cable forces is a simple method to determine in situ cable forces, however the method need accurate information on the boundary condition, cable mass, and cable length. The natural frequency of the cable is determined using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) Technique to the acceleration record of the cable. Based on the natural frequency obtained, the cable forces then can be determine by analytical or by finite element program. This research is focus on the vibration techniques to determine the cable forces, to understand the physical parameter effect of the cable and also modelling techniques to the natural frequency and cable forces. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","cable forces; FFT Technique; natural frequency; vibration","Fast Fourier transforms; Natural frequencies; Cable forces; Cable-supported structure; FFT (fast Fourier transform); FFT techniques; Finite element programs; Modelling techniques; vibration; Vibration techniques; Cables",,,,,"Casas, J.R., A combined method for measuring cable forces: The cable-stayed Alamillo Bridge, Spain, Structural Enginering International (1994) Journal of the IABSE, 4, pp. 235-240. , November; Debora, S.N., Parivallal, S., Ravisankar, K., Hemalatha, G., Evaluation of Cable Tension Using Vibration Based Methodologies for Health Monitoring of Structures (2015) IJIRSET, 4; Chang, S.-P., Nonlinear Dynamic Analysis of Spatial Suspended Elasti Catenary Cable with Finite Element Method (2008) KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering, 12 (2), pp. 121-128; Alice, E., (2006), Measurement and Evaluation of Cable Forces in the Alvsborg Bridge (Stockholm: Royal Institute of Technology) Master Thesis; Erwin, K., (2006) Advanced Engineering Mathematic, , 9 (Hoboken: Wiley); Steiveman, D.B., (1953), (New York: Wiley amp; Sons Inc) A Practical Treatise on Suspension Bridges; Walther, R., (1988) Cable Stayed Bridges, , (London: L Thomas Telford Ltd) William Crozier, Penerjemah; Hiroki, Y., (1992), (Thailand: Asian Institute of Technology) Structural Dynamics; Rastandi Josia, I., (University of Indonesia) Presentation Material - Presentasi Jembatan Siak III by Dr. Ing","Suangga, M.; Civil Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: suangga@binus.edu","Kasih T.P.","","Institute of Physics Publishing","International Conference on Eco Engineering Development 2017, ICEED 2017","14 November 2017 through 15 November 2017",,133427,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

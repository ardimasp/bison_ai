The goal of this research is to develop a light-weight algorithm to recognize a pair of road lane markers using computer vision and to estimate the vehicle position relative to the lane markers. The road lane recognition algorithm uses inverse perspective mapping of detected lines to speed-up recognition of the lane markers pair, and then a color matching stage is employed to reduce false recognition. The algorithm is implemented in a small battery-powered processing unit and evaluated in a miniature four-wheel vehicle to recognize a pair of lane markers on the floor and to estimate the vehicle's pose on the floor relative to the lane markers. The algorithm managed to estimate the lateral position and the orientation of the vehicle with accuracy about 1.5 cm and 2 degree respectively, and an estimation rate of 2.7 Hz. © 2013 IEEE.","Inverse perspective mapping; lane recognition; real-time system; vehicle pose estimation","Artificial intelligence; Electric vehicles; Floors; Mapping; Real time systems; Roads and streets; Inverse perspective mappings; Lane recognition; Lateral positions; Position estimation; Processing power; Road lane recognition; Vehicle pose; Vehicle position; Algorithms",,,,,"Caner Kurtul, M., (2010) Road Lane and Traffic Sign Detection & Tracking for Autonomous Urban Driving, , Bogazici University, Istanbul, Master Thesis; Zhou, S., A novel lane detection based on geometrical model and gabor filter (2010) IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium, pp. 59-64. , San Diego, CA; Xu, F., Wang, B., Zhou, Z., Zheng, Z., Realtime lane detection for intelligent vehicles based on monocular vision (2012) 31st Chinese Control Conference, pp. 7332-7337. , Hefei; Abdulhakam, A.M.A., Khalifa, O.O., Rafiqul Islam, M., Khan, S., Real time lane detection for autonomous vehicles (2008) International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering, pp. 82-88. , Kuala Lumpur; Kuang, P., Zhu, Q., Liu, G., Real-time road lane recognition using fuzzy reasoning for AGV vision system (2004) International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems, 2, pp. 989-993. , June; Coşkun, F., Tunçer, O., Karsligil, M.E., Güvenç, L., Real time lane detection and tracking system evaluated in a hardware-in-theloop simulator (2010) International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, pp. 1336-1343. , Funchal; Kuang, P., Zhu, Q., Chen, X., A road lane recognition algorithm based on color features in AGV vision systems (2006) International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems, 1, pp. 475-479. , Guilin; Muad, A.M., Hussain, A., Samad, S.A., Mustaffa, M.M., Majlis, B.Y., Implementation of inverse perspective mapping algorithm for the development of an automatic lane tracking system (2004) IEEE Region 10 Conference TENCON 2004, 1, pp. 207-210; Matas, J., Galambos, C., Kittler, J.V., Robust detection of lines using the progressive probabilistic hough transform (2000) Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 78 (1), pp. 119-137. , April; Duda, R.O., Hart, P.E., Use of the hough transformation to detect lines and curves in pictures (1972) Communications of the ACM Magazine, 15 (1), pp. 11-15. , January; Qadi, A., Goddard, S., Huang, J., Farritor, S., Dynamic speed and sensor rate adjustment for mobile robotic systems (2007) 19th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems, , Pisa",,,"","IEEE Computer Society","2nd IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Cybernetics, IEEE CYBERNETICSCOM 2013","3 December 2013 through 4 December 2013","Yogyakarta",107263,,9781467360531,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE CYBERNETICSCOM: IEEE Int.

The quality characteristics of financial statements consist of comprehensiveness, relevance, materiality, reliability, honest presentation, substance outperforming form, neutrality, sound judgment, and completeness. The accounting information system functions to oversee all the company's financial activities and collect and store data on the company's financial activities or transactions. © 2020 EManuscript Technologies.

In addition, the hospital also provides consulting services that provide information and advice to patients. Hospitals in carrying out operational and investment activities are inseparable from the costs. Various kinds of services in hospitals incur costs. Transaction cycle in Hospital: (1) Revenue cycle related to providing hospital services to patients or other parties and receiving patient payments or bills from other parties; (2) The expenditure cycle is related to the procurement of goods and/or services from other parties and the settlement of debts and obligations; (3) Production/ service cycle related to the transformation of hospital resources into hospital services; (4) Financial cycles related to the acquisition and management of capital funds (capital funds), such as working capital (sources of cash funds or other liquid funds) and long-term funding sources; (5) The financial reporting cycle is not related to the operating cycle as the first four cycles above.

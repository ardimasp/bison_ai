It's reflected in the result of customer satisfaction survey. In this case, the IT Service Management (ITSM) performance measurement method became a very important matter, because with the best performance measurement, any deviation is expected to be followed up immediately. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to exploration the correlation of performance measurement IT service Management (ITSM) method with customer satisfaction level, and to recommend the design of ITSM performance evaluation method by aligning Balanced Scorecard (BSC) method which has been used as performance measurement method at enterprise level. In this study, correlation analysis is run by statistical test that is $T$ test and F test to prove three statistical hypotheses about the correlation. The results of this study is the correlation analysis and the design of performance evaluation method which is aligned with the implementation of BSC made in the form of dashboard ITSM made with the help of one of analytical tools. © 2018 IEEE.","balanced scorecard; correlation; dashboard; IT service management; performance management framework","Correlation methods; Information management; Sales; Balanced scorecards; Customer satisfaction survey; dashboard; IT service management; IT service management (ITSM); Performance evaluations; Performance management; Performance measurements; Customer satisfaction",,,,,"Chen, X., Siau, K.L., (2012) Effect of Business Intelligence and IT Infrastructure Flexibility on Organizational Agility, pp. 4-5. , Thirty Third International Conference on Information Systems, Orlando; Jäntti, M., Rout, T., Wen, L., Heikkinen, S., Cater-Steel, A., Exploring the Impact of IT Service Management Process Improvement Initiatives: A Case Study Approach; Gacenga, F., (2013) A Performance Measurement Framework for IT Service Management, , Queensland School of Information System, Faculty of Business and Law, University of Southerrn Quensland; Lempinen, H., (2012) Constructing A Design Framework for Performance Dashboards, , Aalto University School of Economics, Finland; Yigitbasioglu, O.M., Velcu, O., The use of dashboards in performance management: Evidence from sales managers (2012) The International Journal of Digital Accounting Research, 12, pp. 39-58; Kothari, C.R., Research Methodology, Methods and Techniques, , College of Commerce University of Rajasthan, India; Fajar, A.N., Budiardjo, E.K., Hasibuan, Z.A., (2012) System Architecture in Dynamic Environment Based on Commonality and Variability Business Processes. 8th ICCM Seoul IEEE, Seoul; Fajar, A.N., Shofi, I.M., Goal model to business process model: A methodology for enterprise government tourism system development International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 6 (6), pp. 3031-3036",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2018","3 September 2018 through 5 September 2018",,142373,,9781538658215,,,"English","Proc.

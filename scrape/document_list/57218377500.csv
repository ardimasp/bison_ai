Blockchain technology also believed to transform the existing identity management in a highly secure manner. Indonesia is one of the largest archipelagic country in the world, extending 5,120 km from east to west and 1,760 km from north to south with 237.6 million population, the fourth largest in the world. It will be very difficult to implement identity management for its citizen. There are multiple ID cards being used and accepted in Indonesia, from student card, driver license, tax id, etc. Blockchain technology is expected to simplify the existing identity management problems in Indonesia. This paper will try to describe the implementation, advantages and disadvantage of blockchain technology when applied to identity management in Indonesia. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

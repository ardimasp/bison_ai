The existence of this medical record can provide health profile information and medical history of the patients being treated. With this basis, doctors and medical staff can provide diagnoses, suggestions for actions to be taken as well as accuracy in determining the drug for patient consumption. However, medical records in the system at the hospital have not been packaged properly invalid data conditions, because the data collection and input processes were carried out by different officers. Not only the ability of officers to interact with information system modules but also discipline, accuracy, mastery of officers in the medical field as well as the ability to read manual documents to be re-entered into the information system. This research was carried out based on direct monitoring of the system used in several hospitals and found the existence of data invalidity in the information system that has the potential to become a risk that ultimately becomes a loss both for patients and for medical staff and hospital management. Allowing invalid data will be a threat that comes from within the hospital environment itself. © 2020 IEEE.","Data validation; Electronic medical record; Health information system; Information system security; Risk management","Diagnosis; Hospitals; Human resource management; Information management; Information use; Medical computing; Patient treatment; Data collection; Direct monitoring; Hospital environment; Hospital information systems; Hospital management; Medical fields; Medical history; Medical record; Medical information systems",,,,,"(2005) Information Technology Security Techniques Code of Practice for Information Security Management International, , I. 27002; Appari, A., Johnson, M.E., Information security and privacy in healthcare: Current state of research (2010) Int.

The transformation of the mobile banking application into a digital banking application conducted by banks has made users re-evaluate based on their preferences. This study presents the behavior of users of digital banking applications in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The hypothesis model is based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with additional factors of the social image, perceived risk and perceived trust adopted from Muñoz-Leiva et al. (2017). The methodology in this study includes data collection through questionnaires distributed online and data analysis using the Structural Equation Model. The results of this study illustrate that the perceived trust and perceived risk have a more dominant part in influencing user attitude and user intention to use digital banking. Meanwhile, social image, perceived ease-of-use and perceived usefulness are not significant in influencing user attitude and user intention to use digital banking. The implication of this research helps to determine the right communication and strategy so that more users with more benefits can utilize this digital banking application. © 2020.

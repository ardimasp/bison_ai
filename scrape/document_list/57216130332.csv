In this research, simulation is done to measure the delivery performance and all the processes included in delivery process. In fact, every process has their own risks could delay delivery process that the delivery performance is reduced. The methods used to identify the risks and the causes are Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). Risks analysis is done with the help of Pareto diagrams and scatter plot to determine the risks need to be corrected immediately. The proposed improvements are integrating the systems in form of e-cargo ready and implementing bar-coding. After the proposed e-cargo ready applied and being simulated, the delivery performance in terms of average total time reduced by 29,398%. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Delivery performance; FMEA; FTA; Simulation","Fault tree analysis; Risk analysis; Delivery performance; Delivery process; Failure mode and effects analysis; Fault tree analyses (FTA); FMEA; Improving delivery performance; Pareto diagrams; Simulation; Risk assessment",,,,,"Afolayan, A., White, G.R., Mason-Jones, R., (2016) Why Knowledge Acquisition Is Important to Effective Supply Chain Management: The Role of Supply Chain Managers 'As Knowledge Acquisitors; Peng, D.X., Lu, G., Exploring the impact of delivery performance on customer transaction volume and unit price: Evidence from an assembly manufacturing supply chain (2017) Production and Operations Management, 26 (5), pp. 880-902; Mewborn, S., Murphy, J., Williams, G., (2014) Clearing the Roadblocks to Better B2B Pricing, 12; Ghadge, A., Fang, X., Dani, S., Antony, J., Supply chain risk assessment approach for process quality risks (2017) International Journal of Quality & Reliability Management, 34 (7), pp. 940-954; Ruijters, E., Stoelinga, M., Fault tree analysis: A survey of the state-of-the-art in modeling, analysis and tools (2015) Computer Science Review, 15-16, pp. 29-62; Ehsanifar, M., Hamta, N., Hemesy, M., A Simulation Approach to Evaluate Performance Indices of Fuzzy Exponential Queuing System (An M/M/C Model in a Banking Case Study) (2017) Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management, 4, pp. 35-51; Ramírez, C.S., López, D.R.M., Hernández, G.A., Alcaraz, J.L.G., Mendoza, D.A.T., Simulation software as a tool for supply chain analysis and improvement (2016) Computer Science and Information Systems, 13 (3), pp. 983-998; Shirani, M., Demichela, M., Integration of FMEA and human factor in the food chain risk assessment (2015) World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, International Journal of Social, Behavioral, Educational, Economic, Business and Industrial Engineering, 9, pp. 4247-4250; Held, M., Brönnimann, R., Safe cell, safe battery?

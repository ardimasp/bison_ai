In Indonesia, one of the requirements to graduate from high school is to pass national mathematics examination. Many schools provided question bank to facilitate students in practicing mathematics. Unfortunately, the mathematics problems in question bank are not classified well, since the one who input the mathematics problem is not always a mathematics teacher. Hence, the problems should be labeled manually so administrator is able to know which topic and subtopic that problem had. It made students difficult to find the precise problem of math based on topic or subtopic. This research presents the classification of mathematic problem written with LaTeX based on topic and subtopic by using rule-based natural language processing, modified Term-Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Naive Bayes as a text mining algorithm. 780 mathematics problems are used in this research consisting of 18 topics and 52 subtopics from senior high school curriculum. The accuracy of this text mining is 91%. With this research question bank will be classified automatically that simplify administrator to input the mathematics problem into database and make it easier to students to find mathematics problem based on topic and subtopic. © 2020 ICIC International.

Initially, we build this application only to help Small and Medium Enterprise owner to monitor their business and report. Yet, we realize that we can make our chatbot to be more effective and efficient using machine learning technique. N-gram and machine learning using schema matching are embedded to the chatbot to understand user intention and correct typographical error inside the sentences. Finally, the chatbot has been successfully achieved those objectives. It can be concluded that the chatbot can drive the users' feeling to be more convenient and help Small and Medium Enterprise owner to monitor their business. © 2008-2019.

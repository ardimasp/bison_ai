The purpose of this research is to test the strategic performance measurement system (SPMS) framework through a quantitative approach and to assess the level of importance of variables in the SPMS framework by examining the effect of variables of organizational culture (OCL) on SPMS mediated by activity-based costing system (ABCS) and flexibility strategy (FLS), the effect of OCL on SPMS, the effect of ABCS on organizational performance (OPF), the effect of FLS on OPF and finally the effect of ABCS on OPF. The novelty of this research is to put the ABCS and FLS as mediating variables instead of independent variables as previous researches. The framework is hypothetic-deductive research. Primary data was collected through questionnaires. A number of 150 samples of the 250 questionnaires disseminated to both coal mine companies and mining contractors were collected and processed using SEM Lisrel version 8.7. The sample population was fairly distributed to coal mine organizations as unit of analysis. The results, using SEM Lisrel, OCL as an exogenous variable is positively related to both ABCS and FLS but does not affect SPMS directly. OCL is fully mediated by both ABCS and FLS. ABCS is positively related to both SPMS and OPF. FLS is positively related to SPMS but does not affect OPF directly. The SPMS is positively related to OPF. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Activity-based costing system; Flexibility strategy; Organizational culture; Organizational performance; Strategic performance measurement system",,,,,,"Bititci, U.S., Mendibil, M., Nudurupati, S., Turner, T., Garengo, P., Dynamics of performance measurement and organizational culture (2006) International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 26 (12), pp. 1325-1350; Braam, J.M., Nijssen, E.J., Performance effects of using the balanced scorecard: A note on the Dutch experience (2004) Long Range Planning, 37, pp. 335-349; Caccetta, L., Hill, S., An application of branch and cut to open pit mine scheduling (2003) Journal of Global Optimization, 27, pp. 349-365; Cameron, K.S., Quinn, R.E., (2005) Diagnosing and Changing Organizational Culture: Based on the Competing Values Framework, , Revised Edition.

This research raises the question on what strategies in developing valuations models of various mining and how uncertainty such as prices, grades/quality, costs, schedules, quantities, environmental issues and among others which are not known at the beginning of the project, have contributed to the value resulted. The study is based on an Expanded Net Present Value (eNPV) valuation in which uncertainty and management flexibility are incorporated into the valuation. The focus of the research is on the strategy in determining value using Expanded Net Present Value (eNPV) and on how to mitigate the risks of uncertainties. The paper emphasizes the specific characteristics of the actual mining valuation in Indonesia, generated by conventional NPV method commonly used. This was also confirmed in a study carried out by Graham and Campbell (2002), of 392 completed CFO surveys, 74.9% of respondents always or mostly use the Net Present Value (NPV) method of project valuation. However, conventional valuation tools have penalized projects with a high degree of uncertainty and lead to myopic decisions. The research is correlated to diagnose the flexibility of strategic mine planning and to analyze the process of change within the uncertainties. The study allows emphasis on some characteristics of the mining valuation process developed in Indonesia. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

Literally, it will make the young generation too lazy for outing activity or doing sports and busy with their digital technology, particularly their smartphone. Obviously, we are interested in using the mobile application which can be used to bridge the boring of doing sports mainly badminton sport, wherewith this mobile application is not just only for field badminton or coach booking, but can extend their friendship and community in positive ways. Hopefully, with this mobile application not just only booking for Badminton fields, but beyond that, there will be a mobile application that supports the fans of the badminton sports community when can know each other from different places and make friendship and competition among the members. At the end of the day, we hope this mobile application will support young people to stay away from trouble and drug and to have a positive life with the sport, particularly badminton sport as Indonesian's favorite sport. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Mobile computing; Smartphones; Digital technologies; End of the days; Indonesia; Mobile applications; Smart-phone applications; Young peoples; Sports",,,,,"Sunarya, A., Sutrisno, J., Sistem Informasi Penyewaan Lapangan Bulutangkis dan Penjualan Perlengkapan Maestro Angkasa (2018) Idealis, 1, pp. 358-362; Gunawan, H., Anggianto, Y., Pemanfaatan Teknologi Mobile Untuk Pemesanan Lapangan Berbasis Android (Studi Kasus: Orion Sport Center Purwokerto) (2016) MA, 7, p. 24; Case, M.A., Burwick, H.A., Volpp, K.G., Patel, M.S., Accuracy of Smartphone Applications and Wearable Devices for Tracking Physical Activity Data (2015) JAMA, 9, pp. 1-9; Pasternak, J.B., Cognitive Scripts, Anxiety, and Styles of Coping with Stress in Teenagers Practicing Sports (2018) The Journal of Human Kinetics, 65 (1), pp. 261-271; Charlotte, C., Hille, A., Lechner, M., Mozart or Pele? the effects of Teenagers Participation in Music and Sports CEPR Discussion Paper No. DP 10556; Can, L., Junjie, L., Cao, H., Zhan, M., Design and Implementation of Online Booking Systems of University Sports Avenue (2017) MATEC Web Conf, 100; Clark, R.W., (2018) An Exploratory Study of How Destination Marketing Organizations Pursue the Sports Tourism Market Has Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, 9, pp. 184-193; Newman, T., Peck, J., Wilhide, B., (2017) Social Media in Sports Marketing; Haris, H., Arfiansyah, M., Nuraini, E., RANCANG BANGUN APLIKASI RESERVASI TIKET PESAWAT ONLINE BERBASIS ANDROID (2018) Cerita, 2, pp. 142-150; Honggowibowo, A.S., Sediarte, T., Sistem Reservasi Pesawat Terbang Berbasis Web Jurnal Fakultas Hukum UII, 3, pp. 142-1502005; Phomsoupha, M., Laffaye, G., The Science of Badminton: Game Characteristics, Anthropometry, Physiology, Visual Fitness and Biomechanics (2015) Sports Med, 45 (4), pp. 473-495; Shahril, M.I., Jani, J., Salimin, N., Performance Assessment Instrument (PAI) Model for Badminton Based on Teaching Games for Understanding (TGfU) (2017) Advanced Science Letters, 23 (1), pp. 160-165; Wang, Y., Chen, M., Wang, X., Chan, R.H.M., Li, W.J., IoT for Next-Generation Racket Sports Training (2018) IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 5 (6), pp. 4558-4566; Idris, M.H., Hashim, S.Z.M., UTM Sports App Mobile Application (2017) UTM Computing Proceedings Innovation in Computing Technology and Applications; Falomir, Z., Ortega, J.A., Martinez, N., Guesguen, H., E-Gibalec: Mobile application to monitor and encourage physical activity in schoolchildren (2017) Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments, 9 (5), pp. 595-609; Cvetkovic, B., Janko, V., Gradisek, A., Lustrek, M., Kajtna, T., Strumbelj, B., Mobile Application to Stimulate Physical Activity in School children (2016) 12th International Conference on Intelligent Environments (IE), p. 206; Ginja, G.A., Applications of Virtual Reality in the Practice of Para-Badminton (2018) 20th Symposium on Virtual and Augmented Reality (SVR), p. 230; Shan, C.Z., (2018) SENSOR-BASED ASSESSMENT USING MACHINE LEARNING for PREDICTIVE MODEL of BADMINTON SKILLS","Anwar, N.; Faculty of Computer Science, Indonesia; email: nizirwan.anwar@esaunggul.ac.id","Vaidyanathan S.Mamat M.B.Lien C.-H.Ginta T.L.MujiartoSambas A.",,"Institute of Physics Publishing","2nd International Conference on Computer, Science, Engineering, and Technology, ICComSET 2019","15 October 2019 through 16 October 2019",,159200,17426588,,,,"English","J.

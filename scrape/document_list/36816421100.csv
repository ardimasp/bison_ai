In this paper we study the performance of two popular animation models - the skeletal and keyframe animation models. We have done some experiments using a testbed program to measure the performance, memory usage and hard disk space used by the two animation models. Our experiment results suggest that the skeletal model has major advantages over the keyframe model, both in terms of the FPS (frame per second) and the memory load. We conclude that the skeleton or bone based animation models are more suitable for multiplayer online role playing games (MORPG), where the bandwidth usage is very intensive. © 2010 IEEE.","Animation; Game development; Keyframe; Multiplayer game; Skeletal","Animation techniques; Bandwidth usage; Comparative studies; Game development; Hard disks; Key frames; Memory load; Memory usage; Multi-player online games; Multiplayer games; Multiplayers; Role-playing game; Skeletal; Skeletal models; Experiments; Hard disk storage; Musculoskeletal system; Software design; Telecommunication; Animation",,,,,"Phelps, A., (2005) Graphics Don't Matter (and Other Assertions), , http://gotgame.corante.com/archives/2005/06/13/ graphics_dont_matter_and_other_assertions.php, Internet: June 13, Feb. 11; Sanchez, D., Dumau, C., (2004) Core Techniques and Algorithms in Game Programming, , New Riders Publishing; (2008) Essential Facts about the Computer and Video Game Industry, , The Entertainment Software Association, The Entertainment Software Association (ESA); Gebhardt, N., (2009) Irrlicht Engine - A Free Open Source 3d Engine, , http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/, Internet: March 18, [April 10, 2009]; Villalobos, R., (2008) Exploring Multimedia for Designers, , Canada:Thomson Delmar Learning; Lasseter, J., (1987) Principles of Traditional Animation Applied to 3D Computer Animation, Computer Graphics, 21 (4), pp. 35-44. , July ACM Press; Maestri, G., (2006) Digital Character Animation 3, , Berkeley: New Riders Publishing; Adamo-Villani, N., 3D rendering of american sign language finger-Spelling: A comparative study of two animation techniques (2008) International Journal of Social Sciences, 3, p. 4; Gillies, M., Spanlang, B., Comparing and evaluating real time character engines for virtual environments (2010) Presence, 19 (2), pp. 95-117. , April The MIT Press","Pranatio, G.; School of Computer Science, , Jakarta, Indonesia; email: bokunomail@yahoo.com",,,,"2010 2nd International Conference on Advances in Computing, Control and Telecommunication Technologies, ACT 2010","2 December 2010 through 3 December 2010","Jakarta",83583,,9780769542690,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

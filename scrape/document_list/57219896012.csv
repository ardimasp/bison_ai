Many studies have been done to find an arrhythmia classification algorithm which has satisfactory learning speed and accuracy. However, many of those result in unstable performances in addition to slow learning speed. This research uses the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database from the PhysioNet Resource which will be tested through three stages: preprocessing performed by resampling and scaling, feature extraction using Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), and classification using the method of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) which has a high learning speed and accuracy. This research is limited to five classes of arrythmia: Paced Beat (PB), Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB), Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and the normal heart condition Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR). The parameters of accuracy, sensitivity, and computation time are tested out of 125 test data. The result shows that arrhythmia classification using ELM has 100% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and average computation time of 0.107 seconds. This result is also compared with another method in supervised learning used in classifications called Support Vector Machine (SVM) to prove that ELM is the suggested approach.

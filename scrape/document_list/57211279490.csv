Cesarean section cannot be performed if there is no agreement from the patient or family members regarding the surgery. In recent years, the use of machine learning in predicting disease has increased rapidly. One classification technique used in machine learning is artificial neural networks. In this study, we used backpropagation neural networks to predict cesarean section. This study uses a dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains information about the results of the cesarean section of 80 pregnant women with essential characteristics of labor problems in the medical field. Model evaluation is performed using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values. The area under curves (AUC) and ROC curves are used to calculate performance evaluations. Based on experimental results, research shows that backpropagation neural networks can be used as an alternative model in determining the cesarean section. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

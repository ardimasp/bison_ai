The general objective of research focuses on speech recognition systems to be able to interact with people naturally. Humanoid robots must be able to consider the question style and infer answers through automated, unreliable conversations in noisy environments. In development, there are still shortcomings that is if the answer is not in the knowledge base, the robot will look for the context that is most similar to the knowledge base, instead of giving an answer, the robot gives an answer 'not found'. Sometimes, the wrong answer will be displayed because the cosine value between the question and the wrong answer is influenced by the same context, that the truth is not the actual answer. Based on these problems, this study was conducted with the aim of producing structured data and information knowledge according to the topic of the question, producing knowledge storage designs, optimizing models based on design and knowing the performance of knowledge representation storage models. Based on these objectives, this research will design algorithms and modeling representation of Indonesian language knowledge that will be applied to humanoid robots. The expected output is an algorithm design and storage of knowledge representation on humanoid robots. © 2020 IEEE.","humanoid robot; Indonesian; knowledge representation; question answer","Anthropomorphic robots; Digital storage; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge representation; Machine design; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Indonesian languages; Knowledge database; Knowledge storage; Model representation; NAtural language processing; Optimizing models; Recognition algorithm; Speech recognition systems; Speech recognition",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

Weighbridge is an embedded system that is connected to the computer via the RS-232 port. Used to measure the weight of products like CPO (Crude Palm Oil), Kernel and Shell. Some problems caused by weighbridges system in Palm Oil Industry such as incorrect of Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) suppliers are often occurring, then incorrect selection of the FFB area, not saving weighing data, incorrect entry of the FFB sorting data, and incorrect selection of the sales contract. Therefore, the aim of the development is a more optimal system for solving these five problems and increasing the accuracy of the weighbridge. The research methodology used is the system development life cycle using a prototype model because it is more flexible and active, so that users can see, feel, and experience the development process, and repair errors relatively quickly. The results of the development of this system are systems designed to be more efficient by developing systems with application concepts that are connected to local network connections, so that one stage of the process can be combined with other processes and data can be interconnected between one process and another. © 2020 IEEE.","Arm gate; Barcode; Mobile application; Weighbridges","Information management; Life cycle; Palm oil; Sales; Development process; Local networks; Mobile application design; Plant productivity; Prototype models; Research methodologies; Sales contracts; System development life cycles; Petroleum industry",,,,,,,"Boumans, G., (2012) Grain Handling and Storage, , Netherlands: Elsevier; Marshall, H., Murphy, G., Factors affecting the accuracy of weighbridge systems (2013) International Journal of the Forest Engineering, 14 (1), pp. 67-79; Sukimin, K., Perancangan sistem pnegolahan data timbang pabrik minyak kelapa sawit (cpo mill) dengan bahasa pemrograman visual basic 6. 0 pada pt. hindoli banyuasin palembang sematera selatan (2012) Expert-Jurnal Manajemen Sistem Informasi Dan Teknologi, 2 (2), pp. 54-61; Yu, L., Yongjun, L., Development and application of an efficient sugar refinery farm management information system (2012) Computer Science & Education (ICCSE 2012); Yang, L.Q., Wang, H., The analysis and design of weighbridge network monitoring system based on RFID (2012) Advanced Materials Research, 403, pp. 3153-3157; Pushparani, M., Sagaya, A., Towards aframework for embedded weight comparison algorithm with business intelligence in the plantation domain (2016) International Journal of Computer, Electrical, Automation, Control and Information Engineering, 10 (7), pp. 1376-1388; Kawaguchi, H., Wachi, T., Yagi, S., Weighbridge survey for freight policy analysis in the central Java region, Indonesia (2011) The 90th Annual Transportation Research Board Meeting; Kopczynski, T., Ness, D., Five factors that can affect your weighing system's accuracy (2001) Powder and Bulk Engineering, 15 (9), pp. 31-37; Kannan, P., Basaruddin, K.H., Monitoring and reporting of oil palm fresh fruit bunch (ffb) transactions among independent smallholders and dealers: An analysis of a case study in selangor, Malaysia (2017) Oil Palm Industry Economic Journal, 17, pp. 68-81",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","5th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2020","13 August 2020 through 14 August 2020",,163671,,9781728170718,,,"English","Proc.

Speech as input to Google is known as the Ok Google feature. However, many search engine users never pay attention to search engine definitions. So, websites are only limited to projects without further management, and that is what happens to the current website. Therefore, in this study, an assessment of usability is conducted on Google especially in the Ok Google feature using Nielsen Model. The research method used in this research is the quantitative research approach, a method which includes approach and kind of research, population and sample, instrument, data collection technique, and data analyze. Data collection techniques include learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors and satisfaction assessment and Likert scale ranges from 1 to 4. It can be signed into categories of sites with usability values, namely “very difficult to understand,” “difficult to understand”, “easy to understand” and “very easy to understand”. The construct validity is with Orthogonal Iterations with Index reliability of 0.91. The results of this study are the usability testing of Ok Google tends to be significance (α) of 5% with data of 124 is 1.66, feedback statement in the questionnaire is considered valid, then the questionnaire results show α = 0.91 which means the measurement of usability on Ok Google Feature is an excellent level. The average usability value obtained by Ok Google in Indonesia is included in the category of usability “easy to understand”. In addition, it was found that Ok Google has the highest memorability level and the lowest error. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Speech recognition; Usability; Website",,,,,,,,"Qustoniah, A., Perancangan Sistem Pengenalan Pola Suara Menggunakan Metode Piecewise Dynamic Time Warping (2012) Widya Tek, 20 (1), pp. 11-17; Ronando, E., Irawan, M.I., Pengenalan Ucapan Kata Sebagai Pengendali Metode Linear Predictive Coding—Neuro Fuzzy (2012) J.

One form is e-learning. In its development, e-learning has several problems when faced with the background and needs of students who take part in learning. These differences affect the effectiveness of learning because not all students have the same learning style. To over-come these problems, researchers tried to use fuzzy logic methods. Fuzzy logic is chosen to answer the uncertainty that occurs in learning subjective student characters. Therefore, the study was conducted on one e-learning website called sasmoko.com.

Mango maturity level often makes farmers confused when choosing a mango that has a good maturity. Sometimes, mango farmers still use manual methods to distinguish mango maturity, while the way that human labor is often inaccurate and different in its determination. The difference is due to the different perceptions of each person. From these problems then the need of machine sorting system on agriculture is felt important. Therefore, researchers will conduct research on mango sortation system. Mango has many types such as ""Harum Manis"", ""Apple"", ""Gincu"", etc. In this study type of mango that will be studied is mango ""Gincu"" because has a good color distribution. The goal of the research is to create a system that can sort mango that ripe or unripe. The method that used to do this research is separated into few step: problem identification, algorithm development, implementation and evaluation. The system is made using C language, Computer Vision and ANN (Artificial Neural Network) so the system can detect the color of mango that has been ripe or unripe. The output of this research will be compared to related research. The final output of this research is the system can detect the ripe or unripe mango with 94% accuracy. © 2017 The Authors.

Unfortunately the development of interesting and entertaining adaptive multiplayer game based learning for math and science that consider psychological aspects and game balancing for students on mobile platforms that have game balancing is very limited. This paper proposes an integrated model of adaptive Math and Science game based learning for elementary school students with adjustable level of difficulty based on user's ability and additional option for ""Free"" and ""Adventures"" modes. We propose a method where level of difficulty can be adjusted based on previous score, using fuzzy two inputs in the form of percentage correct and the speed of answer to produce output.

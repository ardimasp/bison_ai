Teenagers have problems when studying biology which consists of many foreign terms, and many abstract theories. Teachers also find it difficult to convey the material so students can easily understand it and attract students' attention. To attract the attention of teenagers so that they are easy to understand, digital technology is needed that has an attractive visual and interface. Augmented Reality (AR) technology provides a new way of learning for teenagers in learning. AR has been widely applied in the delivery of learning materials such as mathematics, physics, astronomy. Therefore AR can also be used in delivering biology material. Users who, on average, need a design interface that suits their needs. Researchers are now also starting to conduct research to find suitable modeling for the needs of teenagers commonly known as Teen-Computing Interaction. To help overcome the obstacles of teenagers in learning the Animal Taxonomy, the researchers propose developing a multimedia-based application by applying Augmented Reality technology that implements the design of a Teen-Computer Interaction based interface. © 2019 IEEE.","Augmented Reality; biology; Multimedia; Teen-Computer Interaction","Animals; Augmented reality; Computation theory; Students; Taxonomies; Abstract theory; Augmented reality technology; Computer interaction; Design interface; Digital technologies; Interactive applications; Learning materials; Taxonomy learning; Engineering education",,,,,"Nafisah, D., (2011) Identifikasi Kesulitan Belajar Ipa Biologi Siswa Kelas Ix Smp Negeri 5; Insani, M.D., Studi pendahuluan identifikasi kesulitan dalam pembelajaran pada guru ipa smp se-kota malang (2016) Jurnal Pendidikan Biologi, 2, pp. 81-93; Wahyudin, Sutikno, Isa, A., Keefektifan pembelajaran berbantuan multimedia menggunakan metode inkuiri terbimbing untuk meningkatkan minat dan pemahaman siswa.

Studies have consistently indicated that students generally believed that the use of technology for oral presentation would facilitate their learning. Students in such condition believed that the class was more organized, clear and interesting. Students also liked the teacher/lecturer more and indicated that they would like to take another class from the teacher/lecturer when the he or she used technology means of presentation. This research was focusing on the perspective of students in Binus University regarding the advantages or disadvantages of this model of learning process in regard of interesting or boring and long or short endurance of understanding. The visual aid presentation here meant that the students were the ones who were performing the presentation, instead of the teacher/lecturer. The research method used was descriptive qualitative based on the survey and interview of some sample students who were chosen randomly, who were taking English course in first/second semester.Based on some researches, the visual aid presentation in learning process was showing positive impact for teachers and students. Therefore, the hypothesis on this research was that the visual aid presentation on learning process would bring an interesting environment, long endurance of understanding and improving students' behavior. It was expected that the result of this research could be used to improve the learning method of English learning in Binus University in order to support Binus Vision to be a global university and to enrich graduates with the skill of oral presentation.The respondents were selected from management students in Binus, Alam Sutera Campus, and randomly chosen. All of the respondents replied that learning by doing presentations was giving more understanding on topics, boosting up self-confident, teaching public speaking, handling nervous and creating a dynamic class environment to avoid boredom. From the students' point of view, this learning method was giving advantage for students and long endurance of understanding. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Learning systems; Technical presentations; Colleges and universities; English Learning; Learning by doing; Learning English; Learning methods; Oral presentations; research methods; Students' behaviors; Students",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement","This work is supported by the Research and Technology Transfer Office (RTTO), a part of Research Grant to Binus Faculty Member.","Alkash, K.A., Al-Dersi, Z.E., Advantages of Using PowerPoint Presentation in EFL Classroom & the (2013) Journal of English Language & Translation Studies, 1; (2015) Rencana Strategis Penelitian Binus University Tahun 2015-2019.; Willyarto, M.N., Chairiyani, R., Pane, M., Mathematics Learning Method of Bar Modeling for Grade 7 Students (2015) Advanced Science Letters, 21 (7), pp. 2328-2331; Benawa, A., Gea, A.A., Willyarto, M.N., Improving Teacher's Commitment by Improving External Factors (2017) Advanced Science Letters, 23 (2), pp. 925-928; Willyarto, M.N., Werhoru, D., Gea, A.A., (2017) International Symposium on Educational Technology.; Apperson, J.M., Laws, E.L., Scepansky, J.A., The impact of presentation graphics on students (2006) Computers and Education, 47 (1), pp. 116-126; Oommen, A., Teaching English as a Global Language in Smart Classrooms with PowerPoint Presentation (2012) English Language Teaching, 5 (12), pp. 54-61; Chou, P.N., Chang, C.C., Lu, P.F., Prezi versus PowerPointL the Effects of Varied Digital Presentation Tools on Students' Learning Performance (2015) Computers and Education, 91, pp. 73-82; Layne, A., Doing Qualitative Community Research: Lesson for Faculty, Students and Community (2014) Pshycology Research, 4; Fraenkel, J.R., Wallen, N.E., (2008) How to Design and Evaluate Research in Education, Seventh Edition.; Yunus, U., Symbols of Cross Cultural Communication in Kasepuhan Palace Indonesia (2017) International Journal of Philosophy of Culture and Axiology, 14 (1), pp. 171-176",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","4th International Conference on Computing and Applied Informatics 2019, ICCAI 2019","26 November 2019 through 27 November 2019",,161570,17426588,,,,"English","J.

With the implementation of interactive learning activities regarding the introduction of the crossing signs, is expected to occur for increasing perceptual-motor skills of the research subjects. Perceptual-motor skills are associated with the ability to react quickly to any situations on the street. Through interactive learning activities, the subject research has shown their positive responses and enthusiasm in doing those activities. The research subject is ten preschool students aged 4-5. The process of data collection is conducted through observations, interviews, personal documents of the students, distributing the questionnaire to parents, as well as documentation such as photographs. The research was without IoT. The result of this research found out that the subject research's perceptual motor skills seemed to increase regarding the reaction of speed and correctness from their body movement toward the visual information given. This acquisition appears after the research subject were given some fun and hands-on activities at school especially about an introduction to the crossing signs for preschool children. It was recommended to use IoT for better achievement. © 2019 IEEE.","Interactive learning; Internet of Things; Perceptual motor skills; Road safety","Accident prevention; Artificial intelligence; Educational technology; Internet of things; Learning systems; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Surveys; Hands-on activities; Interactive learning; Perceptual motor skill; Personal documents; Preschool children; Research subjects; Road safety; Visual information; Traffic signs",,,,,,"Thomson James, A., Tolmie, A., Foot, H.C., McLaren, B., (1996) Child Development and the Aims of Road Safety Education: A Review and Analysis, , Road Safety, Research Report No. 1, Department of Transport, UK; Wortham Sue, C., (2006) Early Childhood Curriculum Developing Bases for Learning and Teaching.

Therefore, the authors conducted research related to the use of English in teaching Mathematics, for grade 7 junior high school in a private national plus school. The purpose of this study is for the reader to open up further insights related to the topic above. This research was carried out with experimental design, by doing different treatment between classes in the same level. The subjects of the study consisted of 63 students spread into 3 classes, 7 Amos, Esther 7 and 7 Jonah. Class 7 Jonah is a control group, using Bahasa Indonesia (mother tongue) in learning Mathematics. Class 7 Amos and 7 Esther is the experimental group, where 7 Amos in English and 7 Esther used bilingual (English and Indonesian). Results of the study include the following: the use of English is not detrimental to the students in score acquisition, is evident from the class treated differently, giving an average final score of Mathematics that are not significantly different. The obstacles that arise in learning Mathematics needs to be reviewed from the process, readiness, independence, motivation of students and needs to be followed up critically so that students can achieve good results. Programs of short and long term needs to be created and observed in order to support the learning process of Mathematics for students, such as training teachers to be able to speak English, training teachers to teach Mathematics, especially for young children, to support action research by teachers, managed by the school. © 2017 IEEE.","English; Learning; Mathematics","Educational technology; Mathematical techniques; Personnel training; Students; Teaching; Action research; Different treatments; English; Experimental groups; Junior high schools; Learning; Learning Mathematics; Learning process; Education",,,,,,"Bernardo, A.B.I., Language and mathematical problem solving among billinguals (2002) The Journal of Psychology.

Therefore, the author tries to explain a method for teaching mathematics (especially for elementary school students), to be easily understood by students. As a result, mathematics is no longer perceived hard. One good method of learning mathematics is the use of models (bar modeling). The author conducted research by providing two different treatments, without bar modeling and with bar modeling, to the elementary school students. The result showed that the use of bar modeling has increased students’ scores significantly.

At this time, the market has been populated with many mobile apps with similar capabilities, making the competition extremely stringent. The purpose of this research is to obtain a more profound understanding regarding the features of the apps that influence the customers in using the online food delivery services. Thus, the results are of importance for businesses and developers. The results should provide a recommendation for the design and effectiveness of the app. The theoretical framework of the study is established by literature reviews of several existing models. In general, those sources focused on five main attribute factors in the apps, namely, Visual Design, Information Design, Navigation Design, Collaboration Design, and Service Level. Data are collected by using a questionnaire and obtained from a sample of 401 respondents. The data are analyzed by a multivariate linear regression model using SPSS software. The results suggest that those factors are equally important in influencing the Conversion Rate of the customers. © 2020 ICIC International.

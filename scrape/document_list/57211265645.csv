Carsharing system it self offer solutions for common problem that usually found in urban areas like traffic jam and pollution. PT XYZ is the company that providing carsharing through it's mobile application. However, the percentage of user that reusing the application is still low. This study aims to analyze factors that influence user intention to reuse the application using Expectation Confirmation Model (ECM) Usage sample were taken from 231 user who have done at least rent a car once from the application. The data samples were analyzed using Partial Least Square Method (PLS) with SmartPLS 3.0. The result showed that perceived usefulness, satisfaction and service quality directly affecting reuse intention. meanwhile, your confirmation task technology fit indirectly affecting reuse intention of Carsharing. © 2019 IEEE.","carsharing; expectation confirmation model; partial least square; reuse intention; SmartPLS","Information management; Mobile computing; Traffic congestion; Carsharing; Expectation-confirmation models; Partial least square (PLS); reuse intention; SmartPLS; Least squares approximations",,,,,"Dill, J., McNeil, N., Dan Howland, S., Effects of peer-to-peer carsharing on vehicle owners' travel behavior (2019) Transportation Research Part C, 101, pp. 70-78; Yoon, T., Cherry, C.R., Ryerson, M.S., Dan Bell, J.E., Carsharing demand estimation and fleet simulation with EV adoption (2019) Journal of Cleaner Production, 206, pp. 1051-1058; Lemperta, R., Zhaoa, J., Dan Dowlatabadia, H., Convenience, savings, or lifestyle?

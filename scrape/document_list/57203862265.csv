Data was taken by distributing questionnaires using the Likert scale to 126 offshore oil and gas workers. The combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches was used in this study. The research data were analyzed by descriptive analysis method and validated using SPSS statistical software ver.16 to ensure the research data had good validity, reliability and accuracy. The results of the study show that the main causes of fatal work accidents in the offshore oil and gas industry are human errors, conditions of workers who are not fit and lack of knowledge. The type of human error that causes it is disobedience, lack of rest or fatigue, and not concentration. Meanwhile, the most ergonomically dangerous type of activity is working at height, lifting, and working in a confined space. From this study it can also be concluded that human factors have a greater influence compared to the effect of ergonomic factors. Based on the results of these studies, it was designed a simple tool to test the level of fitness both physically and mentally from workers in the offshore oil and gas industry to prevent fatal work accidents. © IAEME Publication","Ergonomic; Fatal Work Accident; Human Factors; Offshore; Prevention",,,,,,"Besnard, D., Hollnagel, E., I want to believe: Some myths about the management of industrial safety (2014) Cogn Tech Work, 16, pp. 13-23; Jahangiri, M., Hoboubi, N., Rostamabadi, A., Keshavarzi, S., Hosseini, A.A., Human error analysis in a permit to work system: A case study in a chemical plant (2016) Safety and Health at Work, 7, pp. 06-11; Bridges, W., Tew, R., Human factors elements missing from process safety management (PSM) (2010) Process Improvement Institute, 6th Global Congress on Process Safety and The 44th Annual Loss Prevention Symposium, pp. 01-24; (2010) Elementary Statistic, , Almelda & Sarte Quezon City: Diliman; Kothari, (2014) Research Methodology (Methods and Techniques), , India: New Age International Publisher; Boone, H.N., Boone, D.A., Analyzing Likert data (2012) Journal of Extensions, 50 (2), pp. 01-05; Pramesti, G., (2014) Kupas Tuntas Data Penelitian Dengan SPSS 22, , Jakarta: PT Elex Media Komputindo; Faktor dan Penjadwalan Shift Kerja (2008) Teknoin, 13 (2), pp. 11-12. , Maurits & Widodo; Sutalaksana, (1979) Teknik Tata Cara Kerja, , Bandung: Depertemen Teknik Industri ITB; Megiso, T.D., Passengers ergonomics evaluation of locally modified intercity buses Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (2017) International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Technology, 8 (1), pp. 70-80",,,,"IAEME Publication",,,,,09766340,,,,"English","Int.

The effective use of these AEDs in public places by lay bystanders is important to improve the survival rate. Unfortunately, many people still have limited knowledge about AED and its critical function and lack of willingness to use the device. This research intends to measure the proportion of people in public places who have the knowledge concerning AED device and its use. The relevant data are collected by a survey on a random sample of 400 participants performed at the busiest railway station in Jakarta, Indonesia. The results suggest that almost 65% of them are unaware of the existence of the device in the public places. As many as 35% respondents do not recognize the device, and less than 35% respondents are willing to use the equipment. © 2018, ICIC International.

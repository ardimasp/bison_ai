It reflects how the Westerners view the Easterners. The title of the study aims to explore the concept of Orientalism from a selected western novel by Updike entitled Terrorist. The novel portrays the image of a Muslim-Arab character; Ahmad who is the protagonist of the novel Terrorist. The paper also shows how Muslim-Arabs are drawn to terrorism not because of their nature which are prone to terrorist acts but are due to the misinterpretation of the Holy Quran. The paper consists of three sections: the first section is an introduction about Updike's Terrorist The second section tackles the different viewpoints pertaining to the concept of Orientalism. Section three analyses Updike's novel as an Orientalist novel. Finally, the conclusion and recommendation for further studies are forwarded. © 2018, Universidad del Zulia.

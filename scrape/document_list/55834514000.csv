One of the initial problems with SIS implementation was that it depended on the availability of computers and internet access. With slow internet connections, authentication process could be time consuming, especially if a website implements various external scripts to improve visual quality. Due to these reasons, as well as the fact that BlackBerry is one of the most popular smartphones in Indonesia, the developers decided to design a simpler but more powerful system that would resolve Blackberry Mobile SIS problems. The mobile SIS was designed, implemented and evaluated to provide a perfect solution for problems related to ease-of-access. The Mobile SIS facilitates students and parents in obtaining academic information anytime, anywhere and without the need for repeated authentication, via BlackBerry mobile connection. Mobile SIS also offers faster loading time relative to traditional website access. Using the push technology service, SIS could now provide students and parents in getting the latest information every time new information gets disseminated. © 2013 Science Publications.","Mobile phone; Push technology; School information system",,,,,,"Davenport, T.H., Prusak, L., (2000) Working Knowledge: How Organizations Manage What They Know. 2nd Edn., p. 199. , Harvard Business Press, Boston, USA., ISBN-10: 1578513014; Guthery, S.B., Cronin, M.J., (2002) Mobile Application Development with SMS and the SIM Toolkit. 1st Edn., p. 305. , McGraw-Hill, New York, ISBN- 10: 0071375406; Heikkinen, K., Eerola, J., Jappinen, P., Porras, J., (2007) Personalized view of personal information, , University of Technology, Lappeenranta; Juhlin, D., (2010) Mobile application analytics: Specification for an online analytics tool, , MSc, Thesis Lulea University of Technology; Jun, G., Tarasewich, P., (2006) Guidelines for handheld mobile device interface design, , Northeastern University; Laird, T., (2002) Character at Work, , University Park, Pennsylvania, PA; Ludford, P.J., Frankowski, D., Reily, K., Wilms, K., Terveen, L., (2006) Because I carry my cell phone anyway: Functional location-based reminder applications, pp. 889-898. , Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, Apr. 22-27, ACM Press, Montreal, Canada, DOI: 10.1145/1124772.1124903; Payne, S.J., Understanding calendar use (1993) Hum.

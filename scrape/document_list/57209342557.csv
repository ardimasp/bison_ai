There are 3 parameters that will be used in this study based on Quality of Services parameter, throughput, response time and latency. There are 4 different services will be tested to get the result of quality of services, Installment Services, Customer Services, Blacklist Customer Services and Account Services. The result of analysis showed that there was significant difference in the Quality of Services between Loan Approval System Web Services using SOAP Web Service and REST Web Service. The results can be concluded that REST Web service is more appropriate to be used in the integration between Loan Approval System and Core system. © 2019 F. Lumban Gaol and R.

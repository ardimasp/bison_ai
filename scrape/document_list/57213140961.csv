Therefore, it is necessary to develop the implementation of information systems in the company to be able to facilitate the business processes that are running well and become more effective and efficient. One strategic application in a company is a human resource information system, but its implementation is often constrained, so the expected targets are very difficult to meet; therefore, it is necessary to look for factors that cause gaps between the targets set and the realization that occurs in human resources information system. The research method used is the method of collecting data by observing, studying the literature, and distributing questionnaires to respondents using the application, to analyze the results of the questionnaire data using the factor analysis method. The results achieved in this study are the existence of employee capital management factors, capital business process factors, and Human Resource Monitoring factors that affect the target gap and implementation performance realization. The conclusion that is obtained from these three new factors can be built a performance solution model of the implementation of human resource information systems.

It is important in the business environment to work with the internet and where information sent and received has more types of threats and vulnerabilities. This paper wants to discuss two methods for assessing information system security risks in financial technology institutions. The methods to be discussed are the VECTOR Matrix method and the OCTAVE Allegro method. The VECTOR method is a security risk assessment method used to prioritize critical risks. While the method for carrying out a more detailed level of security risk analysis, it is recommended to use the OCTAVE Allegro approach. What IS security practices can learn is the reason for choosing the VECTOR Matrix and OCTAVE Allegro method. That these two methods are complementary during the information security risk assessment process in the business environment. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

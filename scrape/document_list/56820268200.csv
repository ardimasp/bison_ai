The root of the environmental crisis today that is due because of the ""human factors"". Human mindset embodied in various forms of exploitation of the natural act of damaging our environment tragically. Understand anthropocentrism is so permeated human thought patterns stimulate human passion to continue to exploit nature without human arbitrarily. Natural objectified and regarded as a place to suck it for the benefit of human. And nature environment needs to be protected by human as moral person. One way to protect nature is not a great design technology, but change the mind set of people from anthropocentric paradigm to eco centrism awareness in order to protect the environment entity. The purpose of this study is to build a construction of ecological thinking to support environmental protection efforts. Using reflection methods especially deconstruction of Derrida, continuously critical of anthropocentrism is a must as one way to protect the environment in theoretical thinking frame. Through this frame of thinking, it can have constructed the concept of ecological awareness for protecting environment and the good condition to the earth and all reality of life. This concept is useful for enriching theoretical thinking to protect the environment. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Ecology; Derrida; Design technologies; Ecological awareness; Environmental crisis; Human being; Nature environments; Protecting environments; Reflection methods; Environmental protection",,,,,"Anton, G., (2005) Character Building IV: A Relation with Nature, Science and Technology; Yety, R., (2002) Environmental Management Model for Business Development of the Productive Potential of Women in Rural; (2011) Effectiveness of Environmental Dispute Resolution in Indonesia, , The research of Bappenas Team the University of Leiden; (2012) Research Environmental Issues in Indonesia, , The Report of the National Scientific Seminar VIII; Molina, D., Ecophilosophical principles for an ecocentric environmental education on (2019) Education Sciences, 9; Allen, S., Cunliffe, A.L., Easterby-Smith, M., Understanding sustainability through the lens of ecocentric radical-reflexivity: Implications for management education (2019) Journal of Business Ethics, 154 (3), pp. 781-795; Smith, W., The role of environment clubs in promoting ecocentrism in secondary schools: Student identity and relationship to the earth on (2019) Journal of Environmental Education, 50 (1), pp. 52-71; Vlasov, M., In transition toward the ecocentric entrepreneurship nexus: How nature helps entrepreneur make venture more regenerative over time on (2019) Organization and Environment, pp. 108602661983144; Washington, H., Foregrounding ecojustice in conservation on (2018) Biological Conservation Journal, 228, pp. 367-374; White, R., Ecocentrism and criminal justice on (2018) Theoretical Criminology, 22 (3), pp. 342-362; Bozonet, J.P., Ecocentrism in Europe A narrative for a post-industrial and post-religious conception of nature on (2017) Europan Values Studies, 17, pp. 86-103; Fios, F., Eco-philosophy for industry practices in Indonesia on (2015) Advanced Science Letter, 21 (4), pp. 907-909; Allan, M., (2002) The Unity of Nature: Wholeness and Disintegration in Ecology and Science; Sony, A.K., (2009) Ecology Ethics; Frederikus, F., (2013) Introduction to Philosophy: Science and Logic; Henryk, S., (1994) The Participatory Mind: A New Theory of Knowledge and the Universe, p. 17; David, C.K., (2010) The Great Turning, from Empire to the Earth Community","Fios, F.; Character Building Development Centre, Jl.

Often the activity of exploiting natural material energy is only oriented to human interests, but ignores aspects of sovereignty (autonomy) of nature and the future of members of the local community of exploitation place. This paper shows field observations and literature reviews on the practice of energy exploitation of natural materials in Eastern Indonesia, which lacks attention to the dimensions of the balance of nature and the interests of local communities. Eastern Indonesia has not prospered because it is still struggling to obtain their sovereignty in the exploitation of natural materials in their own land. Often social conflicts arise due to the exploitation of material energy carried out. This study aims to find the phenomenon of natural exploitation in eastern Indonesia and build awareness to create sovereignty for local communities. The research method uses interpretative analysis and philosophical reflection to get meaning. Research found a theoretical model that is useful for overcoming the problem of exploitation that occurs. Those humans must transform themselves into ecological human beings so that they can bring practical benefits to the good of nature and East Indonesia local people towards the vision of sustainable development. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Ecology; Philosophical aspects; Development activity; Energy exploitation; Field observations; Literature reviews; Natural materials; research methods; Social conflicts; Theoretical modeling; International law",,,,,"Martin, G., (2003) The Death of Our Planet Species, p. 3; Allan, M., (2002) The Unity of Nature, p. 24; Volynskaya, O.A., Space resources exploitation from the international and domestic law Perspectives: The Russian approach on (2016) Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC201667th International Astronautical Congress, IAC; White, N., Conflict stalemate in Morocco and Western Sahara: Natural resources, legitimacy and political recognition on (2015) British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies, 42 (3), pp. 339-357; Zetter, R., Blitz, B.K., Contestation and reconstruction: Natural capital and post-conflict development in borderland regions on (2014) Stability Open Access, 3, p. 18; Dutilleul, F.C., The law pertaining to food issues and natural resources exploitation and trade on (2012) Agriculture and Food Security Open Access, 1; (2017), http://indonesiatimur.co/definisi/18ofMay2017; Kementerian Hukum Dan Hak Asasi Manusia, , http://www.kemenkumham.go.id/wilayah-indonesia-timur, http://www.kemenkumham.go.id/wilayah-indonesia-tengah; (2015) Maplecroft's Climate Change Vulnerability Index, , (Maplecroft) (Indeks Dampak Perubahan Iklim) oleh lembaga dunia; (2016), https://jaganyala.wordpress.com/2016/03/22/aksi-seribu-lilin-mahasiswa-maluku-menolak-eksploitasi-hutan-2/; (2015), http://regional.kompas.com/read/2015/03/09/17032061/Tolak.Tambang.Warga.Bakar.Fasilitas.Perusahaan; (2015), https://m.tempo.co/read/news/2015/10/22/058712051/tolak-tambang-tak-berizin-di-ntt-iniyang-dialami-pendemo; (2015), http://regional.kompas.com/read/2015/03/03/2148470/Protes.Warga.di.NTT.Gelar.Misa.di.Lokasi.Tambang; (2016), http://indonesia.ucanews.com/2016/01/29/tokoh-agama-di-ntt-dampingi-warga-demo-tolak-tambang/; Hendryk, S., (1981) Eco-Philosophy: Designing New Tactics for Living, , Boston: M.

This is a preliminary study that aims to map the possibility of wind energy in the border areas of Indonesia and Timor Leste, especially in North Central Timor District, East Nusa Tenggara Province, Indonesia. The method of research is the qualitative method with participatory observation approach. The results of the study found that the potential of wind energy in Mount Ainiut that can generate electricity of 7 x 3.5 = 24.5 Megawatts can be consumed 20,000 homes and small industries scattered around the West Timor Region. Local people are also open to accept the construction of microgrid electric technology facilities based on wind energy that is environmentally friendly. The findings of potential wind and acceptance of local communities can be important information for the Indonesian government to adopt relevant policies to support development efforts to provide electricity for communities in Indonesia's border regions of Indonesia and Timor Leste where satisfactory electricity needs are not yet met. Collaboration of the private and government sectors, especially the ministries in charge of the mineral resources of the Republic of Indonesia is very important.

Nowadays, we can not deny the existence of a problem that is created between the human and the environment. Humans in this paper refer to the subject or industry practitioners in Indonesia. Then, the environment refers to the objective conditions of the affected Indonesian perpetrators of the industry in question. Human existence that industry and the environment can not be denied existence. These two elements create unfair conditions, because industries practices often overlook the ethical values in the context of eco-philosophy. Low labor costs, the industries concentrated in Java and Sumatra, and monopolistic practices of natural resources, forests and pollution are concrete examples of industrial practice in Indonesia, which have a negative impact on humans and the environment. Injustice on others and the environmental crisis can not be avoided.

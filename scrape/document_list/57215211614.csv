The development of the ballistocardiography (BCG) sensor enables the possibility of dayto-day and portable monitoring at home. The goal of this study is to develop an IoT sleep quality monitoring system using BCG sensors, microcontrollers and cloud servers. The BCG sensor produces ECG data from the physical activity of the patient. The data is sent to the sensor and is read by the microcontroller. The sensor data is collected and pre-processed in the microcontroller. The microcontroller then transmits the data obtained from the BCG sensor to the cloud server for further analysis, i.e. to assess the sleep quality. The assessment of data transmission efficiency and resource consumption is carried out in this paper. The findings of the evaluation show that the proposed method achieves higher efficiency, lower response time and decreases memory usage by up to 77% compared to the conventional method. © 2013 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization.","Ballistocardiography; ECG; HRV; Internet-of-things; Sleep quality",,,,,"039/VR, RTT/IV/2019","This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled ""Prototipe dan Aplikasi Monitoring Kualitas Tidur Portabel berbasis Teknologi Cloud Computing dan Machine Learning"" or ""Portable Sleep Quality Monitoring Prototype and Application based on Cloud Computing Technology and Machine Learning"" with contract number: 039/VR.

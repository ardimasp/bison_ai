By using force limiting (FL) feature, where the force of the arm robot is limited and controlled, the robot can sense collision and stop its movement when it occurs. The idea is to apply the mentioned concept for service purposes. In this research a 6-axis arm robot with collision detection is developed. The design of the arm robot adopted the design of Universal Robot's UR3 with each joint capable of 360° rotation. The design approach is chosen for its flexibility to work in tight space with a maximum reach of half meter, as it is intended to work closely with human. This initial version robot is not intended to carry heavy load or move at high precision. With a maximum load of one Kg, this arm robot targets numerous applications that help human to do complex repetitive tasks, extend the reach of human operators, and help humans on many daily chores that usually does not involve heavy loads. The whole frame, which also serve as the cover of the robot, was made by 3D printing with multiple materials that fit to the strength and temperature requirement at each part of the robot. In order to detect collision, the arm robot employed smart servos at each joint with the ability to detect overcurrent and overvoltage, which allow the implementation of force limiting (FL) feature that will stop the robot in case of collision. The resulting arm robot managed to lift1 kg load and able stop its movement in the event of collision. Future research to improve the movement precision of the arm robot by adaptive methods is promising. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","3D Printing; Arm robot; Collaborative; Force Limiting; Service Robot","3D printers; Mobile robots; 3-D printing; Adaptive methods; Collaborative; Collision detection; Design approaches; Force Limiting; Multiple materials; Service robots; Machine design",,,,,,"Cherubini, A., Passama, R., Crosnier, A., Lasnier, A., Fraisse, P., Collaborative manufacturing with physical human-robot interaction (2016) Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 40, pp. 1-13; Matthias, B., Kock, S., Jerregard, H., Kallman, M., Lundberg, I., Safety of collaborative industrial robots: Certification possibilities for a collaborative assembly robot concept (2011) 2011 IEEE International Symposium on Assembly and Manufacturing (ISAM), p. 1; (2011) Robots and Robotic Devices-Safety Requirements for Industrial Robots-Part 1: Robots, ISO/CD 10218-1; (2016) Robots and Robotic Devices-Collaborative Robots, ISO/TS 15066; (2012) Robots and Robotic Devices - Vocabulary, ISO 8373; Kufieta, K., (2014); Sobron, L., Sutanto, D., Pengaruh Posisi Orientasi Objek Pada Proses Rapid Prototyping 3D Printing Terhadap Kekuatan Tarik Material Polymer (2016) Sinergi, 20 (3), p. 229; Thamrin, I., Analisa Tegangan-regangan Struktur Pegas Daun Akibat Modifikasi Penekanan (2009) Jurnal Rekayasa Mesin Universitas Sriwijaya",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

One problem of CS systems is how to design a suitable sensing matrix to improve the signal reconstruction accuracy with the same number of measurements. The recent method to optimize the sensing matrix is by minimizing the mutual coherence of the equivalent dictionary and the amplified sparse representation error (SRE). This paper proposes a new method of sensing matrix optimization by introducing the relative amplified SRE parameter and incorporate it into the optimization problem. The experimental results with test patches and natural images show that the CS system by using the proposed optimized sensing matrix can decrease the mutual coherence and the amplified SRE. The PSNR of reconstructed test patches and natural images for 25% compression ratio are 27.06 dB and 28.32 dB respectively. The results also demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the previous ones in terms of image reconstruction accuracy. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

With biometrics, physical characteristics of a person can be captured and used in the identification process. In this research, facial biometric is used in the verification process to determine whether the user has the authority to access the data or not. Facial biometric is chosen as its low cost implementation and generate quite accurate result for user identification. Face verification system which is adopted in this research is Compressive Sensing (CS) technique, in which aims to reduce dimension size as well as encrypt data in form of facial test image where the image is represented in sparse signals. Encrypted data can be reconstructed using Sparse Coding algorithm. Two types of Sparse Coding namely Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares -ℓp (IRLS-ℓp) will be used for comparison face verification system research. Reconstruction results of sparse signals are then used to find Euclidean norm with the sparse signal of user that has been previously saved in system to determine the validity of the facial test image. Results of system accuracy obtained in this research are 99% in IRLS with time response of face verification for 4.917 seconds and 96.33% in OMP with time response of face verification for 0.4046 seconds with non-optimized sensing matrix, while 99% in IRLS with time response of face verification for 13.4791 seconds and 98.33% for OMP with time response of face verification for 3.1571 seconds with optimized sensing matrix. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Compressive sensing; Face Biometric; face verification system; sensing matrix","Authentication; Biometrics; Codes (symbols); Compressed sensing; Cryptography; Iterative methods; Matrix algebra; Compressive sensing; Face verification systems; Identification process; Iteratively reweighted least squares; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Physical characteristics; User identification; Verification process; Face recognition",,,,,,"Naseem, I., (2010), Person Identification Using Face and Speech Biometrics (University of Western Australia) Doctoral dissertation; Uludag, U., (2006), Secure biometric systems (Michigan State University.

CS provides the joint sensing and compression by exploiting sparsity of the signal in the appropriate sparsifying dictionary. Measurement matrix is used to project the signal and provide a dimensional reduction of the signal. The performance of the CS is determined by the properties of equivalent dictionary that is the multiplication between measurement matrix and specifying dictionary. One of important properties is the averaged mutual coherence which is defined as the average of correlation between the column of the equivalent dictionary. The smaller averaged mutual coherence will provide a better performance of CS, thus optimizing the measurement matrix is how to minimize the averaged mutual coherence. This paper proposes an algorithm to optimize measurement matrix by reducing the averaged mutual coherence based on tight frame design. The results of numerical simulations show that our proposed method improves the performance of the CS system in terms of signal reconstruction accuracy and outperforms the previous algorithms for measurement matrix optimization. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","Averaged mutual coherence; Compressive sensing; Measurement matrix; Tight frame","Environmental engineering; Iterative methods; Numerical methods; Shrinkage; Signal reconstruction; Compressive sensing; Dimensional reduction; Iterative shrinkages; Measurement matrix; Mutual coherence; Number of samples; Reconstruction accuracy; Tight frame; Compressed sensing",,,,,,"Donoho, D.L., Compressed Sensing (2006) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory., 52 (4), pp. 1289-1306. , Apr; Emmanuel, J., Candès, J.R., Tao, T., Robust Uncertainty Principles: Exact Signal Reconstruction From Highly Incomplete Frequency Information (2006) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory., 52 (2), pp. 489-509. , Feb; Candès, E., Romberg, J., Tao, T., Stable signal recovery from incomplete and inaccurate measurements (2006) Comm.

That mechanism is known as compressive sensing/measurements (CS), which provides joint acquisition and compression of the signal. The signal can be represented by using the appropriate dictionary with a few coefficients. In CS, the dictionary must be incoherent with the projection matrix so that the signal can be reconstructed from compressive measurements. Random projections with high probability are incoherent with many dictionaries; therefore, it is often used as a sensing matrix in the CS-based applications. The projection matrix can further be optimized to achieve even smaller mutual coherence than random projections. This paper proposes modification of the recent projection matrix optimization that was based on combining closed-form solution and Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF)-based method.

The CS also provides a mechanism for data security (encryption) because the signal can only be reconstructed if the dictionary and the sensing matrix are known. This technique is better compared to the conventional technique because the compression and encryption is done simultaneously through the signal projection into the sensing matrix. Moreover the signal projection into the sensing matrix is relatively simple and doesn't need heavy computational load so it will be very effective to implement in a portable device. We proposed a scheme of simultaneous image compression-encryption based on CS by using a novel method of optimized sensing matrix. The simulation results showed that by using optimized sensing matrix improved the quality of reconstructed image compared with random sensing matrix that is usually used in CS-based encryption. © 2013 IEEE.","Compressive Sensing; encryption; sensing matrix","Artificial intelligence; Signal reconstruction; Compressive sensing; Computational loads; Conventional techniques; Image encryptions; Portable device; Quality of reconstructed images; Signal projection; Cryptography",,,,,,"Donoho, D.L., (2006) Compressed Sensing, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 52 (4), pp. 1289-1306. , Apr; Candès, E.J., Romberg, J., Tao, T., Robust uncertainty principles: Exact signal reconstruction from highly incomplete frequency information (2006) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 52 (2), pp. 489-509. , Feb; Candès, E., Romberg, J., Tao, T., Stable signal recovery from incomplete and inaccurate measurements (2006) Comm.

The maze is designed with few obstacles that must be avoided by the robot while navigating. A Modified Line-Maze Algorithm is introduced to navigate the robot through the maze and reach a fire lit at different locations on the arena in the form of candles, and will blow it off using a fan. The concepts implemented in this robot are differential drive control, obstacle avoidance, environmental sensing, and electronic circuit design. The sensors used in the robot are PING ultrasonic sensor, infrared ranger, digital compass, and UVTron flame sensor. The robot is being controlled by AVR ATMega128 16 MIPS and is designed according to the rules laid down by, and to compete in the Indonesia Intelligent Robot Contest (KRCI) in 2012. Before the contest, the robot is tested to solve the maze problem and the result shows that the fastest time needed for robot to extinguish the fire and return to its starting point is 48.46 seconds and the false reading has been reduced as high as 99% compared to the previous design [1]. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Fire-fighting robot; Infrared sensor; KRCI; Modified line-maze algoritm; Ultrasonic sensor; UV sensor",,,,,,,"Shuwanto, F., Frederick, Stefen, (2010) Mobile Robot Navigation Using Depth First Search Algorithm, , http://library.binus.ac.id, Retrieved Oct 1, 2011, from e-thesis; (2009) DIKTI, , http://dikti.go.id/index.php?option=com-content&view=article&id= 253:kontes-robot-indonesia-kri-dan-kontes-robotcerdas-indonesia-krci- 2009&catid=143:berita-harian, Irwandi.

Compressive sensing exploits the sparse representations of signals. A signal is considered sparse if it can be represented by few non-zero coefficients using a suitable basis or dictionary. In order to achieve good reconstruction performance from a few number of measurement, compressive sensing requires a small mutual coherence between a measurement matrix and the basis or dictionary. The commonly used measurement matrix is random matrix because it has a small mutual coherence with many basis like Fourier and Wavelet. Note that, random matrix can further be optimized to achieve even smaller mutual coherence. This paper addresses the joint optimization between measurement matrix and sparse dictionary to minimize the average mutual coherence between them. Combination of KSVD and Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) methods are used to perform this joint optimization. The joint optimized measurement matrix was used for image encoding to provide a compressive measurement. The simulation results showed that the joint optimization increases the PSNR of reconstructed image up to 77% and 15% compared to the random matrix and optimized measurement matrix only, respectively. © 2012 IEEE.","compressive sensing; joint optimization; measurement matrix; mutual coherence; sparse dictionary","Compressive sensing; Conventional methods; Fourier; Image encoding; Joint optimization; Measurement matrix; Mutual coherence; Non-zero coefficients; Optimized measurement matrixes; Random Matrix; Reconstructed image; Sampling theory; Signal acquisitions; Signal bandwidth; Sparse representation; Tight frame; Communication; Measurements; Optimization; Signal analysis; Signal reconstruction; Matrix algebra",,,,,,"Donoho, D.L., Compressed Sensing (2006) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 52 (4), pp. 1289-1306. , Apr; Unser, M., Sampling-50 Years after Shannon (2000) Proceedings of the IEEE, 88 (4), pp. 569-587. , Apr; Candes, E.J., Wakin, M.B., An Introduction to Compressive Sampling (2008) IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, pp. 21-30. , March; Emmanuel, J., Candès, J.R., Tao, T., Robust Uncertainty Principles: Exact Signal Reconstruction from Highly Incomplete Frequency Information (2006) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 52 (2), pp. 489-509. , Feb; Candès, E., Romberg, J., Tao, T., Stable signal recovery from incomplete and inaccurate measurements (2006) Comm.

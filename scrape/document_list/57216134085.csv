The lean concept aims to reduce costs and to increase the effectiveness of the supply chain. While the green concept tries to ensure that the ongoing process keeps bringing good effect on the environment. In designing the performance measurement of the sustainable supply chain through the lean & green supply chain management approach, this study includes a formulation for Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and grouping of the lean and green indicators which are integrated with the balanced scorecard (BSC) perspectives. It obtained 28 KPIs which consists of 15 lean supply chain KPIs and 13 green supply chain KPIs. Based on overall weighting, the highest priority KPI is the company's total revenue and total operating costs, followed by the total cost of the supply chain (all of them are from a financial perspective). The weights of three KPIs are 0.103, 0.078 and 0.072 respectively. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","BSC; green; lean; palm oil; SCM; sustainable","Benchmarking; Costs; Operating costs; Palm oil; Balanced scorecards; green; Green supply chain management; Key performance indicators; lean; Performance measurements; sustainable; Sustainable supply chains; Supply chain management",,,,,"McDonald, G., Rahmanulloh, A., Indonesia Oilseeds and Products Annual (2018) 2018 USDA Foreign Agricultural Service; Afriyanti, D., Kroeze, C., Saad, A., Indonesia palm oil production without deforestation and peat conversion by 2050 (2016) Science of the Total Environment, 557-558, pp. 562-570; Lam, W.Y., Kulak, M., Sim, S., King, H., Ma, H., Chaplin-Kramer, R., Greenhouse gas footprints of palm oil production in Indonesia over space and time (2019) Science of the Total Environment, 688, pp. 827-837; Jelsma, I., Slingerland, M., Giller, K.E., Bijman, J., Collective action in a smallholder oil palm production system in Indonesia: The key to sustainable and inclusive smallholder palm oil?

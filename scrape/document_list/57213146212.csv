But at this clinic for the patient registration process is still manual, still recording using the guest book and a guest book for patient four specialist doctors at once. Outpatient book consisting of a piece of paper. Because the problem is to improve the quality of family clinics, it is necessary to have a system of Company Architecture information to support business processes that are suitable to be applied to these healthy family clinics. With data storage using cloud computing. And using a complete and easy Framework, namely TOGAF ADM. TOGAF ADM is one solution that is easy to use in making this system architecture for clear and structured stages. The purpose of this building design is for information system applications that are useful for Healthy Family Clinics. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

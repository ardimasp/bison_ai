Building an efficient mass transportation system is clearly necessary. However, implementing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have also been demonstrated effective in various advanced countries. Recently, the floating vehicle technique (FVT), an ITS implementation, has become cost effective to provide real-time traffic information with proliferation of the smartphones. Although many publications have discussed various issues related to the technique, none of them elaborates the discrepancy of a single floating car data (FCD) and the associated fleet data. This work addresses the issue based on an analysis of Sugiyama et al's experimental data. The results indicate that there is an optimum averaging time interval such that the estimated velocity by the FVT reasonably representing the traffic velocity. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,"Morichi, S., (2005) Journal of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies, 6, p. 1; Nelson, J.D., Blundell, S., Pettitt, P., Thompson, S., (2001) Transport Review, 21, p. 51; Toshitaka, M., (2007) Japan ITS Handbook 2006-2007, , Highway industry development organization; Chen, K., Miles, J.C., (1999) ITS Handbook 2000: Recommendations from the World Road Association (PIARC), , Artech House; Sanwal, K.K., Walrand, J., (1995) California PATH Working Paper UCB-ITS-PWP-95-11, , Tech. rep., University of California, Berkeley; Cathey, F., Dailey, D., Transit vehicles as traffic probe sensors (2001) Proceedings IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems, pp. 579-584; Dai, X., Ferman, M., Roesser, R., A simulation evaluation of a real-time traffic information system using probe vehicles (2003) Intelligent Transportation Systems, 2003, Proceedings. 2003 IEEE, 1; Fabritiis, C.D., Ragona, R., Valenti, G., Traffic estimation and prediction based on real time floating car data (2008) 11th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems; Uno, N., Kurauchi, F., Tamura, H., Iida, Y., (2009) Intelligent Transportation Systems, 13 (2); Liu, K., Yamamoto, T., Morikawa, T., (2009) Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems, 13, p. 16; Herrera, J.C., Work, D.B., Herring, R., Ban, X., Jacobson, Q., Bayen, A.M., (2010) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 18, p. 568; Campolo, C., Iera, A., Molinaro, A., Paratore, S.Y., Ruggeri, G., SMaRTCaR: An integrated smartphone-based platform to support traffic management applications (2012) First International Workshop on Vehicular Traffic Management for Smart Cities (VTM); Jenelius, E., Koutsopoulos, H.N., (2013) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 53, p. 64; Rahmani, M., Koutsopoulos, H.N., (2013) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 30, p. 41; Sugiyama, Y., Fukui, M., Kikuchi, M., Hasebe, K., Nakayama, A., Nishinari, K., Ichi Tadaki, S., Yukawa, S., (2008) New Journal of Physics, 10, p. 033001; De Boor, C., (2001) A Practical Guide to Splines, , Springer Verlag; De Lillo, F., Cecconi, F., Lacorata, G., Vulpiani, A., (2008) EPL, 84; De Luca, L.T., (2009) Propulsion Physics, , (EDP Sciences, Les Ulis","Gunawan, F.E.; Bina Nusantara University, 11480 Jakarta, Indonesia; email: fgunawan@binus.edu",,"","EDP Sciences","2013 International Conference on Advances Science and Contemporary Engineering, ICASCE 2013","23 October 2013 through 24 October 2013","Jakarta",,21016275,,,,"English","EPJ Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901428304

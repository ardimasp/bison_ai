The game application called AR Virtual Pet Simulator is a simulator game which uses Augmented Reality technology to display a virtual pet, for the purpose of enhancing the users' experience. Users can also interact by using application to understand the daily behaviours of pets. Application development methods are carried out starting from gathering requirements, design, implementation, to testing and evaluation. Results from the end evaluation shows that the application was well-liked by users and it could help users in knowing how to take care of pets, but the experience of using the application is not the same as having a pet in the real world. Conclusion gathered from the research is that applications with virtual pets are not able to entirely replace real pets but are able to provide knowledge on taking care of pets. Where users cannot interact directly with pets. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Android (operating system); Augmented reality; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Simulators; User experience; Android platforms; Application development; Augmented reality technology; Interactive technology; Real-world; Testing and evaluation; Users' experiences; Virtual reality",,,,,"Martono, K.T., Pengembangan Game dengan Menggunakan Game Engine Game Maker (2015) Jurnal Sistem Komputer, 5, pp. 23-30; (2018) Global Market Share Held by Smartphone Operating Systems, 2009-2018, by Quarter [Online], , https://www.statista.com/statistics/266136/global-market-share-held-by-smartphone-operating-systems/, Statista Diakses 8 Mei 2019 dar; Saputra, Y.A., Implementasi Augmented Reality (AR) pada Fosil Purbakala di Museum Geologi Bandung (2014) Jurnal Ilmiah Komputer Dan Informatika (KOMPUTA), 1, pp. 1-8; Craig, A.B., (2013) Understanding Augmented Reality Concepts and Applications; Caesar, R., Kajian Pustaka Perkembangan Genre Games dari Masa ke Masa (2015) Journal of Animation and Games Studies, 1, pp. 113-134; (2018), https://www.wepc.com/news/video-game-statistics/, WePC Worldwide Unit Sales of the Best Selling PC Games of All Times in Millions Units (January 2018) [Online].

Information technology provide many social media which is causing the leaked of personal information where abductor can find out the information. Using social media, people can share location, life event, and anything related about their life event, these become the useful information for the abductor. To anticipate this, a lot of personal tracking device is developed, but the response is too late. Because, the family or relative of the victims will notice that abduction had happen after the victim is lost. According to the problem, this research will focus on develop the personal tracking device which trigger by the victims who own the phone based on android and web application. Whenever the abduction happens, the victim just need to click the button and the system will send a message to the relatives and family in their contact also trigger the notification to the local security.

Augmented reality can provide the necessary functions and information in its application. In this case the augmented reality (AR) just need a tool like a camera that can capture images by detecting the object without the marker coordinates from the surrounding environment to make real 3D objects. Augmented Reality application development is simple and easy to develop, so it can serve as a promotional tool or the provision of information. Therefore, the notion obtained separately develop AR applications that help the residence marketing department in the home market to show a 3D object of marketed house.

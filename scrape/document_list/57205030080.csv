With millions of thousands of sellers every day, it is a challenge for Merchant Development (MD) teams to educate sellers, both new and reputable. The problem faced today is the lack of centralized learning information that sellers need to develop their stores. The MD team is also difficult to help improve the quality and sales of sellers in Tokopedia massively. Today, they rely more heavily on city-To-city offline activities to acquire new sellers and provide seller training in every city. Tokopedia requires a Knowledge Management System to accommodate the information needs of the seller and increase the scalability of information dissemination from the MD team. This research will analyze the problem in more detail using best practice from Asian Productivity Organization (APO) to see Tokopedia internal readiness in developing KMS and map information requirement from seller. Data collection through distributing questionnaires to sellers from all categories of sales and to all teams involved with KMS development that will be named Seller Education. © 2018 IEEE.","KMS design; knowledge; knowledge management; knowledge management system; seller education","Information dissemination; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Surveys; Best practices; Data collection; Indonesia; Information requirement; knowledge; Knowledge management system; Offline; Human resource management",,,,,"Emarketer, (2017) Pengguna Internet Indonesia Nomor Enam Dunia, , July; Debowski, S., (2005) Knowledge Management, pp. 13273-13275. , John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

The impact of this project during construction makes the road narrowing and causes longer queue length and delay of Harmoni Intersection, and vehicle travel time passes the site of construction. This research aims to determine traffic management and modeling using VISSIM, Indonesian Highway Capacity Manual (MKJI) 1997, and Indonesian Highway Capacity Guidance (PKJI) 2014 on Harmony Central. The value of queue length, delay, and travel time obtained from the existing condition will be used to estimate the traffic performance during construction. The increased queue length, delay, and travel time along the construction site will cause congestion to the previous intersection. The diversion plan needs to be done before the vehicle meets the busway flow that will be diverted caused by the relocation of the terminal to reduce the density of vehicles going into the Signalized Intersection Harmoni. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","MKJI 1997; MRT Construction Phase II; PKJI 2014; Road Diversion; Traffic Management; VISSIM","Highway engineering; Highway traffic control; Queueing theory; Road vehicles; Roads and streets; Traffic congestion; Travel time; Construction phase; MKJI 1997; PKJI 2014; Traffic management; VISSIM; Highway administration",,,,,"Santosa, W., Basuki, T., Gunawan, S.U., Tinjauan Atas Proyek MRT Jakarta (2001) Simposium ke-4 FSTPT; Soehodho, S., Public transportation development and traffic accident prevention in Indonesia (2017) IATSS Research, 40 (2), pp. 76-80; (2009) Kajian Dampak Lalu Lintas Pra Konstruksi Mass Rapid Transit, , PT.

Through the application of medical records that have good quality will affect the level of service to patients. Utilization of a good medical record management system, the orderly administration of health services becomes effective and efficient. In this research, the proposed systems are web-based and mobile application. The scope of the design evaluated is architectural design, flow chart design, data flow diagram design, database design and system interface design. The beginning of this research using exploratory method to make confirmation involving 5 doctors and nurses working in hospitals in Jakarta, and 72 road patients who are being treated. This study also involved IT consultants at the Hospital Accreditation Commission as a resource person who understood the problem of integrating the medical record system at the hospital. Data was collected through the distribution of questionnaires during the period January - April 2020. The objective of this research is to propose medical record information system that can improve input and output problems in the patient registration process, speed of service, medical record data processing and ease of tracking medical record information. © 2020 IEEE.","E-health; Healthcare; M-health; Smart healthcare system","Data flow graphs; Data handling; Flowcharting; Hospitals; Information management; Medical problems; Patient treatment; Surveys; Data flow diagrams; Health services; Input and outputs; Level of Service; Medical record systems; Mobile applications; Patient registration; System-interface design; Medical information systems",,,,,"(2009) Undang-Undang Republik Indonesia Nomor 36 Tahun 2009, , Jakarta; (2018) Kementrian Kesehatan Republik Indonesia.

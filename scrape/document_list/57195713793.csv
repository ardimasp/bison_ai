One of the old buildings is in Lasem city, not only functioning as residential, but also as a batik business place. Problem statement of this research is how colonial old residential building has sustainable system? The objective of this research are to know what kind of sustainable system applied in old colonial building, and to know how Lasem old building analysed by Vitruvius theory. This research is using qualitative method, using one Lasem colonial residential as a study case. The house as will be analysed whether it meets the requirements as sustainable building, or it also meets the criteria of a good building according to Vitruvius theory by meeting the firmity, utility and venustas. The result of this study, this building is both a sustainable building and also meets what is contained in Vitruvius theory. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","colonial building; Lasem; residential; sustainable concept; Vitruvius theory","Intelligent buildings; Sustainable development; Technology transfer; Lasem; Qualitative method; residential; Residential building; Sustainable building; sustainable concept; Sustainable systems; Vitruvius theory; Housing",,,,,"Soekiman, J., (2011) Kebudayaan Indis: Dari Zaman Kompeni Sampai Revolusi; Wardani, Gaya Desain Kolonial Belanda pada Interior Gereja Katolik Hati Kudus Yesus Surabaya (2009) Surabaya: Jurnal Dimensi Interior, 7, pp. 52-64; Handinoto, (1996) Perkembangan Kota Dan Arsitektur Kolonial Belanda di Surabaya 1870-1940; Rachmayanti, S., Cultural Acculturation in Interior and Architecture of Old Straits Born Chinese Lasem House (2017) Jakarta: Humaniora Journal, 8, pp. 279-290; Sudarwani, M., Penerapan Green Architecture dan Green Building sebagai Upaya Pencapaian Sustainable Architecture (2013) Majalah Ilmiah Universitas Pandanaran, 10; Gracia, A., (2016) Architecture Yang Baik Belajar Dari Vitruvius, , https://www.arsitag.com/blog/arsitektur-yang-baik-belajar-dari-vitruviu, Downloaded on August 27 taken from website","Rachmayanti, S.; Interior Design Department, Indonesia; email: srachmayanti@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Traditional Batak Toba House Architecture is a vernacular architecture that grows and develops from the local wisdom of ethnic communities and anchors on tradition, and is built by craftsmen based on experience (trial and error), using local techniques and materials and is an answer to the environmental settings where the building is located and always open to transformation. When building a Batak Toba traditional house, local people still understand the natural environment around the ecosystem. But in its current development, Batak Toba traditional community homes have undergone many changes, both in the form, space and use of ornaments and building materials. As a step so that the traditions of local wisdom are not extinct, it is necessary to preserve and apply the traditional forms and ornaments to the architecture of the Catholic Church as an effort to sustain the traditional architecture. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Batak Toba; Preserve; Sustain; Traditional house","Houses; Batak Toba; Ethnic community; Natural environments; Preserve; Sustain; Traditional architecture; Traditional house; Vernacular architecture; Architecture",,,,,"Mangunwijaya, Y.B., (2013) Wastu Citra; Wiranto, Arsitektur Vernakular Indonesia: Perannya Dalam Pengembangan Diri (1999) Jurnal Dimensi Teknik Arsitektur, 27, pp. 15-20; (2019) Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia, , KBBI; Roberts, C., (2013) Design Thinking, Process and Methods Manual; Simamora, T., (1997) Rumah Batak Toba Usaha Inkulturasi; Napitupulu, D.S., (1997) Arsitektur Tradisional Daerah Sumatera Utara; Sumartono, (2017) Metode Penelitian Kualitatif.; Sitindjak, R., Studi Ikonologi Panofsky pada Arsitektur dan Interior Gereja Katolik Inkulturatif Pangururan (2011) Jurnal Desain Interior Dimensi Interior, 9, pp. 119-136; Saragih, D.A., Yulianto Pakpahan, R., Kajian Ornamen Gorga di Rumah Adat Batak Toba (2019) Jurnal Arsitektur Alur, 2, pp. 1-14; De, S., Pengenalan Motif Gorga Singa Singa menggunakan Teknik Sublime Printing (2018) Atrat, Visual Art and Design Journal, 6, pp. 1-12","Roesli, C.; Interior Design Department, Indonesia; email: croesli@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The study aimed to determine the relationship between hypertension and diabetes mellitus risk factors and dependence on assistance with activities of daily living in chronic stroke patients. The study used an analytical observational cross-sectional design. The study's sample included 44 stroke patients selected using the quota sampling method. The relationship between the variables was analyzed using the bivariate chi-squared test and multivariate logistic regression. Based on the chi-squared test, the relationship between the Modified Shah Barthel Index (MSBI) score and hypertension and diabetes mellitus as stroke risk factors, were p = 0.122 and p = 0.002, respectively. The logistic regression results suggest that hypertension and diabetes mellitus are stroke risk factors related to the MSBI score: p = 0.076 (OR 4.076; CI 95% 0.861-19.297) and p = 0.007 (OR 22.690; CI 95% 2.332-220.722), respectively. Diabetes mellitus is the most prominent risk factor of severe dependency on assistance with activities of daily living in chronic stroke patients. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Dentistry; Regression analysis; Activities of Daily Living; Barthel indices; Chi-Squared test; Cross-sectional design; Diabetes mellitus; Logistic regressions; Multivariate logistic regressions; Sampling method; Patient rehabilitation",,,,,"http://tinyurl.com/jfymnng, WHO 2008 Fact Sheet: The Top Ten Causes of Death.

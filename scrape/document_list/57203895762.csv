Data is distributed to 300 respondents, processed using cluster analysis and simple regression. The results showed four segmentations (Smart shopper, Impulsive shopper, Aesthetic shopper, and Comfortable shopper). Another result shown that one out of four segments had a positive and significant influence that was popularity claim towards online impulsive buying decisions. © 2020 IEEE.","Collectivist culture; Online impulsive buying; Popularity claim; Segmentation","Budget control; Cluster analysis; Competition; Electronic commerce; Information management; Buying decisions; Indonesia; Online commerce; Online media; Price competition; Promotion budgets; Shopping behavior; Consumer behavior",,,,"026/VR

One who managed to save himself in times of crisis caused a panic of buying that happens a lot in retail stores.

Companies can explore these insights through sentiments formed from social media user posts on social media platforms. This research explores consumer sentiment related to panic purchases using qualitative analysis with NVivo software. The results of a study of 647 posts on Twitter microblogging revealed that panic buying contained negative attitude.

The description of the inhabitants' experiences on applying technics to create vernacular floating houses is considered as significant knowledge to develop advance technology on the basis of local characteristic. Vernacular floating houses resilience consists of natural experiences of inhabitants in adapting their daily activities to the characteristic of local climate. By using qualitative approach, the Rumah Rakit inhabitants' verbal information in this article becomes the main aspect in exploring local knowledge. At the end, the conceptual model of vernacular Rumah Rakit in Seberang Ulu 1, Palembang is formulated, in terms of building architectural tectonic that is closely related to the local climate characteristic.

One of the horticultural commodities is the potato (Solanum tuberosum). Potatoes are widely used as ingredients in the light meal industry such as potato chips. Restaurants and fast food industry also use potatoes as the ingredients. Wonosobo regency is one of the areas in Java producing a lot of potatoes and the majority of the population work as farmers. The purpose of this research is to find out the network design of potato supply chain in Wonosobo regency in order to design a more effective and efficient one. This research uses the descriptive qualitative method and the processes of collecting data are observation, interview, and documentation. The results suggest that the current supply chain design of potatoes is from farmers, middlemen, retailers, and consumers. An alternative network design proposed is the farmers should channel the lower quality potatoes directly to the retailers. While another alternative is, for the good quality potatoes, the farmers should sell them to cooperative for export. © 2018 Authors.","Design; Export; Indonesia; Potato; Supply chain; Wonosobo regency",,,,,,,"Chopra, S., Sodhi, M.S., Managing risk to avoid supply chain breakdown (2004) MIT Sloan Management Review; Chopra, S., Meindl, P., (2001) Supply Chain Management: Strategy, Planning, and Operations, , New Jersey: Prentice Hall; Deep, A., Dani, S., Managing Global Food Supply Chain Risks: A Scenario Planning Perspective (2009) POMS 20th Annual Conference, , Orlando, Florida, POMS Abstract Number: 011-0371; Diaz, L.C., Hansel, J.E., Making Risk sharing models work with farmers, agribusinesses and financial institutions (2007) International Conference on Rural Finance Research: Moving Results into Policies and Practice, pp. 1-55. , FAO.

A phenomenon that emerged lately is the millennial moms are busy uploading photos of their children in such a way they dress through various social media like Facebook, Instagram, and Path. Although Millennials form a potential market segment, but Millennials is not a homogeneous group, so that millennial moms' shopping behavior can not be uniform due to the diversity of characteristics, both demographic and psychographic. To that end, it is important for marketers, especially kids apparel retailer, to divide this market into segments that are more specific, so that each segment can obtain a different treatment from marketers. The purpose of this study was to establish a kids apparel market segmentation based on the behavior of the millennial moms and determine whether there are differences in demographic characteristics between the segments formed, to eventually be able to provide recommendations for marketers of kids apparel retailer in Jakarta related to the differences in the character of the segments exist. Data was collected by survey method through questionnaires which are distributed to 306 people millennial moms in Jakarta. The analysis technique used is Cluster Analysis and Multiple Discriminant Analysis. Results from this study stated that there are 4 segments formed, namely shopping maniac moms, buy whatever moms, too much thinking moms, and reasonable choice-making moms, where there are significant differences in shopping behavior among the four segments.

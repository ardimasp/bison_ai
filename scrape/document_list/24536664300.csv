The Enterprise Architecture Planning (EAP) design was created to support business policy in achieving the vision and mission of local governments. The purpose of designing this enterprise architecture model is to create harmony between the needs of government administration, business needs, and the information technology used. The method used in this research is qualitative by collecting data through the website, the regional parliament information system application survey and also conducting literature studies from previous research. The architectural design in this study uses a standardized framework and approach for architectural and government application models (SAGA) for e-government applications. This architectural model will map every need for government information systems in the form of a display/interface. The results that will be presented for the architectural design of this regional parliament are the data design model, hardware architecture design and information technology design. © 2021 ICIC International","EAP; Government; Information systems; Information technology; Regional parliament",,,,,,,,"Sudarman, P., Political communication strategies of Paslon in the 2015 Pilkada simultaneously (Strategi Komunikasi Politik Paslon Dalam Pilkada Serentak 2015) (2017) Prolistik Journal, 2, pp. 121-134; Prasetyo, T.

HRIS and MEIS are systems that support each other in data and information related to personnel. The development of an integrated model of HRIS and MEIS based on the TOGAF ADM framework is carried out to meet organizational needs, with efficiency in personnel, budget, equipment, and infrastructure. This model shows the optimization of the existing system. Various things can be done regarding the career of military personnel based on expertise, education, experience, service, and professionalism, as well as the placement of military personnel for various forms of assignments, both operations and staff, which are tactical or strategic. The system development is carried out because various forms of assignment require the accuracy of military personnel in the right position. © 2021 ICIC International","HRIS; MEIS; Military career pattern; Military education; Military organization; Military personnel; TOGAF",,,,,,,,"Murray, N., The role of professional military education in mission command (2014) Jt.

MRI images of brain tumors have quite high complexity both from variable size and structure, low contrast, bad boundaries, and low homogeneity. In some cases noise appears like blur, miss focus, and miss alignment of images. Manually image segmentation requires high accuracy, since each pixel contains important information. In addition, it will potentially lead to different interpretations of each expert. The tools that are used by experts to read MRI images of the brain nowadays, can present images into several regions namely sagittal, coronal, and cross sectional. The division into these three regions is actually quite helpful during the diagnosis process, since the doctor can see the brain tissue in the three regions, but the display cannot lead to an object that is found slightly different from particular area or focus on one particular object or area that shows a difference or abnormality. The expected outcome of this initial research is an architecture design for segmenting MRI images of brain tumors by involving two algorithms, MDWT and CNN. Combination both of MDWT and CNN provides new approaches in medical images analysis including brain image tumor segmentation. Researchers use literature study and laboratory experiment as the research methods.

The approach that used to enhance the sports organizations is sports science, which is a concept that contributes to the development of athletes by collaborating in many fields and studies, such as anatomy, physiology, psychology, engineering, chemistry, etc. The approach of Sport science articulates the technology that blended on all of the approached. Currently, the use of sports technology or science in Indonesia is also very low in all sports categories. Usually, the management and coaches look at player statistics based on manual data or reports to view player statistics periodically. There is still a lack of exploration to use player statistics to be used by coaches to improve the ability of the players and the organization. This research will propose how to develop sports science with a business intelligence approach that used the Kimball data mart approach as decision support in the field of sports so that management and coaches can apply the correct approach to improve the capacity of players and organizational development.

The purpose of this research is to recognize fraudulent transactions on debit cards with development of the Enhanced Auxiliary Classifier-Generative Adversarial Network (EAC-GAN) model which is a development of Auxiliary Classifier-Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN) model. EAC-GAN uses AC-GAN, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and tuning parameter to recognize fraud transactions in debit cards and increase F1-Score. SMOTE is used to overcome imbalanced data in debit card transactions dataset. Then PCA is required to reduce dimension of the dataset and to know which factors are influential in explaining the phenomenon in the dataset while maintaining characteristics of the data. Parameter tuning is useful to achieve the best F1-Score in training and testing the EAC-GAN model. This research also explores the study of AC-GAN and Convolutional Neural Network 2 Dimension (CNN2D) performance. The result of this research describes that EAC-GAN model beats CNN2D done in the previous research. F1-Score for EAC-GAN is 74% and F1-Score generated by the CNN2D model is 35%. Conclusion from this research is that EAC-GAN model works better in fraud transaction in debit cards surpassing CNN2D model. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The problem is the large numbers of vehicles can cause limitation of the parking lots especially in malls or other public places. Usually people driving around the whole parking lots to find the available ones. when the parking lots are all full, driver must search for other places to park their vehicle immediately. Designing the Smart Parking Finder has the purpose of making it easier for users to get available parking spaces and showing the location of the existing parking lot. On the other hand, it also facilitates the search for parking lots, but can reduce the search time for parking lots, and can also save fuel. For now, the application is still for some parking lots at the mall that have collaborated.

Cashless Transaction exists because of fast majorities of human transaction evolved towards digital environment, this creates an opportunity where legal money exists, recorded, and exchanged in digital form. Thus cashless transaction will make less effort in currency operation cost, keep on track with expenses, connected anytime everywhere as long as connected with internet, and eliminates the needs of banknotes or receipt. Cashless Transaction have done over the past few years making life easier by reducing a number of objects to merge into 1 functional object that could make payments faster and simpler starting with check the first mark of cashless transaction that's still being used nowadays, but cashless transaction doesn't stop evolving in this modern era where money is demonetized, cashless transaction is moving into the digital grid resulting a breakthrough mobile wallets and online transfer that offers people flexibility because its technology advancement makes it possible to make payments anytime and anywhere since it's only depend on a secure network(internet) and a platform, therefore cashless transaction could be done as fast as possible saving precious time. Cashless transaction has some of key components such as security, UX, Functionality, Performance and Data Integrity. Five key components could make cashless transaction become reality but also poses a different threat to cashless transaction. Hacking is one of them. Hacking could be done by anyone that have the ability to compromise the transmission, the transmission needs to have more data protection thus the cashless transaction could be done safely and free of risk. © 2020 ACM.","Breakthrough; Cashless transaction; Compromise; Connected; Digital environment; Digital grid; Evolved; Expenses; Hacking; Key components; Merge; Operation cost; Reality","Personal computing; Security of data; Data integrity; Digital environment; Digital information; Electronic representations; Financial transactions; Functional object; Secure networks; Technology advancement; Electronic document exchange",,,,,,,"https://shodhgangotri.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/123456789/4546/1/synopsis.pdf; https://www.quora.com/What-is-cashless-Transaction; https://www.quora.com/What-Are-The-Advantages-of-cashless-Transaction; https://www.quora.com/What-is-The-meaning-of-A-cashless-Transaction; https://dzone.com/articles/5-key-elements-of-digital-payment-systems; https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316429963_Cashless_transaction_Modes_advantages_and_disadvantages; https://www.charteredclub.com/cashless-payment/; Definition of Hacking | What is Hacking ?

In this paper, we employed the Bass model for a new product that used the sensor technology diffusion from the perspective of the Wagner-Whitin lot-sizing model which discusses this matter related to suitability of sensor technology on the market and operational dimensions. The objective of this study is to propose an uncertain fuzzy approach to specify the new product that applied the sensor technology introduction's optimum time, price, production scheduling, and rate simultaneously. This model will be applied to analyze the impact of sensor technology diffusion on the market acceptance and some operational parameters, for instance, total customer population, price elasticities, startup and maintenance costs, the unit's variable cost and research and development costs on optimized benefit, and the product's optimized lifespan. In this experiment, we have inspiration from the version of the Sale et al. (2017) model which considers uncertainty by using fuzzy triangular numbers and performing the alpha cut method. Moreover, in this research, variable cost is considered as a Cobb-Douglas function. Initially, in Research Methodology, mathematical modeling is applied, wherein utilizing simulation and the experimental design method, data were generated. Eventually, using LINGO optimization software, the problem was solved, and for further examinations considering the existence of various parameters, design of experiment (DoE) by Design-Expert 8 software and response surface methodology was adopted to analyze and optimize the problem's parameters. The results indicated that the objective function's climax occurs when the higher limit of alpha being 0.7 is assumed; hence, the optimum state of demand belongs to this amount of alpha. © 2020 Ford Lumban Gaol and Tokuro Matsuo.",,"Cost accounting;

To support the company's business processes, XYZ uses two applications to carry out operational activities, namely the CARTOS application to manage invoices and the Finance application to record company costs and revenues. To produce a cost accounting report, XYZ is still processing and visualizing it manually with data sources from the two applications mentioned earlier. This resulted in quite a long time processing data into information. So that reporting to management cannot be done in real time. Therefore XYZ needs a system that can help management to analyze and manage data into information in real time. The Business Intelligence (BI) method is one of the solutions for company needs, especially in analyzing and providing access to data to help make better decisions. This study discusses the design and implementation of business intelligence solutions ranging from architecture, data warehouse, ETL processes and visualization in the form of a dashboard in accordance with the needs of XYZ. The method used in developing business intelligence dashboards refers to the executive information system life cycle method which consists of justification, planning, business analysis, design, construction, and dissemination. The results of this research are dashboard visualization using the Power BI tool that displays information and knowledge needed in the monitoring process and becomes material to produce management decisions related to cost accounting reports. © 2021 F.

Educators and institutions are unsure which digital content is the most appropriate to improve a student’s skills. For this study, an experimental design method using a control-group pretest-posttest was conducted to compare learning outcomes through the implementation of digital content in blended learning for computer programming. The instrument used was a programming case. The factor and level tested included various digital content types, and the desired response was an increment in learning outcomes. This study concludes that there is a significant increment in the average scores of groups that are using Ebooks in blended learning—not video as many educators may think. Results of this study include a recommendation for educators and institutions in applying and determining which digital content is the most appropriate to improve students’ programming skills in blended learning. © Common Ground Research Networks, Budi Yulianto, Harjanto Prabowo, Raymond Kosala, Ford Lumban Gaol, All Rights Reserved.

The fact, many companies have failed to implement ERP which is proven to be not go live on time, so that the implementation value is to be very expensive. For this reason, it is important to consider other methods that can reduce failures in implementing ERP that are reviewed from the perspective of readiness assessment. Based on previous research, there are some challenging on the ERP readiness assessment. We also found that some areas on the ERP readiness that still not explore more serious such as ERP and agile method. Therefore, based on the challenging and open are on the ERP readiness, we will explore more development the framework of ERP readiness assessment using agile parameters to help the industry. The purpose of this research is to identify gaps and propose improvements which are the weaknesses in order to improve performance of the organization. The result of this research is developing the framework using an agile parameter for determination of the ERP readiness assessment with a case study in the textile industry in Indonesia. Hopefully, this research has contribution as a measurement tool for assessing the organizational readiness in order to increase agility in the industry. This research methodology uses the combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods using the NVivo software as a result of FGD data processing and using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity (TOPSIS) for validation and verification tests. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

A problem often encountered is the difficulty in formalizing and articulating the knowledge, and for this reason, a media is required to extract into an easily translated form. This study focuses on explicit forms of knowledge, and as a result, the method employed is the collection of research findings related to tacit knowledge and community learning. Also, these findings were surveyed based on predetermined keywords and analysed into a complete report which can be used as material for decision making especially in the matter of sharing this knowledge in community-based learning. The purpose of this study was to determine the understanding of measuring this knowledge in terms of existing dimensions, such as technical and cognitive. However, in this case, the conditions and processes help inform about tacit with reference to the Community. The survey activity is still limited to its conceptual measurement and has not yet led to implementation in the form of community learning where members can interact directly using text, images, videos and other forms. In addition to using two dimensions of measurement, knowledge can be shared through socialization, externalization, combination and internalization that refer to the Nonaka and Ba models for learning to provide a sense of fun for the community group. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Community learning; Survey; Tacit knowledge",,,,,,,,"Ozmen, F., (2010) The Capabilities of the Educational Organizations in Making Use of Tacit Knowledge, 9, pp. 1860-1865; Fullan, M., The Role of Leadership in the Promotion of Knowledge Management in Schools, , OECD Conference (18–19 March 2002).

Reasons for educational institutions to use cloud computing as a means of learning include cloud service providers providing sizable hardware and software resources, so educational institutions do not have to pay a large amount of money to buy hardware and software as an investment. But as long as this online learning system runs there will definitely be risks, for example performance problems from internet network connections. This study aims to discuss this problem. Methodology/approach In this study, firstly identifying dangerous or harmless activities to the activities carried out in cloud computing, then determining the impact, aspects, likelihood and severity of risks, and finally determining the level of risk from these activities using a risk matrix. Finding- By using a risk register in the learning system, risk analysis and evaluation can show the Incident, Cause, impact, risk type, risk category, aspect, likelihood, severity, and risk level for each dangerous or non-hazardous activity. Originality/value - The tools used to measure the level of risk for dangerous or non-hazardous activities for the learning system can be used for more extensive research aimed at measuring institutional-level risks in the education sector © 2019 IEEE.","learning system; risk assessment; risk level; risk register","Cloud computing; E-learning; Engineering education; Hazards; Online systems; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Analysis and evaluation; Cloud service providers; Educational institutions; Hardware and software; Network connection; On-line learning systems; Performance problems; Service facilities; Learning systems",,,,,,,"Huth, A., Cebula, J., (2011) The Basics of Cloud Computing, pp. 1-4; Gholami, A., Laure, E., (2015) Security and Privacy of Sensitive Data in Cloud Computing : A Survey of Recent Developments, pp. 131-150; Mahesh, (2016) Data Security and Security Controls in Cloud Computing, pp. 11-13; Esposito, C., Castiglione, A., (2017) Challenges of Connecting Edge and Cloud Computing : A Security and Forensic Perspective, pp. 13-17; Shareeful, I., Fenz, S., Weippl, E., Mouratidis, H., (2017) A Risk Management Framework for Cloud Migration Decision Support; Kozlov, A.D., Noga, N.L., Risk management for information security of corporate information systems using cloud technology (2018) Elev.

It takes a place that can channel the hidden knowledge into new knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to find out the mapping of community learning in informal education to support learning communities. Some of the previous studies of Learning Community were able to create smart, skilled, independent and competitiveness communities with learning programs at formal education. The internet community and media make a distance not an obstacle for people who exchange ideas. The power of bonding makes people help each other like families who have the same responsibilities. Community-based learning becomes an alternative in the future, where conventional learning will gradually be abandoned. Learning Community in the context of informal education is an alternative for busy individuals and it is difficult to find time to share knowledge. The method used is by survey method by defining the scope in detail, and determining the research question; do a search that involves selecting literary sources based on keywords, and determine inclusion and exclusion criteria to sort the types of references for further exploration. Community-based learning has unique things related to the learning process that is not possessed by formal education, among others, the interaction between community members, collaboration in sharing knowledge, quick feedback in solving problems, and self-reflection that often expresses opinions. unthinkable, the creation of actualization, problem-solving and learning by doing as well as learning community learning can also be done with experience-based learning. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Surveys; Community learning; Experience-based learning; Explicit knowledge; Inclusion and exclusions; Informal educations; Internet communities; Learning community; Research questions; E-learning",,,,,,,"Zavratnik, V., Kos, A., Stojmenova Duh, E., Smart villages: Comprehensive review of initiatives and practices (2018) Sustainability, 10 (7), p. 2559; Haron, H., Aziz, N.H.N., Harun, A., A conceptual model participatory engagement within e-learning community (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 116, pp. 242-250; Mundschenk, N.A., Fuchs, W.W., Professional learning communities: An effective mechanism for the successful implementation and sustainability of response to intervention (2016) SRATE Journal, 25 (2), pp. 55-64; Iverson, J.O., McPhee, R.D., Knowledge management in communities of practice: Being true to the communicative character of knowledge (2002) Management Communication Quarterly, 16 (2), pp. 259-266; Crowe, K., D'Andrade, A., Engaging community members in providing support for the dying and the bereaved: Activities in social work community practice (2018) Families in Society, 99 (4), pp. 338-346; Keeble, L., Loader, B., Community informatics (2001) Community Informatics.

The evaluated exertion in the UCP method gets from the increase between the UCP esteem and the Effort Value (ER). The expense of ER is the extent of structure of working hours required for each utilization. Determination of ER values only uses data software development projects with simple linear regression analysis. However, most researchers refer to the proposed ER value without questioning or reviewing the ER value. This study evaluates the ER values for software development projects in the business field, namely the Health Surveillance Application. In conducting this research, we need several data on software development projects in the Health Surveillance field from this data. We can find the ER value by analyzing correlation and linear equations. The final results of this study get the benefit of ER 8.0. This price is lower than the quantity suggested by past scientists. Decreasing the ER value can reduce the estimated amount of the effort, then the decrease in estimated business value will reduce the resources needed for software development. May be due to a development project as a component or framework that facilitates project developmen, this is possible for several reasons, including more advanced software engineering technology, rapid growth. © 2019 IEEE.","health surveillance application; Size of software; software metrics; use case point","Application programs; Computer aided software engineering; Health; Monitoring; Regression analysis; Business value; Development project; Health surveillances; Simple linear regression analysis; Software development projects; Software metrics; Use case points; Working hours; Software design",,,,,,,"https://www.maxmanroe.com/ini-penyebab-kegagalan-startupmenurut-dua-tokoh-startup-indonesia.html; Group, S., (2011) Reports of Chaos, , http:/standishgroup.com/news, Accessed on 1 June 2013; Tokey, Steve, Steve, (2010) Software Return: Maximizing Your Software Investment Return, , Prentice-Hall; Galorath, D., Evans, M.W., (2008) Sizing Software, Estimate, and Risk Management, , Auerbach, in; Endy, M., (2011) Estimated Project of Software, , http:/software.endy.muhardin.com/estimate-probesoftware/, Retrieved March 7, 2013; Ochodek, M., Nawrocki, J., Kwarciak, K., (2011) Simplifying Estimation Effort Based on Use Case Points, , Sciencedirect; Karner, G., (1993) Resource Estimation for Objectory Projects, , Objective System SF AB; Clemmons, R.K., (2006) Use Case Point Project Estimation, , Technical Services Diversified, Inc; https://mx.123dok.com/document/7q01eggzsoftware-projects-effort-estimation-using-use-case-points-method-in-the-context-of-project-management-bodyof-knowledge, Retrieved from; http://elearning.upnjatim.ac.id/courses/REKAYASAPERANGKATLUNAKPAGI/document/slidekuliah/Software_Process_Model_1.ppt?cidReq=REKAYASAPERANGKATLUNAKPAGI, Accessed on July 12, 2013; Robiola, G., Ricardo, O., (2008) Using Case to Early Estimate Effort with Simpler Metrics, , Springer publishing house London Limited; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_Case_Points#Unadjusted_Use_Case_Weight_(UUCW)_2",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","4th International Conference on Informatics and Computing, ICIC 2019","23 October 2019 through 24 October 2019",,157590,,9781728122076,,,"English","Proc.

Data from the satellite usually have lower accuracy than other expensive methods e.g. drone, aerial view, etc. However, the data from satellite have wide range area and sufficient enough for modeling a land use. The accuracy assessment, therefore, becomes a vital task to ensure the model from the satellite imagery meets the minimum requirement. Validating the classification result by comparing to the real location or by other higher resolution images is needed. The paper proposed additional validation by comparing the classification result by another result in different date through the cross-tabulation method. Two satellite imageries in the same year were processed before classification to get the land-use and land-cover classification. Comparing two land-use classified images gave the accuracy statistics using cross-tabulation. The kappa statistic and accuracy showed the classification performance of 0.7592 that similar to the sampling-based accuracy assessment (0.75390). Therefore, the proposed method was appropriate as the accuracy assessment. © 2019 IEEE.","cross-tabulation; kappa statistic; land-use classification; satellite imagery","Antennas; Land use; Satellite imagery; Accuracy measurements; Classification performance; Classification results; cross-tabulation; Higher resolution images; Kappa statistic; Land-use and land cover classifications; Landuse classifications; Image classification",,,,,,,"Handayanto, R., Tripathi, N.K., Kim, S.M., Herlawati, H., Land use growth simulation and optimization for achieving a sustainable urban form (2018) TELKOMNIKA (Telecommunication Comput.

However, media ecology has been drastically reconfigured by the emergence of social media. In this study, we use Twitter follower data to build an online news media network that represents the pattern of news consumption in Twitter. This study adopted a weighted network model proposed by Mukerjee et al. and implemented the Filter Disparity Method suggested by Majó-Vázquez et al. to identify the most significant overlaps in the network. The implementation result on news media outlets data in three countries, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, shows that network analysis of follower overlap data can offer relevant insights about media diet and the way readers navigate various news sources available on social media. © 2019 by the authors.","Media network; Network analysis; Network model; Online news media; Twitter","Electric network analysis; Indonesia; Network modeling; News media; News sources; Online news; Social media; Twitter; Weighted network models; Social networking (online)",,,,"Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, CREST

The model that will be evaluated is software complexity prediction model based on requirement. This model allows measuring software complexity before actual design and implementation. The experiment used three datasets namely training dataset, validation data set, and test dataset. For performance evaluation using Mean squared error. Mean squared error is very good at giving a description of how consistent the model is built. By minimizing the value of mean squared error, it means minimizing model variants. Models that have small variants are able to give relatively more consistent results for all input data compared to models with large variants. This research proposes the application of the Bayesian regularization algorithm for evaluating the performance of software complexity prediction model based on requirement. With this research it is expected to know how much the performance of the model that has been built. © BEIESP.","Algorithm; Complexity; Prediction; Software",,,,,,,,"Liu, X., (1999) Object-Oriented Software Metrics; Na, K., Simpson, J.T., Li, X., Singh, T., Kim, K., (2007) Software Development Risk and Project Performance Measurement: Evidence in Korea, 80, pp. 596-605; Boehm, B., Abts, C., Brown, A., (2000) Cost Estimation with COCOMO II; Keshavarz, G., Modiri, N., Pedram, M., Metric for Early Measurement of Software Complexity (2011) Interfaces (Providence); Arthi, B., Selvarani, A.G., Sathya, A., (2016) Software Complexity Measure from Software Requirements Document and Cost Driver Factors, 24, pp. 6-12; Jakhar, A., Rajnish, K., Measurement Of Complexity And Comprehension Of A Program Through A Cognitive Approach (2015) Int.

The project manager or project owner really needs a good calculation so that the use of resources can be done more efficiently. Use Case Points (UCP) is one method that can be used to measure the size of a software based on a use case diagram. Use case diagrams are usually made before the application begins to be developed into the application. In the calculation of UCP, there are 2 additional factors carried out: Technical Complexity Factor (TCF) and Environmental Factor (EF). This paper presents measurement software using use case points on the SIB mobile application. This application has never been measured both in terms of cost and size of the project. The results of the use case points method produce a UCP value of 129.86 and Effort Estimation (Effort) value of 1298.6 hours. With these results, the project manager gets a picture of the project so that the efficiency of the resources can be carried out properly. © 2019 ISSN.","Mobile application; Software cost; Software metric; Software size; Use case points",,,,,,,,"(2018) Number of Apps Available in Leading App Stores as of 3rd Quarter 2018, , https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores; Kashyap, D., Shukla, D., Misra, A.

The EA supports achieving organizational goals because of its functions. This paper discusses the results of literature review for the EA function. There are at least three reasons for using EA in organizations: its complexity, external force to change, and the alignment of business with Information Technology (IT). Furthermore, this paper also discusses how the EA functions can offer benefit for the Village Law. The Village Law is a legal product in Indonesia that is used as a legal umbrella to build Indonesia.

Ovarium cancer consists of benign and malignant type. Based on the data set obtained, this research try to classify the data set with support vector machine algorithm. The principle of SVM is how to identify a hyperplanes with maximal margin. Hyperplanes is a border line between the data. Here, we will used two kernel function in SVM, linear and polynomial kernel function. Next We will compare both of them algorithm to reach the hyperplanes with maximal margin. The hyperplanes then used to predict the class of data testing given. Finally, comparation result will be obtained from confussion matrix and accuration calculation for each kernel function while used to classify the ovarium cancer data set. Accuration result with Linear kernel function is 68.98% for first schema and 66.67% for second schema. Then accuration result with Polynomial Kernel Function is 83.79% for both of schema. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Diseases; Geometry; Polynomials; Support vector machines; Cancer classification; Cancer disease; Data testing; Kernel function; Linear kernel functions; Maximal margin; Polynomial kernels; Support vector machine algorithm; Classification (of information)",,,,,,,"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarium-cancer, access at january 2017; Usman, K., Kaship, R., Brain Tumor Classification from Multi Modality MRI UsingWavelets and Machine Learning (2017) Pattern Analytics Application, 20 (3), p. 871; Samosir, R.S., Filtering and Wavelet Transform Algorithm for Old Document Image Restoration (2017) Computer, Mathematics and Engineering Application, 8 (3), pp. 177-181; Megha, P.A., Ram Mohana Reddy, G., An intelligent Content-Based Image Retrieval system for Clinical Decision Support in Brain Tumor Diagnosis (2013) International Journal Multimed Information Retrieval, 2 (3), pp. 175-188; Taranjit, K., Barjinder, S.S., Savita, G., A Novel Feature Selection Method for Brain Tumor MR Image Classification Based onThe Fisher Criterion and Parameter-Free Bat Optimization (2018) Neural Computing & Application, 29 (8), pp. 193-206; Chaddad, A., Automated Feature Extraction in Brain Tumor by Magnetic Resonance Image Using Gaussian Mixture Models (2015) J.

Digital disruption has changed the way peoples do business and perform transactions. However, the bankers still found many problems when performing DB transformation. Main issues on DB transformation are that many banks still assume that digital transformation is about workflows and systems rather than focus on customer experience. Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data Analytics (BDA) have risen and played as an important role in the new banking era. The recent trend of AI and BDA enable banking to be more customer-centric based on data driven. Personalization service becoming an important strategy for leveraging the existing customer engagement, and attracting potential customer become new customers. This study explores the application of AI and BDA in banking for leveraging customer experience. This study used literature review and interviews to gather the data. We interview more than some persons in Indonesia banking industry to get the insight on the implementation of AI and BDA in Indonesia.

It is also what programmers spend much time on. Therefore, many tools to ease the user interface development are available. Many of them are part of integrated development environment (IDE) of programming languages. Some of them are more generic and available for a few user interface toolkits or programming languages. However, these tools usually assume their users are targeting specific platform: desktop, web, or mobile application. While generic tools are sometimes generous enough, they usually cannot make it totally independent of underlying toolkit or programming languages. Modeling tools exist, but it means learning something new. This is one of the backgrounds for what we propose in this paper. An application user interface model based on spreadsheet: software packages that have been around for almost four decades. We emphasize multiplatform output: design once and output in several platforms (we provide two: desktop and web; adaptable to more). We do not assume a specific toolkit or programming language, but we still care about styles. Our experiments prove this method is usable and results in quicker user interface prototyping—even for professional programmers—with development time comparison ranging from 26.7% (best) to 80%. © BEIESP.","Code generation; Programming language; Spreadsheet; User interface; User interface modeling",,,,,,"Dr. Ford Lumban Gaol is currently Associate Professor Informatics Engineering and Information System, Bina Nusantara University.

For that purpose, both qualitative and quantitative methods were applied in the study. Accordingly, quantitative data were gathered from an empirical survey as well as qualitative data gathered from focus group discussions. The results provide a descriptive data in the implementation of cloud computing and big data management as well as innovation capability and performance in the digital creative industry. Statistical analysis shows that cloud computing, big data management, and innovation capability simultaneously affect the company's performance significantly. However, there was no significant effect, either simultaneously or partially, of cloud computing and big data management on innovation capability. This study provide a benchmark of how the management of information technology can influence the implementation direction of cloud computing and big data management in the digital creative industries’ innovation capability. The findings also provide a new knowledge in a literature on performance improvement in the digital creative industries. © BEIESP.","Big data; Cloud computing; Digital creative industries; Innovation",,,,,,,,"Manyika, J., Chui, M., Brown, B., Bughin, J., Dobbs, R., Roxburgh, R., Byers, A.H., (2016) Big Data: The Next Frontier for Innovation, Competition, and Productivity, , http://www.mckinsey.com/, Retrieved on 22nd August 2016, from; Paletta, F.C., Dias, N.V., Information technology and communication and best practices in it lifecycle management (2008) Journal of Technology Management Innovation, 3 (4), pp. 80-94; Bughin, J., Chui, M., Manyika, J., (2016) Clouds, Big Data, and Smart Assets: Ten Tech-Enabled Business Trends to Watch, , http://www.mckinsey.com/, Retrieved on 22nd August 2016, from; Parkman, I.D., Holloway, S.S., Sebastiao, H., Creative industries: Aligning entrepreneurial orientation and innovation capacity (2012) Journal of Research Marketing Entrepreneurhsip, 14 (1), pp. 95-114; (2016) Profile MIKTI, , http://www.mikti.id/, Retrieved on 22 August 2016 from; (2009) Pengembangan Ekonomi Kreatif Indonesia 2025., , Desain Grafis Indonesia; Pangestu, M.E., (2008) Pengembangan Industri Kreatif Menuju Visi Ekonomi Kreatif Indonesia, 2025. , Jakarta: Departemen Perdagangan Republik Indonesia; (2016) Final Version of NIST Cloud Computing Definition Published, , http://www.nist.gov/, Retrieved on 22nd August 2016 from; Rajan, R.P., Shanmugpriyaa, S., Evolution of Cloud as Cloud Computing Infrastructure Services (2012) IOSR Journal of Computer Engineering (IOSRJCE), 1 (1), pp. 38-45; Rimal, B.P., Choi, E., Lumb, I., A taxonomy, survey, and issues of cloud computing ecosystems (2010) Cloud Computing, pp. 21-46. , Antonopoulos, N. and Gillam, L.

One of the communication ways between the government and citizen are the annual tax reporting services. e-Filing are the personal tax report application in Indonesia that provided by the Directorate General of Taxes under the Ministry of Finance, Republic of Indonesia. This system plays an important role in the government's efforts to reduce the queue in the reporting tax. This research aimed to find the correlations between trust and the usage of e-Filing application. Collected data are 61 respondents where 39 respondents experienced in using the e-Filing will be analyzed using the method of Partial Least Square – Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM).

All ideas from the development of intelligent transportation to a town that wants to build and want to change into a smart city, especially in the field of ACP (system created, computing developed), based on parallel management and control system (PTMS). PTMS is considered to be enlarged to a new generation of an intelligent transportation system, and its essential component of architecture then make the hardware and software that will support a new architecture in a developing city to a smart city. The case in a lift is a communication system on a car that uses peer to peer networks and smart cards, with a communication system in a vehicle is expected to control congestion in a developing city through an original town with a connected system. This paper proposed four aspects of surveillance such as Traffic surveillance, vehicle Surveillance, passenger surveillance and driver surveillance. The combination of these surveillances will create best applied Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) or can be called as Smart Transportation Systems(STS). © 2018 IEEE.","Intelligent Transportation Systems;

Safety, health, happiness and independence will be difficult for them to get even the elderly will be further away from the surrounding environment. Based on population projection 2017 data there are 23.66 million elderly people in Indonesia and predicted in 2020 there are 27.08 million people elderly. Smart homes that are currently widely studied have not focused on elderly; most smart homes only provide a sense of security and convenience for adult residents. And this will be a problem that until now has not solved the improvement of human life through technology to get happiness, care and health especially for the elderly. In many cases of the elderly, it is easier to send them to live in a nursing home and that keeps them separated from their families for the rest of their lives. That's what makes them less happiness. Orange Technology is a collection of technological elements to improve human life by getting happiness, Care and health. This study reviewed the journals of scientific databases such as IEEE explore, ACM digital library and Proquest published from 2002 to 2017. From the search results obtained 54 papers that will answer the scientific questions of this research. The result of this research is a framework of smart house that has Sensor, Monitoring, Wireless, Scalability, Low cost, GPS and ease of installation and maintenance as components of smart house of orange technology for elderly. © 2018 IEEE.","Components of orange technology; Orange Technology; Smart house for elderly and disabled; smart technology","Automation; Costs; Digital libraries; Health; Houses; Intelligent buildings; Pattern recognition; Population statistics; Elderly people; Home environment; Nursing homes; Orange technologies; Scientific database; Sense of security; Smart technology; Surrounding environment; Citrus fruits",,,,,,,"Abascal, J., Bonail, B., Marco, A., Casas, R., Sevillano, J.L., AmbienNet: An intelligent environment to support people with disabilities and elderly people (2008) Proc. 10th Int.

But aligning business strategies with information system(IS) and information technology(IT) is not as easy as it seems, because there are several gaps of strategies between upper level and practical level. Often the focus in system development is only on the architecture of the future system, even though the study says that the engineering model of needs is the most important thing in the process of developing the company's system. PT. SBS is a distributor and supplier company. Along with the development of its business, business processes also become more complex. The information system that was originally felt to be sufficient is considered to be no longer optimal so that it often results in delays in delivery with a fairly large percentage. Therefore, an Enterprise Resources Planning(ERP) system will be developed but it must be ensured that the business processes used are oriented towards organizational goals. The purpose of this study is to introduce and explain the stages of the Organization Goal-Oriented Requirement Engineering (OGORE) method as a requirement engineering method in a company's business processes that focuses on organizational goals. The research method was done by collecting business process data and defining key performance indicators(KPIs) in a small discussion group with stakeholders in the company. The results of this method were Goal Tree Model (GTM) diagrams which was then used as a reference in describing new business processes and in preparing the requirements specification documents. The conclusion obtained that the stages of the OGORE method are able to eliminate needs according to the organization's goals. It is also recommended to use the OGORE method as one of the requirements management steps in the Enterprise Architecture method to create new method as an agenda for the future. © 2019 F. L.

Depending on the experiences and languages, developing a web application could be a simple or complex task. It is complex because the programmer should use more than one languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, language at the server side, and others). To reduce the number of languages, programmers may use domain-specific languages. The more specific the language, the simpler the development could be. However, some researches show that language specificity itself could be another challenge. Therefore, to make web application development simpler and at the same time make the domain-specific language useful, more research is needed. We propose the usage of spreadsheet – software packages that have been around for about four decades. We emphasize simple modeling technique, combined with column/row based syntax, saved as comma-separated values (CSV) file format, which can be interpreted as a fully functional web application. Experiments prove this method is usable and results in simpler web application development with significantly less development time (43%) and lines of code (30%) compared with standard web technologies.

The internal threat is predominantly the result of poor employee behavior towards organization’s information security policy. If users do not comply with information security policy, security solutions lose their efficacy. The information security policy serves as a tool to provide direction on how to manage and secure all organizational operations including critical assets, infrastructure, people, and process in organizations. A major challenge for organizations is encouraging employees to comply with information security policy. The objective of this paper is to develop a model for investigating the critical factors that influence employee compliance with information security policy based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Some researchers have extended TAM to include additional factors that influence behavior. In order to develop the model, we conducted a literature review and a discussion with the information security experts from the Government and Higher Education Institutions. The factors that affect employee compliance with organization’s information security policy have been identified. Through this study, we find that the TAM can be used to develop a model for investigating employee compliance with Information Security Policy by extended it with organizational and national cultures. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Employee security behavior; Information security policy; National culture; Organizational culture; Technology acceptance model","Personnel; Security of data; Security systems; Conceptual frameworks; Confidential information; Government institutions; Higher education institutions; Information security policies; National cultures; Organizational cultures; Technology acceptance model; National security",,,,,,,"Nugraha, Y., (2015) Ian Brown, , An adaptive wideband delphi method to study state cyber-defence requirements, IEEE, Ashwin Sasongko Sastrosubroto; (2014) Indonesia Government Computer Security Incident Response Team, , security incident report; (2014) Best Practices in Email, , Osterman Research, Inc, Web and Social Media Security; Li, H., Zhang, J., Sarathy, R., (2009) Understanding Compliance with Internet Use Policy from the Perspective of Rational Choice Theory, , Decision Support Systems, Elsevier; van Kessel, P., (2008) Moving beyond compliance—ernt and Young Global Information Security Survey; Al-Omari, A., El-Gayar, O., Deokar, A., Security policy compliance: User acceptance perspective.

This insurance market is often characterized by incomplete information on both market sides, which could result moral hazard behavior. The intermediaries’ system attempts to cope this situation and provide efficient information gather from the consumers. At the end, it resulted the insurance portfolio need suitable with their current risk profile. Additionally this system provides the policy contract design and claim settlement flow. The workforces operate the system also require special skills and expert in many different areas, mainly as insurance math and contract law. This requires a scalable provisioning and “de-provisioning” of human workforces, which we argue that the implementation of Human Cloud service could leverage to better position. According to US Census Bureau (2009) Millennials generations are having the highest percentage 25.47% worldwide. Recent research conduct by APJII in 2012 shows that the Millennials Generation occupied 58.4% Internet users in Indonesia. This figure believes would be more significant in recent future years resulted potential workforces. Understanding their perceived values would be important in order to maximize their potential as future workforces. Extended version of TAM is use for this study which enriches by the Perceived Millennials generation values, which we argue could lead to better understanding to this generation cohort.

New horizons emerged with the implementation of the BI concept using “Cloud Computing”. The leading IT companies compete to develop BI cloud-based services (cloud BI). This study aimed to determine the factors influencing manager decision to adopt cloud BI in Indonesia’s financial service sector, using the diffusion of innovation (DOI) model and technology organization environment (TOE) framework. The research also obtains prediction of the cloud BI marketing trend in Indonesia. The survey conducted with 30 participants at the senior management level in Indonesia’s financial services sector. The findings reveal, the adoption rate of cloud BI in Indonesia financial service sector still very low. Only 3.4% of firms have implemented cloud BI, while 10% not considering the cloud BI adoption. The results of this research can be used by vendors to develop cloud BI tools that fit into the customer’s need. It is also very useful for marketers to know the characteristics and demographics of cloud BI users. For regulators, this research illustrates how and what drives regulators to make policies that can encourage companies to use the latest technology. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cloud BI; Cloud business intelligence; DOI framework; TOE framework","Commerce; Database systems; Information analysis; Marketing; Surveys; Business intelligent; Cloud business; Diffusion of innovations; DOI framework; Financial services sector; Senior management; Technology-organization-environment frameworks; TOE framework; Finance",,,,,,,"Olszak, C.M., Toward better understanding and use of business intelligence in organizations (2016) Inf.

Internet of things can be used for environmental monitoring to make an early warning system for disaster. This technology is much needed to warn people about flood that usually happen in Jakarta. In this prototype water level sensor are used to measure whether the water level has reached a dangerous state and flow rate sensor is used to measure flow rate. In this paper the number of notification sent and the time it needed since water level has reached a dangerous state until a notification alert is received is measure to see if the notification can be receive before flood happens. The result shows that most of the notification received before flood happens.

Social media application offers benefits in the form of a channel of communication between the community and the government or the group that has public interest. Through this application, the public could channel complaints about public services. Perception becomes the important key for this condition because user action is determined by their perception toward the government e-services. The result of standard measurement for customer satisfaction on government organization is used to help find the weakness of the service and correct it. The interface is made to be more user-friendly to ensure the effective service. So, it is necessary to develop the system continuously. Perceived quality is one of the important determinants of the success of social media application, therefore needs identification of the user's perception and expectations and involving becomes the key to success besides the good quality that will increase the trust and satisfaction of users. Evaluation of social media applications is needed so that it can provide recommendations to the provincial government of DKI Jakarta related to what things can be done to improve community service. © 2018 IEEE.","government; smart city; social media","Customer satisfaction; Information management; Smart city; Community services; government; Government organizations; Government services; Potential impacts; Social media; Standard measurements; User's perceptions; Social networking (online)",,,,,,,"Melorose, J., Perroy, R., Cares, S., (2015) Statewide Agricultural Land Use, 1, p. 84322; Pusbindiklatren, B., (2015) Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional Republik Indonesia; Prabowo, M.A., (2016) Aplikasi Qlue Dukung Indonesia Bebas Sampah, , http://www.antaranews.com/berita/546222/aplikasi-qlue-dukungindonesia-bebas-sampah-2020; Madyatmadja, E.D., Prabowo, H., Meyliana, Participation to public e-service development : A systematic literature review (2016) Journal of Telecommunication, Electronic and Computer Engineering, Augustus, 2016; Lederer, A.L., Maupin, D.J., Sena, M.P., Zhuang, Y., The Technology Acceptance Model and the World Wide Web, pp. 269-282; Pearlson, K.E., Saunders, C.S., (2006) Managing and Using Information Systems : A Strategic Approach; Shroff, R.H., Deneen, C.C., Ng, E.M., Analysis of the technology acceptance model in examining students' behavioural intention to use e-portfolio system (2011) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, pp. 600-618; Lassnig, M., Markus, M., Usage of e-government services in european regions Second International Conference, EGOV 2003, 2003. , Prague, Czech Republic; Bagaeen, S.G., Redeveloping former military sites: Competitiveness, urban sustainability and public participation (2006) Cities, 23 (5), pp. 339-352; Bigné, E., Moliner, M.A., Sánchez, J., Perceived quality and satisfaction in multiservice organisations: The case of Spanish public services Journal of Services Marketing, 17 (4), pp. 420-442",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2018","3 September 2018 through 5 September 2018",,142373,,9781538658215,,,"English","Proc.

Moreover, the AOI-HEP data mining technique has been improved with confidence mining pattern into two terms, where firstly give confidence mining pattern for each AOI-HEP pattern either frequent or similar pattern. Secondly, give confidence for each dataset as confidence AOI-HEP pattern between frequent and similar patterns. Confidence for each AOI-HEP pattern will show how interested each of AOI-HEP pattern between frequent and similar pattern, whilst confidence per dataset will show how interested each dataset between frequent and similar pattern. In this paper the mining of AOI-HEP has been extended to mine AOI-HEP association rules using the current AOI-HEP frequent pattern, since association rule deal with frequent pattern.

Various government initiatives are implemented with the purpose to build services focused on the community needs and to provide better access to government services to its citizens. Government invests the resources, power, time, idea for the provision of e-government with the belief that it will improve the service quality to citizens. The goal of e-government initiatives is how the government improves services so that public trust and satisfaction are increasing. To make effective services, interface design was made to be more user-friendly. So it is necessary to develop a sustainable system by always doing interface design evaluation. Perceived quality is a determining factor for the success of important government services applications. Another thing to be done to increase the confidence and satisfaction of its citizens is e-government should be properly managed to avoid failure. © IAEME Publication.","E-government; Public service; Satisfaction;

This metrics used to identify measurable properties of the code and relation between them. Several measures can be calculated with this method are program vocabulary, program length, volume, difficulty and effort. In learning process, the final result obtained by students should be linear with the results obtained each time the students doing their exercises. This study aims to see the pattern similarity relationship between coding that students do on each exercise in term of difficulty, programming effort and programming time with the final value that they obtained. The experiment was done by giving the students three sets of exercise questions which were derived from the final problem, then each set of exercise code done by each students measured using halstead method and compare with the final grade obtained by each student. © 2018 IEEE.","halstead; pattern; programming; software metric","Codes (symbols); Mathematical programming; Complexity measures; halstead; Learning process; pattern; Pattern similarity; Programming time; Software metrices; Software metrics; Students",,,,,,,"Arpaia, P., Bernardi, M.L., Di Lucca, G., Inglese, V., Spiezia, G., An aspect-oriented programming-based approach to software development for fault detection in measurement systems (2010) Comput.

In recent years there have been several studies that have used games, especially computer-based ones to improve the executive function of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) especially in working memory improvements. There are still several obstacles in using computer-based games that have been circulating today in Indonesia. The aim of this research is to develop and create a prototype game that can be used to improve working memory of children with ADHD using Bahasa Indonesia. The prototype game application is a race game with matching colors and memory work tasks; developed using Construct2. Players will play as a driver, delivering certain fruits to specific homes with different colors. The game also included visuospatial tasks such as remembering the objects. For performance test, CPU utilization, average FPS and image memory usage has been tested in several browsers. In conclusion, the performance tests results show that the first type of the prototype game is good enough to be played in desktop or laptop. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Software prototyping; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; CPU utilization; Executive function; Game for children; Image memory; Performance tests; Work task; Working memory; Computer games",,,,,,,"https://newzoo.com/about, Newzoo [Internet].

As that software productivity growth, several problems has been appeared in software project management especially that correlated to complexity. One of complexity factors is requirement. A unit of requirement used as an option to the design phase of product development. The requirement is also a main option in verification process. So the the requirement complexity in this research is used as parameter to predict the software complexity. Because of the data pattern to connect between the requirement and the complexity is complex. So that this paper attempt to make a connectivity model between requirement complexity and prediction complexity of software using artificial neural network method with Levenberg Marquadt and Bayesian Regulation algorithm. So it can be seen comparison of experimental results by using the two algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.","artificial neural network; complexity; prediction; requirement; software","Computer software; Forecasting; Neural networks; Product design; Productivity; Project management; Software engineering; Artificial neural network methods; Bayesian regulation; complexity; requirement; Software complexity; Software productivity; Software project management; Verification process; Complex networks",,,,,,,"Liu, X., (1999) Object-oriented Software Metrics; Na, K., Simpson, J.T., Li, X., Singh, T., Kim, K., Software development risk and project performance measurement (2007) Evidence in Korea, 80, pp. 596-605; Boehm, B., Abts, C., Brown, A., (2000) Cost Estimation with COCOMO II, Ed: Upper Saddle ...; Keshavarz, G., Modiri, N., Pedram, M., Metric for early measurement of software complexity (2011) Interfaces; West, A., Nasa study on flight software complexity (2009) Final Report.

Every year, the number of mobile application is increased. It is important for mobile application project owners to calculate the required resources before building a mobile application. In software metric, Use Case Points method is able to count software size of mobile application based on their functionality. This method utilizes use case diagram as their computation factors in the estimation process. Moreover, two other complexity factors are also considered in this method, which are: Technical Complexity Factor and Environment Factor. In this paper, we present software size calculation of QuestDone Mobile Application using 7 steps use case points method. QuestDone has been implemented, but we do not know its software size (i.e. how big the software, how much it cost, how many people is needed). As the result from use case points method, the Use Case Points value of QuestDone is 126.88 with Effort Estimation equal to 889 hours. The software size estimation process of QuestDone Mobile Application detailed in this paper can give an insight to project owners to count software size of other similar projects. © 2017 IEEE.","mobile application; software metrics; software size; use case points","Artificial intelligence; Mobile computing; Environment factors; Estimation process; Mobile applications; Software metrics; Software size; Software size estimation; Technical complexity; Use case points; Application programs",,,,,,,"Costello, S., How Many Apps Are in the App Store?""

The first two offer more flexibilities but greatly differ in complexities. General-purpose language is probably overkill for a simple data entry application. In order to be useful, domain-specific language should be as close as possible to the problem domain and still open to research. This paper presents Perkedel, a domain-specific programming language designed for data entry. It is inspired by spreadsheet concept and offers user interface definitions that resemble a paper-based data entry form. Spreadsheet is one of the most popular programming systems that has been around us for almost four decades and we argue that easy user interface definition is important. This results in writing source code for a data entry application that looks nothing like ordinary source code. This speeds up the development time, too. One of our respondents spent only five minutes to a develop a simple data entry application, compared to the fastest development time of 32 minutes using a generalpurpose language, for similar application. That way, we hope that Perkedel may add a little perk to data entry developer's life using this data entry language. © 2017 IEEE.","data entry; domain-specific programming language; programming language; spreadsheet","Ada (programming language); Artificial intelligence; Computer programming languages; Data acquisition; Problem oriented languages; Spreadsheets; Development time; Domain specific languages; Domain specific programming languages; General purpose languages; General-purpose programming language; Problem domain; Programming system; Source codes; User interfaces",,,,,,,"Soewito, N.B., Gaol, F.L., Abbas, B.S., Multi-platform application user interface design (2017) The International Conference on Advanced Management and Information Technology Service; Van Deursen, A., Klint, P., Domain-specific language design reqires feature description (2002) Journal of Computing and Information Technology, 10 (1), pp. 1-7; Van Deursen, A., Klint, P., Visser, J., (2000) Domain-Specific Language: An Annotated Bibliography, Sigplan Notices, 35 (6), pp. 26-36; Ayalew, Y., Clermont, M., Mittermeir, R.T., Detecting Errors in Spreadsheets, , arXiv preprint arXiv: 0805.1740, 2008; Abraham, R., Burnett, M., Erwig, M., Spreadsheets programming (2008) Wiley Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Engineering; Power, D.J., A brif history of spreadsheets (2004) DSSResources.Com; Nardi, B.A., Miller, J.R., (1990) The Spreadsheets Interface: A Basic for End User Programming, , Hewlett-Packard Laboratories; Sebesta, R.W., (2012) Concepts of Programming Language, , 10 th ed, Pearson Education Inc; Spinellis, D., Notable design patterns for domain specific language (2001) Journal of Systems and Software, 56 (1), pp. 91-99; Mernik, M., Heering, J., Sloane, A.M., When and how to develop domain specific language (2005) ACM Comuting Surveys (CSUR), 37 (4), pp. 316-344",,,"IEEE Indonesia","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2017 IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Computational Intelligence, CyberneticsCOM 2017","20 November 2017 through 22 November 2017",,135216,,9781538607831,,,"English","IEEE Int.

News aggregator system requires a crawler to populate its content; however, different website may have a different page layout. This projects aims to create a back-end for Noox and open source and scalable web crawler that is capable to extract data from different page layout. The scope of this project includes the web crawler, CMS, API, scheduler for web crawler, and implementation of socket server. The development process utilizes PHP as the primary back-end language with Laravel as the web application framework. The PHP back-end hosts the CMS and the API. The API itself will implement Representational State Transfer (REST) as its architectural design. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is used as means of the API to communicate with the clients. The API also implements JSON Web Token (JWT) for client authentication purpose. Python programming language is used to develop the web crawler. The web crawler utilizes BeautifulSoup as the web extraction utility. The web crawler can be adapted to extract data from different page layout by utilizing user created configuration file. It can also be configured to export the extracted data into a JSON file or database system. The result of this project satisfies the requirement of the Noox project. © 2017 IEEE.","Application Programming Interface; CMS; HTML Extraction; Web Crawler; Web Scrapper","Application programming interfaces (API); Artificial intelligence; Computer systems programming; Curium; Extraction; High level languages; Open source software; Client authentication; Content management system; JavaScript object notations (JSON); Python programming language; Representational state transfer; Scalable web crawlers; Web application frameworks; Web Scrapper; Web crawler",,,,,,,"Nielsen, J., (2010) Mental Models, , https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models/, 18 October; Hart, W., Albarracin, D., Eagly, A.H., Brechan, I., Lindberg, M.J., Merrill, L., Feeling validated versus being correct: A meta-analysis of selective exposure to information (2009) Psychological Bulletin, 135 (4), pp. 555-588; Chowdhury, S., Landoni, M., News aggregator services: User expectations and experience (2006) Online Information Review, 30 (2), pp. 100-115; Boiko, B., Understanding content management (2001) Bulletin of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 28 (1), pp. 8-13; Koster, M., (1996) The web robots pages, , http://support.kharkiv.ukrtelecom.ua/lib/TheWebRobotPages.pdf, [Accessed 2 October 2017]; Heydon, A., Najork, M., Mercator: A scalable, extensible web crawler (1999) World Wide Web: Internet Web Inf Syst, 2 (4), pp. 219-229; Brin, S., Page, L., The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual web search engine (1998) Proceedings of the Seventh International World Wide Web Conference, pp. 107-117; Burner, M., Crawling towards eternity: Building an archive of the world wide web (1977) Web Techniques Magazine, 2, p. 5; GitHub Repository, 6 December 2016, , https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy, Scrapinghub Ltd.

However, testing process is a time-consuming activity that requires good planning and a lot of resources. Therefore, technique and methodology for predicting the testing effort is important process prior the testing process to significantly increase efficiency of time, effort and cost usage. Correspond to software metric usage for measuring software quality, software metric can be used to identify the faulty modules in software. Furthermore, implementing machine learning technique will allow computer to 'learn' and able to predict the fault prone modules. Research in this field has become a hot issue for more than ten years ago. However, considering the high importance of software quality with support of machine learning methods development, this research area is still being highlighted until this year. In this paper, a survey of various software metric used for predicting software fault by using machine learning algorithm is examined. According to our review, this is the first study of software fault prediction that focuses to PROMISE repository dataset usage. Some conducted experiments from PROMISE repository dataset are compared to contribute a consensus on what constitute effective software metrics and machine learning method in software fault prediction. © 2017 IEEE.","machine learning algorithm; software defect prediction; Software metric; software testing","Artificial intelligence; Computer software selection and evaluation; Forecasting; Learning systems; Life cycle; Software design; Software testing; Fault-prone modules; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Machine learning techniques; Software defect prediction; Software development life cycle; Software fault prediction; Software metrices; Learning algorithms",,,,,,,"Kumar, L., Krishna, S., Sureka, A., Ku, S., Effective fault prediction model developed using Least (2017) Square Support; Kumudha, P., Venkatesan, R., Cost-sensitive radial basis function neural network classifier for software (2016) Defect Prediction, 2016; Malhotra, R., Jain, A., Fault prediction using statistical and machine learning methods for improving software quality (2012) J.

But to improve, it is very difficult. A company often get a problem to achieve a standardization of Information Technology (IT) services. This paper aims to propose an effectiveness and efficiency design of ITSM through capability maturity model integration (CMMI) in an organization to manage IT division. ITSM is affected by the procedure, performance, and capability of IT division. They determine the success level of the Services Level Agreement (SLA) within the organization. Derived from literature studies and interviews from the organization management member and the IT user, the paper argue that the practice of information technology infrastructure library (ITIL) done by CMMI is recommended to improve the IT services to support an organization to meet SLA. © 2017 IEEE.","CMMI; IT Services; ITSM; SLA","Information management; Software engineering; Capability maturity model integration; CMMI; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Information technology infrastructure library (ITIL); Information technology services; IT services; ITSM; Services level agreements; Efficiency",,,,,,,"Kumbakara, N., Managed IT services: The role of IT standards (2008) Inf.

This application will map the poverty levels of the water from 8,576 villages, 573 subdistricts and 35 regencies in Central Java by using the technique of spatial data mining and the approach of the water poverty index (WPI). Seeing the magnitude of that application scope, then it needs to do the software complexity measurement to find out further the resources needed for the development of the system in the future. The measurement of the software complexity is held with the Function Point (FP) method that produces the estimation of the resource requirements such as project work effort, project duration and speed of delivery. The results of the research showed that the software water poverty mapping owns the complexity level with FP at 136.64, the project work effort at 1,273 hours, the project duration in 4.037 months and the speed of delivery at 33.85 FP per person month. © 2017 IEEE.","Function point analysis; Software complexity measurement.; Water poverty mapping","Computer software; Data mining; Decision making; Java programming language; Mapping; Complexity levels; Function point analysis; Mapping applications; Poverty mappings; Resource requirements; Software complexity; Spatial data mining; Water poverty indices; Application programs",,,,,,,"Saptono, P., (2013) Kualitas Air Baku di Jawa Tengah Merosot Suara Karya Newspaper, 18 January; (2006) Palgrave Macmillan.

A wide variety of calculation methods have been widely used to estimate the size of the software, one of which is by using Function Point Analysis (FPA). Volume calculation software based on a scale of complexity. Since the point of measurement is highly subjective, in order to maintain consistency and validity of the results, the method should be run by an experienced professional. This method is then applied by the authors to measure the complexity of academic information system STIKOM Dinamika Bangsa Jambi using structured modeling approach. Measurements were performed in this study consisted of depictions information system is built into the structure. Which is then analyzed by counting models Crude Function Points (CRP), the relative complexity of Adjustment Factor (RCAF), and then calculate the point function. From the results of calculations using the FPA to software quality measurement academic system STIKOM Dinamika Bangsa Jambi obtained value FP 166.32 is good. Function point value produced will be used by developers in determining the price and the cost of software systems to be built or developed. © 2017 IEEE.","Function point analysis; Software quality measurement; Structural model; System","Computer software; Computer software selection and evaluation; Information systems; Information use; Software design; Function point analysis; Measurement quality; Point of measurement; Relative complexity; Software Quality; Structural modeling; System; Volume calculation; Quality control",,,,,,,"Borade, J.G., (2013) International Journal of Advanced Research in Software Project Effort and Cost Estimation Techniques, 3 (8), pp. 730-739; Gaol, F.L., Soewito, B., Leslie, H., Spits, H., (2016) Object Oriented Metrics to measure the quality of software study case Request online System; Lee, M., Chang, T., (2013) Software Measurement and Software Metrics in Software Quality, 7 (4), pp. 15-34; Sadiq, M., Asim, M., Ahmed, J., Kumar, V., Khan, S., (2011) Prediction of Software Project Effort Estimation: A Case Study, 1 (1), pp. 37-43; Srinivasan, K.P., (2015) Unique Fundamentals of Software Measuremant And Software Metrics, 7 (4), pp. 29-43; Pratiwi, D., Pratiwi, D., (2013) Implementation of Function Point Analysis in Measuring the Volume Estimation of Software System in Object Oriented, , Implementation of Function Point Analysis in Measuring the Volume Estimation of Software System in Object Oriented and Structural Model of Academic System no.

In terms of purpose, game has two types, which is serious game and non-serious game. As learning media, serious games need to have ability to motivate its player in order to play the game until the end so the player can finish the game while understanding learning materials given in the game. Therefore, the quality of serious game should be measured, like any other software. When it comes to measure serious games, previous models can't do the job well since all of them have no way to measure the game's content, especially to measure the content that can improve player's motivation. This paper proposes a new game measurement metric to measure the game quality factors, especially to measure serious game contents that can motivate its players. The result of this paper is a metric table consisted of measureable factors and type of test to measure them. © 2017 IEEE.","Motivational factors; Quality factors; Quality measurement; Quality metric; Serious games","Computer games; Human computer interaction; Game contents; Learning materials; Learning media; Motivational factors; Quality factors; Quality measurements; Quality metrices; Video game; Serious games",,,,,,,"Trisnadoli, A., Hendradjaya, B., Sunindyo, W.D., A proposal of quality model for mobile games (2015) 5th Int.

The growing presence of social media allows the opportunity for the branding and marketing of the non-profit organization with limited resources but demand high impact. Museum industry in Indonesia needs to preserve and communicate their culture to the public with limited financial and human resources. Social media was proven to solve this problem. The data was collected from a sample of 63 respondents using a questionnaire. The data were analyzed using descriptive analysis. The results were most of the social media users are in the productive age who have the minimum an undergraduate education, and most of them live in Java. They are not visiting the museum frequently, and their visiting purposes are to learn or study about Indonesia culture triggered by their school, relaxing, personal desires, and visit by accident. They know information about the museum from the search engine, offline, and social media. Most of the museum in Indonesia give bad experience to their visitor, and only some offer a positive experience. The limited social media users in Indonesia, who already aware of museum presence in social media, utilize it to get information about the museum (profile, exhibition, collection, and news), socializing with other social media members, and showing their existence in society. They suggest that museum management should update their social media frequently. This study examines the characteristics of Facebook Fan Page Museum user (age group, gender, residence location, and education level) and their behavior in using Facebook Fan Page Museum. Since there is no research in this field in Indonesia, the findings can be used by museum managers for managing their social media in marketing and education for the community. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Edutainment Marketing; Indonesia Museum; Museum Social Media; Online Visitor Behavior; Online Visitor Expectation",,,,,,,,"Hassan, A.I., Crotti, R., El Hassan, G., Haddad, C., Jain, C., Le Quesne, K., Misrah, T., Segal, H., The Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2015 (2015) World Economic Forum; Isacsson, U., Facebook as an Edutainment Medium to Engage Students in Sustainability and Tourism (2011) J.

Garbage strewn can cause many things, one of her dues is bins are overflowing due to the full so it can not accommodate the waste dumped from other people. Thus, the author created a new method for waste disposal more systematic. In creating new method requires a technology to supports, then the author makes a prototype for waste volume monitoring. By using the internet of things prototype of waste volume monitoring may give notification to the sanitary agency that waste in the trash bin needs to be disposal. In this study, conducted the design and manufactured of prototype waste volume monitoring using LinkItONE board based by Arduino and an ultrasonic sensor for appliance senses. Once the prototype is completed, evaluation in order to determine whether the prototype will function properly.

Software reliability measurements are performed at every stage of software development process to evaluate whether the software reliability requirements has been fulfilled. In this paper proposed the new methods to measuring the software reliability based on categorize faults. We use J.D Musa-III failure datasets are divided into 5 modules to measure software reliability using our method. Base on J.D Musa-III datasets we got the value of reliability is 0.7416 or 74%. The software reliability can be measured using this method and the future work is to categorize the failure of the software based on the source of its failure. © 2017 IEEE.","fault; matrix; measured; software reliability","Computer software selection and evaluation; Faulting; Matrix algebra; Software design; Failure intensity; Free software; measured; Operating periods; Software development process; Software Quality; Software reliability measurements; Time-periods; Software reliability",,,,,,,"Nanda, S.S., Soewito, B., Modeling software effort estimation using hybrid pso-ANFIS (2016) 2016 International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications (ISITIA, pp. 219-224. , Lombok; Ryan, R., Gaol, F.L., Service oriented architecture governance implementation in a software development project as an enterprise solutions (2013) Journal of Computer Science, 9 (12), p. 1638; Börcsök, J., (2004) Electronic Safety Systems, Hardware Concepts, Models, and Calculation, , Heidelberg, Germany; Pai, Ganesh, J., (2013) A Survey of Software Reliability Models., , arXiv preprint 1304.4539; Iskandar, K., Gaol, F.L., Soewito, B., Hendric Spits Warnars, H.L., Software size measurement of knowledge management portal with use case point The International Conference on Computer, Control, Informatics, and Its Applications (IC3INA 2016, , 3-5 Oct 2016, Tangerang, Indonesia; Musa, J.D., More reliable software faster and cheaper (2004) Software Reliability Engineering ,United States of America; Schneidewind, N.F., Minimizing risk in applying metrics on multiple projects (1992) Proc.

Along with this development, the use of information technology, which is the basis of the information system, should be considered as a very useful tool to survive in the competition in the hospitality industry. Previous studies have widely discussed the role of information systems at the strategic level. Including the assertion of Nicholas Carr that is 'IT Doesn't Matter'. This assertion need to be tested by the extent to which the maturity of the use of information systems through its elements could affect the company's strategic performance measured from the five perspective of Kaplan's Business Balanced Scorecard in the hospitality sector in Indonesia. The study was conducted by distributing questionnaires to managers of 3 stars hotels in Jakarta. Data obtained was further analyzed using multiple regression analysis. This study verifies that the maturity of information systems in general have a significant relationship with organizational performance both financial and non-financial. The contribution shows from 30 % to 60 %, contrary to the Carr's assertion of no strategic contribution of IT on the companies. © 2016 IEEE.","Competitiveness; Hospitality Industry; IS/IT strategy","Information systems; Regression analysis; Surveys; Balanced scorecards; Competitiveness; Hospitality industry; Indonesia; Multiple regression analysis; Organizational performance; Role of Information Systems; Strategic level; Competition",,,,,,,"Statistik, B.P., JumlahAkomodasi, Rata-rata PekerjadanJumlahTamu per Hari MenurutProvinsi, 2009-2014 (Hotel Bintang), , http://www.bps.go.id/linkTabelStatis/view/id/1373, Retrieved February 2, 2015 from BadanPusatStatistik; DiPietro, R.B., Wang, Y.R., Key issues for ICT applications: Impacts and implications for hospitality operations (2010) Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism, 2 (1), pp. 49-67; Buhalis, D., Law, R., Progress in information technology and tourism management: 20 years on and 10 years after the Internet-The state of etourism research (2008) Tourism Management, 29 (4), pp. 609-623; Quan, J., Hu, Q., Wang, X., IT is not for everyone in China (2005) Communications of the ACM, 48 (4), pp. 69-72; Carr, N.G., IT doesn't matter (2003) Harvard Business Review, 81 (5), pp. 41-49; Tian, J., Wang, K., Chen, Y., Johansson, B., From IT deployment capabilities to competitive advantage: An exploratory study in China (2009) Information System Frontiers, 12, pp. 239-255; Majeed, S., Impact of competitive advantage on organizational performance (2011) European Journal of Business and Management, 3 (4), pp. 191-197; Croteau, A.-M., Bergeron, F., An information trilogy: Business strategy, technological deployment, and organizational performance (2001) Journal of Strategic Information System, 10, pp. 77-99; François, B., Louis, R., Suzanne, R., Ideal patterns of strategic alignment and business performance (2004) Information and Management, 41 (8), pp. 1003-1020; Tallon, P.P., Pinsonneault, A., Competing perspectives on the link between strategic information technology alignment and organizational agility: Insights from a mediation model (2011) MIS Quarterly, 35 (2), pp. 463-484; Tapia, R.S., Daneva, M., Eck, P.V., Validating adequacy and suitability of business-it alignment criteria in an inter-enterprise maturity model 202 (2007) Proceedings of the 11th IEEE International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference, EDOC.

However, formula definition is often considered correct after tested with only one or few inputs. This may be fine with simple formula, but for more complex ones, more testings should be performed, in order to prevent solution that riddled with errors. However, writing a formula test case in spreadsheet software is not a simple task, mainly because there is no standard way to do that. In this paper, a simple spreadsheet test case application is proposed. User can define a formula, with many input variants, along with expected results. After that, application will generate a spreadsheet document, with all the needed contents for testing, along with test result. That way, user may re-check the formula and make necessary modifications (then run the test, again). Using this method, a formula can be tested first, with many input as needed, before it put in real document. All of these will impact in more productive programmers, with less time spent for debugging. © 2016 IEEE.","end-user programming; end-user software engineering; formula; spreadsheet; spreadsheet test case; testing","Application programs; Computer programming; Software engineering; Spreadsheets; Testing; End user programming; End-user software engineering; formula; Spreadsheet software; Test case; Time spent; Software testing",,,,,,,"Abraham, R., Erwig, M., GoalDebug: A spreadsheet debugger for end users (2007) Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 251-260. , IEEE Computer Society, May; Abraham, R., Erwig, M., UCheck: A spreadsheet type checker for end users (2007) Journal of Visual Languages & Computing, 18 (1), pp. 71-95; Antoniu, T., Steckler, P.A., Krishnamurthi, S., Neuwirth, E., Felleisen, M., Validating the unit correctness of spreadsheet programs (2004) Software Engineering, 2004, ICSE 2004.

Education is now very depending with technology and always keeps evolving to support each other. Teaching methods are now drastically change because the present of rapid development of technology. The way of teaching is now shifting due to the available technology and the students, parents and the society no longer accept the conventional teaching method, which is one-way communication. Presenting any materials with the help of technology, increase the successful rate of delivery of the materials and also increase the student's understanding.

And, if needed, multiple applications may work with same SQLite database, optionally, using filesystem sharing services. However, file sharing option is not always available and reliable in certain conditions. In this paper, we propose a server for SQLite database. This server will be using HTTP as communication protocol. To enable multiuser application, this server will be multithreaded. However, access to the database file will be synchronized to help prevent database corruption. And, as data-interchange format, JSON will be used. We also run several tests to make sure that proposed server is usable. Test results show that the database file is not corrupted, while still maintain acceptable performance. © 2017 Global IT Research Institute - GiRI.","Concurrent programming; Database server; Embedded database; HTTP server; Multithreaded application","Computer programming; Distributed computer systems; HTTP; Hypertext systems; Acceptable performance; Concurrent programming; Data interchange format; Data-base servers; Embedded database; Multi-threaded application; Multi-user applications; Multiple applications; Database systems",,,,,,,"About SQLite, , https://sqlite.org/about.html, The SQLite Development Team; SQLite Frequently Asked Questions, , https://sqlite.org/faq.html, The SQLite Development Team; Owens, M., Embedding an SQL database with SQLite (2003) Linux Journal, (110), p. 2; Most Widely Deployed SQL Database Engine, , https://sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html, The SQLite Development Team; Fielding, R., (1999) Hypertext Transfer protocol-HTTP/1.1 (No. RFC 2616); Nurseitov, N., (2009) Comparison of JSON and XML Data Interchange Formats: A Case Study, pp. 157-162. , Caine; JSON Developer, , http://www.json.org; Fielding, R., Reschke, J., (2014) Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing; Implementation Limits for SQLite, , https://www.sqlite.org/limits.html, The SQLite Development Team; Burnim, J., Sen, K., Asserting and checking determinism for multithreaded programs (2009) Proceedings of the the 7th Joint Meeting of the European Software Engineering Conference and the ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering, pp. 3-12. , August, ACM; SQLite: Documentation, , http://www.sqlite.org/src/doc/trunk/ext/userauth/user-auth.txt, The SQLite Development Team; Noprianto, Simple Web SQLite Manager/Form/Report Application, , https://github.com/nopri/sqliteboy; PostgreSQL: Documentation: Devel: Frontend-Backend Protocol, , https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/protocol.html, The PostgreSQL Global Development Group; Noprianto, Soewito, B., Pangsit: Spreadsheet-like domain-specific programming language for data entry application development (2016) The Eleventh 2016 International Conference on Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems (KICSS)",,,"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI);et al.;Gangwon Convention and Visitors Bureau;IEEE Communication Society (IEEE ComSOc);Korean Institute of Communication Sciences (KICS);National Information Society Agency (NIA)","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","19th International Conference on Advanced Communications Technology, ICACT 2017","19 February 2017 through 22 February 2017",,127106,17389445,9788996865094,,,"English","Int.

However, the testing process is consuming activities that need to be automated to save a lot of resources. Towards automated testing, automating test cases generation as the first testing process is being highlighted. This research aims to generate test case automatically from UML diagram since model based testing that conducted on early phase of software development process show higher efficiency. UML diagrams used in this research are activity diagram, sequence diagram and SYTG as the combination graph. These three diagrams have been proved as the most compatible diagram to generate test case from previous research. Method proposed in this paper is Depth First Search algorithm that is modified to generate expected test cases. This paper proves that modified DFS algorithm applied to generate test case is provide accurate result, every node presented on the test case, include any condition (alt and opt). Comparison result from three different test cases generated shows that test cases from combined UML may not necessarily result in better test cases, due to the possibility of redundant test cases for some test cases. This paper also presenting an experiment result that proving sequence diagrams can produce better test cases.","depth first search algorithm; software testing; test cases; test cases generator; UML diagram","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Computer software; Computer software selection and evaluation; Learning algorithms; Model checking; Software design; Software engineering; Testing; Automated test case generation; Depth first search algorithms; Model based testing; Software development process; Test case; Test cases generation; UML activity diagrams; UML diagrams; Software testing",,,,,,,"Hanthi, V.K., MohanKumar, G., A Novel Approach for Automated Test Path Generation using TABU Search Algorithm (2012) International Journal of Computer Applications, 48 (13), pp. 28-34; Srivastaval, J., Dwivedi, T., (2015) Software Testing Strategy Approach on Source Code Applying, 6 (3), pp. 25-31; Alazzam, I., Alsmadi, I., Akour, M., (2014) Test Cases Selection Based on Source Code Features Extraction, 8 (1), pp. 203-214; Tripathy, A., Mitra, A., Test case generation using activity diagram and sequence diagram (2013) Proceedings of International Conference on Advances in Computing, pp. 121-129. , Springer; Faria, J.P., Paiva, A.C.R., Yang, Z., Test generation from UML sequence diagrams (2012) Proceedings - 2012 8th International Conference on the Quality of Information and Communications Technology, QUATIC, 2012, pp. 245-250; Swain, R.K., Panthi, V., Behera, P.K., (2013) Generation of Test Cases Using Activity Diagram; Panthi, V., (2012) Automatic Test Case Generation Using Sequence Diagram, 2 (4), pp. 22-29; Hettab, A., Chaoui, A., Aldahoud, A., (2013) Automatic Test Cases Generation from Uml Activity Diagrams Using Graph; Sumalatha, V.M., Object Oriented Test Case Generation Technique using Genetic Algorithms (2013) International Journal of Computer Applications, 61 (20); Asad, S., Shah, A., Shahzad, R.K., Shafique, S., Bukhari, A., Humayun, M., (2016) Automated Test Case Generation Using UML Class & Sequence Diagram, 15 (3), pp. 1-12; Khurana, N., Chillar, R.S., Test Case Generation and Optimization using UML Models and Genetic Algorithm (2015) Procedia Computer Science [Internet], 57, pp. 996-1004. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2015.07.502","Meiliana; Computer Science Department, Jl.

The data recorded by PMU is displayed to determine and monitor the condition of the system in real time. In the future by integrating these data with existing SCADA system, controlling and regulating the electric power system is expected to be more accurate. In this study the response time assessment of algorithm for analysing PMU data using Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) and Prony Analysis is conducted to determine which method has more advantage for using in real time PMU data. From the analysis, it can be concluded that HHT algorithm is more complex and slower than prony analysis algorithm. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Hilbert Huang Transform; Phasor Measurement; Prony Analysis; Response Time",,,,,,,,"Phadke, A.G., (1993) IEEE Comput.

Psychiatrists use client-centered therapy to recognize five symptoms of schizophrenia. They comprise: delusions, hallucinations, negative symptoms, grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior, and disorganized thinking and speech. Patients experiencing their acute psychotic episode must be quarantined to prevent their unsocial behavior. An early detection of the schizophrenia symptoms is necessary to avoid acute psychotic episodes. An expert system to aid in diagnosing early schizophrenia symptoms is presented in the paper. The system represents psychiatrist knowledge in the form of rules, facts and events and uses them to assess whether a patient suffers from schizophrenia. The knowledge-base is displayed in the form of questions to the patient. The expert system uses forward chaining while gathering the answers from patient. All answers are transformed into facts and processed using Boolean reasoning to generate the diagnosis. The diagnosis states whether the patient has schizophrenia, and if so, it indicates also the type of schizophrenia. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Boolean reasoning; Expert system; Schizophrenia; Symptoms","Database systems; Diagnosis; Expert systems; Knowledge based systems; Boolean reasoning; Knowledge base; Motor behavior; Schizophrenia; Symptoms; Diseases",,,,,,,"(2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5, , 5th edn.).

The third is mostly attendance system has not been connected with the payment system in human resouces software or in the finance department. The fourth, employees who work outside the office can not do attendance process.

However, there are some obstacles, which make the company hesitate to create its business continuity and disaster recovery planning. This research aims to help initiate the development of business continuity and disaster recovery plan in a medium-sized enterprise, called XYZ, as a case study. To obtain information needed on company’s current conditions, and readiness in preparing its business continuity and disaster recovery plan, we used a qualitative approach, which involving observation and interview. It was found that the degree of disaster recovery preparedness of XYZ’s company is at Tier level 0 (no off-site data) from the seven Tier level of disaster recovery. The strategy applicable for the company’s current stage is a cold site strategy with the implementation of creating backups of all critical data and making a system image of the client-server based system, which used to run the company's core business operations. © 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. -All rights reserved.","Business continuity; Disaster recovery; Information technology; Medium-sized enterprise; Risk assessment",,,,,,,,"(2012) Retrieved from Asian Disaster Reduction Center (ADRC), , http://www.adrc.asia/publications/bcp/survey_2012.pdf; (1982) UU Republik Indonesia No 3 Wajib Daftar Perusahaan Pasal 1 huruf b; (2008) UU Republik Indonesia No 20 Usaha Mikro, , Kecil, dan Menengah; Snedaker, S., (2013) Business continuity and disaster recovery planning for IT professionals, , Newnes; (2009) Business Continuity Management Guidelines Second Edition, , https://www.riskcover.wa.gov.au/forms/pdf/bcm_guidelines.pdf, Risk Cover.

Research on this paper implements SOA design principles in the development of Animal Video Encyclopedia and Plant Video Encyclopedia. By implementing SOA, this paper would like to see if SOA affects the number of Function Points in the development of a software solution. Function Point numbers which are the result of Function Point Analysis (FPA) calculation have been widely used in software industry to measure the size of an application based on functionalities from user’s perspective. This paper uses FPA method to count the Function Points between both Animal and Plant Video Encyclodias solution implementing SOA and Animal and Plant Video Encyclopedias solution that does not implement SOA. Function Points from both solutions are then compared and analyzed based on the implementation of SOA design principles. Results show that numbers of Function Points of the solution implementing SOA appear to be smaller than the number of Function Points of the solution which is not implementing SOA. © 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Design principles; Function point Analysis; Service-oriented architecture; Video encyclopedia; Windows communication foundation",,,,,,,,"Erl, T., SOA Principles of Service Design (2008) Prentice Hall; Wei, X., (2012) Communications Solutions for Heterogeneous Systems Based on SOA.

Speed is measured by training time and testing time consumed, while accuracy is measured using hamming loss. Based on the experiment, LP-DFS-FSkNN is faster and more accurate since its training time and hamming loss are less than LP-RF-FSkNN’s while the testing time of both models are the same. © 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Distinguishing feature selector; Fuzzy similarity-based k-nearest neighbor; Machine learning; Multi-label classification; ReliefF",,,,,,,,"Jinha, A.E., Article 50 million: An estimate of the number of scholarly articles in existence (2010) Learned Publishing, 23, pp. 258-263; Spolaor, N., Cherman, E.A., Monard, M.C., Lee, H.D., A Comparison of Multi-Label Feature Selection Methods using the Problem Transformation Approach (2013) Electronics Notes in Theoretical Computer Science, 292, pp. 135-151; Manning, C.D., Raghavan, P., Schutze, H., (2009) An Introduction to Information Retrieval, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Tsoumakas, G., Katakis, I., Multi-Label Classification: An Overview (2007) International Journal of Data Warehousing & Mining, 3, pp. 1-13; Jiang, J.-Y., Tsai, S.-C., Lee, S.-J., FSKNN: Multi-label text categorization based on fuzzy similarity and k nearest neighbors (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39 (3), pp. 2813-2821; Sumathi, R., Kirubakaran, E., Krishnamoorthy, R., Multi class multi label based Fuzzy associative classifier with genetic rule selection for coronary heart disease risk level prediction (2014) International Review on Computers and Software (IRECOS), 9 (3), pp. 533-540; Tsoumakas, G., Katakis, I., Vlahavas, I., Mining Multi-Label Data (2009) Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Handbook, pp. 1-19. , Springer; Trohidis, K., Tsoumakas, G., Kalliris, G., Vlahavas, I., Multilabel classification of music by emotion (2008) 9Th International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR 2008, pp. 325-330; Kononenko, I., Estimating attributes: Analysis and extensions of Relief (1994) Proceedings of the European Conference on Machine Learning on Machine Learning, , New York; Kumari, P., Nath, A., Chaube, R., Identification of human drug targets using machine-learning algorithms (2015) Computers in Biology and Medicine, 56, pp. 175-181; Uysal, A.K., Gunal, S., A novel probabilistic feature selection method for text classification (2012) Knowledge-Based Systems, 36, pp. 226-235; Uysal, A.K., Gunal, S., Text classification using genetic algorithm oriented latent semantic features (2014) Expert Systems with Applications; Ren, W., Hu, L., Zhao, K., Chu, J., Jia, B., Intrusion classifier based on multiple attribute selection algorithms (2013) Journal of Computers (Finland), 8 (10), pp. 2536-2543; Zhang, M.L., Zhou, Z.H., ML-kNN: A lazy learning approach to multi-label learning (2007) Pattern Recognition, 40, pp. 2038-2048; Saracoglu, R., Tutuncu, K., Allahverdi, N., A new approach on search for similar documents with multiple categories using fuzzy clustering (2008) Expert Systems with Applications, 2, pp. 2545-2554; Vanisri, D., A novel fuzzy clustering algorithm based on K-means algorithm (2014) International Review on Computers and Software (IRECOS), 9 (10), pp. 1731-1736; (2015) Dewey Decimal Classification Summaries, 9. , http://www.oclc.org/en-US/dewey/features/summaries.html, Inc, January, [Online].

The method used is by comparing samples of application development projects before Telkomsigma implemented CMMI and after implemented CMMI. In gathering projects information, author observed documentations related to sample projects, organization policies and procedures and discussions with related parties. The data that has been received, is analysed with CMMI practice to measure its maturity levels. The result of the measurement is comparison of CMMI practice goals achievement before and after Telkomsigma's CMMI implementation from measured samples projects. The conclusion that the author can get is, CMMI implementation can improve Telkomsigma's application development process. © 2014 SERSC.","Application development; CMMI; Practice; Process area",,,,,,,,"Ahern, D.M., Clouse, A., Richard, T., CMMI Distilled: A Practical Introduction to Integrated Process Improvement (2008) Addison Wesley Professional; Benefit of CMMI (2013), http://cmmiinstitute.com/results/benefits-of-cmmi/, Accessed on August 20; Chrissis, M.B., Mike, K., Sandy, S., CMMI for Development: Guideline for Process Integration and Product Improvement"", 3rd e (2011) SEI Series in Software Engineering; CMMI Institute Published Appraisal Results (PARS): PT Sigma Cipta Caraka (telkomsigma) for Development projects executed in Finance and Non Banking Solution BU, Banking Solution BU, Product and Technology BU, , https://sas.cmmiinstitute.com/pars/, Capability Maturity Model Integration Institute (Accessed on October 18, 2013); ""CMMI for Development"" (2010) Software Engineering Process Management Program, , Version 1.3; CMMI for Systems Engineering/Software Engineering/Integrated Product and Process Development/Supplier Sourcing (2002), (SEI 2002b), Version 1.1 Continuous Representation (CMU/SEI-2002-TR-011, ESCTR- 2002-011), Pittsburgh, PA: Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University; Constantinescu, R., Mihnea, I., Capability Maturity Model Integration (2007) Journal of Applied Quantitative Methods, pp. 31-37. , No. 1; Reena, D., Ujana, C., Integrating CMMI Maturity Level-3 In Traditional Software Development Process (2012) International Journal of Software Engineering &Applications (IJSEA), 3 (1), pp. 17-26; Kohlegger, M., Maier, R., Thalmann, S., Understanding Maturity Models Results of a Structured Content Analysis (2009) Proceeding of I-KNOW'09 and I-SEMANTIC '09, pp. 51-61; Honda, N., Shigeru, Y., Success Factors to Achieve Excellent Quality: CMMI Level 5 Organizations Research Report (2012) Software Quality Professiona ProQuest Computing, p. 21; O'Brien, J., Marakas, G., Introduction to Information Systems (2009) McGraw-Hill Companies, , 15th Edition; O'Toole, P., Sampling the SCAMPI Sampling Rules or Trying to Explain the Unexplainable.

The IT Balanced Scorecard framework consisting of its four perspectives: Corporate Contribution, User Orientation, Operational Excellence, and Future Orientation was employed to assess the system. The study was accomplished in the form of a questionnaire composed of five-point Likert scale statements. The questionnaire was addressed to the members of the faculties and staff of the university who used SIPERTI in their everyday work. The data obtained was statistically analysed including the tests of reliability and validity. A structured interview which followed the questionnaire allowed for the formulation of recommendations on SIPERTI performance improvement. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Higher education;

Findbugs is able to detects many bugs pattern, but some parts are not quite accurately detected. It is called false positives when there is no bugs but the system raised warning. It is called false negatives if there is a bugs but the system didn't raised warning. Here in this paper, with another method, will try to improve false negatives and also false positives. In this paper those 2 variabel will used as measurements. JDBC used as an area of testing because most of JDBC syntax will not seen error unless it executed. This method is needed to handle bugs pattern which is not able to be detected by standard compiler. In this paper will be shown about how bedhigasan will win the false negatives of findbugs and how bedhigasan will loose the false positives of findbugs.

The analysis will be based on existing best practice in implement JDBC. To analyze JDBC, bugs patterns are needed to be compared with existing best practice. Various methods are available to be used in constructing this kind of application, but in this paper, static analysis non-linear method is used in designing this application. Static analysis means the java program code will be read and analyzed without executing. Non-linear meansthe java program code will not read sequentially, but it will follow the flow of the program code itself.

In this research, the authors designed an OERI application to support the learning material. The application uses the technique of service-oriented architecture in the search for educational services in three repositories which are DBPedia, Ariadne and OpenLearn. The application itself will be installed as plugins in Moodle. The focus in this research is the support of the educational material in the three educational repositories used which concerns how the three educational repositories can produce a relevant educational material document with the desired query. The measurement uses precision to measure the accuracy of the query, and along with it we will also measure the number of documents retrieved, and the number of documents types retrieved. Then these results will be used to compare the three educational repositories.

Approach: This problem was modeled as the vertex covering problems in graphs. The graph modeling of this problem as the minimum vertex covering set problem. Results: The degree covering set of a graph for every vertex is covered by the set minimum cardinality. The minimu of a graph cardinality of a degree covering set of a graph G is the degree covering number γP(G). Conclusion: We show that Degree Covering Set (DCS) problem is NP-complete. In this study, we also give a linear algorithm to solve the DCS for trees.

Approach: In this study we used extensive literature review and research publication. We also compare with some best practices that applied in the business and industrial field for matching the fingerprints. Results: Surachai Panich used his method only for around one hundred data. However, we found that in the recent research most of the fingerprint problems are explore in million of data. I found some of the literature review are quiet old. Since the advancement of Fingerprint matching is increase very rapidly so the comparison with the recent publication is a must. The comparison has to be in the experimental using million of data as the input. We do not find such experimental result on this paper. Conclusion/Recommendations: The paper should explore more in biometrics feature extraction for matching process. The biometrics have analogy to the use of physiological or biological characteristics to measure the identity of an individual. These features are assuming unique to each individual and remain unaltered during a person's lifetime. These features make biometrics a promising solution to the society. © 2011 Science Publications.","Biometric system; Fingerprint identification; Fingerprint matching",,,,,,,,"Greenberg, S., Aladjem, M., Kogan, D., Fingerprint image enhancement using filtering techniques (2000) Real-Time Imag, 8, pp. 227-236. , DOI: 10.1006/rtim.2001.0283; Galbiati, L., (1990) Machine Vision and Digital Image Processing Fundamentals, p. 180. , Facsimile Edn., Prentice-Hall, Eaglewood Cliffs, New Jersey, ISBN: 10: 013542044X; Hong, L., Wan, Y., Jain, A., Fingerprint image enhancement: Algorithm and performance evaluation (1998) IEEE Trans.

The most important application of web mining is targeted advertising. Sequential mining is the process of applying data mining techniques to a sequential database for the purposes of discovering the correlation relationships that exist among an ordered list of events. An important application of sequential mining techniques is web usage mining, for mining web log accesses, where the sequences of web page accesses made by different web users over a period of time, through a server, are recorded. This paper proposes web log sequential pattern mining using Apriori-all algorithm. We called as Apriori-all Web Log Mining. The experiment will be conducted base on the idea of Apriori-all algorithm, which first stores the original web access sequence database for storing non-sequential data. The experimental result will be given with analysis on further refinement. © 2010 IEEE.","Tree-Projection web mining; Web mining","Apriori; Data mining techniques; Mining techniques; Sequence database; Sequential data; Sequential database; Sequential-pattern mining; Targeted advertising; Web access; Web content mining; Web log mining; Web Mining; Web page; Web structure mining; Web usage mining; Web users; Weblogs; Algorithms; Data mining; World Wide Web; Telecommunication",,,,,,,"Agrawal, R., Srikant, R., Fast algorithms for mining association rules in large databases (1994) Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Databases.

Approach: In the recent years, data and networks in biochemical pathways are abundant that allow to do process mining in order to obtain useful information. By using graph theory as a tool to model these interactions, it can be formally find the solution. Results: The core of the problem of mining patterns is a subgraph isomorphism which until now has been in the NPclass problems. Early identification showed that in the context biochemical pathways has unique node labeling that result simplifying pattern mining problem radically. Conclusion: Process will be more efficient because the end result that is needed is maximum pattern that could reduce redundant patterns. The algorithm that used is a modification of the maximum item set patterns that are empirically most efficiently at this time. © 2010 Science Publications.","Biochemical pathways; Graph theory; Maximum itemset pattern; NP problems; Subgraph isomorphism",,,,,,,,"Akutsu, T., Kuhara, S., Maruyama, O., Miyano, S., Identification of gene regulatory networks by strategic gene disruptions and gene over expressions (1998) Proceeding of the 9th Annual ACMSIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, pp. 695-702. , http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id, Jan. 25-27, Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, San Francisco, California, United States; Altschul, S.F., Madden, T.L., Scheffer, A.A., Zhang, J., Zhang, Z., Gapped BLAST and PSIBLAST: A new generation of protein database search programs (1997) Nucleic Acids Res., 25, pp. 3389-3402. , DOI: 10.1093/nar/25.17.3389; Cook, D.J., Holder, L.B., Graph-based data mining (2000) IEEE Intell.

The most important problem to be solved in mining large semi structured dataset is the scalability of the method. With the successful development of efficient and scalable algorithms for mining frequent itemsets and sequences, it is natural to extend the scope of study to a more general pattern mining problem: mining frequent semistructured patterns or graph patterns. In this paper, we extend the methodology of pattern-growth and develop a novel algorithm called CLS (Canonical Labeling System), which discovers frequent connected subgraphs efficiently using either depth-first search or breadth-first search strategy. A novel canonical labeling system and search order are devised to support efficient pattern growth. CLS has advantages of simplicity and efficiency over other methods since it combines pattern growing and pattern checking into one procedure. Based on CLS, we develop CLS Close to mine closed frequent graphs, which not only eliminates redundant patterns but also substantially increases the efficiency of mining, especially in the presence of large graph patterns. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Canonical label; Closed pattern; Cls code; Frequent pattern; Graph mining","Breadth-first search; Closed pattern; Cls code; Frequent pattern; Graph mining; Mining frequent itemsets; Scalable algorithms; Semi structured data; Algorithms; Data mining; Scalability; Software engineering",,,,,,,"Agrawal, R., Imielinski, T., Swami, A., Mining association rules between sets of tems in large databases (1993) Proc. 1993 ACM-SIGMOD Int.

Social network analysis has attracted much attention in recent years. Most of the existing methods on community mining assume that there is only one kind of relation in the network and moreover, the mining results are independent of the users' needs or preferences. However, in reality, there exist multiple, heterogeneous social networks, each representing a particular kind of relationship and each kind of relationship may play a distinct role in a particular task. Thus mining networks by assuming only one kind of relation may miss a lot of valuable hidden community information and may not be adaptable to the diverse information needs from different users. In this research, we systematically analyze the problem of mining hidden communities on heterogeneous social networks. Based on the observation that different relations have different importance with respect to a certain query, we propose a method for learning an optimal linear combination of these relations which can best meet the user's expectation. With the obtained relation, better performance can be achieved for community mining. © 2008 Science Publications.","Community mining; Hidden community information; Social network analysis",,,,,,,,"Adamic, L.A., Adar, E., Friends and neighbors on the web (2002), Technical Report, Xerox Parc; Agrawal, R., Rajagopalan, S., Srikant, R., Xu, Y., Mining newsgroups using networks arising from social behavior (2003) Proceedings of 12th International, , World Wide Web Conference; Bazaraa, M., Jarvis, J., Sherali, H., (2004) Linear Programming and Network Flows, , Wiley, 3rd Edn; Bjorck, A., (1996) Numerical Methods for Least Squares Problems, , SIAM; Cai, D., He, X., Wen, J.R., Ma, W.Y., Block-level, link analysis (2004) Proceedings of the ACM SIGIR; Chakrabarti, S., Integrating the document object model with hyperlinks for enhanced topic distillation and information extraction (2001) Proceedings of the 10th International, , World Wide Web Conference; Chakrabarti, S., van den Berg, M., Dom, B., Focused crawling: A new approach to topic-specific web resource discovery (1999) Proceedings of The 8th International, , World Wide Web Conference; Chen, C., Carr, L., Trailblazing the literature of hypertext: Author co-citation analysis (1999) Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Hypertext and hypermedia; Cohn, D., Chang, H., Learning to probabilistically identify authoritative documents (2000) Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Machine Learning; Cook, D.J., Holder, L.B., Graph-based data mining (2000) IEEE Intel.

This method addresses the company's need to recruit employees with more objective and accurate by utilizing historical data to find patterns of potential employees for the company. First, classification will be carried out using data mining to determine the predictor attributes of potential employees. These predictor attributes will then be used to arrange fuzzy rule base and fuzzy logic structure which will be used to prioritize employees to be accepted. The results obtained will prioritize employees who are recruited objectively scientifically. © 2020 Clarissa Elfira Amos Pah and Ditdit Nugeraha Utama.

The created model addresses the company’s need in recruiting employees objectively by utilizing historical data to find patterns of potential employees for the company. There are four data mining classification algorithms compared in this case, namely C4.5 Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. The algorithm with the highest accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity values are operated to produce rules for the DSM. The results are C4.5 Decision Tree has the highest accuracy of 88.24%, specificity of 88.10% and sensitivity of 100%;thus this algorithm is selected to process the value of eight predictor parameter to propose the most valuable employee candidate. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Each year, e-commerce business increasingly popular. Some retail companies finally decided to focus on internet-based sales to get more customers. Along with transactions that continue to be carried out from year to year, transaction data continues to be stored and stacked and of course space consuming. So after years, Business Intelligence is finally appeared and offer great data processing. Without a business intelligence, these stacked big data are useless and wait to be removed because of poor knowledge. Business intelligence turns on the poor knowledge data into rich knowledge data visualization. This paper proposed a data warehouse that can be used to build a business intelligent with utilize information obtained from the history of transactions. To build up this business intelligent, authors uses methodology steps by Kimball which consists 4 steps of dimensional design process. Furthermore, data analysis will be presented in a dashboard using Power BI. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data handling; Data warehouses; Electronic commerce; Information analysis; Risk management; Sales; Surveys; Systems engineering; Business intelligent; Dimensional design; E retails; E-commerce business; Internet based; Transaction data; US dollar; Data visualization",,,,,,"Abdullah, L., Ramli, R., Bakodah, H., Othman, M., (2019) Journal of King Saud University Computer and Information Sciences; Diwandari, S., Permanasari, A.E., Hidayah, I., (2018) Journal of ICT Research and Applications, 12, pp. 54-69; Gang, T., Kai, C., Bei, S., (2008) IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics; Kocakoçy, I.D., Erdemz, S., (2010) Journal of Information & Knowledge Management, 9, pp. 171-181; Zeng, L., Xu, L., Shi, Z., Maoguang, W., Wu, W., (2006) IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics; Ferreira, T., Pedrosa, I., Bernardino, J., (2017) Adv.

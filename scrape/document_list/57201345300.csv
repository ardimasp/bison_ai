Customers need to spend much time to analyse the right property to buy depends on their constraints whether salary, distance to work, facility, etc. According to the problem, this research will collect the information from customer on property exhibition to find out the constraint. Also, this research will focus on design and analyses the decision support system for property exhibition. Software development life cycle that will be used is scrum which is divided into several processes like backlog, sprints, scrum meetings, and demos. The result of this research is a web application that help customer to collect the information of the property according to their constraints. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Decision support system; Property exhibition; Scrum",,,,,,"Ningrong, L., Seung, K.M., A Decision Support System for market-driven product positioning and design (2015) Decision Support Systems, 69, pp. 82-91; George, S., Dimitrios, K., Athanasios, V., Marketing decision support using Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Modeling: application to tourist destination management (2014) International Confenrence on Strategic Innovative Marketing, 175, pp. 106-113; Sauter, V.L., Decision Support Systems for Business Intelligence (2011) New Jersey.

Information technology provide many social media which is causing the leaked of personal information where abductor can find out the information. Using social media, people can share location, life event, and anything related about their life event, these become the useful information for the abductor. To anticipate this, a lot of personal tracking device is developed, but the response is too late. Because, the family or relative of the victims will notice that abduction had happen after the victim is lost. According to the problem, this research will focus on develop the personal tracking device which trigger by the victims who own the phone based on android and web application. Whenever the abduction happens, the victim just need to click the button and the system will send a message to the relatives and family in their contact also trigger the notification to the local security. Software development life cycle that will be used is scrum which is divided into several processes like backlog, sprints, scrum meetings, and demos. The result of this research is android application for user and web application for managing application. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Android application; Decision support system; Tracking application; Web application",,,,,,"Kinage, R., Kumari, J., Zalke, P., Kulkarni, M., Mobile Tracking Application (2013) International Journal of Innovative Research in Science, Engineering and Technology, 2 (3), pp. 617-623; Shirin, S., Dipina, D.B., Surekha, M.V., Mobile Tracker (2016) International Journal on Cybernetics and Informatics, 5 (2), pp. 213-219; Abhijeet, T., Ahemad, T., Ravindra, S., Pranay, D., Sumit, H., Mobile Tracking Application for Locating Friends using LBS (2013) International Journal of Innovative Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 1 (2), pp. 303-308; Abha, D., Hardik, S., Krishna, S., Global Positioning System for Object Tracking (2015) International of Computer Application, 109 (8), pp. 40-45; Pressman, R.S., Maxim, B.R., (2010) Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach, , Eighth Edition.

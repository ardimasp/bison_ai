In order to create sustainable environment in public space, study about existing condition of RPTRA in Jakarta is needed. The study conducted through descriptive method. Result of the study showed that the existing conditions of RPTRA are still inadequate, so a re-design of this public space is needed. The RPTRA redesign project aims to provide a playroom in accordance with the needs of each age group, as well as provide space for non-formal education facilities for the surrounding community as one of the fulfillments of educational programs in the RPTRA. The concept of the design is a playground design that fits the needs of each age group of children and a flexible learning space. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","behavior architecture; child friendly open public space; community learning center","Age groups; Architectural approach; Community learning; Educational program; Flexible Learning; Non-formal education; Public space; Sustainable environment; Sustainable development",,,,,"United Nations Habitat.

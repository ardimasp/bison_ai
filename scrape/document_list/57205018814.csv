The use of FinTech as a means of payment becomes a new phenomenon, while the continuous development of the online transport system is becoming a complement for the ease of users. However, the developments that occur produce the impact of the inherent risk to the system and to the users of the service. Therefore, this study aims to see the correlation between inherent risk factors that users feel from various aspects, and do the inherent risk influence the usage of Financial Technology especially in Online Transportation System? The research was conducted using a quantitative statistical method by using SPSS correlation bivariate and a descriptive analysis. In this study found 26 correlations that associated with the use of Financial Technology services and the inherent technology risks have a negative influence on Financial Technology system. © 2018 IEEE.","fintech; inherent technolgy risk; jinancial technolgy; quantitative method; sharing economy","Information management; Online systems; Continuous development; Descriptive analysis; fintech; jinancial technolgy; Quantitative method; sharing economy; Technology service; Transportation system; Finance",,,,,"ACKNOWLEDGMENT Thanks to BINUS University grant no. 014/VR.RTT/III/2018 who support the funding for this research until the publication.","Geranio, M., Fintech in the exchange industry: Potential for disruption?

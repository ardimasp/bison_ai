Technology-based solution was also being developed to prevent medication errors. Handwritten prescriptions that were difficult to read were replaced by computer-based prescription orders. In addition, anomaly detection machine learning algorithm was also used to automatically detect prescription dosage errors. SVM was a machine learning method that can solve both linear and nonlinear problems with good performance classification accuracy rate. However, SVM performance depended on the parameter selection, such as kernel, C, and γ. Multiple Grid Search Particle Swarm Optimization (MGSPSO) was proposed to get optimal SVM parameter. The comparative experiment on medication error detection showed that the MGSPSO provided higher accuracy rate, compared to other methods applied to this problem. In this experiment, MGSPSO could increase Grid Search and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) accuracy rate about 3%. MGSPSO also could decrease Grid Search recognition time. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

In recent years, educational institutions have modified its learning processes by using networking technologies in conducting their group or project learning. This research is aimed to investigate the usage WhatsApp Messenger among higher education students for Project Learning. Several factors will be measured such as student's attitudes and competencies towards WhatsApp for project learning. This study was conducted in higher education institutions which applies project learning and students who used WhatsApp. This study adopted a quantitative approach. Researcher will employ survey for this study in which the researcher will gather accurate information and generalize definite research results. A questionnaire was designed to collect information to a sample of population. . © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Students; Surveys; Educational institutions; Higher education institutions; Higher education students; Learning process; Networking technology; Quantitative approach; Research results; Teaching-learning process; Engineering education",,,,,"Apeanti, W.O., Danso, E.D., Students' Use of Social Media in Higher Education in Ghana (2013) Journal of Current Engineering and Maths, 3; Besser, H., Donahue, S., Introduction and Overview: Perspectives on Distance Independent Education (1996) Journal of Information Science, 47 (11), pp. 801-804; Blanchard, M., Metcalf, A., Burns, J.M., (2007) Report for the Inspire Foundation and Orygen Youth; Browne, E., Chipunza, P.R.C., Using Devices to Leverage Students Access to Collaborative-generated Resources: A Case of WhatsApp Instant Messaging at a South African University (2003) Journal of Open Learning, 18 (3), pp. 245-260; Jones, B.F., Rasmussen, C.M., Moffitt, M.C., (1997) Real-life Problem Solving: A Collaborative Approach to Interdisciplinary Learning; Kerlinger, F.N., (1986) Foundations of Behavioral Research; Lee Chin, Y., Adoption of Whatsapp Instant Messaging among Students in Ipoh Higher Education Institutions (2016) Wawasan Open University Malaysia; Mugenda, O.M., Mugenda, A.G., (1999) Research Methods: Quantitative and Qualitative Approaches; Rozell, E.J., Gardner, W.L., Computer-related Success and Failure: A Longitudinal Field Study of the Factors Influencing Computer-related Performance (1999) Computers in Human Behavior, 15 (1), pp. 1-10; Samuel, R.J., Zaitun, A., (2007) Do Teachers Have Adequate ICT Resources and the; Thomas, J.W., Mergendoller, J.R., Michaelson, A., Timmis, S., Cook, J., (1999) Papers Track 2: Teaching and Learning Models, pp. 73-77",,"Vaidyanathan S.Mamat M.B.Lien C.-H.Ginta T.L.MujiartoSambas A.",,"Institute of Physics Publishing","2nd International Conference on Computer, Science, Engineering, and Technology, ICComSET 2019","15 October 2019 through 16 October 2019",,159200,17426588,,,,"English","J.

This research offers insights into a broad range of views from users of social media about the use of social in building national resilience. The strength of the report is that it provides in-depth understanding of social media users and enhances government the use of social media for building national resilience. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Terrorism; Facebook; In-buildings; In-depth understanding; Indonesia; Methodology approaches; Qualitative study; Social media; Terrorist attacks; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Antoci, A., Sabatini, F., Sodini, M., (2011) Bowling Alone but Tweeting Together: The Evolution of Human Interaction in the Social Networking Era, , (Rome, mimeo: Sapienza University of Rome); Buckley, M.E., Fawn, R., (2003) Global Responses to Terrorism: 9/11, Afghanistan, and beyond, , (London, Routledge); Dershowitz, A.M., (2002) Why Terrorism Works: Understanding the Threat, Responding to the Challenge, , (London: Yale University Press); Dufty, N., Using social media to build community disaster resilience (2012) The Australian Journal of Emergency Management, 27, pp. 40-45; Ellison, N.B., Steinfield, C., Lampe, C., The benefits of Facebook friends: Social capital and college students' use of online social network sites (2007) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 12 (4), pp. 1143-1168; Manyena, S.B., The concept of resilience revisited (2006) Disasters Journal, 30, pp. 433-450; Norris, F.H., Stevens, S.P., Pfefferbaum, B., Wyche, K.F., Pfefferbaum, R.L., Community Resilience as a Metaphor, Theory, Set of Capacities, and Strategy for Disaster Readiness (2008) American Journal of Community Psychology, 41 (1-2), pp. 127-150; Rizza, C., Pereira, G.A., Building a resilient community through social network: Ethical considerations about the 2011 Genoa floods (2014) Proceedings of the 11th International ISCRAM Conference - University Park, Pennsylvania, USA, May 2014, , ed S R Hiltz, M S Pfaff, L Plotnick and P C Shih",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Advance and Scientific Innovation, ICASI 2018","23 April 2018 through 24 April 2018",,148653,17426588,,,,"English","J.

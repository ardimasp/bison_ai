Various algorithms began to be developed with the aim of detecting fake images and one of them is detection trace demosaicing techniques. The demosaicing trace detection technique works by reading the changes that occur in the color values within the image area that have been forged. This research aim to create web-based application to detecting fake images by combining web technology and algorithm. In this research, the web application managed to produce an accuracy of 72 percent in detecting fake images. © 2018 IEEE.","application; demosaicing; false; image; web","Applications; Information management; Trace analysis; Websites; Demosaicing; false; image; Image manipulation; Trace detection; WEB application; Web technologies; Web-based applications; Web services",,,,,"Suleiman, A.H., (1981) Media Audio Visual Untuk Pengajaran, Penerangan, Dan Penyuluhan.

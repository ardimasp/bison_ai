They are expected to be having a character, skilful, expert and competent in their study. To accomplish that, the student attendance system are quite strict. Students will get fine for their late or absence at the end of the semester. The problem is the system is still manually managed. It is hard for the student to know their absence status, how much fine that they must pay in real time. The head of study program and head of study majors are also hard to track the problematic student which has a lot of absence attendance. To answer their problem, we proposed the solution using data warehouse development which was first proposed by Kimball for student absence attendance fine at University ABC. This data is analysed using OLAPto provide data visual such as dashboard or report. With this solution, University ABC can process and present the report of Student Absence and Attendance Fine relatively faster. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

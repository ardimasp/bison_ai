Because of this, the energy consumption has also increased drastically. Under such condition, it is necessary for efficient use of energy to introduce smart grid. At that time, electromagnetic interference (EMI) generated by the voltage harmonics from power converters which are connected to the power system becomes one of the biggest issues. Therefore, to suppress voltage harmonics in the power converters is required. Although it can be realized by connecting passive filters, it leads to circuit enlargement. On the other hand, recently there are some suggestions that the multilevel converters will be miniaturized and integrated in the future. If such a converter is introduced, it is considered that the smart grid system with renewable energy sources can provide high-quality electricity without EMI. Therefore, in this paper, the voltage harmonics to the grid system by assigning multi-level converters is investigated. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Electromagnetic pulse; Energy utilization; Harmonic analysis; Passive filters; Power converters; Renewable energy resources; Economic growths; Efficient use of energy; Multilevel converter; Numerical investigations; Power System; Renewable energy source; Smart grid systems; Voltage harmonics; Smart power grids",,,,,"Annual report of energy 2015 (2015) White Paper, Agency for Natural Resources and Energy in Japan 2015, , 2015-7 in Japanese; General purpose inverter: Current status of energy saving effect, performance improvement, and environmental harmonization (2000) IEEJ Technical Report, No. 807, , 2000-11 in Japanese; Power Conversion Circuits for Utility Power Line Interface (2007) IEEJ Technical Report, No. 1096, , 2007-7 in Japanese; Lai, J.S., Peng, F.Z., Multilevel converters-a new breed of power converters (1996) IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 32 (3), pp. 509-517. , 1996-5; Rodriguez, J., Lai, J., Peng, F.Z., Multilevel Inverters: A Survey of Topologies, Controls, and Applications (2002) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 49 (4), pp. 724-738. , 2002-8","Kamaga, M.; Bina Nusantara University, Indonesia; email: masamu.kamaga@binus.edu",,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","2018 International Joint Conference on Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering, CMSME 2018","24 February 2018 through 26 February 2018",,137994,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

In power converters with lower harmonic distortion and lower electromagnetic interference (EMI) which are required in many applications, bulky harmonic and EMI filters are usually connected. The volume of the harmonic filters can be reduced by increasing the switching frequency. However, higher switching frequency will cause larger switching loss and severe EMI. As another approach, there is possibility of intrinsic elimination of harmonics and EMI by introducing multilevel converters. However, as the number of levels increases, the number of circuit components will exceed the practical limit of the implementation. Thus, from a practical viewpoint, the main circuit and related circuits should be integrated. However, it has not been clarified which multilevel topology is suitable for circuit integration. In addition, the effectiveness in reducing total device loss considering chip size has not been evaluated. In this paper, the advantage of a flying capacitor multilevel topology for circuit integration is clarified by theoretical and experimental investigations. Also, the total device loss and chip size of the flying capacitor converter are estimated. © 2011 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

At the same time, the power converters with lower harmonics and lower electromagnetic interference are required in many applications. To satisfy these requirements, the volume of filters and heat sinks should be reduced. As a solution to realize higher output power density and lower harmonics, diode-clamped multilevel inverters are investigated. In this case, the voltage balancing circuit must be connected to the DC capacitors because the DC voltages tend to unbalance when the number of the output level exceeds three. Therefore, the total volume of the converters including the voltage balancing circuit should be investigated. In this paper, resonant switched capacitor converter is treated as a promising solution to realize the voltage balancing circuit with smaller volume.

Therefore, it is necessary to construct power network systems that consist of semiconductor power converters with various functions such as generation of the electric power, storing and discharge of the electric power. This paper describes high-speed coordination control methods for the multiple power converter systems. First, as a simplest example, a combined system of a PWM rectifier and a PWM inverter is investigated. Several coordination control methods are applied to minimize the required capacitance of the DC smoothing capacitor. The effectiveness of the coordination control methods are evaluated from the viewpoint of the over-voltage reduction and transient response of the DC link voltage. As a next step, to verify the effectiveness of the investigated coordination control methods in general multiple power converter systems, they are applied to a combined system that consists of 1 PWM rectifier and 2 PWM inverters. Furthermore, a general approach of the coordination control of multiple converter systems is discussed.","Coordination control; Energy network; Multiple power converter systems","Combined system; Converter system; Coordination control; DC-link voltages; Electric power; General approach; High-speed; Over-voltages; Power network systems; PWM inverter; PWM rectifier; Renewable energies; Semiconductor power converters; Transient response; Capacitance; Counting circuits; Electric discharges; Electric machinery; Electric power measurement; Power converters; Pulse modulation; Pulse width modulation; Renewable energy resources; Electric rectifiers",,,,,"Ohashi, H., Omura, I., Matsumoto, S., Sato, Y., Tadano, H., Ishii, I., Power Electronics Innovation with Next Generation Advanced Power Devices (2004) IEICE Trans. on Communication, 87 B (12), pp. 3422-3429; Ito, Y., Yang, Z.Q., Akagi, H., A Control Method of a Small-Scale DC Power System Including Distribution Generators (2006) IEEJ Transactions on Industry Applications, 126 (9), pp. 1236-1242. , In Japanese; Xu, J., Kamaga, M., Sato, Y., A Basic Investigation of High-Speed Coordination Control for Power converters (2008) JIASC2008, pp. 1-14. , In Japanese; Xu, J., Kamaga, M., Sato, Y., A Experiment Investigation of High-Speed Coordination Control for Power converters (2009) IEEJ2009, pp. 4-011. , In Japanese; Paigi, P., Lasseter, R.H., Autonomous control of microgrids Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2006, , IEEE; Kakigano, H., Miura, Y., Ise, T., Uchiba, R., DC Microgrid for Super High Quality distribution-system configuration and control of distributed generations and energy storage devices Proc.

To use device simulation which is based on considering of switching experimental results and static characteristics is employed to estimate device loss. In device simulation, also, we adjust an anode injection efficiency of Si-IGBT to increase switching speed and optimize trade-off relation between on-state voltage and switching loss of Si-IGBT due to minimize total device loss. As the device simulation result, the switching frequency of in combination optimized Si-IGBT and SiC-SBD has approximately three times as high as Si-IGBT with Si-PiN diode.

The 1.2kV and 3.3kV SiC-PiN diode, SiC-SBD, Si-PiN diode, Si-IGBT and Si-IEGT are used. The devices structures in device simulation are determined by comparing static and switching characteristics to those in the experiment. Moreover it is confirmed that the total devices switching loss in device simulation is appropriate by comparing it with experimental results. In device simulation, six combinations are evaluated under 1200 DC voltage and two temperature conditions. As the simulation results, we present optimum combination of silicon carbide diodes and silicon switching devices from the viewpoint of devices loss in the switching frequency of several kHz.",,"Computer simulation; Diodes; Switching; Devices structures; Switching devices; Silicon carbide",,,,,"Brunner, H., Bruckmann, M., Hierholzer, M., Laska, T., Porst, A., Improved 3.5kV IGBT-Diode Chipset and 800A Module Applications (1996) Proc IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conf.(PESC), pp. 1748-1753; Bernet, S., Teichmann, R., Zuckerberger, A., Steimer, P., Comparison of High Power IGBTs and Hard Driven GTOs for High Power Inverters (1998) Proc IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conf.

In text summarization, there are two ways that can be used: extractive approach and abstractive approach. In this research, the summarization was conducted using extractive approach. The extraction process was conducted by taking a few sentences from a document and combining them into a short summary. The most common method used in conducting text summarization is graph-based method. The authors proposed another method for summarization, namely term weighting method. The purpose of this study is to compare between the result of graph-based method and term weighting method in order to determine the best method for text summarization. The text pre-processing phase involves omitting the stopwords and the affixes. Moreover, the researcher utilized the measurement of Precision, Recall and F-Score. Based on the experiment using the proposed method (term weighting method), the result shows that the average values on Precision and F-score for term-weighting method are 0.296 and 0.280 respectively, which are better than the values of graph-based method. In the end, the result shows that the proposed method, which is the term weighting method, produced better summary compared to graph-based method. © 2019 The Authors.

Status created by social media users describes the characteristics of their personality. This research was conducted to find out the traits of social media users on Facebook by mining the users’ Facebook posts. The texts were categorized and classified using SVM, Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression in order to get the traits of each user. The data for this case study was taken from Indonesian users of Facebook. The result of this mining was compared to the results of the previous research. To handle the problem of imbalanced user data, synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was used.

Moreover, most of them have the same service or feature for serving their customers. To get back the feedback of their customers, many companies use social media (Facebook and Twitter) for marketing activity or communicating directly with their customers. The development of current technology allows the company to take data from social media. Thus, many companies take social media data for analyses. This study proposed developing a data warehouse to analyze data in social media such as likes, comments, and sentiment. Since the sentiment is not provided directly from social media data, this study uses lexicon based classification to categorize the sentiment of users' comments. This data warehouse provides business intelligence to see the performance of the company based on their social media data. The data warehouse is built using three travel companies in Indonesia. As a result, this data warehouse provides the comparison of the performance based on the social media data. © 2018 Halmstad University.","Business intelligence; Lexicon based classification; Sentiment analysis; Social media",,,,,,"Adriani, M., Asian, J., Nazief, B., Tahaghoghi, S.M., Williams, H.E., Stemming Indonesian: A confix-stripping approach (2007) Journal ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing (TALIP); Alalwan, A.A., Rana, N.P., Dwivedi, Y.K., Algharabatc, R., Social media in marketing: A review and analysis of the existing literature (2017) Telematics and Informatics, pp. 1177-1190; Atmadjati, A., (2012) Era Maskapai Saat Ini, , Yogyakarta: Leutika Prio; Barlow, J., Maul, D., (2000) Emotional Value: Creating Strong Bonds with Your Customers, , San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler Pub-lishers, Inc; Bo, P., Lee, L., Vaithyanathan, S., Thumbs up?

Many organizations has implemented a computer-based service at their business process. IT Infrastructure is used to support the computerized business process that means its need to be managed as services. Therefore, for giving more value for the IT Services, organization need to apply an IT Services Management (ITSM). In Indonesia, a lot of organization has implemented a framework that can manage the IT Infrastructure, namely IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL). This framework is a best practice for ITSM that mean ITIL is not a standard of ITSM but a best, good and common practice that was successfully implemented at a large number of the organization.

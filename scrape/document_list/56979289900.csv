Unlike the cat swam optimization that operates one cat, this algorithm uses some cats as population bases to converge the result. ACPSO employs an adaptive method by choosing a seeking mode or tracing mode based on a mixture ratio (MR). In the tracing mode, this algorithm uses a modified particle swarm optimization to increase diversity solutions. To demonstrate the performance, ACPSO was conducted to solve some datasets clustering problem. The results show that ACPSO has a good performance compared to the other methods. © 2016 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Cat swarm optimization; Clustering; CSO; Data clustering; PSO",,,,,,"Kumar, Y., Sahoo, G., An Improved Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm Based on Opposition-Based Learning and Cauchy Operator for Clustering (2015) Journal of Information Processing Systems; Zinjore, R.S., Kolhe, S.R., Data Clustering Using Supervised and Unsupervised Learning (2008) National Conference on “Computing Communication and Electronica”, , Organized by KCE’s College of Engineering and I.T.

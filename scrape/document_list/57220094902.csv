Mobile applications nowadays have created tremendously compared with the website. Usability issues will be questioning as a measurement of mobile application accepted in the market. This paper reports on the systematic literature review (SLR) from 2010 up to 2020 to investigate how usability evaluation of mobile applications will change along the time through the evaluation of mobile devices. From 168 paper retrieved, 32 papers are selected to find the relevance of the research question. The result shows several famous indicators of usability evaluation, which are effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction. There are new inclusions that come as new indicators such as error, learnability, memorability, simplicity, and cognitive load. This result indicates the need for future research especially for new rapid applications created © 2020 IEEE.","Application; Device; Evaluation; Mobile; Usability","Information management; Usability engineering; Cognitive loads; Growth technologies; Mobile applications; Research questions; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Usability evaluation; User satisfaction; Mobile computing",,,,,"Cole, J.S., Bergin, D.A., Whittaker, T.A., Predicting student achievement for low stakes tests with effort and task value (2008) Contemp.

Method data analysis using factor analysis. Method the results obtained from this study is the analysis of new factors and indicators that can be used as a basis for determining that the effect of a successful ERP implementation. Data obtained from questionnaires to 120 respondents in Ministry of Finance unit. Data can be processed from the 92 questionnaire respondents. Data were analyzed using reliability and factor analysis method after that proceed by using regression analysis. Results obtained in the form of a new model that can be used by the Finance Ministry is to evaluate the success of ERP Systems implementation. By using the new model of successful ERP System Implementation evaluate this, we can determine the minimum and maximum values that affect the successful of ERP system implementation to make a reference to improvement and development process of the system for the better system ahead. © 2018 IEEE.","enterprise resources planning; evaluation; factor analysis; regression analysis; successful system implementation","Data handling; Factor analysis; Finance; Information analysis; Information management; Multivariant analysis; Regression analysis; Reliability analysis; Surveys; Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems; Enterprise resources planning; Erp system implementations; ERP systems implementations; evaluation; Factor analysis method; Research methodologies; System implementation; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,"Chou, D.C., Tripuramallu, H.B., Chou, A.Y., BI and ERP integration (2005) Information Management & Computer Security, 13 (5), pp. 340-349; Jayawickrama, U., Yapa, S., Factors affecting ERP Implementations: Client and consultant perspectives.IBIMA Publishing (2013) Journal of Enterprise Resource Planning Studies, , http://www.ibimapublishing.com/journals/JERPS/jerps.html.2013, 2013), Article ID 227873 13; Tambovcevs, A., Tambovceva, T., (2013) ERP system implementation: Benefits and economic effectiveness.

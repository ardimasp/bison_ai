Studies have consistently indicated that students generally believed that the use of technology for oral presentation would facilitate their learning. Students in such condition believed that the class was more organized, clear and interesting. Students also liked the teacher/lecturer more and indicated that they would like to take another class from the teacher/lecturer when the he or she used technology means of presentation. This research was focusing on the perspective of students in Binus University regarding the advantages or disadvantages of this model of learning process in regard of interesting or boring and long or short endurance of understanding. The visual aid presentation here meant that the students were the ones who were performing the presentation, instead of the teacher/lecturer. The research method used was descriptive qualitative based on the survey and interview of some sample students who were chosen randomly, who were taking English course in first/second semester.Based on some researches, the visual aid presentation in learning process was showing positive impact for teachers and students. Therefore, the hypothesis on this research was that the visual aid presentation on learning process would bring an interesting environment, long endurance of understanding and improving students' behavior. It was expected that the result of this research could be used to improve the learning method of English learning in Binus University in order to support Binus Vision to be a global university and to enrich graduates with the skill of oral presentation.The respondents were selected from management students in Binus, Alam Sutera Campus, and randomly chosen. All of the respondents replied that learning by doing presentations was giving more understanding on topics, boosting up self-confident, teaching public speaking, handling nervous and creating a dynamic class environment to avoid boredom. From the students' point of view, this learning method was giving advantage for students and long endurance of understanding. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Learning systems; Technical presentations; Colleges and universities; English Learning; Learning by doing; Learning English; Learning methods; Oral presentations; research methods; Students' behaviors; Students",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement","This work is supported by the Research and Technology Transfer Office (RTTO), a part of Research Grant to Binus Faculty Member.","Alkash, K.A., Al-Dersi, Z.E., Advantages of Using PowerPoint Presentation in EFL Classroom & the (2013) Journal of English Language & Translation Studies, 1; (2015) Rencana Strategis Penelitian Binus University Tahun 2015-2019.; Willyarto, M.N., Chairiyani, R., Pane, M., Mathematics Learning Method of Bar Modeling for Grade 7 Students (2015) Advanced Science Letters, 21 (7), pp. 2328-2331; Benawa, A., Gea, A.A., Willyarto, M.N., Improving Teacher's Commitment by Improving External Factors (2017) Advanced Science Letters, 23 (2), pp. 925-928; Willyarto, M.N., Werhoru, D., Gea, A.A., (2017) International Symposium on Educational Technology.; Apperson, J.M., Laws, E.L., Scepansky, J.A., The impact of presentation graphics on students (2006) Computers and Education, 47 (1), pp. 116-126; Oommen, A., Teaching English as a Global Language in Smart Classrooms with PowerPoint Presentation (2012) English Language Teaching, 5 (12), pp. 54-61; Chou, P.N., Chang, C.C., Lu, P.F., Prezi versus PowerPointL the Effects of Varied Digital Presentation Tools on Students' Learning Performance (2015) Computers and Education, 91, pp. 73-82; Layne, A., Doing Qualitative Community Research: Lesson for Faculty, Students and Community (2014) Pshycology Research, 4; Fraenkel, J.R., Wallen, N.E., (2008) How to Design and Evaluate Research in Education, Seventh Edition.; Yunus, U., Symbols of Cross Cultural Communication in Kasepuhan Palace Indonesia (2017) International Journal of Philosophy of Culture and Axiology, 14 (1), pp. 171-176",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","4th International Conference on Computing and Applied Informatics 2019, ICCAI 2019","26 November 2019 through 27 November 2019",,161570,17426588,,,,"English","J.

This research objective is to describe to deviation forms done by six RBS students when they learnt Indonesian language. Qualitative research and purposive sampling technique are used. The results show that the diction and sentence deviations become major problem faced by the students. The deviations themselves occur because of language transfer from students' first language to target language. The results of this study have implications in the materials development of BIPA program to assist the foreign students in learning Indonesian language. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Physics; Foreign students; Indonesian languages; Materials development; Qualitative research; Research objectives; Sampling technique; Strategic locations; Target language; Students",,,,,,"Nababan, P.W.J., Language in Education: The Case of Indonesia (1991) International Review of Education, 37; Han, Z., Tarone, E., (2014) Interlanguage, 39. , (Amsterdam: John Benjamins); Setyawati, N., (2010) Analisis Kesalahan Berbahasa Indonesia: Teori Dan Praktis, , (Surakarta: Yuma Pustaka); Soenardji, (1989) Sendi-Sendi Linguistika Bagi Kepentingan Pembelajaran Bahasa, , (Jakarta: Gramedia); Creswell, J., (2015) Riset Pendidikan, , (Yogyakarta: Pustaka Pelajar Offset); Villanueva, L.C., (1990) The Role of the L1 in the Acquisition and Use of the L2: New Perspectives, , (Bells: Barcelona English language and literature studies)",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Advance and Scientific Innovation, ICASI 2018","23 April 2018 through 24 April 2018",,148653,17426588,,,,"English","J.

Therefore, the authors conducted research related to the use of English in teaching Mathematics, for grade 7 junior high school in a private national plus school. The purpose of this study is for the reader to open up further insights related to the topic above. This research was carried out with experimental design, by doing different treatment between classes in the same level. The subjects of the study consisted of 63 students spread into 3 classes, 7 Amos, Esther 7 and 7 Jonah. Class 7 Jonah is a control group, using Bahasa Indonesia (mother tongue) in learning Mathematics. Class 7 Amos and 7 Esther is the experimental group, where 7 Amos in English and 7 Esther used bilingual (English and Indonesian). Results of the study include the following: the use of English is not detrimental to the students in score acquisition, is evident from the class treated differently, giving an average final score of Mathematics that are not significantly different. The obstacles that arise in learning Mathematics needs to be reviewed from the process, readiness, independence, motivation of students and needs to be followed up critically so that students can achieve good results. Programs of short and long term needs to be created and observed in order to support the learning process of Mathematics for students, such as training teachers to be able to speak English, training teachers to teach Mathematics, especially for young children, to support action research by teachers, managed by the school. © 2017 IEEE.","English; Learning; Mathematics","Educational technology; Mathematical techniques; Personnel training; Students; Teaching; Action research; Different treatments; English; Experimental groups; Junior high schools; Learning; Learning Mathematics; Learning process; Education",,,,,,"Bernardo, A.B.I., Language and mathematical problem solving among billinguals (2002) The Journal of Psychology.

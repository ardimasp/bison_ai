Parallel schedule generation scheme is used to generate feasible scheduling solutions, while firefly algorithm is used to find optimal solution by updating priority value of each activity. A web-based application is developed to run the scheduling simulation. Scheduling simulation is conducted to determine the optimal parameter values for firefly algorithm and minimum project makespan. The optimal firefly algorithm parameter values are 10 for light absorption coefficient value, 10 for firefly population, 100 for maximal iteration, and 0.8 for random parameter. With 6 structure resources and 12 finishing resources available for construction project, the minimum project makespan value is [110, 142, 167, 224] with fuzzy magnitude value of 213.583. © 2018 The Authors.

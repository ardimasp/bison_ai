Hence the security risks from open platform and IP Networks contribute to the Risk of IMS technology usage. Appropriate safeguards need to developed in order IMS technology can be used safely and provide it services. The purpose of this study is to get a security risks profile in the implementation and operation of IMS on fixed telephone networks and develop the comprehensive security mitigation strategy. To obtain a complete risk profile, it required trusted and reliable risk assessment framework. The author chooses the framework of National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-30, which provides complete guidance in obtaining risk assessments. The result of the risk assessment becomes an input to develop mitigation strategies. Appropriate mitigation strategies derived from the risk profile and suitability of actions that need to be done. Security Mitigation plan are taken to reduce the risks that may occur. Mitigation can be achieved through comprehensive implementation of security controls in technical, managerial, and operational. With the implementation of comprehensive control of security risk reduction will be achieved. © 2019 IEEE.","IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) security; IP security; IT risk assessment; IT risk management; risk mitigation","Engineering education; Internet protocols; Risk assessment; Telephone sets; Comprehensive controls; Fixed telephone networks; Internet protocol multimedia subsystem; IP multimedia subsystems; Mitigation strategy; National institute of standards; Risk assessment framework; Telecommunication technologies; Network security",,,,,"Wang, D., Liu, C., Model-based vulnerability analysis of ims network (2009) Journal of Networks, 4 (4). , June; Belmekki, E., Bouaouda, N., Raouyane, B., Bellafikh, M., Ip multimedia subsystem : Security evaluation (2013) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Technology, 51 (1). , May 2013), EISSN: 1817-3195; Park, F.S., Patnaik, D., Amrutkar, C., Hunter, M.T., A security evaluation of ims deployments (2008) Proceedings of 2nd International Conference on Internet Multimedia Services Architecture and Applications (IMSAA-08), , Bangalore, India, December; (2007) Security Requirements for Ngn Release 1, , ITU-T Rec.

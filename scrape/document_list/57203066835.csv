The study was conducted from April to July 2015. The method used for this study is literature review. Data collection methods were interviews, observation of the features of the BPN web, check listing and documentation. WebQual method (www.webqual.UK) is used as a framework of this study. Measurement is based on quality function deployment (QFD) to evaluate the quality of a website based on research instruments that can be categorized into three variables, namely: usability, information quality and services interaction. Results show that the evaluation of the information systems of the BPN web to increase user's satisfaction has found some weaknesses. Weaknesses that exist allow for potential risks that could occur and recommendation is necessary as remedial action. © 2017 IEEE.","Evaluation; information quality and services interaction; Information Systems; usability","Information analysis; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Quality function deployment; Data collection method; Evaluation; Information quality; Quality function deployments (QFD); Research instruments; usability; User's satisfaction; Web information systems; Quality control",,,,,"Anderson, D.R., Sweeney, D.J., Williams, T.A., (2008) Statistics for Business and Economics, , (10th ed.)

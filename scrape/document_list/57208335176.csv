Data is obtained from questionnaires distributed to respondents from Bina Nusantara University students. The study period was from March to November 2016. Data was analysed using ANOVA. Results showed differences in terms of attributes, culture and value except personality. These results can be useful for new or current companies that already have or about to create new online shopping sites to enhance their brand image and differentiate their online shopping site. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Attributes; Brand image; Culture; Online shopping sites; Value",,,,,,"Aaker, D., (1996) Building Strong Brands, , New York: Free Press; Brown, C., (2012) 7 Ways to Boost Your Customer Focused Culture, , http://blog.marketculture.com/2012/10/02/7-ways-to-boost-your-customer-focused-culture/, October 2.

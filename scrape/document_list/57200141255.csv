Without exception, the development of chatbot for the hotel receptionist tasks also demands a massive training dataset. Unfortunately, laborious effort and hefty time are needed to manually collect a dataset with that size. Therefore, an information system is needed to assist the dataset collection. In regards to solve the problem, this research contributes in developing the information system that enables a massive data collection for training a hotel receptionist chatbot in a reasonable time. In detail, the contribution of this research are twofold: (1) developing a realiable crowdsourcing information system design to collect and store the dataset for training hotel receptionist chatbot; and (2) developing a user experience that can stimulate the crowdworkers to provide more data. © 2020 IEEE.","Chatbot; Crowdsourcing; Data collection; Hotel receptionist chatbot","Crowdsourcing; Deep learning; Hotels; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Metadata; User experience; Chatbot; Massive data; Peak performance; Training dataset; Data acquisition",,,,,"Adiwardana, D., (2020) Towards A Human-like Open-domain Chatbot; Zhou, L., Gao, J., Li, D., Shum, H.-Y., The design and implementation of xiaoice, an empathetic social chatbot (2020) Comput.

Palm Print recognizable proof is an imperative individual ID innovation and it has pulled in much consideration. The palm print contains standard bends and wrinkles as well as rich surface and miniscule focuses, so the palm print ID can accomplish a high exactness.

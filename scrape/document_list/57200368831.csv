Most likely due to the cyclic load from the traffic. The indicators which can be measured to determine the serviceability is the deflection of the girder. In this research, the PCI-Girder and vehicle load are analyzed by using the finite element method (Midas/Civil) Program. For comparison, the running vehicle test to the bridge has been conducted where the bridge deflections are measured using LVDT sensors on PCI-Girder Bridge. To find the effect of vehicle distance to the LVDV position, the running vehicle goes through on several lanes. The finite element program (Midas/Civil) gives relatively similar result to the measured deflection using LVDT sensors. However, when the vehicle load is situated far from the sensor, the result from both analysis showed significant differences. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Deflection; LVDT sensor; PCI-Girder; vehicle Load","Deflection (structures); Vehicles; Bridge deflection; Finite element programs; Function of time; Girder bridges; Load positions; Lvdt sensors; Vehicle load; Vehicle tests; Finite element method",,,,,"Akimovs, Paeglitis Edmunds, D., Ainars, (2013) Load Testing of Some New Bridges in Latvia, , (Latvia: Riga Technical University); Standar Pembebanan Untuk Jembatan (Standards of Loading for Bridge), , Directorate of Jendral Highways, Departemen Pekerjaan Umum (Public Work Department), RSNI T-02-2005; Issa, Dan Shahawy Moussa, A., Mohsen, A., (1993) Dynamic and Static Tests of Prestressed Concrete Girder Bridges in Florida, , (Tallahassee: Structural Research Center, MS 80 Florida Department of Transportation); Galati, Casadei Nestore, D., Paolo, (2005) In-Situ Load Testing of Bridge A6102 Lexington, , (Mo.

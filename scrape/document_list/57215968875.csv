This paper uses the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method in identifying, evaluating, and interpreting various methods of studies related to vessel anomalous behavior at the sea the author highlights several methods that are always applied to studies that already exist in detecting vessels anomalous behavior, the study detected the movement of vessel with AIS data from the history of vessel locations and fusion with another sensor in seeing movements of abnormal vessel behavior through patterns that were formed. This paper refers to various studies and reviews some of them about the use of AIS track data history in vessel including combining with other data to detect anomalous behavior of vessel, the results of the analysis are used to find out activities that have the potential for illegal activities or other crimes that can be detrimental and can be used as decision making, the authors hope the results of this paper can be an option to be applied to the surveillance system of vessel around the territorial waters in order to guard against crime and other illegal behavior. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

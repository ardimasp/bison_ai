The use of FinTech as a means of payment becomes a new phenomenon, while the continuous development of the online transport system is becoming a complement for the ease of users. However, the developments that occur produce the impact of the inherent risk to the system and to the users of the service. Therefore, this study aims to see the correlation between inherent risk factors that users feel from various aspects, and do the inherent risk influence the usage of Financial Technology especially in Online Transportation System? The research was conducted using a quantitative statistical method by using SPSS correlation bivariate and a descriptive analysis. In this study found 26 correlations that associated with the use of Financial Technology services and the inherent technology risks have a negative influence on Financial Technology system. © 2018 IEEE.","fintech; inherent technolgy risk; jinancial technolgy; quantitative method; sharing economy","Information management; Online systems; Continuous development; Descriptive analysis; fintech; jinancial technolgy; Quantitative method; sharing economy; Technology service; Transportation system; Finance",,,,,"ACKNOWLEDGMENT Thanks to BINUS University grant no. 014/VR.RTT/III/2018 who support the funding for this research until the publication.","Geranio, M., Fintech in the exchange industry: Potential for disruption?

Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is used as the foundation of conceptual model theory and research instrument developed. Models and instruments were then validated by a pilot study method involving 133 communities as respondents who had been declared valid. analysis of survey data obtained through Smart PLS version 3 applications. This analysis is used to ensure the reliability and validity of the instruments that have been developed. The results of this study indicate that the variable Attitude toward use with 3 instruments, Perceived Useful variable with 5 instruments, Perceived Ease of Use variables with 5 instruments, Intention to use variables with 6 instruments that stated reliability with values above 0.5 and validity with values above 0.7.The instrument has been eligible to collect data from the actual survey in this study. © 2018 IEEE.","adoption technoloogy; fintech; online transportation; TAM","Behavioral research; Information management; Reliability analysis; Surveys; adoption technoloogy; Conceptual model; fintech; Perceived ease of use; Reliability and validity; Research instruments; Scale validation; Technology acceptance model; Instrument testing",,,,,,"Baden-Fuller, C., Haefliger, S., Business models and technological innovation (2013) Long Range Plann, 46 (6), pp. 419-426; Stewart, D.W., Zhao, Q., Internet marketing, business models, and public policy (2000) J.

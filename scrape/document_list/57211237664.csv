However, many young adults suffer poor sleep due to work or academic demands. Even more, sleep is associated with stress which is many young adults experienced it. To solve this problem, many epidemiologic studies suggest that exercise may improve sleep quality. On the other hand, several studies show that daily activity has no association with sleep quality. In this study, we tried to find more evidence of whether the daily activity has an association with sleep quality or not. We used a commercially available wearable device to capture the subject's heart rate, step count and deep sleep duration for 7 months. Then we used linear regression, XGBoost, and Long Short-Term Memory to find an association between these variables. The results show that there was no association between these variables. © 2020 IEEE.","Heart rate; Physical activity; Sleep quality; Step count; Wearable device","Information management; Wearable technology; Daily activity; Epidemiologic-study; Heart rates; Mental health; Sleep quality; Wearable devices; Young adults; Sleep research",,,,,,"Watson, N.F., Recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult: A joint consensus statement of the American academy of sleep medicine and sleep research society (2015) Sleep; Engle-Friedman, M., The effect of sleep loss on next day effort (2003) J.

Hence, researchers have begun to put significant efforts into studying the direct and indirect benefits of wearable devices for health and wellbeing. This paper summarizes recent studies on the use of consumer wearable devices to improve physical activity, mental health, and health consciousness. Methods: A thorough literature search was performed from several reputable data-bases, such as PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, arXiv, and bioRxiv mainly using “wearable device research” as a keyword, no earlier than 2018. As a result, 25 of the most recent and relevant papers included in this review cover several topics, such as previous literature reviews (9 papers), wearable device accuracy (3 papers), self-reported data collection tools (3 papers), and wearable device intervention (10 papers). Results: All the chosen studies are discussed based on the wearable device used, complementary data, study design, and data processing method. All these previous studies indicate that wearable devices are used either to validate their benefits for general wellbeing or for more serious medical contexts, such as cardiovascular dis-orders and post-stroke treatment. Conclusions: Despite their huge potential for adoption in clinical settings, wearable device accuracy and validity remain the key challenge to be met. Some lessons learned and future projections, such as combining traditional study design with statistical and machine learning methods, are highlighted in this paper to provide a useful over-view for other researchers carrying out similar research. © 2020 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.","Exercise; Fitness Tracker; Medical Informatics; Mental Health; Wearable Electronic Device",,,,,"Kementerian Riset Teknologi Dan Pendidikan Tinggi Republik Indonesia","This study is funded by Directorate of Research and Community Service, Directorate General of Research and Development, Indonesian Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education as a part of 2019 Applied Excellent Research in Higher Education Grant.","(2019) IDC Reports Strong Growth in the Worldwide Wearables Market, Led by Holiday Shipments of Smart-Watches, Wrist Bands, and Ear-Worn Devices, , https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS44901819, Framingham (MA): IDC Corporate; [cited at 2020 Apr 15].

One of the most important coffeepre-processing, coffee bean roasting, is under developed in Indonesia. Indonesia coffee farmers prefer to use the traditional cauldron to roast their coffee beans. Roasting coffee beans using traditional cauldron is inefficient and resulting unequal roasted level for the coffee beans. In this study, we proposed atemperature control system based on fuzzy logic for coffee roaster machine. The system controls the temperature in accordance with the demanded roasting level. A thermal camera is attached inside the roasting chamber to monitor the heaton the roasted coffee beans. The thermal camera is integrated with a stirring mechanism to equalise the heat among the beans. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cameras; Computer circuits; Infrared devices; Coffee beans; Global demand; Indonesia; Roasted coffee; System control; Thermal camera; Fuzzy logic",,,,,,"(2019) Global Coffee Trade Statistic, , http://www.ico.org/trade_statistics.asp, International Coffee Organisation ICO [Online]; Feria-Morales, A.M., Examining the case of green coffee to illustrate the limitations of grading systems / expert tasters in sensory evaluation for quality control (2002) Food Qual.

Because this fish is known to have higher albumin fraction (64.61%) of protein and other economic values, domestication, and cultivation of this fish has been done in many Asian countries such as Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, and India. Environmental factors such as temperature, water pH, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, and turbidity are important parameters must be considered inbreeding and growing this type of fish. The aim of this paper is to propose an IoT solution to automatically monitor these environmental factors. It is designed with affordable and open-source electrical components to provide a cost-efficient solution for farmers. Five sensors are used to measure each parameter. A web application prototype is also presented as a companion application for the users to get useful information from the IoT device. It is developed using a Pythonframework. By accessing this web application, the users can immediately detect any abnormal conditions of the pond. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cultivation; Dissolved oxygen; Fish; Lakes; Abnormal conditions; Asian countries; Economic values; Electrical components; Environmental factors; Freshwater bodies; Total dissolved solids; WEB application; Internet of things",,,,,,"Haniffa, M.A.K., Jeya Sheela, P.A., Kavitha, K., Jais, A.M.M., Salutary value of haruan, the striped snakehead Channa striatus - A review (2014) Asian Pac.

With current computational power and algorithm, it is possi-ble to process big data, especially biomedical data, to find a complicated pattern with reasonable computation time. Computational approach for phosphorylation site prediction is more time-efficient and need fewer resources compared to traditional. However, the accuracy of current computational methods for phosphorylation site prediction still needs to be improved. This paper aims to create a computational method for phosphorylation site prediction with better classification performance compared to previous studies. The data used in this research to train the XGBoost models are extracted features from 2 different databases from the previous studies. The test result show that our model gave the highest accuracy on 4 out of 6 datasets. To extend our research, the XGBoost model was retrained which focused on 100 most important features from previous experiment. However, the result does not imply that it has a better result compared to our first models. As the result showing that our models gave better accuracy compared to the previous studies in most of the datasets, we can conclude that XGBoost model is better in predicting phosphorylation sites compared to other methods. © 2020 the author(s).","Gradient tree boosting; Phosphorylation; Post-translational modification; Prediction; Protein sequence; Proteomics; XGBoost",,,,,"Binus University","This research is a collaboration between the Department of Computer Science, University of Lampung, and Bioinformatics and Data Science Research Center (BDSRC), Bina Nusantara University.

The nature of dietary patterns of specific Indonesia population on the risk of colorectal cancer might differ from previously published data with the global population. Therefore, we conducted a study where the dietary pattern in colorectal cancer patient cohorts was compared to age- and population-matched control. We documented 89 colorectal cancer cases and among 173 individuals from the South Sulawesi population. A series of logistic regression and Fisher’s exact tests were utilized to test associations of dietary intakes and colorectal cancer risk as well as colorectal cancer staging. Our data demonstrate that vegetable (p-value = 8.70 × 10−26, OR = 0.49) and fruit (p-value = 7.59x10−5, OR = 0.70) intakes are associated with the reduced risk of colorectal cancer incidence. Conversely, acidic food, reheated food, meat, spicy food, and alcohol are associated with the increment case of cancer. Moreover, meat intake (p-value &lt; 0.01) shows a significant association with cancer staging progression. Common dietary pattern is a determinant aspect to the colorectal cancer incidence as well as its staging progression. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"Mundade, R., Imperiale, T.F., Prabhu, L., Loehrer, P.J., Lu, T., Genetic pathways, prevention, and treatment of sporadic colorectal cancer (2014) Oncoscience, 1 (6), pp. 400-406;

Its purpose was to determine the correlation between independent variables consisting of Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Attitude toward Using (AU) with dependent variable Behavioral Intention to Use (BIU). Data collection techniques were carried out by distributing questionnaires through group discussion forums. Respondents consisted of medical workers and health cadres both in Jakarta and Yogyakarta. Data were analyzed using correlation test and t-test. The results of the correlation test state that the correlation between PEU and AU is 0.30, which shows a weak correlation. Meanwhile, the correlation of PU and AU is 0.56, PEU and BIU is 0.41, and PU and BIU is 0.47, which are considered as moderate correlations. Finally, a strong correlation exists between AU and BIU. T-test results show that the effect of PU on AU is statistically significant with CI = 95%. Likewise, the effects of PEU on AU, AU towards BIU, PU towards BIU, and PEU towards BIU are significant (p < 0.05). © Kassel University Press GmbH.","Cancer early detection; Mobile learning; TAM",,,,,,,"Dyanti, G.A.R., Suariyani, N.L.P., Faktor-Faktor Keterlambatan Penderita Kanker Payudara Dalam Melakukan Pemeriksaan Awal Ke Pelayanan Kesehatan (2016) Jurnal Kesehatan Masyarakat, 11 (2), pp. 96-104. , https://doi.org/10.15294/kemas.v11i2.3742; Muljo, H.H., Perbangsa, A.S., Pardamean, B., Assessment of Online Learning Application for Health Education (2019) International Journal of Online and Biomedical Engineering, 15 (12), pp. 69-80. , https://doi.org/10.3991/ijoe.v15i12.11157; Setiati, E., (2009) Waspadai Empat Kanker Ganas Pembunuh Wanita, Kanker Rahim, Kanker Indung Telur, Kanker Leher Rahim, Kanker Payudara, , https://doi.org/10.18860/sains.v0i0.1862, Yokyakarta: Andi; Fernández, M.E., DeBor, M., Candreia, J.D.M., Dissemination of a breast and cervical cancer early detection program through a network of community-based organizations (2010) Health Promotion Practice, 11 (5), pp. 654-664. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839908325064; Ngoc Nguyen, T.-U., Tanjasiri, S.P., Kagawa-Singer, M., Tran, J.H., Foo, M.A., Community Health Navigators for Breast-and Cervical-Cancer Screening Among Cambodian and Laotian Women: Intervention Strategies and Relationship-Building Processes (2008) Health Promotion Practice, 9 (4), pp. 356-367. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839906290251; Muljo, H.H., Pardamean, B., Perbangsa, A.S., The implementation of online learning for early detection of cervical cancer (2017) Journal of Computer Science, 13 (11), pp. 600-607. , https://doi.org/10.3844/jcssp.2017.600.607; Davis, F.D., Perceived Usefullness, Perceived Ease of Use, and User Acceptance of Information Technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3). , https://doi.org/10.2307/249008; Quinn, C., (2000) MLearning, , Mobile, Wireless, In-Your-Pocket Learning.

Information transparency is needed to maintain good governance and can also prevent corruption. However, information on the sustainability of development programs carried out by the government is much unknown to the public. In addition, the government must be burdened with public dissatisfaction due to fake news (hoax). The Ministry of Public Works has tried to build a website to disseminate its programs. However, measurement of the quality of the website is needed. This study uses questionnaires with a Likert scale to obtain user interface assessment data in accordance with the WebQual 4.0 method. This study shows that the easiness of the website to use has the highest correlation with how helpful the website is. Public works ministry websites need to more frequently update valid information and promote transparency. The society also wants online complaint platform to make it easier to solve problems. © 2019 IEEE.","evaluation; government portal; user interface; WebQual","Knowledge management; Portals; Public works; Surveys; Transparency; Development programs; evaluation; Good governances; Government IS; Information transparency; Interface evaluation; Knowledge management portals; WebQual; User interfaces",,,,,,"Harris, M.L., (2011) Strategic Relationships in A Small Business Context: The Impact of Information Quality and Continuous Quality Improvement, , March; Palinkas, L.A., Horwitz, S.M., (2013) Purposeful Sampling for Qualitative Data Collection and Analysis in Mixed Method Implementation Research, , November; Campos, R., Jatowt, A., (2014) Survey of Temporal Information Retrieval and Related Applications, , October 2015; Ceri, S., Bozzon, A., Brambilla, M., Della Valle, E., Fraternali, P., Quarteroni, S., (2013) Web Information Retrieval.; Li, A.M., Yatrakis, P., Turner, D., Yen, B., Hsu, J., The relationship between internet usage and decision making: The case of information technology (it) managers in China (2003) J.

Protein phosphorylation is used to regulate various enzyme and receptor activations which include signal pathways. There have been many significant studies conducted to predict phosphorylation sites using various machine learning methods. Recently, several researchers claimed deep learning based methods as the best methods for phosphorylation sited prediction. However, the performance of these methods were backed up with the massive training data used in the researches. In this paper, we study the performance of simple deep neural network on the limited data generally used prior to deep learning employment. The result shows that a deep neural network can still achieve comparable performance in the limited data settings. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Many people think that they have already met the suggested guidelines. However, most of them were wrong when they quantify their activity level using a personal activity tracker device. This problem indicates the need for personal physical activity tracker or wearable device to maintain the fitness level. However, as wide-range wearable devices available today, it is difficult to find the most suitable one regarding the price and quality. This paper proposes a study to explore the association between the quality and the price of the devices. The quality is evaluated by comparing the accuracy of the heart rate sensor and step counter of several wearable devices with the ground truth measurements. The test result is then analyzed using a series of statistical methods including, a paired t-test, Pearson's correlation test, and Bland-Altman plot. Both t-test and correlation coefficient is used to plot the association between quality and price. © 2019 The Authors.

It is also an important task which aimed to reduce the confounding by ancestry on the relationship of genotypes and disease risk in assocation studies. Several methods have been developed to generate the best ancestry estimated scores even though some of them are still facing inefficient computation time. In this paper, a combination method between KMeans clustering and PCA is proposed estimate ancestry estimation from SNP genotyping data. This method was compared with baseline model, called fastSTRUCTURE, in term of the quality of clustering and computation time. Public data from 1000 Genome project is used to train and evaluate the proposed model and the baseline model. The proposed model can successfully generate clusters with better accuracy than fastSTRUCTURE (91.02% over 90.39%). More importantly, it can boost the computation time until 100 times faster than fastSTRUCTURE (from 490 seconds to 4.86 seconds). © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

These are known as polygenic models and are useful in evaluating risk of disease in patients. These models, however, often do not include important non-genetic factors that are important to the prediction of the disease. In this paper, we explore the prediction of colorectal cancer in Indonesia from non-genetic factors using common machine learning algorithms: XGBoost and Elastic Net. The result of this study identified 8 features with strong importance from both XGBoost and Elastic Net. We recommend including these features as covariates in future genetic association studies of colorectal cancer in Indonesia. Ultimately these models may be implemented as tools to screen patients for colorectal cancer risk. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

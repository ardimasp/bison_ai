How- ever, there are still limited survey papers that provide the indicators, methods, and the examples of the Smart City cases. This research aims to provide a systematic and com- prehensive survey using a systematic literature review method, on indicators, methods, and the examples of the Smart City cases. This literature review contributes to the foun- dation of the research in the area of Smart City. The method used in this paper is a sys- tematic and comprehensive literature review proposed by Ridley and Okoli & Schabram. The results show that Smart Environment is the most paramount indicator used in the literature. Moreover, some characteristics generally appear in the studies such as: Small scale implementation, the readiness of the laws & regulations as well as the technology. © 2020 ICIC International.

This created a rising demand on social media marketing. New breakthroughs in the field of artificial intelligence have enabled brand owners to boost social media marketing by knowing their target's demography. This study presents a model to predict gender of social media users based on comments section on Instagram profile by using AdaBoost, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes Classifier combined with a grid search and K- Fold validation. The model was trained with 40,000 comments and managed to get 78.64% on Naive Bayes, 73.41% on XGBoost, 74.56% on AdaBoost and 76.07% on SVM which are generally higher than related studies on this subject. This result shows that Naive Bayes produces higher accuracy on short text classification and has possibilities to help social media marketing. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

There are already several developed NERs dedicated to specific languages such as English, Vietnamese, German, Hindi and many others. However, our research focuses on Indonesian language. Our Indonesian NER is managed to extract the information from articles into 4 different classes; they are Person, Organization, Location, and Event. We provide comprehensive comparison among all experiments by using deep learning approaches. Some discussions related to the results are presented at the end of this paper. Through several conducted experiments, Indonesian NER has successfully achieved a good performance. © 2018 The Authors.

Noise is an unwanted component of the image. The existence of noise in a face image can degrade the accuracy of a face recognition. Therefore, we need a proper method that can cope noise or restore the quality of the image. The best method to overcome noise in the image is to use smoothing (filter). In this research, we discuss some techniques to overcome noise in face recognition task using Gabor and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), as it is stated in the previous research that it still cannot handle images with noise yet. The noises discussed in this research consist of impulse noise (salt-and-pepper), additive noise (Gaussian) and multiplicative noise (speckle). The experiment was conducted by using two face databases; they were ORL and Extended Yale B. The result said that mean filter is the best coping technique for Gabor and NMF face recognition methods. We used K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) as the classifier and it achieved 90.83% accuracy rate. © 2016 IEEE.","face recognition; filter; Gabor; NMF; noise","Additive noise; Factorization; Gabor filters; Impulse noise; Matrix algebra; Nearest neighbor search; Face recognition methods; filter; Gabor; Illumination effect; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Multiplicative noise; noise; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Face recognition",,,,,,"Olsson, T., Strengthening authentication with biometric technology (2003) GSEC Practical 1.4b, Option, 1. , August 26; Delac, K., Grgic, M., Bartlett, M.S., (2008) Recent Advances in Face Recognition, , Croatia: In-Tech; Purnomo, F., Suhartono, D., Shodiq, M., Susanto, A., Raharja, S., Kurniawan, R.W., Face recognition using Gabor Wavelet and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (2015) SAI Intelligent Systems Conference (IntelliSys), pp. 788-792. , IEEE, November; Rani, V., A brief study of various noise model and filtering techniques (2013) Journal of Global Research in Computer Science, 4 (4), pp. 166-171; Boncelet, C., Image Noise Models (2005) Handbook of Image and Video Processing, , Alan C.

Furthermore, to ensure this 'Smart City' aspects and their problems can be implemented in a game, so the game will be able to teach people about missed problem solving solutions. This research paper will discuss about the influence gained from playing a game upon city management skills, and careful planning on what must be done first, in order to maintain or increase the well-being of the citizen and the city welfare. By implementing real life applicable condition in the game which will be played by a person through a sandbox simulation style of gameplay, the player will be able to learn and experience certain types of city problems and the solutions to mitigate those problems without actually making it occur in a real city with real casualties, so it will be a safe vessel to gain new knowledge or to rediscover old effective methods, regarding city management, through a game. The results will portray, how can 'Smart City' aspects be implemented into a game, and how a city management simulation game can influence other people' actions on their city management knowledge. © 2017 The Authors.

They continue to look for ways that can ease their lives and it is up to the explanation of the visualization that closer to the actual visualization and support fast, precise and clear retrieval of interactive information. In order to realize the visualization, augmented reality technology is being used. Augmented reality is a technology that uses camera technology to recognize real world, images, objects, and environments and superimposes virtual information and data onto reality in real time. It combines a virtual object into two or three dimensions in a real three-dimensional environment. By developing an application with augmented reality, it can help user to look more detail into a product and give advantages to company to save the brochure production cost. The development of this application is using client-side and server-side, where the client-side will be run on android smartphone and server-side using a php based web service. The goal of this paper is to develop a 3D catalogue that helps to depict a product in interactive ways with zoom, rotate, choose color, and animation features. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.","3D Model; Android; Augmented Reality; Catalogue; Marker; Smartphone","Augmented reality; Manufacture; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Visualization; Web services; 3-d modeling; Android; Augmented reality technology; Catalogue; Interactive informations; Marker; Three-dimensional environment; Virtual information; Android (operating system)",,,,,,"Augmented Reality Metaio GmbH 2014, , http://www.metaio.com/technology/; Armigniani, J., Furht, B., Anisetti, M., Ceravolo, P., Damiani, E., Ivkovic, M., Augmented Reality Technology, Systems and Application (2010) Springer Science+Business Media, 51, pp. 341-377; (2014) Smartphone OS Market Share, p.

Face recognition is an example of authentication by using biometrics. Face recognition requires specific methods to obtain face representation as its features. There are many methods which have been developed to get these unique features, such as PCA, LDA, ICA and hybrid methods like ICA and SVM, Gabor and ICA and many others. This research develops a hybrid method from Gabor Wavelet and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) because during conducting literature reviews, the combination of these methods has never been found. The objective of this research is to create face recognition method with a better accuracy than the previous methods. Testing is conducted by using ORL face database and it gets around 95% accuracy rate. This result shows that the proposed method indicates a better accuracy compared with the previous methods. © 2015 IEEE.","Biometrics; Face Recognition; Gabor Wavelet; Non-negative Matrix Factorization; ORL Face Database","Authentication; Biometrics; Factorization; Intelligent systems; Matrix algebra; Biometrics authentication; Face recognition methods; Face representations; Gabor wavelets; Literature reviews; Nonnegative matrix factorization; ORL face database; Unique features; Face recognition",,,,,,"Jain, A.K., Flynn, P., Ross, A.A., (2008) Handbook of Biometrics, , 1st ed.

Analysis of future research topics by using a numerical approach based on scientific publications or patents have been previously done by several researchers mostly by classifying the topics based on the similarity of the documents. Meanwhile, time series analysis using statistical techniques, machine learning and logistic curves has also been conducted but for areas other than research topics. In this study, we will perform time series analysis to predict the topic of research by employing combination of machine learning approaches such as Neural Network, Extreme Learning Machine and Support Vector Machine. The prediction result is then finally refined by logistic curve. The dataset used in this study is a research report on Bioinformatics from Microsoft Research and NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information), over the past 30 years. Experimental result indicates that the combination of machine learning approaches and logistic-curve may improve the prediction accuracy. In addition, the emerging topic of the same dataset can be predicted with a relatively high average precision. Based on the dataset used, some emerging topics predicted for the next three years are 'Sequence Alignment', 'Index Terms', 'Secondary Structure', 'Nucleic Acid', and 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae'. © 2005 - 2013 JATIT & LLS.

The paper seeks to explore and understand the drivers of P2P lending sectors in Indonesia and to determine the challenges faced by the peer-to-peer lending sector in Indonesia by analyzing the three perspectives of this sector: users (lenders & borrowers), businesses, and regulator. A qualitative approach is used to collect and analyze data. The data is collected through open-ended and in-depth interviews with users, companies and government agency. A thematic analysis method using code mapping was developed during data analysis. The finding shows different results, from the regulator’s perspective, business lending users’ and borrowers’ views. Business opportunity and platform convenience are the drivers, policy risks and lending system are the challenges. The paper concludes there is still a potential sector in an early stage of development. Many improvements can be done through regulations, businesses approach (i.e., policy), and user participation in supporting small businesses. The findings found that OJK might be one party that has planned far in the future of P2P lending, such as the planning of users’ data privacy regulations, and regulations for P2P lending businesses that will not be too strict and still supports its innovation and development. Thus, with such changes, there could be more drivers and challenges in the future that can be explored.

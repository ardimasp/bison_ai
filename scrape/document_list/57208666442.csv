The majority of mall in Jakarta have difficulty to develop plan that enables to optimize their parking slots. Some malls use valet system to gain more profit or ease the customers, unfortunately the valet system price is quite expensive for major customers and it sounds unpopular. Therefore, many area of valet parking space is not maximized. The similar problems also faced by traditional parking system where it creates problems for customers such as difficult to find parking space, paper ticket missing and unable to locate car location. The purpose in this study is to propose a Smart Parking System (SPS) through the use of Internet of Things (IoT). The article applies smart parking system that enables online booking system, paperless ticket, cashless payments and automated guided parking. The objective of the article is expected to enhance the current online parking management system with IoT design, with the aim to be used as reference for parking management in malls. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Pardosi, T., (2016) STATISTIK TRANSPORTASI DKI Jakarta 2016, , Jakarta: BPS Provinsi DKI Jakarta; Wang, H., He, W., A reservation-based smart parking system (2011) Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)Conference on, pp. 690-695. , IEEE; Den Ardjuna, D., (2015) Internet of Thinks Methode and Implementation, p. 12. , rerasearch gate; Armstrong, E., (2015) Taking the U.

This involves planning, testing, tracking and reporting. Task management can help achieve individual goals, individual groups collaborate and share knowledge to achieve common goals. [1] Tasks are also distinguished by complexity, from low to high. Task management can form part of project management and process management for efficient workflows within an organization. Project managers who adhere to task-oriented management have a detailed and up-to-date project schedule, and a good team directs members and advances the project. [2] At present, the Task management system is growing along with the rapid advances in technology, so that anyone can access wherever he is. However, the majority of the current Task management system is not able to attract the attention and interest of its users. The concept of gamification will be applied to the ask management system so that work management is more organized, interesting and fun. This gamified system design will use the Marczewski's Gamification Framework. Framework that has user types with the needs of learning and self-development. Game mechanics in this user types such as levels, challenges, and rewards can support gamified system users in achieving goals. The tests that have been conducted show the success in applying the Marczewski framework to the functional needs of users. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Heiko, M., Van Der Aalst, M.P., Rickayzen, W., Riss, A., Uwe, V., Challenges for business processes and task management (2005) Journal of Universal Knowledge Management; Rich, B., 6 key elements for better Task Management (2005) Tech Republic; Nakayama, M., Chen, C.C., Impact of project management tools on project estimates and benefits (2016) International Conference on Internet Studies, p. 4; Andrzej, M., (2013) A Simple Gamification Framework, , http://marczewski.me.uk/gamification-framework/, diakses tanggal 3 Maret 2014; Zichermann, G., Cunningham, C., (2010) Gamification by Design: Implementing Game Mechanics in Web and Mobile Apps, , Sebastopol: O'Reilly Media; (2010) Gamification 101: An Introduction to the Use of Game Dynamics to Influence Behaviour, , http://www.bunchball.com/sites/default/files/downloads/gamification101.pdf, diakses tgl 2 Mei 2014",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd Nommensen International Conference on Technology and Engineering 2019, NICTE 2019","25 July 2019 through 26 July 2019",,157456,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Furthermore, share services and cloud computing solutions could helped modern higher education and universities to create low costs and efficient service management by collaboration and open environment. The creation off interconnected modern higher education ecosystem has become an important way for players in the field of education. This paper is to propose SOA adoption solutions for universities and education institutions by modelling and designing the interconnected modern higher education’s system. The aim is to create a new educational environment where learners have digital course and information accessible easily to support their educational and career goals. On the other hand, the solution is to understand the way universities and education institution solved demands complexity of the digital learning system by reducing investment costs. Moreover, we are purposing new alternatives of the architecture systems that focused on interoperability and cross-platform functionality in order to deal with high level components diversity. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","ELearning; Interconnected Modern Higher Education; Service Oriented Architecture SOA; Universities",,,,,,"Bak, H., Beyond the economy: Education for development (2018) Kasetsart J.

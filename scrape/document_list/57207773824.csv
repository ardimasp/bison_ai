One of the unexplored food sources is taro, which acts as promising starch sources for further studies in the fields of food science and also nanotechnology. Starch is a combination of amylose and amylopectin that forms polysaccharide (a type of carbohydrate), found in several tuber plants, with a competitive market share of 48.5 million tonnes, equals to 15 billion euro globally. Furthermore, there are a lot of potential of starch in the biotechnology and pharmacy fields, which are still employing starch in forms of nanoparticles as the supporting materials for the applications in tissue engineering, as excipients for tablets and drug delivery, along with possibility as a candidate for fat replacer. In this research starch particles were prepared via nanoprecipitation method by using NaOH, urea and ethanol. The precipitated starch particles were then dried via two different processes, which are inside a Petri dish (in an opened and a closed dish), in an atmospheric oven at 45°C for 16 h. The produced starch particles were characterized by using SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy). From this study, we have fabricated starch nanoparticles with the characteristic diameters of 203-596 μm (based on SEM analysis) via nanoprecipitation using NaOH, urea, and ethanol, which were dried in a closed Petri dish. Chemical characterization of that particular starch particles has shown that it is a hydrolyzed starch, having non-amorphous structure, with finger prints at wavenumbers of 3350 cm-1 and 1002 cm-1 based on FTIR analysis. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

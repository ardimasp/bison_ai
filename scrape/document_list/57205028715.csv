Violence can occur anywhere and everywhere its disturb the public and make the others worry. Despite the big problem of violence against women, the lack of solution and protection make it worse. This research objective was to present a solution for a better protection. This research is conducted by using data collection method through literature study and interview, also Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD). This analysis based on increasing number violence each year especially against women. So, by analysis and designing this application can help victim of violence by conducting rescue, protection and consultation. © 2018 IEEE.","mobile application; OOAD; violence victims on women","Information management; Data collection method; Literature studies; Mobile applications; Object oriented analysis and design; OOAD; Prototype designs; Research objectives; violence victims on women; Object oriented programming",,,,,"Harnoko, B.R., Dibalik tindak kekerasan terhadap perempuan (2010) Muwazah, pp. 181-188; Catatan Kekerasan Terhadap Perempuan Tahun 2017, Hal, p. 108. , National Commission on Violence Against Women (2018, Maret 7).

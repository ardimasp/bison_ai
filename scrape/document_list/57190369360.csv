However, this detection only can be felt as long as the length of the stick from its handle is as far as the reach of the hand. Seeing this limitation, a set of sonar vision was made using sonar sensor, which equipped as a wristwatch and a buckle of a belt. The sonar vision was designed to detect an obstacle for up to 3 meters away. A hundred low vision people already got the benefit of this system, which 84% of them felt that the sonar vision helped them in the navigation.

Plants need to capture photons as energy for photosynthesis in 400nm - 780nm spectrum. Different plant species will respond differently to specific light spectrum. Many studies have been done to find optimal light spectrum for plant growth, but there are still many researches to be done because there are still many combinations of light and plants species to be discovered. Specific light spectra combination is called light recipe. This research will help botanist to discover new light recipe for plant species by mixing 6 light spectra with individual intensity and time control. The developed grow light system has graphical user interface that run in Android tablet, and uses MQTT protocol for communication between android application and grow light system. Light recipe and setting are stored in database and the system also has light sensor to monitor light environmental conditions. Grow light consists of 6 types of 3W high power LED with specific color spectrum: Royal Blue, Deep Red, Ultraviolet, Full Spectrum, Far Red, and Natural White. Testing result shows that the system can produce uniform light distribution across the 50 x 50 cm grow area on average 22.6 μmol m-2s-1 using 60° lens. Germination result of lettuce using grow light shows good results compared to sunlight. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Artificial grow light; LED; MQTT; PAR","Android (operating system); Cultivation; Graphical user interfaces; Light emitting diodes; Android applications; Design and implementations; Environmental conditions; High power LED; Leafy vegetables; Light distribution; MQTT; Vegetative growth; Light",,,,"Binus University: 109/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019, 23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019, 038/VR","This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia, as a part of National Competitive Research Grant to Binus University titled “Integrated Hydroponic Automation System Design using Real Time OS based on ARM Cortex-M Microcontroller” with contract number: 109/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019, 23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019, 038/VR.RTT/IV/2019.","Kozai, T., Fujiwara, K., Runkle, E.S., (2016) LED Lighting for Urban Agriculture; Darkó, É., Heydarizadeh, P., Schoefs, B., Sabzalian, M., Photosynthesis under artificial light: The shift in primary and secondary metabolism (2014) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series B, Biological Sciences, 369; Snowden, M., Cope, K., Bugbee, B., Sensitivity of Seven Diverse Species to Blue and Green Light: Interactions with Photon Flux (2016) PLOS ONE, 11; Bantis, F., Ouzounis, T., Radoglou, K., Artificial LED lighting enhances growth characteristics and total phenolic content of Ocimum basilicum, but variably affects transplant success (2016) Scientia Horticulturae, 198; Byun, A., Mao, M., Sidhu, R., The Effect of Different Wavelenghts on the Germination time of Arabidopis thaliana wild type and mutant type seeds (2013) The Expedition, 3; Demotes, S., Péron, T., Corot, A., Bertheloot, J., Gourrierec, J., Travier, S., Crespel, L., Sakr, S., Plant responses to red and far-red lights, applications in horticulture (2015) Environmental and Experimental Botany, 309; Deram, P., Lefsrud, M., Orsat, V., Supplemental Lighting Orientation and Red-to-blue Ratio of Light-emitting Diodes for Greenhouse Tomato Production (2014) HortScience, 49; Hernández, R., Kubota, C., Tomato seedling growth and morphological responses to supplemental LED lighting red: Blue ratios under varied daily solar light integrals (2012) Acta Horticulturae, 956; Huché, L., Crespel, L., Gourrierecb, J., Morela, P., Light signaling and plant responses to blue and UV radiations - Perspectives for applications in horticulture (2016) Environmental and Experimental Botany, 121, pp. 22-28; Kopsell, D., Sams, C., Morrow, R., Blue Wavelengths from LED Lighting Increase Nutritionally Important Metabolites in Specialty Crops (2015) HortScience, 50","Atmadja, W.; Computer Engineering Department, Jl.

The location that is in the closed area and consists of lots of room to play therein will have many challenges when it is developed by using the Global Positioning System (GPS). In the developed system is also necessary to know the location of the children monitored in real time. The use of Radio Frequency ID (RFID) is expected to answer the needs mentioned above. The system developed consists of RFID readers that is installed at the entrance or exit, RFID tags that is carried by the child, a database server that is used to upload data from RFID readers and also an application that is installed on a smart phone that is used to upload the registration data to the database server and download data from the database server to be displayed on the smartphone. Application that is developed to build this system is also equipped with other features such as user info and add friend. User info is used to determine the time of the last tapping did by the child. Add Friend is used to add a child that is to be monitored into the system. In this application, the number of children that can be monitored is limited to 5 children. With accuracy up to 100% at the time of tapping and mapping, systems and applications are developed is reliable to answer the needs. © 2017 ACM.","Android smart phone; RFID; System monitoring","Android (operating system); Broadband networks; Database systems; Global positioning system; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Signal encoding; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Android smart phones; Android smartphone; Data-base servers; Monitoring system; Radio Frequency ID (RFID); RFID readers; RFID sensors; System monitoring; Monitoring",,,,,,"Miskelly, F., Electronic tracking of patients with dementia and wandering using mobile phone technology (2005) Age and Ageing, 34 (5), pp. 497-518; Nicholson, R.J., Brown, T.G., Caracciolo, A., Jr., Scribner, J.R., Tracking system (1991) Software US 5014206 A, , May 7; Elgethun, K., Yost, M.G., Fitzpatrick, C.T.E., Nyerges, T.L., Fenske, R.A., Comparison of global positioning system (GPS) tracking and parent-report diaries to characterize children's time-location patterns (2006) Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology, 17, pp. 196-206. , June; Van Der Spek, S., Van Schaick, J., De Bois, P., De Haan, R., Sensing human activity: GPS tracking (2009) Sensors, 9 (4), pp. 3033-3055. , April; Zhang, D., Xia, F., Yang, Z., Yao, L., Zhao, W., Localization techonolgy for indoor human tracking (2010) 5th International Conference on Future Information Technology (Future Tech), pp. 1-6. , Busan; Werb, J., Lanzl, C., Designing a positioning system for finding things and people indoors (1998) IEEE Spectrum, 35 (9), pp. 71-78. , September; Gu, Y., Lo, A., Niemegeers, I., A survey of indoor positioning systems for wireless personal networks (2009) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 11 (1), pp. 13-32. , March; Ran, L., Helal, S., Moore, S., Drishti: An integrated indoor/Outdoor blind navigation system and service (2004) The Second IEEE Annual Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications, pp. 23-30; Zaruba, G.V., Huber, M., Kamangar, F.A., Chlamtac, I., Indoor location tracking using RSSI readings from a single wi-fi access point (2007) Journal Wireless Networks, 13 (2), pp. 221-235. , April; Renaudin, V., Yalak, O., Tomé, P., Merminod, B., Indoor navigation of emergency agents (2007) European Journal of Navigation, 5 (3), pp. 1-10. , July; Jin, G.-Y., Lu, X.-Y., Park, M.-S., An indoor localization mechanism using active RFID tag (2006) IEEE International Conference on Sensor Networks, Ubiquitous, and Trustworthy Computing, , Taichung; Tsuboi, T., Shiraishi, T., Komuro, N., Indoor human positioning tracking technique to support high-quality life (2009) International Joint Conference, pp. 5745-5749. , Japan; Gupta, A.K., Katiyar, S., Kumar, N., Railway track finding system with RFID application (2013) International Journal of Computer Aplication, 836 (7), pp. 24-30. , December; Gerdisen, Y., Solid, V., Wahyudi, O., Hutabarat, D.P., Hedwig, R., Human tracking in a certain closed area based on global positioning system (GPS) (2014) Internetworking Indonesia Journal, 6 B (1), pp. 3-6",,,"","Association for Computing Machinery","5th International Conference on Communications and Broadband Networking, ICCBN 2017","20 February 2017 through 22 February 2017",,128004,,9781450348614,,,"English","ACM Int.

However the implementation can be limited by the calculation power available in the vehicle. This paper reports an improvement of our previous approach while keeping the processing power low. The algorithm proposed in this paper avoid heavy pixel-by-pixel image processing of the captured image, it works mostly on the detected line segments instead of the image. The proposed algorithm is also more global, capable in recognizing multiple lane markers and estimating the position of the vehicle on a multi-lane road. The algorithm is evaluated using miniature road and miniature vehicle for various poses. The recognition rate and the estimation accuracy are shown to be much higher with only 1% failure rate compared to the previous approach in [12] or [13].","Hough transform; Inverse perspective mapping; Multi-lane recognition; Vehicle pose estimation",,,,,,,"Guzzella, L., The Automobile of the Future -Option for Efficient Individual Mobility,"" IEEE Control Applications, (CCA) & Intelligent Control, (ISIC).

The CS also provides a mechanism for data security (encryption) because the signal can only be reconstructed if the dictionary and the sensing matrix are known. This technique is better compared to the conventional technique because the compression and encryption is done simultaneously through the signal projection into the sensing matrix. Moreover the signal projection into the sensing matrix is relatively simple and doesn't need heavy computational load so it will be very effective to implement in a portable device. We proposed a scheme of simultaneous image compression-encryption based on CS by using a novel method of optimized sensing matrix. The simulation results showed that by using optimized sensing matrix improved the quality of reconstructed image compared with random sensing matrix that is usually used in CS-based encryption. © 2013 IEEE.","Compressive Sensing; encryption; sensing matrix","Artificial intelligence; Signal reconstruction; Compressive sensing; Computational loads; Conventional techniques; Image encryptions; Portable device; Quality of reconstructed images; Signal projection; Cryptography",,,,,,"Donoho, D.L., (2006) Compressed Sensing, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 52 (4), pp. 1289-1306. , Apr; Candès, E.J., Romberg, J., Tao, T., Robust uncertainty principles: Exact signal reconstruction from highly incomplete frequency information (2006) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 52 (2), pp. 489-509. , Feb; Candès, E., Romberg, J., Tao, T., Stable signal recovery from incomplete and inaccurate measurements (2006) Comm.

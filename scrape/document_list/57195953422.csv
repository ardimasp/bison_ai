Differentiated instruction (DI) is put forward as a key solution but seems challenging. In this study, actual DI implementation of teachers is linked to a complex set of variables: teachers' DI self-efficacy, teaching beliefs, teaching experience, professional development, teacher certification, and classroom size. The findings show that DI implementation seems high, but is still below a critical benchmark. The regression analysis results indicate 39% of the variation in DI implementation which can significantly linked to DI self-efficacy beliefs, higher constructivist beliefs and higher classroom size. Research implications are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Differentiated instruction; Indonesia; Teachers' self-efficacy; Teaching beliefs; Teaching strategy",,,,,,"The authors thank to colleagues in Bina Nusantara University Indonesia for the valuable support in field data collection.

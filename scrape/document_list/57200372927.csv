The present study deals with the influence of variation of O2 gas admixing to the Ar plasma discharge to examine the decolorization of methylene blue solution underwater through measurement of absorbance value of the plasma-treated solution by UV/VIS measurement. From the experiments it was found that the best result of methylene blue solution decomposition was obtained from the application of Ar 0.3 lpm with the admixing of O2 gas 0.3 lpm in an underwater plasma system generated at 1.56 kV. Modelling the decomposition process of methylene blue by using Ar+O2 plasma with variation of O2 flow rate, it was found that the system was confirmed to follow the first order kinetics equation. From this study it could be said that the plasma-based oxidation process is promising for the application in the decomposition of textile wastewater to support sustainable industry with environmentally friendly orientation. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The plasma itself was generated by an in-house high voltage power supply (HVPS). Instead of gas-phase plasma system, we applied plasma jet system underwater during wastewater treatment without additional any chemicals (chemical-free processing). The method is thought to maximize the energy transfer and increase the efficient interaction between plasma and solution during the process. Our plasma jet system could proceed either by using helium (He), argon (Ar) and air as the medium in an open air atmosphere. Exploring the developed plasma to be applied in organic wastewater treatment, we demonstrated that the plasma jet could be generated underwater and yields in color degradation of methylene blue (MB) wastewater model. When using Ar gas as a medium, the color degradation of MB could be achieved within 90 minutes. Whereas, by using Ar with an admixing of oxygen (O2) gas, the similar result could be accomplished within 60 minutes. Additional O2 gas in the latter might produce more hydroxyl radicals and oxygen-based species which speed up the oxidative reaction with organic pollutants, and hence accelerate the process of color degradation. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","color degradation; non-thermal plasma; organic pollutant; wastewater treatment","Aromatic compounds; Color; Energy transfer; Indicators (chemical); Plasma jets; Pollution; Reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Color degradation; Efficient interaction; High voltage power supply; Hydroxyl radicals; Nonthermal plasma; Organic wastewater treatment; Oxidative reaction; Plasma jet system; Organic pollutants",,,,"0422/K3/KM/2017","The author would like to acknowledge the financial support from Indonesia Ministry of Research Technology and Higher Education through the Research Grant Number: 0422/K3/KM/2017.","Vineta, S., Silvana, Z., Sanja, R., Golomeova, S., Methods for Waste Waters Treatment in Textile Industry (2014) International Scientific Conference, 3, pp. 248-252; Abdelmalek, F., Ghezzar, M.R., Belhadj, M., Addou, A., Brisset, J.L., Bleaching and Degradation of Textile Dyes by Nonthemal Plasma Process at Atmospheric Pressure (2006) Industrial and Engineering Chemical Research, 45 (1), pp. 23-29; Tichonovas, M., Krugly, E., Racys, V., Hippler, R., Kauneliene, V., Stasuilaitiene, I., Martuzevicius, D., Degradation of various textile dyes as wastewater pollutants under dielectric barrier discharge plasma treatment (2013) Chemical Engineering Journal, 229, pp. 9-19; Kasih, T.P., Investigation of the Non-Thermal Plasma-Based Advanced Oxidation Process for Removal of Organic Contaminants in Azo Dyes Solution (2017) Journal of Ecological Engineering, 18 (2), pp. 1-6; Reddy, M.K., Bendi, R., Reddy, L., Challapalli, S., Degradation and mineralization of methylene blue by dielectric barrier dicharge non-rhermal plasma (2013) The Chemical Engineering Journal, 217, pp. 41-47; Ma, Y., Gong, X., He, B., Li, X., Cao, D., Li, J., Xiong, Q., Li, Q.H., (2017) On the Estimation of the Dissolved Hydroxyl Radicals in the Plasma-liquid System Using the Molecular Probe Method; Nehra, V., Kumar, A., Dwivedi, H.K., Atmospheric Non-Thermal Plasma Sources (2008) International Journal of Engineering, 2, pp. 53-68; Foster, J.E., Plasma-based water purification: Challenges and prospects for the future (2017) Physics of Plasma, 24 (5)","Kasih, T.P.; Industrial Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: tkasih@binus.edu","Kasih T.P.","","Institute of Physics Publishing","International Conference on Eco Engineering Development 2017, ICEED 2017","14 November 2017 through 15 November 2017",,133427,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

As the dyeing process produce tons of effluents, the re-dyeing process multiplies the number. The re-dyeing process will be done when the expected color not reached that caused by the improper setting of parameters. The waste of these processes could threaten the environment. In this paper, we utilize Taguchi methods and ANOVA to obtain the optimum conditions of a dyeing process at XYZ company and to gain the percentage of contributions of each parameter. To confirm the optimum conditions obtained by using the Taguchi Method, verification test was carried out to inspect the similarity between predicted output and five experiments under the optimal conditions and the result was confirmed. The optimum conditions for a dyeing process are dye concentration 3.5%; Na2SO4 concentration 80g/l; Na2CO3 concentration 5.8 g/l; and temperature at 80°C. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","ANOVA; Dyeing Process; S/N Ratio; Taguchi Method; Textile Industry","Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Effluents; Knit fabrics; Sodium compounds; Sulfur compounds; Taguchi methods; Textile finishing; Textile industry; Textile processing; Textiles; Dye concentration; Dyeing process; Finishing operation; Optimal conditions; Optimum conditions; S/N ratio; Setting of parameters; Verification tests; Dyeing",,,,,,"Bahrdwaj, V., Fairhurst, A., Fast fashion: Response to changes in the fashion industry (2010) The International Review of Retail, Distribution and Consumer Research, 20 (1), pp. 165-173; Chequer, F.M.D., Rodrigues De Oliveira, G.A., Anastácio Ferraz, E.R., Cardoso, J.C., Boldrin Zanoni, M.V., Palma De Oliveira, D., Textile Dyes: Dyeing Process and Environmental Impact (2013) Eco-Friendly Textile Dyeing and Finishing, p. 151; Couto, S.R., Dye removal by immobilised fungi (2009) Biotechnol Adv, 27 (3), pp. 227-235; Özbay, N., Yargiç, A.S., Yarbay-Şahin, R.Z., Önal, E., Full Factorial Experimental Design Analysis of Reactive Dye Removal by Carbon Adsorption (2013) Journal of Chemistry, 2013, p. 1; Rao, S.R., Padmanabhan, G., Application of Taguchi methods and ANOVA in optimization of process parameters for metal removal rate in electrochemical machining of Al/5%SiC composites (2012) International Journal of Engineering Research and Application (IJERA), 2, pp. 192-197; Zhang, J.Z., Chen, J.C., Kirby, E.D., Surface roughness optimization in and end-milling operation using the Taguchi design method (2007) Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 184 (1-3), pp. 233-239; Xin, J.H., (2006) Total Colour Management in Textiles, , (Washington DC: CRC Press); Asiltürk, I., Akkus, H., Determining the effect of cuting parameters on surface rougness in hard turning using the Taguchi method (2011) Measurement, 44, pp. 1697-1704; Ghani, J., Choudhury, I., Hassan, H., Application of Taguchi method in the optimization of end milling parameters (2004) Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 145 (1), pp. 84-92; Hossain, I., Hossain, A., Choudhury, I.A., Dyeing process parameters optimisation and colour strength prediction for viscose/lycra blended knitted fabrics using Taguchi method (2015) The Journal of the Textile Institute, pp. 154-164; Asghar, A., Abdul Raman, A.A., Wan Daud, W.M.A., A Comparison of Central Composite Design and Taguchi Method for Optimizing Fenton Process (2014) The Scientific World Journal, 2014. , 2014; Montgomery, D.C., Runger, G.C., (2014) Applied Statistics and Probability for Engineers, , 6 (Singapore: John Wiley amp; Sons Singapore)","Kasih, T.P.; Industrial Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: tkasih@binus.edu","Kasih T.P.","","Institute of Physics Publishing","International Conference on Eco Engineering Development 2017, ICEED 2017","14 November 2017 through 15 November 2017",,133427,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The limited carrying capacity of land in the supply of nutrients must be balanced with the addition of nutrients through fertilization. Ideally, the application of fertilization is site specific, but it is unfortunate that the cost constraints cause location-specific fertilization doses cannot be obtained immediately. The purpose of this study is to develop an Android-based fertilizer application to simulate the availability and loss of nutrients in the care or cultivation of oil palm. The Hydrometer method was used to carry out soil structure analysis. Data on the amount of nutrients stored and released from fertilizer applications was modeled with the help of the stock and flow diagram method. The stock and flow diagram method was used to determine the effect of the amount of fertilizer introduced on nutrients stored in the main crop and the large amount of fertilizer that was evaporated, runoff, and deviated. Furthermore, this method was able to predict the amount of nutrition during fertilization (1 semester). The results of this study are in the form of an Android-based application which is compiled based on the calculation scheme obtained from the Stock and Flow Diagram. © 2020 IEEE.","Fertilizer loss; Precision agriculture; Soil","Android (operating system); Fertilizers; Flowcharting; Information management; Palm oil; Runoff; Calculation scheme; Cost constraints; Fertilizer applications; Growth and development; Large amounts; Nutrient elements; Site-specific; Soil-structure analysis; Nutrients",,,,,,,"Suwarno, D.P.P., Technosol tanah masa depan (review) (2018) AGROISTA Jurnal Agroteknologi, 2 (1), pp. 93-107. , https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.34083.71208; Saragih, D.P.P., Ma'As, A., Notohadisuwarno, S., Various soil types, organic fertilizers and doses with growth and yields of stevia rebaudiana bertoni m (2019) Jurnal Ilmu Pertanian, 3 (1). , https://doi.org/10.22146/ipas.33176; Pahan, I., (2011) Panduan Lengkap Kelapasawit Manajemen Agribisnis Dari Hulur Hingga Hilir, , Bogor: Penebar Swadaya; Arsyad, A.R., Junedi, H., Yulfita, F., Pemupukan kelapa sawit berdasarkan potensi produksi untuk meningkatkan hasil tandan buah segar (tbs) pada lahan marginal kumpeh (2012) Jurnal Penelitian Universitas Jambi Seri Sains, 14 (1), pp. 29-36; Haryanti, A., Norsamsi, P.S.F., Sholiha, N.F., Studi pemanfaatan limbah padat kelapa sawit (2014) Konversi, 3 (2), pp. 20-29; De Datta, S.K., Advances in soil fertility research and nitrogen fertilizer management for lowland rice (1987) Efficiency of Nitrogen Fertilizer for Rice, pp. 27-41. , Manila: International Rice Research Institute; Bimantio, P.M., Effect of grain size and activation time of zeolite to adsorption and desorption of nh4oh and kcl as model of fertilizer-zeolite mix (2017) Jurnal Konversi, 6 (2), pp. 20-27; Bimantio, P.M., Saragih, D.P.P., Benefisiasi prarancangan proses pengolahan pupuk granul slow release Dari urea dan zeolit (2018) PROSIDING SEMINAR INSTIPER TAHUN 2018 Perkembangan Penelitian INSTIPER Dalam Menanggapi Era Teknologi Maju Bidang Perkebunan i, pp. 103-115. , A.

One of the most important coffeepre-processing, coffee bean roasting, is under developed in Indonesia. Indonesia coffee farmers prefer to use the traditional cauldron to roast their coffee beans. Roasting coffee beans using traditional cauldron is inefficient and resulting unequal roasted level for the coffee beans. In this study, we proposed atemperature control system based on fuzzy logic for coffee roaster machine. The system controls the temperature in accordance with the demanded roasting level. A thermal camera is attached inside the roasting chamber to monitor the heaton the roasted coffee beans. The thermal camera is integrated with a stirring mechanism to equalise the heat among the beans. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cameras; Computer circuits; Infrared devices; Coffee beans; Global demand; Indonesia; Roasted coffee; System control; Thermal camera; Fuzzy logic",,,,,,,"(2019) Global Coffee Trade Statistic, , http://www.ico.org/trade_statistics.asp, International Coffee Organisation ICO [Online]; Feria-Morales, A.M., Examining the case of green coffee to illustrate the limitations of grading systems / expert tasters in sensory evaluation for quality control (2002) Food Qual.

It is also an important task which aimed to reduce the confounding by ancestry on the relationship of genotypes and disease risk in assocation studies. Several methods have been developed to generate the best ancestry estimated scores even though some of them are still facing inefficient computation time. In this paper, a combination method between KMeans clustering and PCA is proposed estimate ancestry estimation from SNP genotyping data. This method was compared with baseline model, called fastSTRUCTURE, in term of the quality of clustering and computation time. Public data from 1000 Genome project is used to train and evaluate the proposed model and the baseline model. The proposed model can successfully generate clusters with better accuracy than fastSTRUCTURE (91.02% over 90.39%). More importantly, it can boost the computation time until 100 times faster than fastSTRUCTURE (from 490 seconds to 4.86 seconds). © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

These are known as polygenic models and are useful in evaluating risk of disease in patients. These models, however, often do not include important non-genetic factors that are important to the prediction of the disease. In this paper, we explore the prediction of colorectal cancer in Indonesia from non-genetic factors using common machine learning algorithms: XGBoost and Elastic Net. The result of this study identified 8 features with strong importance from both XGBoost and Elastic Net. We recommend including these features as covariates in future genetic association studies of colorectal cancer in Indonesia. Ultimately these models may be implemented as tools to screen patients for colorectal cancer risk. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

One of its latest development is wearable device technology. Nowadays, the growth of this technology market is very positive. But unfortunately the growth of this technology is not followed by the availability of supporting applications that provide maximum benefits for users by utilizing personal health and activity data. This paper is intended to provide a report of our initial research in developing a health assistant solution that utilizes wearable device generated data. The whole research process is executed using Design Thinking approach that put the users as the main consideration.

Eighty-five fifth-grade students were assigned to either an experimental or control Logo group. They were pre-tested to assess baseline receptiveness to figural and logical word problem-solving skills. After eight weeks of learning, the Logo experimental group had significantly higher scores than the control group on the problem-solving skills tests (assessing both figural and logical word problem-solving skills). The result revealed significant differences in the figural problem-solving skill between the Logo experimental and control groups. An implication was that Logo programming exercised skills are more critical and relevant to the figural problem-solving skill.

Most endeavors have been inefficient, rendering an objective of determining the initial steps that could be taken to improve these efforts by assessing a student population's computer skill levels and performances in an IT course. Demographic factors were also taken into account while formulating these recommendations. Basic computer skill levels were measured through the administration of the Technical Survival Skill Test (TSST) questionnaire, developed by the University of Toronto. Academic performances were evaluated through several assignments designed by the IT course instructors. The main result of this study indicated that computer skill levels did have a direct correlation with a student's academic performance level. The database was further parsed based on demographical factors, resulting in a set of recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of e-learning. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.","Learning management system; LMS; Technical survival skill test; TSST",,,,,,,,"Anderson, T., Toward a Theory of Online Learning (2004) Theory and Practice of Online Learning, pp. 33-60. , In T.

This new approach required students' active construction of knowledge as both an individual and team. Students were asked to begin their studies through the viewing of digital models in videos through an online learning portal. Camtasia Studio was utilized in creating video contains class material and experiments along with the teacher's audio explanation. The TBL approach was implemented as the instructional strategy during in-class sessions. A portion of the classroom time was spent ensuring that students master the class material and a vast majority of class time was used for team assignments that focused on problem-based learning and simulating complex questions that the student would face as the course developed. The utilization of digital models and TBL improved the students' ability to learn independently and to present their ideas coherently, transforming them into more engaged, independent learners, not just in science learning but also in their overall academic experience. © 2014 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","digital model; science teaching; TBL; Team-Based Learning","Communication systems; Students; Teaching; Complex questions; Digital model; Instructional strategy; Problem based learning; Science learning; Science teaching; TBL; Team-based learning; Information technology",,,,,,,"Hasil, P.K.D.P., Pembelajaran IPA dan Matematika di Sekolah Dasar, 2. , http://jurnal.fkip.uns.ac.id/index.php/pgsdkebumen/.../208, Puput Eriska W. 3, Dedi, PN 4, Uswatun Khasanah 5 PGSD FKIP Universitas Sebelas Maret.

In this study, the experimental group used the blended-learning method while the control group used the conventional learning method. Blended learning is defined as a combination between e-learning with LMS and conventional learning. T-test and Pearson's correlation analyses were performed. T-test method was used in order to determine the significant difference of scores between the experimental and the control groups. The result demonstrated that students in the experimental group performed significantly better than those in the control group. The pre-test scores in algebra, calculus, and discrete mathematics showed no significant differences across the board, demonstrating the homogeneity among both groups' participants. Furthermore, the study also utilized the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to measure user acceptance of the system. It was found that TAM can be considered as a valid instrument to assess the user acceptance of a system which in this study was the application of graph theory in LMS environment on a subject course at higher education level. © 2005 - 2013 JATIT & LLS.

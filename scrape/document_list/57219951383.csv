Joglo-roofed buildings are still very popular in Indonesia, especially for the people of Central Java. Joglo roof is a roof that has two different slope angles, and has a partner on the other side of the mirror. The angle in the meeting of two roofs on the same side must be greater than 180O. Unsteadystate heat equations can represent temperature distribution in joglo-roofed buildings. Using a finite difference scheme with the ghost point method that is solved numerically and uses the Quadratic Extrapolation approach, unsteady-state heat equations can be solved. The results of this simulation aim to be a reference that can be used by construction industry workers in the construction of buildings that have a joglo roof. This research results in the fact that the longer the time given, the high temperature value will decrease by itself due to heat distribution. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Numerous algorithms were developed for the purpose of tracking, e.g. Kalman Filter, particle-filter, and Meanshift. However, utilizing only one of these algorithms is considered inefficient because all single algorithms have their limitations. We proposed an improved algorithm which combines these three traditional algorithms to cover each algorithms drawbacks. Moreover we also utilized a combination of two features which are color histogram and texture to increase the accuracy. Results show that the method proposed in this paper is robust to cope with numerous issues, e.g. illumination variation, object deformation, non linear movement, similar color interference, and occlusion. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm show better results compare to other comparator algorithms. © 2019 The Authors.

The existence of several problems such as illumination variation, tracking non-rigid object, non-linear motion, occlusion, and requirement of real time implementation has made tracking as one of the challenging tasks in computer vision. In this paper a tracking algorithm which combines mean-shift and particle-Kalman filter is proposed to overcome above mentioned problems. The purpose of this combination is to draw each algorithm's strength points and cover each algorithms drawbacks. In the proposed method, mean-shift is used as master tracker when the target object is not occluded. When occlusion is occurred or the mean-shift tracking result is not convincing, particle-Kalman filter will act as master tracker to improve the tracking results. Experimental results of the proposed method show desirable performance in tracking objects under several above mentioned problems. © 2017 The Authors.

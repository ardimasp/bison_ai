The Indonesian government has introduced a universal coverage system that adopts Diagnosis Related Group (DRG), namely Indonesia Case Base Group (INA- CBG). INA-CBG is used to improve the service of healthcare providers and integrate user data into one database. Hence, there is a possibility of security gaps in protecting data from unauthorized users. Therefore, an analysis was performed based on the regulation published in Indonesia and the current INA-CBG system. A security lattice model of access control was produced to set constraints to prevent data privacy from being retrieved by unauthorized users. There are five security level categorizations as follows: Public, Research, Clinical, Financial, and Provider. Each security level was assigned to 26 attributes which are components of the current INA-CBG system. Furthermore, a simulation has been performed based on the model developed to ensure that the assigned level is correct. The results of the simulation will be used as a reference in determining the security lattice of each attribute if the result shows there are inappropriate levels. © 2020 ICIC International.","DRG; INA-CBG; Security lattice; Security level; Universal coverage system",,,,,,"Teoh, T.-T., Nguwi, Y.-Y., Elovici, Y., Ng, W.-L., Thiang, S.-Y., Analyst intuition inspired neural network based cyber security anomaly detection (2018) International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 14 (1), pp. 379-386; Zhang, D., Big data security and privacy protection (2018) Proc. of the 8th International Conference on Management and Computer Science (ICMCS 2018); Jayabalan, M., O'daniel, T., Access control and privilege management in electronic health record: A systematic literature review (2016) Journal of Medical Systems, 40 (12); Green, M., Smith, M., Developers are not the enemy!: The need for usable security apis (2016) IEEE Security & Privacy, 14 (5), pp. 40-46; Archenaa, J., Anita, E.

A framework was proposed for defining a fair algorithm metric by compiling information and propositions from various papers into a single summarized list of fairness requirements (guideline alike). The researcher can then adopt it as a foundation or reference to aid them in developing their interpretation of algorithmic fairness. Therefore, future work for this domain would have a more straightforward development process. We also found while structuring this framework that to develop a concept of fairness that everyone can accept, it would require collaboration with other domain expertise (e.g., social science, law, etc.) to avoid any misinformation or naivety that might occur from that particular subject. That is because this field of algorithmic fairness is far broader than one would think initially; various problems from the multiple points of view could come by unnoticed to the novice’s eye. In the real world, using active discriminator attributes such as religion, race, nation, tribe, religion, and gender become the problems, but in the algorithm, it becomes the fairness reason. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Educational institutions that provide open networks and connected to many devices simultaneously become an exciting testing ground for cybercriminals. Anti-virus is often used as prevention by applying signature-based detection of specific tiles contained in the database. Unfortunately, because much new malware continues to grow, the detection of the database becomes inaccurate. Therefore, automatic detection has been carried out using Autoencoder hybridized with ANN and CNN approaches. It will be developed using Python programming language with computer specification of 16GB RAM and Processor i7-7500U. Samples used are malware dataset obtained from various types of repositories such as virussign.com, the Zoo, and certain libraries from researchers. The dimensions of samples will be reconstructed using Autoencoder to generate new values that will be used as input on ANN and CNN. This research also has been developed Principal Component Analysis as a comparison architecture. Those approaches provide outstanding results in detecting malware, scilicet PCA-ANN with an accuracy of 0.985, PCACNN with an accuracy of 0.963, Autoencoder -ANN with an accuracy of 0.994, and Autoencoder -CNN with an accuracy of 0.970. Therefore, those approaches can be used as reference in increasing the need for educational institutions to improve their security from malware by detecting tiles that will be sent or read by each user. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial;

However, to maintain credibility, trust from the public on service and learning capabilities as well as recognition extensively are needed. To measure capability in service and learning can be displayed by the technology used during all activities at the university. In this study, an analysis was conducted on the influence of ICT and Public Recognition on University Credibility by using Multiple Linear Regression test. The data used are questionnaire with 13 items representing three variables, namely Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Public Recognition, and University Credibility. Each instrument that is distributed and obtained was used to test the validity and reliability of the items. The results show that 61% of ICT and Public Recognition are proved to influence the credibility of the university. This shows that ICT and Public Regulations play a significant role in showing University Credibility where this can be used as a benchmark in improving good perceptions of university selection. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Credibility; ICT; Public; Recognition; Regression","Linear regression; Credibility; Information and Communication Technologies; Learning capabilities; Multiple linear regressions; Public; Recognition; Regression; Database systems",,,,,"Freeman, R.B., What does global expansion of higher education mean for the United States?

However the threat of Hoax is also increasing in social media which increase the risk of mass panic, where the society become confuse between false and true, other words between hoax and not hoax. To mitigate the effect of hoax, a system to filter out hoax posts from social media is proposed. We propose a system framework that might be able to filter out hoax from social media post feeds in order to reduce the amount of hoax posts in social media. It is difficult to reduce 100% hoax from social media, but at least there is a technology which can decrease the hoax in social media. This system works by utilizing data mining to search past hoax records and analyze the post data pattern to determine whether a post is a hoax or not hoax. Our proposed system will also utilize social media Application Program Interface (API) such as news, facebook, twitter, in order to find similar writing in other social media or news website to find out the authenticity of a person's post. © 2017 IEEE.","Application Program Interface; Data Mining; Hoax; Hoax Detection; Social Media","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Filtration; Search engines; Application program interfaces; Data patterns; Facebook; Hoax; News websites; Social media; System framework; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Mayfield, A., (2017) What Is Social Media, , www.icrossing.com/uk/default/filesuk/insightpdffiles/What%20is%20Social%20MediaiCrossingebook.pdf, Access on 8 June; Perrin, A., (2000) Social Media Usage, , 2015"", Numbers, Facts and Trends shaping the world, Pew Research Center, October 2015; Wijaya, A., Girsang, A., The use of data mining for prediction of customer loyalty (2016) CommIT Journal, 10 (1), pp. 41-47; Lewis, D., Jones, K., Natural language processing for information retrieval (1996) Communications of the ACM, 39 (1), pp. 92-101. , July; Allcott, H., Gentzkow, M., Social media and fake news in the 2016 election (2017) Journal of Economic Perspective, 31, pp. 211-236; Tritama, H.B., Tarigan, R.E., The effect of social media to the brand awareness of a product of a company (2016) CommIT Journal, 10 (1), pp. 9-14; Situngkir, H., Spread of Hoax in Social Media, , https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/30674, Access on: 8 June 2017; Sag, I., Baldwin, T., Bond, F., Copestake, A., Flickinger, D., (2017) Multiword Expressions: A Pain in the Neck for Nlp, , http://hdl.handle.net/10220/6828, Access On: 8 June; Inibaru, Lebih Dari 90% Penyebaran Berita Hoax Lewat Medsos, , http://inibaru.id/post/lebih-dari-90-penyebaran-berita-hoaxlewat-medsos/on, Access 8 June 2017; Arun, K., Nayagam, M.G., Building applications with social networking api's (2014) Int.

Unlike the cat swam optimization that operates one cat, this algorithm uses some cats as population bases to converge the result. ACPSO employs an adaptive method by choosing a seeking mode or tracing mode based on a mixture ratio (MR). In the tracing mode, this algorithm uses a modified particle swarm optimization to increase diversity solutions. To demonstrate the performance, ACPSO was conducted to solve some datasets clustering problem. The results show that ACPSO has a good performance compared to the other methods. © 2016 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Cat swarm optimization; Clustering; CSO; Data clustering; PSO",,,,,,"Kumar, Y., Sahoo, G., An Improved Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm Based on Opposition-Based Learning and Cauchy Operator for Clustering (2015) Journal of Information Processing Systems; Zinjore, R.S., Kolhe, S.R., Data Clustering Using Supervised and Unsupervised Learning (2008) National Conference on “Computing Communication and Electronica”, , Organized by KCE’s College of Engineering and I.T.

This application is able to describe the transition diagram of DFA and NFA. It is able to determine which string inputted from the user can be accepted or rejected. The main goal is to help facilitate language learning automata theory. This research describes the system development of the application program, from the creating of automata structures to the implementation of algorithm in the creation and running of automata transformation. The test is conducted by observing the system in dealing with the formation and transformation of finite automata. It is conducted to examine the system's ability to run automata in large state. From the test we obtain that the system is capable of creating automata and performing transformations between finite automata. The results of performance testing show that the system is able to run the creation and transformation of finite state automata up to 1000 states. © 2013 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.","DFA; Eclipse; Finite state automata; NFA",,,,,,"Anderson, P., (2008) Implementation of Algorithms for State Minimisation and Conversion of Regular Expressions to and from Finite Automata, , http://regex-automaton.com, Birkbeck College, University of London; Bhargava, S., Purohit, G.N., Construction of a minimal deterministic finite automaton from a regular expression (2011) Inter.

But if the user goes into the room or building, then the human tracking application cannot get the user's position as the GPS signal cannot get through the wall. By using RFID, human tracking application can perform tracking in a certain closed area by providing room's or building's information that is entered. The IP camera as part of the system will send the images as visualization inside the room. In this research, human tracking system is built on a specific area that has lots of room or building such as a theme park or sports club.

In this paper, the research was continued by combining radio-frequency identification (RFID) and GPS in order to get better human tracking in both indoor and outdoor area. For indoor tracking, an RFID tag was carried by a user and continually read whenever he/she accessed a room while GPS was used mainly when the user was staying outdoor. GPS would be automatically activated whenever the user leaved the room 3 meters away. The accuracy of this tracking was 100% and the GPS could allocate the user every 3.27 meters. Thus this application is suitable to track the human position for both indoor and outdoor. © 2016 IEEE.","ADB; GPS; human tracking; raspberry pi; RFID","Radio frequency identification (RFID); Human Tracking; Indoor tracking; RF-ID tags; Global positioning system",,,,,"Gerdisen, Y., Solid, V., Wahyudi, O., Hutabarat, D.P., Hedwig, R., Human tracking in a certain closed area based on global positioning system (GPS) (2014) Internetworking Indonesia Journal, 6 (1 B), pp. 3-6; Zhang, D., Xia, F., Yang, Z., Yao, L., Zhao, W., Localization technologies for indoor human tracking (2010) 5th International Conference on Future Information Technology, pp. 1-6. , Busan; Tesoriero, R., Tebar, R., Gallud, J.A., Lozano, M.D., Penichet, V.M.R., Improving location awareness in indoor spaces using RFID technology (2010) Expert Systems with Applications, 37 (1), pp. 894-898. , January; Guillemette, M.G., Fontaine, I., Caron, C., Hybrid RFID-GPS real-time location system for human resources: Development, impacts and perspectives (2008) 41st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, p. 406. , Waikoloa; Pejic, A., Pletl, S., Pejic, B., An expert system for tourists using google maps API (2009) 7th International Symposium on Intelligent Systems and Informatics, Subotica, pp. 317-322; Höflinger, F., Zhang, R., Hoppe, J., Bannoura, A., Reindl, L.M., Wendeberg, J., Bührer, M., Schindelhauer, C., Acoustic self-calibrating system for indoor smartphone tracking (ASSIST) (2012) International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN), Sydney, pp. 1-9; Richardson, M., Wallace, S., (2013) Getting Started with Raspberry Pi, , First Edition ed., B.

In that situation user must have system with advance technology so person do not worry when getting away from his home. It is therefore the purpose of this design to provide home security device, which send fast information to user GSM (Global System for Mobile) mobile device using SMS (Short Messaging System) and also activate - deactivate system by SMS. The Modular design of this Home Security System make expandable their capability by add more sensors on that system. Hardware of this system has been designed using microcontroller AT Mega 328, PIR (Passive Infra Red) motion sensor as the primary sensor for motion detection, camera for capturing images, GSM module for sending and receiving SMS and buzzer for alarm. For software this system using Arduino IDE for Arduino and Putty for testing connection programming in GSM module. This Home Security System can monitor home area that surrounding by PIR sensor and sending SMS, save images capture by camera, and make people panic by turn on the buzzer when trespassing surrounding area that detected by PIR sensor. The Modular Home Security System has been tested and succeed detect human movement. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,"Azid, S.I., Kumar, S., Analysis and performance of a low cost SMS based home security system (2011) International Journal of Smart Home, 5 (3); Khan, S.R., Al Mansur, A., Kabir, A., Jaman, S., Chowdhury, N., Design and implementation of low cost home security system using GSm network (2012) International Journal of Scientific and Engineering Research, 3 (3); Valouch, J., Integration of alarm systems (2012) International Journal of Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity, 3; Azid, S.I., Sharma, B., Intelligent home: SMS based home security system with immediate feedback (2012) World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, 72; Mahendran, N., Joe Mathai, G., Veenesh, M.U., Multiple sensor feeding supported building automation system using arduino platform with exposure of 802.15.4 functionalities (2013) International Journal of Engineering Trends and Technology, 4 (2); http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno, Arduino Uno website; http://www.simcom.eu/index.php?m=letoltes, Simcom GSM modem website; http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/File:Twig_-_BISS0001.pdf, Seedstudio PIR sensor website; http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/Digital_Buzzer_Module_(SKU :_DFR0032), DFRobot Buzzer Alarm website; http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/Real_Time_Clock_Module_(DS1307 )_(SKU:DFR0151), DFRobot Realtime clock website; http://seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Serial_Camera, Twig Serial Camera website; http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/ MicroSD_card_module_for_Arduino_%28SKU:DFR0229%29, MicroSD Adapter for Arduino website",,,"","EDP Sciences","2013 International Conference on Advances Science and Contemporary Engineering, ICASCE 2013","23 October 2013 through 24 October 2013","Jakarta",,21016275,,,,"English","EPJ Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901468914

Analysis of future research topics by using a numerical approach based on scientific publications or patents have been previously done by several researchers mostly by classifying the topics based on the similarity of the documents. Meanwhile, time series analysis using statistical techniques, machine learning and logistic curves has also been conducted but for areas other than research topics. In this study, we will perform time series analysis to predict the topic of research by employing combination of machine learning approaches such as Neural Network, Extreme Learning Machine and Support Vector Machine. The prediction result is then finally refined by logistic curve. The dataset used in this study is a research report on Bioinformatics from Microsoft Research and NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information), over the past 30 years. Experimental result indicates that the combination of machine learning approaches and logistic-curve may improve the prediction accuracy. In addition, the emerging topic of the same dataset can be predicted with a relatively high average precision. Based on the dataset used, some emerging topics predicted for the next three years are 'Sequence Alignment', 'Index Terms', 'Secondary Structure', 'Nucleic Acid', and 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae'. © 2005 - 2013 JATIT & LLS.

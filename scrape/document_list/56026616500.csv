However, to be able to apply the concept, there are three main elements that must be prepared as the basic foundation. These elements are structure, infrastructure, and superstructure. In this study we focused on the problem of the high cost of funding needed to finance these three elements. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the government must create new investment opportunities outside the stock exchange whose impacts can also be directly used for financing programs. In this study, we conducted an investigation of the interest of urban people to invest in online channels. The aim is to determine the decision-making behavior of the Indonesian people in non-consumptive capital expenditure activities when the government creates and publishes financing instruments on the market. The hope is to be able to create a national development financing strategy that is in accordance with the characteristics of the Indonesian people and right on target. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

The increasing amount of production will also affect the increasing demand for freight forwarding services. The faster a product reaches the end consumer, the faster the economical turnover of a country will occur. However, reality does not always happen like that, especially in Indonesia. The high cost of transportation often weighs on end consumers to buy products. So that there is a decrease in purchasing power from consumers due to the cost of production, which is too expensive. The problem of logistics is one of the crucial things that must always be a concern for all of us. In this study, a web-based freight forwarding application was built to facilitate the integration process between several freight forwarding operators to service the demand for goods distribution from producers to end consumers. The goal is, of course, to accelerate the process of distribution of goods, tidy up the administrative process, and increase the savings in the cost of shipping goods, because the sourcing of resources is integrated and well allocated. So that the difficulty of waiting time can be shortened and used for more useful activities. © 2019 IEEE.","logistics information systems; logistics management; small medium sized companies; software development life cycle; web-based shipping application.","Application programs; Information management; Life cycle; Ships; Software design; Websites; Logistics information systems; Logistics management; Medium-sized companies; Shipping applications; Software development life cycle; Distribution of goods",,,,,"Lie, Y., Atmojo, R.N.P., Muljo, H.H., The effectiveness of o2o strategy on e-commerce transactions (2019) The Winners, 20 (1), pp. 9-17; Atmojo, R.N.P., Rekening bersama (rekber) the Indonesian escrow service of money (2016) Int.

The research was conducted using a quantitative research approach to obtain data from 247 respondents who actively use the music as a service application.

Usually, consumer will do a strategy to coping the confusion, that strategy is known as Confusion Reduction Strategy. The conventional ways usually taken by the consumer to reduce the confusion are, such as: Asking for product recommendation to close relatives, seeking for an additional product information on the internet and so on. However, suggestions and recommendations from conventional sources obtained by the consumer, sometimes are not always accurate (not objective) and time consuming (inefficient). Therefore, this research proposes a Decision Support System (DSS) application to cope with the confusion. In this study, the comparison results between conventional methods (such as: Asking advice to close relatives or seeking for an additional information on the internet) with the proposed method (the DSS) were presented. In addition, another implication of this study is to get the factors that causing consumer confusion in case of smartphone purchases. This research used mixed-method approach, implemented through interview and survey. Research samples were 136 potential smartphone buyers which are converted to 27 smartphone buyers; brand image is the main source of consumer confusion (mean 3.98, std. dev 0.86), followed by proliferation of brands, services and models of smartphone products (mean 3.89, std. dev 0.82). Respondents often use Word of Mouth (WoM) communication as main source of information to reduce the confusion, results of 16 from 27 transactions were contributed from WoM. DSS application contributed only 2 of 27 smartphone transactions. Further research for the development of mobile based DSS application as an alternative conventional CRS needs to be conducted, because of the potential success of static desktop based DSS application in reducing potential consumer confusion especially for value oriented buyers. © 2014 Science Publication.","Confusion Reduction Strategy; Consumer Confusion; Decision Support System; Fuzzy Logic; Simple Additive Weighting",,,,,,"Afshari, A., Mojahed, M., Yusuff, R.M., Simple additive weighting approach to personnel selection problem (2010) Int.

In this situation the phenomenon of ""buying a pig in a poke"" is very possible to occur. Moreover, the customer feels disapointed when the book she/he purchases is unavailable. The classical reason usually given is the book stock is not available anymore, because it is discontinued from its supplier. Nevertheless, at the time on the display window the book stock may be ""in stock"" and the customer is enabled to do the ordering and payment process.

Where, the Tablet PCs was a product that transforming from the minimization of notebook computer. In other words, it can be said as a handheld device that has an 'almost' similar performance as a notebook computer but has a more compact and smaller size dimension than the notebook computers and has a bigger dimension than the smart-phones also. The problem is there were so many variations of Tablet PCs products on the market. Therefore, the question often arises about the Tablet PCs is, ""which one the most-suitable product for my purposes""? In this study modeled a simulation process for Tablet PCs selection using the eight domains of weighting criteria. Which from our perspective these eight domains of weighting criteria are an 'objective' measurement for assessing the Tablet PCs products.

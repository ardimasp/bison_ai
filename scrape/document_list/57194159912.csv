But if the user goes into the room or building, then the human tracking application cannot get the user's position as the GPS signal cannot get through the wall. By using RFID, human tracking application can perform tracking in a certain closed area by providing room's or building's information that is entered. The IP camera as part of the system will send the images as visualization inside the room. In this research, human tracking system is built on a specific area that has lots of room or building such as a theme park or sports club. System is designed using an RFID reader, RFID tags, IP Camera, the database server and Android smartphones. The research was done inside Syahdan Campus, Bina Nusantara University - Jakarta. The result shows that the application is working with 100% tapping and mapping accuracy. © 2016 IEEE.","Android; closed area; IP Camera; RFID; smart phone","Android (operating system); Cameras; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Smartphones; Android; closed area; Data-base servers; Human tracking systems; IP camera; Mapping accuracy; Specific areas; Through the wall; Global positioning system",,,,,"Miskelly, F., Electronic tracking of patients with dementia and wandering using mobile phone technology (2005) Age and Ageing, 34 (5), pp. 497-518; Raymond, J.N., Thomas, G.B., Caracciolo, A., James, R.S., Jr., (1991) Tracking System, , Software US 5014206 A, May 7; Elgethun, K., Yost, M.G., Fitzpatrick, C.T.E., Nyerges, T.L., Fenske, R.A., Comparison of Global Positioning System (GPS) Tracking and Parent-report diaries to characterize children's time-location patterns (2006) Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology, 17, pp. 196-206. , June; Spek Der Van, S., Van Schaick, J., De Bois, P., De Haan, R., Sensing human activity: GPS tracking (2009) Sensors, 9 (4), pp. 3033-3055. , April; Zhang, D., Xia, F., Yang, Z., Yao, L., Zhao, W., Localization techonolgy for indoor human tracking (2010) 5th International Conference on Future Information Technology (Future Tech), pp. 1-6. , Busan; Werb, J., Lanzl, C., Designing a positioning system for finding things and people indoors (1998) IEEE Spectrum, 35 (9), pp. 71-78. , September; Gu, Y., Lo, A., Niemegeers, I., A survey of indoor positioning systems for wireless personal networks (2009) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 11 (1), pp. 13-32. , March; Ran, L., Helal, S., Moore, S., Drishti: An integrated indoor/Outdoor blind navigation system and service (2004) The Second IEEE Annual Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications, pp. 23-30; Zaruba, G.V., Huber, M., Kamangar, F.A., Chlamtac, I., Indoor location tracking using RSSI readings from a single Wi-Fi access point (2007) Journal Wireless Networks, 13 (2), pp. 221-235. , April; Renaudin, V., Yalak, O., Tomé, P., Merminod, B., Indoor navigation of emergency agents (2007) European Journal of Navigation, 5 (3), pp. 1-10. , July; Jin, G.-Y., Lu, X.-Y., Park, M.-S., An indoor localization mechanism using active RFID tag (2006) IEEE International Conference on Sensor Networks, Ubiquitous, and Trustworthy Computing, Taichung; Tsuboi, T., Shiraishi, T., Komuro, N., Indoor human positioning tracking technique to support high-quality life (2009) International Joint Conference, Japan, pp. 5745-5749; Gupta, A.K., Katiyar, S., Kumar, N., Railway track finding system with RFID application (2013) International Journal of Computer Aplication, 836 (7), pp. 24-30. , December; Gerdisen, Y., Solid, V., Wahyudi, O., Hutabarat, D.P., Hedwig, R., Human tracking in a certain closed area based on global positioning system (GPS) (2014) Internetworking Indonesia Journal, 6 (1 B), pp. 3-6",,"Widianto E.D.Arfan M.Riyadi M.A.Facta M.","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd International Conference on Information Technology, Computer, and Electrical Engineering, ICITACEE 2016","19 October 2016 through 21 October 2016",,127215,,9781509014347,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

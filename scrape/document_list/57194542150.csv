Every banking company in Indonesia is obliged to report monthly reports to Bank Indonesia for financial supervision, but on the use of reporting systems is perceived to be less than optimal. The IS audit control mechanism using this COBIT framework not only provides an evaluation of IT governance in the company, but also provides inputs that can be used to improve its management. COBIT 5 is therefore a benchmark for the process of appraising and improving IT governance. After the mapping obtained 7 processes for the measurement that is EDM02, APO02, APO11, BAI06, DSS01, DSS02, and DSS03. Result of each process, obtained the level of capability of each process EDM02 = Level 1, APO02 = Level 2, APO11 = Level 2, BAI06 = Level 2, DSS01 = Level 2, DSS02 = Level 2, and DSS03 = Level 1. The IT governance gap analysis is done by comparing the current level of IT governance capability with the target level to be achieved. © 2019 IEEE.","Banking Company; Business Goals; COBIT 5; IT Governance","Sustainable development; Business goals; Business performance; COBIT 5; Current levels; Effectiveness and efficiencies; IT governance; Reporting systems; Target levels; Information use",,,,,,"Bourgeois, D.T., Information Systems for Business and Beyond:.Published Through the Open Text Book Challenge by the Saylor Academy, , February 2014; Bermejo, P.H.S., Tonelli, A.O., Evaluating it governance practices and business and it outcomes : A quantitative exploratory study in brazilian companies (2014) Procedia Technology, 16, pp. 849-857; Karkoskova, S., Feuerlicht, G., Extending mbi model using itil and cobit processes (2015) Journal of Systems Integration, 5, pp. 29-44. , http://www.si-Journal.org/index.php/JSI/article/view/244; Cornford, T., Shaikh, M., (2013) Introduction to Information Systems Economics, Management, , University of London, International Programmes; Laudon, K.C., Laudon, J.P., Management Information Systems Managing the Digital Firm, Thirteenth Edition, , Pearson Education Limited 2014; Kuruzovich, J., (2012) IT Governance Processes and IT Alignment : Viewpoints from the Board of Directors, pp. 5043-5052; Bowen, P.L., Cheung, M.D., Rohde, F.H., (2007) Enhancing IT Governance Practices: A Model and Case Study of An Organizations Efforts, 8, pp. 191-221; Spremić, M., IT Governance Mechanisms in Managing IT Business 2009Value, 6 (6), pp. 906-915; ITGI, .""COBIT 4.1 Excerpt Executive Summary Framework"" Leading the IT Governance Community, USA. 2007; Khther, R.A., Othman, M., Cobit framework as a guideline of effective it governance in higher education : A review (2013) International Journal of Information Technology Convergence and Services, 3 (1), pp. 21-29. , http://doi.org/10.5121/ijitcs.2013.3102; (2012), ISACA, .

Transfering data from the sensor via the internet network to a monitoring device must be less than 300 ms. One process that can cause non-fulfillment of these requirements is a method for displaying the data on a monitor. There are several methods for delivering data from the sensor to a monitor. This paper has been compared between two methods, namely the polling method and the websocket method. The experiment was conducted to compare these two method. The result obtained that the websocket method was better in presenting real time data compared to the polling method. It can be shown in bandwidth usage and memory usage. In the experiment was found that the average of bandwidth usage is 478KB for polling method, and 91KB for web socket method in web based and the memory consumption of websocket less as much as 16% compared to polling method. In android smartphone the average bandwidth usage is 5.1 KB for web socket method and 15 KB for polling method and the memory consumption of websocket less as much as 22% compared to polling method. © 2019 The Authors.

The user can move their hands as interaction control, replacing old navigation. Data is collected by distributing questionnaire and game score to participants. Analysis data uses index learning styles and pearson correlation. It concluded that using motion gesture game for measure method learning style can help to measure a kinesthetic player.

The difference between this research application and others is the search feature based on an image. The search feature is designed to match the shape and orientation. This application uses a Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm to conduct the matching feature process. The SURF algorithm is divided into three main steps. The first step is to retrieve the image information and turn it into a matrix, using a Hessian - Laplace Technique to define the feature point following the integral to reduce the computational time. It also uses a Difference of Gaussian in order to handle the object with an invariant scale. This process is called Fast Hessian. The second step is to define the orientation of the image using a Haar Wavelet Responses Technique. The third step is to match the feature points from both images using a four dimensional vector and K-Means as a classification technique. The result of this research is an application which is able to collect plant information using image matching. © 2016 IEEE.","CBIR; encyclopedia; image matching; SURF","Information management; Web services; CBIR; Classification technique; Dimensional vectors; encyclopedia; Research applications; Speeded up robust features; SURF; Web-based applications; Image matching",,,,,,"Connolly, T., Begg, C., Database systems: A practical approach to design, implementation, and management (6th edition) (2014) Pearson; Giri, A., Meena, Y.K., Review paper on content based image retrieval (2014) The International Journal of Science and Technoledge, pp. 125-129; Blanken, H., Vries, A., Blok, H., Feng, L., (2010) Multimedia Retrieval, , Amsterdam: Springer; Arthiabd, K., Vijayaraghavan, J., Content based image retrieval algorithm using colour models (2013) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 2 (3), pp. 1343-1347; Santos, L.F., Dias, R., Ribeiro, M., Traina, A., Combining diversity queries and visual mining to improve (2015) IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia, pp. 357-362; Meena, M., Ram Singh, A., Bharadi, A., Architecture for software as a service (saas) model of cbir on hybrid cloud of microsoft azure (2016) 7th International Conference on Communication, Computing and Virtualization 2016, pp. 569-578; Krajník, T., Cristóforis, P., Nitsche, M., Kusum, K., Image features and seasons revisited (2015) Mobile Robots (ECMR),2015 European Conference, pp. 1-7; Saad, M.H., Saleh, H., Konber, H., Ashour, M., CBIR system based on integration between surf and global features (2013) ICIT 2013 the 6th International Conference on Information Technology; Bay, H., Tuytelaars, T., Gool, L.C., SURF: Speeded up robust features (2008) Computer Vision and Image Understanding (CVIU), 110 (3), pp. 346-359; Guo, F., Luo, X., Liu, Y., Research on feature extraction and match method based on the surf algorithm for mobile augmented reality system (2015) International Industrial Informatics and Computer Engineering Conference, pp. 615-619; Schmitt, D., McCoy, N., (2011) Object Classification and Localization Using SURF Descriptors, , Citeseer; Lu, G., (1999) Multimedia Database Management Systems, , Norwood: Artech House",,,"BINUS Univerity;IEEE Indonesia Section;Wiley","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2016","16 November 2016 through 18 November 2016",,127842,,9781509033522,,,"English","Proc.

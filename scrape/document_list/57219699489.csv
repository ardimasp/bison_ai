Indonesia's game development community is still budding and has more room to expand in continuing years. With Indonesia's rich culture it's a wonder how there are not many popular games that revolve around it, especially one that includes its unique cuisine. Subsequently, cooking games too have slowed down within the market where current games are not able to satisfy consumers therefore none are playing games from the genre. The authors decided to develop a game that utilizes both the cooking game genre and Indonesia's cuisine to appeal to the Android market. This is done through a survey for market research and player testing to accomplish a game worthy of the expectations of the current market. © 2019 IEEE.","Android Mobile Game; Cooking Game; Game Development; Game Mechanics; Mobile Application; Simulation","Android (operating system); Commerce; Software design; Android markets; Game design; Game development; Indonesia; Market researches; Video game; Human computer interaction",,,,,"Definition of GAME, , http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/game, Merriam-webster; McDonald, E., (2018) The Global Games Market 2017 | per Region & Segment Newzoo, , http://newzoo.com/insights/articles/the-global-games-market-willreach-108-9-billion-in-2017-with-mobile-taking-42/, Newzoo; (2017) China Topic Report: Mobile Games-Research and Markets Researchandmarkets, , http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/n95h5w/2017chinatopic, R. ltd, 2018; (2018) Newzoo, , http://newzoo.com/insights/infographics/the-indonesiangamer-2017/, The Indonesian Gamer 2017 Newzoo; (2018) Mobile Games-Indonesia Statista Market Forecast Statista, , http://www.statista.com/outlook/211/120/mobilegames/indonesia#market-revenue, [Accessed: 29-Mar-2018]; (2018) IGN: Cooking Mama Surpasses 500, 000, , http://web.archive.org/web/20090310001702/http://games.ign.com/articles/816/816299p1.html, Web.archive.org; (2018) Oxford Dictionaries English, , http://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cooking, Cooking: Definition of cooking in English by Oxford Dictionaries; Thomson, J., The very real psychological benefits of cooking for other people (2017) HuffPost UK, , http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/benefits-of-cooking-forothersus5967858ae4b0a0c6f1e67a15; Schell, J., (2015) The Art of Game Design, , Boca Raton CRC Press; Widjaja, J., (2018) Game Thesis Market Research Google Docs, , http://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pJcyVr9x5aLhPR13xmEpNnHS; Cook, Serve, Delicious!

This research uses Rajan Baral's Technology Acceptance Model approach. As for the object of research is public oil and gas company in Indonesia (XYZ). The respondents in this study were employees of XYZ marketing operation division in Jakarta, West Java, and Banten area who intensively used mySAP system Sales and Distribution Module. The sampling technique used was random sampling with a limit of 34 people. Primary data obtained through interviews and questionnaires. Method of data analysis used was Partial Least Square Method with the help of software SmartPLS. The results showed that the factors that succeeded in explaining the related acceptance and use of mySAP system Sales and Distribution Module at XYZ company were complexity, compatibility, training, and perceived ease of use factors, which indirectly affected intention to use, usage, panoptic empowerment and individual performance. © 2019 IEEE.","distribution; PLS; sales; SAP; TAM","Gas industry; Information management; Least squares approximations; Public utilities; Surveys; distribution; Individual performance; Marketing operations; Oil and gas companies; Partial least square methods; Perceived ease of use; Sales and distribution; Technology acceptance model; Sales",,,,,"Wu, S.P.-J., Straub, D.W., Liang, T.-P., How information technology governance mechanisms and strategic alignment influence organizational performance: Insights from a matched survey of business and it managers (2015) MIS Q., 39 (2), pp. 497-518. , Feb; Kaur, B.P., Aggrawal, H., Exploration of success factors of information system (2013) IJCSI Int.

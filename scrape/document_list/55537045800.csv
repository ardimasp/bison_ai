XYZ is a telecommunications company which relatively new and aware of the increasing competitive competition in the telecommunications industry. PT. XYZ was starting its operation in 2006. The company's ambition is to develop progressively by increasing operational performance which closely linkages between operational performance improvements company with a bottom line of the company. Thus, it is a necessity/obligation for companies in the global era of integrated telecommunications services, to focus on Quality of services (QoS) provided to its customers, in order to survive in an increasingly competitive telecommunications business.

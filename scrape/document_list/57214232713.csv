Based on the problem, identifying the face of the query in low resolution, based on high resolution (64x64) proves to be a huge challenge. The aim of this research is to develop a new model for face recognition of low-resolution image in order to increase the accuracy of recognition. A Multi-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (MRCNN) is proposed to address the problem. First, Antialiasing is used in preprocessing phase, then use MRCNN to extract the feature of the image. LWF (Labeled Face in Wild) will be used to evaluate the model. The result of this study is increasing the accuracy of face recognition on low-resolution image compared to the previous MRCNN model. © Science and Information Organization.","Antialiasing; Convolutional neural network; Face recognition; Low resolution",,,,,,"ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by Research Grant No. 225/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019 from Ministry of Research Technology and Higher Education of Republic of Indonesia.","Dandpat, S.K., Meher, S., ""Performance improvement for face recognition using PCA and two-dimensional PCA"" (2013) in International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics; Kan, M., Shan, S., Zhang, H., Lao, S., Chen, X., ""Multi-view discriminant analysis"" (2015) IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence, 38, pp. 188-194; Abiantun, R., Juefei-Xu, F., Prabhu, U., Savvides, M., ""SSR2: Sparse Signal Recovery for Single-Image Super-Resolution on Faces with Extreme Low Resolutions.""

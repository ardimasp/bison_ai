Palmerah, Jakarta, 11480, Indonesia","Indonesian traditional textile has distinct signature textile culture on its natural dye, for example Classical Batik of Yogyakarta which is well known for its brown soga colour, a brownish colour obtained from the colourants combination of jambal bark (Pelthophorum ferrugineum), tingi bark (Ceriops candolleana), and tegeran wood (Cudrania javanensis). Along with those ingredients, Classical Batik of Yogyakarta also uses indigo plant (Indigofera tinctoria) as its blue colourant to help create darker brown colour, and kapur tohor (Calcium Oxide) for pre and post mordant treatment. The colour study output would be a recommendation as it would be a non-analog inventory documentation of Classical Batik of Yogyakarta natural dye. In order to make the colour visual data suitable for digital device, the research requires fabrics dyed with Classical Batik of Yogyakarta natural dye ingredients and technique as samples for colour identification study by spectrophotometry and by digitalization method to obtain RGB colour value. The natural dye colour digital format data is designed to facilitate data preservation and its acquisition by individuals whom have interest on textile natural dye. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Kartika, S.

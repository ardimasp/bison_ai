This research is a preliminary study for research that aims to prove the relationship between the use of language and organisational culture in a company. The method used was qualitative research by an in-depth interview with participating employees who work in Japan's creative industry. The object of this research focusses on the use of term of address by staff to superiors. The results show that the 2 (two) companies which are creative industries used ""family name+san"" to address superiors, and used ""family name+professional ranking"" to address the highest superior in the company. This research found that using ""family name+san"" to the superiors brought the relationship between the superiors and subordinates closer. This condition causes the communication to be smoother and the atmosphere to become more relaxed. © 2020 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Creative industry; Form of address; Open system; Organisational culture; Results oriented",,,,,,"Annamalah, S., Raman, M., Marthandan, G., Logeswaran, A.K., Acceptance of Open Innovation Model in Malaysian SMIs (2016) International Journal of Innovation Creativityn and Change, 2 (4), pp. 68-84; Braun, F., (1986) Terms of Address: Problems of Patterns and Usage in Various Languages and Cultures, , De Gruyter; Brown, P., Levinson, S., Politeness: Some Universals in Language Use (1987) Studies in Interactional Sociolinguistics, 4, pp. 55-84; Creswell, J.W., Clark, P.V.L., Creswell, J.W.J.W., Plano Clark, V.L.V.L., Clark, V.L.P.P., Plano Clark, V.L.V.L., Designing and Conducting Mixed Methods Research (2007) Saga; Daft, R.L., Organisation Theory and Design (2010) South Western Cengage Learning; Hanzawa, S., The Japanese animation and home video game industries: Locational patterns, labor markets, and inter-firm relationships (2004) Japanese Journal of Human Geography, 56 (6), pp. 29-44; Hofstede, Cultures and Organisations (2010) Cultures and Organisations; Ide, S., Japanese sociolinguistics politeness and women's language (1982) Lingua, 57 (2-4), pp. 357-385; Ide, S., Yoshida, M., Sociolinguistics: Honorifics and Gender Differences (1999) The Handbook of Japanese Linguistics; Jones, G.R., (2013) Gareth R.

What is meant by Keigo is the polite way of delivering language, or polite language, while an honorific, in general, is communication language system that shows politeness, respect and low-profile. The writer limited this research on the discussion about the phenomenon of the use of Yakushokumeishoo and Keigo as a part of honorifics structure that is seen with the concept of power distance in the communication applied in some Japanese companies, used by the employees of Japanese companies in Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. From the questionnaire, the result showed that the greeting form used by the employees toward their superior is in the form of structural greeting, family name+san. This result showed that there have been changes on the use of greeting form toward superior in Japan, from the use of structural greeting to the common greeting, “-san.” This greeting form does not affect to the emotional distance from the employees toward the superior. Japanese employees can express their opinion and disagreement to their superior by using the common greeting form. On the other hand, there is also a respondent that used common greeting form which is family name+san but they are not able to express their opinion and disagreement to their superior. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Honorific title; Japanese; Power distance; Wakayama",,,,,,"Yasuda, S., (1998) Bijinesu Keigo Katsuyou Jiten, , Gyousei, Japan; Aoki, T., Matsumoto, K., Miyazaki, M., (2003) Tadashii Keigo No Tsukaikata, Nihon Nouritsukyoukai Manajemento Senta, , Japan; Hofstede, G., Hofstede, G.J., Minkov, M., (2010) Cultures and Organization, , McGraw Hill, United States; Hofstede, G., (1993) Academy of Management Journal, p. 81; Tuleja, E.S., (2005) Intercultural Communication for Business, South Western Cengage Learning, USA; Cresswell, J.W., (1994) Research Design Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches, , Sage Publications, USA","Marion, E.C.; Faculty of Humanities, Kemanggisan Ilir III No. 45 Palmerah, Indonesia",,,"American Scientific Publishers",,,,,19366612,,,,"English","Adv.

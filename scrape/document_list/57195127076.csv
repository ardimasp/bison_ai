EFEAS is developed using a microcontroller, android application and solar panel devices. Microcontroller is used to develop a main device of EFEAS that functions to activate siren, send SMS, switch electrical power from solar panels to conventional source or vice versa, and communicate with an android smartphone. Android application is developed and used to connect the android smartphone to the system. This system will activate sirene, send alerts and the location of the house when the panic button pushed by the user. With the implementation of this system residents are expected to be able to get faster handling when there are hazardous conditions in the house. This system developed can achieve the objective of being able to be operated using an Android smartphone to control all components within the system with 100% successful rate to send SMS within 13 seconds and 100% successful rate to switch between solar panel and adaptor. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Android Application; Arduino Uno; ESP8266; Home security system; Panic button","Controllers; Environmental protection; Fasteners; Microcontrollers; Security systems; Signaling; Smartphones; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Android applications; Arduino Uno; ESP8266; Home security systems; Panic button; Android (operating system)",,,,,"(2018) Statistik Kriminal 2018, , https://www.bps.go.id/publication/2018/12/26/89c06f465f944f3be39006a1/statistik-kriminal-2018.html, Badan Pusat Statistik; Wijaya, L.D., (2019) Punya Senjata Api, Polisi: Pencuri Tak Ragu Tembak Penghalangnya, , https://metro.tempo.co/read/1171816/punya-senjata-api-polisi-pencuri-tak-ragu-tembak-penghalangnya, Arjanto, D (Ed.); Viswanatha, V., Venkata Siva, R.R., Kp, A., Multilevel Home Scurity System using Arduino & GSM (2018) Journal for Research, 4, pp. 1-6; Thakur, S., Verma, M., Sahu, L., Security System using Arduino Microcontroller (2018) International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology, 5, pp. 3124-3127; Kumar, B.S., Ramesh, S., Burglar System using Arduino and PIR Sensor with SMS Alert (2017) International Journal of Current Engineering & Scientific Research, 4, pp. 16-22; Arf, S., Aridharsan, A., Android based Automation and Security System for Smart Homes (2017) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology Research, 5, pp. 26-30; Bolaji, A.Q., Kamaldeen, R.A., Samson, O.F., Abdullahi, A.T., Abubakar, S.K., A Digitalized Smart Home Automation and Security System via Bluetoot/Wi-Fi using Android Platform (2017) International Journal of Information and Communication Sciences, 2 (6), pp. 93-99; Chandramohan, J., Nagarajan, R., Sateeshkumar, K., Ajithkumar, N., Gopinath, P.A., Ranjithkumar, S., Intelligent Smart Home Automation and Security System Using Arduino and Wi-Fi (2015) International Journal of Engineering & Computer Science, 6, pp. 20694-20698; Seosa, O., Promise, E., GSM Based Intelligent Home Security for Intrusion Detection (2014) International Journal of Engineering and Technology, 4, pp. 595-605; Parab, A.S., Joglekar, A., Implementation of Home Security System using GSM Module and Microcontroller (2015) International Journal of Computer Science & Information Technologies, 6, pp. 2950-2953; Kodali, R.K., Jain, V., Bose, S., Boppana, L., IoT Based Smart Security and Home Automation System (2017) International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation System, pp. 1286-1289; Hutabarat, D.P., Budijono, S., Saleh, R., Development of home security system using ESP8266 and android smartphone as the monitoring tool (2018) IOP Conf.

However, the extraction of patchouli oil that has been done in Indonesia is generally still used conventional methods that require enormous amount of energy, high solvent usage, and long time of extraction. Therefore, in this study, patchouli oil extraction was carried out by using microwave hydrodistillation and solvent-free microwave extraction methods. Based on this research, it is known that the extraction of patchouli oil using microwave hydrodistillation method with longer extraction time (240 min) only produced patchouli oil's yield 1.2 times greater than solvent-free microwave extraction method which require faster extraction time (120 min). Otherwise the analysis of electric consumption and the environmental impact, the solvent-free microwave extraction method showed a smaller amount when compared with microwave hydrodistillation method. It is conclude that the use of solvent-free microwave extraction method for patchouli oil extraction is suitably method as a new green technique. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Environmental impact; Essential oils; Extraction; Microwaves; Plants (botany); Solvents; Conventional methods; Electric consumption; Extraction time; Green techniques; Hydrodistillations; Oil extraction; Pogostemon cablin benth; Solvent-free microwave extraction; Solvent extraction",,,,,"Molide, R., Meika, S.R., Ariato, M., (2010) Indonesian Essential Oil (In Bahasa Indonesia), , Dewan Atsiri Indonesia and IPB; Hu, X., (2014) Rev.

The factors considered were microwave power (A), feed to the solvent ratio (B) and extraction time (C). These parameters were varied at two levels. The conditions of optimum patchouli oil yield predicted were microwave power of 467.517 W, feed to solvent ratio of 0.432 g/mL and extraction time of 152.122 min. These factors gave an optimum patchouli oil yield of 4.862%. The significant model terms are extraction time. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates that the model was significant as evidenced from R2 of 0.9036 and the model F-value of 7.29. The patchouli oil yield predicted by the model was closed to the experimentally determined values (1.85 % and 1.87 % respectively); hence the model can be used for prediction of patchouli oil yield in essential oil extraction from dried patchouli leaves using microwave hydrodistillation method. © RASĀYAN.

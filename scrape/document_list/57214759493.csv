For instance a cloud server that make possible for a person or a company to have a server without have any real physical server. It can reduce cost and easy to maintain. In current parking system there are local server that serving a ticketing and billing, few of them are displaying the park lot status in a front gate for to notify the users. In this paper we provides a concept to make the information of park lot go directly onto users hand with smartphones assistance so decision time will be reduce. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

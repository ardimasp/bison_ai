It also provides a diagnostic feedback in case of electrical appliance's failure. It aims to lower the energy usage of the electrical appliances by cutting off the power completely during standby. Many kinds of approaches like literature studies, research and experiments were conducted to develop the prototype of the system. RaspberryPi, Arduino, relay board and CT current sensors are the hardware that used to control the use of electrical devices' energy and monitor how much it consume the energy. The application is mainly built using Laravel PHP framework and JavaScript with MySQL database. The result is a system prototype that capable to control, monitor and diagnose electrical appliances power, and lowering the total energy usage of the appliances by up to 59%. © 2015 The Authors.

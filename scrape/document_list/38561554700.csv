This research focuses on the time series data of some individual stocks from the Indonesian Stock Exchange as well as the index data. The financial forecasting agent implemented is based on a Multilayer Neural Network trained with the Genetic Algorithm. An incrementally trained Naïve Bayesian classifier to classify the news stories automatically is also implemented. The agent is measured for its performance on the specified historical stock price data. The first testing surveys its performance against the benchmark agents in a range of stocks. Although the agent does not consistently outperform the benchmarks, it does have its own advantages in terms of stability. The second test tries to find out whether news improves the agent's prediction accuracy. We find that in certain stocks and the index, the inclusion of news does improve the prediction accuracy. © 2011 IEEE.","financial forecasting; news classification; web agent","Bayesian classifier; Financial forecasting; news classification; Prediction accuracy; Stock exchange; Stock price; Time-series data; web agent; Finance; Knowledge based systems; Multilayer neural networks; Research; Time series; User interfaces; World Wide Web; Forecasting",,,,,"Mishkin, F.S., Eakins, S.G., (2006) Financial Markets and Institutions, , 5th ed.

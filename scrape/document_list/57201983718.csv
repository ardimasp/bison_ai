We analyzed over s even significant publishers with a total of 126 keywords to find the most suitable publisher s and the best keywords for our research. After determining the keyword and publisher, we analyzed 101 records of journal articles in Taylor and Francis publisher. We analyze all the aspects, including meta data for each record, topic of research, object of research, and we also added consideration of ICT aspect inclusion in each record. Our findings suggest th at: (1) there are more research in Africa and Europe comp ared to the rest of the world; (2) corruption prevention effort mentioning ICT has increased 4.5 times in the time period of 2016 2018 compared to 2013 2015; (3) there are more research focusing in practicability and less in basic research in the time peri od of 2016 2018 compared to 2013 2015.

In current modern society, information technology exists as a multidisciplinary tool to solve lingering problems that could not be solved by traditional efforts. This paper aims to provide knowledge regarding identified efforts to fight corruption specifically in Indonesia region. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology is used as the methodology, and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow is used as framework to identify relevant records. Scopus database is used as data source. A total of 10 records are labelled as relevant to this research, and the findings are synthesized. It was found from the records that the main areas of interest for ICT research for corruption prevention in Indonesia are (1) information transparency, (2) operational enhancement, (3) success evaluation, (4) security and fraud, and (4) decision support. The findings are expected to assist future research in term of providing valuable insights on corruption prevention using ICT in Indonesia. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In most university, management must be able to collect all hundreds of proposals and reports; not to mention they must be able to accommodate the process of reviewing every single proposal. They also need to monitor all research output in final report and make sure that all of the outputs are correctly achieved from proposed target. In addition to the problems stated, previous activities are done manually, leaving a lot of opportunity to improve and automate the process. All of the addressable opportunity for improvement are explained and explored, thus a model of the web application is created. This paper presents the design of web application used to solve persistent problem in research management, specifically in Binus University. The design methodology is divided into two phases: requirement engineering phase, and system design. Upon finishing the requirement engineering phase, system model is depicted using Unified Modeling Language, specifically: Activity Diagram, Use Case Diagram, and Conceptual Class Diagram. © 2018 IEEE.","higher education; research management system; unified modeling language","Information management; Systems analysis; Telecommunication services; Unified Modeling Language; Design Methodology; Design of web applications; Higher education; Requirement engineering; Research activities; Research management; Research management systems; Research outputs; Design",,,,,,"Braddock, R., Neave, G., Research management in higher education: Overview and conclusion of a debate (2002) Higher Education Policy, 15 (3), pp. 313-330; Shon, H.S., Han, S.H., Kim, K.A., Cha, E.J., Ryu, K.H., Proposal reviewer recommendation system based on big data for a national research management institute (2017) Journal of Information Science, 43 (2), pp. 147-158; Lu, R., (2016) University Teaching and Research and Scientific Research Performance Quantitative Statistics System; Morgan, A., Duffield, N., Walkley Hall, L., Research data management support: Sharing our experiences (2017) Journal of the Australian Library and Information Association, 66 (3), pp. 299-305; Liu, Y., Yao, Y., Zhang, X., Liu, B., Ding, C., Design of research management system based on workflow and rapid development platform technology (2015) Estimation, Detection and Information Fusion (ICEDIF), 2015 International Conference on, pp. 329-334. , IEEE, January; Morales, M.P.E., Abulon, E.L.R., Ermita, R.C., David, A.P., Organizing and systematizing knowledge management through an automated university-based research Portal (2017) Asia Pacific Journal of Multidisciplinary Research, 5, p. 3; Pressman, R.S., Software engineering-A practitioners approach (2015) Mc Graw-Hill International Edition, 2010; Matthias, R., Tools & Techniques Expert Opinion, Online, , http://www.idemployee.id.tue.nl/g.w.m.rauterberg/lecturenotes/UFTexp.ertopinion.pdf; Rumbaugh, J., Booch, G., Jacobson, I., (2017) The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual, , Addison Wesley; Dumas, M., Ter Hofstede, A.H., UML activity diagrams as a workflow specification language (2001) International Conference on the Unified Modeling Language, pp. 76-90. , Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, October; Jena, A.K., Swain, S.K., Mohapatra, D.P., A novel approach for test case generation from UML activity diagram (2014) Issues and Challenges in Intelligent Computing Techniques (ICICT), 2014 International Conference on, pp. 621-629. , IEEE, February; Ikram, M.T., Butt, N.A., Hussain, A., Nadeem, A., Testing from uml design using activity diagram: A comparison of techniques (2015) International Journal of Computer Applications, 131, p. 5; Seidl, M., Scholz, M., Huemer, C., Kappel, G., The use case diagram (2015) UML@ Classroom, pp. 23-47. , Springer, Cham",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2018","3 September 2018 through 5 September 2018",,142373,,9781538658215,,,"English","Proc.

To imagine the severances of it, 10.000 KM of highway can be built with that much amount of fund. Several responses has been done by Indonesian government to fight corruption from both prevention and persecution. This work focuses on the development of a web application aimed to provide insight to corruption case per province in Indonesia. The web application was developed using Machine Learning, specifically Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Web crawling and web scraping techniques are used to gather news content from 7 major news portal in Indonesia. Accuracy is measured by comparing correct prediction by ANN to its true value. Upon finding corruption news, data is saved and further analysis is done to establish the number of corruption news per region. Finally, the output is visualized using Google Map API. The purpose of this work is to provide regional depiction of corruption case to give further insight to be used by decision makers. Upon using this web application, objectivity of program development is expected to increase. The final output of the web application is a map of corruption case in Indonesia per region. The accuracy of ANN used in this work to classify corruption and non-corruption news is 96.91 % using Sigmoid Activation Function. © 2018 IEEE.","corruption mapping; corruption prevention; machine learning; web application","Application programs; Backpropagation; Decision making; E-learning; Information management; Learning systems; Mapping; Neural networks; Web crawler; Back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN); corruption prevention; Decision makers; Google map api; Program development; Sigmoid activation function; WEB application; Web scrapings; Crime",,,,"Binus University: 024/KM/PNT/2018","This work is supported by Directorate General of Research and Development Strengthening, Indonesian Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, as a part of National Strategic Institutional Research Grant to Binus University titled “Pengembangan Sistem Pemetaan Kasus Korupsi Berdasarkan Indeks Persepsi Korupsi Dengan Menggunakan Teknik Text Mining” or “The Development of Corruption Case Mapping Based on Corruption Perception Index using Text Mining” with contract number: 024/KM/PNT/2018 and contract date: 6 March 2018.","Pradiptyo, R., Partohap, T.H., Pramashavira, Korupsi Struktural; Analisis Database Korupsi Versi 4 (2001-2015), , http://cegahkorupsi.feb.ugm.ac.id/publikasi-/Database%20Korupsi%20V%204-5April16_RP_VR_THP.pdf, 5 April 2016[Accessed September 2016]; Rose-Ackerman, S., Palifka, B.J., (2016) Corruption and Government: Causes, Consequences, and Reform, 2nd Ed., Cambridge: Cambridge, , University Press; Jain, A.K., Corruption: A review (2001) Journal of Economic Surveys, 15 (1), pp. 71-122; Sommer, U., Bloom, P.B.-N., Arikan, G., Does faith limit immorality? the politics of religion and corruption (2013) Democratization, 20 (2), pp. 287-309; Madsen, F.G., Corruption: A global common evil (2013) The RUSI Journal, 158 (2), pp. 26-38; International, T., Slow, Imperfect Progress Across Asia Pacific, "" 21 February 2018, , https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/slow_imperfect_progress_across_asia_pacific, [Accessed 21 May 2018]; Olken, B.A., Pande, R., (2011) Corruption in developing countries Scholars at HARVARD; International, G., (2018) Corruption Continues to Plague Indonesia, , http://news.gallup.com/poll/157073/corruptioncontinues-plague-indonesia.aspx, [Accessed 21 May 2018]; Henderson, J.V., Kuncoro, A., Corruption in Indonesia (2004) National Bureau of Economic Research, pp. 1-38; Indonesia Corruption Watch Survei Nasional Anti Korupsi, , https://antikorupsi.org/sites/default/files/files/Kajian/Temuan%20Hasil%20Survey%20Anti%20Korupsi%202017.pdf, 26 July 2017.

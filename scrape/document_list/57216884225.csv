The lack of cardiologists makes it difficult for the community to get medical care. The development of artificial intelligence made is possible to assist the community in detecting whether the patient's heart is healthy or not. In this work, we implemented genetic algorithm to optimize the architecture of artificial neural network from previous work and used same dataset from Cleveland Heart Disease Data. We have succeeded in getting an accuracy, precision, and recall of 93.4%, 89.7%, and 97.2% respectively, which is relatively higher compared to previous papers. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Major Indonesian companies experience difficulties to link the business objectives with IT implementation, that lead to creating major problems, such as: ineffective IT investment, major complaints amongst potential stakeholders, etc. The article takes the case study of one of the largest hospital chains, XYZ Hospital that has 21 subsidiaries operating in major cities in Indonesia. Currently, The XYZ hospital has cloud-based computer system that integrates entire business processes in Hospital Information System (HIS). Due to its all advance computer systems, ironically, the HIS receives many complaints and dissatisfaction amongst major stakeholders of the hospital. The director has risen the issue to evaluate the current HIS development. For this reason, the article proposes the popular Enterprise Architecture, Zachman framework to assess the current business process in the organisation. To simplify the discussion, the framework is simplified to the essential component of 3x3 matrix, and links them with 3 important stakeholder's perspectives of HIS development: planner (scope), owner (enterprise model) and designer (system model). The outcome is expected to provide reference for those important stakeholders for further HIS development. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Pai, J., An empirical study of the relationship between knowledge sharing and is/it strategic planning (issp) (2006) Management Decision, 44, pp. 105-122. , https://doi.org/10.1108/00251740610641490; Theresa Lee, A.T.-K.P.R., Amir Hossein, G., Strategic information system planning in healthcare organizations (2015) Journal of Organizational and End User Computing, pp. 1-31; Hoo, J.W., Ivan, M.H., Martin Haudy, N., (2016) Penggunaan Is Success Model, Model Kano Dan Quality Function Deployment (Qfd) Dalam Upaya Meningkatkan Kualitas Hospital Information System (His) di Rumah Sakit Xyz; Albertus Handoko, M.D.I., Muhammad, R., (2016) Tingkat Penerimaan Dan Penghalang Penggunaan Simrs Pada Rs Xyz Menggunakan Metode Penelitan Sem-pls Dan Dematel; Zachman, J.A., A framework for information systems architecture (1987) IBM Systems Journal, 26, pp. 276-292; Giachetti, R.E., (2010) Design of Enterprise Systems: Theory, Architecture, and Methods; Op'T Land, M., Proper, E., Waage, M., Cloo, J., Steghuis, C., (2009) Enterprise Architecture: Creating Value by Informed Governance, , The Enterprise Engineering Series (Berlin: Springer); Lankhorst, M., (2009) Enterprise Architecture at Work: Modelling, Communication and Analysis, , https://books.google.de/books?id=HYAByKlCeYgC, The Enterprise Engineering Series) (Berlin Heidelberg: Springer); Rajan, A.P., Shanmugapriyaa, (2013) Evolution of Cloud Storage As Cloud Computing Infrastructure Service, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1303, CoRR, vol. abs/1308.1303; Chung, S.-P., Lu, Y.-J., Lai, Y.-C., (2017) Cloud Computing with Single Server Threshold and Double Congestion Thresholds, 3",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd Nommensen International Conference on Technology and Engineering 2019, NICTE 2019","25 July 2019 through 26 July 2019",,157456,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The development of the ERP Quality model is based on the IS success model of DeLone and Mclean and the ERP quality model developed by Deshmukh. This research model consists of variable 9, namely information quality, system quality, vendor quality, training, hardware and software, top management support, skill of workforce, project management, perceive ERP benefits and ERP system success. Analysis using SPSS software using questionnaires that are distributed directly to 32 respondents. The results of this study are in the form of ERP Quality models with 9 variables and 44 instruments that have been validated in accordance with the provisions of the Validity and reliability test. From this result can be used in research with respondents who are more appropriate or larger in a Higher Education sector who want to evaluate the performance of the use of ERP on HCM. © 2019 IEEE.","ERP quality models; HCM; higher education sector","Human resource management; Information management; Project management; Resource allocation; Software quality; Surveys; ERP implementation; Hardware and software; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Information quality; Quality models; Reliability test; Top management support; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,"Davenport, T.H., Putting the enterprise into the enterprise system (1998) Harvard Bus.

It was due to the company size, as deploying a proper IT service and risk management are not cheap, hence there is no economic value to deploy an end to end IT service and risk management solution.

At first, local startup online companies learned that free stuffs will attract traffics and once you get the traffic, revenue will follow. However, it doesn't come easily. PT IP, as a local online escrow service provider for C to C, transaction traffics were dropped to more than 80% after they start to charge the transactions with a very low administration fee. While PT PS, which offers part time jobs to freelancers, had a different strategy, they charged their services from the day one.

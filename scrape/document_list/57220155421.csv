Internships are important because they introduce students to the world of work, so that students not only learn theory, but also practice. The current condition where the world is hit by the Covid 19 pandemic makes many students unable to physically intern. Students cannot come to work and to clients due to social distancing. Augmented reality is one of the solutions so that students can get an augmented internship experience. This research is a descriptive qualitative research. In this study, we present data in the form of literature reviews and observations regarding the use of augmented reality in providing internship experiences to students who specialize in the field of auditing science. The results of our research state that augmented reality is more widely used in providing augmented experiences, students can gain work experience without having to meet people physically, however, some challenges must also be considered in augmented development and augmented reality in audit learning, including: content problems, content development costs are still expensive, and also the issue of health problems after usage. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

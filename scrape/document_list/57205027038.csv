They become an asset for companies that contain important insights and support in decision-making processes. Big data is one of technologies that used by many organizations for managing store data and data analysis. Therefore, storage management is one of important processes in big data management to ensure that data are stored correctly, safely and easily to be accessed. Despite having many advantages, big data technology still has several issues on storage management, especially if we relate between big data and cloud computing, such as data security which is very important. In this paper, we reviewed the previous works for data security in storage management in big data technology and provide a suggestion to answer the challenge of data security. © 2018 IEEE.","big data; cloud computing management; security; storage","Cloud computing; Decision making; Digital storage; Energy storage; Information management; Storage management; Big data technologies; Decision making process; security; Semi-structured; Big data",,,,"Binus University","VI.

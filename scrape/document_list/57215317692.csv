The main objective of this study is how to find the factors that influence the behavior of lecturers when receiving and using the LMS. This study uses the UTAUT 2 and Trust method to identify the factors that influence the acceptance and use of LMS for university lecturers. The data was collected and analyzed using SEM-PLS. The results of this study indicate that performance expectancy, habit and trust have the significant influence on the acceptance of the application (behavioral intention), while habit and behavioral intention are the influential factor in the use of the application (use behaviour). © 2019 IEEE.","learning management system; SEM-PLS; teaching learning process; trust; university; UTAUT2","Information management; Learning management system; Teaching-learning process; trust; university; UTAUT2; Learning systems",,,,,"Adzharuddin, N.A., Hwei Ling, L., Learning management system (lms) among university students: Does it work?

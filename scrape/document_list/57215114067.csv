To accommodate this requirement many higher education's institutions try to create new initiatives to enrich the graduate's competency of students with working experience so it can reduce the gap competency that industry faced when they recruit fresh graduate. One of the solutions proposed by XYZ university for higher education institution is to create enrichment program. The enrichment program is a program to increase student experience in real world work environment. In this program, the students will involve in working environment to learn how to be the worker in company and they will do all responsibility as an employee. To facilitate the enrichment program can running well, this study will propose the systems to accommodate enrichment program operation. Therefore, the design of this system aims to identify, analyze needs, and design a website-based application that is integrated with learning management systems so it can be used easily by parties involved in the enrichment processes, such as student, study program departments, enrichment program division, and company as an enrichment partner. This application is designed using System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) method which refers to architecture design, interface design, and database design. The result of this study is the model of enrichment systems that can facilitate the daily operation of enrichment program to accommodate the requirement of each party (student, study program, enrichment division, and company as partner). © 2019 IEEE.","competency; enrichment; graduate; model; SDLC","Application programs; Blast enrichment; Education computing; Employment; Life cycle; Models; Architecture designs; competency; Educational institutions; graduate; Higher education institutions; Learning management system; SDLC; System development life cycles; Students",,,,,"Sanchez, O.P., Terlizzi, M.A., Roberto, H., Cesar, D.O., Cost and time project management success factors for informa-tion systems development projects (2017) Int.

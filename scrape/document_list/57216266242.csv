Cesarean section cannot be performed if there is no agreement from the patient or family members regarding the surgery. In recent years, the use of machine learning in predicting disease has increased rapidly. One classification technique used in machine learning is artificial neural networks. In this study, we used backpropagation neural networks to predict cesarean section. This study uses a dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains information about the results of the cesarean section of 80 pregnant women with essential characteristics of labor problems in the medical field. Model evaluation is performed using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values. The area under curves (AUC) and ROC curves are used to calculate performance evaluations. Based on experimental results, research shows that backpropagation neural networks can be used as an alternative model in determining the cesarean section. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

Experimental research was conducted for four weeks with learning using e-learning media as an experimental group (n = 32) and using book-based learning as a control group (n = 30). This study used a quasi-experimental method with a pretest and posttest control group design. The research instrument was taken from observations and scores on student learning outcomes. The data were analyzed using a quantitative statistical method. Based on data, the researchers know that a teacher plays an essential role in developing student learning media through ICT based learning design. Also, the results of the study based on Mann-Whitney N-gain score of students’ comprehension ability obtained a significance value of 0.00 less than α = 0.05 so that H0 was rejected. This result shows that the ability of students to understand sci ence using e-learning media is significantly better than students who get book-based learning. © International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

Early detection and accurate diagnosis of diabetes can reduce the risk of complications. In recent years, the use of machine learning in predicting disease has gradually increased. A promising classification technique in machine learning is the use of support vector machines in combination with radial basis function kernels (SVM-RBF). In this study, we used SVM-RBF to predict diabetes. The study used a Pima Indian diabetes dataset from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. The subjects were female and ≥ 21 years of age at the time of the index examination. Our experiment design used 10-fold cross-validation. Confusion matrix and ROC were used to calculate performance evaluation. Based on the experimental results, the study demonstrated that SVM-RBF shows promise in aiding diagnosis of Pima Indian diabetes disease in the early stage. © IJTech 2016.","Diabetes; Pima dataset; SVM-RBF",,,,,,,"Abdillah, A.A., Murfi, H., Satria, Y., Uji Kinerja Learning to Rank dengan Metode Support Vector Regression (2015) IndoMS Journal on Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 2 (1), pp. 15-25. , in Bahasa; Adankon, M.M., Cheriet, M., Model Selection for the LS-SVM: Application to Handwriting Recognition (2009) Pattern Recognition, 42 (12), pp. 3264-3270; Altman, D.G., (2006) Practical Statistics for Medical Research, , Chapman & Hall/CRC; Bishop, C.M., Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics) (2006), Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., Secaucus, New Jersey, USA; Cheng, H., Shan, J., Ju, W., Guo, Y., Zhang, L., Automated Breast Cancer Detection and Classification using Ultrasound Images: A Survey (2010) Pattern Recognition, 43 (1), pp. 299-317; Cristianini, N., Shawe-Taylor, J., An Introduction to Support Vector Machines: and other Kernel-based Learning Methods (2000), Cambridge University Press, New York, New York, USA; Fawcett, T., An Introduction to ROC Analysis (2006) Pattern Recogn.

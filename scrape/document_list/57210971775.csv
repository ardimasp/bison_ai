Cloud computing can facilitate controlled distribution of blood by using an information system. The problems that occurs in the distributions of blood at the hospitals in Indonesia are sometimes the distributions are not controlled, so the blood may run out of stock caused by inequality of blood needs, difficulty in finding blood donors, and don't have an integrated system. The purpose of this study is to propose a connecting system that integrates Indonesian society who can be personal donor to help blood supply availability of UTD PMI using BBIS (Blood Bank Management System) based on cloud computing. The research methodology is collecting data with a systematic literature review and referring to previous studies, related to the current conditions in Indonesia. The result in this study is to propose Blood Bank Information System (BBIS), featured of application, dashboard, module and network architecture. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Are the concepts of business intelligence applicable to schools? If that is the case, then the primary and secondary education sectors should be replete with examples of institutions that leverage business intelligence to achieve operational excellence. This paper discusses the need for business intelligence from the perspectives of teachers in academic services, perceptions of application and benefits. However, although some examples exist, they are the exception rather than the rule. We believe there is tremendous value to school institutions that develop initiatives to achieve business objectives. The business intelligence can be classified as support for teaching staff decision making. The conclusion is that business intelligence could be used in schools, facilitating the business intelligence within the organization for academic services. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Application; Benefit; Business intelligence; School","Applications; Competitive intelligence; Decision making; Education; Societies and institutions; Teaching; Ubiquitous computing; Wireless sensor networks; Benefit; Business intelligence systems; Business objectives; Operational excellence; Primary and secondary education; School; Teaching staff; Information analysis",,,,,"Fact Gap Fuels ERP Investments and Invites Printer Vendors to Ride the Wave, , http://www.techexchange.com/thelibrary/RideTheWave.html; Marchand, D.A., Kettinger, W.J., Rollins, J.D., (2002) Information Orientation: The Link to Business Performance, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Stackowiak, R., Rayman, J., Greenwald, R., (2007) Oracle Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence Solutions, , Wiley Publishing, Indianapolis; Zeng, L., Xu, L., Shi, Z., Wang, M., Wu, W., Techniques, process, and enterprise solutions of business intelligence (2007) IEEE Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 6, p. 4722. , Taipei, Taiwan, 8-11 Oct 2006; Arnott, D., Pervan, G., A critical analysis of decision support systems research (2005) J Inf Technol, 20 (2), pp. 67-87; Williams, S., Williams, N., (2007) The Profit Impact of Business Intelligence, , Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco; Wang, Z., (2005) Business Intelligence, , DrMaster Culture Limited Company, Taipei; Goebel, M., Le, G., (1999) A Survey of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Software Tools, 1 (1). , ACM, New York; Albert, S., Knowledge management: Living up to the hope (1998) Midrange Syst, 11 (13), p. 52; Malhotra, Y., From information management to knowledge management: Beyond hi-tech hidebound systems (2000) Knowledge Management, pp. 37-62. , In: Srikantaiah TK, Koenig MED, Information Today, Medford; Chamoni, P., Gluchowski, P., Integration trends in business intelligence systems—an empirical study based on the business intelligence maturity model (2004) Wirtschaftsinformatik, 46 (2), pp. 119-128; Williams, S., Delivering strategic business value (2004) Strateg Finance, 86 (2), pp. 40-48; Najjar, L., (2002) The Impact of Information Quality and Ergonomics on Service Quality in the Banking Industry, , University of Nebraska, Lincoln; Salaun, Y., Flores, K., Information quality: Meeting the needs of the consumer (2001) Int J Inf Manage, 21 (1), pp. 21-37","Kurniawan, Y.; Information Systems Department, Bina Nusantara UniversityIndonesia","Pan Y.Yi G.Chao H.-C.Park J.J.","Future Technology Research Association International","Springer Verlag","2nd FTRA International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing Application and Wireless Sensor Network, UCAWSN 2014","7 July 2014 through 10 July 2014",,114299,18761100,9789401796170,,,"English","Lect.

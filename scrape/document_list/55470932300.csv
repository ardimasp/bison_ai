Children can distinguish television advertisements from programmes by about 5 years of age. Although previous researchers have investigated television advertising, little attention has been given to advertisements in other media, even though other media, especially the Internet, have become important channels of marketing to children. We showed children printed copies of invented web pages that included advertisements, half of which had price information, and asked the children to point to whatever they thought was an advertisement. In two experiments we tested a total of 401 children, aged 6, 8, 10 and 12 years of age, from the United Kingdom and Indonesia. Six-year-olds recognized a quarter of the advertisements, 8-year-olds recognized half the advertisements, and the 10- and 12-year-olds recognized about three-quarters. Only the 10- and 12-year-olds were more likely to identify an advertisement when it included a price. We contrast our findings with previous results about the identification of television advertising, and discuss why children were poorer at recognizing web page advertisements. The performance of the children has implications for theories about how children develop an understanding of advertising. © 2009 The British Psychological Society.",,"advertizing; age; aptitude; article; association; child; computer program; concept formation; discrimination learning; female; human; Internet; male; pattern recognition; recognition; Advertising as Topic; Age Factors; Aptitude; Child; Concept Formation; Cues; Discrimination Learning; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Recognition (Psychology); Software",,,,,"Austin, M.J., Reed, M.L., Targeting children online: Internet advertising ethics issues (1999) Journal of Consumer Marketing, 16, pp. 590-612; Auty, S., Lewis, C., Exploring children's choice: The reminder effect of product placement (2004) Psychology and Marketing, 21, pp. 697-713; Berti, A.E., Bombi, A.S., The development of the concept of money and its value: A longitudinal study (1981) Child Development, 52, pp. 1179-1182; Blades, M., (2007) Does children's ability to understand advertisements depend on cognitive development or on experience?, , Poster presented at the Biennial Conference of the Society for Research in Child Development, March 2007, Boston, USA; Blosser, B.J., Roberts, D.F., Age differences in children's perceptions of message intent.

Along with ICT evolution, threats (including theft of information) increase and electronic systems are adopted. As a government agency in higher education with the country's strategic data, XYZ cannot escape hackers trying to access the assets. Strategic assets include system and company's data as well as systems and data which might be taken for granted by irresponsible parties. Therefore, it is necessary to secure information and data systems in XYZ. Moreover to test whether the implemented cyber security system can optimally standardize the company's information and data systems. The application of Security Information Event Management (SIEM) to cyber security systems to detect incoming threat alerts and block access to suspicious threats. While the honeypot is used to deceive the hacker into a fake system intentionally attacked and learning the tricks that intruders use when performing the action. The results of the test of the application of SIEM and Honeypot at XYZ can monitor the monitoring of information system and data-related threats in real-time, and deter and transmit cyber-attacks to adequately protect information security so that the use of cyber security systems with SIEM & Honeypot can secure the information and data systems owned by XYZ optimal. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Cyber Security; Honeypot; Information Technology; Realtime; SIEM; Threats",,,,,,"Indranjit, R.E., (2011) Pengantar Konsep Keamanan Informasi di Dunia Cyber; Riyanarto, S., Irsyat, I., (2009) Sistem Manajemen Keamanan Informasi.; Deris, S., Jurusan Sistem Komputer; Mokube, I., Adams, M., (2007) ACMSE, pp. 321-325; O'Brien James, A., (2005) Introduction to Information System; Research, G., How to deploy SIEM technology (2011) Technical Report; Mokube, I., Adams, M., (2007) ACMSE, pp. 321-325; Lance, S., (2012) Honeypots: Tracking Hackers",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","2019 International Conference on Engineering, Technologies, and Applied Sciences, ICETsAS 2019","17 October 2019 through 18 October 2019",,161610,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

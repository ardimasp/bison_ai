To appeal to their current and potential customers, a company must understand the market interests. Companies can segment their customers by using surveys and telemetry data to get to know the customer’s interests. One way of segmenting the customer is by grouping or clustering them according to their interests and behaviors. In this study, the k-prototypes clustering algorithm, which is an improved combination of k-means and k-modes algorithm, will be used to cluster a behavioral data that contains both numerical and categorical attribute, obtained from a survey conducted on teenagers into clusters of 4, 5, and 6. Each cluster will contain teenagers with certain behavior different from other clusters. And then by analyzing the results, advertisers will be able to define a profile that indicates their interests regarding the internet, social media and text messaging, effectively revealing the kind of ad that would be relatable for them. © BEIESP.","Behavioral data; Cluster Analysis; Interest; K-Prototypes",,,,,,"Lenhart, A., Mobile access shifts social media use and other online activities (2015) Teens, Social Media & Technology Overview, , http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/09/mobile-access-shifts-social-media-use-and-other-online-activities/; Wright, E., Khanfar, N.M., Harrington, C., Kizer, L.E., The Lasting Effects Of Social Media Trends On Advertising (2016) J.

DPC practically implemented new tax return processing system to replace the old system, however the performance of the new system was not on a par with the old one, at the beginning. Then, DPC made several improvements to increase new system's performance. This study aims to measure the improvements made by DPC by using Six Sigma approach. The approach is functioned to assess data processing performance through DMAIC concept: i.e. define, measure, analyse, improve, and control. With the DMAIC concept, improvement exposes better result, the average value of six sigma significantly escalated by 0.97 to 2.56. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data handling; Process engineering; Process monitoring; Risk management; Systems engineering; Taxation; Work simplification; Average values; Indonesia; Performance measurements; Processing performance; Processing systems; Six sigma approaches; System's performance; Tax returns; Six sigma",,,,,"Kaushik, P., Khanduja, D., (2009) Total Qual.

Deep learning model that is most often used for time series prediction is LSTM. LSTM is widely used because of its excellence in remembering very long sequences. However, doing training on models that use LSTM requires a long time. Trying from one model to another model that use LSTM will take a very long time, thus a method is needed for optimizing hyperparameter to get a model with a small RMSE. This research proposed Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) as a method in optimizing hyperparameter for models that use LSTM. ABC is a metaheuristic method that mimics the behavior of bee colonies in foraging. Optimized hyperparameter in this research consisted of sliding window size, number of LSTM units, dropout rate, regularizer, regularizer rate, optimizer and learning rate. In this research the proposed method called as ABC-LSTM. Bitcoin prices historical data was used as the dataset for evaluating the prediction of the models. The best ABC-LSTM model resulted best RMSE of 189.61 compared to model that use LSTM without optimization resulted best RMSE of 236.17. This result showed that ABC-LSTM model outperformed models that use LSTM without optimization. © 2019 ASTES Publishers.

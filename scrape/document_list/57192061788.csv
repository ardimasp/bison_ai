From 1 January 2020 to 15 April 2020, the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information was able to identify 534 misinformation circulating in the country. False information during a pandemic may pose a serious threat to public health. Therefore, this study aims to identify the type and claims of misinformation from all 534 articles. Also, based on the results, this study aims to give recommendations for dealing with misinformation in Indonesia. This research uses a qualitative approach through systematic analysis, where all articles were analyzed by three human coders based on a predefined coding scheme. Results show that the most common type is a reconfiguration from old or genuine materials compared to fully fabricated content. While the most common claims are concerning community spread and public authority action. Based on the results, this paper recommends reducing the number of misinformation through three perspectives - identification of misinformation, platforms, and support for targeted people. © 2020 IEEE.","COVID-19; Disinformation; Indonesia; Misinformation","Information management; Coding scheme; Indonesia; Public authorities; Qualitative approach; Systematic analysis; Health risks",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

The account gains popularity among citizens because of the approach they used, such as humour and using conversational tone on each tweet, which is not common for government agencies, especially the military. The purpose of this research is to explore how government agency uses a new platform to increase engagement to the public and to generate some conceptual communication strategies used by TNI AU. This article used a qualitative methodology. Data was collected using virtual observation, interviews with representatives from the Public Relations of TNI AU and Twitter Indonesia. The result shows these strategies include fact-finding, using a conversational tone, emoticon power, stay up to date with the current situation, promote credibility via activation, and timely distribution. The conversational tone will also improve interactivity especially on Twitter. The result suggests that government agencies should use social media to increase the quality of public communication. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Interactive communication; Public communication; TNI AU; Twitter",,,,,,"The authors wish to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members as well as DISPENAU team.","Ames, D., Pushing up to a point: Assertiveness and effectiveness in leadership and interpersonal dynamics (2009) Research in Organizational Behavior, 29 (2009), pp. 111-133; (2016) #TrenSosial: Kicauankicauan Lucu TNI AU lewat akun Twitter [#SocialTrend: Hilarious tweets of TNI AU (Indonesian Air Force) through Twitter accounts], , https://www.bbc.com/indonesia/majalah/2016/03/160331_trensosial_tni_au, BBC.

In today's digital era, social media is not only a means of communication but also a means of self-expression, used by both individuals and organizations. The utilization of social media, especially by brands are interesting to observe. This research focused on question of how social media platforms were utilized by each brand to achieve branding and marketing goals? At present, little work has been carried out regarding this topic, especially for Indonesian brands. By examining the elements of how these brands used social media platforms, hopefully it can enlighten others to strengthen their online brands presence and identity. Using qualitative approach, and case study as a method, this study chose three Indonesian brands in F B (CHAMBER), fashion (PVRA) and personal (Edho Zell) which represents a brand in products, services, and personal self. Content analysis were used to analyze and build common themes. Data analysis followed three phases of data reduction, data display, and interpretation. The result shows that the utilization of social media for these three brands is still for short-term marketing goals or activations. There is little or almost no long-term relationships engagement in the posts. Moreover, the three brands already knew their target audiences in social media. And although these brands have different goals of social media utilization, they already developed solid brand identity. © 2019 IEEE.","brand identity; brand story; digital marketing; social media","Commerce; Information management; Marketing; Brand identity; brand story; Content analysis; Digital marketing; Long-term relationships; Qualitative approach; Social media; Social media platforms; Social networking (online)",,,,,,"Kemp, S., (2019) Digital 2019: Indonesia, , https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2019-Indonesia, Retrieved June 2019; Bollier, S., (2014) Voting in the 'World's Social Media Capital, , http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/07/voting-worldssocial-media-capital-2014725397392826.html, Retrieved October 2017 from; Rampersad, H., A new blueprint for powerful and authentic personal branding (2008) Performance Improvement, 47 (6), pp. 34-37. , July; Diamond, S., (2013) The Visual Marketing Revolution: 26 Rules to Help Social Media Marketers Connect the Dots, , Que Publishing; Solis, B., (2017) You Are at the Center of the Conversation Prism, , http://www.briansolis.com/2013/07/you-are-at-thecenter-of-the-conversation-prism/, Retrieved March 2017 from; Goel, R., An empirical study to enquire the effectiveness of digital marketing in the challenging age with reference to Indian economy (2017) Pertanika Journals of Social Sciences and Humanities, 25 (4), pp. 1569-1584; Clarke, T., (2019) Instagram Stats That Marketers Can't Ignore This Year, , https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagramstatistics/, Retrieved June 2019 from; Ginsberg, K., Instabranding: Shaping the personalities of the top food brands on instagram (2015) The Elon Journal of Undergraduate Research in Communications, 6 (1), pp. 78-91; Lavoie, K.A., Instagram and branding: A case study of Dunkin' Donuts (2015) The Elon Journal of Undergraduate Research in Communications, 6 (2), pp. 79-90; Keller, K.L., Conceptualizing, measuring, and managing customerbased brand equity (1993) Journal of Marketing, 57 (1), pp. 1-22; Bauer, H.H., Stokburger-Sauer, N.E., Exler, S., Brand image and fan loyalty in professional team sport: A refined model and empirical assessment (2008) Journal of Sport Management, 22 (2), p. 205; Aaker, D., (2002) Building Strong Brands, , London: Simon & Schuster; Gladden, J.M., Funk, D.C., Developing an understanding of brand associations in team sport: Empirical evidence from consumers of professional sport (2002) Journal of Sport Management, 16 (1), p. 54; Ross, S.D., Segmenting sport fans using brand associations: A cluster analysis (2007) Sport Marketing Quarterly, 16 (1), pp. 15-24; Fournier, S., Avery, J., The uninvinted brand (2011) Business Horizons, 54 (3), pp. 193-207; Pedersen, P.M., Miloch, K.S., Laucella, P.C., Strategic sport communication (2007) Human Kinetics, 10 (2), pp. 176-187; Wallace, L., Wilson, J., Miloch, K., Sporting Facebook: A content analysis of NCAA organizational sport pages and Big 12 conference athletic department pages (2011) International Journal of Sport Communication, 4 (4), pp. 422-444; Kozinets, R.V., The field behind the screen: Using netnography for marketing research in online communities (2002) Journal of Marketing Research, 39 (1), pp. 61-72; Vollmer, C., Precourt, G., (2008) Always On: Advertising, Marketing, and Media in An Era of Consumer Control, , New York, NY:McGraw-Hill; Montoya, P., Vandehey, T., (2009) The Brand Called You, , USA:McGraw-Hill; Brakus, J., Brand experience: What is it?

There are two objectives of this study (1) to explore awareness of corporate reputation in 4-star and 5-star hotels; (2) to examine corporate efforts to gain corporate reputation in 4-star to 5-star hotels. The hotels studied are Grand Aston Yogyakarta (5-star hotel) and Swiss-Belinn Makassar Hotel (4-star hotel). The research uses a descriptive qualitative method; data was collected using semi-structured interviews and virtual observation. Results showed that both hotels are aware of corporate reputation in the service industry, and have implemented Grunig’s two-way asymmetrical model. However, both hotels do not have a particular strategy and seem to be overwhelmed with the information in social media. Each hotel needs to implement social media policy and strategy to gain insight into stakeholders’ feedbacks and current trends. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Corporate Reputation; Reputation awareness; Service companies",,,,,,,"Barnett, M.L., Jermier, J.M., Lafferty, B.A., Corporate reputation: The definitional landscape (2006) Corporate Reputation Review, 9 (1), pp. 26-38; Bennet, R., Kottasz, R., Practitioner perceptions of corporate reputation: An empirical investigation (2000) Corporate Communications: An International Journal, 5 (4), pp. 224-235; Caesar, L.A.Y., Performance excellence by transformational leadership in developing collectivistic culture for Indonesian companies (2016) Pertanika Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities, 24 (S), pp. 19-32; Davies, G., Chun, R., Kamins, M., Reputation gaps and the performance of service organizations (2010) Strategic Management Journal, pp. 530-546; Daymon, C., Holloway, I., (2002) Qualitative Research Methods in Public Relations, , London: Routledge; Denzin, N.K., Lincoln, Y.S., (2011) The SAGE Handbook of Qualitative Research, , Eds 4th ed.).

Without good education, employment opportunities will be limited and most will end up as blue collar workers. Al Ishlah PKBM is one of the community learning centres in Jakarta. For more than a decade, it has provided educational services for people who want to be more empowered through education. It is an alternative educational centre catering for all ages. The PKBM relies on good communication, both internal and external, and therefore, it needs a communication audit to comprehensively evaluate the quality of its internal communication, namely its ability to send, receive and share information with various audiences within the organisation. The aim of this research is to study how internal communication audit influences an organisation's performance. The results show there is a gap between the vision and mission of organisation. The managers of PKBM Al Ishlah still use the traditional way to manage its internal communication. It was found that the organisation lacks professionalism because it emphasises on the values of empathy. Thus, the centre needs to instil the importance of discipline which needs improvement.","Communication audit; Education; Non-profit organisation; Organisation performance",,,,,,,"Bartkus, B.R., Glassman, M., McAfee, R.B., A comparison the quality of European, Japanese and US mission statements: A content analysis (2004) European Management Journal, 22 (4), pp. 393-401; Carvalho, J.M.S., The crucial role of inal communication audit to improve internal and general market orientations (2013) Europe Scientific Journal, 9 (25), pp. 357-379; Clampitt, P., Berk, L., A communication audit of a paper mill (2000) Handbook of Communication Audits for Organizations, , In O.

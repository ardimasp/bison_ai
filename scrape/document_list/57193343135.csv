The underwear that had served to protect the body has shifted into a woman’s need to express their identity and one of their ways to seduce men. It is interesting to examine how underwear brands communicate their look and feel in a unique way to attract the attention of female consumers so that they buy the products. This journal examines some famous brands such as Victoria’s Secret, Wonderbra, Aubade, La Perla, Triumph, and La Senza in their efforts to attract the attention and shape consumer’s perception towards women’s underwear. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Brand; Core idea; Design; Look and feel; Women’s underwear",,,,,,"Sutton, T., Whelan, B.M., (2004) The Complete Color Harmony, , Rockport Publishers, Massachusetts; Olins, W., Olins, W., (2008) The Brand Handbook, , Thames & Hudson, United Kingdom; Wheeler, A., (2009) Designing Brand Identity: An Essential Guide for the Entire Branding Team, , John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New Jersey; Moule, K.R., Fisher, M., You Can Look But You Cannot Touch (2014) Human Ethology Bulletin, 29, p. 4; Daems, J., (2010) If Love is Blind … Why is Lingerie is So Popular?, , http://www.nu.nl/files/Lingerie1.pdf, Received Juny 20, 2015; Fashionbi, (2015) Undressing the Lingerie Market-Evolution and Global Perspective, , http://www.slideshare.net/fashionbi/undressing-the-lingerie-market, Juny 20, 2015; Thomas, P.W., (2014) Bra and Girdles History before 1950 Fashion History, , http://www.fashion-era.com/bras_and_girdles.htm, Juny 20, 2015; Seville, R., (2013) The Fabolous Women of Jean Paul Gaultier, , http://www.thestylecon.com/2013/11/13/women-jpg/, Received Juny 20, 2015; (2015), http://www.elle.co.za/2015-victorias-secret-fashion-show-looks/, Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show Looks, Received Juny 20, 2015, (2015); Lapointe, V., (2013) Lingerie Guide: La Perla SS13, , http://livefastmag.com/2013/01/lingerie-guide-la-perla-ss13/, Received Juny 20, 2015; (2013), http://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/News/11-sexy-celebrity-underwearads-20131003, 11 Sexy Celebrity Underwear Ads, Received Juny 20, 2015; Rafael, H., (2013), http://wardrobetrendsfashion.com/la-senza-lingerie-spring-2013/, La Senza Lingerie Spring 2013, Received Juny 20, 2015; Lingerietalk, (2015) Aubade Lingerie Calendar, , http://www.lingerietalk.com/2014/12/03/aubade/2015-aubade-lingeriecalendar, Received Juny 20, 2015, 2014","Warbung, T.; Bina Nusantara University, Jl.

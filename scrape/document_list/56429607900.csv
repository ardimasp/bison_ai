The quantitative method was used in this study with UTAUT 2 model approach. Analysis was carried out on the results of the distributed questionnaire through Google Form to respondents in various big companies using SEM-PLS analysis technique. The outcomes demonstrated that the Habit factor bigly affected the acknowledgment and utilization of Cloud ERP, while Behavioral Intention had a big effect on long-term use by users in big companies in Indonesia. Apart from these factors, it was also found that many users knew and wanted to use Cloud ERP, but there were still a few big companies in Indonesia that adopted the system. Based on all of these, Cloud ERP vendors have a great opportunity to market their products to big companies in Indonesia due to the high level of user interest in the system. In addition, Cloud ERP vendors can pay attention to the Habit and Behavioral Intention factors as priorities in marketing their product. © 2019 IEEE.","big companies; cloud ERP; quantitative; UTA UT 2; vendor","Commerce; Adoption factors; Behavioral intention; Large companies; quantitative; Quantitative method; User interests; UTA UT 2; vendor; Information management",,,,,"Asri, M.N., Hashim, N.H., Ismail, D., Desa, W.N., Pearson product moment correlation (ppmc) and principal component analysis (PCA) for objective comparison and source determination of unbranded black ballpoint pen inks (2016) Forensic Sciences, pp. 1-18; Attuquayefio, S., Addo, H., Review of studies with utaut as conceptual framework (2014) European Scientific Journal, 10, pp. 249-258; Columbus, L., (2014) Why Cloud ERP Adoption Is Faster Than Gartner Predicts, , https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2014/02/07/why-clouderp-adoption-is-faster-than-gartner-predicts/#2dc6ef89dbb5, February 7; (2016) Unlocking the Benefits of Cloud-based ERP, , https://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2016/05/25/unlocking-the-benefits-ofcloud-based-erp/, May 25 Retrieved from The Wall Street Journal:; Elragal, A., Kommos, M.E., (2012) In-House Versus In-Cloud ERP Systems: A Comparative Study, , New Cairo: IBIMA; Endah, R.W., Uji Validitas dan Reliabilitas Dalam Penelitian Epidemiologi Kedokteran Gigi (2011) Stomatognatic, 8, pp. 27-34; Ettlie, J.E., Adequacy of stage models for decisions on adoption of innovation (1980) Psychological Reports, 46, pp. 991-995; Ghozali, I., (2011) Structural Equation Modelling: Metode Alternatif Dengan Partial Least Square PLS, , Semarang: Badan Penerbit Universitas Diponegoro; Gupta, A., Dogra, N., Tourist adoption of mapping apps: A utaut2 perspective of smart travellers (2017) Tourism and Hospitality Management, 23, pp. 145-161; Hair, J.F., Hult, G.T., Ringle, C.M., Sarstedt, M., (2014) A Primer on Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLSSEM), , California: SAGE; Heale, R., Twycross, A., Validity and reliability in quantitative research (2015) Evid Based Nurs, 18, pp. 66-67; Profil bisnis usaha mikro, kecil dan menengah (umkm) (2015) Jakarta: Kerjasama Lembaga Pengembangan Perbankan Indonesia Dan Bank Indonesia, , Lembaga Pengembangan Perbankan Indonesia, & Bank Indonesia; Peng, G.C., Gala, C., Cloud ERP: A new dilemma to modern organization?

Cyberbully and its impact have occurred around the world and now the number of cases are increasing. Cyberbullying detection is very important because the online information is too large so it is not possible to be tracked by humans. The purpose of this research is to construct a classification model with optimal accuracy in identifying cyberbully conversation using Naive Bayes method and Support Vector Machine (SVM) then applying n-gram 1 to 5 for the number of class 2, 4, and 11 for each method. Naive Bayes yields an average accuracy of 92.81%, SVM with a poly kernel yields an average accuracy of 97.11% It can be concluded that SVM with poly kernel yields higher accuracy than SVM with other kernels, Naive Bayes, and Kelly Reynolds research method of decision tree (J48) and k-NN. © 2017 IEEE.","cyberbully; naive bayes; support vector machine","Classifiers; Computer crime; Decision trees; Nearest neighbor search; Text mining; Classification models; Cyber bullying; Cyberbully; Naive bayes; Number of class; On-line information; Optimal accuracy; research methods; Support vector machines",,,,,"Kowalski, R.M., Limber, S.P., Agatston, P.W., (2012) Cyberbullying: Bullying in the Digital Age, , West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell; Poland, S., (2010) Cyberbullying Continues to Challenge Educators, 1, p. 5. , https://www.districtadministration.com/article/cyberbullyingcontinues-challenge-educators, [Online]; Shapka, J., Amos, H., (2012) Cyberbullying and Bullying Are Not the Same: UBC Research, , http://news.ubc.ca/2012/04/13/cyberbullying-and-bullying-are-notthe-same-ubc-research/, 13 April, [Online]; Yin, D., Xue, Z., Hong, L., Detection of harassment on web 2.0 (2009) Content Analysis in the WEB 2.0 (CAW2.0) Workshop at WWW 2009, pp. 1-7; Dinakar, K., Reichart, R., Lieberman, H., Modeling the detection of textual cyberbullying (2011) International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, pp. 11-17; Reynolds, K., Using machine learning to detect cyberbullying (2012) The Faculty of Ursinus College in Fulfillment of the Requirements for Distinguished Honors in Computer Science, pp. 1-4; Hee, C.V., Lefever, E., Verhoeven, B., Mennes, J., Desmet, B., Pauw, G.D., Daelemans, W., Hoste, V., Automatic detection and prevention of cyberbullying (2015) HUSO 2015: The First International Conference on Human and Social Analytics, pp. 13-18; Vercellis, C., (2009) Business Intelligence: Data Mining and Optimization for Decision Making, , Politecnico di Milano, Italy.: Wiley",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1st International Conference on Informatics and Computational Sciences, ICICoS 2017","15 November 2017 through 16 November 2017",,134505,,9781538609033,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

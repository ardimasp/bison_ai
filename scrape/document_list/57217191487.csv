Technically, most encryption processes are ranging from hundreds of milliseconds. If there is a lot of encrypting process, then the performance will be getting bottleneck and the transaction's speed is being slowed down. In this paper, a promising scheme by adding GZIP compression on the former RSA encryption method to increase speed is proposed; thus every transaction is going to require less times, therefore the number of failed transactions or requests will be reduced. Hence, this way makes the transaction easier for customers to do. The result of little experimental test shows that using XOR to stream cipher-text to replace the absent of padding into specific bytes shows a lot of performance increase resulting other factors such as availability also affected without sacrificing the security level. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Risk management; Systems engineering; Application Servers; Experimental test; RSA encryption; Security level; Stream Ciphers; Cryptography",,,,,"Rachmawati, D., Budiman, M.A., Lubis, R.S., (2018) IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 434, pp. 1-6; Baheti, A., Singh, L., Khan, A.U., (2014) IEEE-Fourth International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies, pp. 664-668; Ahmed, M., Sazzad, T.M.S., Mollah, M.E., (2012) Int J Comput Sci Issues, 9, pp. 583-586; Klein, M., (2012) The TSEC/KW-26 (1st Ed.)

Face recognition is an example of authentication by using biometrics. Face recognition requires specific methods to obtain face representation as its features. There are many methods which have been developed to get these unique features, such as PCA, LDA, ICA and hybrid methods like ICA and SVM, Gabor and ICA and many others. This research develops a hybrid method from Gabor Wavelet and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) because during conducting literature reviews, the combination of these methods has never been found. The objective of this research is to create face recognition method with a better accuracy than the previous methods. Testing is conducted by using ORL face database and it gets around 95% accuracy rate. This result shows that the proposed method indicates a better accuracy compared with the previous methods. © 2015 IEEE.","Biometrics; Face Recognition; Gabor Wavelet; Non-negative Matrix Factorization; ORL Face Database","Authentication; Biometrics; Factorization; Intelligent systems; Matrix algebra; Biometrics authentication; Face recognition methods; Face representations; Gabor wavelets; Literature reviews; Nonnegative matrix factorization; ORL face database; Unique features; Face recognition",,,,,"Jain, A.K., Flynn, P., Ross, A.A., (2008) Handbook of Biometrics, , 1st ed.

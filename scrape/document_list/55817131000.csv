The bridge is important because it serves as a liaison between two separate places due to several conditions. This research is conducted to find out whether existing bridge can still meet the criteria of stress, deflection, and deformation based on load value factor, load action, and load combination on SNI 1725-2016. The earthquake load used is a response spectrum using SNI 2833: 2013 regulations[1]. This research uses finite element method using software midas civil software program. In this analysis it is found that the value of stress, deflection, and deformation on the bridge structure according to SNI 1725-2016 is greater than RSNI T 02-2005. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

To get a description of the structural behavior starting from the structure in linear elastic, the first yielding of the structural elements until the structure collapse due to earthquake load, it can be done with non-linear static analysis namely pushover analysis. In this study, the geometry of mid-rise reinforced concrete structure consists of four storey buildings. The dimensions of the column structure 400x400 mm and beam structure 250x500 mm, where the dimensions of the beams and columns are the same from the 1st floor to the 4th floor. To find out the behavior that affects the ductility value in mid-rise reinforced concrete structures, a variation material used in this study are the spacing of stirrup, ratio of longitudinal reinforcement, ratio of compressive and tensile longitudinal reinforcement, and compressive strength of concrete. Structural geometry modeling, structural loads, and modeling of material variations used the program SAP 2000. From the output of this program, an analysis of the value of curvature ductility and displacement ductility was performed.

For the cable-stayed bridge, the cable receives the load from the bridge deck and transfer it to the pylon. As the ambient temperature change, the internal force in bridge element including stayed cable will change. This research investigate the ambient temperature effect to the tension force of stayed cable of cable-stayed bridge by comparing the result of finite element model analysis with the field measurement form electromagnetic sensor data. The finite element model of Merah Putih Cable-Stayed Bridge has been developed based on detailed engineering design data. The finite element model is validated using the natural frequency data from dynamic load test of the bridge. The ambient temperature and bridge elements temperature were measured for 24 hours. The finite element analysis were conducted based on field measurement data and the contribution of pylon and girder temperature to the cable tension forces variation was investigated. The output of finite element analysis then compared to the actual cable tension as measured by an electromagnetic sensor. It was found that the ambient temperature will affecting the magnitude of tension force at stay cable and the variation of cable tension has similar pattern of both from the finite element model and electromagnetic data. As the temperature of bridge element increases or decreases, the bridge will experience a deformation. Since the stay cable connected to the pylon at one side and to the girder at the other side, its will make the stay cable elongated or contracted which in turn will affecting the tension force at stay cable. When evaluating the bridge condition based on the tension force at stay cable, the effect of temperature variation need to be considered. © BEIESP.","Cable; Cable tension; Cable-stayed bridge; Electromagnetic sensor; Finite element method; Temperature",,,,,"Binus University: 12/AKM/PNT/2019","This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Pengaruh Suhu Terhadap Perubahan Gaya di Kabel Jembatan” or “Temperature Effect to Cable Force Variation of Bridge” with contract number: 12/AKM/PNT/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","Chen, C., Wu, W., Liu, C., Effects of temperature variation on cable forces of an extradosed bridge (2012) 6Th European Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring; Vairo, G., Montassar, S., Mechanical modelling of stays under thermal loads (2012) Mechanics, Models and Methods, LNACM, 61, pp. 481-498; Suangga, M., Hidayat, I., Yuliastuti, C., Temperature effect on cable tension forces of cable-stayed bridge (2018) The 2Nd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, , 2018; Wang, L., Wu, Y., Thermal effect on damaged stay-cable (2014) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, 52 (4), pp. 1071-1082; Zhao, Y., Zhao, Y., Sun, C., Wang, Z., Temperature effect on tension forces and frequencies of suspended cables (2014) Proceedings of the 9Th International Conference on Structural Dynamics; Zhou, Y., Sun, L., Sun, S., Temperature field and its effect on a long-span steel cable-stayed bridge based on monitoring data (2013) The Thirteenth East Asia-Pacific Conference on Structural Engineering and Construction, pp. EASEC-13",,,,"Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication",,,,,22498958,,,,"English","Int.

In the design, it has been calculated the maximum load that can be received by each cable based on dead load, live load or environmental load. When the bridge operates, it is necessary to monitor the behavior of the bridge structure due to the work load based on the time function. It is very important for the bridge management to examine the cable forces that occur in real time, so that it can be immediately known if there is a cable force exceeding the maximum limit. One of the sensor tools that can be used to determine the frequency of the cable is accelerometer. The frequency data from accelerometer are calculated into the approach of formulas developed by Wei-Hua Hu, 2005. In this study, calculation cable forces consider the effect of sag cable or bending stiffness using Wei-Hua Hu formula. As a control data in cable force calculations, it used measurement data conducted by consultants. From the results for cable C7 located on left side of bridge needs to be re-tested. This happens because the value of the resulting cable force does not show similarity with the right-side (cable C7 located on right side). The cable C7 in left side of bridge has a frequency value of 1.24 and generate cable forces tends to decrease, where it should be increase for cables forces values. For other cable forces, the value of the cable force obtains a range difference between 0.28% - 9.23%. Longer cable such as cable M7, the cable force formula is less influenced by bending stiffness effects in calculation. In other words, the stiffness of the cable is small or does not affect the cable force. As for shorter cables in cables C2 and M2, the bending stiffness of the cables affects the calculation of the cable force. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Cables are used in a variety of structures that employ their unique characteristics to create efficient design tension members. The condition of the cable forces in the cable supported structure is an important indication of judging whether the structure is in good condition. Several methods have been developed to measure on site cable forces. Vibration technique using correlation between natural frequency and cable forces is a simple method to determine in situ cable forces, however the method need accurate information on the boundary condition, cable mass, and cable length. The natural frequency of the cable is determined using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) Technique to the acceleration record of the cable. Based on the natural frequency obtained, the cable forces then can be determine by analytical or by finite element program.

In this research, type I-Girder WIKA standard for bridges were considered with longitudinal spansof 35 m, transverse spans of 12.4 m, girder heightof2100 mm. The purpose of this study to calculate the deflection and stress at the girder with different standard for Highway Bridge.Three standards considered for this comparison including of Bina Marga, AASHTO, and British Standard.Based on the analysis, it was found that the value of the stress in the Ultimate Limit Stress (ULS) and Service Limit State (SLS)and the value of deflection are still below the allowable values. This indicates that the type I-Girder considered is meet all the criteria implied by the three design standards. The important aspect when designing a prestressed concrete bridge is a combination of loading, the resistance factor, the design criteria, and the limit valueof deflection. The different parameter between the design ctandardis the value of the resistance factor. Bina Marga and AASHTO standards use the resistance factor values of 0.75 and 0.9, while for a British Standard resistant factor is not adopted but the value of material factor (γm) is used with the value of 1.15. The value for short-term lossdue to concrete shortening of Bina Margais equal to zero. This is due to the tendon are tensionedsimultaneously. According to British Standard, long-term losses due to creep and shrinkage are calculated together, however for Bina Marga and the AASHTO LRFD calculations, separate analysis are required. © Research India Publications.","Design Standards; Prestressed Highway Bridge",,,,,,,"(2012) AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design specifications; (2011) Perencanaan Struktur Beton Pratekan Untuk Jembatan, , 021/BM/2011; Hussein, A., Strength Design Requirements of ACI-318M-02 Code, BS 8110, and EuroCode2 for Structural Concrete: A Comparative Study (2006) Journal of Engineering and Development, 10 (1); Lin, T.Y., (1963) Design of Prestressed Concrete Structure, , (2nd edition).New York:Wiley International Edition; Sankar, Midhun, B., Jacob, Priya, A., Comparison of Design Standarts for Steel Railways Bridges (2013) Journal of Engineering Research and Aplications(IJERA), pp. 1131-1138","Hidayat, I.; Civil Engineering Department, Bina Nusantara UniversityIndonesia",,,"Research India Publications",,,,,09734562,,,,"English","Int.

The purpose of this research was to perform a comparative analysis of the stress value due to the live load calculation program based on the results of Midas/Civil with the field measurement results and stress sensors determine the effect of the modulus of elasticity of concrete parameters on the stress value of pre-stressed bridge. The method used in this research is the analytical calculations based on actual conditions measured in the field. Loading test method is based on the actual condition of the integrated load testing methods. The results obtained in this research is when the load works right on top of the bridge girder then the stress value will be close to the actual stress value. In the effect analysis of the modulus of elasticity of concrete shows that the modulus does not affect the stress value. Moreover, on the diaphragm modeling workload which is right on top of the girder has less stress value. Therefore, it can be concluded that the program modeling results approaches with the actual conditions in the field, where the field measurements results are relatively the same compared to the results of the calculation program. © Research India Publications.","Bridge stress value; MIDAS civil; Modulus of Elasticity; Prestressed bridge",,,,,,,"(2008) ST350 Strain Transducer Instruction Manual, , Canada: Camphbell Scientific, Inc; Chen, W.F., Duan, L., (2000) Bridge Engineering Handbook, , London: Boca Raton; Perencanaan Struktur Beton Untuk Jembatan (Concrete Design for Bridge Structure), , Department of Public Works; Standar Pembebanan Untuk Jembatan (Standard of Loading for Bridge Structure), , Department of Public Works; Perencanaan Struktur Beton Pratekan Untuk Jembatan (Design Presstressed Concrete for Bridge Structure), , Bina Marga, Department of Public Works","Hidayat, I.; Civil Engineering Departement, Bina Nusantara UniversityIndonesia",,,"Research India Publications",,,,,09734562,,,,"English","Int.

PC Bridge girders have two types: Pre - tensioned girders and post - tensioned girders. In pre tensioned girders, prestressing in carried out first then after that the fresh concrete poured. The prestressing process in only carried off after the concrete has sufficient strength. In this study, analysis was conducted for PCI bridge girder with span is 40 meters. Based on the data geometry bridge dimension girder, material girder, and material strands cable, it will be analyzed to calculate the natural frequencies and moment capacity using finite element program (Midas/Civil program). So it can be estimated how much the percentage reduction prestress force on the bridge until PCI bridge structure collapses. From the calculation, it found that the pattern comparison between reduction prestressing force and natural frequency are linear. These results are also similar for natural frequency versus moment capacity.PCI bridge will collapse when the reduction prestreesing force of 45 % to 50 % from the total loss of prestressing. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,,"(2004) Perencanaan Struktur Beton Untuk Jembatan RSNI T-12-2004, , Badan Standarisasi Nasional.

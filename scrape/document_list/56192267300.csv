The growing of sophisticated technology has eased people's productivity. However, in the other hand, security risks have also grown without an equal degree of awareness of the society. The objective of this research is to design and develop an Android application that is able to draw a topology of a network and do a simple security assessment towards a host in order to detect host's vulnerability. The information gathered will be presented in a PDF report and can be used for maintenance purposes. The application will have wizard feature, where the user can analyze network and discover an underlying vulnerability with guided steps. The methodology is interview, literature study, observation and system design using object oriented approach. DroidGlance, an Android application that can draw a wireless network topology generator and help security tester analyze a host's vulnerability. The application main feature are Topology generator, Ping, Traceroute, Port Scanner, Vulnerability Checker, and Listen. These features are tested. These features are able to run well. However, they need several improvements for future development. © 2014 SERSC.","Android; Network; Security; Topology",,,,,,"Vanaubel, Y., Pansiot, J.J., Merindol, P., Donnet, B., Network fingerprinting: TTL-based router signatures (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 conference on Internet measurement conference, pp. 369-376. , New York: ACM New York; A penetration tester's toolkit (2012) Linux Journal, 213 (1). , 2012; Bauer, M., Paranoid Penguin: Checking Your Work with Scanners, Part I (of II): nmap (2001) Linux Journal, 13 (85 ES). , 2001; Barnett, J.R., Irwin, B., Towards a Taxonomy of Network Scanning Techniques (2008) Proceedings of the 2008 annual research conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists on IT research in developing countries: riding the wave of technology, pp. 1-7. , New York: ACM New York; Bartlett, G., Heidemann, J., Papadopoulos, C., Understanding passive and active service discovery (2007) Proceedings of the 7th ACM SIGCOMM conference on Internet measurement, pp. 57-70. , New York: ACM New York; Chakrabarti, S., Chakraborty, M., Mukhopadhyay, I., Study of snort-based IDS (2010) Proceedings of the International Conference and Workshop on Emerging Trends in Technology, pp. 43-47. , New York: ACM; Ehrenkranz, T., Li, J., On the state of IP spoofing defense (2009) Journal ACM Transactions on Internet Technology, 9 (2); Hytnen, R., Garcia, M., An analysis of wireless security (2006) Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges, pp. 210-216; Richardson, W.D., Gribble, D.S., Kohno, T., The limits of automatic OS fingerprint generation (2010), pp. 24-34. , New York: ACM; Treurniet, J., A network activity classification schema and its application to scan detection (2011) Journal IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON), 19 (5), pp. 1396-1404; Ali, S., Heriyanto, T., BackTrack 4: Assuring Security by Penetration Testing.

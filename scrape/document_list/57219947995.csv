The next generation of entrepreneurs, prospective entrepreneurs in the future, need to plan and implement technology to adapt to change. This research aims to find out what factors affect entrepreneurial students' interests and behaviour. This analysis is quantitative causality. As a grand theory we use UTAUT 2 Model. The data collection process uses primary data, which distributes questionnaires to students taking business classes. Testing hypothesis in this study uses a path analysis approach for structural equations modelling. We used statistical tools in data processing. The findings of our study show that varying results, perceptions of effort, social impact, circumstances, price values, behavioural intentions are affected. Though hedonic motivation has little effect on behavioural intent. Facilitating circumstances and behaviours often has a partly beneficial impact on the actions of usage. Conduct intent has a positive effect on the conduct of use. © 2020 EManuscript Technologies.

Although the e-Government program has been carried out by the Jakarta Capital City Provincial Government since 2015 through Jakarta Smart City, by implementing Citizen Relationship Management (CiRM) through eight complaint channels, where citizens can participate in city development. But in the past three years the number of complaints has continued to decline. On the other hand, the use of social media in the field of governance is a major trend in egovernment practices throughout the world, in an effort to support public information disclosure, efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability of governance. The gamification effect is believed to be able to overcome this problem, many studies have shown that the gamification effect has a major influence in activating individual motivation. We are using the Octalysys Gamification Framework to analyze Gamification in implementing CiRM. We obtained data from observations of the current system, interviews with related parties, and questionnaires to citizens of Jakarta as users of the complaint channel. The results of the analysis show the lack of use of game design elements in the CiRM complaint channel, additional gamification techniques is needed to increase citizens engagement and participation. The conclusion of our study is that Gamification is very instrumental in supporting the implementation of CiRM. So that hopes to strengthening the relationship between the Government and Citizens can be achieved. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Citizen Relationship Management; Gamification; Octalysis Gamification Framework; Social Media",,,,,,"(2018) Statistik Potensi Kelurahan Provinsi DKI Jakarta 2018, , BPS DKI Jakarta; Gabrielli, S., Design challenges in motivating change for sustainable urban mobility (2014) Comput.

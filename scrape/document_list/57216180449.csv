In this quantitative research, innovativeness is the exogenous variable, while the endogenous variables are perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and attitude towards using and behavioral intention. This research used primary data gathered from distributed questionnaires, directly from the millennial people in Indonesia. Using simple random sampling technique to total sample of 400 people out of the total population of 90 million people. Statistical analysis in this research is conducted using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Model (PLS–SEM). The result shows that innovativeness, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and attitude towards using the chatbot affected behavioral intention. © IAEME Publication.","Banking Industry; Chatbot; Millennial; Partial Least Square–Structural Equation Model (PLS–SEM); Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)",,,,,,"Aithal, P.S., Ideal banking concept and characteristics (2016) International Research Journal of Management, IT and Social Sciences (IRJMIS), 3 (11), pp. 46-55; Alharbi, S., Drew, S., Using the technology acceptance model in understanding academics’ behavioural intention to use learning management systems (2014) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 5 (1), pp. 143-155; Ashraf, A.R., Thongpapanl, N., Auh, S., The application of the technology acceptance model under different cultural contexts: The case of online shopping adoption (2014) Journal of International Marketing, 22 (3), pp. 68-93. , Tek), &; Bala, K., Kumar, M., Hulawale, S., Pandita, S., Chat-bot for college management system using AI (2017) International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology; Başgöze, P., Effects of brand credibility on technology acceptance model: Adaption of the model to the purchase intention (2012) International Journal of Humanities and Social Science, 2 (20), pp. 792-798. , Special – October; Rodrigues Pinho, C.M.J., Soares, A.M., Examining the technology acceptance model in the adoption of social networks (2011) Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 5 (2-3), pp. 116-129; Doğan, İ., (2018) The Application of Artificial Intelligence in New Age of Marketing An Analysis on AI Mobile Banking Apps, , Doctoral dissertation, İstanbul Bilgi Üniversitesi; Dole, A., Sansare, H., Harekar, R., Athalye, S., Intelligent chat bot for banking system (2015) International Journal of Emerging Trends & Technology in Computer Science, 4 (5), pp. 49-51; Eeuwen, M.V., (2017) Mobile Conversational Commerce: Messenger Chatbots as the Next Interface between Businesses and Consumers, , Master's thesis, University of Twente; Hung, S.Y., Chang, C.M., Kuo, S.R., User acceptance of mobile e-government services: An empirical study (2013) Government Information Quarterly, 30 (1), pp. 33-44; Jonsson, S., Bredmar, J., (2018) Chatbot-Magic in A Box?: A Study of A Chatbot in A Swedish Bank; Kim, S., Goh, J., Jun, S., The use of voice input to induce human communication with banking chatbots (2018) Companion of the 2018 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction ACM, pp. 151-152; Koul, S., Eydgahi, A., Utilizing Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for driverless car technology (2018) Journal of Technology Management & Innovation, 13 (4), pp. 37-46. , https://doi.org/10.4067/S0718-27242018000400037; Lai, P.C., The literature review of technology adoption models and theories for the novelty technology (2017) JISTEM-Journal of Information Systems and Technology Management, 14 (1), pp. 21-38; Chandra Sekaran, L., Balasubramanian, S., Website based patent information searching mechanism (2011) International Journal of Computer Engineering & Technology (IJCET), 1 (2), pp. 180-191; Lau, T., Leimer, B., The era of connectedness: How AI will help deliver the future of banking (2019) Journal of Digital Banking, 3 (3), pp. 215-231; Letheren, K., Dootson, P., Banking with a chatbot: A Battle between convenience and security (2017) The Conversation; Lorenzo, C.M., Lezcano, L., Alonso, S.S., Language learning in educational virtual worlds-a TAM based assessment (2013) J.

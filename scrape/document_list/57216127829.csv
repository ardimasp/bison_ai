Traditional Batak Toba House Architecture is a vernacular architecture that grows and develops from the local wisdom of ethnic communities and anchors on tradition, and is built by craftsmen based on experience (trial and error), using local techniques and materials and is an answer to the environmental settings where the building is located and always open to transformation. When building a Batak Toba traditional house, local people still understand the natural environment around the ecosystem. But in its current development, Batak Toba traditional community homes have undergone many changes, both in the form, space and use of ornaments and building materials. As a step so that the traditions of local wisdom are not extinct, it is necessary to preserve and apply the traditional forms and ornaments to the architecture of the Catholic Church as an effort to sustain the traditional architecture. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Batak Toba; Preserve; Sustain; Traditional house","Houses; Batak Toba; Ethnic community; Natural environments; Preserve; Sustain; Traditional architecture; Traditional house; Vernacular architecture; Architecture",,,,,"Mangunwijaya, Y.B., (2013) Wastu Citra; Wiranto, Arsitektur Vernakular Indonesia: Perannya Dalam Pengembangan Diri (1999) Jurnal Dimensi Teknik Arsitektur, 27, pp. 15-20; (2019) Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia, , KBBI; Roberts, C., (2013) Design Thinking, Process and Methods Manual; Simamora, T., (1997) Rumah Batak Toba Usaha Inkulturasi; Napitupulu, D.S., (1997) Arsitektur Tradisional Daerah Sumatera Utara; Sumartono, (2017) Metode Penelitian Kualitatif.; Sitindjak, R., Studi Ikonologi Panofsky pada Arsitektur dan Interior Gereja Katolik Inkulturatif Pangururan (2011) Jurnal Desain Interior Dimensi Interior, 9, pp. 119-136; Saragih, D.A., Yulianto Pakpahan, R., Kajian Ornamen Gorga di Rumah Adat Batak Toba (2019) Jurnal Arsitektur Alur, 2, pp. 1-14; De, S., Pengenalan Motif Gorga Singa Singa menggunakan Teknik Sublime Printing (2018) Atrat, Visual Art and Design Journal, 6, pp. 1-12","Roesli, C.; Interior Design Department, Indonesia; email: croesli@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

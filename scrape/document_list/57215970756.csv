However, motivation and engagement related problems can arise when the gamification elements are not personalized to match the individual's needs. Therefore, this research proposes a Hybrid Learning Model that combines both Gamification and Personality Traits to increase academic achievement and motivation for students who are studying foreign languages online. The methodology for the Hybrid Learning Model includes three different stages: pre-play stage where the students' personalities are gathered using the Big Five Personality questionnaire, gameplay stage where students' dominant personalities are examined to create gamified learning systems based on the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model, and the post-play stage where the effectiveness of the Hybrid Learning Model is measured through a recall test to measure achievement and an ARCS motivation questionnaire to measure motivation using various statistical analysis. The Hybrid Learning Model is applied to a language learning web application named VocaManager and tested the Korean vocabulary skills of non-native students who were learning Korean at a local language center in Indonesia. Using SPSS software, the results showed that students who studied under the Hybrid Learning Model had a significant improvement in both their learning achievements and motivation. In addition, the research revealed a significant positive correlation between students' motivation and students' academic achievements. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

However, even though it a sustainable resource, many people considered Bamboo as outcast material for furniture because of its appearance. Evidently, the use of bamboo is often used to make simple tools with similar traditional designs for everyday life. The tradition of using bamboo was not further explored with respect to the ongoing development of creative design and function in the era of today's modern technology. In retrospect to the above issues, this study is aimed to introduce the used of bamboo for material furniture in disaster and remote areas in Indonesia to increases their quality of life. It uses a research by a method of collecting data through surveys, literature review, interviews and training to determine the types of bamboo used for material furniture in disaster and remote territories. The results of this study is intended to show that the use of bamboo can be further developed into furniture for disaster and remote territory to create higher values of the products and increase the quality of life. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Disasters; Creative design; Furniture design; Literature reviews; Modern technologies; Quality of life; Remote areas; Sustainable materials; Sustainable resources; Bamboo",,,,,"Sonjaya, J.A., (2014) Kumpulan Materi Pelatihan Bambu.

The ability of graduates can be seen from the results of treasure studies and the soft skills needed can be mapped. So far, the curriculum, and graduate competencies focus more on hard skills even though soft skills are also needed in doing a job. Therefore, this research was conducted to map the soft skills needed to do a job. Data collection was carried out from the input of 99 Chinese Literature graduates spread across three universities that have Chinese Literature study programs. From the input of the graduates, communication skills and teamwork are more needed in doing a job. Thus, policy makers are expected to consider a soft skill course that is beneficial for students in doing a job. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Students; Chinese literature; Communication skills; Data collection; Indonesia; Policy makers; Soft skills; Engineering education",,,,,"Ying, Y., Rusman, Ali, M., Evaluation of curriculum impact to Students internship: A case study in Chinese Department of Bina nusantara university, Indonesia (2018) ACM int'L.

Learning through a game is more fun and beneficial, as proven by some studies. Therefore, in foreign language learning, especially English, many mobile applications are developed and can be downloaded on android phones for free, such as Funland and Monkey Puzzles World Tour. Unfortunately, the application has not been developed based on the needs of Indonesian elementary school students. A game application, called PowPow has been developed to meet those needs in supporting Indonesian students learn English vocabulary. This game has three different themes: house, restaurant and outer space. In each theme, students are motivated to play each prompt question in 30 seconds to complete the game. This application is played by 35 elementary Indonesian students aged 7 to 12 years. After playing the game, it is found out all students agree that this game motivates them to learn English. © 2019 The Authors.

However, the real implementation of the slogan is still beyond expectation. The goals of this research are to trail university students’ attitude toward diversity based on their conceptual understanding of the national slogan, their daily exposure toward diversity, and to critically analyze their ambiguous attitudes toward diversity. The research was conducted in 10 universities all over Indonesia with 267 respondents from English Department students. The respondents were asked to write an instant poem on free diversity experience and answer a questionnaire distributed afterward. The result of the study has shown that despite the fact that most of the students have positive attitude toward diversity in their poem, with almost perfect conceptual understanding of the national slogan, most of them still have ambiguous attitude in a deeper level of their claim upon individual declaration as a (non)pluralist. It is suggested that restoration and transformation of perception on diversity through education, new acceptance of hybridity and redefined identity, by reimagining diversity as empowering, is essentially needed to change Indonesian diversity reality into unity and prosperity. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Ambiguity; Attitude; Diversity; Poem; University student",,,,,,"Akun, A., Andreani, W., (2015) Microaggression and Diversity, , Tracing Indonesian University Students’ Attitudes toward Pluralism through Metaphorical Creative Expressions, Unpublished paper; Anhaf, M.I., (2013) Contesting Morality: Youth Piety and Pluralism in Indonesia, , The Pluralism Knowledge Programme, Utrecht; Brett, R.L., Jones, A.R., (2005) Lyrical Ballads: Wordsworth and Coleridge, , Routledge, New York; Dieleman, M., Koning, J., Post, P., (2011) Chinese Indonesians and Regime Change, , Brill, Leiden; Drury, J., (2006), The Poetry Dictionary, Writer’s Digest Book, Ohio; Heryanto, A., (2014) Identity and Pleasure: The Politics of Indonesian Screen Culture, , NU Press, Singapore; Kenndy, X.J., Gioia, D., (2005) Literature: An Introduction to Fiction Poetry Drama, , Pearson-Longman, New York; Koning, J., (2007) East Asia, 24, p. 129; Mariani, N., Syamsyiatun, S., Banawiratma, J.B., (2013) IJIMS: Indonesian Journal of Islam and Muslim Societies, 3, p. 1; Fainsilber, L., Ortony, A., (1987) Metaphor and Symbolic Activity, 2, p. 239; Parvis, L., (2013) Understanding Cultural Diversity in Today’s Complex World, , Embrace Publications and Consulting, LLC, Minneapolis","Akun, A.; English Department, Indonesia",,,"American Scientific Publishers",,,,,19366612,,,,"English","Adv.

The long history of Dutch colonialism in the past and the popularity of English in the present day in Indonesia have caused the country to be an interesting object for the study of English teaching in post-colonialism discourse. The observation was done by distributing the questionnaires to the students to investigate their perception toward English language and how they create the dichotomy of non-native English teachers and native English teachers. The result of the observation shows that English language is seen as superior language by Indonesian students and native English teachers are more preferred and perceived as the only legitimate teacher to teach English in Indonesian school. Thus, it proves that colonial language ideology exists within the process of English Language Teaching in Indonesia. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","English language teaching; Language ideology; Native english teacher; Post-colonialism",,,,,,"Shin, H., Kubota, R., Post-colonialism and globalization in language education (2008) The Handbook of Educational Linguistics, pp. 206-219. , edited by B.

The research is an experimental teaching to seventy-two students of SMPN 127, Jakarta, Indonesia. The data are collected from a questionnaire and interview with the students after they are taught using the two teaching methods. The result of the study shows thirty-nine students prefer Situational Presentation, while other thirty-two students prefer Grammar Translation Method. Compared to Situational Presentation Method, Grammar Translation Method is preferred by students who have higher academic competence since the method is perceived as identical to serious learning styles. Moreover, the students do not seem familiar with Situational Presentation Method. The study concludes that both teaching methods are still needed in a language class. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

To be a solution, support for aspects of the facility must be fulfilled. This will affect the level of comfort and safety of passengers. This study was conducted to evaluate and propose improvements to the handgrip facilities provided by Transjakarta, where the handgrip is a tool for passengers who do not get a seat. The result shows that 52.47% of passengers had uncomfortable while standing and holding the handgrip for long period of time. The collection of data to support this research was conducted through questionnaires, observations, and direct measurements. This study focuses on ergonomics aspect as a basis for data processing facility as proposed improvement of Transjakarta handgrip facility. The result shows the number of handgrip facilities insufficient the number of Transjakarta passengers, so that became the basis for the proposed additional amount of handgrip facilities. In addition, the proposed improvements to the high-range handgrip on women carriages based on Anthropometric data, that is the average height of Indonesian women in 2016. © IEOM Society International.","Anthropometry; Ergonomics; Handgrip; Transjakarta",,,,,,"Decilya, F.S., Endri, (2010) Warga Jakarta Rugi Triliunan Rupiah Akibat Kemacetan, , http://www.tempointeractive.com/hg/jakarta/2010/06/brk,20100626-258627,id.html, Tempo Interactive.

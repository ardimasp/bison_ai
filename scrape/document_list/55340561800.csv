Cities will naturally attract people from different nationalities to live, study and work. The rapid development of cities has long been regarded as major drive of urbanization from other areas which contributed to the high level of ethnic and race diversities. However diversity is currently seen under threat due to the rise of global populism that is mainly fuelled by anxiety over economic condition. The growth of nationalist movement, anti-immigrant parties and xenophobia is gaining foothold across the planet. Against this backdrop, this paper aims at investigating the nexus between diversity and inequality in Jakarta. The current local election provides example of these two competing concepts. Jakarta as emerging global city with diverse communities had been marred by public protest and narration of identity issues. On the other hands, populism has deep root in severe economic inequality among the residents. A robust development in Jakarta has been marked by concentration of wealth in the hands of few. This paper presents case study on the root causes of growing populism and its relations with inequality in Jakarta. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Deep roots; Diverse community; Economic condition; Economic inequality; Global cities; Jakarta; Robust development; Root cause",,,,,"Muggah, R., Glenny, M., Populism is Poison, Plural Cities are the Antidotes (2017) World Economic Forum; Bank, W., (2015) Investing in Urban Resilience : Protecting and Promoting Resilience in A Changing World, , (World Bank); Setijadi, C., (2017) Ahok Downfall and the Rise of Islamist Populism in Indonesia, , (ISEAS: Singapore); Harrison, P., Bobbins, K., (2014) Urban Resilience Thinking for Municipalities, , (Johannesburg); Folke, C., Resilience: The emergence of a perspective for social-ecologicalsystems analyses (2006) Global Environmental Change, 16 (3), pp. 253-267; Pickett, S.T.A., Cadenasso, M., McGrath, B., (2013) Resilience in Ecology and Urban Design: Linking Theory Andpractice for Sustainable Cities, 3. , (Dordrecht, Netherlands: Springer) in S T Pickett, M Cadenasso and B McGrath eds; Leichenko, R., Climate change and urban resilience (2011) Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 3 (3), pp. 164-168. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2010.12.014; Zimmerman, R., Faris, C., Climate change mitigation and adaptation in North American cities (2011) Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 3 (3), pp. 181-187; UN-Habitat's City Resilience Profiling Programme (CRPP), , http://cityresilience.org/CRPP; ICLEI Resilience City Series, , http://resilient-cities.iclei.org/http://resilient-; 100 Resilient Cities, , http://www.100resilientcities.org/; Meerow, S., Newell, J., Stults, M., Landscape and Urban Planning, 147, pp. 38-49; (2015) City Resilience Framework, , Rockefeller Foundation; Wilson, I., (2017) Jakarta : Inequality and the Poverty of Elite Pluralism, , http://www.newmandala.org/jakarta-inequality-poverty-elite-pluralism/, (New Mandala); Tempo Penyebab Ahok Kalah Versi Dua Peneliti, , https://pilkada.tempo.co/read/news/2017/04/23/348868728/penyebab-ahok-kalah-versi-dua-peneliti-australia, Australia (23 April 2017) [Accessed July 25, 2017); 100 Resilient Cities, , http://www.100resilientcities.org/; A Setyadi Ini 9 Program Unggulan Jokowi-Ahok 2013-2017, , http://news.okezone.com/read/2013/02/05/500/756846/ini-9-program-unggulanjokowi-tahun-2013-2017, (Okezone, 5 Februari 2013) [Accessed July 30, 2017]; 100 Resilient Cities Jakarta's Resilience Challenge (N.d), , http://www.100resilientcities.org/cities/jakarta/; A Oswald Jakarta, Resilient City, , http://www.academia.edu/26872859/Jakarta_Resilient_City, [Accessed July 17,2017); http://wartaekonomi.co.id/read/2014/11/07/37618/nah-ini-dia-13-program-unggulan-pemprov-dki-2015.html, Warta Ekonomi Nah Ini Dia 13 Program Unggulan Pemprov DKI 2015 (7 November 2014) [Accessed August 1, 2017); Sindonews Bangun RPTRA, Pemda DKI Terbantu CSR Perusahaan, , https://metro.sindonews.com/read/1072985/171/bangun-rptra-dki-terbantu-csrperusahaan-1451367463, (9 Desember 2015) [Accessed August 1, 2017); Merdeka Djarot Beber Alasan Tak Cantumkan Program Penciptaan Lapangan Kerja, , https://www.merdeka.com/politik/djarot-beber-alasan-takcantumkan-program-penciptaan-lapangan-kerja.html, (22 September 2016) [Accessed July 30,2017]; Kompas DKI Tetapkan Seragam Betawi Untuk Siswa, , http://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2014/08/08/08404301/DKI.Terapkan.Seragam.Betawi.untuk.Siswa, (8 Agustus 2014) Accesed July 31.2017]",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","4th International Conference on Friendly City 2017","11 October 2017 through 12 October 2017",,135340,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Ninety-six in-depth interviews and 23 focus group discussions were used to document child protection threats and local means of support. The research identified domestic violence, early marriage, school dropout, child labor and violent teachers as key communal concerns. In exploring referral pathways, it was learned that protection concerns are primarily kept secret, addressed within the family, or shared with friends, and that national and regional child protection legislation is viewed as in tension with local values. The study identifies a number of challenges that must be addressed if better linkages between local and national child welfare policies are to be established. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","child protection; community-based child protection mechanisms; Indonesia; national child protection systems",,,,,,"Ahmad, R.G., Susanti, B., Amalia, C., Damayana, G.P., Hak anak di Indonesia: Hukum, kebeijakan dan prakteknya [Research report on the rights of the child in Indonesia: Law, policy and practice], , Jakarta: Center for Law & Policy Studies Indonesia (Peta Hukum Indonesia, PSHK) and UNICEF; http://www.bappenas.go.id/get-file-server/node/10836/, BAPPENAS (Indonesian Ministry of Planning).

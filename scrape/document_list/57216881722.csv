One of those is the concept of a smart city, where architects are racing to design the most functional and aesthetically pleasing buildings. This circumstance poses a threat where bigger buildings, means a bigger chance of people getting lost inside a building. Unlike outdoors where we got GPS to help locate our position in this world. Inside a building GPS signals tend to be heavily interfered, thus making it unreliable. This paper proposes cloud-based indoor positioning service, that can be implemented for indoor navigation system. The service uses an android device to pick up the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and send it to the server to transform it from (X, Y) points obtained by fingerprinting techniques into a global coordinate based on 2D-to-2D transformation matrix. We used 21 x 10 meters of room for the testing. The result suggest that this kind of technique is doable, and it reports good availability with the trade-off of response time and throughput at higher request counts. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

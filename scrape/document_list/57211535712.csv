UIN Suska Riau has a technical executing unit called PTIPD. This unit aims to manage all the academic data. PTIPD develops a kind of academic information system namely IRaise. It is necessary to use tools for data integration, in this case IRaise and feeder, to ease the academic data reporting. A solution to this problem is developing application by using we service technology. The aim of this research is to actualizes a web service plan that is able to integrate data between academic information system of UIN Suska Riau and PDDIKTI feeder, by using SOA approach. The development method with Service Lifecycle. The development of web service-based application with 10 modules by 12 methods becomes the result of this research. This web service-based application will be implemented in UIN Suska Riau and be tested by using blackbox method and performance test. Also, the developed web service-based application produces a proper, effective, efficient integration service that complies with the need of academic data reporting. © International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

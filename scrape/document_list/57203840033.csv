Nevertheless, the mistakenness in the fulfillment of nutrition still concerned. It happens because an individual does not have much knowledge about the energy content of food and food combination to meet the nutrition requirement. The objectives of this research are to facilitate an individual to obtain the optimum nutrition intake from their daily dietary habit. This paper proposes a Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) algorithm to find the optimum combination of food portion and food option for an individual daily dietary habit. The food data is obtained from 'Tabel Komposisi Pangan Indonesia' book which contains more than 1600 kind of Indonesian food. The results show that BPSO provides an optimum nutrition intake accuracy of 99.14%. Moreover, the nutritionist is already validated that this experiment is succeed in recommending a variation of daily dietary habit that meet an optimum nutrition intake for an individual. Based on this result it can be conducted that BPSO can provide the better accuracy of optimum nutrition intake than Genetic Algorithm (GA), while GA can only provide an optimum nutrition intake accuracy of 97.87%. © 2019 The Authors.

In general, modifying the existing algorithm by assuming that the training data is imbalanced, is the only way to handle imbalance data. However, for a normal data handling, this way mostly produces a deficient result. In this research, we propose a class expert generative adversarial network (CE-GAN) as the solution for imbalance data classification. CE-GAN is a modification in deep learning algorithm architecture that does not have an assumption that the training data is imbalance data. Moreover, CE-GAN is designed to identify more detail about the character of each class before classification step. CE-GAN has been proved in this research to give a good performance for imbalance data classification. © 2018 The Authors.

However, this method leads to some problems, like a difficulty of moving a traveler to a proper position (perspective) and an inhibition of work due to damaged control panel. In this research, a model of a web-based application to control a traveler with spans by using Raspberry Pi is developed. This research's contribution is a model of a web-based application for traveler automation in all possible movements of its components. As the results, the experiments show that the program implemented doesn't take much time and the execution of a command is done in a reasonable time. Moreover, for the safety of the bridge traveler, this program also implements a sensor that works when a component is at its most downward/inward position and detecting a blocking object in the middle of a possible movement and stops the movement immediately. © 2018 The Authors.

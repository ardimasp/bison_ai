The results of the analysis tell that there is a need for an accounting information system for revenue cycle that can integrate company’s business process, so that all transaction data can be found and stored properly. As this accounting information system is created, it is expected to reduce problems such as data lost and the risk of fraud due to creating documents manually. The method that is use based on the problems that have been found to a business process design is created by using Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) which is illustrated through the Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram notation. The proposed of the business process design provides solutions to the problems in revenue cycle by creating a system that includes cash and credit sales, return of goods, and making reports that can work quickly and accurately to improve the performance with the integrated systems. © 2020 SERSC.","Accounting Information Systems; Analysis; Design; Revenue Cycle",,,,,,"Burmaoglu, S., Sartenaer, O., Porter, A., Conceptual definition of technology emergence: A long journey from philosophy of science to science policy (2019) Technology in Society, 1; Ranjith, V.K., Business Models and Competitive Advantage (2016) Procedia Economics and Finance, 37, pp. 203-207; Budiansyah, O., Safitricherrya, Y., Pengaruh Perputaran Kas, Perputaran Piutang, dan Perputaran Persediaan Terhadap Profitabilitas (2016) Jurnal Skripsi, pp. 1-3; Berisha-Shaqiri, A., Impact of Information Technology and Internet in Businesses (2015) Cademic Journal of Business, Administration, Law and Social Sciences, pp. 73-79; Amanamah, R.B., Morrison, A., Asiedu, K., Computerized Accounting Systems Usage by Small and Medium Scale Enterprises in Kumasi Metropolis, Ghana (2016) Research Journal of Finance and Accounting, 7 (16); Australia, C., Harnessing digital technology, keeping the customer in focus (2017) The Fintech Advantage, 13; Fagbemi, T.O., Olaoye, J.A., An Evaluation Of Accounting Information System And Performance Of Small Scale Enterprises In Kwara State, Nigeria (2016) DBA Africa Management Review, 1; Patel, B.P., Effects of accounting information system on Organizational Profitability (2015) Swami Sahajanand College of Commerce and Management, 72; Ranjith, V.K., Business Models and Competitive Advantage (2016) Procedia Economics and Finance, 37, pp. 203-207; Accounting Information Systems and how to prepare for Digital Transformation (2017) The Routledge Companion to Accounting Information Systems, p. 12. , Rehm; Romney, M.B., Steinbart, P.J., (2018) Accounting Information Systems 14E, , Pearson; Satzinger, J.W., Jackson, R.B., Burd, S.D., (2016) Systems Analysis and Design","Noerlina; Information Systems Department, Indonesia; email: nurlina@binus.edu",,,"Science and Engineering Research Support Society",,,,,20054238,,,,"English","Int.

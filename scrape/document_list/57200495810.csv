To help combat the situation globally, educators must develop and utilize effective sales ethics pedagogies. The first step involves understanding cross-cultural sales ethics perspectives. A convenience sample is drawn from five countries (United States, France, Germany, Indonesia, and New Zealand), and the Personal Selling Ethics Scale (PSE-2) is successfully used to examine culturally specific and gender-based evaluation differences. Gender-based ethical perspectives are of particular interest due to the growing gender diversity within sales professions. The study finds that cultural traditionalism/secularism and individualism/collectivism affect sales ethics evaluations. Likewise, gender and moral ideology affect evaluations. Women are more sensitive to ethical misconduct than men, and absolutist are more sensitive than exceptionists, situationists, and subjectivists. Specific pedagogical recommendations are provided. © The Author(s) 2018.","cross-cultural ethics evaluations; ethics pedagogy; gender evaluation differences; modernization theory; moral ideology; Personal Selling Ethics Scale; traditionalism and individualism",,,,,,"Alas, R., Ethics in countries with different cultural dimensions (2006) Journal of Business Ethics, 69, pp. 237-247; Allen, C., Kumar, P., Tarasi, C., Wilson, H., Selling sales: Factors influencing undergraduate business students’ decision to pursue sales education (2014) Journal of Marketing Education, 36, pp. 94-104; Baker, W.E., (1999) North star falling: The American crisis of values and the new millennium, , School of Business, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Unpublished manuscript; Baldauf, A., Lee, N., International selling and sales management: Sales force research beyond geographic boundaries (2011) Journal of Personal Selling & Sales Management, 31, pp. 211-217; Barnett, T., Bass, K., Brown, G., Ethical ideology and ethical judgment regarding ethical issues in business (1994) Journal of Business Ethics, 13, pp. 469-480; Barnett, T., Bass, K., Brown, G., Religiosity, ethical ideology, and intentions to report a peer’s wrongdoing (1996) Journal of Business Ethics, 15, pp. 1161-1174; Barnett, T., Bass, K., Brown, G., Herbert, F.J., Ethical ideology and the ethical judgments of marketing professionals (1998) Journal of Business Ethics, 17, pp. 715-723; Beu, D.S., Buckley, M.R., Harvey, M.G., Ethical decision-making: A multidimensional construct (2003) Business Ethics: A European Review, 12, pp. 88-106; Buller, P.F., Anderson, K.S., The challenge of global ethics (1991) Journal of Business Ethics, 10, pp. 767-775; (2015) Employed persons by detailed occupation, sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, , http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm, Retrieved from; Castleberry, S., Salesperson ethics: An interactive computer simulation (2014) Journal of Marketing Education, 36, pp. 209-216; Collins, D., The quest to improve the human condition: The first 1,500 articles published in Journal of Business Ethics (2000) Journal of Business Ethics, 26 (1), pp. 1-73; Cummins, S., Peltier, J.W., Erffmeyer, R., Whalen, J., A critical review of the literature for sales educators (2013) Journal of Marketing Education, 35, pp. 68-78; Dabholkar, P.A., Kellaris, J.J., Toward understanding marketing students’ ethical judgment of controversial personal selling practices (1992) Journal of Business Research, 24, pp. 313-329; Dobson, J., White, J., Toward the feminine firm: An extension to Thomas White (1995) Business Ethics Quarterly, 5, pp. 463-478; Donoho, C.L., Heinze, T.C., The Personal Selling Ethics Scale: Replication and expansion for the teaching of sales ethics (2011) Journal of Marketing Education, 33, pp. 107-122; Donoho, C.L., Heinze, T.C., Kondo, C., Gender differences in personal selling ethics evaluations: Do they exist and what does their existence mean for teaching sales ethics?

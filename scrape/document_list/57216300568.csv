The purpose of making this paper is to discuss the application of mail handling system named Simaya which is used by the Ministry of Communication and Informatics (KOMINFO). In addition, this application can improve the efficiency of users in accessing the system and provide users in receiving and facilitate information quickly and can be accessed anywhere and anytime. The research method used to analyze all the requirements needed in making mobile applications, namely testing systems, conducting analysis and experiments on features that have been available on web-based simaya systems that have previously been used by KOMINFO. In designing the mobile applications based on requirements that have been collected previously, literature studies look for sources related to this paper through journals, books, articles, and e-books. Axure RP8 is the tools that used in designing the user interface (UI) of the system. Simaya Mobile is expected to be able to help employees more optimally in making agreements. New features designed to make it easier for users to communicate with other users directly. The main features found in the simaya mobile dashboard present a user-friendly feature. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

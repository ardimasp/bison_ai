Personal health is obtained by maintaining regular diet and exercise. However, because of the lack of public knowledge about balanced food intake and calorie requirements for daily activities, it is difficult for the community to determine the amount of calories consumed and burned. The author proposes the concept of a system that integrates Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)-based gym and logistics to solve this problem. This research methodology uses a systematic literature review. The results of this study are the big picture of service-based architecture which consists of nine layers, namely profile, order, catalog, payment, shipping, chat, diary, promotion and gym inventory. © 2019 IEEE.","Calorie Control Application; integration; Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)","Computer architecture; Information services; Integration; Nutrition; Control applications; Daily activity; Food intake; Personal health; Public knowledge; Research methodologies; Service-based; Systematic literature review; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,"(2015) Hanya 27% Penduduk Indonesia Rutin Berolahraga, , https://databoks.katadata.co.id/datapublish/2016/11/10/hanya-27-penduduk-Indonesia-rutin-berolahraga, Badan Pusat Statistik BPS.

Society is one reason that catering services are needed. The need to order catering has increased to become an opportunity in the food service business. But in practice, it is difficult to find information about the catering that is needed information or marketing from the seller of the service that is felt lacking. The purpose of this study is to design e-commerce applications for catering businesses based on service-oriented architecture (SOA) so that they can integrate several service selling entities and help people find easier food service. The benefit of this research is finding an e-commerce application design for the catering business, can get catering information more easily and can make catering reservations easier. The method used in this research is observation on the respondent who are a catering consumer and business canvas model from the observation. The results of this study are SWOT Analysis, Business Model Canvas, and the design of e-commerce prototypes for catering businesses that can be used in catering industry which will going to e-commerce industry. © BEIESP.","Catering; E-commerce; Service-oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,,"(2015) Jumlah Penduduk dan Rasio Jenis Kelamin Menurut Kabupaten/Kota di Provinsi DKI Jakarta; Radovilsky, Z., (2015) Designing and Implementing an E-Commerce System, , Bus.

For the Thousand Islands area, educational facilities are quite adequate, but the problem is that if you want to continue your education at the upper secondary level, students must stay on Pramuka Island, and incur additional costs. With the development of information systems and technology, making the industrial era 4.0 grow rapidly, so that and bring changes to the education sector with e-learning terminology that can provide solutions for regions in Indonesia that are still constrained in problems of access and distance so it is necessary to know the level of teacher readiness and students in schools in the Pramuka Island environment in the Thousand Islands in utilizing electronic learning. Quantitative research approaches are used and data collection uses a questionnaire with a likert scale with a population of all teachers and all school students who are on Pramuka Island, Thousand Islands. The research method uses the factor analysis method and the regression analysis method is used to build the model.

In the traditional project paradigm, most projects are managed using a lot of manual documents that require a relatively need much time while the field team is faced with technical work that is not possible to do manual documentation. Project management plays a role from initiation, planning, supervision and control and closure in a project life cycle. To be able to carry out all project life cycles and make decisions requires complete documentation, however, the project team is often faced with the choice of whether doing documented or doing the project. Project Management Information Systems (PMIS) are a project management tool that can assist the project team in planning, scheduling, monitoring and reporting automatically throughout the project management process. Several IS/IT project uses PMIS to help their project management, with the aim to be more effective. Then, the project will be successful in the process.

Conversely, the success or failure of the project itself is usually measured based on business profitability which is calculated based on a fixed budget and a tight schedule. From the research that has been done and related to several previous papers. The findings show that 87 respondents had experienced problems in information systems projects, of which 70% felt that the level of completion of information systems projects carried out was at the middle level. Mostly, respondents agreed that the statement conveyed as the cause was over-budget and over-schedule. Based on the Project Management Body Of Knowledge (PMBOK) and through the approach using factor analysis methods and regression analysis for the formation of models on a number of influential variables, 6 (six) factors were obtained causing information system project failure, namely absence of sympathetic leadership, ignorance of costs, neglected latent risks, schedule tolerance, psychology becomes failed, and ineffective communication, and the main variables indicate that leadership factors are the main cause of information system project success or failure in software implementation. © 2019 IEEE.","failure factor; IS project; PMBOK; software","Budget control; Computer software; Factor analysis; Failure (mechanical); Information systems; Information use; Project management; Regression analysis; Risk assessment; Engineering process; Factor analysis method; Failure factors; Fixed budget; Information system projects; PMBOK; Project Management Body of Knowledge; Software implementation; Information management",,,,,,"Verma, S., Sekhar Bhattacharyya, S., Kumar, S., An extension of the technology acceptance model in the big data analytics system implementation environ-ment (2018) Information Processing & Manage-ment, 54 (5), pp. 791-806. , September 2018; Xiong, H., Payne, D., Kinsella, S., Peer effects in the diffusion of innovations: Theory and simulation (2016) Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Economics, 63, pp. 1-13. , August 2016; Mishra, D., Akman, I., Mishra, A., Theory of reasoned action application for green information technology acceptance (2014) Computers in Human Behavior, 36. , July 2014, 40; Keil, M., Mann, J., Rai, A., Why software projects escalate: An empirical analysis and test of four theoretical models (2000) MIS Quarterly, 24 (4), pp. 631-664; Ferreira, J., Coelho, A., Moutinho, L., (2018) Dynamic Capabilities, Creativity and Innovation Capability and Their Impact on Competitive Advantage and Firm Performance: The Moderating Role of Entrepreneurial Orientation, , Technovation, In press, corrected proof, online 12 December 2018; David, F.R., (2011) Strategic Management: Concepts and Cases, , Business & Economics Strategic Planning.

One way to survive and improve its performance is through the management of information, it is necessary to be able to see and assess the company from a variety of perspectives. One of the keys to surviving and playing a role is to manage complete, fast and precise information. Data analysis will be easy if the required data is available. Business intelligence techniques (BI) can be used to assist in the decision-making process. Many organization and educational institution have implemented BI as the support system. Therefore, we make a comparison study about BI research finding from several articles. From the comparison study it can be seen the research in the BI field is continues to grow and also following the technology trend. This can be seen from the topics discussed in the journal articles in the period 2010-2017. This study is conducted to see the spread and trend of business intelligence research in various forms of organization. Also can be seen the advantages of BI in the decision-making process. © 2019 IEEE.","Business Intelligence; decision-making; review","Competition; Information analysis; Business competition; Comparison study; Decision making process; Educational institutions; Journal articles; Strategic decision making; Support systems; Technology trends; Decision making",,,,,,"Turban, E., Aronson, J.E., Liang, T., (2007) Decision Support Systems and, , 7th ed.

The interval width of forecasting is one of data values to assist in the selection decision making process in regards to crime prevention. However, in time series forecasting, especially the use of ARIMA model, the amount of historical data available can affect forecasting result including interval width forecasting value. This study proposes a combination technique, in order to get get a better interval width crime forecasting value. The propose combination technique between ARIMA model and Fuzzy Alpha Cut are presented. The use of variation alpha values are used, they are 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7. The experimental results have shown the use of ARIMA-FAC with alpha=0.5 is appropriate. The overall results obtained have shown the interval width crime forecasting with ARIMA-FAC is better than interval width crime forecasting with 95% CI ARIMA model. © 2019 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","ARIMA; Decision; FAC; Forecasting; Interval width",,,,,,,"Sadikin, M.P., The Implementation of E-learning System Governance to Deal with User Need, Institution Objective, and Regulation Compliance (2018) TELKOMNIKA Telecommunication Computing Electronics and Control, 16 (3), pp. 1332-1344; Adriansyah, A., Enhanced Neuro-Fuzzy Architecture for Electrical Load Forecasting (2010) TELKOMNIKA Telecommunication Computing Electronics and Control, 8 (2), pp. 97-106; Waddell, D., Sohal, A.S., Forecasting: The Key to Managerial Decision Making (1994) Management Decision, 32, pp. 41-49; Kim, J., Bootstrap-after-bootstrap prediction intervals for autoregressive models (2001) Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, 19 (1), pp. 117-128; Hansen, B.E., Interval forecasts and parameter uncertainty (2006) Journal of Econometrics, 135, pp. 377-398; Khosravi, A., Nahavandi, S., Creighton, D., A neural network-GARCH-based method for construction of Prediction Intervals (2013) Electric Power Systems Research, 96, pp. 185-193; Pielke, R.A., Jr., The role of models in prediction for decision.

The congestion negatively affects not only to economy and physiology factors, but also for human environment and health. This paper methodologically represents the development of ecological decision support system based on the concept of fuzzy logic (Fuzzy ecoDSS) for RTE. Three types of core method operated here; fuzzy logic, water flow algorithm (WFA), and object oriented. The method fuzzy logic used to avoid the fuzziness in parameterizing and prioritize the parameters. The WFA approach functioned to replicate the flow of road traffic and optimize it thru RTE. Finally, the method object oriented benefited to analyze and design the constructed system. Thus, the simulation result exhibits the best decision alternative taken gives better air condition (more 200% than normal condition) and better road traffic velocity (more 2,200% than normal situation). © 2018 IEEE.","decision support system; ecology; fuzzy logic; road traffic congestion; road traffic engineering; system development; water flow diagram","Air; Artificial intelligence; Computer circuits; Decision support systems; Ecology; Flow of water; Fuzzy logic; Highway administration; Highway engineering; Hydraulics; Information management; Roads and streets; Human environment; Normal condition; Object oriented; Parameterizing; Road traffic; System development; Water flow algorithms; Water flows; Traffic congestion",,,,,,"Utama, D.N., Zaki, F.A., Munjeri, I.J., Putri, N., Fwfa optimization based decision support system for road traffic engineering (2017) Journal of Physics Conference Series, 801 (1); Bao, Y., Xiao, F., Gao, Z., Gao, Z., Investigation of the traffic congestion during public holiday and the impact of the toll-exemption policy (2017) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 104, pp. 58-81; D.

Processing of data into useful information is indispensable. Crime trend prediction is helpful to make a decision in crime prevention activities. Other than that, law enforcement authority needs several decision options based on crime trend prediction. It is needed because prediction may contain an uncertainty. To obtain that needed a decision making system application is required. This paper presented a proposed decision making system application that can provide information about crime prevention decision options. The decision options are made based on crime forecasting and interval forecasting data. Every selection of each decision option is based on the level of crime forecasting limit range and crime forecasting values. To classify the limit range, then the distribution frequency is used. There is a high level, medium level and low level. Then, a decision options are made based on this level. The if-then rules are used for decision selection processes. The decision result in several probably conditions hopefully can help law enforcement authority for making better crime prevention decision. The system application for this process is named Crime Prevention Decision Support System (CreP-DSS). © 2016 IEEE.","CreP-DSS; crime prevention; distribution frequency","Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Decision making; Decision support systems; Forecasting; Law enforcement; CreP-DSS; Crime Prevention; Decision selection; Decision-making systems; distribution frequency; Enforcement authorities; Interval forecasting; System applications; Crime",,,,,,"Ahmad, S., Simonovic, S.P., An intelligent decision support system for management of floods (2006) Water Resources Management, 20, pp. 391-410; Antonopoulou, E., Karetsos, S.T., Maliappis, M., Sideridis, A.B., Web and mobile technologies in a prototype DSS for major field crops (2010) Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 70, pp. 292-301; Bhargava, H.K., Power, D.J., Decision support systems and web technologies : A status report (2001) Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS).; Büyüközkan, G., Feyzoglu, O., A fuzzy-logic-based decisionmaking approach for new product development (2004) International Journal of Production Economics, 90, pp. 27-45; Chang, N.-B., Pongsanone, N.P., Ernest, A., A rule-based decision support system for sensor deployment in small drinking water networks (2013) Journal of Cleaner Production, 60, pp. 152-162; Cohen, J., Gorr, W.L., (2005) Development of Crime Forecasting and Mapping Systems for Use by Police, , H.

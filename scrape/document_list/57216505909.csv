The paper presents the gap between the experience of the post millennial generation and their expectation in learning English; as well as the lecturers' experience and perspective regarding the use of technology in learning a language. The data were gathered by distributing questionnaires to 247 university students investigating their generations, their expectation, and experience in learning English. The information from the lecturers was obtained by interviewing 10 lecturers from various generations. The results show that the score of students' experience regarding the use of technology is lower than those of their expectation. In their experience, technology has been implemented to obtain materials from website and to communicate with lecturers using Whattsap/facebook/Line. However, the highest score of students' expectation indicates that technology should be provided as campus facilities and be used to communicate with lecturers. The lecturers have applied technology to obtain supplementary materials and to initiate online games, also they expect to use various language application in teaching. The results of the research can function as the input in developing the teaching of English using technology. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Students; Surveys; Information communication and technology; Learning English; On-line games; University students; Engineering education",,,,"Binus University","We would like to thank Bina Nusantara University in supporting us financially, especially for the Library and Knowledge Center in assisting us in finding the resources, as well as the Research and Technology Transfer Office research in guiding us to conduct this research.

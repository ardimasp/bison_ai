The most important asset in a company is its employees. However, it is increasingly difficult for HR professionals to acquire and maintain the required talents. To solve this issue, organizations are starting to use gamification. Gamification is a design process where elements or mechanics in gaming are added to a non-game application or system. Compared to the standard recruitment, gamified recruitment has several advantages such as: 1) identify motivated candidates, 2) evaluate people without much experience more easily, 3) evaluate people who have diverse experience, and 4) engage the candidate. By using Marczewski’s gamification framework, we provide a theory-based guide on how to implement gamification in employee recruitment using a simple gamification framework. Though this proposed idea has not yet been tested, we believe that this idea is feasible in real life application. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Customers are very active in assessing various businesses that exist through various ways, including through social media. Seeing this phenomenon many companies have begun using social media to reach their customers. A connection with customers through social media must be supported by Social CRM. Social CRM is a business strategy to engage customers through social media by building their trust and loyalty. There is one company in Indonesia that is good in the application of CRM, namely PT. Gojek Indonesia. Gojek is a startup company which became the first startup in Indonesia that holds decacorn status. Gojek has made Twitter as a platform for social CRM. Application of social CRM is not that easy. Customers will be free to criticize and vent their emotions through social media. In this case, writers are interesting to find out the factors that are the strength of Gojek in carrying out Social CRM activities through social media Twitter. This research uses factor analysis techniques. The population used in this study are @GojekIndonesia’s Twitter followers. The results showed that there are 2 new components that make up social CRM at PT. Gojek Indonesia. The first factor is the ""customer hearing"" which represents the factors of listening, embracing, greetings and responses. The second factor is ""Serving Customer"" which represents supporting, energizing and talking factors. Based on the loading factors, the main strength of PT. Gojek Indonesia in applying social CRM, is ""Greetings"". This shows that PT. Gojek Indonesia gives good Greetings to customers to make customers comfortable in communicating through social media. Then the other main strength of PT. Gojek Indonesia is ""Supporting"". This shows that PT. Gojek Indonesia routinely provides services to customers through social media so that they can be good in social CRM. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS","Customer Relationship Management; Factor Analysis; Social CRM; Twitter",,,,,,,"Alrubaiee, L., Exploring the relationship between ethical sales behavior, relationship quality, and customer loyalty (2012) International Journal of Marketing Studies, 4; Bonacchi, M., Perego, P., Improving profitability with customer-centric strategies: The case of a mobile content provider (2011) Strategic Change, 20 (7-8), pp. 253-267; Onacchi, M., Perego, P., Improving profitability with customer-centric strategies: The case of a mobile content provider (2011) Strategic Change, 20 (7-8), pp. 253-267. , https://doi.org/10.1002/jsc.899; Elena, C.A., Social media – A strategy in developing customer relationship management (2016) Procedia Economics and Finance, 39, pp. 785-790. , https://doi.org/10.1016/s2212-5671(16)30266-0, November 2015; Fauzi, A.D., Harli, E., Rancang Bangun Sistem Informasi Akademik Berbasis SMS Gateway dengan Metode Rapid Application Development (2017) University Research Colloquium (URECOL), pp. 81-86. , Hal; Grizane, T., Jurgelane, I., Social media impact on business evaluation (2016) Procedia Computer Science, 104, pp. 190-196. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2017.01.103, December 2016; Hasibuan, M., (2012) Manajemen Sumber Daya Manusia, , Jakarta: PT Bumi.

In personality prediction areas the use of Stacking as learning algorithm has the best performance compared other learning algorithms. Stacking has a structure consisting of two-level learners making it possible to use several different classifiers to improve the performance of system. However, Stacking has weakness. It performs worse in multi-class dataset than two class datasets. Previous study has shown that adding level learners in the original Stacking structure can improve the performance of system in either multi-class or two class datasets. This study proposes a method called Modified Stacking, which adds one level learner in the original Stacking structure so that it becomes three level learners and adds grammatical features to improve the performance of Personality prediction system. The evaluation results using 10-Fold cross validation indicate that the system obtained average prediction accuracy of 99.62% for Modified Stacking and 99.24% for Stacking. It can be concluded that Modified Stacking has better performance in terms of accuracy than Stacking. In addition, the additions of level learners and grammatical features have an effect to improve accuracy. However, the execution time increased significantly over the addition of level learner in the Stacking structure. © 2020 SERSC.","Ensemble Learning; Modified Stacking; Neural Networks; Stacking",,,,,,,"(2019) Number of Monthly Active Twitter Users Worldwide from 1St Quarter 2010 to 1St Quarter 2019 (In Millions), , https://www.statissta.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/, Statistika.com; Carley, K.M., Malik, M., Kowalchuk, M., Twitter usage in Indonesia (2015) Research Gate; Qiu, L., Lin, H., Ramsay, J., Yang, F., You are what you tweet: Personality expression and perception on Twitter (2012) Journal of Research in Personality, 46, pp. 710-718; Pratama, B.Y., Sarno, R., Personality Classification Based on Twitter Text Using Naive Bayes, KNN and SVM (2015) International Conference on Data and Software Engineering; Rumagit, R.Y., Girsang, A.S., Predicting Personality Traits of Facebook Users using Text Mining (2018) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology; Ong, V., Rahmanto, A.D.S., Williem, D.S., Nugroho, A.E., Andangsari, E.W., Suprayogi, M.N., Personality Prediction Based on Twitter Information in Bahasa Indonesia (2017) Proceedings of the Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, pp. 367-372; Adi, G.Y.N., Tandio, M.H., Ong, V., Suhartono, D., Optimization for Automatic Personality Recognition on Twitter in Bahasa Indonesia (2018) Elsevier Ltd; Mairesse, F., Walker, M.A., Mehl, M.R., Moore, R.K., Using Linguistic Cues for the Automatic Recognition of Personality in Conversation and Text (2007) Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 30, pp. 457-500; Lima, A.C.E., De Castro, L.N., A multi-label, semi-supervised classification approach applied to personality prediction in social media (2014) Affective Neural Networks and Cognitive Learning Systems for Big Data, 58, pp. 122-130; Wolpert, D.H., Stacked Generalization (1992) Neural Networks, 5, pp. 241-259; Seewald, A.K., (2003) Towards Understanding Stacking-Studies of a General Ensemble Learning Scheme, , TU Wien: PhD-Thesis; Menahem, E., Rokach, L., Elovici, Y., Troika-An improved stacking schema for classification tasks (2009) Information Sciences, 179, pp. 4097-4122; Zitlau, R., Hoyle, B., Paech, K., Weller, J., Rau, M.M., Seitz, S., Stacking for machine learning redshifts applied to SDSS galaxies (2016) MNRAS, 460, pp. 3152-3162; Ramdhani, N., Adaptasi Bahasa dan Budaya Inventori Big Five (2012) JURNAL PSIKOLOGI, 39, pp. 189-207; McShane, S.L., Glinow, M.A.V., (2012) Organizational Behavior, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Nipaporn Chanamarn, P.S.K.T., Stacking Technique for Academic Achievement Prediction (2016) International Workshop on Smart Info-Media Systems in Asia; Wahid, D.H., Peringkasan Sentimen Esktraktif di Twitter Menggunakan Hybrid TF-IDF dan Cosine Similarity (2016) IJCCS (Indonesian Journal of Computing and Cybernetics Systems), 10 (2), pp. 207-218","Sopianti, Y.; School of Computing, Indonesia; email: yuli.sopianti@gmail.com",,,"Science and Engineering Research Support Society",,,,,20054238,,,,"English","Int.

Attributes such as mechanics and dynamics that can be added to a system other than games make gamification development begin to be carried out in all business sectors. This paper aims at inviting millennial generation to be aware of the long-term insurance needs by using elements in the game. Millennial are known to learn fast in using new things and get bored quickly. While insurance companies in Indonesia think about how insurance products are made and assume their products can make all people want to buy insurance, but in reality, almost all insurance products fail to get the millennial market. An obstacle that usually happens is where millennial is confused in choosing the means to spend money even though they have small income. Microinsurance is the right choice for millennial generation in terms of insurance.

The majority of mall in Jakarta have difficulty to develop plan that enables to optimize their parking slots. Some malls use valet system to gain more profit or ease the customers, unfortunately the valet system price is quite expensive for major customers and it sounds unpopular. Therefore, many area of valet parking space is not maximized. The similar problems also faced by traditional parking system where it creates problems for customers such as difficult to find parking space, paper ticket missing and unable to locate car location. The purpose in this study is to propose a Smart Parking System (SPS) through the use of Internet of Things (IoT). The article applies smart parking system that enables online booking system, paperless ticket, cashless payments and automated guided parking. The objective of the article is expected to enhance the current online parking management system with IoT design, with the aim to be used as reference for parking management in malls. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,"Pardosi, T., (2016) STATISTIK TRANSPORTASI DKI Jakarta 2016, , Jakarta: BPS Provinsi DKI Jakarta; Wang, H., He, W., A reservation-based smart parking system (2011) Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)Conference on, pp. 690-695. , IEEE; Den Ardjuna, D., (2015) Internet of Thinks Methode and Implementation, p. 12. , rerasearch gate; Armstrong, E., (2015) Taking the U.

This involves planning, testing, tracking and reporting. Task management can help achieve individual goals, individual groups collaborate and share knowledge to achieve common goals. [1] Tasks are also distinguished by complexity, from low to high. Task management can form part of project management and process management for efficient workflows within an organization. Project managers who adhere to task-oriented management have a detailed and up-to-date project schedule, and a good team directs members and advances the project. [2] At present, the Task management system is growing along with the rapid advances in technology, so that anyone can access wherever he is. However, the majority of the current Task management system is not able to attract the attention and interest of its users. The concept of gamification will be applied to the ask management system so that work management is more organized, interesting and fun. This gamified system design will use the Marczewski's Gamification Framework. Framework that has user types with the needs of learning and self-development. Game mechanics in this user types such as levels, challenges, and rewards can support gamified system users in achieving goals.

This kind of business offers a low limited loan amount for customer needs. The online loan business only verifies the current data of each customer for the user profiling process. Due to insufficient profile data of customers in person, the limit cannot go higher than it is now. But this business has the potential to grow and provide a better-customized loan amount according to each customer's financial conditions. The lack of customer data profile can be solved by integrating the data and loan system with big data. Big data offers a way to give online loan business a more accurate profiling system to track the customer financial history and many more. By having sufficient data of potential customers, the online loan companies can provide higher loan amounts to the customers based on their financial track. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

This study using qualitative research on research methodology. The data collection technique is conducted by interviewing two people representing an organization and carried out to three organizations in Indonesia. The result of this study, Although the organization recognizes the greatness of big data especially for proper management control, it is constrained by the large costs of collecting and processing big data, which exceeds the core operating costs of their business, and they are not ready for big data processing because they are faced with special expertise needs in running big data that they don't already have. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The scheme of applying premium rates in Indonesia is uncorrelated when viewed from the basic principles of insurance in determining premium contributions. Groups of individuals with safe driving behavior are equated with groups of individuals who have more dangerous risk characteristics. The new schema can provide information about speed, speed acceleration, hard braking, etc. Where insurance companies can apply premium contributions from the assessment of driving behavior. The new schema is harness technology in the vehicle will recover in real time the vehicle data, including driving time, distance, and average speed, maximum speed of the driver, the amount of sharp turns, the location and the route of use of the vehicle which will be automatically stored in the database. Not only supported by technology but also the new schema vehicle in Indonesia acquired fairness in premium insurance price determination between good behavior driver and bad behavior driver. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The innovations make life activies easier and efficient. One of technology innovation widely known in Indonesia is GO-JEK. This study is intended for the users of GO-JEK application. GO-JEK was initially an Indonesian-based company engaged in the transportation services using an online-based mobile application. Since it was founded in 2011, GO-JEK has grown rapidly and reached many consumers. This research aims to see how factors such as discounts, promos, transaction speeds, convenience, etc. affect the users in using GO-PAY as a means of payment. The data show that the transaction volume using FinTech payment has risen significantly. Authors want to conduct the study on what factors make people interested in choosing GO-PAY and remain loyal to use it. The research can be used in FinTech development in the future or used in other research as based what factors that have priority above the others. The study was completed by conducting a survey for 3-days, involving 71 GO-JEK application users living in the Greater Jakarta area. The data collected was then processed using multiple linear regression analysis. Data processing results show that cost savings, speed, convenience, and security guarantee offered in GO-PAY, altogether have significant effects on its use as a means of payment or transaction. The study show that the most significant factor influencing the user to use GO-PAY as means of payment is the variable of Security Guarantee. © 2019 IEEE.","costs; Fin Tech; GO-PAY; multiple linear regression; security; transaction speed","Costs; Fintech; Information systems; Information use; Linear regression; GO-PAY; Ict development; Mobile applications; Multiple linear regression analysis; Multiple linear regressions; security; Technology innovation; Transportation services; Data handling",,,,,,"(2019) About Gojek History and Services, , https://www.gojek.com, Accessed on: Aug. 15, 2019; Ferdiana, A.M.K., Darma, G.S., Understanding fintech through go-pay (2019) International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology, 4 (2), pp. 257-260; Zavolokina, L., Dolata, M., Schwabe, G., The FinTech phenomenon: Antecedents of financial innovation perceived by the popular press (2016) Financial Innovation, 2 (1), p. 16; (2016) BI Akan Terbitkan Aturan Main E-wallet, , https://kominfo.go.id/index.php/content/detail/6771/BI+akan+terbitkan+aturan+main+e-wallet/0/sorotan-media, Feb. 15, Accessed on Feb 2019; Iman, N., (2016) Financial Technology Dan Lembaga Keuangan, , Gathering Mitra Linkage Bank Syariah; Dave, C., (2015) Digital Business and ECommercemManagement, , 6th edition © Marketing Insights Limited; De Bel, J., Gâza, M., (2011) Mobile Payments 2012-My Mobile, My Wallet?, , Innopay, Version 1.01; Contini, D., Merritt, C.M., (2011) Mobile Payments in the United States: Mapping Out the Road Ahead.

Waste Bank is local wisdom initiative from Indonesia for the waste management. Waste banks are established in a special environment for around 1,000 residents and are usually managed by people and targeted to people who want to increase their income. Bank customers bring all non-organic waste to banks that are treated as deposits. Transactions are recorded preferably in the bank book that the customer keeps or alternates in the list stored by the bank. Many banks also accept organic waste while the rest support composting at home. Waste banks sell materials stored to agents or ultimately to waste bank central developed by government and supplied to company for reuse or recycling. So, waste deposits are converted into money that can be withdrawn when needed after a contribution of around 10% to 15% is reduced for bank operational costs. Community empowerment through the concept of a waste bank still needs the support of infrastructure and information technology facilities and profitable partnerships. The empowerment program for the citizens were conducted through counseling, education, training with as well as dialogue with the citizens in the targeted community. The community waste bank will not have the potential to grow without the involvement and support from the stakeholders. It becomes important to develop model and implement the partnerships, networking and institutional cooperation mechanism between the community, waste bank management, institution, business and government. The integrated partnership on waste management with system information support can generate creativity and innovation as well as to improve the welfare of the community. This paper discuss about designing mobile apps business development for integrated waste management system. It’s a proposed design model for apps and business model for waste management in Indonesia and other developing country. © BEIESP.","Case Study; Information System; Integrated Waste Management; Local Wisdom; Waste Bank",,,,,,,"Jambeck, J.R., Plastic Waste Inputs from Land into the ocean,”, p. 5; Hertati, D., Kebijakan Pengelolaan Sampah Berbasis Masyarakat Sebagai Solusi Alternatif Green City Di Kota Surabaya (2018) Din.

Currently, gamification method is widely applied in the world of education. Gamification learning method means applying of a game into the learning process, with the aim to foster motivation to learn and change student behavior. It makes teachers more creative in designing the learning process. Some of the developers have learned more about psychology science or other sciences that study human motivation and behavior. The aim is to motivate students in the learning process and maximizing feelings of enjoyment and involvement with the learning process, besides this media can be used to capture the things that interest students and inspire them to keep learning. This study aims to propose a gamification model that are flexible in LMS, have good performance and can be improved student performance in their study. © 2019 IEEE.","Education; Gamification; Learning Management System","Behavioral research; Education; Education computing; Motivation; Students; Game industry; Gamification; Innovative learning; Learning management system; Learning methods; Learning process; Student behavior; Student performance; Learning systems",,,,,,"Kolekar, S.V., Pai, R.M., Manohara Pai, M.M., Adaptive User Interface for Moodle based E-learning System using Learning Styles (2018) Procedia.

At present the community must pay for the cost of rubbish, whereas rubbish can be useful and profitable if managed properly. One way to manage waste properly is to save waste at the Trash Bank. At present there are already several garbage banks established, but the garbage banks that have been run are not yet optimal, not all people use these facilities. Lack of knowledge and infrastructure facilities hamper the waste management process at the garbage bank. Therefore, the authors propose the concept of an integrated system based on service oriented architecture (SOA) to integrate garbage pickup services, banks, garbage banks, cooperatives, gas, electricity, cable tv, public relations, e-commerce and health insurance as a means of supporting infrastructure to support waste management. The method in this study uses Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The results of this study are in the form of a waste management application design: Go-Waste which integrates waste pick-up service, banks, garbage banks, cooperatives, gas, electricity, cable tv, public relations, e-commerce and health insurance in one platform using a service oriented architecture (SOA). © BEIESP.","Garbage bank; Service-oriented architecture (SOA); Waste management service information system",,,,,,,"(2018), www.menlhk.go.id; (2018), www.litbang.kemendagri.go.id; Erl, T., (2005) Service-Oriented Architecture: Concepts, Technology, and Design, , Prentice Hall PTR; Walean, D.D., Sistem Informasi Akademik Berbasis Web Mobile Menggunakan ASP.NET (Studi Kasus Teknik Elektro UNSRAT) (2011) Manado.

Cloud computing offers several potential benefits that many e- governments over the world are trying to obtain by adopting cloud solutions into their architecture and public services. This paper focuses on designing GEA using TOGAF ADM based on the G-cloud model. The conceptual relationship between cloud computing in government agencies and information architecture is provided to provide a better picture in the implementation of GEA. A mapping model for G-cloud implementation is presented, as well as services provided by the G-Vendor cloud to describe the objectives and potential requirements for conceptualization processes. The proposed framework is expected to increase the success rate of e-government implementation in Indonesia, which has declined significantly over the last 8 years. However, that does not rule out the possibility of being implemented in other countries so that e-government can provide the promised benefits to their citizens. © 2019 IJSTR.","E-government; Enterprise architecture; Government cloud (g-cloud); Government enterprise architecture; Indonesia; TOGAF",,,,,,,"Setiawan, A., Yulianto, E., E-Government Interoperability and Integration Architecture Modeling Using TOGAF Framework Based On Service Oriented Architecture (2018) The Asian Journal of Technology Management, 11 (1), pp. 26-45; Saha, P., (2010) Enterprise architecture as platform for connected government: Understanding the impact of enterprise architecture on connected government, , National University of Singapore Institute of Systems Science; Budiardjo, E.K., Firmansyah, G., Hasibuan, Z.A., Weighted Components of i-Government Enterprise Architecture (2017) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 801 (1), p. 12025; Saiya, A.A., Arman, A.A., Indonesian Enterprise Architecture Framework: A Platform for Integrated and Connected Government (2018) 2018 International Conference on ICT for Smart Society (ICISS), pp. 1-6; (2016) United Nations E-Government Survey 2016: E-Government in Support of Sustainable Development, , United Nations; Firmansyah, G., Hasibuan, Z.A., Sucahyo, Y.G., Indonesia e-Government components: A principal component analysis approach (2014) 2014 International Conference on Information Technology Systems and Innovation (ICITSI), pp. 148-152; (2003) Presidential Directive No. 3/2003 about National Policy and Strategy for e-Government Development, , Indonesian Republic Cabinet Secretariat.

The role of doctors and nurses' knowledge becomes a benchmark in determining the performance and quality of services, in this case the Knowledge Management System (KMS) can be a solution in supporting the knowledge management process. However, the growth of innovation in knowledge management is also needed in practice. So Big Data as a large data processing technology and various types of data will be a supporter in the process of increasing and accelerating the growth of knowledge of doctors and nurses at the XYZ ISLAMIC HOSPITAL by providing relevant information as needed. Then it is necessary to design a KMS that uses Big data as one of the enablers in the process of creating knowledge for doctors and nurses and then can be stored and shared. This design is done by using the Knowledge Management System Agile Implementation Methodology (KMSAIM) which prioritizes the initiation process in each problem domain so that each component has the right and relevant solutions. The KMS design results are in the form of site-based applications that have file sharing features, discussion forums for sharing medical experiences and there are search features needed by doctors and nurses for inpatient services at XYZ ISLAMIC HOSPITAL. © 2019 IEEE","Big Data; Inpatient Medical Service; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Management System","Benchmarking; Big data; Data handling; Hospital data processing; Hospitals; Knowledge based systems; Nursing; Discussion forum; Health services; Implementation methodology; Initiation process; Inpatient services; Knowledge management process; Knowledge management system; Medical services; Knowledge management",,,,,,"Andreas, B., (2016) Knowledge Management: Efektif Berinovasi Meraih Sukses, , Jakarta, Indonesia: Prasetiya Mulya Publishing; Khasawneh, R., Abu-Shanab, E., Using KMS as a tool to improve decision making process (2013) Knowledge-Based Processes in Software Development, pp. 1-11. , January 2016; Rahimli, A., Knowledge management and competitive advantage (2012) Information and Knowledge Management, pp. 37-43; Nonaka, I., Toyama, R., The knowledge-creating theory revisited: Knowledge creation as a synthesizing process (2003) Knowl.

In increasing the value of its business, many hospitals open branches in various regions so that it requires integration from each branch. However, there is often a failure of IT (Information Technology) implementation because there is no alignment with the objectives of the organization where each hospital incorporated in the group still works independently. Enterprise Architecture is one solution to overcome the failure of IT implementation in organizations. This study aims to build Enterprise Architecture in the hospital group. The case study to support this research was conducted in one of the hospital groups in Indonesia namely Kasih Group. The method used is a combination of ESIA (Eliminate, Simplify, Integrate, Automate) and TOGAF ADM (The Open Group Architecture Framework Architecture Development Method). The results of this study are the Enterprise Architecture design in the hospital group which consists of 5 phases, namely: business engineering, initialize architecture, business architecture development, information system architecture and develop technology architecture. © 2019 IEEE","Enterprise architecture; ESIA; Hospital group; TOGAF ADM","Business architecture; Business engineering; Development method; Enterprise Architecture; ESIA; Information system architecture; Open group architecture frameworks; Technology architectures; Hospitals",,,,,,"Purnawan, D.A., Surendro, K., Building enterprise architecture for hospital information system (2016) Fourth International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies (ICoICT); Sajid, M., Ahsan, K., Enterprise architecture for healthcare organizations (2014) World Applied Sciences Journal, 30 (10), pp. 1330-1333. , 2014; Shah, H., Ahsan, K., Kingston, P., Healthcare modelling through enterprise architecture: A hospital case (2010) Seventh International Conference on Information Technology, pp. 460-465; Bobarshad, H., Rezaei, M.S., Saghafi, F., Hospital enterprise architecture framework (Study of iranian university hospital organization) (2018) International Journal of Medical Informatics; Rijo, R., Martinho, R., Ermida, D., (2015) Developing an Enterprise Architecture Proof of Concept in a Portuguese Hospital, , Elsevier B; Handayani, P.W., Pinem, A.A., Munajat, Q., Azzahro, F., Hidayanto, A.N., Ayuningtyas, D., Sartono, A., Health referral enterprise architecture design in Indonesia (2019) The Korean Society of Medical Informatics; Qurratuaini, H., Designing enterprise architecture based on TOGAF 9.1 framework (2018) International Conference on Engineering and Applied Technology (ICEAT); Wikusna, W., (2017) Enterprise Architecture Model for Vocational High School, , School of Applied Science, Telkom University; Nugroho, H., Proposed IT governance at hospital based on COBIT 5 framework (2017) School of Applied Science, , Telkom University; Sajid, M., Ahsan, K., Role of enterprise architecture in healthcare organizations and knowledge-based medical diagnosis system (2016) Journal of Information Systems and Technology Management; Microservices Reference Architecture, , www.ibm.com, Online.Available:https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/architectures/ microservices/reference-architecture.

PT GDA adopts innovations and technology that are currently developing as new knowledge and developed into products and services. Knowledge in this company is a major asset that drives to be more innovative and improve the competitiveness of companies in business as a provider of optimal and leading technology solutions. Knowledge management (KM) is a concept that is needed to manage and make explicit knowledge. PT GDA requires a Knowledge Management System (KMS) as an information system that can be applied to support KM processes and mechanisms with the support of human resources, technology and tools. The implementation of this system is to avoid the risk of ignorance and loss of knowledge in organizations with the movement of human resources. This paper compares and reviews Knowledge Management Success Factors (KMCSFs) from previous studies so that it became KMCSFs in accordance with PT GDA. This paper aims to analyze the readiness of KMS implementation in this company by analyzing the data obtained through a questionnaire.

However, a smartwatch as an extension of a smartphone experienced a different thing. This study aims to investigate the relationship between usability, brands, and prices towards the perspective of consumers in Indonesia on smartwatches. We surveyed 116 smartwatch users and interviewed ten of them to get a complete understanding of their perceptions. This study reveals that the usage of smartwatches is less significant in influencing consumer perceptions, while brands and prices are strongly influencing the perception of consumers who have used smartwatches. Besides, this study also revealed that most respondents chose the smartwatch brand based on its smartphone brand. Xiaomi smartwatches were more affordable than other brands. Following Apple and Samsung, which ensured that they still have a safe place in the hearth of Indonesian customers. © 2019 The Authors.","Brand; Indonesia; Pricing; Smartwatch; Usability","Costs; Information systems; Information use; Smartphones; Brand; Consumer perception; Daily lives; Indonesia; Smartwatch; Usability; Usability studies; Users' perception; Wearable computers",,,,,,"Castillejo, P., Martínez, J.-F., López, L., Rubio, G., An internet of things approach for managing smart services provided by wearable devices (2013) International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks, 9 (2), pp. 1-9; Mann, S., Wearable computing: A first step toward personal imaging (1997) Computer, 30 (2), pp. 25-32; Jung, Y., Kim, S., Choi, B., Consumer valuation of the wearables: The case of smartwatches (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, 63, pp. 899-905; Choi, J., Kim, S., Is the smartwatch an IT product or a fashion product ?

Several institutions of Early Childhood Education began to introduce local culture to their students, but the limited time and place to be a separate constraint for the activity. Digital media can solve this problem by presenting an introduction to local culture which can be accessed without time and place limitation, but there are some problems of using the existing application because children have their own characteristics and different ways of absorbing a knowledge. From the observation of an early childhood, it is known that children more easily absorb knowledge through playing game and listening to the story telling. Story telling invites children to develop their imagination and more memorable, so that information can be better absorbed. To accommodate the learning need, this research developed the User Interface (UI) by combining a game and a story telling. This modelling involves the participation of early childhood and companions using child-centered design (CCD) methods.

Educational disturbances found in children with ADHD at Elementary School are low interest in learning, weak memorizing, unenthusiastic with large text and lack of concentration. They have less interest in Social Science Subjects. There are some learning applications developed to help children learn social science. However, there is none focused on ADHD children. Thus, a study was conducted to determine the user interface model of interactive learning application of social science subjects in accordance with user experience in ADHD children by implementing the Children-Centered Design method. Then we analyzed the application usability level measured using USE Questionnaire. The usability testing of the prototype has resulted in average usability of 90.05%, this shows the category of application is very good and can be used for children ADHD. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,"Behavioral research; Design; Educational technology; Learning systems; User interfaces; Design method; Elementary schools; Interactive learning; Usability testing; User experience; User interface models; Computer aided instruction",,,,,,"Kumaladewi, D., Istiarini, A.D., (2016) Konsultasi Mengenai Anak ABK Dengan Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; Mahabbati, A., Pendidikan Inklusif untuk Anak dengan Gangguan Emosi dan Perilaku (Tunalaras) (2010) Jurnal Pendidikan Khusus, 7 (2), pp. 52-63; Hirsh-Pasek, Putting education in Educational apps lessons from the science of learning (2015) Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 16 (1), pp. 3-34; Hourcade, J.P., Interaction design and children (2007) Human-Computer Interaction, 1 (4), pp. 277-392; Kukulska-Hulme, A., Traxler, J., Mobile teaching and learning (2005) Mobile Learning: A Handbook for Educators and Trainers, , London: Routledge; (2013) UXLady, Introduction to User Personas, Retrieved from, , http://www.ux-lady.com, http://www.ux-lady.com/introduction-to-user-personas/; Sabariah, M.K., Effendy, V., Junaedi, D., (2015) Interaksi Manusia Dan Komputer, , Bandung: Diandra Kreatif; Lund, A.M., Measuring usability with the USE questionnaire, Retrieved from Measuring Usability with the USE Questionnaire STC Usability SIG Newsletter, p. 8; (2016), http://garyperlman.com/quest/quest.cgi?form=USE/; Fowler, M., (2004) Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities, p. 24; (2017) Understanding the Child-Centered Design (CCD) Process, , http://uxkids.com/ccd.html, Retrieved from UX Kids; Markopoulus, P., Read, J., (2012) International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction, pp. 1-5. , ELESEVIER; Idler, S., (2013) Child-Centered Design is User-Centeres Design, but Then Different, , http://uxkids.com/blog/child-centered-design-is-user-centered-design-but-then-different/, Retrieved from UXKids, August 16; Garrett, N.J., (2011) Conceptual Models, , Wireframes, Berkeley; (2010) User Experience Professionals Association.

Natural science becomes a problem for children because the way the teacher explains and media used is not maximal. The result is presented when students got poor grade and understanding. Elementary school children characteristic is playful, playing become the most effective way for children to learn. Snakes and ladders game developed by Daluti Delimanugari is used as learning media of natural science but this media still lack flexibility and practically. Technology is interesting to children because it presents motions, dimensions, sounds, colors, songs and varying materials. Children do not get those advantages from using other media. Therefore, this paper suggested a solution which is snakes and ladders game application as learning media for natural science. User-centered design used for designing the user interface focuses on the characteristic, task and environment of the users. The results of usability testing of the ladder snake game application that has been built obtain an average of 88.8%. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,"Ladders; Software design; Teaching; User centered design; Elementary schools; Learning media; Science learning; Snakes and ladders; Usability testing; User interface designs; User interfaces",,,,,,"(2016) Kementrian Pendidikan Dan Kebudayaan, Jendela Interaksi Kurikulum, , http://kurikulum.kemdikbud.go.id/, Accessed 18 Oktober 2016; (2016) IEA International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, TIMSS 2015, , http://timss2015.org/wp-content/uploads/filebase/full%20pdfs/T15International-Results-in-Science-Grade-4.pdf, Accessed 16 Januari 2017; Astri, F., (2016) Memunculkan Daya Tarik Pelajaran Sains, , https://pgsd.binus.ac.id/2016/06/29/memunculkan-daya-tarik-pelajaran-sains/, Accessed 8 Januari 2018; (2014) Sekolah Dasar Gemala Ananda, Bermain Dan Perkembangan Anak 6-12 Tahun, , http://www.gemalaananda.sch.id/2014/06/02/bermain-dan-perkembangan-anak-6-12-tahun/, Accessed 1 Januari 2018; Delimanugari, D., Pengembangan Media Permainan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam Untuk Meningkatkan Minat Dan Hasil Belajar Siswa MI/SD di Gunungkidul; Wulandari, P.Y., (2016) Anak Asuhan Gadget, , http://health.liputan6.com/read/2460330/anak-asuhan-gadget, Accessed 17 Desember 2017; Kukulska-Hulme, A., Traxler, J., Mobile teaching and learning (2005) Mobile Learning: A Handbook for Educators and Trainers, , London: Routledge; Pidoco, P., User Interface Design (UI Design), , https://pidoco.com/en/help/ux/user-interface-design, Accessed 2018 Januari 8; Nielsen, J., Nielsen Norman Group, , https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/, accessed 10 Juli 2017; Henry, S.L., (2007) Just Ask: Integrating Accessibility Throughout Design, , Lulu.com; (2017) Usability Partners, Standards in Usability and User-Centred Design, , http://www.usabilitypartners.se/about-usability/iso-standards.php, Accessed 16 Januari; Seffah, A., Donyaee, M., Kline, R.B., Padda, H.K., Usability measurement and metrics: A consolidated model (2006) Software Qual J., 14 (2), pp. 166-172","Junaedi, D.; Telkom University, Jl.

While the mathematics learning achievement of 5th grade elementary school students is low, as evidenced by the daily recapitulation data value of students who still score below the Minimum Exhaustiveness Criteria. According to the teacher the cause is the number of students who have not mastered the fraction material as the basis of mathematics material taught in class 5. So that required handling to achieve optimal results. According to research by Elvi Mailani, the Monopoly game used as a fractional math learning tool for elementary school children can have a positive impact by training children to hone their skills. But in this study, the media used less effective because it requires special handling to achieve goals and more optimal results. Based on these problems, a model of user interface for prototype application of fractional math monopoly game for elementary school students was designed. The goal directed design method is used as a design method that focuses on user goals. Based on the result of usability evaluation for the user interface model using QUIM obtained a percentage of 91.56%. So that the user interface model has fulfilled the usability element as a learning fraction media in Elementary school. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,"Competition; Design; Students; Teaching; Elementary school students; Elementary schools; Goal-directed design; Learning achievement; Mathematics learning; Positive impacts; Usability evaluation; User interface models; User interfaces",,,,,,"Mailani, E., (2015) Upaya Meningkatkan Hasil Belajar Matematika Pada Materi Pecahan Melalui Permainan Monopoli Pecahan, p. 4; Pho, A., Dinscore, A., (2015) Instruction Section-Game Based Learning, Tips and Trends Intructional Technologies Commitee; Sabariah, M.K., Effendy, V., Junaedi, D., (2015) Interaksi Manusia Dan Komputer, , Bandung: Diandra Creative Mirza; Kukulska-Hulme, A., Traxler, J., (2005) Mobile Teaching and Learning, in Mobile Learning: A Handbook for Educators and Trainers, , A.

SCRUM is one of example agile contain iteration called sprint which describes phasing running on the timeline of the project and by sprint planning the SCRUM master (as a leader) can direct the team to finish on a date. The motivation for SCRUM team member will influence the result, so in this research, we try to design a gamified method into SCRUM. We make a prototype design about gamification in SCRUM development and also spread a questionnaire to the respondent already have experience with SCRUM development. The result shows that people motivation will increase when they feel appreciated, rewarded and the atmosphere of the competition was made well supporting the team's performance. © 2018 IEEE.","agile; gamification; motivation; prototype; SCRUM; software development","Citrus fruits; Design; Iterative methods; Motivation; Software design; Software engineering; agile; Agile approaches; Gamification; prototype; Prototype designs; SCRUM; Software development methods; Software development projects; Software prototyping",,,,,,"Cooper, L., (2015) Universal Agile Thinking-Supporting the Organization, , https://www.slideshare.net/cooperlk/universal-agile-thinking, Accessed: 29-Jul-2018; Korkishko, I., (2017) Top 6 Software Development Methodologies, , https://dev.to/iriskatastic/top-6-software-development-methodologies-9b, Accessed: 29-Jul-2018; (2015) Agile Methodologies for Software Development, , https://www.versionone.com/agile-101/agile-methodologies/, VersiOne.

Electricity consumption caused by an uncontrolled load is different depending on the number of usage. This monitoring system employs the usage of voltage, current, and water volume sensors. These sensors read the data of output power from micro-hydro power plant, then Wi-Fi router is used to send the data to the Thingspeak database. From the experimental results, micro-hydro monitoring system can record the voltage, current, and water volume in real-time to the thingspeak database for every 30 seconds. It is believed that this system will be useful as one of solutions for data monitoring of micro-hydro output power-based IoTs in the future. © 2018 IEEE.","electricity consumption; Internet of Things (IoTs); micro-hydro power plant; sensors; Thingspeak database","Citrus fruits; Database systems; Electric power utilization; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Internet of things; Sensors; Data monitoring; Electrical output; Electricity-consumption; Internet of thing (IoTs); Microhydro power plants; Monitoring system; Research papers; Water volumes; Monitoring",,,,,,"https://www.smartgrid.gov/the_smart_grid/smart_grid.html; Giakoumelos, E., (2016) Handbook on Renewable Energy Sources; Zeinab, K.A.M., Elmustafa, S.A.A., Internet of things applications, challenges and related future technologies (2017) World Scientific News, 67 (2), pp. 126-148; Pasha, S., Thingspeak based sensing and monitoring system for IoT with matlab analysis (2016) Int Journal of New Technology and Research (IJNTR), 2 (6), pp. 19-23. , June; (2015) Arduino Mega 2560 Datasheet, p. 3; (2014) Arduino Ethernet Shield, p. 2; (2013) TP-LINK 3020, p. 15; (2012) ZMPT101B Datasheet, p. 2; (2000) Allegro MicroSystems, LLC.

The task of integrating such system is quite complicated, especially the integration of the financial technology system. In addition to being integrated, the flow of data and business processes must effectively reach every part which has interests in the process and the data. Business productivity can be achieved if the required data flows smoothly and is accessible as efficient as possible. Similarly, a bank which usually uses more than one information systems, when it need to combine financial statements from different bank systems must go through a data transformation mechanism to be accessible. Especially if the users of some bank accounts must access all their banking accounts at one time, of course, this would not be easy. As a response to those situations, in this research we proposed a financial technology application integration based on SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) which could be used to combine financials statements of all integrated banks every month. The data required to create a composite report will be directly taken from the system of any bank by utilizing web services. It is expected that the results from this study could help the parties interested in SOA-based Fin Tech with the understanding and description of SOA, such as: how it works, its benefits, and the role of SOA layers implemented in Fin Tech applications. © 2018 IEEE.","Architecture; Fin Tech; SOA; System","Architecture; Citrus fruits; Finance; Fins (heat exchange); Information services; Integration; Metadata; Web services; Business productivity; Customer expectation; Fin Tech; Financial transactions; Soa (serviceoriented architecture); System; Technology application; Technology Integration; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,,"Papazoglou, M.P., Georgakopoulos, D., Service oriented computing: Introduction (2003) Communications of the ACM, 46 (10), pp. 25-28; Meredith, L.G., Bjorg, S., Contracts and types (2003) Communications of the ACM, 46 (10), pp. 41-47; Arsanjani, A., (2004) Service-oriented Modeling and Architecture, p. 2; Josuttis Nicloai, M., SOA in practice (2007) O'Relly 2007, p. 210; Richard, B., (2005) Extensible Architectures: The Strategic Value of Service-oriented Architecture in Banking, , Department of Computer Information Systems, Robinson College of Business, Georgia State University; Bret, K., (2010) Bank 2.0: How Customer Behaviour and Technology Will Change the Future of Financial Services-Marshall Cavendish, , Business; Riad, A.M., Hassan, Q.F., Service-oriented architecture-A new alternative to traditional integration methods in B2B applications (2008) JCIT, 3 (1). , March 31, 2008; Papazoglou, M.P., Service-oriented computing: Concepts, characteristics, and directions (2003) Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE'03); Fajar, A.N., Legowo, N., Services modeling based on SOA and BPM for information system flexibility improvement (2018) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 8 (4), pp. 2451-2455; Fajar, A.N., Nurcahyo, A., Sriratnasari, S.R., SOA system architecture for interconnected modern higher education in Indonesia (2018) Procedia Computer Science the 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Computational Intelligence (ICCSCI 2018); 10 Best Android Budget Apps for Money Management, , https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-budget-apps-for-moneymanagement-586807/, Android Authority, 16-Jul-2018.

The main problem when the harvest season arrives is the decline in commodity prices due to a large number of goods available. This problem is undoubtedly detrimental to farmers and traders. Therefore the Ministry of Trade introduced this Warehouse Receipt System. One of the Warehouse Receipt Systems is located in Grobogan District having its address at Wirosari District, Grobogan Regency. WRS Grobogan Regency was inaugurated at the end of 2015. All activities related to data management are still manual yet computerized. Based on these problems, a Management Information System in the Warehouse Receipt System in Grobogan Regency is needed. with this system, starting from the process of submission of goods, data collection, pricing, issuance of receipts, until reporting becomes computerized. This study uses the Scrum methodology. At the end of the study, User Acceptance Testing was conducted. Test results show 100% value.

SNC tends to have no concept to manage time, it makes them difficult to understand what activities they need to do in their daily life, and therefore it is necessary to schedule events for SNC so that they know when and how the action should be done. The result is expected to help SNC and parents in learning to perform regular daily events and other activities provided by parents. In this research, User Interface also available for parents to input action and its step by step so SPC could understand that. The interface model can be used as a tool for SNC therapy to familiarize themselves in doing the activity at the right time. This research uses User-Centered Design (UCD) for designing the user interface with a focus on what the user needs and task. The result of this study shown that the interface model of scheduling activity increases the usability up to more than 85%. © 2017 IEEE.","Autism; Children with special needs; Scheduling activity; User interface; User-Centered design","Citrus fruits; Diseases; Scheduling; Software design; User centered design; Autism; Autistic children; Daily lives; Interface designs; Interface model; Scheduling activities; Special needs; User Centered Design(UCD); User interfaces",,,,,,"Kurnia, E., (2015) Okezone, , http://lifestyle.okezone.com/read/2015/04/02/481/1128312/autisme-diindonesia-terus-meningkat, [Online]; Torii, T.N.N.I.K.O.P., Study and development of schedule application for autistic children (2013) International Conference on Advanced Applied Informatics; Ippei, T.K.O.N.I., Development and study of support application for autistic children (2013) ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, AI, Networking and Parallel; Williams, A., (2010) User-Centered Design, Activity-Centered Design, and Goal-Directed Design: A Review of Three Methode for Designing Web Application; User-Centered Design Basics, , https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-centereddesign.html, Usability Gov, "", "" Usability Gov, [Online].

It affects the learning patterns for the children. The applied model of learning should be more interesting. The problem that occurs in the study of Indonesian's animals for a child, that children can't imagine or visualize the forms, movements, and sounds of animals. Therefore, it needs other instructional media for learning animal such as smartphone apps. This study is about designing apps for Indonesian Animal Introduction using Augmented Reality Technology. With Augmented reality technology in the apps give a good impact to the child because with AR children can feel the real shape of the animal and can help children to remember and imagine the shape of the object quickly. The approach is taken to design the application prototype is Goal-Directed Design following the needs and goals of users in learning about the animal from Indonesia. The prototype tested its usability level using QUIM. From prototype test results get the value with a percentage of 91%, so it concluded that the usability level of the application of learning to know animals from Indonesia is following the characteristics of early childhood. © 2017 IEEE.","Animal Introduction; Augmented Reality; Goal Directed Design; User Interface","Animals; Augmented reality; Citrus fruits; Augmented reality technology; Early childhoods; Goal-directed design; Instructional media; Learning patterns; Prototype tests; Smartphone apps; User interface models; User interfaces",,,,,,"Hardyana, S.E., (2016) Animasi Interaktif Pengenalan Hewan Khas Indonesia Berbasis AR Pada TK Kupu-kupu Mungil Bekasi, p. 1; Siegler, J.D.D.N.E.R., (2011) How Children Develop, , dalam 3rd Edition, New York, Worth; Vallino, J.R., (1998) Interactive Augmented Reality, , New York University og Rochester; Radu, Why should my students use AR?

This growing number is not only based on the website pattern, but also in the 3D online virtual environment. Over the last three years the practice of online churchgoing in the 3D virtual environment has grown rapidly through the arrival of a number of large, well-financed projects supported by well-known real-world Christian groups. This phenomenon has been allowing users not only just participate but also experiencing the online virtual environment. What are the users' experiences in the virtual church? How does this experience relate to users' spiritual life? These issues will be discussed in this chapter, starting with origin of online church. This is followed by the description of the one year study result based on participant observation and interview with the participants. The ability of Second Life as user generated virtual environment to act as medium of ritual practice and kinds of experience fostered will be interesting in the future development of the online church. The empirical based study may contribute greatly to a more nuanced and balanced understanding. © 2012, IGI Global.",,,,,,,,"Aden, R.C., (1999) Popular Stories and Promised Lands: Fan Cultures and Symbolic Pilgrimages, , Tuscaloosa, AL: The University of Alabama Press; Argyle, M., (1996) The Social Psychology of Leisure, , Harmondsworth, UK: Penguin; Au, W.J., (2004) Where Two or More are Gathered, , http://secondlife.blogs.com/nwn/2004/04/where_two_or_mo.html, Retrieved March 1, 2010, from; Beit Hallahmi, B., Argyle, M., (1997) The Psychology of Religious Behavior, Belief and Experience, , New York, NY: Routledge; Boellstorf, T., (2008) Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Bourdieu, P., (1977) Outline of a Theory of Practice, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Bray, D.A., Konsynski, B., (2006) Virtual Worlds, Virtual Economies, Virtual Institutions, , SSRN eLibrary; Bunt, G.R., Rip.

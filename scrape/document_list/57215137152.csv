Other than that, the utilization of internet of things (IoT) technology has become one of great technology that match for complex system with a minimal use of hardware. With the implementation of IoT based on cloud computing, several smart devices, and also smart automatic machine, the concept of smart parking system are expected to be able to provide services for car parking spot searching and car parking spot allocation through the mobile application. © 2019 IEEE.","Automatic Machine; Cloud Computing; Cloud Database; Integrated Application; Internet Of Things; Parking system; Smart Devices","Cloud computing; Garages (parking); Automatic machines; Cloud database; Integrated applications; Parking systems; Smart devices; Internet of things",,,,,"Guo, Y., Yang, Y., Zhu, H., Yang, L., Liu, X., (2016) Smart Health Service System Based on Service-oriented, pp. 204-215; Anath, S., Sathya, P., Madhan, P., (2019) Smart Health Monitoring System through IOT; Pradeep, S.K., Richard, V., Bharath, U., Rao, M., Eswar, K., (2017) Smart Health Monitoring System of Patient through IoT; Malche, T., Maheswary, P., (2017) Internet of Things (IoT) for Building Smart Home System; Salman, L., Salman, S., Jahangirian, S., Abraham, M., German, F., Blair, C., Krenz, P., (2016) Energy Efficient IoT-Based Smart Home; Zhanlin, J., Ganchev, I., O'Droma, M., Zhang, X., (2014) A Cloud-Based Intelligent Car Parking Services for Smart Cities; Nam Pham, T., Tsai, M., Nguyen, D., Dow, C., Deng, D., (2015) A Cloud-Based Smart-Parking System Based on Internet-of-Things Technologies; Lambrinos, L., Dosis, A., (2013) DisAssist: An Internet of Things and Mobile Communications Platform for Disabled Parking Space Management; Bonde, D.J., Shende, R.S., Kedari, A.S., Gaikwad, K.S., Bhokre, A.U., (2014) AUTOMATED CAR PARKING SYSTEM COMMANDED by ANDROID APPLICATION; Kilic, T., Tuncer, T., (2017) Smart City Application: Android Based Smart Parking System; Kate, G., Dave, K., Kulkarni, S., Dhumale, R., (2015) ANDROID APPLICATION for S-PARK SYSTEM; Babu, S.K., Athuluri, M., Venkatram, D.N., (2018) ANDROID BASED REAL TIME ADVANCE SECURITY of PARKING SYSTEM in IOT; Thuemmler, C., Bai, C., Health 4.0: How virtualization and big data are revolutionizing healthcare (2017) Heal. 4.0 How Virtualization Big Data Are Revolutionizing Healthc., pp. 1-254; Thuemmler, C., Bai, C., Health 4.0: How virtualization and big data are revolutionizing healthcare (2017) Heal. 4.0 How Virtualization Big Data Are Revolutionizing Healthc., pp. 1-254",,"Supangkat S.H.Sembiring J.Arman A.A.Nugraha IGB.B.Bandung Y.",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","10th International Conference on ICT for Smart Society, ICISS 2019","19 November 2019 through 20 November 2019",,157204,,9781728148809,,,"English","Proceeding - Int.

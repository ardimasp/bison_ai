The city and regency of Cirebon were selected in this study to see the potential and the obstacles that occur to make these areas as tourist destination. Kertajati international airport is available, dozens of tourist destinations both for enjoying culinary, historical, religious sites, supporting adequate intercity and local transportation, and so on. The main problem for Cirebon for tourists who will or are visiting the city is the specific and clear information about the destination. The opportunity and obstacles to find the best solution are evaluated through the Value Shop system. The need for a mobile application framework that is well developed and backed with comprehensive data is proposed. The design of the application framework uses the OOAD process. It is hoped that this application framework will make it easy for prospective travelers to feel comfortable toward what they can get from the city and regency of Cirebon. In addition, the Population and the government of Cirebon city and regency will be able to boost their wealth. © 2020 IEEE.","Mobile application; The city and regency of cirebon; Tourism; Value shop","Information management; Application frameworks; International airport; Mobile applications; Tourism activities; Tourist destinations; Mobile computing",,,,,"Purnawati, T., Rute dan Maskapai Bertambah, Penumpang Pesawat Dari Kertajati Meningkat Akhir Tahun 2019 (2019) Pikiran Rakyat, , https://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/jawa-barat/pr-01326974/rute-danmaskapai-bertambah-penumpang-pesawat-dari-bandara-kertajatimeningkat-akhir-tahun-2019, 20 Desember Accessed on February 10 2020; (2020) Kemenag Pastikan Bandara Kertajati Layani Penerbangan Ibadah Haji 2020, , https://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/bandung-raya/pr-01326725/kemenag-pastikan-bandara-kertajati-layani-penerbanganibadah-haji-2020, Sarnapi Pikiran Rakyat, 9 Desember Accessed on February 10, 2020; (2020) 19 Tempat Wisata di Cirebon Terbaru Yang Menarik Dikunjungi, , https://wisatalengkap.com/tempat-wisata-di-cirebon-terbaru/, Accessed on February 13; Kroenke, D.M., Boyle, R.J., (2018) Using Mis, , 10th Edition, Global Edition, Pearson; Guemide, B., Benachaiba, C., Maouche, S., Integrating ICT-based applications dor sustainable tourism development in Algeria Journal of Tourism & Hospitality.

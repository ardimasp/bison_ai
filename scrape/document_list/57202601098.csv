Online learning or e-learning is an alternative to accelerate English learning since it is no limitation to time and place. Universities around the world are investigating e-learning system to support their traditional teaching system. Some previous research showed an effective learning system when meet the students’ needs This study was undertaken to find out whether the implementation of English online learning system would give positive impacts for the students in Binus University. The study was done by spreading survey questionnaire with Google Form and through two forms of social media, such as Line and WhatsApp, had yielded responses from 38 students. The respondents supported this idea of implementing online learning for English subject and had their personal reasons. Overall perceptions of the online learning were positive. The majority of students in the online learning indicated that they would prefer if the approach was offered. Therefore, this research found that online learning for English subject was applicable in Binus University. © 2020, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

In addition, this paper reflected upon the problems in the implementation of hybrid learning in higher education setting. Hybrid learning approach recently turns out to be an attractive mode of delivery to many learners because it does not only provide the convenience of a primarily-online course, but also permits meetings with lecturer in person. This was quantitative research and used the quasi-experimental approach. The sample consisted of 265 first-year undergraduates taking English course at one of private universities in Jakarta. The experimental group used the hybrid learning whereas the control group conventional learning. The instrument used in this research was post-test. Data from post-test was analyzed using t-test. Based on the t-test, null hypothesis was accepted. The result indicated that there was no significant difference between learners' learning performance in their listening and reading skills and two approaches using both traditional face-to-face learning and blended learning. One of the hybrid learning main consideration was the importance of transparent syllabus in the hybrid learning implementation. © 2019 IEEE.","conventional learning; hybrid learning; language learning performance; reading and listening skills","Computers; Classroom settings; English languages; Experimental approaches; Experimental groups; Face-to-face learning; Hybrid learning approach; Learning performance; Quantitative research; Computer science",,,,,,"Alebaikan, R., Troudi, S., Blended learning in saudi universities: Challenges and perspectives (2010) ALT-J Research in Learning Technology, 18 (1), pp. 49-59; Gomez, J., Igado, M., Blended learning: The key to success in a training company (2008) International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning, 5 (8); Eddy, L.J., Nor-Aziah, A., Jasmine, J., Blended learning: Examining concepts and practices (2014) Blended & Flipped Learning: Case Studies in Malaysian HEIs, E.

Lexical quality is multidimensional, thus it cannot be evaluated as a single indicator but rather through a composite of diverse factors that, while distinct, are interrelated. It covers lexical density, diversity, and sophistication. The specific objective of this study was to characterize, using a comprehensive set of indicators, the quality of vocabulary produced by two different proficiency levels of 150 undergraduate students: intermediate and upper−intermediate. Qualitative method was used in this reseach. The method of data collection included textual analysis from the samples of students' written argumentative texts as the primary data that had been collected chronologically consisting 75 texts from elementary students and other 75 from upper−intermediate students. The results showed that learners at the lower level surprisingly used more percentage of advanced words than those students at the higher level. This implied that high learners' proficiency level did not lead to improvement in lexical sophistication. © 2019 Asian E F L Journal Press.

In addition, the participants enjoyed doing the peer assessment because of its immediate feedbacks and stimulation to produce better videos. In contrast to the benefits, the participants' experienced challenges, like confusion of assessing projects in diverse platforms. These results signify that the peer assessments are applicable for online learning to trigger students' motivation. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Feedback; Online learning; Peer-assessment; Platform; Video","Feedback; Students; Immediate feedbacks; Online learning; Peer assessment; Platform; Qualitative approach; Undergraduate students; Video; Video contents; E-learning",,,,,,"(2017) Number of Internet Users in Indonesia from 2015 to 2022, , https://www.statista.com/statistics/254456/number-ofinternet-users-in-indonesia, July Retrieved February 21, 2018; Mueller, J., (2008) What Is Authentic Assessment, , http://jonathan.mueller.faculty.noctrl.edu/toolbox/whatisit.htm, Retrieved April 9, 2009; Jonassen, D.H., (2000) Computers as Mindtools for Schools: Engaging Critical Thinking, , Columbus, US: Prentice-Hall; Norman, D.A., (1993) Things that Make Us Smart: Defending Human Attributes in the Age of the Machine, , Cambridge, US: Perseus Publishing; Buckingham Shum, S.J., MacLean, A., Bellotti, V.M.E., Hammond, N.V., Graphical argumentation and design cognition (1997) Human-Computer Interaction, 12, pp. 267-300; Suthers, D.D., Towards a systematic study of representational guidance for collaborative learning discourse (2001) Journal of Universal Computer Science, 7, pp. 254-277; Löhner, S., Van Joolingen, W., Savelsbergh, E.R., The effect of external representation on constructing computer models of complex phenomena (2003) Instructional Science, 31, pp. 395-418; Collis, B., De-Boer, W., Slotman, K., Feedback for web-based assignments (2001) Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 17, pp. 306-313; Sherman, R.C., Using the world wide web to teach everyday applications of social psychology man, R.

This study sought to answer the following question: How do the learners transfer L1 to the acquisition of L2 (English) linguistic item, particularly in lexical choice? The study objective is to describe the types of lexical errors. Therefore, it was a cross-sectional qualitative case study. The result is five types of lexical errors cover misspellings, borrowings, calque, misselection and semantic confusion. According to their source, borrowing and calque are from mother tongue. Misspellings, misselection, and semantic confusion are from target language. Lexical errors imply a lack of lexical knowledge and an inadequate use of vocabulary. Besides, they contribute negatively to communicative quality. Overall, the findings highlight the complexity of L1 influence during foreign language acquisition. However, the study does provide insights regarding the nature of L1 influence in English writing, particularly the lexical choice. Most importantly, the study shows that in some cases, L1 influence continues to play a role throughout writing. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,"Cenoz, J., Jessner, U., (2000) English in Europe: The Acquisition of A Third Language; Wood, A., (2001) Research Perspectives on English for Academic Purposes, , Wood A ed J.

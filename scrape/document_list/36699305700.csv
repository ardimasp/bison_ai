An interpretivist paradigm adopted here consisted of the Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique, which allowed the investigation on behavior development and interest among gastronomes and depict their typology. Findings revealed three stages of the development process which are labelled as (a) novice, (b) learner, and (b) expert to symbolize the different stages of development in food exploring of gastronomes over time. The typology with characteristics of gastronomes in different stages offers researchers and marketers an appealing way to think about the change in leisure participation. Results revealed that the value of participating in this activity is not merely not only to gain novel sensory experiences but also to actively seek for positive feelings and ideas that gastronomes associate with food exploring. The results reported here offer new insights for food tourism strategies in management and marketing. © The Author(s) 2020.","food exploring; gastronomes; interview; typology; ZMET",,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., Kumar, V., Day, G.S., (2003) Marketing research, , 7th ed., Wiley; Akdag, G., Guler, O., Dalgic, A., Benli, S., Cakici, A.C., Do tourists’ gastronomic experiences differ within the same geographical region?

The importance of food tourism as an alternative tourism to promote sustainability for Bali has not been fully explored in terms of visitors’ point-of-view; therefore, the knowledge about satisfaction of tourists about food experience is still in its initial stages. This research aims to explore the satisfaction of international tourists and asses if food has the potential to be used as an alternative to promote sustainable tourism. Design – Besides the theoretical implication of this research regarding tourism industry in Indonesia, this study also gives practical application into the matter of tourism industry in Indonesia. Methodology-This research applied a quantitative method where self-administrated questionnaires were distributed among 150 participants. Some statistical analysis such as factor analysis, multiple linear regression and descriptive analysis were used to analyze the data. Findings-The finding of analysis showed that “environment” and “serving” were significant factors that affected the satisfaction of tourists. The findings have implications for food tourism management and marketing strategies in order to promote sustainable tourism in 3s destinations. Originality-This study was one of the few to assess the role of food as an alternative tourism in 3S destination. © 2020, ASERS Publishing House.

Findings: The findings of the multiple linear regression analysis showed that “heritage” and “ingredients” were significant factors that affected the overall satisfaction of tourists. Results imply that destinations can have differentiated themselves through using their unique foods.

As well as to determine the effect of personal and environmental factors on children's intention to consume milk and its comparison between rural and urban area of Selangor. A total of 389 of 5th grade primary school children were selected in this study. This research was supported by social cognitive theory. Multiple linear regression, Pearson product-moment correlation, and cross-tabulation were used for forecasting the factors affecting to consumption of milk. It was found that the preferred beverages of children were: Mineral water, Milo, fruit juice, milk, yoghurt, Ribena, tea and soft drinks and it was the same amongst children in urban and rural areas. Among different types of milk, children preferred flavored milk rather than plain milk. Based on the findings, personal factors were more effective than environmental factors. To increase milk intake among children, marketers need to focus and strengthen the acceptability of milk and increase consumption by altering perception of milk advertisements. This article also profiled the children who are likely to drink milk based on personal and environmental factors in different areas. © 2010.","Malaysia; Milk consumption; Preference; Rural; Urban",,,,,,"Alden, D.L., Steenkamp, J.B.E.M., Batra, R., Consumer attitudes toward market place globalization: Structure, antecedents and consequences (2007) International Journal of Research Marketing, 23, pp. 227-239; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: The exercise of control, , New York: Freeman; Belk, R.W., Bahn, K.D., Mayer, R.N., Developmental recognition of consumer symbolism (1982) Journal of Consumer Research, 9 (1), pp. 4-17; Charles, P., Calcium absorption and calcium bioavailability (1992) Journal of Internal Medicine, 231, pp. 161-168; Charlet, B., Henneberry, S.R., (2002) A profile of food consumption trends and changing market institutions, , Oklahoma State University Publication: Oklahoma; Chaudhari, C., Marathe, M., International Marketing Conference on Marketing and Society (1997) Paper presented at the meeting of the International Marketing Conference on Marketing and Society, , Pune; Churchill, G.A., Brown, T.J., (2007) Basic Marketing Research, , 6th edition.

At the end of 2018, the number of users of one of the electronic wallet applications reached 115 million. Based on this, this study aims to determine what factors affect the user's interest in using electronic wallet technology in Indonesia. The UTAUT method is used as a theoretical basis that examines Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Facilitating Conditions, Behavior Intention, Use Behavior and other moderation variables. Data collection was obtained as many as 432 respondents spread across several provinces in Indonesia namely DKI Jakarta, East Java, North Sumatra, South Sulawesi and Bali. Processing of research data obtained using SPSS 24 statistical applications. The results of this study indicate that the Effort Expectancy variable is a major factor influencing public interest in using electronic wallet technology. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

(2) Rate of change, customers request more frequent release cycles to compensate for changes in information and service requirements. (3) Quality of change, Increased application scalability. For that reason, IT organizations in making business changes need to do what needs to be modular in developing applications and deployments. Architectural Microservices (MSA) is an alternative architecture in building an application. The MSA conversion process can start patterns that are adapted to future needs. The release cycle is carried out by implementing automation for continuous delivery and continuous integration into continuous development, transforming data services into service forms, so as to answer the challenges of digital transformation. In this paper explains how to transform architects and their design in the E-Procurement application system using MSA. © BEIESP.","And E-Procurement; Architecture; Cloud Computing; Microservices; SOA",,,,,,"Overcoming Ongoing Digital Transformational Challenges with a Microservices Architecture (2015) Cogniz, pp. 1-9. , 20-20 Insights, no. november; (2019) Microservices, , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices; Lestari, W.P., Sujarwo, A., DevOps: Disrupsi Pengelolaan ICT Pendidikan Tinggi (2018) Semin.

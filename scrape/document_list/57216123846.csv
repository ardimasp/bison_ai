The optimiziation of risk based project scheduling can reduce the risks. Risk management can be optimized with combining some methods, such as Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Critical Path Method (CPM) and Crashing Project method. The combination of these methods are used to do the data analysis in order to reduce the project total duration. Based on analysis using FMEA, FTA, CPM and crashing project method, the total of project duration can be reduced from 499 days to 489 days with Rp. 6.822.472,- as the additional cost of workers. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Crashing Project method; Critical Path Method; Failure Mode and Effect Analysis; Fault Tree Analysis","Critical path analysis; Offshore oil well production; Offshore pipelines; Risk assessment; Risk management; Turnaround time; Additional costs; Critical path method; Failure mode and effect analysis; Fault tree analyses (FTA); Project delays; Project duration; Project methods; Project scheduling; Fault tree analysis",,,,,"Kerzner, H., (2009) Project Management: A System Appraoch to Planning, Scheduling, and Control; Kabirifar, K., Mojtahedi, M., The Impact of Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) Phases on Project Performance: A Case of Large-scale Residential Construction Project (2019) Journal of Buildings, 9, pp. 2-15; Steinberg, H.M., (2017) Understanding and Negotiating EPC Contracts Volume 1: The Project Sponsor's Perspective; Sholeh, M.N., Fauziyah, S., Wibowo, M., Kristiani, F., Analisis Proses Pengadaan Material Proyek Konvensional dan Proyek Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) (2014) Jurnal Karya Ilmiah Teknik Sipil, 3, pp. 1149-1160; Yasin, I., (2014) Kontrak Konstruksi di Indonesia; (2013) A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) - Fifth Edition, , Project Management Institute; (2019) Jaringan Dokumentasi Dan Informasi Hukum Lembaga Kebijakan Pengadaan Barang/Jasa Pemerintah, , https://jdih.lkpp.go.id/regulation/peraturan-presiden/peraturan-presiden-nomor-16-tahun-2018, (Agustus 20) JDIH LKP.

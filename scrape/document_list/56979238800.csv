The research objective is to implement an synchronization algorithm which is able to maintain consistency of data owned by different databases through web service, so that data is always up to date. In this study, the implementation will describe the difference of data synchronization algorithm between unidirectional synchronization with bidirectional synchronization in different device through Web Service so users can still use the same data although using a different device. The implementation also adding additional information called as a marker to decide whether the data is need to ignore or synchronized to another database. © 2015 The Authors.

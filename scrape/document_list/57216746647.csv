One of the solutions to solve this problem is to reduce the use of disposable plastic-based items and use green products-stainless straw is one example of green products. Social media could be the right choice to educate society, to create a high environmental awareness that will affect consumption patterns and attitudes towards the environment, it can be a variable that reinforces or weakens the relationship between each variable on buying interest as a dependent variable. This study aims to analyse the effect of green products and environmental attitudes and social media marketing as a moderating variable on willingness to buy. All results showed positive and significant, except for the moderating effect of social media marketing, which showed that the results were not proven to be adequate between the environmental attitude and willingness to buy. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Environmental attitude; Green product; Social media marketing; Willingness to buy",,,,,,"Ajzen, I., (2005) Attitudes, personality and behavior (Second edition), , https://doi.org/10.3109/01421599109089905, Maidenhead, England: Open University Press; Albino, V., Balice, A., Dangelico, R.M., (2009) Environmental Strategies and Green Product Development: An Overview on Sustainability-Driven Companies, 96, pp. 83-96; Ali, A., Khan, A.A., Ahmed, I., Shahzad, W., Determinants of Pakistani consumers' green purchase behavior: Some insights from a developing country (2011) International Journal of Business and Social Science, 2 (3), pp. 217-226; Assaad, W., Gómez, J.M., In social network marketing (social media marketing) opportunities and risks (2011) International Journal of Managing Public Sector Information and Communication Technologies (IJMPICT), 2 (1), p. 13; Azad, P.K., Laheri, V.K., Consumer Adoption of Green Products and Their Role in Resource Management (2014) Indian Journal of Commerce & Management, 5 (3), pp. 22-28. , https://search.proquest.com/openview/0e02b9ee4a88c378f4176d31f123e13e/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2032143; Bashar, A.B.U., Ahmad, I., Wasiq, M., Effectiveness of Social Media as a Marketing Tool: An Empirical Study (2012) International Journal of Marketing, Financial Services & Management Research, 1 (11), pp. 88-99; Bhatia, M., Ahmedbad, Jain, A., Green Marketing: A Study of Consumer Perception and Preferences in India (2013) Electronic Green Journal, 36 (1), pp. 217-220. , https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2011.5.6700; Cai, F., Bagchi, R., Gauri, D.K., Boomerang effects of low-price Discounts: Discounts Affect How low-price purchase propensity (2016) Journal of Consumer Research, 42 (5), pp. 804-816. , https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucv057; Chekima, B., Khalid Wafa, S.A.W.S., Igau, O.A., Chekima, S., Determinant factors of consumers' green purchase intention: The moderating role of environmental advertising (2015) Asian Social Science, 11 (10), pp. 318-329. , https://doi.org/10.5539/ass.v11n10p318; Chi, H.-H., Interactive Digital Advertising vs (2013) Virtual Brand Community.

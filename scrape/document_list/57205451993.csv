Furthermore, this study also explores the millennials’ perception towards digital technology adoption for museum. Taman Mini Indonesia Indah website was employed to remark the research object. Hence, 18 museums were finalized as of this research object. Data was accumulated through direct field observation in all museums and interview with museum staff. Meanwhile, a survey with questionnaire was distributed to gather the digital technology and accessible information perception of the museum. Also, other accessibility information data was gathered through content analysis. The findings reveal accessible information compliance in term of printed material, digital document, audio visual content, website, application, self-service terminal, and signage. Findings also show that Museum Olahraga turns out to be the most compliance regarding its accessible information and providing digitalization facilities such as interactive digital signage, augmented reality, interactive video mapping, automatic display slider, interactive kiosk, and interactive light show. However, the result shows that only several museums comply with digital context. This research implication is to deliver the best practice for the museum to anticipate future trends to ensure better experiences for the visitors. © 2020 by ASERS® Publishing.

This paper used a quantitative method. A survey questionnaire was used as primary data source. A sample of 313 respondents were obtained from four educational institutions in Jabodetabek area. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistic and comparing means. The results show that the majority of Gen Z travel for spending their spare time leisurely. Upon choosing the hotel, Gen Z prefer local brands rather than international brands. Online travel agent are the main source for Gen Z to look up hotel information and to make a booking. The results also revealed that different Gen Z demographics lead to different hotel attribute preferences. Gen Z who are currently mainly in high school, diplomates, or studying for a bachelor's degree, considered cleanliness as the most important attribute. While, security and safety was considered important only for high school and bachelor's students. Meanwhile, according to place of origin, all Gen Z showed different degrees of attributes perception. This research provides recommendations for the hotel industry to better understand that different generations lead to different choices of hotel attributes. Therefore, to be able to accommodate this upcoming market, hotels must comply with each generational preference. Hotel's then, must also consider the channel and media that are mostly chosen by Gen Z and the way Gen Z prefer to be contacted. Joint cooperation with online travel agents is also one of the best ways to promote a hotel. © 2020 AJHTL /Author/s.","Generation z; Hotel attributes; Hotel preferences; Tourist behavior",,,,,,,"Baruca, P.Z., Čivre, Z., How do guests choose a hotel?

With many tourists, both local and foreign, visiting tourism areas in Indonesia, will likely always bring more income to the country. With more and more people traveling and most of them having special needs, such as the elderly, young children, pregnant women, people with permanent and temporary disabilities, it is important that tourism objects must be fulfilling the standard from UNWTO concerning the idea that tourism must be felt by everyone or what is known as 'Tourism for All', including information dissemination. In the tourism industry information can be a determinant factor whether a tourist who comes to a tourist destination will feel satisfied or not. Through the information, all things about attractions can be conveyed to prospective visitors or visitors. Therefore, this study aims to determine the extent to which Taman Mini Indonesia Indah implements accessible information for tourism. In this study using descriptive qualitative methods, the primary data was obtained through field research during the period of January-March 2019. The results obtained are an overall picture of the information available in each tourist attraction at Taman Mini Indonesia Indah which is explained into seven categories, namely: printed material, digital document, audiovisual content, websites, apps, cell-service terminals, and signage. The overall conclusion is that Taman Mini Indonesia Indah still needs to improve the accessible information made available for tourism according to desired standards so that it complies with the standards of the UNWTO. This is especially for the apps and self-service terminal categories. It is expected that if accessible information for tourism is increased, visitors to the Taman Mini Indonesia Indah will increase, especially the number of visitors from abroad and this is important for tourism sustainability. © 2019 AJHTL.","Accessible information; Disabilities; Taman mini Indonesia Indah; Tourism; Tourist destination",,,,,"Binus University","This research acknowledges for Bina Nusantara University Grant Research 2019 and another researcher in the same field.","Adiati, M.P., Lestari, N.S., Wiastuti, R.D., (2018) Public parks as urban tourism in Jakarta, , Medan, IOP Publisher; Altinay, Z., The Role of Social Media Tools: Accessible Tourism for Disabled Citizens (2016) Journal of Educational Technology & Society, 19 (1), pp. 89-99; Buj, C., (2010) Paving the Way to Accessible Tourism.

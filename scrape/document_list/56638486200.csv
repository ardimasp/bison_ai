Threrefore the method of steganography is made for hiding information in some medium in such a way that the medium seemingly is not contained a piece of information when it seen by human eyes. One of the steganography methods is Pixel Value Differencing (PVD). PVD is inserting message byte into the difference in bytes of the applied medium. This steganography use the modified PVD with some modification. The modification will be carried out on the pixel pick up pattern using spiral pattern to form pixel pair. It will make the message extraction become more difficult. Based on Peak Signal to Noise Ratio(PSNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE) calculation, The results of this study and survey show that using method of Spiral PVD, the quality of the produced image is relatively good.The image before and after message insertion process has relatively same quality. It is clearly evident in the image of “Ungu Cahaya” based on survey as well as MSE and PSNR calculation is proved that it has good quality after message insertion. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT & LLS.

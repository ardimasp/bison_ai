This research aims to determine the Event Organizer integrated with e-commerce such as Tokopedia, Bukalapak, Blibli, Lazada and Shopee, so that it can be accessed by customers and vendors providing event needs easily. Some factors that influence customer behavior so that they are interested in using Event Organizer services are by using Perceived Value, Service Quality, User Satisfaction, Trust, and Purchase Intention variables. This research produces several hypotheses that will illustrate the interrelationship between variables and the effect on variables. The hypothesis will be validated using an online survey involving 100 respondents. The results of the questionaire will be tested using SmartPLS software so that it is accurate. This research shows that many factors influence customers in deciding to use Event Organizer services. The results showed that the influence of trust has a positive effect on purchase intention. © 2019 IEEE.","E-Commerce; Event Organizer; Perceived Value; Purchase Intention; Service Quality; Trust; User Satisfaction","Customer satisfaction; Electronic commerce; Information systems; Information use; Purchasing; Software testing; Surveys; Customer behavior; Online surveys; Perceived value; Professional-service providers; Purchase intention; Questionaire; Service Quality; User satisfaction; Sales",,,,,"Kotler, P., Keller, L.K., (2009) Manajemen Pemasaran, , edisi 13, Jakarta: Erlangga; Fandy, T., (2004) Strategi Pemasaran, , Edisi II, Yogyakarta: Andi; Parasuraman, V.Z., Berry, L., A conceptual model of service quality and implication for future research (1985) Journal of Marketing, 49, pp. 41-50. , (Fall); Frost, F., Kumar, M., Service quality between internal customers and internal suppliers in an international airline (2001) International Journal of Quality&Reliability Management; Rust, R.T., Oliver, R.L., (1994) Service Quality: Insights and Managerial Implications from the Frontier, Service Quality: New Directions in Theory and Practice, pp. 1-19. , Eds.

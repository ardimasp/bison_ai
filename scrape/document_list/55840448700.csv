However, such studies tend to overlook on data and numbers rather than grounded and contextual turn. The present study used a contextual and qualitative analysis to investigate the identities and realities of university graduates through recurring themes and patterns in Twitter. Data for this case study was a corpus compiled from 345 tweets of 35 Twitter accounts of graduates from English Department in a private university in Indonesia. The corpus contained 4, 966 tokens and was analyzed using AntConc.3.5.8 (2019) for the recurring lexical use and collocations. Results showed that university graduates posed themselves as personally engaged, while formal addressing was used in rhetorical style. The graduates were also embalmed with issues related to work, parenting, marriage, and the current pandemic. The corpus also revealed the commonly collegiate style. The use of code-mixing between Indonesian and English in the tweets also further revealed the shared identity of the graduates. It could be concluded that social media postulated the lives and world of graduates and qualitative study of big data analysis could bring more comprehensive results. Implications for educators and university administrators in preparing students for life after university were included in the discussion. © 2020 IEEE.","Big data; Graduates; Identity; Twitter","Big data; Information management; Code-mixing; Indonesia; Qualitative analysis; Qualitative study; Social media; University graduates; Social networking (online)",,,,,,"Cammaerts, B., Social media and activism (2015) Journal of American College Health Publications, 31, pp. 1-8; Felt, M., Social media and the social sciences: How researchers employ big data analytics (2016) Big Data & Society January-June, pp. 1-15; McCormick, T.H., Lee, H., Ceare, N., Shojaie, N., Spiro, E.S., Using twitter for demographic and social science research: Tools for data collection and processing (2015) Sociological Methods & Research, pp. 1-32; Sebei, H., Taieb, M.A.H., Aouicha, M.B., Review of social media analytics process and big data pipeline (2018) Social Network Analysis and Mining, 8, pp. 30-42; Sivarajaha, U., Irania, Z., Guptab, S., Mahroofa, K., Role of big data and social media analytics for business to business sustainability: A participatory web context (2019) Industrial Marketing Management, pp. 2-20. , April; Gutiérrez-Martín, A., Torrego-González, A., The twitter games: Media education, popular culture and multiscreen viewing in virtual concourses (2017) Information, Communication & Society; Noll, M., Technology and the future of the university: A sober view (2000) Information, Communication & Society, 3 (4), pp. 645-647; Armstrong, L., A new game in town: Competitive higher education (2001) Information, Communication & Society, 4 (4), pp. 479-506; Fleming, F., College students' alcohol displays on facebook: Intervention considerations (2012) Journal of American College Health, 60 (5), pp. 388-394; Bennett, L., Segerberg, A., The logic of connective action (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 739-768; Allen, K.A., Ryan, T., Gray-DeLeon, A., McInerenet, D., Waters, L., Social media use and social connectedness in adolescents: The positives and the potential pitfalls (2014) Australian Journal of Educational and Developmental Psychology, 31 (1), pp. 18-31; Jackson, M.H., McDowell, S.D., Enhancing discourse on new technology within higher education (2000) Information, Communication & Society, 3 (4), pp. 629-638; Brown, M.E., Dustman, P.A., Juan, J.B., Twitter impact on a community trauma: An examination of who, what, and why it radiated (2020) Community Psychology, 1, pp. 1-16; Puschmann, C., Burgess, J., (2014) The Politics of Twitter Data, pp. 43-54. , K.

As the meaning of property is extended to include the virtual property, it should be treated with the same legal status as real-world property. Therefore, it is reasonable that the virtual property as an object of property can be used as collateral for a loan because it does not only give the rights to peaceful enjoyment but also provides security interest. Under Article 9 Uniform Commercial Code, eSnowshoes, a United States-based company, uses its domain name and storefront in a virtual world called Second Life to secure financing. By comparing Indonesian legal framework to the United States legal framework for the virtual property and security law, this article discusses the possibility for the virtual property to be used as collateral for a loan in Indonesian legal system. In this digital era, granting users property rights on the virtual property will promote economic growth. However, some developers are still enforcing Terms of Service and End-User License Agreement that restrict users from owning virtual property they have made in the virtual world. The clarity of the ownership of the virtual property is needed as only eligible subjects capable to use their property as collateral for a loan. Also, it must be clear what type of property that the virtual property belongs to. While the United States enacts Article 9 Uniform Commercial Code for personal property and fixture, the Indonesian legal system recognizes pledge and fiduciary as a security interest for the movable property. Acknowledging the virtual property as the movable intangible property is the most practical way to do for it to be able to be used as collateral for a loan under Law No. 42 of 1999 on Fiduciary because the perfection for it does not need to meet inbezitstelling principle. However, the usage of the virtual property as collateral for a loan is needed to be discussed further by the economic and financing experts on how to assess its value. The method used in this research is descriptive analysis, carried out through expert interviews, regulation, literature studies and normative juridical. © 2020 Little Lion Scientific.

It is aired both on the national television, as well as pay-tv aired in various countries. In 2016, Indonesia was ranked 47 out of 144 countries. The purpose of this study was to find the symbolic meaning of wonderful Indonesia version of A Visual Journey through Banyuwangi. It aims to examine connotative and denotative meaning contained in the advertisement. The identity of Indonesian, culture and philosophy is reflected in the advertisement. Semiotic analysis of Roland Barthes who claimed that social life is a sign of its own system was adopted as a research method. Data was collected through observations and interviews to complete the analysis. The results showed that the video “A Visual Journey through Banyuwangi TVC” contained denotative and connotative meaning. Denotative meaning refers to depiction of Banyuwangi in East Java, such as waterfalls, traveling to there, the uniqueness of natural stone and see the activities of tourists and local people in their daily activities. While the connotative meanings are attributed to Indonesian culture and philosophy, such as humble and harmony. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Banyuwangi; Symbolic meaning; TVC; Visual journey",,,,,,,"(2016) Banyuwangi Tourism, , http://www.eastjava.com/tourism/banyuwangi/ijen-crater.html, August 8).

The focus is to discover how communication used by Radio Taiwan International (RTI) for Indonesian citizen can build a good image for governments. The result of this study shows: First, image building through radio broadcasting for governments can be done through the role of radio as a medium of communication between the government and local communities. Second, the method of delivering the message for female radio listeners is a two-way communication in which the broadcaster has to prepare direct conversation with the listeners or provide time to speak directly as a friend in the real world. Third, radio programmes that are ethnically coloured are an effective form of radio programme for citizens abroad that supports image building. The conclusion of this study is that image building through radio can be done for female Indonesian citizens in Taiwan because radio as a medium of socialisation works as two-way communication and it can be ethnically coloured. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Image building; Indonesian; Radio Taiwan International",,,,,,,"Anderson, P.J., Egglestone, P., The development of effective quality measures relevant to the future practice of BBC news journalism online (2012) Journalism Sage Journal, 13 (7), pp. 923-941; (2012) Kian Banyak Wanita Indonesia Jadi Pengantin Asing di Taiwan, , http://www.antaranews.com/berita/1141877923/kian-banyak-wanita-indonesia-jadi-pengantin-asing-di-taiwan, Retrieved December 21, 2012, from; Conway, B., Cahill, L.M., Corcoran, M.P., The 'miracle' of Fatima: Media framing and the regeneration of a Dublin housing estate (2012) Journalism Sage Journals, 13 (5), pp. 551-571; Field, S., (2009) Carrer Opportunities in Radio, , New York: Infobase Publishing; (2012) Rangkaian Kunjungan Menteri Tenaga Kerja Dan Transmigrasi Dan Rombongan Ke Taiwan Untuk Peningkatan Kesejahteraan TKI, , http://kdei-taipei.org/id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=411:rangkaian-kunjungan-menteri-tenaga-kerja-dan-transmigrasi-dan-rombongan-ke-taiwan-untuk-peningkatan-kesejahteraan-tki&catid=34:berita&Itemid=55, Retrieved December 12, 2012, from; Ma, E.K., Compressed modernity in south China (2010) Global Media and Communication, 8 (3), pp. 289-308; (2001) Jurnalistik Radio: Menata Profesionalisme Reporter Dan Penyiar, , Masduki.

Informants consisted of the therapists (TCM physicians), patients and the government in the health field. In this study, the actions are the behavior of the actors constructed in TCM, which is measured through therapists and the actions of TCM patients in Beijing and Jakarta. The results shows that appropriate communication, supported by accurate evidence will facilitate and perpetuate the acceptance of TCM for Indonesians to go to Beijing or Jakarta. Bombardment of mass communication of TCM has increased the awareness for the presence of TCM in Jakarta, but also became a boomerang for TCM image overall. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

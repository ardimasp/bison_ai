The nature of the work in some industries are more risky compared to other industries, and oil& gas Company is one of them especially for their field worker. Actually, most of company is very strict in safety supervision because the consequences can be fatal, however som accidents may still experience by workers. The company is not only concern about the safety but also set high performance and productivity on their employee. Employee awareness of how important of those three factors could help company to achieve the goal. In this study, how performance, productivity, safety and health at workplace perceived by operator and supervisor/manager at oil & gas company in Qatar is discussed, and their correlation was measured. A questionnaire consist of 45 questions related to performance, productivity, safety and health, was applied to caputer the perception of oil & gas company's employee who located at 4 sites. There are 212 participants involved in the survey (155 operators, and 57 supervisors/manager). Based on their answer, the study showed that performance and productivity level of the employee can be categorize as high (82% and 85%), while the safety and health level at the company is perceived in good condition (by 86% employee). Using multiple linear regression, significant correlation productivity and performance with safety and health condition is found (p < 0.05). In addition, Two Way ANOVA conducted to see the differences perception among age group and years-of-duty group. It revealed the differences exist based on p<0.1. This study showed that employee for each site (Dukhan, Ras Laffan, Doha, and Offshore Umm Said) realizes how the importance of performance, productivity, and safety in work even though the perception may differ among the group. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

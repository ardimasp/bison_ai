This note shows that the source of funds circulating in the Indonesia Stock Exchange is related to excess liquidity resulting from the policy of quantitative easing (QE) by developed countries’ central banks. Banks funding assets with debt results in leverage relationships with the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) negatively affected. Thus it is evident that the Indonesian banking strategy is “reactive” and is influenced by external factors. External factors can be influenced by global issues as well as internal (enterprise performance) issues. Therefore foreign and global issues may be important (perhaps dominant) in determining the perceptions of the Indonesian stock market. © 2015 Australasian Accounting Business and Finance Journal and Authors.","Bank; Indonesian stock exchange; Quantitative easing",,,,,,"Albanese, C., Li, D., Lobackeskiy, E., Meissner, G., (2011) A Comparative Analysis of Correlation Approaches in Finance, , Social Science Research Network, February; Allen, F., Santomero, A.M., The Theory of Financial Intermediation (1997) Journal of Banking & Finance, 21 (11-12), pp. 1461-1485. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0378-4266(97)00032-0, December 1997; Allen, F., Gale, D., Competition and Financial Stability (2004) Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, 36 (3). , http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/mcb.2004.0038, The Ohio State University Press; Angora, A., Roulet, C., (2011) Transformation Risk and Its Determinants: A New Approach Based on the Basel III Liquidity Management Framework, , Université de Limoges, LAPE; Arora, A., (2013) Ownership Effects on Credit Risk, 10 (3); Aspachs, O., Nier, E., Tiesset, M., (2005) Liquidity, Banking Regulation, and the Macroeconomy, , www.bis.org/bcbs/events/rtf05AspachsNierTiesset.pdf, Evidence on Bank Liquidity Holdings from a Panel of UK-resident Banks, presentation at BIS; Baltagi, B.H., Liu, L., (2009) ""A Note on the Application of EC2SLS and EC3SLS Estimators in Panel Data Models"", , http://surface.syr.edu/cpr/50, Center for Policy Research.

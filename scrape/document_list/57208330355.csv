There are two objectives of this study (1) to explore awareness of corporate reputation in 4-star and 5-star hotels; (2) to examine corporate efforts to gain corporate reputation in 4-star to 5-star hotels. The hotels studied are Grand Aston Yogyakarta (5-star hotel) and Swiss-Belinn Makassar Hotel (4-star hotel). The research uses a descriptive qualitative method; data was collected using semi-structured interviews and virtual observation. Results showed that both hotels are aware of corporate reputation in the service industry, and have implemented Grunig’s two-way asymmetrical model. However, both hotels do not have a particular strategy and seem to be overwhelmed with the information in social media. Each hotel needs to implement social media policy and strategy to gain insight into stakeholders’ feedbacks and current trends. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Corporate Reputation; Reputation awareness; Service companies",,,,,,"Barnett, M.L., Jermier, J.M., Lafferty, B.A., Corporate reputation: The definitional landscape (2006) Corporate Reputation Review, 9 (1), pp. 26-38; Bennet, R., Kottasz, R., Practitioner perceptions of corporate reputation: An empirical investigation (2000) Corporate Communications: An International Journal, 5 (4), pp. 224-235; Caesar, L.A.Y., Performance excellence by transformational leadership in developing collectivistic culture for Indonesian companies (2016) Pertanika Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities, 24 (S), pp. 19-32; Davies, G., Chun, R., Kamins, M., Reputation gaps and the performance of service organizations (2010) Strategic Management Journal, pp. 530-546; Daymon, C., Holloway, I., (2002) Qualitative Research Methods in Public Relations, , London: Routledge; Denzin, N.K., Lincoln, Y.S., (2011) The SAGE Handbook of Qualitative Research, , Eds 4th ed.).

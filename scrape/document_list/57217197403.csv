We always look for all the latest information through books or news. News usually contains tags or categories to make it easier to find similar news. It can be done manually by a human or with a machine to make it easier. Data mining techniques such as clustering and classification can be used to help the categorization process. Clustering is a technique that can be used to grouped news based on their similarity. There is some algorithm that can be used to clustering data. One of them is Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). ACO is a metaheuristic algorithm that mimics how ants bring food to the colony. ACO also can be used to solve the clustering problem. In this paper, we will use the ACO version for clustering to cluster news and find the performance of the said method. Then we compare the result with ground truth. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data mining; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Clustering data; Clustering problems; Ground truth; Meta heuristic algorithm; News clustering; Ant colony optimization",,,,,"Lee, C.S., Ma, L., News sharing in social media: The effect of gratifications and prior experience (2012) Comput Human Behav, 28 (2), pp. 331-339; Suleymanov, U., Rustamov, S., Automated News Categorization using Machine Learning methods (2018) IOP Conf ser Mater Sci Eng, 459, p. 12006; Muflikhah, L., Baharudin, B., (2009) ICCTD 2009-2009 International Conference on Computer Technology and Development, pp. 58-62; Luo, C., Li, Y., Chung, S.M., Text document clustering based on neighbors (2009) Data Knowl Eng, 68 (11), pp. 1271-1288; Dorigo, M., Maniezzo, V., Colorni, A., Ant system: Optimization by a colony of cooperating agents (1996) IEEE Trans Syst Man, Cybern Part B, 26 (1), pp. 29-41; Shelokar, P.S., Jayaraman, V.K., Kulkarni, B.D., An ant colony approach for clustering (2004) Anal Chim Acta, 509 (2), pp. 187-195; Xu, D., Tian, Y., A Comprehensive Survey of Clustering Algorithms (2015) Ann Data Sci, 2 (2), pp. 165-193; Librian, A., Kukuh, R., Sastrawi.

Despite of its high performance, Deep Learning requires a gigantic amount of training data to show its best result. Getting this massive data in reasonable time requires a proper strategy such as crowdsourcing. However, in case of object counting, we found no crowdsourcing system able to effectively collect necessary data. To tackle this problem, we develop a crowdsourcing system to annotate image for object counting dataset. This system is also equipped with validation system to ensure the quality of collected dataset. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Imbalanced nutrition increases risk of health problems. Balanced nutrition means the difference between nutrition needed and nutrition intake must be as minimum as possible. The condition in Indonesian, many people consume food with high carbohydrate; whereas nutrition consists of protein, carbohydrate, and fat. That nutrition obtains from five foods category, namely: main dish (MP), vegetable side dish (LN), meat (LH), vegetable (SY), and fruit (BH). Therefore, it needs a system to provide a suggestion for balanced nutrition. This research used Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) to obtain optimal nutrition, which contains five dimensions (MP, LH, LN, SY, BH). These dimension and variable are represented as food source, which will be optimized by bees. These bees are divided into employee bee (BN), onlooker bee (SN), and scout bee. BN will produce new food source, where if new food source has a better solution, it will replace the old one. SN performers based on the fitness value of each food source; if the food source has high probability, SN will produce new food source. While scout bee will determine a new food source, if the number of trials for releasing a food source is equal to the value of 'limit'. The performance of ABC evaluated using twelve data of men and female. The result shows that ABC achieve 99.90% in giving a recommendation for portion and type of foods a day. © 2016 IEEE.","Artificial Bee Colony; Computational Intelligence; Daily Nutrition; Food Recommendation; Optimization","Artificial intelligence; Carbohydrates; Health risks; Optimization; Vegetables; Artificial bee colonies; Artificial bee colonies (ABC); Fitness values; Food sources; Healthy lifestyles; High probability; Nutrition",,,,,,"Kementrian Kesehatan, R.I., (2010) Badan Penelitian Dan Pengembangan Kesehatan (Balitbang), , Riset Kesehatan Dasar (Riskesdas).

This study combines Adaptive Genetic Algorithm, K-Means and Greedy Selection to solve clustering problem, named RAGKA. In first step, the centroid is determined by K-Means. Crossover and mutation are performed based on the fitness value of each centroid. At last, the greedy search is operated to get the better solution. To show the performance of RAGKA, five data sets of clustering problem are used. Moreover, RAGKA is compared with other methods as well. The result shows that RAGKA is successfully to solve cluster problem and outperforms than the others. © 2016 IEEE.","Adaptive Genetic Algorithm; Clustering; Greedy Selection Introduction; K-Means","Genetic algorithms; Problem solving; Adaptive genetic algorithms; Clustering; Clustering problems; Crossover and mutation; Genetic K-means algorithm; Greedy selections; K-means; Robust adaptive; Clustering algorithms",,,,,,"Guliani, S., (2015) An Enhanced Clustering Algorithm by Comparative Study on K-Means Algorithm, 4 (6), pp. 193-196. , http://dx.doi.org/10.17577/IJERTV4IS060271; Karaboga, D., Ozturk, C., A novel clustering approach: Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) (2011) Algorithm, 11, pp. 652-657. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2009.12.025; Subbalakshmi, C., Rao, P.V., Mohan, S.K., (2014) Performance Issues on K-Mean Partitioning Clustering Algorithm, pp. 41-51; Vora, P., Oza, B., (2013) A Survey on K-mean Clustering and ParticleSwarm Optimization, (3), pp. 24-26; Zhang, C., Ouyang, D., Ning, J., An artificial bee colony approach for clustering (2010) Expert Systems with Applications, 37 (7), pp. 4761-4767. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2009.11.003; Cole, R.M., (1998) Clustering with Genetic Algorithms, , University of Western Australia; Zalik, K.R., (2008) An Efficient K-means Clustering Algorithm, 29, pp. 1385-1391. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.patrec.2008.02.014; Shelokar, P.S., Jayaraman, V.K., Kulkarni, B.D., (2004) An ant colony approach for clustering, 509, pp. 187-195. , (December 2003); Zhao, B.J., An ant colony clustering algorithm (2007) Machine Learning and Cybernetics, 2007 International Conference on, 7, pp. 3933-3938. , August.

""Nutrients Hero"" Game is expected not only entertaining, but also giving knowledge to users. This game will be able to be played on Android devices. ""Nutrients Hero"" Game has 3 kinds of stages: eyes, mouth, and bones; each stage has 2 game sections, named: Food Stage and Tower Defence Stage. At food stage section, players must collect vitamins and minerals from various food sources; if the players choose a wrong food, it will decrease vitamin and mineral bar. Meanwhile at tower defence section, vitamins are the heroes while minerals only affect the number of supplements. Players (heroes) that defense will automatically attack incoming enemies. Each stage has different kind of enemies and total waves. This research has 2 research methods include analysis method (literature review, interview, survey and analysis of similar game) and design methods (scrum method). The result of this research will be evaluated by pre-test and post-tests, which consist of 8 questions about vitamin, mineral, foods, and diseases. © 2017 The Authors.

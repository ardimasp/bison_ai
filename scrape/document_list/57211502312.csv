The design method used is DSDLC (Database System Development Lifecycle). The results achieved in this study are application prototypes in the form of Application Programming Interface (API). This study found the fact that the broad match ad keyword system was based on the ad keyword search feature at PT. XYZ has not been able to search for keywords without regard to the order of the search keywords. Based on this, this study determines the workings of broad match keyword features by applying the search rules broad matching, synonym, and stemming into the existing ad keyword search system. Keyword analysis uses the rules of broad matching, synonym, and stemming. The results can be implemented in the form of ElasticSearch analyzer. © 2018 IEEE.","Application Programming Interface; Broad Match; Elasticsearch Analyzer","Intelligent systems; Life cycle; Product design; Search engines; Advertising systems; Broad Match; Elasticsearch Analyzer; Feature analysis; Keyword search; Product advertisements; Search keyword; System development; Application programming interfaces (API)",,,,,"Arisantoso, H., Dan Saefullah, A., Analisa pengaruh penggunaan search engine optimization (seo) pada website e-commerce (2015) Seminar Nasional Sistem Informasi Indonesia, 1 (1), pp. 33-40; Djuric, N., Wu, H., Radosavljevic, V., Grbovic, M., Bhamidipati, N., Hierarchical neural language models for joint representation of streaming documents and their content (2015) Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 248-255. , May).

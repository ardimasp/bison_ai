In many urban areas, the sport has spurred communities or clubs that not only provide opportunities for its members to play the sport, but also provide a medium for developing sport performance through group rides and activities. Many mobile applications have been developed for activity tracking and providing important metrics while doing sport activities as well as gamification through leaderboards in comparing performance with others. No mobile application, however, has been developed for community based activities where members not only can develop themselves, but also improve the interactions and engagement of group rides. The Bike App as a prototype application was developed for such purposes. The development of the app involved a cycling community based in Jakarta. © 2019 IEEE.","bicycle; gamification; health and fitness; mobile application","Gamification; Mobile computing; Software prototyping; Activity tracking; Community-based; Jakarta; Mobile applications; Sport activities; Sport performance; Urban areas; Sports",,,,,"Hassan, D., (2014) Sport and Communities: An Introduction Sport in Society, 17 (1); Robertson, J., Eime, R., Westerbeek, H., Community sports clubs: Are they only about playing sport, or do they have broader health promotion and social responsibilities (2018) Annals of Leisure Research, pp. 1-18; (2015) Anonymous, , http://www2.jawapos.com/baca/artikel/16723/milagrocyclist-dari-sekadar-kesamaan-hobi-hingga-pembinaan-atlet; Damanpour, F., Phases of the adoption of innovation in organizations: Effects of environment, organization and top managers (2006) British Journal of Management, 17, pp. 215-236. , M.

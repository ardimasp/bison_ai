Thus, instead of prohibiting the use of social media in teaching learning activities, teachers should continuously find a way to integrate its use to enhance students' learning. This paper presents research focused on the students' experience in using the social media platform and their mobile device in communication and learning. The educational objective of this study is to increase students' participation and enhance their use of social media for learning. The data for this study was taken from a questionnaire given to 40 English Department students. Data collected from the questionnaire allowed the researcher to observe the students' engagement in social media. Results showed that students were familiar with social media but they mostly used it for communication, not for learning. However, they also showed their willingness to use the social media in education. A number of implications for students' learning and future research were also discussed. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Engineering education; Social networking (online); Surveys; User experience; Educational objectives; Social media; Social media platforms; Students' engagements; Teaching-learning activities; University students; Students",,,,,"Prensky, M., Digital natives, digital immigrants (2001) On the Horizon, 9, pp. 1-5; Bauman, Z., (2010) Fourty Four Letters from the Liquid Modern World; Kaplan, A., Haenlein, M., Users of the world, the challenges and opportunities of social media (2010) Business Horizons, 53 (1), pp. 59-68; Crook, C., Fisher, T., Harrison, C., Logan, K., Luckin, R., Oliver, M., Sharples, M., (2008) Web 2.0 Technologies for Learning: The Current Landscape-opportunities, Challenges and Tensions; Dabbagh, N., Kitsantas, A., Personal learning environments, social media, and self-regulated learning: A natural formula for connecting formal and informal learning (2012) Internet and Higher Education, 15 (1), pp. 3-8; Lee, M., McLoughlin, C., (2010) Web 2.0-based E-learning; Olutola, A.T., Olatoye, O., Olatoye, R., Assessment of social media utilization and study habit of students of tertiary institution in Katsina state (2016) J.Of Education and Practice, 7, pp. 178-188; Husain, I., Cakir, O., Candeger, U., Social media as a learning technology for university students (2018) Int J.Of Instruction, 11 (2), pp. 281-296; Wenger, E., White, N., Smith, D., (2009) Digital Habitats: Stewarding Technology for Community; Liu, Y., Social media tools as a learning resource (2010) J. of Ed.

In this paper, the writer is using auto ethnography method to compare the efficacy of two language learning apps: Duolingo and Memrise for learning two different foreign languages. Duolingo is used to learn Spanish and Memrise is used to learn Italian. This paper reports the results of learning both languages within the period of two months using the above mentioned language learning apps. Moreover, the writer also discusses the nature of learning, the principles and the challenges of learning foreign languages using mobile devices. 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Thus, assigning stress correctly in English words has been a challenging task for L2 learners, especially Indonesian learners since their L1 does not recognize such stress system. This study explores the production of English word stress by 30 university students. The method used for this study is immediate repetition task. Participants are instructed to identify the stress placement of 80 English words which are auditorily presented as stimuli and immediately repeat the words with correct stress placement. The objectives of this study are to find out whether English word stress placement is problematic for L2 learners and to investigate the phonological factors which account for these problems. Research reveals that L2 learners have different ability in producing the stress, but three-syllable words are more problematic than two-syllable words. Moreover, misplacement of stress is caused by, among others, the influence of vowel lenght and vowel height.","Production; Recognition; Stress placement; Vowel height; Vowel length; Word stress",,,,,,"Alieva, N., Arakin, V., Ogoblin, A., Sirk, Y., (1991) Bahasa Indonesia: Deskripsi dan Teori., , Yogyakarta: Kanisius; Archibald, J., The acquisition of English stress by speakers of nonaccentual languages: Lexical storage versus computation of stress (1997) Linguistics, 3 (1), pp. 167-181; Basri, H., A comparative account of Indonesian and English Stress Patterns: Impacts to the teaching of English to Indonesian students (2010) KOLITA, 8, pp. 345-349. , Jakarta: Atma Jaya; Benrabah, M., Word stress-a source of unintelligibility in English (1997) IRAL, 35 (3), pp. 157-165; Burges, J., Spencer, S., Phonology and pronunciation in integrated language teaching and teacher education (2000) System, 28, pp. 191-215; Carr, P., (1999) English Phonetics and Phonology., , Oxford: Blackwell; Chomsky, N., Halle, M., (1968) The sound pattern of English., , New York : Harper and Row; Clark, J., Yallop, C., (1998) An introduction to phonetics and phonology., , Oxford: Blackwell; Cohn, A., Stress in Indonesian and bracketing paradoxes (1989) Natural Language and Linguistic Theory, 7, pp. 167-216; Coxhead, A., A new academic word list (2000) TESOL Quarterly, 34, pp. 213-238; Dardjowidjojo, S., (2009) English Phonetics and Phonology for Indonesians., , Jakarta: Obor; Derwing, T.M., Evidence in favor of a broad framework for pronunciation instruction (1998) Language Learning : A Journal of Research in Language Studies, 48 (3), pp. 393-410; Flege, J., Bohn, O., Jang, S., Effects of experience on non-native speakers' production and perception of English vowels (1997) Journal of Phonetics, 25, pp. 437-470; Goldsmith, J.A., (1990) Autosegmental and Metrical Phonology, , Oxford: Basil Blackwell; Guion, S., Harada, T., Clark, J., Early and late Spanish-English bilinguals' acquisition of English word stress patterns (2004) Bilingualism: Language and Cognition, 7, pp. 207-226; Hayes, B., (1981) A metrical theory of stress rules.

Similarly, in teaching a foreign language, especially English, teachers also need teaching strategies. Issues related to learners' learning strategies have been discussed over the years; however, issues related to teachers' teaching strategies have not been researched thoroughly. Effective teaching strategies are particularly important for teachers who are teaching big classes in multi channel learning system as applied in Bina Nusantara University. This study has two aims: first, to investigate the teaching strategies employed by Binus English teachers and second, to find out the intersection between teachers and students regarding the teaching strategies employed in the classroom. Using questionnaires for teachers and students, this study examined the frequency of strategy used by students and teachers. The results showed that teachers and students have different opinions on the strategies/activities that occurred in the classroom. The implications of these results for the teaching/learning situation are discussed. © The Author(s) 2011.","Multi channel learning; Perception; Students; Teachers; Teaching strategies",,,,,,"Brown, D., (2006) Principles of Language Learning and Teaching, , New York: Pearson Education; Byrne, D., (1986) Teaching Oral Skill, , Cambridge: Pearson Education Ltd; Byrne, D., (1986) Teaching Oral Skill, , Cambridge: Pearson Education Ltd; Griffith, C., Parr, J.M., Language learning strategies: Theory and perception (2001) ELT Journal, 55 (3); Griffith, C., Language Learning Strategies: Students' and Teachers' Perceptions (2007) ELT Journal Volume 61/2 April 2007, , Oxford University Press; Harmer, J., (2007) The Practice of English Language Teaching (4th edition), , Cambridge: Longman; Hawkey, R., Teacher and learner perception of language learning activity (2006) ELT, 60 (3), pp. 242-249; Ko, S., Rossen, S., (2004) Teaching Online, , Boston : Houghton Mifflin Company; Lewis, M., (1993) The Lexical Approach, , Language Teaching Publication; Nunan, D., (2001) Teaching Methodologies, , Cambridge: Longman; Scrivener, J., PPP and after (1994) The Teacher Trainer 8/1; Willing, K., (1989) Teaching How to Learn: Learning Strategies in ESL.

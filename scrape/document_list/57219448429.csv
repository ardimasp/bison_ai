Our research aims to broaden the insights of businesspeople, regarding how to integrate and manage the benefits of implementing governance risk and compliance. The research method in this research is qualitative research. We use primary data from interviews with informants, besides that we also use secondary data in the form of published research papers and reports related to GRC. The results show that if the company is able to implement GRC effectively, it will have an impact on the company, including being able to predict and analyze possible risks in the future. © 2020 EManuscript Technologies.

This study empirically examines such influences on taxpayers’ perceptions of tax compliance (either voluntary or enforced) in Indonesia after the implementation of a tax amnesty. In 2018, data were collected through a face-to-face questionnaire survey of 410 small business taxpayers and analyzed using a stepwise linear regression model. Trust in government was positively related to agreement with/support of voluntary tax compliance; however, perceptions of government’s power were only marginally significant. Neither trust in government nor perceptions of government’s power influenced taxpayers’ perceptions of enforced tax compliance. These findings partly support the Slippery Slope Framework. This study contributes to the literature on the influence of trust and power on voluntary or enforced tax compliance in developing countries, particularly Asia, after the implementation of a tax amnesty. © The Author(s) 2020.","enforced tax compliance; government’s power; Slippery Slope Framework; trust in the government; voluntary tax compliance",,,,,"Binus University: RT/III/2018, 014/VR","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Bina Nusantara University (Grant 014/VR.RT/III/2018).","Allingham, M.G., Sandmo, A., Income tax evasion: A theoretical analysis (1972) Journal of Public Economics, 1 (3-4), pp. 323-338. , https://doi.org/10.1016/0047-2727(72)90010-2; Alm, J., A perspective on the experimental analysis of taxpayer reporting (1991) The Accounting Review, 66 (3), pp. 577-593; Alm, J., What motives tax compliance?

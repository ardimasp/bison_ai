Algorithm used in this cluster analysis is k-means and the number of cluster (k) is four and the similarity measurement between members of clusters is based on Euclidean distance. The source of data set was taken from Ministry of Tourism portal of Republic of Indonesia per November 2017. The results of this cluster analysis is presented in a table consisting of four clusters and each cluster consists of its members. Cluster analysis in this study can be used more quickly and efficiently to identify countries which will be the promotional and campaign targets on tax-free incentives for foreign tourists assuming a constraint that promotional and campaign budgets are always limited so that the related policy makers need to set a priority on targeted countries. © 2018 IEEE.","cluster analysis; data mining; tax-free","Budget control; Cluster analysis; Data mining; Euclidean distance; Indonesia; International tourisms; Number of clusters; Policy makers; Similarity measurements; tax-free; Tourism portal; Economic analysis",,,,,"Paoli, C., The economic revenues and the emergy costs of cruise tourism (2017) J.

One of the main issues faced by those tourists is that they can not make simple queries to search engines about, for example, which sites or places to visit optimally if we only have one day or two-day visit? Search engines are better and better in replying users' queries with relevant answers. However, search engines are not always able to respond queries suited to users' characteristics such as their styles, personalities, knowledge backgrounds, etc. Also, search engines are not as flexible as chatbots in enabling dialogical-communication-queries. This case study aims to respond aformentioned issue by applying hierarchical cluster analysis on a set of tourism sites around Malang city, Malang regency, and Batu city based on AGNES (Agglomerative Nesting) algorithm. The result, then, is fed into chatbot's knowledge base. This chatbot will assist tourists to get information on which possible sites they have to visit optimally if they are under limited vacancy-Time constraints. © 2018 IEEE.","AGNES algorithm; chatbot; tourism sites","Cluster analysis; Hierarchical systems; Information management; Knowledge based systems; Search engines; Chatbot; Chatbots; Hierarchical cluster analysis; Knowledge base; Time constraints; tourism sites; Clustering algorithms",,,,,"Brooke, S., A travel industry revolution: The chatbots (2017) Chatbots Journal, , https://chatbotsjournal.com/a-Travelindustry-revolution-The-chatbots-1a2468baf78c, [Accessed: 30-Mar-2018]; Han, J., Kamber, M., Pei, J., (2012) Data Mining-Concepts and Techniques 3ed-Jiawei Han, Micheline Kamber Elsevier 2006 772s; Zhao, Y., Karypis, G., Evaluation of hierarchical clustering algorithms for document datasets (2002) Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management-CIKM 02, p. 515; Davidson, I., Ravi, S.S., Agglomerative hierarchical clustering with constraints: Theory and empirical resutls (2005) 9th Eur.

On the other hand, the process of sorting out useful documents from existing documents to generate useful information poses both individual and organizational challenges. This paper presents a model on how to classify by loading documents into Oracle database and using rule-based classification for further action. The result can be classified according to the categories defined and formulated before, stored in the database and making it easier for decision makers. © 2017 IEEE.","Classification; Document; Oracle 12c; rule-based","Database systems; Decision making; Information management; Information retrieval systems; Business companies; Decision makers; Document; Oracle 12c; Oracle database; Rule based; Rule-based classification; Sorting outs; Classification (of information)",,,,,"Bijalwan, V., Kumar, V., Kumari, P., Pascual, J., KNN based machine learning approach for text and document mining (2014) Int.

After 8 years are applied, the author felt the need to do an evaluation of the information systems to identify and measure the success rate of the application/ implementation of the HIS Kasih Group. This study aims to evaluate the system information by using HOT FIT Model. HOT FIT Model has four perspectives namely information systems Human (Human), Organization, Technology and the benefits provided. With all four perspectives is expected to yield an appropriate evaluation to measure the success and influence of HIS implementation. This study will be tested to 213 HIS users by using questionnaires and interviews. The data collection technique is used to assess the effect of each perspective HOT FIT Model. Data will be analyzed quantitatively by using multiple regression. The results showed that 1) the impact on the use of User Satisfaction System, 2) use of the system positively affects user satisfaction. 3) Quality of information is User Satisfaction of positive influence. 4) Quality of Service is positive effect on User Satisfaction. 5) Quality Systems positive effect on Organizational Structure. 6) Quality of Service positive effect on Organizational Structure. 7) Environment Organization positive effect on Organizational Structure. © 2017 IEEE.","Evaluation; HIS; HOT FIT Model; Information Systems","Hospitals; Information management; Information systems; Quality of service; Surveys; Evaluation; Hospital information systems; Hot fits; Multiple regressions; Organizational structures; Quality of information; System information; User satisfaction; Information use",,,,,"Metev, S.M., Veiko, V.P., (1998) Laser Assisted Microtechnology, , 2nd ed., R.

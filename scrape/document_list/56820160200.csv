One of the fastest growing tourism destinations in Indonesia is Lombok. Thus, this study aims to examine the brand equity of Lombok. A consumer-based brand equity concept in the context of place branding was applied in this study. The data was collected from Lombok visitors in May 2013 via a survey questionnaire. Respondents, both domestic and international visitors, were chosen using the convenience sampling method. Descriptive analysis and a one-sample t-test were used to analyze the data. This study found that there are statistical differences of brand awareness, brand image, perceived quality of, and loyalty to, Lombok as a tourism destination, thus the respondents’ visit to Lombok influenced their awareness, image perception, perceived quality of, and loyalty to, Lombok. Meanwhile, mean value differences among variables addressed different insights from each dimension of Lombok brand equity. Despite of its small number of respondents, this study provides the insight of a preliminary project for branding Lombok. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

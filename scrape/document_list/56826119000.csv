The purpose of this research is to analyze the service strategy management information system at the State Attorney of ABC, also to give suggestion for system improvement, in order to achieve a good service quality. The method used in this research is the Enterprise Architecture framework, which is by analyzed current system design, and then being compared to the problems that have become obstacles in organizational process, and finally suggestion made to improve the service quality. The conclusions are current system at the State Attorney of ABC is not yet integrated, nor it has any control over the duration of each case processing, so it still common cause the delays and lack of service quality to the community are not uncommon. The result of this research is the proposed service strategy and process which is indicates that by using the integrated management information systems, the service at State Attorney of ABC would be better, so as to improve the quality of services that provided. © 2015 SERSC.","EA3; Enterprise architecture; Information; Management information system; Service quality; State attorney; SWOT; System","Computer architecture; Management information systems; Quality of service; EA3; Enterprise Architecture; Information; Service Quality; State attorney; SWOT; System; Information management",,,,,"Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA)The White House, , http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/e-gov/fea, [Online]., [Accessed: 05-May-2014]; Bernard, S.A., (2012) An Introduction To Enterprise Architecture, , Third Edition.

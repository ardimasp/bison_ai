The increase in hospitals' number is expected to be in line with the increase in medical and non-medical personnel in hospitals. However, the increase in resources has almost doubled compared to the increase in the number of hospitals in Indonesia. This can indicate that the hospital current conditions are less efficient. To identify the condition of the hospital’s level of efficiency, it can be done using the Stocastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) method. This analysis is based on the production function involving various input and output factors. Various types of inputs and outputs that can be considered for inclusion in the analysis model. The purpose of this study is to identify the effect of risk management factors, governance, information management on the efficiency of inpatients. The results from this study, governance is the most dominant factor in determining the level of efficiency of inpatient services, then followed by risk management factors. Thus, to improve the efficiency of inpatient services the main priority can be directed to better hospital governance. spacing. Author Profile must be in Font Size 8, with single line spacing.

Humans can sacrifice anything for health. Health needs to be supported by government facilities, one of which is a hospital. The development of hospitals in Indonesia is increasingly rapid. The availability of more hospitals needs to be supported by the resources available in the hospital. The problem that occurs at this time is that there are still many patients who complain about the lack of availability of resources both in terms of doctors, beds that must be included in the waiting schedule, medical technicians who sometimes queue up for blood collection, administrative processes that take a long time so patients are not immediately treated so on. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine the influence of resources (building area, general practitioners, specialist doctors, nurses, pharmacists, medical technicians, health workers, and non-health workers) on patients (outpatient, inpatient, and emergency room) ) in Indonesian hospitals. The method used is multiple regression with the help of SPSS 20. While the data taken is the population of all hospitals in Indonesia. The results obtained are three, first, building area, bed and medical conditions affect inpatient. Both general practitioners, medical technicians, health workers and non-health workers influence outpatients. Finally, beds, general practitioners, medical specialists, medical technicians, and health workers influence ED patients. Based on the results of these studies it can be suggested that the main focus for each type of patient needs to be considered especially those that have a significant effect. © 2019 iJOE.","Hospital; Patients; Regression; Resources",,,,,,,"Hn, S., (2015) Peranan Sektor Kesehatan dalam Pembangunan, , www.ajarekonomi.com:https://www.ajarekonomi.com/2015/12/kesehatan-sebagai-investasi-pembangunan.html, 12 17; Syukro, R., (2017) Ekonomi.

The decision-making process is still analyzed manually, so that sometimes the decisions taken are also less appropriate, effective and efficient. The second problem is the lack of monitoring data cooperative process province that is too much, making it difficult for the analysis of dynamic information to be useful. Therefore the authors want to fix the system that runs by using digital dashboard management system supported by the modeling of system dynamics. In addition, the author also did the design of a system that can support the system. Design of this system is aimed to ease the experts, head, and the government to decide (DSS - Decision Support System) accurately effectively and efficiently, because in the system are raised alternative simulation in a description of the decision to be taken and the result from the decision. The system is expected to be designed dan simulated can ease and expedite the decision making.

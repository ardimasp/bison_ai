The method used in this research is the method of comparison with a test of DDoS attacks, phishing and SQL Injection on both network, smart house network and company network. From the results of experiment, it can be concluded that the Next Generation Firewall has significantly better performance for protecting smart house and company network, it can increase security of data communication networks against threats from the Internet. © 2019 IEEE.","DDOS attack; IoT; next generation firewall; smart home; SQL injection","Automation; Computer system firewalls; Denial-of-service attack; Houses; Internet of things; Next generation networks; Company network; Data communication networks; DDoS Attack; IOT networks; next generation firewall; Phishing; Smart homes; SQL injection; Network security",,,,"Kementerian Riset, Teknologi dan Pendidikan Tinggi: 039/VR","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia for their support in making this research possible.

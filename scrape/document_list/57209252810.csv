However, many of the early adopters failed to implement it properly. Some researchers had proposed a solution by using the adaptation framework as a support, but they cannot clearly explain its development. Furthermore, the correlation between adaptation framework and problem solving is dubious. This study reviews and discusses the literature and empirical studies on the failure of Agile SD implementation by revisiting the supporting framework that used to comprehend the issues in Agile SD implementation. A comparative approach is used to review the literature available in academic databases, such as ProQuest, EBSCO, IEEE, and Scopus, to ensure research originality and novelty. By filtering 87 papers that met the initial criteria, only 4 researchers focused on the area of knowledge management and used the learning process as a supporting framework in Agile SD implementation. However, they did not clearly explain the development of the framework for Agile SD. The author’s initial research on a corporation reveals the failure of Agile SD implementation. Soft systems methodology (SSM)-based action research (AR) proposed to identify the real issues in Agile SD implementation. SSM-based AR provides a solution by clarifying the development of a framework using tacit and explicit knowledge to validate the development process. This study can help practitioners and academics understand the process of Agile SD implementation by early adopters who still need assistance with its application. This study is the first to explore Agile SD implementation in a corporation using the experience-based approach, contributing to knowledge improvement. It contributes to the scholarly literature by presenting concepts that combine human-centric aspects and knowledge management to improve the learning in the organization. © 2020, The Author(s).",,,,,,,,"Anquetil, N., Software maintenance seen as a knowledge management issue (2007) Inf Softw Technol, 49 (5), pp. 515-529; Argyris, C., Teaching smart people how to learn (2006) Organization Development: A Jossey-Bass Reader, , Gallos JV, Jossey-Bass, San Francisco, CA, USA; Argyris, C., Schön, D.A., Organizational learning: A theory of action perspective (1978) Revista española De Investigaciones sociológicas, pp. 77-78. , 1997, Reis; Argyris, C., (1999) Blackwell Business, , Oxford, Malden, Mass; Avison, D., Kock, N., Malaurent, J., Action Research in Information Systems (2017) Taylor & Francis; Avison, D., (1999) To Make Academic Research Relevant, Researchers Should Try out Their Theories with Practitioners in Real Situations and Real Organizations, 16, p. 2008. , Retrieved January; Babb, J., Hoda, R., Norbjerg, J., Embedding Reflection and Learning into Agile Software Development (2014) IEEE Software, 31 (4), pp. 51-57; Bain, A., Social Defenses Against Organizational Learning (1998) Human Relations, 51 (3), pp. 413-429; Bennett, J.K., Obrien, M.J., The Building Blocks of the Learning Organization, Training (1994) ERIC, 31 (6), p. 41; Berg, D., The, D., Vol, C., Expanding perceptions, possibilities and profits (1993) The Journal for Quality and Participation, 16 (7), p. 6. , American Society for Quality; Bierly, P.E., Hamalainen, T., Organizational learning and strategy (1995) Scand J Manag, 11 (3), pp. 209-224; Boateng, R., Do organizations learn when employees learn: the link between individual and organizational learning (2011) Development and Learning in Organizations: An International Journal, 25 (6), pp. 6-9; Boehm, B., Get ready for agile methods, with care (2002) Computer, 35 (1), pp. 64-69; Boehm, B., Turner, R., Observations on balancing discipline and agility (2003) Proceedings of the Agile Development Conference, ADC 2003, pp. 32-39. , Salt Lake City, UT, USA; Brix, J., Exploring knowledge creation processes as a source of organizational learning: A longitudinal case study of a public innovation project (2017) Scandinavian Journal of Management, 33 (2), pp. 113-127; Brown, J.S., Duguid, P., Organizational learning and communities-of-practice: toward a unified view of working, learning, and innovation (1991) Organ Sci, 2 (1), pp. 40-57; Brown, J.S., Duguid, P., Organizing Knowledge (1998) Calif Manag Rev, 40 (3), pp. 90-111; Chan, C.C.A., Examining the relationships between individual, team and organizational learning in an Australian hospital (2003) Learning in Health and Social Care, 2 (4), pp. 223-235; (2015) The Standish Group, 2015 Chaos Report, , https://www.infoq.com/articles/standish-chaos-2015, Retrieved from; Chau, T., Maurer, F., (2004) Knowledge Sharing in Agile Software Teams, , Citeseer; Chau, T., Maurer, F., Melnik, G., Knowledge sharing: Agile methods vs. Tayloristic methods (2003) Proceedings of the Workshop on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises, WETICE, pp. 302-307. , Linz, Austria, Austria; Checkland, P., Poulter, J., (2006) Learning for Action: A Short Definitive Account of Soft Systems Methodology and Its Use for Practitioner, Teachers, and Students, 26. , Wiley, Chichester; Chiniforooshan Esfahani, H., (2012) Transitioning to Agile: A Framework for Pre-Adoption Analysis Using Empirical Knowledge and Strategic Modeling, , http://search.proquest.com/docview/1353360860?accountid=27231, Graduate Department of Computer Science University of Toronto; Chiniforooshan Esfahani, H., Cabot, J., Yu, E., Adopting agile methods: Can goal-oriented social modeling help?

Empirical findings in “PREEMINENCE” corporation reveals that several key people who had using the Agile software development mentioned several issues to implement it, which relates to the adaptation of using Agile software development. The previous study had resolved this issue and initiated an additional approach to apply Agile software development, but none of them had investigated from the learning process perspective. Thus, the research gap exists around Agile implementation refers to the process of constructing the adaptation model, to maintain the learning process in the organization. This study offers another perspective to implement Agile software development by using an adaptation strategy as accommodation for the early adopter, which also promotes the learning in the organization. Moreover, indicating the Transactive Memory System as a potential theoretical foundation for this study and Soft System Methodology as potential research methodology, to further promote the Agile software development literature by providing propositions that guide future research. © BEIESP.","Agile; Scrum; Scrum; Soft System Methodology; Software Development; Software Development Life Cycle; Transactive Memory System; Waterfall",,,,,,"The research work for this study was initiated in a Life Insurance company “PREEMINENCE” by the approval of the Chief of Technology. The Research Question, Literature Review, and Research Methodology was formulated together with my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Dermawan Wibisono, and Achmad Ghazali, Ph.D. to support the extensive guidance during the process. Iwant to express also my thankfulness to Dr. Rachma Fitriati for helpingmy research methodology especially introducing the Soft System Methodology.","https://www.ojk.go.id/id/kanal/iknb/data-dan-statistik/asuransi/Pages/Statistik-Perasuransian-Indonesia---2016---Revised-Version.aspx, 30 July 2018).

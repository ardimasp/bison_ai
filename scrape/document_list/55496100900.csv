However, how digital (tech) startups as the initiator performs business model innovation that consciously or not disrupts incumbents from various industries, has not yet been widely analyzed empirically. This study employed a quantitative method with Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS 3 software to present and analyze the data. The sample of Indonesia digital startups was taken from the list managed by DailySocial, an Indonesia digital media startup. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed among the Founders and or C-Level of Indonesia startups adopting a random sampling technique. The findings of this study showed that startups apply disruptive business model innovation to survive and scale-up. This study also suggested some predictors of disruptive business model innovation. As an alternative to implementing dynamic capabilities, startups need to have transformation capability in the form of continuous reconfiguration capability; leadership aspects, especially entrepreneurship mentality, which are embodied in strategic orientation; and stakeholder management support. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Continuous reconfiguration capability; Disruptive business model innovation; Stakeholder management; Startups; Strategic orientation",,,,,"Binus University","We would like to express our gratitude to all parties who helped this study.

The paper seeks to explore and understand the drivers of P2P lending sectors in Indonesia and to determine the challenges faced by the peer-to-peer lending sector in Indonesia by analyzing the three perspectives of this sector: users (lenders & borrowers), businesses, and regulator. A qualitative approach is used to collect and analyze data. The data is collected through open-ended and in-depth interviews with users, companies and government agency. A thematic analysis method using code mapping was developed during data analysis. The finding shows different results, from the regulator’s perspective, business lending users’ and borrowers’ views. Business opportunity and platform convenience are the drivers, policy risks and lending system are the challenges. The paper concludes there is still a potential sector in an early stage of development. Many improvements can be done through regulations, businesses approach (i.e., policy), and user participation in supporting small businesses. The findings found that OJK might be one party that has planned far in the future of P2P lending, such as the planning of users’ data privacy regulations, and regulations for P2P lending businesses that will not be too strict and still supports its innovation and development. Thus, with such changes, there could be more drivers and challenges in the future that can be explored.

Waste Bank is local wisdom initiative from Indonesia for the waste management. Waste banks are established in a special environment for around 1,000 residents and are usually managed by people and targeted to people who want to increase their income. Bank customers bring all non-organic waste to banks that are treated as deposits. Transactions are recorded preferably in the bank book that the customer keeps or alternates in the list stored by the bank. Many banks also accept organic waste while the rest support composting at home. Waste banks sell materials stored to agents or ultimately to waste bank central developed by government and supplied to company for reuse or recycling. So, waste deposits are converted into money that can be withdrawn when needed after a contribution of around 10% to 15% is reduced for bank operational costs. Community empowerment through the concept of a waste bank still needs the support of infrastructure and information technology facilities and profitable partnerships. The empowerment program for the citizens were conducted through counseling, education, training with as well as dialogue with the citizens in the targeted community. The community waste bank will not have the potential to grow without the involvement and support from the stakeholders. It becomes important to develop model and implement the partnerships, networking and institutional cooperation mechanism between the community, waste bank management, institution, business and government. The integrated partnership on waste management with system information support can generate creativity and innovation as well as to improve the welfare of the community. This paper discuss about designing mobile apps business development for integrated waste management system. It’s a proposed design model for apps and business model for waste management in Indonesia and other developing country. © BEIESP.","Case Study; Information System; Integrated Waste Management; Local Wisdom; Waste Bank",,,,,,,"Jambeck, J.R., Plastic Waste Inputs from Land into the ocean,”, p. 5; Hertati, D., Kebijakan Pengelolaan Sampah Berbasis Masyarakat Sebagai Solusi Alternatif Green City Di Kota Surabaya (2018) Din.

However, several literatures had acknowledged that this condition was the result of an abnormal internal condition, where firms competed not to engage in competitive selling activities but rather as an effort to maintain performance. This paper was written and prepared as part of a recent study in the Indonesian lighting industry, where many players in the industry considered themselves caught in a severe price war condition. Based on a qualitative survey using open-ended interviews of seven lighting companies in Indonesia, the study found that the industry regard price wars as the result of severe intra-brand competition and an effort to maintain the “status quo” of continuous growth. Propositions to ease friction in price were suggested: exploration to other market segments; exploiting information to induce loyalty; understanding rivalry through capacity size; and management of short-term performance constraints. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Internal firm condition; Lighting industry; Price Wars",,,,,,,"Barney, J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Composite Materials, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Bhattacharya, R.R., (1999) Short-Run Constraints and Price Wars, , Sydney, Australia; Bungert, M., (2003) Termination of Price Wars: A Signaling Approach, , Wiesbaden: Deutscher Universitäts-Verlag; Busse, M., Firm financial condition and airline price wars (2000) The RAND Journal of Economics, 33 (2), pp. 298-318; Caves, R.E., Porter, M.E., From entry barriers to mobility barriers: Conjectural decisions and contrived deterrence to new competition (1977) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 91 (2), pp. 241-261; Ciriminna, R., Albanese, L., Meneguzzo, F., Pagliaro, M., LED street lighting: A looking ahead perspective (2015) Green, 5 (1-6), pp. 83-94; Deneckere, R., Kovenock, D., Price leadership (1992) The Review of Economic Studies, 59 (1), pp. 143-162; Deneckere, R., Kovenock, D., Lee, R., A model of price leadership based on consumer loyalty (1992) The Journal of Industrial Economics, 40 (2), pp. 147-156; Diallo, M.F., Coutelle-Brillet, P., Riviere, A., Zielke, S., How do price perceptions of different brand types affect shopping value and store loyalty?

The study specifically examines the important interrelationship between three variables that affect customer's intention to repurchase. The results facilitate the understanding of factors that influence repurchase intention of online shopping in Jakarta. One hundred valid responses from a set questionnaires were analysed. Regression analysis was employed to test the hypotheses. The results showed the customer's price perception and after-delivery satisfaction influenced their overall satisfaction and their intention to return to the same online shop (e-Tailer). In addition, overall satisfaction influenced repurchase intention at e-Tailer. Customer at-checkout satisfaction was not found to influence the overall satisfaction and their intention to return to shop at the same e-Tailer. The findings suggested that customers after checking-out from an e-Tailer required further favourable experiences to support their judgment and decision to return to the same online shop. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","After-delivery satisfaction; At-checkout satisfaction; Intention to return online; Overall satisfaction; Price perception",,,,,"Binus University","This research was supported by Bina Nusantara University.

The study found that within the context of competition, firms regard loyalty and sensitivity to be influenced by sufficient acceptance of price positioning strategies. © 2018 Authors.","Brand loyalty; Customer characteristics; Lighting industry; Price sensitivity; Price Wars",,,,,,,"Green, E.J., Porter, R.H., Noncooperative Collusion under Imperfect Price Information (1984) Econometrica, 52 (1), pp. 87-100; Rotemberg, J., Saloner, G., A Supergame-Theoretic Model of Business Cycles and Price Wars During Booms (1986) Am Econ Rev, 76, pp. 380-407. , June 1986; Tirole, J., (1988) The Theory of Industrial Organization, , Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press; Busse, M., Firm Financial Condition and Airline Price Wars (2000) RAND J Econ, 33 (2), pp. 298-318; Dickson, P.R., Urbany, J.E., Retailer Reactions to Competitive Price Changes (1994) J Retail, 70 (1), pp. 1-21; Griffith, D.E., Rust, R.T., The Price of Competitiveness in Competitive Pricing (1997) J Acad Mark Sci, 25 (2), pp. 109-116; Guiltinan, J.P., Agressive and Predatory Pricing: A Framework for Analysis (1996) J Mark, 60 (3), pp. 87-102; Hess, J.D., Gerstner, E., Price-matching Policies: An Empirical Case (1991) Manag Decis Econ, 12 (4), pp. 305-315; Scherer, F.M., Ross, D.R., (1990) Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance, , Houghton Mifflin; Elzinga, K.G., Mills, D.E., Price Wars Triggered by Entry (1999) Int J Ind Organ, 17 (2), pp. 179-198; Kalra, A., Rajiv, S., Srinivasan, K., Response to Competitive Entry: A Rationale for Delayed Defensive Reaction (1998) Mark Sci, 17 (4), pp. 380-405; Klemperer, P., Price Wars Caused by Switching Costs (1989) Rev Econ Stud, 56 (3), pp. 405-420; Ramaswamy, V., Gatignon, H., Reibstein, D.J., Competitive Marketing Behavior in Industrial Markets (1994) J Mark, 58 (2), pp. 45-55; Robinson, W.T., Marketing Mix Reaction to Entry (1988) Mark Sci, 7 (4), pp. 368-385; Heil, O.P., Helsen, K., Toward an understanding of price wars: Their nature and how they erupt (2001) Int J Res Mark, 18 (1-2), pp. 83-98; Porter, M.E., (1980) Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors, , New York: The Free Press; Bertini, M., Price wars and the managers who start them (2014) Bus Strateg Rev, 25 (4), pp. 52-55; Besanko, D., Dranove, D., Shanley, M., Schaefer, S., (2013) Economics of Strategy, , Hollenebeck J, editor.

The methodology includes an empirical study that was conducted in education franchising in Indonesia. The results show that the quality of relational relation is important in improving franchisee performance results. Meanwhile, entrepreneur orientation as a moderator variable gives an effect towards the improvement of franchisee performance. From the four indicators of entrepreneur orientation, in education franchise context in Indonesia, the most required indicator is the courage to take risks. This quality is required by franchisee in increasing franchisee performance because without courage to try new things and find creative ideas, franchisee performance will not improve.

Therefore, every organization needs reliable workforce support that can help reach their vision and mission. This includes the BINUS BUSINESS SCHOOL institution, which is trying to achieve its long term vision to become a ""World-Class Knowledge Institution"" by 2020. It is even more so by looking at the condition of the Indonesian upper educational industry that since early 2000 has been competing to provide new educational services to society, especially in the form of business school service. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain employee satisfaction along with their commitment and involvement in supporting the effort to achieve the long term target. The purpose of this research is to analyze the influence of employee satisfaction moderated by employee engagement towards employee work performance and retention. The respondents participated within the study are all employees of the institution, with the data gathering techniques applied include questionnaires and multiple regression analytical method with moderating variable. The study results show that employee satisfaction has significant positive influence towards employee work performance and retention.

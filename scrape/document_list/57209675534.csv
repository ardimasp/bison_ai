Due to the ease of developing AR by non-professionals, User Experience (UX) is often not considered in the application. Currently, there are no standard measurements of UX for AR applications especially in Education. The authors reviewed previous research to obtain UX references and the existing measurement standards. From the results of the review, the metrics were analyzed based on the characteristics of AR, especially in the field of education. The metrics will be recommended for the UX measurement of an AR application. The available standard metrics can be used to determine the UX quality of an AR application and contribute to the improvement of UX in AR applications, especially in the field of Education. © 2018 The Authors.

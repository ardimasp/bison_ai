The existing information technology (IT) system service is made by patchwork. It brings some problems in service catalog, problem managment, change management, and service level agreement (SLA). The purpose of this research is to implement helpdesk system to software company with Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework as a standard reference to solve various problem related information technology service on a company. This research starts by investigation all stakeholders of the company with some questionnares. Implementation ITIL is strated by finding the gap between the current condition and the standard base line in ITIL. After implementation IT service using ITIL, the stakeholders are asked the same questionnares. The result shows that there is significant different before and after implementing system service using ITIL. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Condensed matter physics; Engineering; Industrial engineering; Materials science; Change management; Customer services; Good services; Information technology infrastructure library (ITIL); Information technology services; Service Level Agreement (SLA); Software company; System services; Problem solving",,,,,"(2005) Introduction to ITIL; Cannon, D., Wheeldon, D., (2007) ITIL Service Operation; Taylor, C., Lloyd, S., Rudd, V., Service Strategy ITIL v3 (2007) Online, p. 276; Vicente, M., Gama, N., Da Silva, M.M., Using ArchiMate and TOGAF to understand the enterprise architecture and ITIL relationship (2013) Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, 148, pp. 134-145. , (LNBIP); Conger, S., Venkataraman, R., Hernandez, A., Probst, J., Market potential for ITSM graduates: A survey (2009) Inf.

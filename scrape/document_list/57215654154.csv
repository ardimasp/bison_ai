Almost all leading banks already have an internet banking system. For banks, the internet banking system helps banks to be able to compete in the banking industry while providing excellent service to their customers. This study aims to evaluate the use of the internet banking system that was just launched by one of the banks in Indonesia using UTAUT combined with Task Technology-Fit and Trust. The subjects of this study were 230 users of internet banking registered in one of the branches. In this study, we assess the effect of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, task-technology-fit and trust on the behavior intention. And other purpose is to assess the effect of facilitating conditions and behavior intention on use behavior. By using the structural equation model (SEM) and SmartPLS software, the results of this study show that performance expectancy, social influence, and trust have a positive effect on behavior intention. While facilitating conditions and behavior intention have a positive effect on use behavior in the use of the internet banking system. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

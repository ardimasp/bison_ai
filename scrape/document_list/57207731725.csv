With the use of technology, business competition is increasing, companies in this case petroleum industry are competing to improve the quality of the distribution process. Effectiveness and efficiency of the operational process of distribution become an essential role in contributing the company's profit. During this time Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) has been widely used in implementing the company's operational supply chain process. However, the use of ERP itself still has a lot of obstacles and limitations, especially for operational activities in the field where there are various separate software and hardware that must be integrated. This article discusses how the integration solution between ERP and operational supply chain in Tank Terminal called Terminal Automation System (TAS). The purpose of this article is to find out how to design the terminal automation concept and its implementation with the use of technology trends such as Big Data Analytics and Internet of Things. It is useful for similar companies in improving the quality of their distribution such as utilization, productivity, and safety through appropriate systems and technology integration solutions. © 2018 IEEE.","Big Data Analytics; Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP); Integration; Internet of Things; Supply Chain; Tank Terminal; Terminal Automation System (TAS)","Advanced Analytics; Automation; Big data; Competition; Data Analytics; Gas industry; Integration; Internet of things; Pattern recognition; Petroleum industry; Resource allocation; Supply chains; Tanks (containers); Business competition; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Enterprise resource planning (ERP); Oil and Gas Industry; Software and hardwares; Tank terminals; Technology Integration; Terminal automation systems; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,"Bhardwaj, A., (2013) International Journal of Advanced Research in Transforming Business: Integrating ERP with E-Business, 3 (7), pp. 653-656; Awad, H.A.H., Nassar, M.O., Supply chain integration: Definition and challenges (2010) Proceedfings Int.

Therefore, it is interesting to explore how teenagers nowadays use their gadgets and how their parents control this use. This study aims to investigate the parenting models of working mothers on their digitally native teenagers in using gadgets. The participants of this study are mothers who work outside their home. They are asked questions with regard to their teenagers’ using gadgets by means of interview techniques. The method used for analysis is qualitative and descriptive one. The results show that in doing their parenting, working mothers basically apply democratic style. This style encourages children to discuss what they want, thus there is cooperation between parents and children. In addition, children are perceived as individuals, therefore, parents should provide guidance and direction. As a result, the control on the use of gadgets is still provided. © IJSTR 2019.","Digitally native teenager; Gadget; Parenting model; Working mother",,,,,,,"Setiawan, W., Era Digital dan Tantangannya (2017) Seminar Nasional Pendidikan, Bandung: Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia; Permana, K.S., Fenomena Cyberbullying Meningkat di Indonesia (2018) Jabar.Tribunnews.Com; Hardiansyah, R., 20 Persen Pelanggan PSK di Lampung Ternyata Siswa SMA, PKBI Ungkap Fakta (2018) Lampung.Tribunnews.Com; Fahmi, Y., (2018) Noriyu: Kecenderungan Mati Muda Dengan Bunuh Diri Mulai Terlihat Di Indonesia, , Liputan6.com; (2018), Harianaceh.co.id, Anak-Anak Juga Retan Bunuh Diri.

It is used not only to link to their friends but also to obtain information. However, the rapid development of Facebook use has not only a positive impact but also a negative one. One that should be a concern is that the truth of the information posted in Facebook is not always accountable. Several users are likely to trust the information posted even though it is not reliable. As a result, it is not uncommon that the information on Facebook can actually make the disintegration on the nation. Therefore, this study is conducted to describe how Facebook can be used by young people to make Indonesian nation more integrated. The informants are nine students of Bina Nusantara University who are selected randomly. The data are collected using interview technique based on nine relevant questions. Then the data are analyzed using the theory of Uses and Gratifications. The results show that social media such as Facebook can be used by university students as a tool to maintain and develop Indonesian's national integration. They can also manage not to allow such media to make the nation disintegrated. This result implies that when social media is used wisely and positively, it supports the nation for sustainable integration. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Disintegration; Integration; Students; Facebook; Indonesia; It supports; Social media; Sustainable integrations; University students; Uses and gratifications; Young peoples; Social networking (online)",,,,,,"Yusuf, O., (2016), Hampir Semua Pengguna Internet Indonesia Memakai Facebook Online Tekno.com; Zakaria, I., (2015), Remaja Indonesia Makin Tergantung Dengan Facebook Ketika Liburan Online Tekno.com; Basilisco, R., Cha, K.J., Uses and gratification motivation for using facebook and the impact of facebook usage on social capital and life satisfaction among filipino users (2015) International Journal of Software Engineering and Its Applications, 9, pp. 181-194; Sianipar, A.P., Pemanfaatan youtube di kalangan mahasiswa (2013) USU, 2; Ha, Y.W., Kim, J., Libaque-Saenz, C.F., Chang, Y., Park, M.C., Use and gratifications of mobile sns: Facebook and kakaotalk in korea (2014) Telematics and Informatics, 32 (3), pp. 425-438; Irianto, A.M., Integrasi nasional sebagai penangkal etnosentrisme di indonesia (2013) Humanika, 18, pp. 1-9; Haryono, B., Sulistyo, E.T., Zuber, A., Model pendidikan partisispatif empat pilar bangsa bagi integrasi nasional (2013) Komunitas, 5, pp. 240-251",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Advance and Scientific Innovation, ICASI 2018","23 April 2018 through 24 April 2018",,148653,17426588,,,,"English","J.

Therefore, the author tries to explain a method for teaching mathematics (especially for elementary school students), to be easily understood by students. As a result, mathematics is no longer perceived hard. One good method of learning mathematics is the use of models (bar modeling). The author conducted research by providing two different treatments, without bar modeling and with bar modeling, to the elementary school students. The result showed that the use of bar modeling has increased students’ scores significantly. Bar modeling is not the only method of teaching at the elementary level, and it is easier for elementary school students in learning mathematical concepts of symbolization in problem solving. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.","Bar modeling; Elementary level; Mathematics",,,,,,,"Abdurrahman, M., (1999) Pendidikan Bagi Anak berkesulitan Belajar, , Penerbit Rineka Cipta, Jakarta; Dick, W., Carey, L., Carey, J.O., (2005) The Systematic Design of Instruction, , Pearson, Boston; Eric, C.C., (2009) Journal of Science and Mathematics, p. 36; FitzSimmons, J.A., http://plato.wilmington.edu:http://plato.wilmington.edu/faculty/jfitzs/tchg_phi.htm, plato.wilmington.edu., Retrieved April 1, 2010; Gredler, M.E., (2001) Learning and Instruction: Theory Into Practice, , 4th edn., Merrill Prentice Hall, Ohio; Hadi, S., Mathematics Education Reform Movement In Indonesia (2012) 12th International Congress on Mathematical Education, , COEX, Seoul, Korea; Hardiman, F.B., (2007) Filsafat Modern, , Gramedia, Jakarta; Smith, P.L., Ragan, T.J., (1993) Instructional Design, , Merill, New York; Wyatt, W., http://arapaho.nsuok.edu:http://arapaho.nsuok.edu/∼wyattw/webfiles/philosophy.html, arapaho.nsuok.edu., Retrieved April 1, 2010","Willyarto, M.N.; Bina Nusantara UniversityIndonesia",,,"American Scientific Publishers",,,,,19366612,,,,"English","Adv.

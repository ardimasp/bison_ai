The use of Information Technology is hoped to increase its ability in competing with others. The purpose of this research is to use Zachman Framework in enterprise architecture to equalize excellent management vision with system developer so that development of targeted system according to goal. Interviews, observation, and field studies are combined with the literature and knowledge to do this research. The result of this research of Zachman Framework is an enterprise architecture using cloud reporting tools (BI) that helps excellent management in making decisions in order to make business strategies. © 2018 IEEE.","BI; Business Strategies; Cloud Reporting Tools; Enterprise Architecture; Information Technology; Zachman Framework","Bismuth; Computer architecture; Information technology; Information use; Pattern recognition; Research and development management; Strategic planning; Business strategy; Enterprise Architecture; Its efficiencies; Making decision; Reporting tools; System developers; System development; Zachman framework; Decision making",,,,,,"Surendro, K., Pengembangan Rencana Induk Sistem Informasi (2009) Inform.

But aligning business strategies with information system(IS) and information technology(IT) is not as easy as it seems, because there are several gaps of strategies between upper level and practical level. Often the focus in system development is only on the architecture of the future system, even though the study says that the engineering model of needs is the most important thing in the process of developing the company's system. PT. SBS is a distributor and supplier company. Along with the development of its business, business processes also become more complex. The information system that was originally felt to be sufficient is considered to be no longer optimal so that it often results in delays in delivery with a fairly large percentage. Therefore, an Enterprise Resources Planning(ERP) system will be developed but it must be ensured that the business processes used are oriented towards organizational goals. The purpose of this study is to introduce and explain the stages of the Organization Goal-Oriented Requirement Engineering (OGORE) method as a requirement engineering method in a company's business processes that focuses on organizational goals. The research method was done by collecting business process data and defining key performance indicators(KPIs) in a small discussion group with stakeholders in the company. The results of this method were Goal Tree Model (GTM) diagrams which was then used as a reference in describing new business processes and in preparing the requirements specification documents. The conclusion obtained that the stages of the OGORE method are able to eliminate needs according to the organization's goals. It is also recommended to use the OGORE method as one of the requirements management steps in the Enterprise Architecture method to create new method as an agenda for the future. © 2019 F. L.

The research objective is to implement an synchronization algorithm which is able to maintain consistency of data owned by different databases through web service, so that data is always up to date. In this study, the implementation will describe the difference of data synchronization algorithm between unidirectional synchronization with bidirectional synchronization in different device through Web Service so users can still use the same data although using a different device. The implementation also adding additional information called as a marker to decide whether the data is need to ignore or synchronized to another database. © 2015 The Authors.

They are retrieval failure, interference failure to store and motivated forgetting. So, it is considered to have tools in order to prevent those. This happens almost everywhere, including when the drivers forgot where their car has been parked. Furthermore, the increase of parking fee is also considerable. The purpose of this research is to design a prototype system for mobile web as one of the helpful tools for car parking location reminder using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology that implemented at the parking building. The research is conducted by direct observation of the current system, do a comparison of similar applications, design the architecture of the system, make the programs, create a mock-up and mobile web as a prototype. The result of this research is a prototype of parking location reminder using RFID-based on mobile web. The mobile web displays information menu such as the location and the parking information. Based on the research, it is concluded that the mobile web can be used as one of solutions for parking location reminder and allows users to view information such as the parking duration and the parking fee estimation. © 2013 Science Publications.","Mobile web; Parking building; Prototype; RFID; System",,,,,,"Kianpisheh, A., Mustaffa, N., Limtrairut, P., Keikhosrokiani, P., Smart Parking System (SPS) architecture using ultrasonic detector (2012) Int.

By looking at these requirements, a safer way to communicate, such as Cryptography, has been developed. However, the result of this method is not sufficient, because it still risk from the interception of the sent data, caused by cryptography which only hides the data resulting the packaging to be suspicious and draw attention of the hijackers. Therefore, Steganography then developed in which not only hides the content, but also deceptive hijackers with packaging that is not suspicious. In this paper, we discuss the design of steganography which is applied in mobile devices (e.g. mobile phone) using the BPCS (Bit-Plane Complexity Segmentation) by hiding text message into the media reservoir of JPEG data types images. When using this method the message hiding capacity is larger than any other method, up to 40% of the image container. The simulation result reconstructed images which is measured by an objective assessment parameters, based on the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio PSNR, with efficient value obtained on average is 74.3294 dB which is well worth the image quality. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Cryptography; Mobile device; PSNR; Steganography",,,,,,"Cachin, C., (2005) Digital Steganography, , http://www.zurich.ibm.com/~cca/papers/encyc.pdf, Switzerland, Accessed on 30 December 2011; Bucklin, T., Davidson, C., Newman, D., Sergaves, J., Taylor, D., (2009) PSNR Quality Analysis Methodology, , http://techblog.cineform.com/, April 18, Accessed pada 20 Januari 2012; Chamorro, A.G.H., Miyatake, M.N., A new methodology of image steganalysis including for jpeg steganography (2010) Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics Conference (CERMA); Chen, Y.H., Huang, H.C., A copyright information embedding system for android platform (2011) Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing; Kawaguchi, E., (1999) A Research on Bit-Plane Complexity Segmentation Based Steganography, , Kyushu Institute of Technology; Kawaguchi, E., Eason, Richard.O., (1998) Principle and Applications of BPCS Steganography, , http://www.ece.umaine.edu/~eason/steg/SPIE98.pdf, Kitakyushu, Japan: Kyushu Institue of Technology.

Hermeneutics priority to the principle of interpretation of a text studied. While quantitative positivism path to get the truth based on the reality itself. Hermeneutics applying qualitative elements, while positivism applies quantitative elements in studied. The question is whether these two methods can be synthesized?

Neuro research done by taking three (3) main processes, namely: exploration research (qualitative), then explanatory research (quantitative) and finally confirmatory studies (quantitative).

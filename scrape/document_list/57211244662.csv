Inability to understand financial concepts and risks may lead to wrong decision making then further worsen someone's financial condition. Therefore financial literacy became significant knowledge to have. This financial literacy should be supported by some mechanism to record, monitor, and control an individual financial activity. This study observed the potential value of an mobile-based application “Manage on Money (MoM)” to solve those problem. MoM has three main features for each of those problems. First, “Add Income” and “Add Expense” menu, which is implemented using Google Vision Cloud API Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This menu helps the user record their income and expenses. Second, “Buy or Bye” menu, which is utilizing 50/20/30 budgetting rule. This menu helps the user control their budget usage. Third, “Recurring Transaction” menu, which is implemented using OneSignal API. This menu helps the user monitor their regularly expense and notify them during the due date. Overall score of over than 3 out of 4 was given by the respondent as evaluation of Manage on Money performances and usefulness. © 2019 The Authors.

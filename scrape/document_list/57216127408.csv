The research method used is Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modelling, PLS-SEM to determine the relationship between E-SQ to CS, E-SQ to BI, CS to BI and the relationship of E-SQ to BI with CS as a mediating variable. In processing data, it is known that E-SQ significantly affects CS with a value of 81.1%. Non-significant E-SQ affects BI with a value of 0.056, where E-SQ significantly affects BI with CS variable as a mediating variable with a value of 0.599. Based on the calculation results, it is found that CS directly affects BI users of electronic money ABC with a value of 0.669. This shows that the higher the E-SQ given, the higher the level of customer satisfaction will also have an impact on BI users of electronic money X-cash. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","behaviour intention; customer satisfaction; e-money; e-service quality; PLS-SEM","Data handling; Electronic money; Least squares approximations; Quality of service; Sales; Behaviour intentions; Calculation results; E-service quality; Partial least square (PLS); research methods; Structural equation modelling; Customer satisfaction",,,,,"(2018) Statistic of Indonesia's System Finance (SSKI), , https://www.bi.go.id, Bank of Indonesia Download on August 9, 2018 source; Ataburo, H., Muntaka, A.S., Quansah, E.K., Linkages among E-Service Quality, Satisfaction, and Usage of E-Services within Higher Educational Environments (2017) Int.

When changes happen, employees need to adapt to the work environment and this can influence many aspects of employees’ working life. The performance of employees will influence the performance of an organisation and one of the factors that influences employee performance is employee motivation. The changes can be through communication and culture differences. Television broadcasting service companies must focus on their human resource because they employ a large number of workers. There are 19 major television companies in Indonesia. The broadcasting industry is one of the pioneers of private television stations in Indonesia. Media Citra Nusantara owns RCTI, Global TV and iNews TV. The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of organisational communication and organisational culture on employee motivation and its impact on employee performance in the broadcasting industry. The method of data collection used in this study is the questionnaire. Questionnaires were distributed to 300 employees. The data analysis method used in this study is path analysis. The results of this study shows that organisational culture does not influence employee performance, while organisational communication and employee motivation influence employee performance. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Employee motivation; Employee performance; Organisational communication; Organisational culture; Path analysis",,,,,,"Azar, M., Shafighi, A.A., The effect of work motivation on employees’ job (2013) International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences, 3 (9), pp. 1-9; Bhatia, K., Balani, M., Effective internal communication: A crucial factor affecting employee performance (2015) Proceedings of International Conference on Management, Economics and Social Sciences, , Dubai; Browaeys, M.J., Price, R., (2011) Understanding Cross-Culture Management, , Ontario: Perason Education; Chaudhary, N., Sharma, D.B., Impact of employee motivation on performance (productivity) in private organization (2012) International Journal of Business Trends and Technology, 2 (4), pp. 29-35; Ganta, V.C., Motivation in the work place to improve employee performance (2014) International Journal of Engineering Technology, Management and Applied Science, 2 (6), pp. 221-230; Ghozali, I., (2011) Aplikasi Analisis Multivariate Dengan Program SPSS [Application of Multivariate Analysis Using The SPSS Programme], , Semarang: Badan Penerbit Universitas Diponegoro; Harris, T.E., Nelson, M.D., (2008) Applied Organizational Communication: Theory and Practice in A Global Environment, , New York: Lawrence Erlbaum; Iqbal, A., Ijaz, M., Latif, F., Mushtaq, H., Factors affecting employees’ performance: A case of the banking sector in Pakistan (2015) European Journal of Business and Social Science, 4 (8), pp. 309-318; Karki, J., Types of business communication (2012) Business Communication, , jb-karki.blogspot.com/2012/02/types-of-business-communication.html?m=1; Locker, K., Kaczmarek, S., (2010) Business Communication: Building Critical Skills, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Neves, P., Eisenberger, R., Management communication and employee (2012) Human Performance, 25 (5), pp. 452-464; Rajhans, K., Effective organizational communication: A key to employee motivation and performance (2012) Interscience Management Review, 2 (2), pp. 81-85; Ramadanty, S., Martinus, H., Organizational communication and motication in the work place (2016) HUMANIORA, 7 (1), pp. 77-86; Rounok, N., Parvin, M.M., Fostering employee performance: A literature review (2011) Industrial Engineering Letters, 1 (3), pp. 1-9; Sekaran, U., Bougie, R., (2013) Research Methods for Business, , West Sussex, UK: John Wiley & Sons; Simamora, B.H., Leadership for performance excellence (2013) International Business Management, 7 (4), pp. 247-257; Simamora, B.H., Marsellinus, J., Hartono, H., Strategy alignment with organizational culture assessment instrument (OCAI) results of cellular industry in Indonesia (2016) International Journal of Economics and Management, 10 (S1), pp. 81-93; Sugiyono, (2013) Statistika Untuk Penelitian [Statistics for Research], , Bandung: Alfabeta; Tabanchnick, B.G., Fidell, L.S., (2014) Using Multivariate Statistic, , (6th ed.).

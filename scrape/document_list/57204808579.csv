Further, this research investigates whether interaction of corporate and endorser credibility in ads can help consumers improve their perception toward the risk and confidence to purchase the product. An experimental study with a 2 (endorser credibility: high vs. low) × 2 (corporate credibility: high vs. low) full-factorial, between-subjects design was used to see the interaction effect of both corporate and endorser credibility on consumer perceived risk and consumer confidence to purchase a product. In a technologically complex product such as smartphones, consumers’ perceived risk was found to be lower when the product was produced by a credible company but endorsed by a less credible source, than when it was produced by a less credible company but endorsed by a more credible source. Consumer confidence in purchasing the product was also higher when the product was produced by a credible company but endorsed by a less credible source, than when it was produced by a less credible company but endorsed by a more credible source. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","consumer confidence; Corporate credibility; Elaboration Likelihood Model; endorser credibility; perceived risk; purchase decision; technologically complex product",,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., Joachimsthaler, E., (2000) Brand Leadership, , New York: Free Press; Akaah, I.P., Korgaonkar, P.K., A Conjoint Investigation of the Relative Importance of Risk Relievers in Direct Marketing (1988) Journal of Advertising Research, 28 (August/September), pp. 38-44; Atkin, C., Block, M., Effectiveness of Celebrity Endorsers (1983) Journal of Advertising Research, 23 (February/March), pp. 57-61; Bauer, R.A., Consumer Behavior as Risk Taking (1960) Dynamic Marketing for a Changing World, pp. 389-398. , Hancock R.S., (ed), Chicago, IL: American Marketing Association,. edited by; Bennett, P.D., Harrell, G.D., The Role of Confidence in Understanding and Predicting Buyers’ Attitudes and Purchase Intentions (1975) Journal of Consumer Research, 2, pp. 110-117; Berger, I.E., The Nature of Attitude Accessibility and Attitude Confidence: A Triangulated Experiment (1992) Journal of Consumer Psychology, 1, pp. 103-123; Berger, I.E., Mitchell, A.A., The Effect of Advertising on Attitude Accessibility, Attitude Confidence, and the Attitude-Behavior Relationship (1989) Journal of Consumer Research, 16 (December), pp. 269-279; Biswas, D., Biswas, A., Das, N., The Differential Effects of Celebrity and Expert Endorsements on Consumer Risk Perceptions: The Role of Consumer Knowledge, Perceived Congruency, and Product Technology Orientation (2006) Journal of Advertising Research, 35 (2), pp. 17-31; Bower, B.A., Landreth, S., Is Beauty Best?

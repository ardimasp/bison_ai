Presently, agile software development method is operated to cope with requirements that changes dynamically. This study seeks to find out and discuss what types of method that have been exploited for decision making on managing feasible requirements and challenges of decision making in agile software development. Papers reviewed in this study are published from 2017 to present. Resulting 8 papers that have been identified of presenting decision making methods. Using these papers, 11 methods and 7 challenges of decision making identified. This study contributes a review of requirement management and engineering by providing decision making methods on agile software development and the challenges of decision making for requirement engineering. © 2019 The Authors.

Cities will naturally attract people from different nationalities to live, study and work. The rapid development of cities has long been regarded as major drive of urbanization from other areas which contributed to the high level of ethnic and race diversities. However diversity is currently seen under threat due to the rise of global populism that is mainly fuelled by anxiety over economic condition. The growth of nationalist movement, anti-immigrant parties and xenophobia is gaining foothold across the planet. Against this backdrop, this paper aims at investigating the nexus between diversity and inequality in Jakarta. The current local election provides example of these two competing concepts. Jakarta as emerging global city with diverse communities had been marred by public protest and narration of identity issues. On the other hands, populism has deep root in severe economic inequality among the residents. A robust development in Jakarta has been marked by concentration of wealth in the hands of few. This paper presents case study on the root causes of growing populism and its relations with inequality in Jakarta. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Deep roots; Diverse community; Economic condition; Economic inequality; Global cities; Jakarta; Robust development; Root cause",,,,,"Muggah, R., Glenny, M., Populism is Poison, Plural Cities are the Antidotes (2017) World Economic Forum; Bank, W., (2015) Investing in Urban Resilience : Protecting and Promoting Resilience in A Changing World, , (World Bank); Setijadi, C., (2017) Ahok Downfall and the Rise of Islamist Populism in Indonesia, , (ISEAS: Singapore); Harrison, P., Bobbins, K., (2014) Urban Resilience Thinking for Municipalities, , (Johannesburg); Folke, C., Resilience: The emergence of a perspective for social-ecologicalsystems analyses (2006) Global Environmental Change, 16 (3), pp. 253-267; Pickett, S.T.A., Cadenasso, M., McGrath, B., (2013) Resilience in Ecology and Urban Design: Linking Theory Andpractice for Sustainable Cities, 3. , (Dordrecht, Netherlands: Springer) in S T Pickett, M Cadenasso and B McGrath eds; Leichenko, R., Climate change and urban resilience (2011) Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 3 (3), pp. 164-168. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2010.12.014; Zimmerman, R., Faris, C., Climate change mitigation and adaptation in North American cities (2011) Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 3 (3), pp. 181-187; UN-Habitat's City Resilience Profiling Programme (CRPP), , http://cityresilience.org/CRPP; ICLEI Resilience City Series, , http://resilient-cities.iclei.org/http://resilient-; 100 Resilient Cities, , http://www.100resilientcities.org/; Meerow, S., Newell, J., Stults, M., Landscape and Urban Planning, 147, pp. 38-49; (2015) City Resilience Framework, , Rockefeller Foundation; Wilson, I., (2017) Jakarta : Inequality and the Poverty of Elite Pluralism, , http://www.newmandala.org/jakarta-inequality-poverty-elite-pluralism/, (New Mandala); Tempo Penyebab Ahok Kalah Versi Dua Peneliti, , https://pilkada.tempo.co/read/news/2017/04/23/348868728/penyebab-ahok-kalah-versi-dua-peneliti-australia, Australia (23 April 2017) [Accessed July 25, 2017); 100 Resilient Cities, , http://www.100resilientcities.org/; A Setyadi Ini 9 Program Unggulan Jokowi-Ahok 2013-2017, , http://news.okezone.com/read/2013/02/05/500/756846/ini-9-program-unggulanjokowi-tahun-2013-2017, (Okezone, 5 Februari 2013) [Accessed July 30, 2017]; 100 Resilient Cities Jakarta's Resilience Challenge (N.d), , http://www.100resilientcities.org/cities/jakarta/; A Oswald Jakarta, Resilient City, , http://www.academia.edu/26872859/Jakarta_Resilient_City, [Accessed July 17,2017); http://wartaekonomi.co.id/read/2014/11/07/37618/nah-ini-dia-13-program-unggulan-pemprov-dki-2015.html, Warta Ekonomi Nah Ini Dia 13 Program Unggulan Pemprov DKI 2015 (7 November 2014) [Accessed August 1, 2017); Sindonews Bangun RPTRA, Pemda DKI Terbantu CSR Perusahaan, , https://metro.sindonews.com/read/1072985/171/bangun-rptra-dki-terbantu-csrperusahaan-1451367463, (9 Desember 2015) [Accessed August 1, 2017); Merdeka Djarot Beber Alasan Tak Cantumkan Program Penciptaan Lapangan Kerja, , https://www.merdeka.com/politik/djarot-beber-alasan-takcantumkan-program-penciptaan-lapangan-kerja.html, (22 September 2016) [Accessed July 30,2017]; Kompas DKI Tetapkan Seragam Betawi Untuk Siswa, , http://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2014/08/08/08404301/DKI.Terapkan.Seragam.Betawi.untuk.Siswa, (8 Agustus 2014) Accesed July 31.2017]",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","4th International Conference on Friendly City 2017","11 October 2017 through 12 October 2017",,135340,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

A learning method called Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL) is used to replace old learning methods with a digital game to learn. This research aims to propose the best method of DGBL design and development to create game prototypes for subject applied by International Relations Department of Bina Nusantara University. This research focuses on developing DGBL for the concept of Prisoner's Dilemma and taking the case study of Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in International Relations Studies. The research uses literature review to back up design theories and survey to determine the basic foundation of prototypes creation. Based on the research surveys, it is concluded that prototypes will apply mobile as the platform, use simulation as the genre, and adopt the style of old American cartoon. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bins; Computation theory; Computer games; Design; Game theory; Learning systems; Surveys; Design and Development; Digital game-based learning; International relations; Learning methods; Literature reviews; Prisoner's dilemma; Prototype designs; Research survey; E-learning",,,,,"Dawes, R.M., Social Dilemmas (1980) Annual Review of Psychology Ed, 31 (1), pp. 169-193; Ohdaira, T., Terano, T., Cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma Game Based on the Second-Best Decision (2009) Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, 12; Perrota, C., Featherstone, G., Aston, H., Houghton, E., (2013) Game-Based Learning: Latest Evidence and Future Directions., , NFER Research Programme: Innovation in Education; Aleven, V., Myers, E., Easterday, M., Ogan, A., Toward a Framework for the Analysis and Design of Educational Games (2010) IEEE Conference on Digital Game and Intelligent Toy Enhanced Learning (DIGITEL), pp. 69-76; Ruhi, U., Towards a Descriptive Framework for Meaningful Enterprise Gamification (2015) Technology Innovation Management Review, 5, pp. 5-16; Zin, N.A., Yue, W.S., Design and Evaluation of History Digital Game-Based Learning Software (2013) Journal of Next Generation Information Technology, 4; Sommerville, I., (2010) Software Engineering, p. 9. , Addison-Wesley; Piskurich, G.M., (2006) Software Engineering, p. 396",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Computing and Applied Informatics, ICCAI 2016","14 December 2016 through 15 December 2016",,127044,17426588,,,,"English","J.

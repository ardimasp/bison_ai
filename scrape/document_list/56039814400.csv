Many locations with scarce resources, particularly unreliable internet connectivity, face difficulties in accessing and sharing EHR data. This article presents our proposed design that utilizes Amazon Web Services (AWS) for a sharing mechanism platform among distributed healthcare organizations found in an environment with scarce resources.

In recent years, machine learning has gained significant attentions as a way to build a classifier from labeled data which also can be implemented to build a gender classifier. In this study we develop gender classifier using two different datasets with different languages, English and Bahasa Indonesia. Each data from both datasets is represented by 20 acoustic features. Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) is used to build the classification model using all these features and trained only on English dataset. This model is evaluated in both dataset to get the performance matrices consist of accuracy, AUROC, precision and recall. Ultimately, using this model we also identify and compare important features from both dataset to see the different characteristics of English and Bahasa Indonesia speeches. © 2019 The Authors.

These models can help select optimal rice varieties for expected field conditions. Development of a system to help scientist track and make decisions using this data is challenging. It involves incorporation of complex data structures - genomic, phenotypic, and remote sensing - with computationally intensive statistical modeling. In this article, the authors present a web portal designed to help researchers to manage and analyze their datasets, apply machine learning to detect how factors taken together influence crop production, and summarize the results to help scientists make decisions based on the learned models. The authors developed the system to be easily accessed by the entire team including rice scientist, genetics, and farmers. As such, they developed a system on a server architecture comprised of a SQLite database, a web interface developed in Python, the Celery job scheduler, and statistical computing in R.

The process of evaluating genetic markers one by one (i.e. a marginal analysis) may not identify important polygenic and environmental effects. Further, confounding due to growing conditions/factors and genetic similarities among plant varieties may influence conclusions. When developing new plant varieties to optimize yield or thrive in future adverse conditions (e.g. flood, drought), scientists seek a complete understanding of how the factors influence desirable traits. Motivated by a study design that measures rice yield across different seasons, fields, and plant varieties in Indonesia, we develop a regression method that identifies significant genomic factors, while simultaneously controlling for field factors and genetic similarities in the plant varieties. Our approach develops a Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimator under a generalized double Pareto shrinkage prior. Through a hierarchical representation of the proposed model, a novel and computationally efficient expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is developed for variable selection and estimation. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation and is used to analyze rice yields from a pilot study conducted by the Indonesian Center for Rice Research. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Bayesian hierarchical models; EM algorithm; genomic studies; MAP estimator; rice science; shrinkage prior","drought; expectation; genetic similarity; human; Indonesia; nonhuman; pilot study; plant yield; probability; rice; scientist; season; simulation; study design; varietas; algorithm; Bayes theorem; biological model; genetics; genomics; multifactorial inheritance; Oryza; procedures; Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Genomics; Models, Genetic; Multifactorial Inheritance; Oryza",,,,"R01 AI121351

Cloud computing has many advantages, particularly the ability to allocate on-demand resources without the need to build a specialized infrastructure or perform major maintenance. However, one of the problems faced by the researcher is the availability of computer tools to perform research. Docker is a lightweight virtualization for developers that can be used to build, ship, and run a range of distributed applications.

This alternative arises due to many of the systems, which developed mostly by using microcontroller are not giving any room for customization to increase its performance or I/O ports. There is any possibility that the system designed to be used by using general processor such as PC to increase its performance but it will give another problem such as interface difficulty for high speed I/O, real time processing, increases complexity, and many more. Customization is introduced by combining hard IP processor and FPGA in one chip instead of practicing two separate devices, processor and FPGA, which is commonly use in high performance embedded design. This approach allows seamless design development and development time reduction for customization.","Customization; Embedded system; FPGA; Microcontroller; System-on-chip","Controllers; Embedded systems; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Microcontrollers; System-on-chip; As interfaces; Customization; Development time; Embedded designs; High speed I/O; Realtime processing; Seamless design; Separate devices; Integrated circuit design",,,,,,,"Bohr, M., Mistry, K., (2011) ""Intel's revolutionary 22 nm transistor technology"", , Intel website; Smith, M.J., (1997) ""Application-specific integrated circuits""; Yiannacouras, P., Steffan, J.G., Rose, J., ""Application-specific customization of soft processor microarchitecture"" (2006) Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/SIGDA 14th international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays.

The goal of a parallel program is to enable the execution of larger problems and to reduce the execution time compared to sequential programs. Among parallel computing frameworks, MapReduce is a framework that enables parallel processing of data on collections of commodity computing nodes without the need to handle the complexities of implementing a parallel program. This paper presents implementations of the parallel Jacobi and Conjugate Gradient methods using MapReduce. A performance analysis shows that MapReduce can speed up the Jacobi method over sequential processing for dense matrices with dimension ≥ 14,000. © 2014 Muhamad Fitra Kacamarga, Bens Pardamean and James Baurley.","Conjugate gradient; Iterative method; Jacobi method; Mapreduce; Parallel computing",,,,,,,,"Legarra, A., Methods based on SNP estimation (BLUP_SNP and BayesCPi etc.) (2012), http://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=uga_2_normal_lasso_bayesc.pdf, [Online].

DeLone & McLean IS Success Model use to measure the successful of system while COBIT framework is to measure system maturity level. Result of this research showed that the successful of Academic Advisory IS affected by User Satifaction, Quality of Service, Quality of System while Maturity level at 3.7. The result also showed there's a relation between level of maturity system with the success of system. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","COBIT; DeLone McLean; Information system; Maturity level",,,,,,"James, A., (2010) O'Brian, , Introduction to Information Systems.

The goal of modeling them is to analyze and calculate meaning of the level of security in the cyber world. Analyzing and calculating was done by the quantitative method, so that the investment decision in security tools were expected to be objective, which were based on performance and situational experiences in an organization. Risk management was then associated with the calculation of costs that may occur with the point of view of the financial aspects of ROI/CBA, such as NPV, IRR, and ROI, so it can be measured in the level of security of the organization and can be maintained within a certain period. Our model consisted sixteen formulas that can show the increasing level of security based on the cost. © 2014 SERSC.","Asset identification; CIA; Network security; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security level","Investments; Risk assessment; Risk management; Asset identification; CIA; Financial aspects; Investment decisions; Quantitative method; Risk management models; Security level; Security tools; Network security",,,,,"Reggiani, A., Network resilience for transport security: Some methodological considerations Transport Policy; Cho Kim, B., Wan Park, Y., Security versus convenience?

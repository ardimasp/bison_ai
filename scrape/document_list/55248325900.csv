To evaluate the role of such lexical suggestions, we conducted a cross-linguistic study in which similarity judgements from two language groups (Dutch and English speakers) were compared. We paired asymmetrically informative items with items that are considered to be typical members of the referenced category (e.g., jellyfish–salmon). Our analyses revealed that items were deemed more similar by speakers of a language in which the lexical information was present (e.g., English speakers tended to give relatively higher ratings for jellyfish–salmon than Dutch participants did for the non-informative equivalent kwal–zalm). Results are discussed in light of theories of concept representation and compound processing. © Experimental Psychology Society 2018.","Concepts and categories; Lexical information; Representation; Similarity judgements","adult; animal; concept formation; decision making; female; fish; human; language; linguistics; male; physiology; translating (language); young adult; Adult; Animals; Concept Formation; Female; Fishes; Humans; Judgment; Language; Linguistics; Male; Translating; Young Adult",,,,,"F.M.D is a lecturer at Bina Nusantara University.

It is often tacitly assumed that there is a (strong) extension-intension link. However, a recent study by Hampton and Passanisi (2016) examining the patterns of stable individual differences in concepts across participants called this hypothesis into question. To conceptually replicate their findings, two studies were conducted. We employed a category judgment task to measure category extensions, whereas a property generation (in Study 1) and property judgment task (Study 2) were used to measure intensions. Using their method, that is, correlating extension and intension similarity matrices, we found nonsignificant correlations in both studies, supporting their conclusion that similarity between individuals for extensional judgments does not map onto similarity between individuals for intensional judgments. However, multilevel logistic regression analyses showed that the properties a person generated (Study 1) or endorsed (Study 2) better predicted her own category judgments compared to other people's category judgments. This result provides evidence in favor of a link between extension and intension at the subject level. The conflicting findings, resulting from two different approaches, and their theoretical repercussions are discussed. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Categorization; Extensions; Intensions","adult; concept formation; decision making; female; human; male; middle aged; pattern recognition; physiology; semantics; young adult; Adult; Concept Formation; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Middle Aged; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Semantics; Young Adult",,,,,,,"Ameel, E., Malt, B.C., Storms, G., Object naming and later lexical development: From baby bottle to beer bottle (2008) Journal of Memory and Language, 58, pp. 262-285. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2007.01.006; Ameel, E., Malt, B.C., Storms, G., Steps along a continuum of word knowledge: Later lexical development through the lens of recep-tive judgments (2014) Language Learning and Development, 10, pp. 234-262. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15475441.2013.840485; (1961) De anima, Books II and III (D.

We addressed two critical questions: what kind of features do children and adults generate to define semantic categories and which features predict category membership judgment best at each abstraction level? Overall, participants generated relatively more entity features for natural kinds categories, compared to artefact categories, as well as for basic level categories, compared to superordinate categories. Furthermore, the results showed that older children and adults generated relatively more entity features than younger children.

Contrary to the long tradition of using rating-based procedures to derive typicality judgments, we propose a method that is based on typicality ranking rather than rating, in which items are gradually sorted according to their typicality, and that requires a minimum of linguistic knowledge. The validity of the method is investigated and the method is compared to the traditional typicality rating measurement in a large empirical study with eight different semantic concepts. The results show that the typicality ranking task can be used to assess children's category knowledge and to evaluate how this knowledge evolves over time. Contrary to earlier held assumptions in studies on typicality in young children, our results also show that preference is not so much a confounding variable to be avoided, but that both variables are often significantly correlated in older children and even in adults.

Subsequently, feelings of power (Experiments 1 and 2) and abstract thinking (Experiment 3) were assessed.

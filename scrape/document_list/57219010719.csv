We argue that the game designed meticulously tailored with the learning subjects can increase the pupils' interest in learning, prevent boredom, and increase the curiosity of the students towards the learning subjects, in this case: Mathematics. The game design method proposed in this research is to combine the Six Facets of Serious Game Design and Ernest Adams' Game Design. The results show that the students that implement the serious game design as their learning tools were statistically performed better than the one who only use traditional learning tools. © 2020 ICIC International.","Game design; Learning tools; Mathematics; Serious game design",,,,,,"Chowanda, A., Prasetio, Y.

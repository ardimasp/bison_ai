The problem that is often experienced is the lack of management of the amount of bandwidth needed so that there is often a shortage or excess of bandwidth allocation at each BTS site so that this problem can reduce the profits obtained by the company. From these problems, we need a system that can regulate and predict future bandwidth requirements. In this study, bandwidth requirements will be simulated using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average method, the ARIMA method using time series data from November 2019 to January 2020. After trying out several ARIMA models (1.0.0), (1.1.0), (1.0.1), (0.0.1) and (0.0.6), it was found that the ARIMA Model (0.0.6) has the best level of accuracy with an RMSE value of 419,139. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

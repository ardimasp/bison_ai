Syahdan No. 9, Kemanggisan, Palmerah, Jakarta, 11480, Indonesia","In Indonesia, especially Jakarta, many public facilities such as airports, train stations, bus stations are equipped with the Automatic External Defibrillators (AE-Ds). The effective use of these AEDs in public places by lay bystanders is important to improve the survival rate. Unfortunately, many people still have limited knowledge about AED and its critical function and lack of willingness to use the device. This research intends to measure the proportion of people in public places who have the knowledge concerning AED device and its use. The relevant data are collected by a survey on a random sample of 400 participants performed at the busiest railway station in Jakarta, Indonesia. The results suggest that almost 65% of them are unaware of the existence of the device in the public places. As many as 35% respondents do not recognize the device, and less than 35% respondents are willing to use the equipment. © 2018, ICIC International.

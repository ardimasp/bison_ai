In Indonesia, the construction industry has contributed more than ten percent of GDP during the last five years, which is greater than Indonesia's economic growth that only constitutes around 5% annually. However, large-scale construction companies are still producing low performance. The purpose of this study is to find out the effect of managing innovation and technological adoption on business performance through the strategy of differentiation in Indonesia's construction industry. The research methods include a descriptive method through scoring analysis and verification method by quantitative analysis.

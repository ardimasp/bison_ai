Many different features extracted of the palmprint image have been employed to perform the recognition tasks. Most of the recognition efforts consequently has been put on the designing and obtaining a relevant set of effective hand-crafted features which is considered to be the drawback of the traditional image based biometric recognition systems. To overcome the aforementioned problem, in this paper we explore the applicability of MobileNet V2 deep convolutional neural networks on palmprint recognition by fine-tuning a pretrained MobileNet neural networks. We also explore the performance of dropout support vector machines (SVM) by training them on the deep features of the similar pretrained networks. The experiments are carried out using datasets provided by Hong Kong Polytechnic University of Science and Technology. The dataset consists of 6000 grayscale images of 128x128 pixels from 500 different palms. It is demonstrated that the proposed schemes exhibit state-of-the-art performance on the datasets. The second scheme, MobileNet V2 based features with SVM classifier, is able to achieve best average testing and validation accuracy rate of 100% outperforming the best previous reported results. © 2019 The Authors.

Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) is a popular approach and the most widely used in CBIR problem. In this research, a CBIR method using BoVW and multiclass SVM classifier will be proposed. In BoVW, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) will be used as the local features descriptor. This research will use Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as the method to do the visual vocabulary generation and Fisher Vector (FV) to create the encoder. The multiclass SVM classifier will use linear kernel, Hellinger’s kernel, and chi-square kernel to do the classification. After the classification, the proposed CBIR will use the classification model to classify query image. After the query image class is known, then the color histogram features will be extracted from query image and dataset which only consists of image in the same class as query image. Datasets used in the research are Corel and Guang-Hai Liu (GHIM-10K). The experimental results show that BoVW with GMM and FV produces higher accuracy than other encoding methods in BoVW which produce a good retrieval result in the CBIR. © 2017.","Bag of visual words; Content based image retrieval; Image classification",,,,,"Binus University","Acknowledgment.

Recently, a new method within the field of computational intelligence, i.e. Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LSSVM), has been investigated on its performance in predicting stock/index price. LSSVM algorithm itself is introduced as a modified version of SVM algorithm, where the computational complexity of Quadratic Programming (QP) problem in SVM is overcome by solving a set of linear equations instead. In this research, an LSSVM model is built to predict the daily close price of Jakarta Composite Index (JCI). As a comparison, other prediction models are built, namely SVM and ARIMA model which respectively represent the commonly used intelligent and conventional model. Experimental results show that LSSVM model outperforms SVM and ARIMA model in predicting the JCI close price. © 2005-2014 JATIT & LLS.

In this experimental study, an attempt to combine Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT) based feature and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as classifier is proposed. The study focused on classifying four genres of music i.e. pop, classical, jazz, and rock by using strong features such as mean, standard deviation, variance, and entropy. Data used in the study is obtained from GTZAN Collection Data Sets. Based on the experimental results, the proposed approach produces 88.33% accuracy, which is higher than several previous methods that could only obtain accuracy up to 86.4%. © 2005 -2014 JATIT & LLS.

NMF can reduce the dimension of highly dimensional data such as multimedia data. In many researches, NMF can also be used as classification technique which is done by utilizing the extracted feature from NMF process. So far, NMF and its variation such as LNMF has been used to classify human facial expression. Unfortunately, for high dimensional data such as human faces, those methods are computationally expensive. This paper mainly discuss about the human facial expression recognition technique using 2DNMF. This research is done by implementing 2DNMF for facial expression recognition and comparing its result to that of NMF and LNMF. From the experimental result, it can be concluded that 2DNMF can be used for human facial expression recognition with better accuracy and much efficient time. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","2DNMF; Face expression recognition",,,,,,,"Li, S.Z., Hou, X.W., Zhang, H., Learning spatially localized, parts-based representation (2001) Int.

Statistics show that the case of breast cancer in the world is increasing every year. By analyzing a mammogram, pathologists could detect the presence of microcalcification in ones breast. However, microcalcification could be classified into benign and malignant. The later indicates the presence of cancer. Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CADx) designed to help phatologists determine the type of microcalcification in a mammogram. Usually, it's consist of two steps, feature extraction and classification. In our methodology, we proposed the use of dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT CWT) as feature extraction technique and support vector machine (SVM) as classifier. Using this methodology, our experimental result achieved good classification accuracy. However, some of the previous researches have shown better results than ours. © 2010 IEEE.","Computer-aided diagnosis; Dual-tree complex wavelet transform; Mammogram; Microcalcification classification; Support vector machine","Breast Cancer; Classification accuracy; Dual-tree complex wavelet transform; Feature extraction and classification; Feature extraction techniques; Mammogram; Microcalcifications; Feature extraction; Mammography; Partial discharges; Support vector machines; Telecommunication; Vectors; Wavelet transforms; X ray screens; Computer aided diagnosis",,,,,,"Yusof, N.Md., Isa, N.A.M., Sakim, H.A.M., Computer-aided detection and diagnosis for microcalcifications in mammogram: A review (2007) ICJSNS International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, 7 (6), pp. 202-208. , June; Safavian, N., Kasaei, S., Complex Wavelet Transform-based Color Indexing for Content-based Image Retrieval, , unpublished; Rivaz, P., Kingsbury, N., Complex Wavelet Features for Fast Texture Image Retrieval, , unpublished; MIAS Database, , http://peipa.essex.ac.uk/info/mias.html; Kotsiantis, S.B., Supervised machine learning: A review of classification techniques (2007) University of Peloponnese: Informatica, 31, pp. 249-268. , July; Zhang, L., Lin, F., Zhang, B., Support Vector Machine Learning for Image Retrieval, , IEEE, in press; Rejani, Y.I.A., Selvi, S.T., Digital mammogram segmentation and tumour detection using artificial neural networks (2008) International Journal of Soft Computing, 3, pp. 112-119; Bozek, J., Mustra, M., Delac, K., Grgic, M., A survey of image processing algorithms in digital mammography (2009) Rec.

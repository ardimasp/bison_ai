In the determination of the location used with approach methodology Analytical Process Hierarchy and with an approach of Method of Delphi. Therefore, the Delphi Method approach will be able to produce the best alternative from the selected land location. While the complex problems in this study can be simplified and accelerated in the decision-making process with Analytical Process Hierarchy. Determining the location of the surveyed land has a semi-structured, complex and multi-criteria problem. It is necessary to approach the Delphi Method in the survey to obtain data and information as a result of the most reliable communication and consensus alignment of expert groups in their respective fields. The choice of alternative land location with Analytical Process Hierarchy and the use of Delphi Method is the best decision alternative from a selected land location for use in the planning of multi-functional terminal development at Merak Port. © 2017 IEEE.","Delphi method; Hierarchy Analytical Process; Terminal Check-in location","Information management; Location; Stars; Surveys; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Analytical process; Check-in; Data and information; Decision making process; Delphi method; Reliable communication; Terminal development; Decision making",,,,,"Boar, B.H., (2001) The Art for Strategic Planning for Information System, , Second Edition ed.

Routing protocol mechanism on MANET can be classified proactive, reactive and hybrid. On this paper researcher comparing QOS with reactive and proactive, reactive represented by DSR and proactive by DSDV. Performance of these routing protocols is evaluated with performance metrics such as Dropped Packets, Packet Delivery Ratio, Throughput, End to End Delay, Jitter, and Residual energy. Based on experiment shows that DSDV is better than DSR, performance DSDV more stable than DSR, DSR on little node better than DSDV, but in line with increment number of node performance is degrade. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Energy utilization; Mobile telecommunication systems; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Dropped packets; End to end delay; Node performance; Packet delivery ratio; Performance metrics; Residual energy; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,,,"Li, X., Zi-Wen, W., Bao-Yu, Z., TPBDSR: A new DSR-based energy saving routing in MANET 2003 (2003) International Conference on Computer Networks and Mobile Computing (ICCNMC 2003); Wu, W., Liaw, H., A Study on High Secure and Efficient MANET Routing Scheme (2015) Journal of Sensors, pp. 1-10; Barati, M., Atefi, K., Khosravi, F., Daftari, Y.A., Performance evaluation of energy consumption for AODV and DSR routing protocols in MANET (2012) 2012 International Conference on Computer & Information Science (ICCIS), p. 636; Elavarasipriyanka, S., Latha, V., Design of Routing Protocol for MANET Through Energy Optimization Technique (2015) International Journal of Innovations & Advancement in Computer Science, 4, pp. 173-180; Radwan, A., Mahmoud, T., Houssein, E., Evaluation comparison of some ad hoc networks routing protocols (2011) Egyptian Informatics Journal, 12 (2), pp. 95-106; Jadhav, S.S., Kulkarni, A.V., Menon, R., Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) for disaster management (2014) 2014 Eleventh International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks (WOCN), p. 1; Ya-Qin, F., Wen-Yong, F., Lin-Zhu, W., OPNET-based Network of MANET Routing Protocols DSR Computer Simulation (2010) 2010 WASE International Conference on Information Engineering, p. 46; Gupta, M., Kumar, S., Performance Evaluation of DSR, AODV and DSDV Routing Protocol for Wireless Adhoc Network (2015) 2015 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology; Mohapatra, S., Kanungo, P., Performance analysis of AODV, DSR, OLSR and DSDV Routing Protocols using NS2 Simulator (2012) Procedia Engineering, 30, pp. 69-76; Khediri, S.E., Nasri, N., Benfradj, A., Kachouri, A., Wei, A., Routing protocols in MANET: Performance comparison of AODV, DSR and DSDV protocols using NS2 (2014) The 2014 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications, p. 1; Gaharwar, P., Gupta, S.R., Performance Comparison of AODV, DSDV & DSR Routing Protocols in MANET (2013) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science and Software Engineering, 3, pp. 1059-1063",,,"Garuda Indonesia;PT.

The old method adaptation depend mostly on the calculations estimatations of probabilities and financial loss during a security breach. The purpose of this paper is to propose alternative ways to conduct risk analysis for small companies. Risk analysis defined in the paper is an analysis to identify such comprehensive risks set by concentrating by equal to the information and technology also not undermine the people and process area too. This method considers the essential business processes that focus for the relevance of the analysis. Crucial items for this practice consist of business-driven studies for identify relevant IT assets and risk method scenarios for capturing procedure details, and security. People involvement and tools selected for the analysis will be expected for result from set of risks that identified more comprehensively also for high increase of the security awareness to all of the organization. © 2020 IEEE.","Information security for small business; Risk analysis","Information management; Losses; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Security of data; Comprehensive risks; Educational platforms; Information and technologies; Information security requirements; Method adaptation; Security awareness; Security breaches; Technical assets; Risk analysis",,,,,"In, H.P., Kim, Y.G., Lee, T., Moon, C.J., Jung, Y., Kim, I., A security risk analysis model for information systems (2005) Lect.

Fraud in BPJS Kesehatan can be the source of loss if it not anticipated very well. Fraud can happen because of bad registration, no transparency in the data and minimum monitoring from third party outside the insurance components. This research consist of analysis and design of the fraud possibilities can be minimize and anticipated as much as possible. Blockchain is one of alternative method approach that can be applied for this matter because blockchain is good to analyze Big Data. Blockchain registered records by distributions, so that with the good records registration and distributed can minimize the possibility of the fraud. Based on the analysis result, identification and design that been made, proposed several actors, participants also activity process for each actor, business process, data requirement and transaction process that can minimize fraud in BPJS Kesehatan system. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

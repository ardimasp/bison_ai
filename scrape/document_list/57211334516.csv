Personal health is obtained by maintaining regular diet and exercise. However, because of the lack of public knowledge about balanced food intake and calorie requirements for daily activities, it is difficult for the community to determine the amount of calories consumed and burned. The author proposes the concept of a system that integrates Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)-based gym and logistics to solve this problem. This research methodology uses a systematic literature review. The results of this study are the big picture of service-based architecture which consists of nine layers, namely profile, order, catalog, payment, shipping, chat, diary, promotion and gym inventory. © 2019 IEEE.","Calorie Control Application; integration; Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)","Computer architecture; Information services; Integration; Nutrition; Control applications; Daily activity; Food intake; Personal health; Public knowledge; Research methodologies; Service-based; Systematic literature review; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,"(2015) Hanya 27% Penduduk Indonesia Rutin Berolahraga, , https://databoks.katadata.co.id/datapublish/2016/11/10/hanya-27-penduduk-Indonesia-rutin-berolahraga, Badan Pusat Statistik BPS.

At present the community must pay for the cost of rubbish, whereas rubbish can be useful and profitable if managed properly. One way to manage waste properly is to save waste at the Trash Bank. At present there are already several garbage banks established, but the garbage banks that have been run are not yet optimal, not all people use these facilities. Lack of knowledge and infrastructure facilities hamper the waste management process at the garbage bank. Therefore, the authors propose the concept of an integrated system based on service oriented architecture (SOA) to integrate garbage pickup services, banks, garbage banks, cooperatives, gas, electricity, cable tv, public relations, e-commerce and health insurance as a means of supporting infrastructure to support waste management. The method in this study uses Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The results of this study are in the form of a waste management application design: Go-Waste which integrates waste pick-up service, banks, garbage banks, cooperatives, gas, electricity, cable tv, public relations, e-commerce and health insurance in one platform using a service oriented architecture (SOA). © BEIESP.","Garbage bank; Service-oriented architecture (SOA); Waste management service information system",,,,,,"(2018), www.menlhk.go.id; (2018), www.litbang.kemendagri.go.id; Erl, T., (2005) Service-Oriented Architecture: Concepts, Technology, and Design, , Prentice Hall PTR; Walean, D.D., Sistem Informasi Akademik Berbasis Web Mobile Menggunakan ASP.NET (Studi Kasus Teknik Elektro UNSRAT) (2011) Manado.

The aim of this study was to observe haematological and inflammatory responses of iron-based intramedulary biodegradable implants. Eight sheep were divided into two groups according to the material implanted, which were the control group using stainless steel Steinman pin and treatment group using degradable iron-based pin. The pin was inserted into a transverse fracture of sheep tibial bone medullary cavity. Blood sampling was performed on jugular vein on day 0, 1, 3, 7, and 14 after implantation. The examination includes the number of erythrocytes, haematocrite values, hemoglobin levels, platelet values, the number of leukocytes, and leukocyte differential cell. Iron-based bone pin implantation did not cause significant changes on erythrocyte profile, leukocyte count and leukocyte differential cell when compared to stainless steel bone pin. The interaction between iron-based implant and bone tissue, acute and chronic inflammatory responses shows a dynamic variation. It can be concluded the iron-based implant is still tolerated sub-chronically in sheep. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Blood; Bone; Metal implants; Stainless steel; Biodegradable implants; Chronic inflammatory; Dynamic variations; Hemoglobin levels; Inflammatory response; Leukocyte counts; Metallic material; Orthopaedic implants; Iron",,,,,"For Health Research, A., Development, Health Research, B., (2013); Kopova, I., Strasky, J., Harcuba, P., Landa, M., Janecek, M., Bacakova, L., (2016) Mater Sci Eng C, 60, pp. 230-238; Ulum, M.F., Arafat, A., Noviana, D., Yusop, A.H., Nasution, A.H., Kadir, A., Hermawan, H., (2014) J.

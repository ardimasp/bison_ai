Although recently used, this information system needs to be evaluated to find out the benefits provided to users and what factors contribute to user ratings. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of E-PROSATA using Updated Information System Success Model DeLone & McLean. With as many as 100 respondents and using the PLS-SEM method, the results showed that users are satisfied with the performance of E-PROSATA and the users also state that EPROSATA has successfully overcome the problems encountered when using the previous information system. This study also found that 'System Quality' and 'Information Quality' have a significant influence on 'User Satisfaction', while 'Service Quality' has no significant effect on 'User Satisfaction'. Variable 'User Satisfaction' also has a positive and significant effect on the variable 'Net Benefits'. © 2018 IAEME Publication.","Effectiveness of information system; Information system success model; System quality; Technology management valuation; User satisfaction",,,,,,"Zhang, M.J., IS support for strategic flexibility, environmental dynamism, and firm performance (2006) Journal of Managerial Issues, pp. 84-103; Al-Mamary, Y.H., Shamsudin, A., Aziati, N., The impact of management information systems adoption in managerial decision making: A review (2013) Management Information System, 8 (4), pp. 010-017; Garrison, G., Wakefield, R.L., Kim, S., The effects of IT capabilities and delivery model on cloud computing success and firm performance for cloud supported processes and operations (2015) Internatioanl Journal of Information Management, 35, pp. 377-393; Kohli, R., Business value of IT: An essay on expanding research directions to keep up with the times (2008) Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 9 (1), pp. 23-39; Qrunfleh, S., Tarafdar, M., Supply chain information systems strategy: Impacts on supply chain performance and firm performance (2012) International Journal Production Economics, pp. 1-11; De-Waal, A., Kourtit, K., Performance measurement and management in practice: Advantages, disadvantages and reasons for use (2013) Internationa Journal of Productivity and Performance Management, 62 (5), pp. 446-473; Gable, G., Sedera, D., Chan, T., Enterprise systems success: A measurement model (2003) ICIS Proceedings, 48, pp. 576-591; Petter, S., De-Lone, W., McLean, E., Measuring information system success: Models, diemensions, measures and interrelationships (2008) European Journal of Information Systems, 17, pp. 236-263; Schwalbe, K., (2012) Information Technology Project Management, p. 14. , 7th edition, Cengage Learning; De-Lone, W.H., McLean, E.R., Information systems success measurement (2016) Foundations and Trends in Information Systems, 2 (1), pp. 1-116; Sánchez, R.A., Hueros, A.D., Motivational factors that influence the acceptance of moodle using TAM (2010) Computers in Human Behavior, 26, pp. 1632-1640; Jaradat, M.-I.R., Al-Mashaqba, A.M., Understanding the adoption and usage of mobile payment services by using TAM3 (2014) Int.

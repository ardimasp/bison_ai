It proposes kernel density analysis of artificial intelligence approach to industry 4.0. Regulation for technology developments in artificial intelligence and robotics are deemed as one of beneficial yet structurally neglected domain. This domain refers to human perspective on augmenting automation. This regulation was emphasized in 2017 by the European Parliament report level. The mentioned regulation comprises attention in Indonesia transportation industry indicating positive innovation domains in term of safeguards and regulations are needed. Prior, current and posterior trends of the Internet of Things, Industry 4.0, and Physical Internet constitutes the results of the data development and understanding. Therefore, the topical framework of automation and robotics are triggered by these developments. The mention triggers has impacted the most important wide range implementation of industries in the future. Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) system is 40% higher in cost efficiency than Manual Toll Collection (MTC) system. In this situation, Indonesian government has already issued full swing policy implementation on non-contact freeway toll collection system by the end of 2018. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is capitalized to proceed to data processing. Result of this research shown the driver's characteristics that significantly affect willingness to pay an on-board unit are education expenses, distance and frequency. The average value of driver willing to pay an on-board unit was 225.781 IDR and factors that affecting values of the willingness to pay an on-board unit are expenses and distance. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

This paper presents the application of an open source spreadsheet solver in single depot routing problem. This study focuses on Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) Company as a case study. The objective of this research is to minimize the distance travel. This research begins by collecting data from a respective FMCG Company. A FMCG company based in Jakarta, Indonesia provides drinking water packaged in gallon. This FMCG Company have two distributions characteristic. Head office distribution was used in this case study due to highest internally rejected by company such as un-routed order, no visit, not enough time to visit and transportation issue. Based on computational results, overall solutions to delivered 214 gallons to 26 customers having total distance travelled 56.76 km, total driving time 2 hour and 49 minutes, total driver working time 7 hours and 57 minutes. Total savings of distances travelled between current route and the proposed solutions using open source spreadsheet solver is 7.25 km. As a result, an open source spreadsheet solver can be implemented in FMCG Company for single depot routing problem. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Driving time limit; Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG); Spreadsheet solver;

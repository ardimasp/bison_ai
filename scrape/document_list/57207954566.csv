Many systems that have been connected to this system has complexity of integration. SOA using enterprise service bus (ESB) is one way to manage the integration of information systems. ESB is a software infrastructure that can solve complexity problems with n-to-n integration, where n is the number of integrated applications. The business case has been implemented each function of services and ESB. The results obtained show that each services and ESB has its own strengths and weakness. As regards strengths, it should be noted that ESB copes very well with both kinds of files and small and large size but put the effort if the application of ESB is not working well it can be affected to another application system. N-to-n integration performs as good enough with small files and size but need to manage if there were any add or updated with the service. This research implemented SOA using ESB to proves to be a good choice for integration solution in a business environment with a large number of users and diversified communications. © IAEME Publication.","Airline; Enterprise Service Bus; Integration; Performance; SOA",,,,,,"Ueasangkomsate, P., (2015) Adoption E-Commerce for Export Market of Small and Medium Enterprises in Thailand; Arridha, R.R., Mohamed, H., Elias, N.F., The determinants of airline online services satisfaction: A conceptual model (2014) International Conference on Computer and Information Sciences (ICCOINS), , Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Mouakket, S., Investigating the motives of customers’ continuance intentions towards online reservation: The role of e-service quality (2014) Journal of Organizational and End User Computing, 26 (2), pp. 18-40; Vilkaite-Vaitone, N., Papsiene, P., Influence of customer loyalty program on organizational performance: A case of airline industry (2016) Economics, 27 (1), pp. 109-116. , March; Uddin, N., Leon, S., Airline ancillary services: An investigation into passenger purchase behavior (2017) The Transportation Research Forum, 56; Kaewrattanapat, N., Nookhong, J., (2017) Recruitment Agency Based on SOA and XML, 8; Kavitha, V., Shanmugapriya, D.P., Dhayalan, D.V., Business Process Management system using SOA (2017) Advances in Computational Sciences and Technology, 10, pp. 1457-1462; Chang, T.-K., Hwang, E.T.Y., An SOA-based system modeling methodology (2015) Journal of Internet Technology, 16, pp. 547-561. , 15 May; Górski, T., Pietrasik, K., Performance analysis of Enterprise Service Buses (2017) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Computer Science, 10, pp. 16-32; RajKumar, N., Vinod, V., Integrated Educational Information Systems for Disabled Schools via a Service Bus using SOA (2015) Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 8 (13). , July; Sri, S.A., Priyadarsini, R., Digital campus information system based on SOA using aspect oriented software development (2015) International Journal of Technology and Engineering System, 7 (2), pp. 130-133; You, Y., Xu, Y., Wang, L., Car service spare parts procurement process improvements based on SOA (2016) Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 3 (3), pp. 554-563. , September; Wei, N., Research on an information application integration platform based on SOA and web service (2015) International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering, 10, pp. 165-174; Ma, X., Yao, Q.-B., Shan, S., The study and application of system integration based on ESB for enterprise group (2017) International Conference on Wireless Communication and Network Engineering (WCNE 2017), , Xiamen, Chia",,,,"IAEME Publication",,,,,09766308,,,,"English","Int.J.

The e-voucher is used as a flight ticket payment instead of cash payment to buy a ticket. The e-voucher consists of some attributes such as destination, flown date, and flight class. Particularly, a marketing manager needs to review the utilization of e-voucher when a ticket has been approved in every year. The proposed solution is to redeploy existing OLTP database into data warehouse. The data warehouse already developed using nine-step Kimball’s methodology. All data will be analyzed using OLAP to present a report in a visual form such as dashboard. Furthermore, airlines company can produce an analysis report using business intelligence. © IAEME Publication","Business Intelligence; Data Warehouse; ETL; Pentaho System; Reporting",,,,,,"Al-Debei, M.M., Data warehouse as a backbone for business intelligence: Issues and challenges (2011) European Journal of Economics, Finance and Administrative Sciences, 33; Watson, H.J., BI-based Organizations (2010) Business Intelligence Journal, 15 (2); Xiao, B., Cheng, G., (2015) The Research Of Teradata Data Warehouse Technology, , IEEE; Parra, V.M., Mohammad, A., Syed, A., Halgamuge, M.N., Pentaho and Jaspersoft: A comparative study of business intelligence open source tools processing big data to evaluate performances (2016) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 7 (10); Chung, P.-T., Chung, S.H., (2013) On Data Integration and Data Mining for Developing Business Intelligence, , IEEE; Tarnaveanu, D., Pentaho Business Analytics: A business intelligence open source alternative (2012) Database Systems Journal, 3 (3). , III,. 2012,. 3; Tutunea, M.F., Rus, R.V., Business intelligence solutions for SME's (2012) International Conference Emerging Markets Queries in Finance and Business, , Romania; Data warehousing as a healthcare business solution (1998) Healthcare Financial Management: Journal of The Healthcare Financial Management Association, 52 (2), pp. 56-59. , S.

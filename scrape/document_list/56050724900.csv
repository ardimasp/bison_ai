Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a descriptive literature review on laws and regulations related to sustainability reporting in Japan and Indonesia followed by an interpretive approach in the analysis. Findings: Laws and regulations in Japan can lead to focus on the environmental aspect of sustainability. Laws and regulations in Indonesia can lead to variations in all aspects of sustainability reporting. All types of institutional isomorphism are possible investment system pressures. Practical implications: This paper redefines issues in sustainability reporting based on the reporting environment created by laws and regulations in Japan and Indonesia. Originality/value: This study assists researchers and investment analysts in understanding inherent reporting issues because of laws and regulations in both countries, and it expands existing theory for voluntary and mandatory reporting interaction studies. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Indonesia; Japan; Laws; Regulations; Reporting; Sustainability",,,,,"United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security

A 2016 report titled “Carrot and Sticks: Global Trends in Sustainability Reporting Regulation and Policy” which was sponsored by KPMG International, United Nations Environment Programme, Global Reporting Initiatives and the Centre for Corporate Governance in Africa detects an increase in mandated sustainability instruments.","First, the Act on the Promotion of Business Activities with Environmental Consideration by Specified Corporations, etc., by Facilitating Access to Environmental Information and Other Measures focuses on “specified corporations”. This kind of corporation refers, in accordance with the ministerial ordinance, to a business operator who receives a grant from the Japanese Government and the subsidy, as of 1 October 2016, refers to the 88 “Independent Administrative Agencies” that are stipulated by the Act on General Rules for Incorporated Administrative Agencies (Act No. 103 of 1999), including Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and the University of Tokyo. “Large enterprises” refers to corporations other than small and medium-sized enterprises, excluding “specified corporations”.","The Cabinet Office Ordinance on the Disclosure of Corporate Affairs, which is under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, targets the issuers of securities listed on financial instruments and exchanges, securities registered at stores or other prescribed securities. The Charter of Corporate Behavior of the Japan Business Federation covers 1,340 representative companies in Japan, 109 organisations of major industries including the manufacturing and service industries and 47 groups of regional economic organisations.","Andrade, A.D., Interpretive research aiming at theory building: adopting and adapting the case study design (2009) The Qualitative Report, 14 (1), pp. 42-60; Archel, P., Husillos, J., Larrinaga, C., Spence, C., Social disclosure, legitimacy theory and the role of the state (2009) Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal, 22 (8), pp. 1284-1307; Arli, D., Tjiptono, F., Does corporate social responsibility matter to consumer in Indonesia (2014) Social Responsibility Journal, 10 (3), pp. 537-549; Bebbington, J., Larrinaga-González, C., Moneva-Abadía, J.M., Legitimating reputation/the reputation of legitimacy theory (2008) Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal, 21 (3), pp. 371-374; Beddewela, E., Fairbrass, J., Seeking legitimacy through CSR: institutional pressures and corporate responses of multinationals in Sri Lanka (2016) Journal of Business Ethics, 136 (3), pp. 503-522; Bengtsson, E., A history of Scandinavian socially responsible investing (2008) Journal of Business Ethics, 82 (4), pp. 969-983; Buhmann, K., Public regulators and CSR: the social license to operate in recent united nations instruments on business and human rights and the juridification of CSR (2016) Journal of Business Ethics, 136 (4), pp. 699-714; Chen, J.C., Roberts, R.W., Toward a more coherent understanding of the organization-Society Relationship: a theoretical consideration for social and environmental accounting research (2010) Journal of Business Ethics, 97 (4), pp. 651-665; Chen, S., Bouvain, P., Is corporate responsibility converging?

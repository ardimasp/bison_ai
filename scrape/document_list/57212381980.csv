Key performance indicator (KPI) in the maintenance processes are defined and applied as maintenance process' measurement. The purpose of this research is to define the critical KPI of maintenance process to improve the quality of service management. In this research, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is implemented from the previous studies (33 papers) related to the selection of KPI in the maintenance processes. This paper found that the most important KPI in maintenance is Availability that also becomes a leading indicator. Besides availability, there also some of KPI of maintenance such as Mean Time Between Stoppages (MTBS), Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), Maintainability, Safety, Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), Reliability, Performance Rate, Quality Rate, Maintenance Time, etc. The popular method to find KPI in maintenance is based on the theories from the existing literature, AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process), and interview the subject matter expertise in some companies. © 2019, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

In this paper, we will extract audio features from music, and then used that features for classification based on machine learning methods. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used in this study. In this paper's experiment we use 32 audio music files, consisting of 16 for dangdut music and 16 for techno dance music. The results of this testing get varying accuracy levels, between 80% to 90% for each music audio file that has been successfully classified. © 2018 IEEE.","dangdut music classification; machine learning; Support Vector Machine","Classification (of information); Learning systems; Machine learning; Pattern recognition; Support vector machines; Accuracy level; Audio features; Audio files; Audio music; Music classification; On-machines; Audio acoustics",,,,,"https://lifestyle.sindonews.com/read/1264422/157/dangdut-jawa-koplo-mengorbit-tinggi-1512890757, Dangdut Jawa Koplo mengorbit tinggi, retrieved 28 August 2018 from; http://www.tribunnews.com/seleb/2018/01/24/dari-dangdut-koplo-bisa-tenar-ini-sejarahnya-musik-dengan-lirik-galau-mengundang-goyang, Dari dangdut koplo bisa tenar ini sejarahnya musik dengan lirik galau mengundang goyang, retrieved 28 August 2018 from; https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Electronic%20Music, Top definition Electronic Music, retrieved 28 August 2018 from; Markov, K., Matsui, T., Music genre and emotion recognition using Gaussian processes (2014) IEEE Access, 2, pp. 688-698; Kalapatapu, P., Goli, S., Arthum, P., Malapati, A., A study on feature selection and classification techniques of indian music (2016) The 7th International Conference on Emerging Ubiquitous Systems and Pervasive Networks (EUSPN 2016), pp. 125-131; Khonglah, B.K., Prasanna, S.R.M., Speech/music classification using speech-specific features (2016) Digital Signal Processing, 48, pp. 71-83; Jondya, A.G., Iswanto, B.H., Indonesian's traditional music clustering based on audio features (2017) 2nd International Conference on Computer Science and Computational Intelligence (ICCSCI), pp. 174-181. , Bali, Indonesia, 13-14 October 2017; Hsiao, S.-W., Chen, S.-K., Lee, C.-H., Methodology for stage lighting control based on music emotions (2017) Information Sciences, 412-413, pp. 14-35; Nanni, L., Costa, Y.M.G., Lumini, A., Kim, M.Y., Baek, S.R., Combining visual and acoustic features for music genre classification (2016) Expert Systems with Applications, 45, pp. 108-117; Lacerda, E.B., Mello, C.A.B., Automatic classification of laryngeal mechanisms in singing based on the audio signal (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 112, pp. 2204-2212; https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dangdut+koplo; Boersma, P., Weenink, D., (2018) Praat: Doing Phonetics by Computer [Computer Program].

Supplying hydrogen for mobile vehicles is becoming of interest since storing compressed hydrogen in the bottle is not only dangerous but also energy consuming. One way to overcome the drawback is by performing the ethanol steam reforming in situ. In this way, microreactor offers the potential benefit to convert ethanol to hydrogen due to very fast mass and heat transfer. Fluid dynamics inside the microreactors and the kinetic aspects for ethanol steam reforming using Pt/Al2O3 catalyst were investigated with aim to determine the proper microreactor design having uniform fluid distribution and to study the influence of reaction temperature, fluid velocity, and reactor length. It was found that placing an obstacle inside the microreactors in certain position gave more uniform distribution of fluid flow. The reaction temperature and fluid velocity showed their influence on hydrogen productivity. © 2014 IEEE.","Computational fluid dynamic; ethanol steam reforming; kinetic; microchannel reactor; PEMFC; simulation","Bottles; Chemical reactors; Computational fluid dynamics; Ethanol; Flow of fluids; Fluid dynamics; Fuel cells; Heat transfer; Hydrogen; Kinetics; Microchannels; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Steam; Structural design; Transportation; Compressed hydrogens; Ethanol steam reforming; Mass and heat transfers; Micro channel reactors; Reaction temperature; simulation; Steam reforming of ethanol; Uniform distribution; Steam reforming",,,,,"Kim, T., Micro power generation from micro fuel cell combined with micro methanol reformer (2009) Micro Electronic and Mechanical Systems, pp. 25-50; Peighambardoust, S.J., Rowshanzamir, S., Amjadi, M., Review of the proton exchange membranes for fuel cell applications (2010) International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 35, pp. 9349-9384; Jang, J.Y., Cheng, C.H., Huang, Y.X., Lee, C.I., Leu, C.H., Optimal design of parallel channel patterns in a micro methanol steam reformer (2012) International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 37, pp. 16974-16985; Palma, V., Castaldo, F., Ciambelli, P., Iaquaniello, G., Sustainable hydrogen production by catalytic bio-ethanol steam reforming (2012) Greenhouse Gases - Capturing, Utilization and Reduction, pp. 137-214; Moharana, M.K., Peela, N.R., Khandekar, S., Kunzru, D., Distributed hydrogen production from ethanol in a microfuel processor: Issues and challenges (2011) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 15, pp. 524-533; Ehrfeld, W., Hessel, V., Lowe, H., (2000) Microreactors, , 1st Ed., WILEY-VCH, Germany; Holladay, J.D., Wainright, S., Jones, O., Gano, R., Power generation using a mesoscale fuel cell integrated with microscale fuel processor (2004) Journal of Power Sources, 130, pp. 111-118; Torres, J.A., Montane, D., Model for steam reforming of ethanol using a catalytic wall reactor (2008) The COMSOL Conference; Wu, Y.J., Santos, J.C., Li, P., Yu, J.G., Cunha, A.F., Rodrigues, A.E., Simplified kinetic model for steam reforming of ethanol on a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst (2014) The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering, 92, pp. 116-130; Gorke, O., Preifer, P., Schubert, K., Kinetic study of ethanol reforming in a microreactor (2009) Applied Catalysis, 360, pp. 232-241",,,"Directorate Genaral of Higher Education","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1st International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, ICEECS 2014","24 November 2014 through 25 November 2014",,111066,,9781479984770,,,"English","Proc.

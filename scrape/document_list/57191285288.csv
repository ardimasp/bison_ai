The formulated glucomannan–beeswax–chitosan edible coating is applied to minimally processed salak, and the characteristics of the edible coating are evaluated. The glucomannan–beeswax–chitosan edible coating not just successfully reduces the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (10%, compared to control, that is, the salak fruit coated with glucomannan only), but also decreases the water vapor transfer rate that penetrates salak fruit (by 27% vs control), and lowers the weight loss of salak fruit (<4%, compared to that of control (10% weight loss)). Peeled salak fruit coated with glucomannan–beeswax–chitosan maintains its quality at room temperature in 3 days, without any indication of mold growth. Based on the results in this study, glucomannan–beeswax–chitosan edible coating is a promising antimicrobial edible polymer coating for minimally processed salak fruit, and possibly for other varieties of fruits. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

With the addition of ZnO nanoparticles of 0.048% w/w in a solution containing 4% gelatin, the fabricated bionanocomposite film decreases the water vapor transfer rate by 27.54%, increases the tensile strength by 61.32%, reduces polymer film elongation by 60%, and inhibits the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli by more than 90%, compared to control (gelatin coating with 0% ZnO NPs). When applied to broiler chicken fillet stored in room temperature for 8 h, the gelatin–ZnO NPs 0.048% w/w bionanocomposite polymeric edible coating has the lowest weight loss rate of 17%, maintains hardness at around 80 N, stabilizes the pH of the coated chicken at 6, without any indication of rancidity or slime, with total microorganisms (4.23 log CFU mL−1) significantly below the limit set by Indonesian National Standard SNI 01–3924:2009 (5 log CFU mL−1).

The microbial EPS are utilized in various application such as wastewater treatment, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and food industry mostly as flocculant, thickener, and emulsifier.

Moreover, packaging materials with antimicrobial properties give advantages to prolong the shelf life of perishable foodstuff. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a water-soluble polymer, which has good oxygen barrier properties, but this depends on the humidity, as PVA is sensitive to moisture. The purpose of this study was to assess the characterization of bio-based nanocomposite films of PVA with the addition of ZnO nanoparticles and stearic acid. Bionanocomposite films were prepared by PVA dissolving in distilled and a range of ZnO nanoparticle formulations (and/or stearic acid) was added. Response Surface Methodology data analysis showed all response models qualified as good models with adequate presision (greater than 4). Result revealed that the addition of ZnO nanoparticles and/or stearic acid can reduce the water vapor transmission rate of the resulting film, lower light transmission, as well as results in antimicrobial properties. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

During the distribution and storage, mango is potentially susceptible to both physical and biological deterioration. In this study, a coating method is applied to reduce quality loss of mango. Mango was coated by conventional carrageenan coating in combination with ZnO nanoparticles (0, 0.5, and 1% by weight of carrageenan) as filler. The results revealed that the elongation parameter of the carrageenan/ZnO nanoparticles (CZ) nanocomposite film are not significantly increase compared to that of carrageenan film, while the tensile strength increased and water vapor transmission rate decreased significantly. The incorporation of ZnO nanoparticles transformed the ordinary carrageenan coating to have antimicrobial properties against Escherichia coli as well. Finally, these qualities exhibited by the CZ 1 coatings could maintain the shelf life of fresh whole fruit of mango. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carrageenan; Coating; Mango; Nanocomposite; ZnO nanoparticles",,,,,,"We thank the financial support provided by Agro-Nanotechnology 2014/2015 consorcium project between Indonesian Agency for Agricultural Postharvest Research and Development cooperated with Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia .

In this study, generation of a new edible coating was chosen as an alternative method for preserving the quality attributes of fresh-cut mango. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of nanocomposite edible coating from cassava starch (SC), stearic acid (SA) and/or ZnO nanoparticles (NP-ZnO) on the quality of fresh-cut mango cv. Arumanis, stored for 12 days at 8°C. The formulations of 20 g/L SC, 6 g/L SA, and variable NP-ZnO (0, 1, 2% w/w of SC) were utilized to coat the fresh-cut mango. The result revealed that the treatment of nanocomposite edible coating was able to maintain the quality of fresh-cut mango during the storage periods.

The ZnO NPs (0.5 and 1%w/w carrageenan) and beeswax (3%v/v), as hydrophobic component, were incorporated into carrageenan polymer to produced bionanocomposite films. The resulting films were characterized using SEM. The physical and mechanical properties of films were also investigated. The addition of ZnO NPs and beeswax resulted in different morphological surface as well as influenced the surface color of carrageenan film. Incorporation of ZnO NPs increased TS and EAB of the film, while WVTR decreased. Furthermore, the presence of beeswax within the carrageenan and or its nanocomposite films promoted synergistic effect with ZnO NPs in reducing WVTR and EAB, however decreased TS of films. Therefore, these bionanocomposite films were potentially used in packaging industry to maintain the quality of food stuffs. © 2016 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Beeswax; Biopolymer; Carrageenan; Nanocomposite; ZnO nanoparticles","Biomolecules; Biopolymers; Film preparation; Food products; II-VI semiconductors; Metal nanoparticles; Nanocomposites; Polymer films; Waxes; Zinc oxide; ZnO nanoparticles; Beeswax; Bionanocomposite films; Carrageenans; Hydrophobic components; Packaging industry; Physical and mechanical properties; Surface colors; Synergistic effect; Nanocomposite films",,,,,,"Shojaee-Aliabadi, S., Hosseini, H., Mohammadifar, M.A., Mohammadi, A., Ghasemlou, M., Hosseini, S.M., Khaksar, R., (2014) Carbohydr.

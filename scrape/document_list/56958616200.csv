This study suggested an intelligent logistics design that infused technological indicators with logistics performance indices (LPIs) to minimize carbon damages in a panel of 102 countries. The study used patent applications and trademark applications to analyze the technological progress, whereas LPIs-i.e., LPI-1 for assessing quality and competence services, and LPI-2 for trade and transport infrastructure-are used to determine supply chain management process across countries. The results show that carbon damages follow a U-shaped structure with technology-induced LPIs (TI-LPIs) and GDP per capita. The country's GDP per capita and TI-LPIs decrease carbon damages up to US$15,000,000, while the moderation of patents application (and trademark applications) with LPI1 and LPI2 substantially decreases carbon damages up to US$13,800,000 (US$34,100,000) and US$6,100,000 (US$20,200,000), respectively. The causality estimates confirmed the growth-led carbon damages, technology-led carbon damages, growth-led logistics indices, and technology-led growth across countries. The results emphasized the need to move forward by adopting fuel-efficient technologies to minimize carbon damages across countries. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon damages; Differenced panel GMM; Economic growth; Green supply chain management; Logistics performance indices; Technological factors",,,,,,"This research received no external funding.",,"(2015) Sustainable Development Goals, , https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300, (accessed on 21 April 2020); Zand, F., Yaghoubi, S., Sadjadi, S.J., Impacts of government direct limitation on pricing, greening activities and recycling management in an online to offline closed loop supply chain (2019) J.

The research method used in this study is the mixed-methods with the steps of research and development (RnD) followed by quantitative and qualitative data for implementing the product. The study was conducted in the remote areas at three high schools in East Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara Province, Indonesia. This research has developed a prototype of mobile learning media by integrating the Ethnopedagogy approach. The research shows that the prototype the mobile learning can be used in chemistry learning in the remote area. The effectiveness of using mobile learning based on ethnopedagogy approach shows that learning by using full mobile learning provided better results compared with using blended learning and the use of mobile learning as a complement. This shows that the use of mobile learning based on ethnopedagogy approach is suitable for students in remote areas who face difficulties in accessing learning resources, engaging in local culture, lack of teaching staff, low motivation, and low parental support to achieve maximum learning achievement.

The lesson learnt can be captured through the formulation of strategy that needed to consider internal and external aspects. For example, as in the digital world, customer experience as well as customer satisfaction. Capability on the side of the network owned combined with network and social capabilities are expected to create distinctive organizational capability. Based on this background, the study aims to examine the effects of customer experience and distinctive organizational capability on the business model innovations of telecommunication firms in Indonesia using quantitative research. The target population are 445 telecommunication network companies in Indonesia which includes 312 ISP firms, 34 satellite firms, 27 tower firms, and 72 Telkom subsidiaries and affiliates, with samples taken from 34 firms. PLS is used as the analytical tool to process the data in this study. The results of the study show that customer experience and distinctive organizational capabilities have an influence to business model innovations. Customer experience has a bigger role than distinctive organizational capability in building business model innovation. These findings have practical implications for the management of telecommunications industries in Indonesia as the development of vocational training rely on the needs of business model innovation development, which directly based on the development of customer experience and supported with development of distinctive organizational capability. Further research can be explored by expanding the sample, industry and in other countries. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.","Business model innovation; Customer experience; Distinctive organization capability; Telecommunication industry",,,,,,,,"Abdelkafi, N., Makhotin, S., Posselt, T., Business Model Innovations for Electric Mobility — What Can Be Learned from Existing Business Model Patterns?

The research method uses mixed methods Neuroresearch that is explanatory research. The population is the inhabitants of all housing complexes throughout Jabodetabek. Sampling technique used is random cluster sampling. The number of residents in 94 housing complexes taken randomly is 753 households. The results showed that the architect was considered by the community to be quite adaptive to the disaster risk mitigation seen in their housing design. There are two important aspects to be able to improve this perception, namely architects need to understand various current threats and understand how rescue mitigation can be done when a disaster occurs. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","architect's adaptive capacity; disaster; public perception","Disasters; Housing; Adaptive capacity; Cluster sampling; Housing design; Public perception; research methods; Risk mitigation; Safety standard; Sampling technique; Architectural design",,,,"Binus University","This work is partially supported by Research Interest Group in Educational Technology, Bina Nusantara University.

The authors seek to examine the technological impact as part of digital transformation antecedents of CX and OA in developing DSI. The study also aims to investigate the digital transformation model to attain a more sustainableICT performance in Indonesia. The novelty of this study lies in the identifying and testing the concurrent effects of studied variables in improving the understanding of DSI and SP as part of the Indonesian ICT digital transformation model. The study used a sample of 195 Indonesia ICT firms. The finding from PLS-SEM reveals that GIS has a significant moderating role in accelerating the development ofDSI on the relationship with CX and OA, while SP is positively and significantly influenced by CS, OA and DSI. The implication and the proposed of digital transformation model for Indonesian ICT firms is also discussed in this paper. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Information services;

It was supported by the strength of existing firms, which is corporate reputation. The concept of co-creation-innovation itself is based on the theory of service dominant (S-D) logic. Past studies have focused on the critical elements of co-creation (CC) and digital service innovation (DSI), as well as corporate reputation (CR) in shaping a sustainable performance (SP). However, the study of co-creation-innovation and CR and its relationship to green environment has not been intensively explored. This study has aim to oversee the role of Green Information System (GIS; Green IS) in the development of corporate reputation and co-creation-innovation in order to attain sustainable performance. The study was conducted using a sample size of 195 respondents representing Indonesian telecommunication firms. Smart PLS was used as the statistical tool for analyses. Findings demonstrate that green IS directly and indirectly has a significant relationship on corporate reputation, CC and DSI. However, CR has a direct impact on CC but no direct impact on DSI.

Prevention efforts will be realized when everyone has awareness and preparedness for the disaster itself. For architects, preparedness to face an earthquake is important because it can be felt in the implementation of their work that is utilized by the community. This study wants to see Architect's Earthquake Readiness as a measurement of how responsive architects are in preparing for disasters in their work. The research method is Neuroresearch method with survey techniques. The results show that the main dimension that forms Architect's Earthquake Readiness is current prevention that is supported by a commitment to change, namely a commitment to turn their work into a work that accommodates preparations in the face of earthquake disasters. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Architect; Architect's Earthquake Readiness; Earthquake Readiness","Architecture; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Architect; Architect's Earthquake Readiness; Earthquake disaster; Natural disasters; Psychological damage; research methods; Survey techniques; Earthquakes",,,,"Binus University","This work is partially supported by Research Interest Group in Educational Technology, Bina Nusantara University.

Business performance is influenced by various factors needed to improve managerial skills such as market orientation, learning orientation, entrepreneurial orientation, and technology orientation. This study aims to observe the business performance of the company leadership in the Ready to Wear Fashion Industry in Indonesia. The research method is neuro-research, which combines qualitative and quantitative research. Neuro-research is considered appropriate for the present study because the study involves three stages: an exploratory research stage, which involves qualitative research that seeks to produce theoretical constructs that fit the population context, and explanatory and confirmatory research stages, which use quantitative research to prove the hypothesis. The data collection is done using the Likert Rating Scale ordinal scale. Instrument analysis is done using Orthogonal Iteration and/or the Rasch Model. Prior to hypothesis testing, we first test the data normality and test deviation from linearity. The results show that the performance of the ready to wear fashion industry in Indonesia is in the middle level, but all the leaders have a very good learning orientation. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt.

Therefore, the objective of the current study is to investigate the factors which limits the implementation of IoT. Additionally, the moderating role of employee innovative capabilities is also considered. A survey was carried out in the Indonesian engineering companies for data collection. Data collection was carried out form the employees of these companies. After data collection, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyse the data with the help of Partial Least Square (PLS). Findings of the study demonstrated that there are five key factors which effect the IoT implementation. These factors include; willingness to use, hardware characteristics, replacement of existing technology, failure threat and implementation cost. All these factors have the ability to influence IoT implementation. Additionally, employee innovative capability also has the ability to encourage or discourage the IoT implementation. Therefore, this study is most significant for the engineering industry of Indonesia as it provides the influencing factors towards IoT implementation. © 2020-IOS Press and the authors.","implementation; Industry 4.0; innovative capabilities; Internet of things (IoT); willingness to use","Data acquisition; Personnel; Engineering companies; Engineering industries; Hardware characteristics; Implementation cost; Innovative capability; Internet of Things (IOT); Partial least square (PLS); Structural equation modeling; Internet of things",,,,,,,"Radanliev, P., DeRoure, D.C., Nurse, J.R., Montalvo, R.M., Burnap, P., The industrial internet-of-Things in the industry 4. 0 supply chains of small and medium sized enterprises (2019) University of Oxford; Radanliev, P., (2019) New Developments in Cyber Physical Systems, the Internet of Things and the Digital Economy-discussion on Future Developments in the Industrial Internet of Things and Industry, 40; Chowdhury, A., Raut, S.A., Benefits, challenges, and opportunities in adoption of industrial iot (2019) International Journal of Computational Intelligence & IoT, 2 (4); Fernandez, F., Pallis, G.C., Opportunities and challenges of the internet of things for healthcare: Systems engineering perspective (2014) 2014 4th International Conference on Wireless Mobile Communication and Healthcare-Transforming Healthcare through Innovations in Mobile and Wireless Technologies (MOBIHEALTH, pp. 263-266; Bargshady, G., Alipanah, F., Abdulrazzaq, A.W., Chukwunonso, F., Business inteligence technology implimentation readiness factors (2014) Jurnal Teknologi, 68 (3); Curtis, M.B., Payne, E.A., An examination of contextual factors and individual characteristics affecting technology implementation decisions in auditing (2008) International Journal of Accounting Information Systems, 9 (2), pp. 104-121; Akman, G., Yilmaz, C., Innovative capability, innovation strategy and market orientation: An empirical analysis in Turkish software industry (2008) International Journal of Innovation Management, 12 (1), pp. 69-111; Rahmani, A.M., Exploiting smart e-health gateways at the edge of healthcare internet-of-Things: A fog computing approach (2018) Future Generation Computer Systems, 78, pp. 641-658; Santoro, G., Vrontis, D., Thrassou, A., Dezi, L., The internet of things: Building a knowledge management system for open innovation and knowledge management capacity (2018) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 136, pp. 347-354; Manogaran, G., Varatharajan, R., Lopez, D., Kumar, P.M., Sundarasekar, R., Thota, C., A new architecture of internet of things and big data ecosystem for secured smart healthcare monitoring and alerting system (2018) Future Generation Computer Systems, 82, pp. 375-387; Iftikhar, S., Saqib, A., Sarwar, M.R., Sarfraz, M., Arafat, M., Capacity and willingness to use information technology for managing chronic diseases among patients: A crosssectional study in lahore, Pakistan (2019) PloS One, 14 (1), p. 0209654; Beldad, A.D., Hegner, S.M., Expanding the technology acceptance model with the inclusion of trust, social influence, and health valuation to determine the predictors of German users' willingness to continue using a fitness app: A structural equation modeling approach (2018) International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 34 (9), pp. 882-893; Manis, K.T., Choi, D., The virtual reality hardware acceptance model (vr-ham): Extending and individuating the technology acceptance model (tam) for virtual reality hardware (2018) Journal of Business Research; Bi, Y., Gaillardon, P.-E., Hu, X.S., Niemier, M., Yuan, J.-S., Jin, Y., Leveraging emerging technology for hardware security-case study on silicon nanowire fets and graphene symfets (2014) 2014 Ieee 23rd Asian Test Symposium, pp. 342-347; Suryanegara, M., Arifin, A.S., Asvial, M., Ramli, K., Nashiruddin, M.I., Hayati, N., What are the Indonesian concerns about the internet of things (iot)?

The condition of vocational education disparities in Indonesia is very high. Teachers who are really involved and have competence in the vocational field are needed. That is, the teacher experiences a unified whole within himself between the profession, professionalism, self-capacity and work itself which shows the totality of work but not workaholics called the Indonesian Vocational Teacher Engagement (I-VOCATIE). There are two formulations of the problem, namely: (a) what is the tendency of the condition of vocational teacher engagement in Indonesia? and (b) what is the most powerful dimension determining the formation of vocational teacher engagement in Indonesia? The research design was deployed a surveying method using the Neuroresearch model. The Neuroresearch method is a research method developed by Sasmoko which is a mixed method which consists of three research phases, namely exploratory research, explanatory research and exploratory research. These three stages can be done at once and can also be done alone. In this paper, we only used two stages, there are exploratory research and explanatory research. It was based on multistage sampling technique, the total sample of 856 vocational teachers in 30 provinces in Indonesia were managed to be collected. Data collection techniques with a Likert scale questionnaire ranging from 1 to 5. The results of the study: (a) vocational teachers in Indonesia tend to have internalized teacher professional status and the profession has become an interesting thing teachers develop significantly at α <0.05, and (b ) Nation Character (Nat_Char_X4) is the most powerful dimension determining the formation of vocational teacher engagement in Indonesia (Voc_TeachE_Y). Increasing the teacher's performance will improve the nation character of vocational teachers. 2020 UTHM Publisher.","IR 4.0; Neuroresearch; Teacher competencies; Teacher engagement",,,,,"Binus University","This work is partially supported by Bina Nusantara University, the Indonesian Ministry of Research and Higher Education for supporting this research.

In order to make the quality of Chinese Indonesian Literature graduates to be in accordance with the needs of the workforce, a study of the relevance of the hard skills ability of Chinese Literature graduates to the needs of the workforce needs to be done. This research focuses on the ability of hard skills needed to work as managers, translators, administrators and trainers. This research uses quantitative methods by distributing questionnaires to graduates of Chinese literature who work in the Chinese community. The results of the study of the ability of hard skills can be used to evaluate the curriculum of the Chinese Literature Study Program in Indonesia. Through curriculum evaluation, it is expected that the organizers of the Chinese Literature Study Program in Indonesia will be able to offer the courses needed to improve the competence of Chinese Literature graduates.

We argue that the concept of strategy has shifted from the competitive strategy into co-creation strategy based on collaboration value. In developing co-creation strategy, the input is derived from external factors associated with customer experience and internal factors related to distinctive capabilities and both focus on core competence development in supply chain management. We use telecommunication firms as our unit analysis with sample of 35 Indonesian Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) firms analysed using Partial Least Square (PLS). The findings show that the developing of co-creation strategy was supported by distinctive capabilities and customer experience. The findings also indicate that co-creation strategy emerges as a key in sustaining business of the firms to focus on developing customer experience and providing distinctive capabilities. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Co-creation strategy; Customer experience; Distinctive capabilities; Supply chain",,,,,,,,"Bolton, R.N., (2016) Service Excellence: Creating Customer Experiences that Build Relationships.

Digital technology has become an enabler in the innovation of business models. New capabilities are required to be developed, especially for incumbent firms, since new entries have more agility in establishing new business models to create value. Even though the incumbent firms have strong reputation, they need to develop new distinct capabilities to create value in the long run. The fastest way to develop new capabilities is through collaboration also known as co-creation. Co-creation is a form of economic strategy to bring mutual values from different parties as a mediating role in creating business model innovations. Since there are limited study on co-creation strategy in relation to corporate reputation and business model innovation, this paper aims to assess the mediating role of co-creation strategy on the relationship between business model innovation and corporate reputation. The unit of analysis is taken from Indonesian telecommunication firms with sample of 35 firms out of 445 firms using purposive sampling method. Smart PLS (Partial Least Square) is used as the analytical approach and solution in the study. Research results reveal that corporate reputation has an indirect effect on business model innovation, but a direct effect on co-creation strategy. Co-creation strategy also plays significant effect to business model innovation. Co-creation strategy is a moderator variable between business model innovation and corporate reputation.

There many APIs and algorithms out there that can recognize human faces. These APIs or algorithms is called Artificial Intelligence or AI. As modern civilian life in modern society, AI has been used so many times and developed into something more. This time, we proposed an idea to recognize motions and emotions on human faces to detect their stress levels. Companies nowadays need to have something that can know how their employees are feeling or think about their work. This program works by taking an image input from mounted cameras on the office's monitor. However, before that, the program must have been trained first to recognize faces and emotions. For this, the eigenfaces algorithm is used. After the input is received, then the program will process the image received and extract the features from the images such as eyes, nose, mouth, etc. to detect if there are faces and also the emotions of the face. After that, the features extracted will be matched with the features in the database to give an output of the percentage of stress. © 2019 IEEE.","artificial neural network; eigenfaces; employee stress recognition; face stress recognition","Artificial intelligence; Engineering education; Personnel; Technology transfer; Corporate employees; Eigenfaces; Facial recognition; Human faces; Image inputs; Stress levels; Face recognition",,,,,,,"Delac, K., Grgic, M., Bartlett, M.S., (2008) Recent Advances in Face Recognition, , (1st ed.).

Many people are clueless regarding what to do when an earthquake occurs. An earthquake has caused a more devastating outcome due to it being able to lead to other hazards. The idea of developing a mobile application surfaced by reading and receiving inspiration from the previous research. Previous research has been implementing different kinds of ways to alert people regarding the upcoming earthquake. The development of a mobile application to provide a platform that will assist people with information on what to do in times of before, during, and after the earthquake. Therefore, people will have a source that they can turn to when seeking information about the steps to be done when an earthquake occurs. Besides, providing information apropos to earthquakes, the mobile application will send further alerts to the people that are in that specific area. Moreover, people will be able to be aware of the particular areas that they are in. The alerts sent will give information to the people so that they could evacuate to safety as soon as possible before the upcoming earthquake occurs. © 2019 IEEE.","a mobile application for mitigation; Earthquake disaster mobile application; natural disaster mitigation","Disasters; Engineering education; Mobile computing; Indonesia; Mobile application development; Mobile applications; Natural disasters; Specific areas; Earthquakes",,,,,,,"Zambrano, A.M., Perez, I., Palau, C., Esteve, M., Technologies of internet of things applied to an earthquake early warning system (2017) Future Generation Computer Systems, 75, pp. 206-215; Pascapurnama, D.N., Murakami, A., Chagan-Yasutan, H., Hattori, T., Sasaki, H., Egawa, S., Integrated health education in disaster risk reduction: Lesson learned from disease outbreak following natural disasters in Indonesia (2018) International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, (29), pp. 94-102; Graham, F., (2013) Predicting Earthquakes and Saving Lives -with a Smartphone, , https://www.bbc.com, bbc.com, July. 9, [Online]., [Accessed: Sept. 25, 2018]; Kaur, H., Singh Sawhney, R., Komal, N., Wireless sensor networks for disaster management (2012) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Engineering & Technology, 1 (5); (2017) Looking Back at 2017: Natural Disasters in Indonesia, , https://www.Indonesia-investments.com/, Indonesia Investments, Indonesia Investments, Dec. 29, [Online]; (2018) Natural Disasters in Indonesia, , https://www.Indonesia-investments.com/, Indonesia Investments, Indonesia Investments, Sept. 3, [Online]; Wachter, J., Babeyko, A., Fleischer, J., Haner, R., Hammitzsch, M., Kloth, A., Lendholt, M., Development of tsunami early warning systems and future challenges (2012) Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, 12 (1923-1935). , June; Goda, K., Petrone, C., De Risi, R., Rossetto, T., Stochastic coupled simulation of strong motion and tsunami for the 2011 tohoku, Japan earthquake (2017) Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assesment, 31 (9), pp. 2337-2355; Goda, K., De Risi, R., Multi-hazard loss estimation for shaking and tsunami using stochastic rupture sources (2018) Internation Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 28, pp. 539-554; Okada, K., Nakamura, Y., Saruta, M., Application of earthquake early warning system to seismic-isolated buildings (2009) Journal of Disaster Research, 4 (4); Greco, L., Ritrovato, P., Tiropanis, T., Xhafa, F., (2018) IoT and Semantic Web Technologies for Event-detection in Natural Disasters, , [Online]; Erdelj, M., Natalizio, E., Uav-Assisted disaster management: Applications and open issue (2016) International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC 2016), pp. 1-5. , Feb 2016, Kauai, United States; Cheng, M.H., Beck, J.L., Earthquake early warning application to buildings (2014) Engineering Structure, 60, pp. 155-164; Yu, M., Yang, C., Li, Y., Big data in natural disaster management: A review (2018) Geosciences, 18 (165). , May, [online].

The way organizations manage resources and capability, especially in relationship with people, culture and process in creating new business models have changed. Previous studies on developing innovation based on customer experience and agility of organization focus on the concept, relationship among variables and the implication. However, in the context of industry 5.0, the study on those topics has not been revealing. Hence, this study aims to assess the concept of experience-agility innovation model to support transformation in the context of digital transformation to face Industry 5.0. The proposed model was assessed with 195 Indonesia ICT firms using SEM-PLS statistical tools. The findings demonstrate that the firm that offers compelling value proposition from customer experience while concurrently developing agility in the organization to create business model innovation could boost the transformational performance.

Sustainable values through co-creation involve crucial stakeholders, especially customers, organizations, and social communities to maximise the captured total value. Past studies have explored the concept, system and role of those stakeholders, however the sustainability of co-creation in the digital era has not been covered. Therefore, this paper aims to provide an understanding of the key concepts and models that would support practitioners in building sustainable innovation-driven digital co-creation. The study was conducted using 195 samples representing Indonesian ICT firms. Findings demonstrate that digital co-creation plays a significant role as an intervening variable in the relationship between customer experience orientation, social community, and organization agility and transformational performance. ©BEIESP.","Customer experience orientation; Digital co-creation; Organizational agility; Social community; Sustainability",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, MHE&SR

The platform service becomes critical in order to collaborate and innovate based on organizational agility and customer experience. Co-creation-driven innovation is considered as part of the service dominant development, where a dynamic organization model and customer experience feedback are required in the shaping of business model innovations within the digital ecosystem. The study was performed with a sample size of 175 respondents representing Indonesian telecommunication firms. Smart PLS was used as the statistical tool for analyses. Findings demonstrate that customer experience orientation and organizational agility has a direct impact on digital co-creation and business model innovation. Simultaneous testing of hypotheses shows that customer experience orientation has an indirect influence on business model innovation through co-creation strategy. However, organizational agility does not have any indirect impacts.

Whereas the extant literature has focused on technological development to reduce environmental damage, it has not analyzed profoundly how manufacturing processes can be greened effectively. Hence, using carefully gathered data of 299 respondents and structural equation modeling, this paper sought to investigate the mediating effect of social, environmental, and technical subsystems on the relationship between management support and sustainable manufacturing performance. The results show that management support has a positive relationship with sustainable manufacturing performance (p < 0.005), while social, environmental, and technical subsystems partially mediate this relationship. Hence, efforts must be taken to encourage management of manufacturing firms to support sustainable management performance, while at the same time supporting them to introduce innovative social, environmental, and technical practices. © 2019 by the authors.","Environment; Management support; Socio-technical systems; Technical work practices","innovation; manufacturing; performance assessment; questionnaire survey; sustainability; technological development",,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: FRGS/1/2017/SS08/UM/01/1","Author Contributions: M.I.Q. prepared the original manuscript, R.A/l.R. reviewed and revised the original manuscript also leading the project.

Hence, this paper examines the roles of digital leadership in developing strategic alliance and dynamic capability based on the market orientation. It is put forward that digital leadership behaviors have a stronger influence on the development of strategic alliance in order to drive dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. A quantitative method was used, comprising 88 senior leaders of Indonesian telecommunication companies. Purposive sampling method was used with the Smart PLS statistical tool. The findings confirm the direct and indirect significant effects between digital leadership and the development of strategic alliance and dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. The study has practical implications to take priority in developing digital leadership to enforce the transformation. The limitations of the study are identified to be the sample, time and statistical tool used, hence longitudinal study is suggested in the future with a more extended sample quantity and time frame. © 2019, Czestochowa University of Technology.

The study evaluated United Nation’s SDGs for environmental conservation and emission reduction in the panel of 35 selected SSA countries, during a period of 1995–2016. The study further analyzed the variable’s relationship in inter-temporal forecasting framework for the next 10 years’ time period, i.e., 2017–2026. The parameter estimates for the two models, i.e., CO2 model and PM2.5 models are analyzed by Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) estimator that handle possible endogeneity issue from the given models. The results rejected the inverted U-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) for CO2 emissions, while it supported for PM2.5 emissions with a turning point of US$5540 GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$. The results supported the “pollution haven hypothesis” for CO2 emissions, while this hypothesis is not verified for PM2.5 emissions. The major detrimental factors are technologies, FDI inflows, and food deficit that largely increase carbon emissions in a panel of SSA countries. The IPAT hypothesis is not verified in both the emissions; however, population density will largely influenced CO2 emissions in the next 10 years’ time period. The PM2.5 emissions will largely be influenced by high per capita income, followed by trade openness, and technologies, over a time horizon. Thus, the United Nation’s sustainable development agenda is highly influenced by socio-economic and environmental factors that need sound action plans by their member countries to coordinate and collaborate with each other and work for Africa’s green growth agenda. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Clean technologies;

However, currently, there is lack of studies to understand the role of digital technology and entrepreneur orientation on influencing the performance of SME’s in Indonesia. This study aims to develop a conceptual model linking entrepreneurial orientation, digital technology capability and SME performance. This study is using Systematic literature review (SLR) method. The result of SLR was used as the based for the concept development. More than 1100 publication published from 2010 to 2019 were screened with entrepreneurial orientation, digital technology and SMEs’ performance as keywords. Finally, 34 journals were included for this review. Based on the review there were three possible relationships in the conceptual model which are (1) there is a positive relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and firm performance; (2) there is a positive relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and digital technology capability and (3) there is a positive relationship between digital technology capability and firm performance. It concludes with the need for further study to find empirical validation of the three relationships. Contribution of this study is giving the conceptual framework that both entrepreneurial orientation and digital technology capability might have important roles to SMEs’ performance in Indonesia. © 2019, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication.

It is almost similar with combustion technology, however, without involving oxygen in the combustion process. In addition to renewable resources, the pyrolysis products are substances that are environmentally friendly and have many benefits. The pyrolysis products are such as tar, char and gas. Fuel source of the pyrolysis is derived from renewable resources such as biomass or plant. A macroalgae gracilaria is one of biomass can be used as raw material in the pyrolysis process. It is due to Indonesia has vast waters that have a wide range of aquatic products, so it is appropriate if the macroalgae is used to be a biomass feedstock of pyrolysis. In addition, the ability of macroalgae to breed is very high, so that it makes the macroalgae feedstock will be abundant. The macroalgae chemical composition consists mainly of crude fiber (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) of 32.15% hemicellulose, 17.04% cellulose, and 3.05% lignin. The aim of study was to investigate the thermal decomposition of macroalgae expected to produce some substances that can be used as an alternative fuel. In the experiment, the macroalgae samples were dried to reduce the moisture content. Afterwards, it was weighed 400 grams and put in a pyrolizer. The sample was pyrolyzed with variations in temperature of 250°C to 800°C for 3 hours. The results showed that the higher pyrolysis temperature, the less mass and volume char products, and the smaller the char heating values that differ from another biomass research. Meanwhile, an increasing of pyrolysis temperature also causes an increasing of mass and volume tar. The heating values of tar also incline. For the generated gas production, an increasing pyrolysis temperature result an enhancement of gas flow rate. © 2019 Author(s).",,,,,,,,,"Broido, A., Kinetics of Solid - Phase Cellulose Pyrolysis (1976) Thermal User and Properties of Carbohydrates and Lignin, pp. 19-35; Chaiwong, K., Kiatsirioat, T., Vorayos, N., Thararax, C., (2012) Journal of Science and Technology., 6 (2), pp. 186-195; Kim, G.S., Myung, K.S., Kim, Y.J., Oh, K.K., Ryu, H.J., Kim, K.H., Method of Producing using Sea Algae (2007) Word Interval Property Organization; Miura, M., Biomass Handbook (2002) Japan Institute of Energy, pp. 106-115; Orth, A.B., Rosye, D.J., Tien, M., (1993) Applied and Environmental Micrabiology.

Universities in Indonesia are required to be able to face and adjust to the changes that occurred in the industrial revolution era 4.0. Many universities think that moving lecture material into online or using high-specification computers means that they have taken part in implementing technology-based learning. The lecturer is the most important person who must respond to the changing times. Lecturers are the front guard in education at the university level. In addition to being important to produce quality graduates according to the needs of the times, self-quality renewal is also important for the sustainability of the lecturers' careers. Research conducted on the performance of industrial revolution-based 4.0 lecturers was used as the theme in this study because researchers assumed that lecturers had an important role in the industrial revolution era 4.0 for that the performance of lecturers needed improved in order to produce quality student graduates in accordance with the industrial revolution era 4.0. The performance of lecturers at this time is still a lot that has not been maximized in supporting the industrial revolution 4.0, this situation is possible because many factors influence it. In this paper will discuss conceptually the performance of lecturers based on industrial revolution 4.0. © BEIESP.","Industrial revolution 4.0; Lecturer; Performance; Universities",,,,,,,,"Bo, X., Marwala, T., (2017) Implications of the Fourth Industrial Age on Higher Education, , https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315682580; Fatimah, S., (2018), https://news.okezone.com/read/2018/03/28/65/1879369/era-digital-dosen-harus-mampu-beradaptasi-dengan-teknologi; Harususilo, Y.E., (2018), https://edukasi.kompas.com/read/2018/07/20/17005141/blunder-paradigma-menghadapi-era-industri-40; Nasir, M., (2018) Kebijakan Nasional Pendidikan Tinggi Indonesia Menghadapi Revolusi, , Industri 4.0.

In this study we conducted an analysis using the Neural Network approach to determine the performance of each dimension obtained from the ITEI database. Root Mean Square Errors values generated when using variables in dimensions related to Nationality Character are quite low, which is 0.151, with a correlation of 0.906 and execution time of 13s. In addition, the Nationality Character Dimension obtained excellent performance predictions when combined with the Positive Education Dimension. The Square Errors Root Mean value can be reduced to 0.102 with 8s execution time. The results of this analysis will be used as the basis for developing ITEI applications in the future so that the resulting Teacher Profiling can be used as a basis for policies and strategies to improve teacher performance and engagement in the school environment. © 2019 The Authors.

Learning agility does not accommodate the technological aspect in predicting the individual potential. This study proposes learning dexterity which accommodates technological and psycho-social aspects. The concept of learning dexterity has been empirically tested on 477 managerial resources of the Indonesian palm oil industry. The results concluded that learning dexterity in the second-order construct was a good construct for measuring individual potential. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

The collaboration, service orientation, agility and customer experience become a critical in this dynamic environment. Hence, the firm strategy has shifted from a competition strategy to a col-laboration strategy. Collaboration with customers is effected through co-creation Strategy (CCS). It could enable the firms in accelerating digital transformation. This study of the development of co-creation strategy focuses on customer experience orientation (CXO) and organization agility (OA) to support transformational performance (TP) in terms of relationship among variables and an empirical study has been conducted. Hence, in this paper, we propose a model of digital transformation for ICT Industry based on co-creation of strategy focused on customer experience orientation and organization agility. The study is based on an empirical study of 195 Indonesian ICT firms. The findings from this analysis reveal the concept of Service Dominant logic (S-D Logic) where the Co-creation capability and organizational agilities can suffice. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Co creation strategy; Customer experience orientation; Organization agility; Transformational performance",,,,,,,,"Bello, H.Y., Jikan-Jatum, A.M., Inuwa, N., An Appraisal of Socio-Economic Impacts of Commercial Motorcyles in Gombe State, Nigeria (2017) International Journal of Asian Social Science, 7 (6), pp. 480-488; Bessie, S., Beyene, F., Hundie, B., Goshu, D., Mulatu, Y., Land use/land cover change and its effects on bamboo forest in benishangul gumuz region, Ethiopia (2016) International Journal of Sustainable Development & World Policy, 5 (1), pp. 1-11; Chakravarty, A., Grewal, R., Sambamurthy, V., Information technology competencies, organizational agility, and firm performance (2013) Information Systems Research, 24 (4), pp. 976-997; Dean, A.M., Griffin, M., Kulczynski, A., Applying Service Logic to Education: The Co-creation Experience and Value Outcomes (2016) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 224, pp. 325-331. , August 2015; Fatma, S., Antecedents and Consequences of Customer Experience Management-A Literature Review and Research Agenda (2014) International Journal of Business and Commerce, 3 (6), pp. 32-49; Frow, P., Nenonen, S., Payne, A., Storbacka, K., Managing Co-creation Design: A Strategic Approach to Innovation (2015) British Journal of Management, 26 (3), pp. 463-483; Hamidi, F., Shams Gharneh, N., Impact of co-creation on innovation capability and firm performance: a structural equation modeling (2017) AD-Minister, pp. 73-90. , (june); Hemel, C., Rademakers, M.F., Building Customer-centric Organizations: Shaping Factors and Barriers (2016) Journal of Creating Value, 2 (2), pp. 211-230; Loss, L., Crave, S., Agile Business Models: an Approach to support collaborative networks (2011) Production Planning & Control, 22 (5-6), pp. 571-580; Lusch, R.F., Vanco, L., Service-Dominant Logic What It Is, What It Is Not, What It Might Be (2006) In The service dominant logic of marketing: Dialog, debate and directions, pp. 43-56; Mihardjo, L.W.W., Alamsjah, F., Elidjen, E., Sasmoko, S., Digital Transformation in the Age of Industry 4 (2018) 0: Acceleration of Transformational Performance through Business Model Innovation and Co-Creation Strategy in Indonesian ICT Firms Transformación digital en la era de la industria 4. 0: Aceleración del.

Self-diagnostics of teaching can range from personal reflection to formal assessment intended for specific purposes. This paper proposes a novel application of self-diagnostics using fuzzy logic for teaching-learning quality improvement for lecturers, so lecturers recognize the weaknesses and advantages of teaching ability. We use 6 variables as input that consists of openness, clear and understandably, enthusiastic, teaching methods, feedback and commitment for evaluating his performance. The results show that our proposed method is able to evaluate the level of quality of teaching-learning with some suggestions for improvement of the lecturers. Based on the evaluation of exam and quiz after lecturer improves his/her capability in teaching, there is improvement of score 20% for exam and 30% for quiz compared with previous evaluation. © 2019, ICIC International.

Hence, the purpose of this paper is to examine what are the roles of digital leadership in developing strategic alliance and dynamic capability based on market orientation. We argue that digital leadership behaviors have a stronger influence on the development of strategic alliance to drive dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. A quantitative method is used comprising 88 senior leaders of Indonesian telecommunication. The purposive sampling methods is used with the statistical tool is Smart PLS. The findings confirm the significant influence directly and indirectly between digital leadership and the development of strategic alliance and dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. The study has practical implication to take the priority in developing of digital leadership in enforcing the transformation. the limitations of study could be identified as the sample, time and used statistical tools, hence the further study can be extended in term of sample quantity, time horizon to become longitudinal research. © 2019, Dorma Journals.

In doing so, the authors seek to examine the technological antecedents of customer experience (CUE) by examining the role of green information systems (GIS) and service innovation (SEI). Moreover, the study also aims to investigate the association of SEI and GIS with customer satisfaction (CUS) and hotels environmental performance (ENP). The novelty of the present study lies in identifying and testing the joint effects of the studied variables in improving the understanding of CUS and ENP in an existing complex environment. The results of PLS-SEM confirm that customer experience and ENP have a positive and significantly influenced by the GIS. Moreover, the results further suggested that customer experience and CUS have significantly and positively impacted by SEI. Finally, the results of PLS-SEM confirm that ENP and CUS have significantly and positively impacted by customer experience in multinational firms in Indonesia. © 2019, Econjournals.

The Indonesian market is unique in terms of its ICT infrastructure, but still left behind compared to other countries. However, the market has tremendous opportunities in terms of digital capability innovations. The strategic management outline used as a framework for this paper. Mediating variables were co-creation strategies and business innovations with distinctive organisational capability as an internal factor and consumer orientation as the external independent factor. The construct of co-creation strategy and transformational performance were discussed. This model of digital transformation was a suitable model for senior leaders to transform digital business capability and academics. Moreover, the model and construct of variable can be used to further develop the theory of digital transformation.

In addition to that moderating role of mutual trust is also examined. The study has broached the argument that knowledge sharing and transformational leadership style improves team performance.

The currents study is also of the view that the that the process of creativity starts in the situation when the team members share knowledge through coordination and it is also argued that the much of the knowledge is shared when team members meet to share knowledge in a given area, much of which is tacit. Sharing such tacit knowledge creates a flow of novel ideas that contribute to successful outcomes, such as new products, processes and patents. The findings of the study have shown agreement with the proposed or hypothesize results. The study has used PLS-SEM to analyses the data. The study will be helpful for policy makers in the researcher in understanding the issues related to supply chain, its integration, flexibility, and internal performance. © 2019, General Jonas Zemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania.","knowledge sharing; Leadership; Transformational",,,,,,,,"Avolio, B.J., Bass, B.M., Individual consideration viewed at multiple levels of analysis: A multi-level framework for examining the diffusion of transformational leadership (1995) The Leadership Quarterly, 6 (2), pp. 199-218. , https://doi.org/10.1016/1048-9843(95)90035-7; Basheer, M., Siam, M., Awn, A., Hassan, S., Exploring the role of TQM and supply chain practices for firm supply performance in the presence of information technology capabilities and supply chain technology adoption: A case of textile firms in Pakistan (2019) Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 7 (2), pp. 275-288. , https://doi.org/10.5267/j.uscm.2018.9.001; Bock, G.W., Kim, Y.-G., Breaking the myths of rewards: An exploratory study of attitudes about knowledge sharing (2002) Information Resources Management Journal (IRMJ), 15 (2), pp. 14-21. , https://doi.org/10.4018/irmj.2002040102; Burke, C.S., Sims, D.E., Lazzara, E.H., Salas, E., Trust in leadership: A multi-level review and integration (2007) The Leadership Quarterly, 18 (6), pp. 606-632. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2007.09.006; Casimir, G., Lee, K., Loon, M., Knowledge sharing: influences of trust, commitment and cost (2012) Journal of Knowledge Management, 16 (5), pp. 740-753. , https://doi.org/10.1108/13673271211262781; Cerneviciute, J., Strazdas, R., Teamwork management in Creative industries: factors influencing productivity (2018) Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Issues, 6 (2), pp. 503-516. , http://doi.org/10.9770/jesi.2018.6.2(3); Cheng, W., Hailin, L., Hongming, X., Does knowledge sharing mediate the relationship between trust and firm performance?

The digital transformation is required by incumbent to develop innovation on product and service business model based on customer experience orientation. To support this transformation, strong digital leader is important to assure the development of this transformation. The study on the role of digital leadership on business model innovation and customer experience has not been explored, significantly, Hence, this research aims at assessing the role of digital leadership, whether it directly or indirectly influences the customer experience orientation in developing business model innovation. This study was conducted through survey to 88 senior leader respondents from Indonesia telecommunication firms, in which Smart-PLS application was used to analyze the data. The result show that digital leadership had direct and indirect impacts on customer experience orientation in developing business model innovation. The practical implications of these findings are recommended for the senior leader of management of telecommunications industries in Indonesia to strengthen digital leadership capability in conjunction with the development of business model innovation and customer experience orientation. Further research can be explored by expanding the sample, industry, statistical application and longitudinal study. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

The capabilities can be fostered when the leader is oriented towards digital technology and market orientation. The role of digital leadership has gained attention for studies to develop innovation and dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. Studies have been conducted on dynamic capabilities with focus on the strategy, management and economic literature including the understanding of its driving key to success. However, the study on the role of digital leadership on the development of dynamic capability based on innovation capability and market orientation has not been intensively discussed. It is argued that the development of dynamic capability and innovation capability is strongly driven from a combination of digital leadership and market orientation. Data in this study is taken from a survey conducted on 88 Indonesian telecommunication firms as a unit for analyses. The results show that digital leadership had a strong direct and indirect relationship with dynamic capability, however the strong path in developing capability is determined from the development of innovation capability that is driven from digital leadership based on market orientation. The finding reinforces the role of digital leadership as a critical influence on development of dynamic capability. Future studies are suggested to extend the research by exploring the research model to elaborate more on the impact of collaboration, leveraging a larger sample size and better statistical tools. A longitudinal study on the companies that implement the transformation based on dynamic capabilities is also recommended for future studies. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

Digital leadership will significantly enable sensing market changes, seizing opportunities, and reconfiguring organizations. Previous studies on digital leadership, dynamic capability, and innovation management focus mainly on constructs, benefits, and implications. However, a study on the role of digital leadership based on dynamic capability in fostering innovation and the impact of market orientation have not been thoroughly explored, which is the aim of this study, taking market orientation as a moderating variable. Employing a quantitative methodology, data were collected through online questionnaires, distributed through email and messaging applications to a purposive sample of 88 senior managers of Indonesian telecommunication firms. The results reveal that digital leadership based on dynamic capability impacts directly and indirectly on developing innovation. Market orientation also plays an important role in accelerating innovation. Due to limitations in terms of research model, sample size, and time, further research using larger samples in other industries and countries should be undertaken. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Digital leadership; Dynamic capability; Innovation management; Market orientation; Transformation model",,,,,,,,"Abiodun, B.Y., The Prospects of Accounting and Economic Systems in the Era of Global Knowledge Economy (2014) The Economics and Finance Letters, 1 (2), pp. 9-14; Ahmed, A., Rehan, R., Chhapra, I.U., Supro, S., Interest Rate and Financial Performance of Banks in Pakistan (2018) International Journal of Applied Economics, Finance and Accounting, 2 (1), pp. 1-7; Ali, A., Haseeb, M., Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology as a strategic tool towards higher performance of supply chain operations in textile and apparel industry of Malaysia (2019) Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 7 (2), pp. 215-226; Amfo, P., Cudjoe, G., Acheampong, G., Adams, M., Boakye, E., Market Orientation, Innovation and Business Performance: Insight from Womenpreneurs in the Fashion Industry in Ghana Market Orientation (2018) Journal of Creativity and Business Innovation, 4. , April; Arief, M., Basuki, Y.T., Dynamic capability as a business strategy enhancing the business performance (A conceptual approach) (2015) Advanced Science Letters, 21 (4), pp. 690-694; Basuki, Y.T., Arief, M., Propheto, A., The role of leadership, dynamic capabilities, and organization culture, in company performance of manufacturing industries in Indonesia (Study in food and beverages industries) (2015) Advanced Science Letters, 21 (5), pp. 1141-1145; Berman, S.J., Marshall, A., The next digital transformation: From an individual-centered to an everyone-to-everyone economy (2014) Strategy and Leadership, 42 (5), pp. 9-17; Bessant, J., Phillips, W., Innovation management and dynamic capability (2013) The Sage Handbook of Strategic Supply Manage-Ment: Relationships, Chains, Networks and Sectors, , http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/12488%5Cnhttp://www.sagepub.com/books/Book229482, Retrieved from; Breznik, L., Hisrich, R.D., Dynamic capabilities vs. Innovation capability: Are they related?

Methods: This secondary research collected data from macroeconomic and AI-specific data sets. The sources of data from which insights were gained included digital technology sectors and corporations and their functions. The focus was on the need to assess the capability of AI on business operations The macroeconomic data was collected from data resources of international organizations’ including the World Economic Forum, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). In addition, this study has considered 19 economic indicators to analyze the economic outcome of AI in selected economies of Asia-Pacific. Results: From the results, the period between 2014 and 2016 witnessed China leading with over 25,000 citable documents on the AI topic. Regarding institutions that were observed to publish over 500 times on the AI topic, the countries in the ascending order include China (600), Hong Kong (1,100), and Singapore (2,000). As such, this study established that Asia-Pacific economies such as Hong Kong and Singapore though have smaller populations, but the majority of their higher education institutions have made a significant contribution to AI research; with the small economies also having a relatively higher number of computer scientists among the top 1,000 individuals. Additionally, through empirically analyses, during 1998–2016 with annual observations, it is found that various economic outcomes of AI were presented in 8 economies of targeted region. Limitations: At first, the future outlook of AI is just discussed in conceptual meaning while empirical context still needs to be examined in upcoming studies. At second, covering the overall South Asian region provides better findings with more generalization which is missing in current research. At third, other dimensions of AI and economy like implication of AI impact index and its relationship with macroeconomic variables is also missing in current research which could be reconsidered in coming studies. Conclusion: It is evident that AI exhibits the potential to be the main driver of Asia-Pacific’s economic growth. Relative to the net and gross effect of AI on labor markets and the gross domestic product (GDP) of the top Asia-Pacific economies demonstrate that by 2030, AI might yield a 16-percent increase in output, translating into an estimated amount of $13 trillion. Overall, it is concluded that Asia-Pacific, when compared to developed regions such as North America, is lagging but the availability of a large pool of user data implies that the region can move ahead—given better resource and talent allocation. © 2019 The Authors.

The results confirm that natural disasters in the form of storm and flood largely increase migration, price level, and poverty incidence, which negatively influenced country’s economic resources, including enlarge healthcare expenditures, high energy demand, and low economic growth. The study further presented the following results: i) natural resource depletion increases external migration, ii) FDI inflows increase price level, iii) increase healthcare spending and energy demand decreases poverty headcount, iv) poverty incidence and mortality rate negatively influenced healthcare expenditures, v) industrialization increases energy demand, and vi) agriculture value added, fertilizer, and cereal yields required more water supply to produce greater yield. The study emphasized the need to magnify the intensity of natural disasters and create natural disaster mitigation unit to access the human and infrastructure cost and attempt quick recovery for global prosperity. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Asian countries; Economic losses; Energy demand; Environmental resources; Health expenditures; Migration; Natural disasters; Poverty","agriculture; Asia; economic development; economics; environmental protection; migration; natural disaster; poverty; supply and distribution; trends; water supply; Agriculture; Asia; Conservation of Natural Resources; Economic Development; Human Migration; Natural Disasters; Poverty; Water Resources; Water Supply",,,,,,,"Abbott, P.L., (2004) Natural disaster, , McGraw Hill.

Digital transformations are required by Telecommunication firms to transform their portfolio beyond the pipeline to close the gap in business model innovations, redefine customer engagement and co-creation, and set up new distinctive organization capabilities. This paper has the objective to develop a digital transformation model by assessing the mediating role of co-creation strategy on the relationship between distinctive organizational capability and business model innovation. The units of analysis are Indonesian telecommunication firms, using a sample of 35 out of 445 telecommunication firms. The analytical approach used for analysis is Smart Partial Least Square (PLS). The study results reveal that distinctive organizational capability has an indirect effect on business model innovation, but direct effect to co-creation strategy. © 2018, Czestochowa University of Technology.

In current modern society, information technology exists as a multidisciplinary tool to solve lingering problems that could not be solved by traditional efforts. This paper aims to provide knowledge regarding identified efforts to fight corruption specifically in Indonesia region. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology is used as the methodology, and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow is used as framework to identify relevant records. Scopus database is used as data source. A total of 10 records are labelled as relevant to this research, and the findings are synthesized. It was found from the records that the main areas of interest for ICT research for corruption prevention in Indonesia are (1) information transparency, (2) operational enhancement, (3) success evaluation, (4) security and fraud, and (4) decision support. The findings are expected to assist future research in term of providing valuable insights on corruption prevention using ICT in Indonesia. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The study also addresses the United Nations sustainable development agenda under a resource conservation framework across countries. A two-step differenced Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator is employed for robust inferences. The results show that bank-specific factors substantially reduce resource depletion, whereas international tourism increases energy resource depletion and carbon emissions across countries. Nuclear energy consumption reduces resource depletion, whereas industrial value added increases resource depletion and carbon emissions; thus, it is imperative to devise strong policies for sustainable production across countries. The results of panel causality tests confirm different causality patterns among the studied variables. The study concludes that an environmental and resource conservation process needs sustainable policy instruments, including cleaner production techniques, renewable energy sources, and sustainable production and consumption to achieve green growth. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","dynamic panel GMM; financial factors; net tourism receipts; Nuclear energy consumption; panel causality; resource depletion","Carbon; Conservation; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Industrial emissions; Method of moments; Nuclear energy; Pollution control; Renewable energy resources; Dynamic panels; Financial factors; net tourism receipts; Panel causality; Resource depletion; Sustainable development",,,,"Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University","The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University for funding this work through research group no.

In addition, in the E-Learning learning system we must also provide accurate and accurate information. The research method used is literature study and analysis. Literature study was carried out on the face of face detection and recognition in real-Time conditions carried out by various previous studies. Furthermore, analysis was carried out in a literature study studio to find suitable methods for the E-Learning environment. From the results of existing literature studies we recommend face detection using Face Countour and the Adaboost Algorithm added to CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)to normalize the facial contour function and normalize lightning in the surrounding environment where a face detection is located. The process is carried out, we use the 3WPCA-MD(Three-Level Wavelet Decomposition Principal Component Analysis with Mahalonobis Distance) method which is able to produce calculations, that is, face recognition that is faster when compared to ordinary PCA (Principal Component Analysis) methods.

To imagine the severances of it, 10.000 KM of highway can be built with that much amount of fund. Several responses has been done by Indonesian government to fight corruption from both prevention and persecution. This work focuses on the development of a web application aimed to provide insight to corruption case per province in Indonesia. The web application was developed using Machine Learning, specifically Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Web crawling and web scraping techniques are used to gather news content from 7 major news portal in Indonesia. Accuracy is measured by comparing correct prediction by ANN to its true value. Upon finding corruption news, data is saved and further analysis is done to establish the number of corruption news per region. Finally, the output is visualized using Google Map API. The purpose of this work is to provide regional depiction of corruption case to give further insight to be used by decision makers. Upon using this web application, objectivity of program development is expected to increase. The final output of the web application is a map of corruption case in Indonesia per region.

Third, it is possible for a company to commit infringements to smooth out the PPP process and the likelihood of public officers as policy makers in facilitating and accommodating PPP agreements. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Compliance; Corrupt Acts; Detection; Governance; Public Private Partnership (PPP); Risk",,,,,,,,"Adewale, O.H., Internal control system: A managerial tool for proper accountability a case study of Nigeria customs (2014) European Scientific Journal, 10 (13), pp. 252-267; Akbar, Y.H., Vujić, V., Explaining corruption (2014) Cross Cultural Management, 21, pp. 191-218; Alexander, R., The role of whistleblower in the fight against economic crime (2005) Journal of Financial Crime, 12 (2), pp. 131-138; Badara, M., Saidin, S., Impact of the effective internal control system on the internal audit effectiveness at local government level (2013) Journal of Social and Development Sciences, 4 (1), pp. 16-23. , https://doi.org/10.5923/j.ijfa.20130202.05; Bastin, G., Townsend, P., Whistleblowers — A legitimate role in corporate life?

This study examines the impact of air transportation, railways transportation, and container port traffic on energy demand, customs duty, and economic growth in a panel of 40 heterogeneous countries, which comprises 16 low income & lower middle income (LI&LMI) countries and 24 upper middle & high income (UM&HI) countries for the period of 1990–2015. The study employed panel econometric techniques which account for cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity. The results show that air-railways transportation has a positive and significant relationship with the energy demand (ED) in aggregated panel, whereas air-railways passengers carried positively influenced ED in LI&LMI countries, and railways transported goods (RT) significantly increases ED in UM&HI countries. Air freight (AF) and railways passengers carried (RPC) escalate customs duty (CUD) in aggregated panel, while RPC positively influences CUD in LI&LMI countries, and AF significantly increases CUD in UM&HI countries. Container port traffic (CPT) positively influenced per capita income (GDPPC) across countries. The causality estimates confirmed the bidirectional relationship, unidirectional, reverse causality, and no causal relationships between the studied variables with different transportation modes. The estimates of impulse response function (IRF) suggest that transportation (except RPC) and growth factors will positively influence ED in aggregated panel while differential impacts of transportation and growth factors will affect CUD over a next 30 years time period. The variance decomposition analysis (VDA) shows that GDPPC will largely influence by ED and least influenced by CUD, while CPT will greatly affect by CUD and least influenced by AF, over a next 30 years period.

Level of national teachers' engagement needs to be a reference to the level of educational success and equity of national education. The spread of geographically inaccessible Indonesian teachers is a barrier to these measurements. ITEI Android application developed by analysing the geographical problem, so that each teacher can participate wherever they are. The ITEI app is designed by implementing Android on the client side and load balancer on the server side. Android ITEI will feature a number of questions questionnaire to teachers. Meanwhile, the load balancer will distribute the answers to each server for processing. Load Balancer ensures fast data processing and minimize server failure. The results of the processing on the server will be sent back to Android in the form of profiling themselves ITEI teachers. While the data obtained and stored in the server can be used to measure the level of national teachers' engagement. The result of this research is the design of ITEI application ready to be implemented in order to support the data collection process of teacher national engagement level. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Android (operating system); Data handling; Android applications; Client sides; Data collection process; Engagement levels; Indonesians; Load balancer; Server sides; Teachers'; Teaching",,,,"Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan

There are many new mobile applications with high user feedback but few download rates. Moreover, some users of the application are unwilling to give their feedbacks. This abrupt state is caused by the carelessness of mobile application developers in noticing the importance of user feedback and user behavior. In this paper, we will state several steps and options that could be taken by mobile application developers to popularize their mobile application. This solution is mainly focused on the utilization of user feedback and user behavior, which also include proper use of feedback loop, great advertising, and behavioral change. The objectives of this analysis are to change unpopular mobile applications with high user feedback to become popular mobile application with high user download rate, as well as to encourage users to properly express their opinion regarding the application by giving out their feedback to the mobile application developers. © 2017 IEEE.","Behavioral Change; Download Rate; Feedback Loop; Mobile Application; User Behavior; User Feedbacks","Artificial intelligence; Feedback; Internet of things; Mobile computing; Behavioral changes; Feed-back loop; Mobile applications; User behaviors; User feedback; Behavioral research",,,,,,,"Islam, R., Islam, R., Mazumder, T.A., Mobile application and its global impact (2010) International Journal of Engineering & Technology, 10 (6), pp. 72-78; (2015) Mobile Medical Application: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, , U.S. Department of Health Human Services Food and drug Administration, Rockville, MD, USA, February; Holzer, A., Ondrus, J., Mobile application market: A developer's perspective (2011) Telematics and Informatics, 28 (1), pp. 22-31; Adrian, D., Tarigan, R.E., The effect of revenue and market segmentation level towards venture capital investment in mobile application business (2014) International Journal of Communication & Information Technology (CommIT), 8 (1), pp. 10-16. , May; Cheng, J., Mizli, C.D.N., Leskovec, J., How community feedback shapes user behaviour (2014) Proceedings of the 8th International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, , 1-4 June; Hattie, J., Timperley, H., The power of feedback (2007) Review of Educational Research, 77 (1), pp. 81-112. , March; Renaud, K., Cooper, R., Feedback in human computer interaction-characteristic and reccomendation (2000) South African Journal, 2000 (26), pp. 105-114. , Nov; Brookhart, S.M., (2008) How to Give Effective Feedback to Your Student. 2nd Ed, , Virginia, USA, Association for Supervision and CurriculumDevelopment (ASCD); Storey, J., (2015) Cultural Theory and Popular Culture, 7th Ed, , New York, USA, Routledge; Astrom, K.J., Murray, R.M., (2008) Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers, , New Jersey, USA.

The respondents were 672 teachers of elementary, junior high, high school and vocational school. The number of items planned was 165 items with the initial reliability of 0.98. The ITEI scale uses Likert Scale (1 to 4) which was converted from ordinal scale to Equal Interval Scale. RASCH MODEL analysis was done by selecting based on Outfit Mean Square (MNSQ) between 0.5-1.5 as a good item, and measuring Point Measure Correlation (Pt Mean Corr) with the criterion of 0.4-0.85. Moderate Outfit Z-Standard (ZSTD) was ignored because the sample was >500.

The government has an important role in economic growth. However, there are still many civil servants who abuse their positions to do corruption. The central government should pay more attention to each region to avoid corruption cases. For developing a mapping system, Naïve Bayes classifier is needed to classify news about corruption and non-corruption. N-Gram and Hash Table were used to map corruption cases based on Indonesia’s administrative territory. The experimental results showed that Naïve Bayes classification achieved 100% accuracy for training and testing. However, N-Gram and Hash Table achieved 85% accuracy for mapping the location of the article. © 2018 ICIC International.","Corruption; Corruption perception index; Indonesia; System development",,,,,,,,"(2014), http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/indonesia/overview; (2017), http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/GDP.pdf; Noerlina, L.A.W., Sasmoko, A.M.M., Alamsyah, M., Corruption cases mapping based on Indonesia’s corruption perception index (2017) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 801 (1); (2017), http://www.corruptionwatch.org.za/learn-about-corruption/what-is-corruption/our-definition-of-corruption; Siddique, M., Ghosh, R., (2014) Corruption, Good Governance and Economic Development: Contemporary Analysis and Case Studies, , World Scientific Publishing, Singapore; (2009), https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/the_anti_corruption_plain_language_guide; Shah, A., Schacter, M., Combinating corruption: Look before you leap (2004) Finance Development, 4, pp. 40-43; Mauro, P., Why Worry about Corruption?

But it still raises some obstacles in the implementation, as it relates to equity and access. In another aspect, e-learning also contains major weaknesses, namely the decrease in the frequency of direct contact between learners and between students with lecturers and other learning resources, so that learning does not experience completeness in all aspects of cognitive and non-cognitive. The weakness is also accompanied by the suspicion of the institution to the honesty of learners in carrying out the learning process. This study aims at building an e-learning model that can bring the intensity and capacity of learners actually through the virtual world through self-assessment based on image processing. The proposed steps are break into several parts: create a dataset of faces that can be used to evaluate given algorithm. Subsequently the enhancement using histogram equalization allows a strong enhancement on facial features. In addition, then the feature descriptor are selected using Viola and Jones [1]. Afterwards, those features will be saved to database. The next step is to build the system than allows the online learners are detected through our image processing approach then all the interaction will be verified using our proposed infrastructure. The results of the study: (a) Image Processing Based E-Learning model was built with a system capable of running in existing infrastructure so far, and (b) Image Processing Based E-Learning model proved valid and reliable both substantially, system and feasibility significant. The results of this study have implications that can be tested on a larger scale that is for some courses and in a particular department. © 2017 IEEE.","E-Learning; Image Processing; Mastery Learning","E-learning; Education computing; Information management; Learning systems; Teaching; Virtual reality; E-learning models; Electronic information; Feature descriptors; Histogram equalizations; Learning process; Learning resource; Mastery learning; Strong enhancement; Image processing",,,,,,,"Viola, P., Jones, M., Rapid object detection using a boosted cascade of simple features (2001) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 1, pp. I511-I518; Lockee, B.B., Gros, B., (2017) Learning, Design, and Technology, pp. 1-23. , http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-17727-4, [Online]; Sahid, D.S.S., Santosa, P.I., Ferdiana, R., Lukito, E.N., Evaluation and measurement of Learning Management System based on user experience (2016) Engineering Seminar (InAES), International Annual, pp. 72-77; Tavangarian, D., Leypold, M.E., Nölting, K., Röser, M., Voigt, D., Is e-learning the solution for individual learning?

Community colleges and schools seek to complement the traditional teaching system with e-learning systems. However, we found there are differences in individual learning styles in terms of speed and learning styles. Serving or teaching students with one mechanism of the same teaching method will ignore individual rights while reducing the meaning of education broadly from the humanity dimension. Such situations will affect the target of increasing competence, the growth of knowledge and the value expected for some individuals to fail. The electronic learning model then undergoes a shift away from a mere system, now evolving into a personalized learning model, where learning processes are oriented toward the students' abilities. Under these conditions, models and other techniques are needed to help personalized adaptive learning as they need it. The purpose of this study was to identify the general criteria of personalized electronic learning model to meet the needs, interests and objectives of the learner in a more personal sense in a broader sense. This research was conducted through literature study on papers published in the last five years (2012-2017). The results show the common components, techniques or tools that are commonly used, as well as the support of the theoretical basis used as the platform for the development of a personalized e-learning model. © 2017 IEEE.","Architecture; Component; E-learning; Framework; Model; Personalized","Architecture; Developing countries; Education computing; Information management; Learning systems; Models; Teaching; Component; Framework; Information technology application; Personalized; Personalized e-learning; Personalized learning; Systematic literature review; Traditional teachings; E-learning",,,,,,,"Wan, S., Niu, Z., A learner oriented learning recommendation approach based on mixed concept mapping and immune algorithm (2016) Knowledge-Based Syst., 103, pp. 28-40; Laksitowening, K.A., Hasibuan, Z.A., Personalized e-learning architecture in standard-based education (2015) Proc.-2015 Int.

The concept of Jakarta socio-cultural ecology architecture is characterized by residential development capabilities that reflect and express the indigenous culture, the settlements built by linking the social and economic activities of the people of Jakarta and the settlements built by maintaining the building with the value of existing heritage. The objectives of this research are 1) to find a relevant construct to housing condition in Jakarta which then called Jakarta socio-cultural ecology, and 2) to see the tendency of complex condition of Jakarta socio-cultural ecology settlement. This research uses Neuroresearch method, which is one of mix-method research method as a mixture research method between qualitative research (exploration) and quantitative research method (explanatory and confirmatory). The population of research as well as unit analysis are all settlements in Jakarta. Sampling technique using probability sampling that is with multistage sampling. The results show that nowadays the Jakarta residential complex tends to lead to socio-cultural ecology and rather reflects and expresses the indigenous culture, the residential complex in Jakarta tends to form the building has been linked fully with the social and economic activities of Jakarta society but tends to occasionally maintain buildings with existing heritage values.

This is derived from national vision in sustainability development demanding a more transparent, reliable, and competent leadership. Regarding to this, distortions often occur due to governance malpractices in the form of corruption which impact officials' performance as well as environment conduciveness. This phenomenon is taken as a fundamental paradigm of this research which results in a reasoning stating that officials' objective evaluation. This research realizes that cannot be don e by considering officials as a single-role entity. It must consider several roles which impacts and influences several different parties (political, social, and governmental). This research comprehends such gap through comprehensive literature review and transforms all theories in the purpose of building a systematic assessment methodology which captures various aspects from different perspective. In its discussion, this model is proven academically to be able to evaluate officials' performance objectively through three broad parameters: (1 ) policies formulation, (2) social engagement, and (3) regulatory submission. In addition, those three categorical assessment would be integrated in a weightedaverage system, enabling them to produce a numerical score. In this stage, this framework is applied through information technology is used to capture data from different respondents. © 2018 Authors.","Corruption; Local administrative law; Officials' evaluation; Public policy; Social perception; State governance",,,,,,"This model is a philosophical framework built to support W.a.W (We are Watching) smart application's construct designed to com-pile society's perception in officials' assessment [23].

This paper has the objective to provide the antecedents of business model innovation and compare the effects of corporate reputation and distinctive organizational capability in developing business model innovation. The study is based on the digital disruption phenomenon, where established companies are disrupted by the new entries with the new business model that leverages digital capability. The study focuses on information, communication and technology (ICT) of the incumbent companies in developing business model innovations as the second curve in sustaining the business. The ICT industry is an important sector in the development of other industries and has a significant influence on economic growth, which currently relies on emerging markets such as Indonesia. The Indonesian ICT market has unique characteristics where innovation grows rapidly, but infrastructure lacks behind and the market is very competitive. This creates a gap between innovation opportunities and development of digital infrastructure. As for the incumbent firms, the mitigation of risks of the investment of ICT infrastructure and competition with new entries with their new business model and market. Incumbent firms still have the advantage of corporate reputation and are required to develop distinctive capability. However, the study of developing business model innovations for incumbent firms in the market with a focus on corporate reputation is still limited. The current study is an empirical study using a sample of 35 Indonesian ICT firms. Smart Partial Least Square (SmartPLS) is the analytical approach and solution technique used in the study. Research findings show that the distinctive organization capability has more influence compared to corporate reputation in developing business model innovations. The study implicates on the theory that the development of business model innovations should focus on distinctive organization capabilities rather than relying more heavily on corporate reputation. This means that ICT Incumbent firms are required to transform their capabilities to align with market changes. In terms of management, the study also implicates the urgency in developing distinctive organizational capabilities in respective units, especially in intangible assets. Further research can be explored by expanding the research sample and industry conducting longitudinal study on the transformational model of incumbent firms. © 2018, Universidad del Zulia.

One form is e-learning. In its development, e-learning has several problems when faced with the background and needs of students who take part in learning. These differences affect the effectiveness of learning because not all students have the same learning style. To over-come these problems, researchers tried to use fuzzy logic methods. Fuzzy logic is chosen to answer the uncertainty that occurs in learning subjective student characters. Therefore, the study was conducted on one e-learning website called sasmoko.com.

This paper aims to discuss how ICT firms could manage the transformational performance by integrating business model innovations and co-creation strategy. The construction model of transformational performance and co-creation strategy is expected to contribute to the theory of performance and co-creation reviewed in literatures based on the Indonesian ICT phenomenon. Indonesia’s ICT Industry has gained the attention to be studied since it is one of the emerging markets with unique market characteristics with numerous opportunities but lacking the digital infrastructure. The digital transformation is required for firms to be able to sustain their business. Measurement on the success of implementing the transformation is one of the key success factors. The construction of the transformational performance variable is driven from the theory of quality management, balance scorecards and digital maturity. The construct could contribute as a reference model to track the firms’ transformational performance. In digital transformation and disruptive era, business models and co-creation are key factors to drive performance. Co-creation is one of the business model innovations that is done through collaboration and partnerships. It is also an integrated strategy used in order to perform in the market. To elaborate the model, we develop a prototype using a sample of 35 senior leaders from Indonesian ICT firms. Partial Least Square (PLS) is the statistical tool used to analyze the data foo this study. The findings show that a firm’s transformational performance is significantly influenced by business model innovations and co-creation strategy. Further findings show that in digital transformation, a firm cannot fulfill all core capabilities as it requires collaboration and crowd sourcing. Our selected examples are only prototypes of the research model and implications of this study are limited to their particular context. Ultimately, our research model requires further research and validation, which should be done in future studies. © 2018, Universidad del Zulia.

In this order, the central government should pay attention to every area in the nation to avoid corruption case. Meanwhile, the news media always constantly preach about corruption case, this makes the news media relevant for being one of the sources of measurement of corruption perception index (CPI). It is required to map the corruption case in Indonesia so the central government can pay attention to every region in Indonesia.

One hundred and twenty five nursing students and one hundred and twelve assistant medical officer students (total of two hundred thirty seven respondents) participated in this descriptive, cross sectional quantitative study. Instruments employed were Ying's Formal Academic Stress Scale 2009, Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale, 1983 and Ways of Coping by Lazarus and Folkman, 1984. The result of the study reported the highest academic stress that students are facing is related to peers. Highest mean was reported by both groups of students for this construct. Second highest mean was related to tests. Data analyzed using descriptive and t test proved significance (p value of 0.05) of academic stress among respondents. Analysis of stress levels were performed. The result demonstrated that students are facing high stress levels. Eighty eight percent of nursing students had more than average and high stress levels. Eighty nine percent of assistant medical officer students demonstrated the same. Ways of coping contained 8 constructs and highest mean determined the most used. Majority of students stated accepting responsibility for ways of coping. This finding was similar for both nursing and assistant medical officer students. Demographic variables were tested and demonstrated no significance differences according to race, age and sex. This finding is contradictory with other findings whereby the male and the female have different ways of coping, whereby women demonstrate more emotional coping compared to males. High stress levels need to be addressed as these students have just stepped into college life and need assistance to cope.

Employees experience engaged condition when they have a leader with a supportive leadership style. The aim of the study is to find the role of the leadership style in generating work engagement to volunteers of humanity organization. The research method is by using Neuro-research. The calibration of the scoring sheet is by using Principle Component Avis approach through Varimax iteration (ratation) in which each reliability index ω is 0.781 and 0.873. Hypotheses test is conducted by using linear regression and classification regression tree (biner segmentation). The result of the research shows that (1)volunteers of humanity organization tend to sometimes engaged significantly at α< 0.05, (2) volunteers of humanity organization has the condition of leadership which tends to have an inspirational motivation significantly at α< 0.05, (3) there is an influence of leadership style towards work engagement of volunteers in humanity organization significantly at α< 0.01, and (4) inspirational motivation is a kind of leadership style which is the strongest in determining the work engagement of volunteers in the humanity organization significantly at α< 0.05 while to generate inspirational motivation is highly determined by improving the role of idealized influence (behavior) and contingent reward. Thus, based on the study is recommended to do some intervention for volunteers of humanity organization in order to increase the engagement by improving the leaders' self ability to be able to become an aspirator and motivator for humanity acts. © Serials Publications.","Neuroresearch; Trasformational Leadership; Work Engagement",,,,,,,,"Alshemmeri, F., Putih, A., Siraj, S., Khan, A., Abdallah, N., Art Ability and Academic Achievement in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: Role of Age and Sex (2011) New Educational Review, 26 (4), pp. 238-247; Bass, B.M., From transactional to transformational leadership - Learning to share the vision.pdf (1991) Organizational Dynamics; Bass, B.M., Waldman, D.A., Avolio, B.J., Bebb, M., Transformational leadership and the falling dominoes effect (1987) Group & Organization Management, 12 (1), p. 73; Breevaart, K., Bakker, A., Hetland, J., Demerouti, E., Olsen, O.K., Espevik, R., Daily transactional and transformational leadership and daily employee engagement (2014) Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 87 (1), pp. 138-157; Covey, S., The Transformational leadership report (2007) Transformational Leadership Journal, pp. 1-19; Dulagil, A., The relationship of employee engagement and wellbeing to organisational and student outcomes (2012) SBS HDR Student Conference, p. 1; Dvir, T., Eden, D., Avolio, B.J., Shamir, B., Impact of transformational leadership on follower development and performance: A field experiment (2002) Academy of Management Journal, 45 (4), pp. 735-744; Fios, F., Sasmoko, Gea, A.A., Neuro-Research Method: A Synthesis between Hermeneutics and Positivism (2016) Advanced Science Letters, 22 (9), pp. 2202-2206. , https://doi.org/10.1166/asl.2016.7565; Ghafoor, A., Qureshi, T.M., Khan, M.A., Hijazi, S.T., Transformational leadership, employee engagement and performance: Mediating effect of psychological ownership (2011) African Journal of Business Management, 5 (17), pp. 7391-7403. , https://doi.org/10.5897/AJBM11.126; Grant, A.M., Leading with meaning: Beneficiary contact, prosocial impact, and the performance effects of transformational leadership (2012) Academy of Management Journal, 55 (2), pp. 458-476; Hakanen, J.J., Schaufeli, W.B., Do burnout and work engagement predict depressive symptoms and life satisfaction?

Many of the newly recruited lecturers have only limited experiences on how to conduct a good learning session. This paper provides a diagnostic evaluation of the quality of lectures in a university in Tangerang. The research aims to find empirical evidence of: (1) the tendency of learning quality of lecturer at “new higher education institutions” in Tangerang regency, and (2) the most dominant indicator in determining the lecturers’ quality of the learning process at the “new higher education institutions” in Tangerang Regency. The research method use Neuroresearch (qualitative and quantitative). Then, for the data collecting use questionnaire that filled by students for all lesson in semester 2 and use Likert scale model with the data range from 1 to 5. The research found that the lecturer at the “new higher education institutions” in Tangerang Regency tend to have a high quality in the learning process with the significance level at; <0; 05. The main indicator that significantly affect the high quality of the lecturers teaching for two semesters is the factor of broad knowledge of the lecturer. This factor can increase because of the lecturer ability in imparting the university values. The implications of the research: the lecturer can use the feedback on the study to improve their performance at the new higher education institution. The lecturer also should have broad knowledge, ability to communicate well with students, and have a sense of nationality and dedication to Indonesia. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

This paper examines how prove the academic predictions (construt) in Neuroresearch through the construct validity. There are two (2) phases. Phase One, Orthogonal iteration approach. If the results of the Orthogonal iteration have been counted few times, and it is proved the instrument items to be significant with the variable (total score) and each indicator is minimum represented by at least 1 (one) point, then the academic predictions about the variables is proved. But if there is at least one indicator that is not represented by a minimum of 1 point, then the Orthogonal Iteration is not fit and had to go to the second stage. Second stage is Varimax Iterations approach through Principle Component Axis. The analogy of the variable is like a community that consists of a group of people (instrument item). Community (variable) is formed by a small group (indicator) and the members of the group (item) are not always correlated with the group (indicator). Proof of academic prediction of the second phase by calculating rotated component matrix which in the end, will “determine the new name of the indicators”. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.","A model research methods; Construct validity approach",,,,,,,,"Anne, A., (1982) Psychological Testing, , 5th edn., Macmillan Publishing Co, Inc., New York; Arthur, A., Elaine, A.N., (1999) Statistic for Psychology, , 2nd edn., Prentice-Hall Inc., New Jersey; Comrey, (1973) Factor Analysis, , Sagre Press, Chicago; Dimitrov, D.M., (2015) Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development, Sage Journal, , http://mec.sagepub.com; Gordon, F.D., (2011) Eksegesis Perjanjian Baru, , Literatur SAAT, Malang; Laurence, G.G., Paul, Y.R., (1995) Reading and Undestanding Multivariate Statistics, , American Psychological Association, Wahington; Larry, H.V., Ingram, O., (1985) Statistical Methods for Meta-Analysis, , Academic Press Inc., New York; Fred, K.N., Elazar, P.J., (1973) Multiple Regression in Behavioral Research, , Holt Rinehart and Winston Inc., New York; Fred, K.N., (1990) Asas-Asas Penelitian Behavioral, Terjemahan oleh Landung R.

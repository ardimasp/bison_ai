Unfortunately, only few high schools have a real robot arm for students to learn in their school labs. The purpose of this research is to create a small simulation program based on MATLAB® and Robotic Toolbox 9.10 which resembles Mitsubishi RV-M1 robotics arm. The simulation is a 3D view and 5 degree of freedom which its end-effectors position is as close as the real one. It is hoped the results of this research study can be used as a base for further development of human controlled robotics arms simulation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Risk management; Robotic arms; Robotics; Systems engineering; Degree of freedom; High school; High school students; High school teachings; Mitsubishi; Real robot; Research studies; Simulation program; MATLAB",,,,,"Merlet, J.P., (1993) IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation, 9, pp. 842-846; Jazar, R.N., (2010) Theory of Applied Robotics: Kinematics, Dynamics, and Control, , New York: Springer; Spong, M.W., Hutchinson, S., Vidyasagar, M., (2004) Robot Dynamics and Control, , http://smpp.northwestern.edu/savedLiterature/Spong_Textbook.pdf, 2nd edition [Accessed 2 May 2017]; Chen, J., Chao, L.M., (1987) IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation, 3, pp. 539-545; Basher, H.A., Modeling and simulation of flexible robot manipulator with a prismatic joint (2007) Proceedings 2007 IEEE SoutheastCon, , Richmond USA; (1996) Industrie-Roboter: Anwender-Handsbuch RV-M1 (Ratingen: Mitsubishi Electric Europe GMBH, , Anonymous; Kumar, R., Kalra, P., Prakash, N.R., (2011) Robot.

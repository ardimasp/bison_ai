This research surveyed 110 respondents who preferred to buy local bags and 110 respondents who preferred imported bags. The results suggest brand image has a positive and significant impact on customer satisfaction and behavioural intention for both local and imported brands. However, brand image of imported brands has a greater impact on customer satisfaction, whereas the customer satisfaction of local brands has a greater impact on customer behavioural intention. Consumers of local brands are more satisfied with local products and show greater positive behavioural intention. However, the brand image of imported brands are perceived as being better. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Behavioural intention; Brand image; Customer satisfaction; Imported brands; Local brands",,,,,,"Alexander, J., (2006) Handbook of Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty Measurement, , England: Gower; Ariestonandi, P., (2006) Marketing Research for Beginner; Panduan Praktis Riset Pemasaran Bagi Pemula, , Yogyakarta: Andi; Atmadji, E., Analisis impor Indonesia (2004) Jurnal Ekonomi Pembangunan, 9 (1), pp. 33-46; Davis, M., Baldwin, J., (2005) More Than A Name: An Introduction to Branding, , Switzerland: AVA Publishing SA; Gay, P., Hall, S., Janes, L., Mackay, H., Negus, K., (1997) Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of Sony Walkman (Culture, Media and Identities Sesries), , London: Sage Publications; Ghodeswar, M.B., Building brand identity in competitive markets: A conceptual model (2008) Journal of Product & Brand Management, 17 (1), pp. 4-12; Hsiung, L.C., A study on the relations between the brand image and customer satisfaction in catering business (2011) African Journal of Business Management, 5 (18), pp. 7732-7739; Japarianto, Budaya dan behavior intention mahasiswa dalam menilai service quality Universitas Kristen Petra (2006) Jurnal Manajemen Pemasaran, 1 (1), pp. 44-52; Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., (2008) Principles of Marketing, , Jakarta: Erlangga; Krupka, Z., Ozretic-Dosen, D., Presivic, J., Impact of perceived brand name origin on fashion brand’s perceived luxury (2014) Acta Polytechnia Hungarica, 11 (3), pp. 153-166; Li, X.G., Wang, X., Cai, Y.J., Corporate, product, and user image dimensions and purchase intentions (2011) Journal of Computers, 6 (9), pp. 1875-1879; Liang, R., Zhang, J., The effect of service interaction orientation on customer satisfaction and behavioral intention: The moderating effect of dining frequency (2012) Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics, 24 (1), pp. 153-170. , https://doi.org/10.1108/13555851211192740; Natalia, V.S., Handrimurtjahjo, A.D., Factors influencing behavioral intentions of television homeshopping with moderating effect of consumer satisfaction (2016) International Journal of Economics and Management, 10 (1), pp. 65-79; Riduwan, Kuncoro, E.A., (2008) Cara Menggunakan Dan Memaknai Analisis Jalur (Path Analysis), , Bandung: Alfabeta; Sangadji, E.M., Sopiah, (2013) Perilaku Konsumen, , Yogyakarta: Andi; Turhan, G., Özbek, A., Factors affecting consumer's behavioural intention towards apparel stores: A test of the mediating role of brand satisfaction (2013) Journal of FIBRES & TEXTILES in Eastern Europe, 1 (97), pp. 7-13; Zhang, Y., The impact of brand image on consumer behavior: A literature review (2015) Open Journal of Business and Management, 3 (1), pp. 58-62. , http://dx.doi.org/10.4236/ojbm.2015.31006","Natalia; Management Department, Indonesia; email: natalia@binus.edu",,,"Universiti Putra Malaysia",,,,,01287702,,,,"English","Pertanika J.

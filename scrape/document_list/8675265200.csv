A Tobit regression analysis with cluster-robust standard errors was then employed to find the effects of firm size, profitability, sales growth, financial leverage, and inter-period on the magnitude of dividend yield. This study finds that firm size, profitability, and sales growth positively influence the magnitude of dividends paid relative to stock prices received by shareholders. On the other hand, it also finds that financial leverage negatively affects dividends. Another result suggests the levels of dividends vary across time. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Dividend policies; Indonesia Stock Exchange; Manufacturing firms; Tobit regression",,,,,,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Indonesian Higher Education for funding this research.","Aivazian, V., Booth, L., Cleary, S., Do emerging market firms follow different dividend policies from U.S. firms?

The financial reporting process produces earnings viewed as increasingly ‘incomplete’ for valuation purposes by the capital market despite moves towards high-quality financial reporting standards (IFRS) during the sample period 1995–2015. Time-series analyses reveal that EQ decreases rather than increases through time. The role of earnings in valuation is replaced by other attributes, most notably net dividends. Firms that pay out dividends are valued significantly higher, and firms that issue equity are valued lower. These results are robust regardless of other accounting, market and governance controls. Large and closely held firms are valued higher than smaller firms, consistent with some aspects of the political cost hypothesis. Shares with higher idiosyncratic risk are valued higher, consistent with option value, as are shares where the volume of shares traded is more volatile. Collectively, the results indicate that the mere adoption of high-quality accounting standards (IFRS) and other nominal changes in capital market regulations do not automatically increase the quality of the financial reporting process. © 2018 CPA Australia",,,,,,,,"Akbar, S., Stark, A., Deflators, Net Shareholder Cash Flows, Dividends, Capital Contributions and Estimated Models of Corporate Valuation (2003) Journal of Business Finance & Accounting, 30 (9-10), pp. 1211-1233; Ball, R., Shivakumar, L., Earnings Quality in UK Private Firms: Comparative Loss Recognition Timeliness (2005) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 39 (1), pp. 83-128. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacceco.2004.04.001; Ball, R., Shivakumar, L., The Role of Accruals in Asymmetrically Timely Gain and Loss Recognition (2006) Journal of Accounting Research, 44 (2), pp. 207-242. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2006.00198.x; Ball, R., Robin, A., Wu, J.S., Incentives Versus Standards: Properties of Accounting Income in Four East Asian Countries (2003) Journal of Accounting & Economics, 361-3, pp. 235-270; Barth, M.E., Cram, D., Nelson, K., Accruals and Prediction of Future Cash Flows (2001) The Accounting Review, 76 (1), pp. 27-58. , https://doi.org/10.2308/accr.2001.76.1.27; Barth, M.E., Landsman, W.R., Raval, V., Wang, S., (2017) Asymmetric Timeliness and the Resolution of Investor Disagreement and Uncertainty at Earnings Announcements, , https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2348905, ’ Rock Center for Corporate Governance at Stanford University Working Paper 162; UNC Kenan-Flagler Research Paper; Basu, S., The Conservatism Principle and the Asymmetric Timeliness of Earnings (1997) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 24 (1), pp. 3-37. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S0165-4101(97)00014-1; Black, F., Scholes, M., The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities (1973) Journal of Political Economy, 813, pp. 637-654; Brown Jr, W.D., He, H., Teitel, K., Conditional Conservatism and the Value Relevance of Accounting Earnings: An International Study (2006) European Accounting Review, 15 (4), pp. 605-626. , https://doi.org/10.1080/09638180601102198; Burgstahler, D.C., Hail, L., Leuz, C., The Importance of Reporting Incentives: Earnings Management in European Private and Public Firms (2006) The Accounting Review, 81 (5), pp. 983-1016. , https://doi.org/10.2308/accr.2006.81.5.983; Cahan, S.B., The Effect of Antitrust Investigations on Discretionary Accruals: A Refined Test of the Political–Cost Hypothesis (1992) The Accounting Review, 67 (1), pp. 77-95; Chua, W.F., Taylor, S., The Rise and Rise of IFRS: An Examination of IFRS Diffusion (2008) Journal of Accounting & Public Policy, 276, pp. 462-473; Davis-Friday, P., Eng, L.L., Liu, C.-S., The Effects of the Asian Crisis, Corporate Governance and Accounting System on the Valuation of Book Value and Earnings (2006) The International Journal of Accounting, 41, pp. 22-40; Dechow, P.M., Accounting Earnings and Cash Flows as Measures of Firm Performance: The Role of Accounting Accruals (1994) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 18 (1), pp. 3-42. , https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-4101(94)90016-7; Dechow, P.M., Dichev, I.D., The Quality of Accruals and Earnings: The Role of Accrual Estimation Errors (2002) The Accounting Review, 77 (s-1), pp. 35-59. , https://doi.org/10.2308/accr.2002.77.s-1.35; Dechow, P.M., Ge, W., Schrand, C., Understanding Earnings Quality: A Review of the Proxies, Their Determinants and Their Consequences (2010) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 50 (2-3), pp. 344-401. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacceco.2010.09.001; Dichev, I.D., Graham, J.R., Harvey, C.R., Rajgopal, S., Earnings Quality: Evidence from the Field (2013) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 56 (2-3), pp. 1-33; Domadenik, P., Prašnikar, J., Svejnar, J., Restructuring of Firms in Transition: Ownership, Institutions and Openness to Trade (2008) Journal of International Business Studies, 39 (4), pp. 725-746. , https://doi.org/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400379; Domadenik, P., Prašnikar, J., Svejnar, Political Connectedness, Corporate Governance, and Firm Performance (2016) Journal of International Business Studies, 139 (2), pp. 411-428. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-015-2675-4; Dou, Y., Hope, O.-K., Thomas, B.W., Relationship-specificity, Contract Enforceability, and Income Smoothing (2013) The Accounting Review, 88 (5), pp. 1629-1656. , https://doi.org/10.2308/accr-50489; Ewert, R., Wagenhofer, A., Earnings Quality Metric and What They Measure (2011) SSRN Electronic Journal, , http://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1697042; Francis, J., LaFond, R., Olsson, P.M., Schipper, K., Costs of Equity and Earnings Attributes (2004) The Accounting Review, 79 (4), pp. 967-1010. , https://doi.org/10.2308/accr.2004.79.4.967; Francis, J., Schipper, K., Have Financial Statements Lost Their Relevance?

The findings of confirmatory factor analysis lead to conclude that the conceptual model fulfills the goodness of fit criteria.

Humans can sacrifice anything for health. Health needs to be supported by government facilities, one of which is a hospital. The development of hospitals in Indonesia is increasingly rapid. The availability of more hospitals needs to be supported by the resources available in the hospital. The problem that occurs at this time is that there are still many patients who complain about the lack of availability of resources both in terms of doctors, beds that must be included in the waiting schedule, medical technicians who sometimes queue up for blood collection, administrative processes that take a long time so patients are not immediately treated so on. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine the influence of resources (building area, general practitioners, specialist doctors, nurses, pharmacists, medical technicians, health workers, and non-health workers) on patients (outpatient, inpatient, and emergency room) ) in Indonesian hospitals. The method used is multiple regression with the help of SPSS 20. While the data taken is the population of all hospitals in Indonesia. The results obtained are three, first, building area, bed and medical conditions affect inpatient. Both general practitioners, medical technicians, health workers and non-health workers influence outpatients. Finally, beds, general practitioners, medical specialists, medical technicians, and health workers influence ED patients. Based on the results of these studies it can be suggested that the main focus for each type of patient needs to be considered especially those that have a significant effect. © 2019 iJOE.","Hospital; Patients; Regression; Resources",,,,,,,"Hn, S., (2015) Peranan Sektor Kesehatan dalam Pembangunan, , www.ajarekonomi.com:https://www.ajarekonomi.com/2015/12/kesehatan-sebagai-investasi-pembangunan.html, 12 17; Syukro, R., (2017) Ekonomi.

The analysis on this study is conducted using multiple regression analysis on the data that consists of free-float foreign ownership share in non-financial companies listed in the Indonesia Stock Exchange over the period 2014–2015. It is found that foreigners prefer holding stocks in larger investability and firm sizes, higher dividends, and the consumer goods industry sector. Aside from well-established firm-specific determinants of the degree of foreign ownerships in the literature that foreigner invest more in shares of large firms in a particular industry sector with higher dividends, this study also provides evidence that foreign investors require widely available shares for their investment in a foreign country. Understanding the determinants of foreign investors’ preferences may provide valuable insights for policy makers and Indonesian firms in attempts to attract foreign investment to the stock market. © 2018, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Foreign ownership; Free-float share; Indonesia Stock Exchange; Investability size",,,,,,,"Adler, M., Dumas, B., International portfolio choice and corporation finance: A synthesis (1983) Journal of Finance, 38 (3), pp. 925-984; Ahearne, A.G., Griever, W.L., Warnock, F.E., Information costs and home bias: An analysis of US holdings of foreign equities (2004) Journal of International Economics, 62, pp. 313-336; Akyüz, Y., The global economic crisis and trade and growth prospects in East Asia (2011) ADB Economics Working Paper Series, 242; Andrade, S.C., Chhaochharia, V., Information immobility and foreign portfolio investment (2010) Review of Financial Studies, 23, pp. 2429-2463; Bolak, M., Diyarbakirlioglu, E., Süer, Ö., Foreign ownership and financial information (2013) EuroMed Journal of Business, 8 (2), pp. 154-171; Choi, N., Fedenia, M., Skiba, H., Sololk, T., Portfolio concentration and performance of institutional investors worldwide (2017) Journal of Financial Economics, 123 (1), pp. 189-208; Coval, J.D., Moskowitz, T.J., Home bias at home: Local equity preference in domestic portfolios (1999) Journal of Finance, 54 (6), pp. 2045-2073; Dahlquist, M., Robertsson, G., Direct foreign ownership, institutional investors, and firm characteristics (2001) Journal of Financial Economics, 59, pp. 413-440; Dahlquist, M., Pinkowitz, L., Stulz, R., Williamson, R., Corporate governance and home bias (2003) Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 38 (1), pp. 135-157; Falkenstein, E.G., Preferences for stock characteristics as revealed by mutual fund portfolio holdings (1996) Journal of Finance, 51 (1), pp. 111-135; Fama, E.F., French, K.R., Size and book-to-market factors in earnings and returns (1995) Journal of Finance, 50, pp. 131-155; Fedenia, M., Skiba, H., Sokolyk, T., (2017) Familiarity with a foreign market and institutional investors’ performance, , Working Paper, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Colorado State University, and Brock University; Gompers, P.A., Metrick, A., Institutional investors and equity prices (2001) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 116 (1), pp. 229-259; Holland, S.B., Warnock, F.E., Firm-level access to international capital markets: Evidence from Chilean equities (2003) Emerging Markets Review, 4, pp. 39-51; Huberman, G., Familiarity breeds investment (2001) Review of Financial Studies, 14 (3), pp. 659-680; Kang, J., Stulz, R., Why is there a home bias?

IC is an intangible asset that has been acknowledged by various researchers to be the most important asset of a firm and its roles are to shape and integrate tangible assets into value creation processes. In this study, IC was proxied by VAIC and the operating performance was represented by ROA, OPM, and ATO. The sample in this study consists of Indonesian firms in the hospitality industry between the year of 2007 and 2011. This study found out that IC had limited role in driving profitability of a firm. When VAIC was broken down into tangible assets (VACA) and intangible assets (VAHU and STVA), the most dominant which is pushing the profitability of companies is still tangible assets. VACA is even comparable with size and leverage in getting firms profitable. Human capital (VAHU) is the weakest link in value creation of the firms at the hospitality industry in Indonesia. Finally, structural capital (STVA) increases productivity only through reduction of the costs in doing businesses not in revenue increases. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

This study finds that prior to the crisis, share returns did not lead earnings, and accounting practices in Indonesia failed to utilise accruals for reducing cash flow noise as well as to demonstrate conservatism in financial reporting preparation. In the post-crisis period, although there is evidence that stock returns led earnings and that accruals were utilised properly in noise reductions, accounting practices in Indonesia still did not exhibit the accepted level of conservatism.","Accounting conservatism; Asian financial crisis; Asymmetric recognition; Indonesia",,,,,,,"Ball, R., Kothari, S.P., Robin, A., The effect of international institutional factors on properties of accounting earnings (2000) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 29 (1), pp. 1-51; Ball, R., Shivakumar, L., The role of accruals in asymmetrically timely gain and loss recognition (2006) Journal of Accounting Research, 42 (2), pp. 207-242; Ball, R., Shivakumar, L., Earnings quality in UK private firms: Comparative loss recognition timeliness (2005) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 39 (1), pp. 83-128; Ball, R., Robin, A., Wu, J.S., Incentives versus standards: Properties of accounting income in four East Asian countries (2003) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 36 (1-3), pp. 235-270; Basu, S., The Conservatism principle and the asymmetric timeliness of earnings (1997) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 24, pp. 3-37; Basu, S., Conservatism and the asymmetric timeliness of earnings (1995) PHD Dissertation, , NY: University of Rochester; Browning, E.S., Weil, J., Burden of doubt: Stocks take a beating as accounting worries spread beyond Enron (2002) Wall Street Journal, 30, pp. A1. , January; (2005) Indonesian Capital Market Master Plan 2005-2009, , Capital Market Supervisory Agency (BAPEPAM), Jakarta: Badan Pengawas Pasar Modal; Christie, A.A., Aggregation of test statistics: An evaluation of the evidence on contracting and size hypotheses (1990) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 12 (1-3), pp. 15-36; Claessens, S., Djankov, S., Lang, L.H.P., The separation of ownership and control in East Asian corporations (2000) Journal of Financial Economics, 58 (1-2), pp. 81-112; Dechow, P.M., Accounting earnings and cash flows as measures of firm performance: The role of accounting accruals (1994) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 18 (1), pp. 3-42; Diga, J., Yunus, H., Accounting in Indonesia (1997) Accounting In the Asia-Pacific Region, , In Baydoun, N., Nishimura, A., & Willet.

This mis-allocation arises when internal cash is not allocated efficiently between divisions with differences in growth opportunities. We show that differences in growth opportunities can predict subsequent spinoffs. We also show that differences in growth opportunities are better predictors of spinoffs than either the SIC codes that are used in the corporate focus explanation of spinoffs, or the usual estimates of free cash flow as applied to the conglomerate. © 2003 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Capital mis-allocation; Cash flow",,,,,,,"Allen, J.W., Lummer, S.L., McConnel, J.J., Reed, D.K., Can takeover losses explain spin-off gains (1995) Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 30, pp. 465-485; Berger, P.G., Ofek, E., Corporate focus and stock returns (1995) Journal of Financial Economics, 37, pp. 39-65; Comment, R., Jarrell, G.A., Corporate focus and stock returns (1995) Journal of Financial Economics, 37, pp. 67-87; Cusatis, P.J., Miles, J.A., Woolridge, J.R., Restructuring through spinoffs: The stock market evidence (1993) Journal of Financial Economics, 33, pp. 293-311; Daley, L., Mehrotra, V., Sivakumar, R., Corporate focus and value creation: Evidence from spinoffs (1997) Journal of Financial Economics, 45, pp. 257-281; Galai, D., Masulis, R., The option pricing model and the risk factor of stock (1976) Journal of Financial Economics, 3, pp. 53-81; Hite, G.L., Owers, G.E., Security price reactions around corporate spinoff announcements Journal of Financial Economics, 12, pp. 409-436; Jensen, M.C., Agency costs of free cash flow, corporate finance and takeovers (1986) American Economic Review, 76, pp. 323-329; Lament, O., Cash flow and investment: Evidence from internal capital markets (1997) Journal of Finance, 52, pp. 83-109; Scharfstein, D., Stein, J., The dark side of internal capital markets: Divisional rent-seeking and inefficient investment (1997) National Bureau of Economic Research, , Working Paper No. 5969; Scharfstein, D., The dark side of internal capital markets II: Evidence from diversified conglomerates (1998) National Bureau of Economic Research, , Working Paper No. 6352; Schipper, K., Smith, A., Effects of recontracting on shareholder wealth: The case of voluntary spinoffs (1983) Journal of Financial Economics, 12, pp. 437-467; Shin, H.H., Stultz, R.M., Are internal capital markets efficient?

Our research aims to broaden the insights of businesspeople, regarding how to integrate and manage the benefits of implementing governance risk and compliance. The research method in this research is qualitative research. We use primary data from interviews with informants, besides that we also use secondary data in the form of published research papers and reports related to GRC. The results show that if the company is able to implement GRC effectively, it will have an impact on the company, including being able to predict and analyze possible risks in the future. © 2020 EManuscript Technologies.

However, the system for MSMEs are unknown and unconstructed, especially with the development of information and communication technology that affect the sustainability and productivity of MSMEs. Therefore, this study’s first objective is to build a model that contains MSMEs model in macroscopic view with the involvement of ICT to enhance income for MSMEs. Second objective is to determine what recommendations should be given to raise the economic development received from MSMEs involvement according to the model. The results are a causal loop model is built based on previous researches about MSMEs that combine factors and important elements in the system. Based on the diagram, there are three recommendations given to the Government: trainings to MSMEs about ICT for their businesses, continuing to apply tax reduction for MSMEs, and enhancing their market shares by internalization process. © BEIESP.","ICT;

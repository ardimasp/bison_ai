One of the most important factors of the bridge is the abutment. Abutment is a structure, built at the edge of the bridge. Abutment is designed to hold the weight of the bridge and over the bridge. The structure of abutment usually planted in to the river. One of methods to minimize the scour impact is considering the shape and design of abutment. This research aims to find out the effect of abutment model or shape variation (semi-circular end abutment, wing wall abutment and spill through abutment) toward the change of velocity using Flow-3D for numerical modeling, the physical test to validation the flow condition and analyze the characteristic sediment transport pattern using Hjulstörm curve. The result of research state that the spill through abutment is the most effective model to keep the stability of flow velocity around the abutment. Correlation between Froude Number (Fr) with Relative Longitudinal Distance Ratio is discussed in this paper. Then, Hjulstörm curve shows that with bed material diameter (d 50) of 0,54 mm, sediment transport in the entire abutment model located at erosion zone. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Abutment; Flow-3D; Hjulstrm curve; sediment transport; velocity","Failure (mechanical); Flow velocity; Scour; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Velocity; Bridge failures; Change of velocities; Flow velocity characteristics; FLOW-3D; Hjulstrm curve; Longitudinal distance; Sediment transport pattern; Shape variations; Abutments (bridge)",,,,"12/KM/PNT/2019, 039/VR

For the cable-stayed bridge, the cable receives the load from the bridge deck and transfer it to the pylon. As the ambient temperature change, the internal force in bridge element including stayed cable will change. This research investigate the ambient temperature effect to the tension force of stayed cable of cable-stayed bridge by comparing the result of finite element model analysis with the field measurement form electromagnetic sensor data. The finite element model of Merah Putih Cable-Stayed Bridge has been developed based on detailed engineering design data. The finite element model is validated using the natural frequency data from dynamic load test of the bridge. The ambient temperature and bridge elements temperature were measured for 24 hours. The finite element analysis were conducted based on field measurement data and the contribution of pylon and girder temperature to the cable tension forces variation was investigated. The output of finite element analysis then compared to the actual cable tension as measured by an electromagnetic sensor. It was found that the ambient temperature will affecting the magnitude of tension force at stay cable and the variation of cable tension has similar pattern of both from the finite element model and electromagnetic data. As the temperature of bridge element increases or decreases, the bridge will experience a deformation. Since the stay cable connected to the pylon at one side and to the girder at the other side, its will make the stay cable elongated or contracted which in turn will affecting the tension force at stay cable. When evaluating the bridge condition based on the tension force at stay cable, the effect of temperature variation need to be considered. © BEIESP.","Cable; Cable tension; Cable-stayed bridge; Electromagnetic sensor; Finite element method; Temperature",,,,,"Binus University: 12/AKM/PNT/2019","This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Pengaruh Suhu Terhadap Perubahan Gaya di Kabel Jembatan” or “Temperature Effect to Cable Force Variation of Bridge” with contract number: 12/AKM/PNT/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","Chen, C., Wu, W., Liu, C., Effects of temperature variation on cable forces of an extradosed bridge (2012) 6Th European Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring; Vairo, G., Montassar, S., Mechanical modelling of stays under thermal loads (2012) Mechanics, Models and Methods, LNACM, 61, pp. 481-498; Suangga, M., Hidayat, I., Yuliastuti, C., Temperature effect on cable tension forces of cable-stayed bridge (2018) The 2Nd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, , 2018; Wang, L., Wu, Y., Thermal effect on damaged stay-cable (2014) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, 52 (4), pp. 1071-1082; Zhao, Y., Zhao, Y., Sun, C., Wang, Z., Temperature effect on tension forces and frequencies of suspended cables (2014) Proceedings of the 9Th International Conference on Structural Dynamics; Zhou, Y., Sun, L., Sun, S., Temperature field and its effect on a long-span steel cable-stayed bridge based on monitoring data (2013) The Thirteenth East Asia-Pacific Conference on Structural Engineering and Construction, pp. EASEC-13",,,,"Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication",,,,,22498958,,,,"English","Int.

Using integration of Geometric Information System (GIS) technology and urban storm water models, the performance of urban drainage system can be analysed.[1] Especially in coastal area, the main problem of urban drainage is overloaded capacity because of rapid urbanization and coastal floods caused by storm surges and wave action superimposed on high water levels generated during the cycle of tides. Land use change, watershed area as settlements area, clogged drainage pipe/channel, the changing of imperviousness of land cover also contributes to large volume of surface runoff. Moreover, the developments can change land cover in urban area and increasing rainfall runoff. One of the solutions for coastal urban drainage is by using polder system for flood control. The purpose of this paper is to illustrated how GIS can model the catchment discretization and MIKE URBAN-SWMM (Storm Water Management Model) can analyse water balance based on the rainfall return period of 25, 50 and 100 years. The research shows evaluation result of the polder performance including inundation depth and pump performance by linking GIS between storm water models. The case study is analysing the Pluit polder in Jakarta-Indonesia, which is connected to the Indonesia Central Bank compartment. Based on the model, this polder system can reduce flooding in Indonesia Central Bank Compartment up to 50%, however the inundation is still occurred. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The result of the analysis using Finite Element Method then compared with the available field measurement data. To validate the finite element model, the dynamic finite element model of the bridge will be compared with the dynamic properties of the bridge from dynamic testing of actual bridge. It was found from the finite element model that he effects of temperature on the cable force is linear and the girder and pylon stiffness has significant contribution to the variation of cable tension force due to temperature change.

However, some of these bridges are failed due to channel bed degradation and scouring. Bridge scour is one of the main causes of bridge failure. To prevent this condition, it is very crucial to thoroughly understanding the river behavior changes at the upstream and downstream area of bridge and barrage constructions. After that, the proper operation and preventive maintenance of bridges and barrages can be formulated. In this study, we identified the indicator parameters that are associated with hydraulic channel and potentially scour the bridge. The objective of this study is to develop a scouring assessment based on the river flow regime. In the assessment, the structures is the indicators status and the performance of the bridge component which will be measured in order to assess the bridge failures performance, and recommendations are proposed to obtain the results by using visual inspection method. The assessment models is an evaluation of the river regime condition using inspection and other direct measures to determine the effect of river condition related with deterioration. The study result shows that the main component to assess the performance of bridge are hydraulic channel, riverbank, and floodplain. The assessment is conducted at the upstream and downstream area of the bridge. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

However in a construction project, contractor often has their own cost estimation based on their own calculation. This research aimed to compare the construction project total cost using calculation based on the Ministerial Regulation of Public Work No. 11/2013 against the contractor's calculation. Two projects were used as case study to compare the results. The projects were a 4 storey building located in Pantai Indah Kapuk area (West Jakarta) and a warehouse located in Sentul (West Java) which was built by 2 different contractors. The cost estimation from both contractors' calculation were compared to the one based on the Ministerial Regulation of Public Work No. 11/2013. It is found that there were differences between the two calculation around 1.80 % - 3.03% in total cost, in which the cost estimation based on Ministerial Regulation was higher than the contractors' calculations. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","building contractor; construction project; cost estimation; ministerial regulation","Construction; Contractors; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Engineering research; Public works; Building contractors; Construction projects; Cost estimations; Indonesia; Jakarta; ministerial regulation; West javas; Cost estimating",,,,,,"Rad Parviz, F., (2001) Project Estimating and Cost Management.

Cables are used in a variety of structures that employ their unique characteristics to create efficient design tension members. The condition of the cable forces in the cable supported structure is an important indication of judging whether the structure is in good condition. Several methods have been developed to measure on site cable forces. Vibration technique using correlation between natural frequency and cable forces is a simple method to determine in situ cable forces, however the method need accurate information on the boundary condition, cable mass, and cable length. The natural frequency of the cable is determined using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) Technique to the acceleration record of the cable. Based on the natural frequency obtained, the cable forces then can be determine by analytical or by finite element program. This research is focus on the vibration techniques to determine the cable forces, to understand the physical parameter effect of the cable and also modelling techniques to the natural frequency and cable forces. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","cable forces; FFT Technique; natural frequency; vibration","Fast Fourier transforms; Natural frequencies; Cable forces; Cable-supported structure; FFT (fast Fourier transform); FFT techniques; Finite element programs; Modelling techniques; vibration; Vibration techniques; Cables",,,,,,"Casas, J.R., A combined method for measuring cable forces: The cable-stayed Alamillo Bridge, Spain, Structural Enginering International (1994) Journal of the IABSE, 4, pp. 235-240. , November; Debora, S.N., Parivallal, S., Ravisankar, K., Hemalatha, G., Evaluation of Cable Tension Using Vibration Based Methodologies for Health Monitoring of Structures (2015) IJIRSET, 4; Chang, S.-P., Nonlinear Dynamic Analysis of Spatial Suspended Elasti Catenary Cable with Finite Element Method (2008) KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering, 12 (2), pp. 121-128; Alice, E., (2006), Measurement and Evaluation of Cable Forces in the Alvsborg Bridge (Stockholm: Royal Institute of Technology) Master Thesis; Erwin, K., (2006) Advanced Engineering Mathematic, , 9 (Hoboken: Wiley); Steiveman, D.B., (1953), (New York: Wiley amp; Sons Inc) A Practical Treatise on Suspension Bridges; Walther, R., (1988) Cable Stayed Bridges, , (London: L Thomas Telford Ltd) William Crozier, Penerjemah; Hiroki, Y., (1992), (Thailand: Asian Institute of Technology) Structural Dynamics; Rastandi Josia, I., (University of Indonesia) Presentation Material - Presentasi Jembatan Siak III by Dr. Ing","Suangga, M.; Civil Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: suangga@binus.edu","Kasih T.P.","","Institute of Physics Publishing","International Conference on Eco Engineering Development 2017, ICEED 2017","14 November 2017 through 15 November 2017",,133427,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The placement of beams at the whole edges of slab, so that the load received by the slab can be transfer into beams. The slab will be deformed/deflection when the loads are given. The value of slab deflection is dependent on the placement of beam support at the edges. This research was conducted on the two boundary condition that is simple support at the two edges and rigid support at whole edges. Calculating the value of deflection based on the results of field measurements and then compared with Marcus Levy method and Finite element method (FEM). Based on the study, the numbers of mesh affected to the value of deflection. The results of deflection with Program SAP 2000 will be approached deflection by Method M. Levy for the mesh division with large numbers. The deflection of slab on the field measurement approached manual calculations and Program SAP2000 with a simple support at the surrounding the edges. The comparison of deflection was obtained for the simple support based on manual calculations and field measurement has a difference of 0.3% - 1%. Where the value of deflection on the field measurement is smaller than the manual calculation. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press.

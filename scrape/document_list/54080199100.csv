This opportunity is due to the abundant amount of information shared by the user. This fact is especially true for countries with high number of active social media users such as Indonesia. Extraction of information from social media can yield insightful results if done correctly. Recent studies have managed to leverage associations between language and personality and build a personality prediction system based on those associations. The current study attempts to build a personality prediction system based on a Twitter user's information for Bahasa Indonesia, the native language of Indonesia. The personality prediction system is built on Support Vector Machine and XGBoost trained with 329 instances (users). Evaluation results using 10-fold cross validation shows that the system managed to reach highest average accuracy of 76.2310% with Support Vector Machine and 97.9962% with XGBoost. © 2017 PTI.",,"Forecasting; Information systems; Support vector machines; 10-fold cross-validation; Amount of information; Automated analysis; Evaluation results; Extraction of information; Native language; Personality predictions; Status updates; Social networking (online)",,,,"Kementerian Riset, Teknologi dan Pendidikan Tinggi

The aim of this study was to assess whether and which cognitive (perceptual, attentional, or memory) processes are impaired during the first 48 hours after a migraine attack.Methods: Three different cognitive tasks (global-local task, the attentional network task, and N-back task) were administered to 16 migraine patients (13 migraine without aura; mean age 58 years, 15 female) and 18 controls (59 years, 15 female), matched on age, gender, and educational level. Tasks were administered at three time points; during the first headache free day following a migraine attack (first session), 24 hours later (second session), and 12 days after the attack (third session).Results: The attentional network and N-back tasks showed no significant differences between migraineurs and controls. In the global-local task, controls showed faster reaction times to global than to local stimuli, which is the standard global-precedence effect. This effect was absent in the migraineurs in all three sessions, especially if they used prophylaxis.Conclusion: Migraineurs had no impaired attentional or working-memory functioning in the 2 days after an attack. They did show impairments in the processing of global visual features compared with controls, both between and immediately after an attack. © International Headache Society 2011.","Attention; cognition; memory; migraine; perceptual organization","adult; article; attention; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; male; migraine; perception; reaction time; task performance; working memory; Aged; Attention; Cognition Disorders; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Middle Aged; Migraine with Aura; Orientation; Reaction Time; Time Factors; Visual Perception",,,,"Medtronic

However, the behavioral intention to use language learning apps has not been maximized. The purpose of this study is to explore the factors of Indonesian millennial behavioral intention to use language learning apps, then find out whether those factors influence Indonesian millennial behavioral intention to use language learning apps significantly, and finally identify the Indonesian millennial segmentation in language learning apps industry based on the factors of behavioral intention to use. This research uses both qualitative and quantitative methods. The results of the research show that there are 13 variables that affect Indonesian millennial behavioral intention to use language learning apps; then based on those 13 variables, 3 millennial segments are formed, namely The Thirst Learners Skill segment, The Ease-comfort Seekers segment, and The Worth-it Strivers with different characteristics. © 2020 IEEE.","Behavioral intention to use;

It examines how brand preference, shopping convenience, and adoption level influence purchase intention, and to identify market segmentation of online groceries in Jakarta; the three independent variables are used as segmentation basis. This is an associative-descriptive research based on a survey of 200 respondents in Jakarta. Data is analysed using linear regression and cluster analysis. The results show brand preference, shopping convenience, and consumer adoption level significantly influence purchase intention. Using these independent variables, this research categorised four groups of online shoppers in Jakarta that consist of trail blazer that can be approached by online brand community, socialiser that can be lured by utilising their purchasing data history to create personalised offering, assured achiever that can be reached through educating the market, and community traditionalist that can be approached using a pricing strategy. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Adoption level; Brand preference market; Convenience; Online grocery shopping; Purchase intention; Segmentation",,,,,,"The purchase intention of customers can be associated with their adoption behavior toward the purchasing technology of grocery products. Preliminary data showed 26% of respondents agreed that technology that supports the system as well as sites/apps are an important factor to influence their online shopping. Interviews with marketing managers of online grocery stores in Jakarta revealed that the biggest challenge in influencing consumer shopping habits lies in educate consumers to switch from traditional grocery shopping at a supermarket to an online shopping system. It is easier to offer consumers who are tech-savvy or familiar with technology to adopt this new system. Nielsen (2015) stated the rank of market adoption varies, but until now the new e-commerce market was only able to tap into the tech-savvy. This finding was supported by Ahmed, Jamal, Ismail and Rezai (2013) who found rate of technology adoption attracts consumers to transact online. Srivastava, Chandra and Theng (2010) examined the level of consumer adoption, which is based on the phenomenon that consumer adoption of mobile payment solutions is low compared with traditional forms of payments. Irani, Dwivedi and Williams (2009) produced similar findings that despite broadband offering several benefits to consumers over its previous narrowband technology, many countries are still experiencing a low level of adoption.","Ahmed, A.F., Jamal, A.S., Ismail, M.M., Rezai, G., A preliminary investigation of factors influencing consumer adoption of online transaction in Malaysia (2013) African Journal of Business Management, 7 (41), pp. 4247-4253; Akdeniz, A., Effect of perceived values on the brand preference and the purchase intention (2012) European Scientific Journal, 8 (17), pp. 1-17; Chen, Y.H., Hsu, I.C., Lin, C.C., Website attributes that increase consumer purchase intention: A conjoint analysis (2010) Journal of Business Research, 63, pp. 1007-1014; Cristobal, E., Marimon, F., Daries, N., Montagut, Y., Spanish E-consumer segmentation and positioning in virtual supermarkets sector (2011) International Journal of Marketing Studies, 3 (2), pp. 16-31; (2014), http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Global-B2C-Ecommerce-Sales-Hit-15-Trillion-This-Year-Driven-by-Growth-Emerging-Markets/1010575, February 3); Fygenson, M., Pavlou, P.A., Understanding and predicting electronic commerce adoption: An extension of the theory of planned behaviour (2006) MIS Quarterly, 30 (1), pp. 115-143; Ghosh, A., (1990) Retail Management, , Chicago: Drydden press; Gunawan, A., Diana, B., Muchardie, B.G., Sitinjak, M.F., The effect of involvement and Electronic Word of Mouth (eWOM) on brand image and its impact on consumers brand switching of Mamypoko (2016) International Journal of Economics and Management, 10 (S1), pp. 19-31; Gunawan, A., Melati, I., Muchardie, B.G., Analysis of kids apparel market segmentation amongst millennial moms (An implication for kids apparel retailer in Jakarta) (2016) 27 th IBIMA Conference Proceedings; Haider, M.U., Jan, F.A., Jan, F.M., Jan, F.M., Factors effecting brand preferences: A comparative study of McDonald’s and KFC (2013) Abasyn Journal of Social Sciences, 5 (2), pp. 28-42; He, D., Lu, Y., Zhou, D., Empirical study of consumers’ purchase intentions in C2C electronic commerce (2008) Tsinghua Science and Technology, 13 (3), pp. 287-292; (2013), https://www.idea.or.id/assets/materi/idEA.pdf, February); Irani, Z., Dwivedi, Y.K., Williams, M.D., Understanding consumer adoption of broadband: An extension of the technology acceptance model (2009) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 60 (10), pp. 1322-1334; Jaafar, S.N., Lalp, P.E., Naba, M.M., Consumers’ perceptions, attitudes and purchase intention towards private label food products in Malaysia (2013) Asian Journal of Business and Management Sciences, 2 (8), pp. 73-90; (2015) Are You Ready for Online Grocery Shopping – Survey Report, , https://blog.jakpat.net/ready-online-grocery-shopping-survey-report/, April; Jiang, L.A., Yang, Z., Jun, M., Measuring consumer perceptions of online shopping convenience (2013) Journal of Service Management, 24 (2), pp. 191-214; Kashanizadeh, Z., Esfidani, R.M., A survey on antecedents of brand preference (A case of Samsung on audio and video products) (2014) European Online Journal of Natural and Social Sciences, 3 (4), pp. 882-891; Kim, J.O., Jin, B.H., Korean consumers’ patronage of discount stores: Domestic vs. Multinational discount stored shoppers’ profile (2001) Journal of Consumer Marketing, 18 (3), pp. 236-255; Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., (2016) Principles of Marketing, , 16th ed.).

A phenomenon that emerged lately is the millennial moms are busy uploading photos of their children in such a way they dress through various social media like Facebook, Instagram, and Path. Although Millennials form a potential market segment, but Millennials is not a homogeneous group, so that millennial moms' shopping behavior can not be uniform due to the diversity of characteristics, both demographic and psychographic. To that end, it is important for marketers, especially kids apparel retailer, to divide this market into segments that are more specific, so that each segment can obtain a different treatment from marketers. The purpose of this study was to establish a kids apparel market segmentation based on the behavior of the millennial moms and determine whether there are differences in demographic characteristics between the segments formed, to eventually be able to provide recommendations for marketers of kids apparel retailer in Jakarta related to the differences in the character of the segments exist. Data was collected by survey method through questionnaires which are distributed to 306 people millennial moms in Jakarta. The analysis technique used is Cluster Analysis and Multiple Discriminant Analysis. Results from this study stated that there are 4 segments formed, namely shopping maniac moms, buy whatever moms, too much thinking moms, and reasonable choice-making moms, where there are significant differences in shopping behavior among the four segments.

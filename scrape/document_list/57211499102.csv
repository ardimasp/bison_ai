From the application that went through very important developments from desktop-based applications to web-based applications to mobile-based applications as the latest development. But maintenance of mobile applications will be done more often, because the mobile applications are very dependent on the application service and API used to retrieve data in the database and to display information that is displayed in mobile applications. The goal is to discover the preparation that needs to be done by the developer so that the transfer of technology to micro services still gives the user a comfortable feeling without any interference. Preparing for migration from monoliths to microservices is modularization of application source code, modularization of databases and cloud servers such as the Google cloud platform if you want to stay on your own server © 2020 IEEE.","Application; Microservices; Migrating; Monolith","Application programming interfaces (API); Mobile computing; Modular construction; Web services; Application services; Cloud platforms; Latest development; Mobile applications; Modularizations; Organizational management; Transfer of technology; Web-based applications; Information management",,,,,"Richardson, C., (2016) Refactoring A Monolith into Microservices-NGINX, , https://www.nginx.com/blog/refactoring-a-monolith-intomicroservices/, [Accessed: 15-Jul-2019]; Larrucea, X., Santamaria, I., Colomo-Palacios, R., Ebert, C., (2018) Microservices; Ren, Q., Li, S., Method of refactoring a monolith into microservices (2018) J.

The data used is the data of student learning transactions in 2016 and 2017 as many as 16000. There are 4 assessment indicators of distance learning student learning outcomes, namely Forum discussion (FOD), Personal assignment (PAS), TAS and Quiz (QIZ). The technique is then discussed in terms of prediction accuracy, using machine learning with the Naïve Bayes algorithm with the Rapid Miner application. The results state that student activity in the FOD discussion forum is the biggest indicator that influences student learning outcomes. With performance vector result accuracy of 84.03%. With an active group discussion forum with diverse backgrounds and student characteristics, most of which are workers showing activities, the discussion forum provides knowledge sharing between students and lecturers in the learning process to be both very good and important. © 2019 IEEE.","distance learning; Machine learning; Naïve bayes; online learning; recommender system","Distance education; Engineering education; Forecasting; Machine learning; Assessment indicator; Group discussions; Knowledge-sharing; Learning achievement; Performance vectors; Prediction accuracy; Student characteristics; Student learning outcomes; Students",,,,,"Kaewkiriya, T., Utakrit, N., Tiantong, M., The design of a rule base for an e-learning recommendation system base on multiple intelligences (2015) Int.

The design method used is DSDLC (Database System Development Lifecycle). The results achieved in this study are application prototypes in the form of Application Programming Interface (API). This study found the fact that the broad match ad keyword system was based on the ad keyword search feature at PT. XYZ has not been able to search for keywords without regard to the order of the search keywords. Based on this, this study determines the workings of broad match keyword features by applying the search rules broad matching, synonym, and stemming into the existing ad keyword search system. Keyword analysis uses the rules of broad matching, synonym, and stemming. The results can be implemented in the form of ElasticSearch analyzer. © 2018 IEEE.","Application Programming Interface; Broad Match; Elasticsearch Analyzer","Intelligent systems; Life cycle; Product design; Search engines; Advertising systems; Broad Match; Elasticsearch Analyzer; Feature analysis; Keyword search; Product advertisements; Search keyword; System development; Application programming interfaces (API)",,,,,"Arisantoso, H., Dan Saefullah, A., Analisa pengaruh penggunaan search engine optimization (seo) pada website e-commerce (2015) Seminar Nasional Sistem Informasi Indonesia, 1 (1), pp. 33-40; Djuric, N., Wu, H., Radosavljevic, V., Grbovic, M., Bhamidipati, N., Hierarchical neural language models for joint representation of streaming documents and their content (2015) Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 248-255. , May).

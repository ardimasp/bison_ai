The Pattern of Adaptive Learning Scales (PALS) was used to measure the academic efficacy and goal orientation. The finding revealed that mastery goal orientation is a considerable factor for academic achievement.

This opportunity is due to the abundant amount of information shared by the user. This fact is especially true for countries with high number of active social media users such as Indonesia. Extraction of information from social media can yield insightful results if done correctly. Recent studies have managed to leverage associations between language and personality and build a personality prediction system based on those associations. The current study attempts to build a personality prediction system based on a Twitter user's information for Bahasa Indonesia, the native language of Indonesia. The personality prediction system is built on Support Vector Machine and XGBoost trained with 329 instances (users). Evaluation results using 10-fold cross validation shows that the system managed to reach highest average accuracy of 76.2310% with Support Vector Machine and 97.9962% with XGBoost. © 2017 PTI.",,"Forecasting; Information systems; Support vector machines; 10-fold cross-validation; Amount of information; Automated analysis; Evaluation results; Extraction of information; Native language; Personality predictions; Status updates; Social networking (online)",,,,"Kementerian Riset, Teknologi dan Pendidikan Tinggi

Differentiated instruction (DI) is put forward as a key solution but seems challenging. In this study, actual DI implementation of teachers is linked to a complex set of variables: teachers' DI self-efficacy, teaching beliefs, teaching experience, professional development, teacher certification, and classroom size. The findings show that DI implementation seems high, but is still below a critical benchmark. The regression analysis results indicate 39% of the variation in DI implementation which can significantly linked to DI self-efficacy beliefs, higher constructivist beliefs and higher classroom size.

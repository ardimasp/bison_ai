In this case, because of the need for the world of education and coupled with most Japanese people not wanting to use languages other than the original language, Japanese language is now a very important language. On the other hand it is also seen from a person's language skills, based on the results of a survey of 100 international students who continued their studies in Japan, 81 said Japanese was difficult to understand, because the letters were different from ordinary alphabet letters. Therefore we need a new learning model to attract interest and improve one's Japanese language skills. The model was adopted into the game, by using games it is expected that players can understand the letters hiragana and katakana. The game-making method uses a modified game development life cycle so that game creation can be done maximally and flexibly. Then, by adopting the concept of shodo it can produce proportional writing. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The cat owners need to answer questionnaire to detect what disease is suffering by their cat. The result of the disease is also accompanied by the first treatment that cat owners can do to treat their cats. In addition, this application also has a feature that provides information, tips and tricks in cat care. The research methods used to analyze the development of this application are literature study through books, journals and e-books. Furthermore, observation, distribution of questionnaires for data collection and interviews to ensure data accuracy. We also make comparisons with applications that have similar concepts and features similar to our application. The research method used for the development of this application is waterfall that has five stages, requirements definition, system and software design, implementation and unit testing, integration and system testing and operation and maintenance. The results obtained from this writing show that the owner of the cat can feel the ease in detecting and knowing the disease from their cats who are sick, also getting knowledge on how to take care of cats in a good way. © 2019 ASTES Publishers.

This application is designed by using a Waterfall Model, a 5-phase model that is Communication, Planning, Modeling, Construction, and Deployment starting from as the aforementioned steps. Based on the responds we get from distributing questionnaire, many people didn't know how to exercise properly and didn't bother to check the calories of their food. Their weight is also a problem because most of them still have an Overweight or Underweight status. From those responds, we can conclude that our application will indeed help people to get and maintain their ideal body weight. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Food calorie; Ideal body weight; Waterfall model",,,,,,"Sparling, P.B., Howard, B.J., Dunstan, D.W., Owen, N., Recommendations for physical activity in older adults (2015) Bmj, 350, pp. h100-h100; Patki, S.M., Madhavi, P., Reddy, B.C., Madhavi, K.V.P., (2014) knowledge and attitude regarding dietary habits among secondary school children in khammam town, 3, pp. 3468-3475; Dixon, J.B., (2010) Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology The effect of obesity on health outcomes, 316, pp. 104-108; (2013), Singapore Management University; Digital Media in Indonesia; Nandkishor, B.R., Android Smartphone Based Body Area Network for Monitoring and Evaluation of Medical Parameters (2014) Architecture ABAN, pp. 284-288; Fling, B., (2009) Mobile Design and Development, , United State of America: O'Reilly Media; Safaat, N., (2014) Android: Pemrograman Aplikasi Mobile Smartphone Dan Tablet Pc Berbasis Android, , Bandung: INFORMATIKA; Connolly, T., Begg, C., (2015) Database Systems: A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation, and Management, , London: Pearson Education; Welling, L., Thomson, L., (2009) PHP and MySQL® Web Development, , United State of America: Addison-Wesley; Adams, E., (2014) Fundamentals of Game Design, , 3rd ed; Shneiderman, B., Plaisant, C., (2010) Designing the user interface: strategies for effective human-computer-interaction, , 5th ed.

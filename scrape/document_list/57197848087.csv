There are many factors that could be cause transportation accident, especially in vehicle's internal system problem. To overcome this problem, OBD-II technology has been created to diagnostics vehicle's condition. OBD-II scanner plugged to OBD-II port or usually called Data Link Connector (DLC), and after that it sends the diagnostics to Raspberry Pi. Compared from another microcontrollers, Arduino, Raspberry Pi are chosen because it sustains the application to receive real-time diagnostics, process the diagnostics and send command to automobiles at the same time, rather than Arduino that must wait for another process finished to run another process. Outcome from this application is to enable automobile's user to diagnostics their own vehicles. If there is found something unusual or a problem, the application can told the problem to user, so they could know what to fix before they use their vehicle safely. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Automobiles; Accident rate; Arduino; Data link; Internal systems; Raspberry pi; Real-time diagnostics; Accidents",,,,,"Graham, N.J., (2008) Wireless Automotive Data Link Connector, (B1). , US7584030; Nurfalah, M., (2014) Makalah Arduino Dan Raspberry Pi Mikrokontroler, p. 9; Monk, S., (2012) Programming Arduino Getting Started with Sketches, , (McGraw-Hill Education); Brandon, (2013) Arduino Uno Vs Raspberry Pi Vs BeagleBone Black MCM Electronics.

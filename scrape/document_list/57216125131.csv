Industry 4.0 provides new opportunities to improve the resource and process efficiencies by combining information and communication technologies such as autonomous robots, internet of things, cloud computing, big data, augmented reality, additive manufacturing, etc. This integrated cyber-physical production system raise complexity within production system that implies new competencies required for industrial engineers which has been proven for years that the role of industrial engineer greatly influences a manufacturing industry's success by designing, implementing, improving and optimizing a complex processes of an integrated systems that consist of people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy and materials. The competencies required in Industry 4.0 could be categorized under technical competencies and social competencies. A learning factory with real world system is often used to train students a new set of competencies by hands-on and direct experiences. Therefore, a learning factory can make a substantial contribution to competencies enhancement for industrial engineering students. This paper presents a conceptual of Industry 4.0 Lab as a learning factory for industrial engineering education as an enabler of students' competencies in industry 4.0 era. A fully automated small production of filling bottle system integrating and demonstrating various Industry 4.0 concepts technologies is chosen. The learning modules and didactic approach are developed by integrating industrial engineering body of knowledge, Industry 4.0 value drives and Industry 4.0 levers in the creation of technical and social competencies required. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","competencies; industrial engineering; Industry 4.0; learning factory","Augmented reality; Bottles; Competition; Data communication equipment; Digital storage; Engineers; Industrial engineering; Industry 4.0; Students; competencies; Conceptual development; Global competition; Information and Communication Technologies; Integrated systems; Learning factory; Manufacturing industries; Technical competencies; Engineering education",,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF","Initially, the learning factory was developed by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in America in 1994. The initial learning factory model was used to expand the knowledge gained by students or employees, where they will be confronted directly with real problems in the industry so that all processes and technology which is in the learning factory is based on reality. The model encourages students to be able to solve the problems given, one of them is by designing processes, productsand system according to their needs [27].","Plinta, D., New Information Technologies in Production Enterprises (2016) Advanced Industrial Engineering, pp. 7-20;

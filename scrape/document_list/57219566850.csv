One approach for quality control is to have a system that can classify coffee beans based on the quality. This system can assist the small-medium coffee enterprises to monitor and secure their procurement. However, the coffee beans quality classification technology is currently unavailable to the small-medium coffee enterprises community. To address this issue, we developed a mobile application powered by a deep-learning-based model to automatically classify coffee beans quality via a mobile phone camera. The deep learning model used is chosen between ResNet-152 and VGG16 based on their performance to classify coffee beans quality. The result shows that ResNet-152 could achieve the highest accuracy of 73.3% and could also be embedded in a functional mobile application. © 2020 IEEE.","Classification; Coffee; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Mobile information system","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Information management; International trade; Learning systems; Mobile computing; Coffee beans; Learning Based Models; Learning models; Mobile applications; Mobile information systems; Mobile phone cameras; Quality classification; World market; Classification (of information)",,,,,"Prabhakaran Nair, K.P., The agronomy and economy of important tree crops of the developing world (2010) Agron.

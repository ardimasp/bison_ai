The main issue in furniture industry is reducing environment pollution and industry waste. The objective of this study is ti apply and implement the green productivity methodology in furniture industry to carry out the environment and waste problems. The green productivity utilizes three tools, specifically material balance, eco-mapping and plant layout. Through the analysis results of material balance, the majority of production wastes were sawdust and a small piece of woods that cannot be exploited again. Instead of being burned, it will be preferable to be accumulated and sold it at the market. With eco-mapping analysis, it can be recognized about which area that produced the most substantial amount of wasted pieces. Hence, the remaining of sawdust will also be collected to be sold. After that, the proposal of the plant layout has been established with the consideration of production scheme and also the distance between all stations will be closer than before. The plant layout chosen is the first of proposed plant layout because it has the shortest production flow distance, which is 49,5m, which can intensify the efficiency of 160% from the original layout. Besides of the reduction industrial waste of this workshop, the company productivity is increased and obtained the additional income as a consequence of invaluable waste at first, to be processed to gain value-added. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Furniture; Green Productivity; Industry Environment","Mapping; Plant layout; Furniture; Furniture industry; Industry environment; Mapping analysis; Production flows; Production schemes; Production wastes; Reducing environment; Productivity",,,,,"Kemenperin, (2015) Industry Ministry Performance Report; Shirzad, M., Panahi, H.K.S., Dashti, B.B., Rajaeifar, M.A., Aghbashlo, M., Tabatabaei, M., A comprehensive review on electricity generation and GHG emission reduction potentials through anaerobic digestion of agricultural and livestock/slaughterhouse wastes in Iran (2019) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Review, 111, pp. 571-594; Fitton, N., Alexander, P., Arnell, N., Bajzelj, B., Calvin, K., Doelman, J., Gerber, J., Smith, P., The vulnerabilities of agricultural land and food production to future water scarcity (2019) Global Environmental Change, 58; Debbarma, S., Gd, Ransinchung, R.N., Singh, S., Sahdeo, S.K., Utilization of industrial and agricultural wastes for productions of sustainable roller compacted concrete pavement mixes containing reclaimed asphalt pavement aggregates (2020) Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 152; Chandrakumar, C., Gowrynathan, J., Kulatunga, A.K., Sanjeevan, N., Incorporate LEAN and Green Concepts to Enhance the Productivity of Transshipment Terminal Operations (2016) Procedia CIRP, 40, pp. 301-306; Wang, Y., Sun, X., Guo, X., Environmental regulation and green productivity growth: Empirical evidence on the Porter Hypothesis from OECD industrial sectors (2019) Energy Policy, 132, pp. 611-619; (2008) Green Productivity and Green Supply Chain Manual, , APO; (2010) An Approach to Sustainable Development, , APO; Gaspersz, V., Fontana, A., (2011) Systematic Countinuous Improvement and Innovation; Gasperz, V., Vontana, A., (2011) Organizational Excellence: Systematic Continuous Improvement and Innovation; Klausnitzer, A., Lasch, R., Optimal facility layout and material handling network design (2019) Computers & Operations Research, 103, pp. 237-251; Zha, S., Guo, Y., Huang, S., Wang, F., Huang, X., Robust Facility Layout Design under Uncertain Product Demands (2017) Procedia CIRP, 63, pp. 354-359",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

This research focuses on the problem to motivate employees to share their knowledge and use KMS. Bina Nusantara University in Indonesia becomes the object of the research since the university has implemented KM Portal system. Furthermore, the university has run the KM Award as the reward system. The research method of this study implements a Point Incentive System on the KM Portal for a year and compares the impact with the previous reward system. The reward system used were 1) KM Award System (2018) and 2) Point Incentive System (2019), each of which has been used for one year. This study focuses on comparing the two systems. The research applies quantitative research methodology to measure the number of user contributors and the number of contents in the system. When the numbers show an increase, then this is regarded as the indicator of success. The results show an increase in the number of user contributors by 34.92% and the number of contents by 68.85% stored on the KM Portal. This shows that the application of the KM Point Incentive System is more successful in promoting employees’ motivation to use KMS. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Content Based Image Retrieval System (CBIR) is a technique used for finding relevant images from those huge and unannotated image databases based on low-level features of the query images. In this study, an attempt to employ 2nd level Wavelet Based Color Histogram (WBCH) on a CBIR system is proposed. Image database used in this study are taken from Wang's image database containing 1000 color images. The experiment results show that 2nd level WBCH gives better precision (0.777) than the other methods, including 1st level WBCH, Color Histogram, Color Co-occurrence Matrix, and Wavelet texture feature. It can be concluded that the 2nd Level of WBCH can be applied to CBIR system. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","CBIR; Color Histogram; Wavelet",,,,,,,"Parvin, N., Kavitha, P., Content based image retrieval using feature extraction in jpeg domain and genetic algorithm (2017) Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 7 (1), pp. 226-233; Zukuan, W., Hongyeon, K., Youngkyun, K., Jaehong, K., An efficient content based image retrieval scheme (2013) Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 11 (11), pp. 6986-6991; Rao, N.G., Kumar, V.V., Krishna, V.V., Texture based image indexing and retrieval (2009) IJCSNS International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, 9 (5), pp. 206-210; Swain, M.J., Ballard, D.H., Color indexing (1991) International journal of computer vision, 7 (1), pp. 11-32; Han, X.-H., Chen, Y.-W., Imageclef 2010 modality classification in medical image retrieval: Multiple feature fusion with normalized kernel function (2010) CLEF (Notebook Papers/LABs/Workshops); Tamura, H., Mori, S., Yamawaki, T., Textural features corresponding to visual perception (1978) IEEE Transactions on Systems, man, and cybernetics, 8 (6), pp. 460-473; Youness, C., Mohammed, O., Brahim, A., New method of content based image retrieval based on 2-d esprit method and the gabor filters (2015) Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 15 (2), pp. 313-320; Irianto, S.Y., Segmentation for image indexing and retrieval on discrete cosines domain (2013) TELKOMNIKA (Telecommunication Computing Electronics and Control), 11 (1), pp. 119-126; Lin, C.-H., Chen, R.-T., Chan, Y.-K., A smart content-based image retrieval system based on color and texture feature (2009) Image and Vision Computing, 27 (6), pp. 658-665; Raghupathi, G., Anand, R., Dewal, M., Color and texture features for content based image retrieval (2010) Second International conference on multimedia and content based image retrieval, 3, pp. 39-57; Hiremath, P., Pujari, J., Content based image retrieval using color, texture and shape features (2007) Advanced Computing and Communications, 2007, pp. 780-784. , ADCOM 2007.

In terms of income, there was also a decline in growth because legacy services (voice & SMS) tended to decline due to threats from OTT. Therefore, a strategy is needed to survive this condition, one of which is to look at the digital market. The digital service business development strategy is carried out to be able to increase the company's revenue through the implementation of Machine to Machine (M2M) services given the promising potential and support of the digital ecosystem. But in reality, the implementation of digital services has not been able to have a significant impact on the company's revenue growth so that a new strategy is needed with a service innovation. This study aims to model M2M digital services into the Smart Connected Motorbike (SCM) service, as well as analyze the service delivery business model in the PT. XYZ so that it is expected to become a new source of income for cellular operators of PT. XYZ. Furthermore, this research will do investment analysis in machine to machine application. Moreover, this research also indicated that this implementation is also feasible to increase the company's earnings. © 2018 IEEE.","Investment analysis; Machine to machine application; Revenue; Smart connected motorbike",,,,,,"(2014) Cellular M2M Forecasts and Assumptions: 2010-2020; (2014) Data Statistik Transportasi Darat, , Badan Pusat Statistik; Boswarthick, D., Elloumi, O., Hersent, O., (2012) M2M Communications: A Systems Approach, , John Wiley & Sons Ltd; Kechiche, S., (2014) Cellular M2M Forecasts and Assumptions: 2010-2020, , https://gsmaintelligence.com/research/2014/09/cellular-m2m-forecasts-and-assumptions-2010-2020/446/, September 23, Retrieved from GSMA Intelligence; (2015) Digital Service Revenue Report, , PT.

Revenue growth is also declined because legacy services are tend to decreased due to threat from OTTs. Therefore we need a strategy to be able to withstand these conditions, one of which is a glance at the digital market. Strategy to offer digital services is developed in order to increase operators' revenue through offering of Machine to Machine (M2M) services, where potential and digital ecosystem support of those services is promising. In reality, implementation of those digital services is not yielding significant effect on operators' revenue growth, thus they need new strategy with a new service innovation. This research aims to modeling an M2M services, into a Smart Connected Motorbike (SCM) services. Furthermore, this research also analyzes business model implementation of this service as a study case at PT.XYZ, where this service is expected to become a new revenue source. From system modeling result and business model analysis, it is revealed that implementation of Smart Connected Motorbike services practices multi-sided platform business model pattern that brings together two different groups of customers which are motorbike users/buyers and corporate customers. Moreover, this research analyses four business models approach to find appropriate implementation models of Smart Connected Motorbike services and additional revenue opportunities for PT.XYZ. © 2016 IEEE.","M2M; mobile operator; multi-sided platform business model; smart connected motorbike","Information services; Corporate customers; Engineering economic analysis; Implementation models; Machine to machines; Machine-to-machine (M2M); Mobile operators; Multi-sided platforms; smart connected motorbike; Economic analysis",,,,,"(2015) Annual Report PT, , XYZ.

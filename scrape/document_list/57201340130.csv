In this study, the researcher used the e-service quality and NFC indicator models from previous studies to determine the importance of using NFC Mobile Payment in Indonesia. The researcher distributed 207 questionnaires using technique-random samples and received 100 valid data with the questionnaire distribution period from October 21 to December 15, 2018. Data and analysis processing in the study used the SEM-PLS method (structural comparison model partially smallest square) using smartPLS statistical software. This study showed that e-service quality influences the perceived usefulness, the perceived usefulness influences intention to use, NFC indicators influence the perceived usefulness and NFC indicators influence the perceived the ease of use. © 2019 IEEE.","e-service quality; mobile payment; NFC indicators; NFC technology; SEM-PLS; TAM","Data handling; Electronic money; Global system for mobile communications; Information management; Quality control; Quality of service; Surveys; E-service quality; Intention to use; Mobile payment; Nfc technologies; Perceived usefulness; Random sample; Statistical software; Structural comparison; Near field communication",,,,,"Jaya, I.G.N.M., Sumertajaya, I.M., Pemodelan persamaan struktural dengan partial least square (2008) Seminar Nasional Matematika Dan Pendidikan Matematika, , Indonesia; Wijaya, K.K., (2016) Kumpulan Layanan Berikut Ini Memungkinkan Kamu Untuk Bertransaksi Dengan Smartphone, , https://id.teChinasia.com/daftar-layananpembayaran-mobile-Indonesia, 29 Mar.

The high rate of mobile devices usage in Indonesia make many companies take advantage of this device as a media in electronic payment transactions, a lot of banking and financial product in Indonesia used this technology such as E-money, T-cash, Flazz, Ooredoo, Dompetku, XL-Tunaiku, Doku Wallet, Skye card, Artajasa MYNT and many more. The technique that used in this research to prove the hypotheses was Structural Equation Model (SEM) using Smart PLS software, we will used questionnaire and literature review method to found trend of NFC use. The population from which to draw conclusion was defined as all individual capable use NFC Technology for payment transaction. In this study, we will investigate NFC use in Indonesia, The proposed research model was develop by TAM Framework with some dimension from NFC study literature that is Mobile Payment Knowledge, Technology, Trust, Behaviour and Compatibility into the model, in order to determine the significant factor that influence of NFC use in Indonesia. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Digital wallet; Instant payment; NFC; PLS; SEM; TAM model",,,,,,"Ketel, M., Shumate, T., Bring Your Own Device?

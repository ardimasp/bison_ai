Some of this challenges would come from large amount of images that needs to be analyzed along side with a typical natural image noise sea environment could impose. To automate the recognition process, image information systems needed to be implemented in such cases. Most of these processes involve recognizing an object in a scene, whether the object possesses similar characteristics to the reference image. There are many methods that can be applied to the schema. One of them is computer vision technique, which enables the systems to automatically identify objects within a given image samples. This work compares the implementation of such method on aerial images for sea environment monitoring system. Two of the most promising methods are SURF and SIFT. They both work similarly as descriptor which involve application of integral image, where storing information inside descriptors enable users to describe images that is needed for matching. In open sea scenario, it is important to be able to recognize objects from higher altitude from any view point, therefore this paper will be focusing more on evaluating descriptor and matching methods toward aerial images through detected key points and detected matching points. This work as well will conclude which of the methods are best to be implemented on analyzing object in sea environment samples based on the evaluation criteria. © 2018 IEEE.","Aerial images; SIFT; SURF; vessel monitoring systems","Antennas; Information management; Monitoring; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Aerial images; Computer vision techniques; Evaluation criteria; Recognition process; Sea environments; SIFT; SURF; Vessel monitoring systems; Image processing",,,,,"Kourti, N., Sheperd, I., Greidanus, H., Alvarez, M., Aresu, E., Bauna, T., Chesworth, J., Schwartz, G., Integrating remote sensing in fisheries control (2005) Fisheries Management and Ecology, 12 (5), pp. 295-307; Lee, J., South, A.B., Jennings, S., Developing reliable, repeatable, and accessible methods to provide high-resolution estimates of fishing-effort distributions from vessel monitoring system (VMS) data (2010) ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67 (6), pp. 1260-1271; Palmer, M.C., Wigley, S.E., Using positional data from vessel monitoring systems to validate the logbook-reported area fished and the stock allocation of commercial fisheries landings (2011) North American Journal of Fisheries Management 2009, 29 (4), pp. 928-942; Anderson, K., Gaston, K.J., Lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles will revolutionize spatial ecology (2013) The Ecological Society of America, 11 (3), pp. 138-146; Jiang, L., Analysis of military-civilian integration influence factor for Chinese unmanned aerial vehicle industry (2015) International Conference on Management Engineering and Management Innovation (ICMEMI), Harbin; Song Xia, G., Hu, J., Hu, F., Shi, B., Bai, X., Zhong, Y., Zhang, L., Aid: A benchmark dataset for performance evaluation of aerial scene classification (2017) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 55 (7), pp. 3965-3981; Tang, T., Zhou, S., Deng, Z., Zou, H., Lei, L., Vehicle detection in aerial images based on region convolutional neural networks and hard negative example mining (2017) Sensors, 336; Zhai, M., Bessinger, Z., Workman, S., Predicting ground-level scene layout from aerial imagery (2017) IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR); Soria, P.R., Arrue, B.C., (2017) Etection, Location and Grasping Objects Using A Stereo Sensor on UAV in Outdoor Environments; Bay, H., Ess, A., Tuytelaars, T., Gool, L.V., Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) (2007) Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 110 (3), pp. 346-359; Marques, J.S., Bernardino, A., Cruz, G., Bento, M., An algorithm for the detection of vessels in aerial images (2014) Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance (AVSS), 11th IEEE International Conference; Panchal, P.M., Panchal, S.R., Shah, S.K., A comparison of SIFT and SURF (2013) International Journal of Innovative Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 1 (2), p. 326; Valgren, C., Lilienthal, A.J., Sift, surf & seasons: Appearancebased long-Term localization in outdoor environments (2010) Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 58 (2), pp. 149-156; Huo, C., Pan, C., Huo, L., Zhou, Z., Multilevel sift matching for large-size vhr image registration (2012) IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 9 (2), pp. 171-175; Madbouly, A.M.M., Wafy, M., Mostafa, M., Performance assessment of feature detector-descriptor combination (2015) IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, 12 (5), pp. 87-92; Khan, N.Y., McCane, B., Wyvill, G., Sift and surf performance evaluation against various image deformations on benchmark dataset (2011) International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications, pp. 501-506; Panchal, P.M., Panchal, S.R., Shah, S.K., (2013) Comparison of SIFT and SURFi Nternational Journal of Innovative Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 1 (2), pp. 323-327",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2018","3 September 2018 through 5 September 2018",,142373,,9781538658215,,,"English","Proc.

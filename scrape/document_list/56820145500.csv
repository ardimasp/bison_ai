For this reason, it is important to know what would be the factors that affect such price. The objective of the study then is to find such factor or variables, while it is significantly related to the stock price, it also have to be easily acquired. We begun by presuming that crude oil price and exchange rate–tax rate were of such factors. The results indicated indeed crude oil price positively affects stock price with a magnitude of 14.85 points. Similarly, exchange rata also positively affecting stock price with magnitude of 0.27 points. As such it is they are important factors to consider in predicting stock price of the Oil Company and hence important indicators for investors to be considered in making decision to buy or not to buy. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

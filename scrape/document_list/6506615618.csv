Educators and institutions are unsure which digital content is the most appropriate to improve a student’s skills. For this study, an experimental design method using a control-group pretest-posttest was conducted to compare learning outcomes through the implementation of digital content in blended learning for computer programming. The instrument used was a programming case. The factor and level tested included various digital content types, and the desired response was an increment in learning outcomes. This study concludes that there is a significant increment in the average scores of groups that are using Ebooks in blended learning—not video as many educators may think. Results of this study include a recommendation for educators and institutions in applying and determining which digital content is the most appropriate to improve students’ programming skills in blended learning. © Common Ground Research Networks, Budi Yulianto, Harjanto Prabowo, Raymond Kosala, Ford Lumban Gaol, All Rights Reserved.

Learning materials are mostly available in form of book and anatomy mannequin (puppet), but it is still insufficient enough to help students in understanding human body anatomy. Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that combines a real thing into virtual environment interactively. This research purpose is to develop an AR application for human body anatomy learning to be more interesting and easier for student to understand. This application enables student to learn human body anatomy with 3D object interaction while previously using textbook and mannequin. Research method in for this study is by using quantitative method that collects data and then develops the prototype to prove the impact. Application development method is done by using waterfall method that includes planning (collect data and analysis), design (user interface and diagram), implementation, and testing.

One of the difficulties is to transform algorithm in mind into syntactical solution (sourcecode). This study proposes an application to help students in transform their algorithm (logic) into sourcecode. The proposed application can be used to write down students' algorithm (logic) as block of pseudocode and then transform it into selected programming language sourcecode. Students can learn and modify the sourcecode and then try to execute it (learning by doing). Proposed application can improve 17% score and 14% passing rate of novice programmers (new students) in learning programming. © 2018 Budi Yulianto, Harjanto Prabowo, Raymond Kosala and Manik Hapsara.","Algorithm; Novice programmer; Programming language; Pseudocode",,,,,"Binus University

To prevent high non-passing rate, instructor needs to know which learner has the potential to pass the course or not. Learner who will fail the course also need advices immediately from instructor or system to overcome it. Learning Analytics (LA) is needed to collect and analyze learners' activity logs on MOOC and predict their passing potential. The prototype application is developed by using Rational Unified Process (RUP) software development method. Implementation of LA in MOOC is feasible and suggested to analyze learners' success factors by consuming learners' activity logs and visualizing it in scatter diagram and node-link diagram. Instructor can provide advices to learners based on success factors generated by LA. © 2018 Budi Yulianto, Harjanto Prabowo, Raymond Kosala and Manik Hapsara.","Learner success factor; Learning analytics; MOOC",,,,,"Binus University

For teachers, authoring tool is a solution that can help them in designing materials with interactive video. For students, interactive learning materials will certainly increase interest and understanding of the material. Goal of this research is to build an authoring tool for producing interactive video to be run on the browser. The methodology used was the RUP (Rational Unified Process) which consists of Inception, Elaboration, Construction, and Transition phases. Result of this study is an authoring tool application for designing and producing interactive video and generating it to HTML5 platform. Conclusions obtained are the authoring tool can help teachers to design teaching materials in the form of interactive video, and use it in teaching and learning process to increase students understanding of material. © 2017 The Authors.

As implemented in the cloud, Web IDE (WIDE) can be accessed online through browsers and on mobile devices. WIDE takes many advantages and becomes popular in recently years. Unfortunately, there is no tool found yet in currently WIDE to support translating novice programmers' algorithm into programming language before they become experts in techniques of writing computer programs. This study goal is to design a tool to support novice programmers' early learning of programming before they step into coding, compiling, running, and debugging in WIDE. Software development method used in this study is Rational Unified Process (RUP). Conclusion of this study is block-code tool can help novice programmers to learn programming language in early phase, and motivate them better. © 2017 The Authors.

Experimental design method using control-group pretest-posttest is conducted to compare digital contents effectiveness of learning outcomes in computer programming field for self-learning students. The instrument used is a programming case, with factor and level to be tested is various digital content types, and desired response is learning outcomes increment. This study concludes that there is an average increment of learning outcomes by using various digital contents for self-learning, but still lower average increment compared with traditional classroom method.

As AI becomes more advanced and interaction between human and robot becomes more personal, sex and marriage with robot could result in the future. The authors conducted survey to discuss current and future trend of sex robot, its advantages and disadvantages. This paper also presents falsification theorems and implications to business, human social, moral, and psychological life caused by sex robot. This paper closes the discussion with further works of important ethical issues to be considered with deontology or consequentialism, and suggests to concern of sex robot regulations rather than banning it. © Copyright 2015, IGI Global.","Artificial Intelligence; Consequentialism; Deontology; Human Ethics; Robot; Sex; Sex Robot",,,,,,,"Amuda, Y.J., Tijani, I.B., Ethical and Legal Implications of Sex Robot: An Islamic Perspective (2012) OIDA International Journal of Sustainable Development, 3 (6), pp. 19-28; Bates, D., (2012) Sex Machines: How Robotic Prostitutes Could Turn A Crime-ridden Industry into A Respectable Guilt Free Business, , http://www.victoria.ac.nz/som/about/publications/Newsletter-June-2012.pdf, School of Management Newsletter, Victoria University, June; Bendel, O., Surgical, therapeutic, nursing and sex robots in machine and Information Ethics (2015) Machine Medical Ethics, ISCASE, 74, pp. 17-32. , S.P. van Rysewyk, &M.

The use of whiteboard and marker while teaching is an essential media for delivering knowledge from a lecturer to students. In another side, it can cost in daily operation such as making marker dried because of capped-off, easily smudged and some whiteboard (for projector screen) is difficult to be clean if written. The objective is to design and develop an interactive whiteboard application based on multimedia concept to support effective and interactive learning process in classroom. The system is connected to a WiiMote device via Bluetooth and a projector. The methodology is literature study, observation and system design using Unified Modeling Language (UML) approach. An application that can capture image, record sound and video while teaching process. The system is tested and focused on main teaching activities such as writing (drawing), erasing, capturing and recording. All these functionalities can run very well, but need several improvement for next version. © 2014 Science Publications.","Classroom; InfraRed LED marker; Interactive whiteboard; Multimedia; Teaching and learning; UML; WiiMote",,,,,,,"Booch, G., Rumbaugh, J., Jacobson, I., (2005) The Unified Modeling Language User Guide, p. 496. , 1st Edn.

Multimedia technology that has video and audio streaming element takes an important role in interactive teaching activities between teachers and students. Streaming or transmission of video and audio has bandwidth, delay and loss packet. The objective is to design and develop an interactive multimedia system for language classroom to facilitate learning activities. The system is connected through LAN network used combination of TCP, UDP and RSTP connection to cover optimal bandwidth, delay and loss packet. The methodology is literature study, observation and system design using Unified Modeling Language (UML) approach. Automated and interactive learning activity using multimedia streaming technology. The system is tested and its main functionality is only focusing on Class Speech, Personal Speech, Share Desktop and Share Video. All these functionality can run very well, but need several improvement for next version. © 2013 Science Publications.","Language classroom; Multimedia; RSTP; TCP; UDP; Unified modeling language (UML); Video and audio streaming",,,,,,,"Din, I.U.D., Mahfooz, S., Adnan, M., Performance improvement of UDP and TCP traffic by CJM algorithm in voice transmission (2010) Global J.

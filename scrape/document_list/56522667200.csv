This alternative arises due to many of the systems, which developed mostly by using microcontroller are not giving any room for customization to increase its performance or I/O ports. There is any possibility that the system designed to be used by using general processor such as PC to increase its performance but it will give another problem such as interface difficulty for high speed I/O, real time processing, increases complexity, and many more. Customization is introduced by combining hard IP processor and FPGA in one chip instead of practicing two separate devices, processor and FPGA, which is commonly use in high performance embedded design. This approach allows seamless design development and development time reduction for customization.","Customization; Embedded system; FPGA; Microcontroller; System-on-chip","Controllers; Embedded systems; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Microcontrollers; System-on-chip; As interfaces; Customization; Development time; Embedded designs; High speed I/O; Realtime processing; Seamless design; Separate devices; Integrated circuit design",,,,,"Bohr, M., Mistry, K., (2011) ""Intel's revolutionary 22 nm transistor technology"", , Intel website; Smith, M.J., (1997) ""Application-specific integrated circuits""; Yiannacouras, P., Steffan, J.G., Rose, J., ""Application-specific customization of soft processor microarchitecture"" (2006) Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/SIGDA 14th international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays.

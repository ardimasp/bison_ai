There are variety and different organization for support the integration mechanism. We proposed the concept of implementation about travel reservation solution that called To-Tour for use by travellers using on Service Oriented Analysis and Design Approach, specifically in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). To-Tour is a Tour Travel Agency offering any trips from different vendor, and provide any variety features such as hotel, restaurant, car & motorcycle rent, trip destination, tour package, tour guide, merchandise, train, flight and the other feature in one platform application. Service Oriented Analysis and Design can combine any entities from different providers that can be integrated together to provide Smart Travel System services for travellers. To-Tour system is also designed to develop the tourism industries in Indonesia could appealing to any different travels segments. To-Tour is a new way to reservation any services for travel on one application. Smart Travel System is solution in Indonesia, the travellers can search various travels or other services in our application. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Information services; Design approaches; Integration mechanisms; Service Oriented; System services; Tour guide; Tourism industry; Travel agency; Travel reservations; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,"Svanidzaite, Sandra, A Comparison of SOA Methodologies Analysis & Design Phases Databases and Information Systems BalticDB&IS, 2012, p. 202; Fareghzadeh, Nafise, Service identification approach to SOA development (2008) - Proceedings of World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, 35; Erl, T., (2005) Service Oriented Architecture: Concept, Technology, and Design, , (Prentice Hall); Adipradana, B., (2008) Penerapan Business Process Management Dalam Service-Oriented Architecture, , (Institut Teknologi Bandung); Rosen, M., Lublinsky, B., Smith, K.T., (2008) Applied SOA, , (Indianapolis: Wiley Publishing, Inc); Peraturan Presiden Republik Indonesia Nomor 49 Tahun 2016.

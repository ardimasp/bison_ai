The Economic dispatch problem is aim to distribute electrical power generators in some active electrical system to minimize the total of cost of generators. Here, the purpose of this paper is to achieve the combination of power output, maximum total of demand with the transmission losses, minimum the total cost of generating unit and design web based application to simplify the calculation of economic dispatch problem for user at PT. Indonesia Power. This paper introduces a solution to ED problem using Dr. Xin She Yang developed firefly algorithm. The result obtained by the proposed algorithm have been compared with the result from the data source and that results is more optimal using firefly algorithm than the results of the data source. Based on the result, it can be concluded that this web based application is very useful to user in calculating the economic dispatch problem with transmission losses at PT.

This created a rising demand on social media marketing. New breakthroughs in the field of artificial intelligence have enabled brand owners to boost social media marketing by knowing their target's demography. This study presents a model to predict gender of social media users based on comments section on Instagram profile by using AdaBoost, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes Classifier combined with a grid search and K- Fold validation. The model was trained with 40,000 comments and managed to get 78.64% on Naive Bayes, 73.41% on XGBoost, 74.56% on AdaBoost and 76.07% on SVM which are generally higher than related studies on this subject. This result shows that Naive Bayes produces higher accuracy on short text classification and has possibilities to help social media marketing. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

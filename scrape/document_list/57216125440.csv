Our activity in this research is conduct training using a dataset that we created ourselves and do traffic recording simulation in a lot of scenario using YOLO original datasets and our own datasets. The result of this research is YOLO algorithm successfully detects vehicles as much as 65.3% of the total vehicles passing on the highway and gives the wrong label as much as 20.7% of the total label given if using YOLO original dataset. YOLO algorithm successfully detects vehicles as much as 9,3% of the total vehicles passing on the highway and gives the wrong label as much as 7,4% of the total label given if using our own dataset. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Computer Vision; Deep Learning; YOLO","Computer vision; Deep learning; Algorithm accuracies; Number of vehicles; YOLO; Road vehicles",,,,,"(2017) Survei Uber: Warga Jakarta Kena Macet 90 Menit Setiap Hari, , http://katadata.co.id/berita/2017/11/01/survei-uber-warga-jakarta-kena-macet-90-menit-setiap-hari, Katadata Accessed from Katadata; (2017) KedaiKOPI: Ini Respon Publik Jakarta Tentang Ganjil Genap Dan Rencana ERP, , http://kedaikopi.co/web/index.php/survei/37-kedaikopi-ini-respon-publik-jakarta-tentang-ganjil-genap-dan-rencana-erp, KedaiKOPI Accessed from KedaiKOPI; Smith, S., (2016) IEEE Spectrum Accessed from Pittsburgh's AI Traffic Signals Will Make Driving Less Boring, , https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/robotics/artificial-intelligence/pittsburgh-smart-traffic-signals-will-make-driving-less-boring; Younes, M.B., Boukerche, A., An Intelligent Traffic Light scheduling algorithm through VANETs (2014) 39th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks Workshops, pp. 637-646; Eze, E.C., Zhang, S., Liu, E., Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs): Current state, challenges, potentials and way forward (2014) 2014 20th International Conference on Automation and Computing, pp. 176-186; Lazaro, A., (2017) Deteksi Jenis Kendaraan di Jalan Menggunakan OpenCV, pp. 1-6; Redmon, J., Farhadi, A., (2016) YOLO9000: Better, Faster, Stronger, pp. 1-9; Foley, K., Frick, J., Moccia, V., Patel, S., Wheatley, K., (2017) AI City Challenge Object Detection Using YOLO, pp. 1-5; Serrano, A.S., (2017) YOLO Object Detector for Onboard Driving Images, pp. 1-11","Tan, S.; Computer Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: sofyan@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

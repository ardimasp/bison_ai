On the other hand, the public oftentimes is surprised to get their position as a victim in doing something that is common in cyber space. Discrepancy between public perspective and law perspective created tension between the public and law enforcement. Gap of understanding within cyber space concept is because sometimes the law is difficult to catch the dynamic phenomenon in cyber space that shifts in very fast way with many convergence concepts. By the convergency principle in cyber space, this paper tries to discuss from the science of communication. In digital media, communication role is very important, because in cyber space of the backbone concept is communication, and one of the concepts of digital communication is digital proxemics that will be explored with literature review method. This paper found that proxemics concept can determine the scope of personal data protection from privacy and the distribution of information. © 2021 ICIC International","Cyber law; Cyber space; Cybercrime; Digital communication; Digital media; Digital proxemics",,,,,,,"Das, S., Nayak, T., Impact of cyber crime: Issues and challenges (2013) Int.

The empirical study found that the presence of non-cash payment instruments using cards can replace the role of cash payment instruments in economist transactions in Indonesia. The growth of electronic money when viewed on a monthly basis is much faster than the growth of debit and credit card cards, a monthly increase of electronic money can reach 70% -100%, while debit and credit card cards only grow in the range of 20%. This study aims to analyze the design of e-money, as well as provide some development ideas that must be done related to the implementation of e-money. © 2018 IEEE.","business strategy; cashless payment; e-money; electronic banking; fintech; strategic planning; the blockchain","Pattern recognition; Strategic planning; Business strategy; Cash payments; cashless payment; Credit cards; Electronic banking; Empirical studies; fintech; Payment instrument; Electronic money",,,,,"Uddin, Salah, M., Yesmin, A., Akhi, E-wallet system for Bangladesh an electronic payment system (2014) International Journal of Modeling and Optimization, 4 (3). , June 2014; O'Sullivan, A., Sheffrin, S.M., Economics: Principles in action (2003) Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458: Pearson Prentice Hall, p. 261; Taylor, S., Todd, P.A., Understanding information technology usage: A test of competing models (1995) Information Systems Research, 6 (2), pp. 144-176; (2014) News Letter Bank Indonesia, Gerai Info BI No50.

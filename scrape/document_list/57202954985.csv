Internet of Things, is one of the concepts of technology that seeks the integration between these devices. IoT can be used in many fields, for example for smart cities, industrial, medical, and one of the biggest is its use in the home. One example of implementing IoT on smart home is its application to control household appliances, such as air conditioners, light, TVs, and others. From the results of further research, a smart socket with mobile application was developed that can help people to be able to control electronical devices at home. Smart socket designed using Arduino microcontroller. The system created allows users to control the devices for each socket, doesn't control for one power strip. With this system, it can reduce exccessive use of electricity as a result forgot to shut down. © 2019 The Authors.

Keyboard Dynamics is one of the solution to perform password authentication without adding any tools which being disruptive to some users. The biometric keystroke dynamic system is relatively unexplored compared to other behavioral authentications discipline. Coupled with the limited number of studies that have been done compared with other biometric systems. Several machine learning research has been conducted but few of them applying deep learning for solving this problem. This research will be focusing in deep learning using optimizer to beat the previous research which using another machine learning techniques. This research shows a better result using optimizer in deep learning resulting in 92.60% accuracy. © 2018 The Authors.

Generally, the heuristic algorithm will take the high computation time to solve optimization problem. Likewise, ABC also consumes too much time to solve clustering problem. This paper intends solving clustering problem using ABC with focusing reduction computation time called FABCC. This idea proposes detecting the pattern of redundant process then compacting it to effective process to diminish the computation process. There are five data sets to be used to prove the performance of FABCC. The results shows that FABCC is effective to prune the duration process up to 46.58 %. © 2018 Slovene Society Informatika.

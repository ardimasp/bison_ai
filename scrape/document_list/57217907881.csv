It exhibits antioxidant activities mainly due to phytochemicals known as isoflavones. Since tempeh is mainly consumed cooked, this study investigated the influences of steaming process at three different times (10 min, 30 min and 60 min) on the antioxidant activities of tempeh. While a subtle decrease in antioxidant activities was observed in tempeh aqueous extracts, tempeh ethanol extracts did not differ in antioxidant activities. The results suggested that steaming process, even when applied for an hour, caused very minimal decrease in tempeh antioxidant activities. Such a decrease was particularly observed in the water-soluble fraction but not in the ethanol-soluble fraction. Therefore, steaming could be opted as a good cooking method for tempeh to keep its antioxidant-related health benefits. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","antioxidant; isoflavone; soybean;

It exerts antioxidant activities mainly due to the presence of bioactive compounds known as isoflavones. We previously observed that tempeh ethanol extract increased the basal expression of some cellular antioxidant enzymes including catalase and superoxide dismutases in HepG2 cells in vitro. In this study, we showed that pretreament with tempeh extract protected HepG2 cells from oxidative stress triggered by TBHP (tert-butyl hydroperoxide) by reducing cellular ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation, TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive species) levels, caspase-3 activity and eventually cell death. We hypothesize that the resistance of cells pretreated with tempeh extract towards the toxicity of TBHP was in part due to the upregulation of cellular antioxidant enzymes. Taken together, our findings highlight the antioxidative potentials of tempeh, particularly in an attempt to develop tempeh as a functional food offering health-related benefits to humans. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","antioxidant;

The antioxidant inhibits the oxidative damage by free radicals through several mechanisms. The sources of the antioxidant are abundantly available in nature and can be found in the daily diet such as fruit, vegetables, seeds, nuts, leaves, roots, and barks. Several major compounds identified as antioxidants such as polyphenols, vitamins, and carotenoids. This article provides ageneral summary of the most common in vitromethods for determining antioxidant activity. It emphasizes the working principle, methodology, advantages, and disadvantages of different methods. The determination of antioxidant activity could not only follow one single approach due to the diversity of antioxidant mode of actions. Therefore, the choices of the appropriate method of analysis need to be considered to achieve the purpose of the research. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Free radicals; Anti-oxidant activities; In-vitro; Method of analysis; Mode of action; Oxidative damage; Polyphenols; Antioxidants",,,,,,"Grosso, G., Dietary antioxidants and prevention of non-communicable diseases (2018) Antioxidants (Basel), 7, pp. 1-3; Engelgau, M.M., Rosenthal, J.P., Newsome, B.J., Price, L., Belis, D., Mensah, G.A., Non communicable diseases in low- and middle-income countries: A strategic approach to develop a global implementation research workforce (2018) Glob.

Raw milk also provides almost ideal media for various microorganisms to grow rapidly that can harm human digestion, or make damages the milk itself. In attempt to investigate an appropriate processing technology as an alternative of thermal pasteurization, we developed non thermal corona discharge to eliminate total number of various microorganisms in milk. The generated corona discharge used 7 pins to plate surface configuration. With a distance 15 mm between the electrodes, the applied voltage of 6.48 kV by a homemade high voltage AC power supply yields in corona discharge that has temperature lower than 30°C after 8 minutes operation. The time dependent effects of the implementation of this discharge to raw milk were carried out at time interval 2, 4 and 8 minutes. It was found that there was three different types of bacteria colony morphology in the microorganism population of raw milk. The microorganism counts were decrease for 2 and 4 min corona treatments. However, when the corona treatment was done in 8 min, the total number of microorganism increased significantly. Although the corona discharge shows the potential benefits in milk decontamination processing at low temperature, more detailed study should be carried out to confirm the suitable in real application including the nutrient composition before and after treatment. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","corona discharge; microorganism population; Non-thermal plasma; raw milk","Electric corona; Microorganisms; Morphology; Nutrients; Temperature; Bacteria colonies; Corona discharges; Nonthermal plasma; Nutrient composition; Potential benefits; Processing technologies; Raw milk; Time-dependent effects; Electric discharges",,,,"12/AKM/PNT/2019, 225/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019, 039/VR","The authors would like to acknowledge Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia for the financial support, according to contract number: 225/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019, 12/AKM/PNT/2019, 039/VR.RTT/IV/2019.","Eniza, S., Dasar pengolahan susu dan hasil ikutan ternak (2004) USU Digital Library, pp. 1-31; Muchamad Saiful, R., Enny, S., Suprihana, The effect of time and temperature sterilization on the cow milk chocolate flavour (2016) Jurnal Ilmu-ilmu Pertanian ""agrika"", 10, pp. 20-30; Ilbilge, S., Eren, N., Ali, T., Proteolysis and storage stability of UHT milk produced in Turkey (2006) International Dairy Journal, 16 (6), pp. 633-638; Harley, J., Hilton, D., (2007) Scientific Evaluation of Pasteurisation for Pathogen Pasteurisation for Pathogen Products; Novita Dewi, K., The effect of pasteurization milk storage to quality Microbe Thermoduric and chemical properties (2017) Jurnal Ilmu Dan Teknologi Hasil Ternak, 12 (1), pp. 1-7; Tri Yuni, H., Suratmin, U., Optimasi suhu dan waktu sterilisasi pada kualitas susu segar di kabupaten Boyolali (2017) Jurnal Teknologi, 9 (2), pp. 97-101; Tuhu Agung, R., Hanry Sutan, W., Pengolahan air limbah industri tahu dengan menggunakan teknologi plasma (2011) Jurnal Ilmu Teknik Lingkungan, 2, pp. 19-28; Muhammad, N., (2011) Fisika Plasma Dan Aplikasinya; Gurol, C., Ekinci, F.Y., Aslan, N., Korachi, M., Low Temperature Plasma for decontamination of E.

However, their antimicrobial potential has been poorly studied by modern laboratory methods. Objective: This study investigates in vitro antimicrobial activity of 49 ethanol extracts from 37 plant species used in Indonesian traditional medicine for treatment against Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Materials and methods: The plants were collected from the Biopharmaca collection garden, Bogor, Indonesia. The plant material was dried, finely grounded, extracted using ethanol, concentrated, and the dried residue was dissolved in 100% DMSO. Antimicrobial activity was determined in terms of a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using a broth microdilution method in 96-well microplates. Results: The extract of Orthosiphon aristatus (Blume) Miq. (Lamiaceae) leaf produced the strongest antimicrobial effect, inhibiting the growth of C. albicans (MIC 128 lg/mL), S. aureus (MIC 256 lg/mL), E. faecalis (MIC 256 lg/mL) and P. aeruginosa (MIC 256 lg/mL). The leaf extract of Woodfordia floribunda Salisb. (Lythraceae) also exhibited significant effect against C. albicans (MIC 128 lg/mL), S. aureus (MIC 256 lg/mL) and E. faecalis (MIC 256 lg/mL). Rotheca serrata (L.) Steane & Mabb. (Lamiaceae) leaf extract inhibited the growth of S. aureus (MIC 256 µg/mL) and C. albicans (MIC 256 µg/mL). Discussion and conclusions: The leaf extract of O. aristatus and W. floribunda exhibited a significant anti-candidal effect. Therefore, both of these plants can serve as prospective source materials for the development of new anti-candidal agents. © 2018 The Author(s).","Anti-candidal; Antibacterial; Orthosiphon aristatus; Rotheca serrata; Woodfordia floribunda","Aerva sanguinolenta extract; Agathis macrophylla extract; alcohol; Aleurites moluccanus extract; Amomum compactum extract; Amorphophallus muelleri extract; antifungal agent; antiinfective agent; Barleria prionitis extract; Bryophyllum pinnatum extract; Clerodendrum extract; Curcuma mangga Valeton extract; Dracaena angustifolia extract; Eleutherine bulbosa extract; Evodia hortensis extract; Fibraurea tinctoria extract; Gardenia jasminioides extract; Ipomoea quamoclit extract; Ixora paludosa extract; Lagerstroemia speciosa extract; Mussaenda frondosa extract; Oldenlandia corymbosa extract; Orthosiphon aristatus extract; Paederia foetida extract; Phaleria macrocarpa extract; Phyllanthus buxifolius extract; plant extract; Rotheca serrata extract; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; Woodfordia floribunda extract; antifungal agent; antiinfective agent; plant extract; solvent; antimicrobial activity; Article; broth dilution; Candida albicans; controlled study; drug design; drug screening; Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli; in vitro study; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; plant leaf; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus; traditional Indonesian medicine; traditional medicine; bacterium; chemistry; drug effect; growth, development and aging; Indonesia; isolation and purification; Lamiaceae; medicinal plant; microbial sensitivity test; Orthosiphon; phytotherapy; Woodfordia; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antifungal Agents; Bacteria; Candida albicans; Ethanol; Indonesia; Lamiaceae; Medicine, Traditional; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Orthosiphon; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Plant Leaves; Plants, Medicinal; Solvents; Woodfordia",,"alcohol, 64-17-5; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antifungal Agents; Ethanol; Plant Extracts; Solvents","Biotek, United States","20175001, 20175020","This research was financially supported by Erasmus Mundus project ALFABET (Asia: Life, Food, Agriculture, Biology, Economics, Technology) [55207], Czech University of Life Sciences Prague Grant Agency project CIGA [20175001] and Internal Grant Agency project IGA [20175020].","Abdulah, R., Antibiotic abuse in developing countries (2012) Pharm Regulat Affairs: Open Access, 1, pp. 1-3; Akiko, K.M., Hiroshi, K., Fumiko, K., Hisao, E., Katsutoshi, T., Shigetoshi, K., Yasushi, T., Tohru, K., Woodfruticosin (Woodfordin C), a new inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase II (1992) Biochem Pharmacol, 44, pp. 1961-1965; Alimboyoguen, A.B., Castro-Cruz, D., Shen, K.A., Li, C.C., Ragasa, C.Y.W.T., Chemical constituents of the bark of Aleurites moluccana L.

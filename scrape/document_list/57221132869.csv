Transportation is a tool in the form of a vehicle that purpose is to move an item from one place to another. In the current era of globalization, there are several companies that develop their business through online transportation, in addition to the shuttle service there is also a delivery or pick up of food/goods quickly that can provide convenience for the community. This paper describes the redesign of the box that motorcyclists could use in online transportation. The design concept is designed more innovative to design models and materials used are also more practical & efficient in terms of time in use both in terms of installation and dismantling of the box, the aim is to answer the problems of online transportation at this time, which are not only in terms of efficiency but also ergonomics. The research was conducted by observing the existing problems, then brainstorming in ergonomic box design and then making 3D modelling using the inventor's stress analysis method. to achieved a new innovative and ergonomic design for helping online transportation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Nürnberg, Analysis of using cargo bikes in urban logistics on the example of stargard (2019) Transportation Research Prodia, 39, pp. 360-369. , and Mariusz; Pratama, Aditya Hadi, (2016) Kilas balik perkembangan transportasi online sepanjang tahun 2016, , https://id.techinasia.com, (accessed on December 12, 2019); Morganti, Elenora, Saskia, Seidel, Corinne, Blanquart, Laetitia, Dablanc, Barbara, Lenz, The impact of e-commerce on final deliverie alternative parcel delivery services in France and Germany (2014) Transportation Research Prodia, 4, pp. 178-190; Punakivi, Mikko, Hannu, Yrjola, Jan, Holmstrom, Solving the last mile issue reception box or delivery box (2001) International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 31, pp. 427-437; Broberg, Ole, Integrating ergonomics into the product development process (1997) International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, 19, pp. 317-327",,,,"IOP Publishing Ltd","2020 International Conference on Advanced Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, ICAMIE 2020","8 July 2020 through 8 July 2020",,165915,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Therefore, it is imperative to use information systems, so that monitoring and evaluation activities can run smoothly and in real time. Binus University has done implementations for the last five years by using a Performance Management dashboard, so that user satisfaction needs can be measured, especially users in the academic area by applying the DeLone and McLean method. This research utilized an instrument from DeLone and McLean as well as measured the questionnaire results of all the academic users of Binus University. The final results are expected to be able to improve the services and features needed by the academic users of Binus University. © 2019 IEEE.","dashboard; DeLone and McLean method; management; performance; satisfaction","Information use; Management; Real time systems; Surveys; dashboard; DeLone and McLean method; Monitoring and evaluations; performance; Performance management; Real time; satisfaction; User satisfaction; Information management",,,,,"Bradley, R.V., Pridmore, J.L., Byrd, T.A., Information systems success in the context of different corporate culture types: An empirical investigation (2006) Journal of Management Information Systems, 23 (2), pp. 267-294; Burton-Jones, A., Straub, D., Reconceptualizing system usage: An approach and empirical test (2006) Information Systems Research, 17 (3), pp. 220-246; Caldeira, M.M., Ward, J.M., Understanding the successful adoption and use of IS/IT in SMEs: An explanation from Portuguese manufacturing industries (2002) Information Systems Journal, 12 (2), pp. 121-152; Choe, J.M., The relationships among performance of accounting information systems, influence factors, and evolution level of information systems (1996) Journal of Management Information Systems, 12 (4), pp. 215-239; Devos, J., Landeghem, H.V., Deschoolmeester, D., Theoretical foundations for IS success in small-and medium-sized enterprises (2012) IGI Global; Gatian, A.W., Is user satisfaction a valid measure of system effectiveness?

Knowledge management is known as one of the key factors for the enterprises to have a sustainable competitive advantage. Many enterprises would like to have knowledge management implemented in their company but they are often confused about the direction how to create a successful knowledge management and this point is especially true for small to medium enterprises (SMEs). Besides the blurry of the step in creating a good knowledge management for SMEs, they also have a lot of doubts of it as knowledge management may costs too much. This skepticism drives SMEs owner to be afraid to spend their resources to implement a knowledge management and it may make them lose their competitive advantage. Methodologies for this research are literature view, observations, interview, and case study. This research is focus to create a model of knowledge management strategy that may help SMEs to better understanding about the useful of knowledge and how to implement the model easily. © 2015 IEEE.","knowledge; knowledge management; knowledge management strategy; knowledge management success model; small and medium enterprises; sustainable competitive advantage","Big data; Competition; Digital storage; Sustainable development; knowledge; Knowledge management strategy; Knowledge management success; Small and medium enterprise; Sustainable competitive advantages; Knowledge management",,,,,"Wang, X., (2010) An Empirical Investigation of Personal and Social Factors on Knowledge Sharing in China, , University of Twente; Rasulam, J., Vuksic, V.B., Stemberger, M.I., The impact of knowledge management on organizational performance (2012) Economic and Business Review, 14 (2), pp. 147-168; Mathis, R., Jackson, R., (2010) Human Resource Management, , Cengage Publishing; Huang, L.S., Quaddus, M., Rowe, A.L., Lai, C.P., An investigation into the factors affecting knowledge management adoption and practice in the life insurance business (2011) Knowledge Management Research & Practice, 9, pp. 58-72; Sarayreh, B., Mardawi, A., Dmour, R., Comparative study: The nonaka model of knowledge management (2012) International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Technology, 1, p. 6. , August; Hegazy, F.M., Ghorab, K.E., The influence of knowledge management on organizational business processes and employees benefits (2014) International Journal of Business and Social Science, 5, p. 1; Leal-Rodriguez, A., Leal-Millan, A., Roldan-Salgueiro, J.L., Ortega-Gutierrez, J., Knowledge management and the effectiveness of innovation outcomes: The role of cultural barriers (2013) The Electronic Journal of Knowledge Management, 11 (1), pp. 62-71; Hussain, I., Si, S., Ahmed, A., Knowledge management for smes in developing countries (2010) Journal of Knowledge Management Practice, 11, p. 2; Cagnazzo, L., Tiacci, L., Rossi, V., Knowledge management system in smes within stable enterprise networks (2014) WSEAS Transactions on Business and Economics, 11; Walliman, N., (2011) Research Methods the Basics, , London Routledge; Seidman, I., (2012) Interviewing As Qualitative Research: A Guide for Researchers in Education and the Social Sciences, , Teachers college press; Alsaawi, A., A critical review of qualitative interviews (2014) European Journal of Business and Social Sciences, 3 (4), pp. 149-156. , July; Dalkir, K., (2011) Knowledge Management in Theory and Practice, , 2nd ed., The MIT press Cambridge: Massachussets; Evangelista, P., Esposito, E., Lauro, V., Raffa, M., The adoption of knowledge management systems in small firms (2010) Electronic Journal of Knowledge Management, 8 (1), pp. 33-42; Wang, S., Noe, R.A., Knowledge sharing: A review and directions for future research (2010) Human Resource Management Review, 20, pp. 115-131","Suryawan, A.D.; Information Systems Department, Indonesia; email: asuryawan@binus.edu","Hendriana Y.Pranolo A.Prahara A.Ismi D.P.","IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","International Conference on Science in Information Technology, ICSITech 2015","27 October 2015 through 28 October 2015",,119465,,9781479983865,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

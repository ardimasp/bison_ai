In Jakarta, Indonesia, for example, this use can be seen in advertisements, headlines, brochures, even the street hawkers. The word snake replacing snack in front of a shop shows that the society is actually aware of the importance of English. The paper analyzes the use of real English found in the society in order to find out how far the English used follows the standard and the possible causes of the non standard expressions. The data were taken from 20 writings consisting of advertisements, boards, and notices from the public places. They were analyzed qualitatively in terms of the phonology, vocabulary, grammar and meaning. The results show that the non-standard use of real English is found in spelling, vocabulary, word choice, and grammar. The causes are the influence of Indonesian or the local language, lack of vocabulary, the use of Indonesian grammar, and the writing of words which is based on what is heard. Some expressions can be understood directly but some others cannot be understood at all. The results of this research can be used by the lecturers as the input to design the curriculum of English for society as their community service. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Grammar; Meaning; Real English; Vocabulary",,,,,"Binus University","We thank you Bina Nusantara University which supported us in conducting this research.","Brumfitt, C.J., (2001) Individual Freedom in Language Teaching: Helping Learners to Develop a Dialect of Their Own, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Seidlhofer, B., A Concept of International English and Related Issues: From ‘Real English’ to ‘Realistic English’?

A metaphor comprehension test was given to 110 Indonesian university students, whose English proficiency scores were about equal to TOEFL of more than 500. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Pearson Correlation Standard. The results show that the mean of the students’ metaphor comprehension is 3.54 in the range of 1–5. The correlation between metaphor comprehension ability and English proficiency is proved to be not significant which means that students having high English proficiency do not always obtain high scores in metaphor comprehension or vice versa. Metaphor comprehension correlates positively to English exposure meaning that students practicing English in the four skills obtained better scores than those who did not, and the strongest correlation occurs in reading exposure. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","English exposure; English proficiency; Metaphor comprehension",,,,,,,"Lakoffand Johnson, G., (2008), Metaphors We Live by, University of Chicago Press, London; Knowles, M., Moon, R., (2006) Introducing Metaphor, , Routledge, New York; Anna, O.S., (1999) Metaphors in Discourse Society, 10, p. 191; Amouzadeh, M., Tavangar, M., (2004) International Journal of Cultural Studies, 7, p. 147; Charteris-Black, J., (2005) Politician and Rhetoric: The Persuasive Power of Metaphor, , Palgrave Macmillan, Hampshire; Cortazzi, M., Jin, L., (1999) Bridges to Learning-Metaphors of Teaching Learning and Language, Researching and Appying Metaphors, pp. 149-176. , edited by L.

In a different context such as foreign language learning, a study by Cox and Davies (2012) found that such technology could be used to predict the speaking competency of a group of students for a language training program. To extend the context of the study, we investigated whether the online speech recognition technology would show impacts in helping EFL students’ language competency in two skills: Speaking and Writing. In our experimental—observation study, an online speech recognition technology, https://dictation.io/ was used as medium for students to give a small talk about assigned topics used in English high stake tests and have it transcribed the talk into texts. The nature of speaking and writing of the online application made it possible for us to analyze both the spoken and written expressions that students used. The students’ responses were then evaluated through the range of vocabulary and expressions they used, their fluency in expressing ideas and their accuracy in producing the sentences. By using http://www.paperrater.com/the result displays the results of students’ writing and speaking skills, as well as the language accuracy from the spoken texts they produced. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","English speaking competency; English writing competency; Speech recognition",,,,,,,"Biber, D., Conrad, S., Reppen, R., Byrd, P., Helt, M., (2012) TESOL Quarterly, 36, p. 9; Cox, T.L., Davies, R.S., (2012) CALICO Journal, 29, p. 601; Dewi, I.D., Rifai, I., Suprato, D., Free online high stake english test exercises: The evaluation, the learning/the teaching methods (2014) A Research Paper Presented at the 14Th Asianefl Conference in the Philippines; Halpern, L., (1984) College Composition and Communication, p. 35; Horner, B., Lu, M.Z., Royster, J.J., Trimbur, J., (2011) College English, p. 73; Yun, K.A., Costantini, C., Bilingsley, S., (2012) Communication Research Reports, p. 29","Dewi, I.I.; Bina Nusantara University, Jl.

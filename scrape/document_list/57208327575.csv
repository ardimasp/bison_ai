It used associative research and data was collected through a field survey from three Green Nitrogen outlets at different PERTAMINA Gas Stations. A set of questionnaires was distributed to 114 customers of green nitrogen outlets in Jakarta. Multiple regression analysis assessed the impact on purchase decision of three key constructs of brand image, including corporate image, user image, and product image. The results showed three components, namely corporate image, user image, and product image simultaneously had a significant influence on the purchase decision. However, corporate image and product image were variables that had a significant influence. Product image was a variable that had the most significant influence, while user image had no significant influence on purchase decision. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Brand image; Corporate image; Product image; Purchase decision; User image",,,,,,"Baseer Ali Durrani, B.A., Godil, D.I., Baig, M.U., Sajid, S., Image of brand image on buying behavior among teenagers (2015) European Scientific Journal, 11 (5), pp. 155-168; Dodds, W.B., Grewal, D., Effect of price, brand and store information on buyer’s product evaluation (1991) Journal of Marketing Research, 28 (3), pp. 307-319; Ferrinadewi, E., (2008) Merek Dan Psikologi Konsumen, Implikasi Pada Strategi Pemasaran, , Yogyakarta: Graha Ilmu; Gilaninia, S., Mousavian, S.J., The investigation and analysis impact of brand image in Iran (2011) African Journal of Business Management, 6 (25), pp. 7548-7556; Grewal, D., Monroe, K.B., Krishnan, R., The effects of price-comparison advertising on buyers’ perceptions of acquisition value, transaction value and behavioral intentions (1998) Journal of Marketing, 62 (2), pp. 46-59; Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., (2008) Prinsip-Prinsip Pemasaran, 1. , Erlangga, Jakarta; Kotler, P., Keller, K., (2009) Manajemen Pemasaran, , 13th ed., B.

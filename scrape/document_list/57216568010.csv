In order to improve the quality of logistics, business companies need to adopt e-logistics services to provide a more accurate, faster, and precise delivery. In this paper, a new model of smart contract is proposed, with the implementation to the e-logistics in the healthcare sector, by using the technology of IoT together with smart contract to enable users to get the information of their goods in real-time accurately. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

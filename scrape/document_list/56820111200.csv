Domestic tourism in Bali, Indonesia, has been growing rapidly in the past few years, and since Bali’s economy relies heavily on tourism, it is essential to maintain its long-term viability as a tourist destination. The aim of this research is to measure domestic tourists’ satisfaction and loyalty based on their overall destination experience, in Bali. It also examines the relationship between destination experience, reflected by experience with destination environment and service infrastructure, satisfaction, and loyalty, as reflected by intention to return and intention to share positive WOM. Different analysis such as descriptive analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was employed to answer the objectives of this research. The results of study indicated tourists were highly satisfied with their travel experience in Bali and they intend to visit the destination again. They were also willing to share positive WOM with others regarding Bali. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Bali; Destination experience; Loyalty; Quantitative; Satisfaction; Service infrastructure",,,,,,"Baker, A., Crompton, L., Quality, satisfaction, and behaviour intentions (2000) Annals of Tourism Research, 27 (3), pp. 785-804; Bigne, J., Sanchez, M., Sanz, S., Relationship among residents’ image, evaluation of the stay and post-purchase behavior (2005) Journal of Vacation Marketing, 11 (4), pp. 291-299; Buckley, R., A framework for ecotourism (1994) Annals of Tourism Research, 21 (3); (2015) Southeast Asia Has among the Highest Social Network Usage in the World, , http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Southeast-Asia-Has-Among-Highest-Social-Network-Usage-World/1013275, Retrieved June 3, 2016, from; Goeldner, R., Ritchie, B., (2012) Tourism: Principles, Practices, Philosophies, , 12th ed.).

Although residents’ perception toward tourism has significantly influenced tourism development, still there is a lack of academic studies in Indonesia to show the support of tourism by the local community. The purpose of this research is to determine the cultural, economic, and environmental effects of tourism on the culture of the local people in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. A qualitative approach through face-to-face interviews conducted to know the viewpoints of local people from Yogyakarta. The findings propose new insights into the different impacts of tourism and community development practices. These findings show the positive and negative aspects of tourism on the local community. This study concludes that although the host population perceives different point of views with tourism development, overall the Yogyakarta residents are happy about the economic benefits it brings to their community. Finally, the results of this research present some managerial implications and practical information for both the Ministry of Tourism and stakeholders in the tourism industry. © 2016, ASERS Publishing House.

Objective: This study aims to identify factors affecting visitor’s satisfaction towards shopping facilities at international airport in Jakarta. Data was collected using survey technique, where questionnaire was distributed to 200 visitors at Terminal 2, Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. Results: The result of multiple linear regression analysis shows that physical environment of shopping facilities and personal factors of visitors have significant relationships and effect toward visitor’s satisfaction at the airport shopping facilities. The result also shows that café is the most visited outlet at the respective airport. Conclusion: The study indicates that physical environment contributes more than personal factors on satisfying visitors at airport shopping facilities. Nevertheless, both aspects should be of airport management’s concern. Airport management can consider doing refurbishment to the shops as well as forming effective marketing strategies to convey positive message to the visitors about airport shopping. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

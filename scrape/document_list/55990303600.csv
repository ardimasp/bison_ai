The robot is a prototype of remote control toy car but it is controlled via web and not via radio wave as what we found nowadays. The robot is utilized with a camera where the surveyor can observe surrounding area via web and navigates the robot to reach the desired destination. There are several parameters that were measured to understand the robot s performance such as accuracy, pricing and robustness. Data were taken in surrounding area both with and without obstacles. Nevertheless, the experiment result showed that the error rate was 20% which is quite severe in area with obstacle and error can be reduced if the robot is designed with closed loop system. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Open loop; Remote control; Robot; Survelliance; Web-based",,,,,,"(2011) Suara Karya, Perlindungan Jamsostek Kasus Kecelakaan Kerja Masih Tergolong Tinggi, , http://www.jamsostek.co.id/content/news.php?id=2128, Anonymous.

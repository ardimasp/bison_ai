Research using visual language theory with case studies of two wayang-themed games titled 'Mahabharat Warrior' and 'Kurusetra'. The theory of visual language is used to determine how the visual representation of the form of wayang that use the Space-Time-Plane (STP) system into the game character using the Naturalist-Perspectives-Momentopname (NPM) system. The results of this study indicate that the characters in the game have not been able to move the unique visual language of STP system using by the wayang to the visual language of NPM system in the game.

According to Stephen Cavalier (2011), the world history of the animation is divided into five large round that starts from the era before 1900 (The Origin of Animation) to the digital era (after 1986). The study results found, Indonesian animation in the context of five major round of animated world, started in the ’50 s. That year (1950) in the history of animation’s period, entered the era of transition from the golden age of traditional animation (cartoon) to the television era. In a review of the history of animation, the era of the ’50 s was the era of transition half a century’s history of modern animation. Based on these facts actually Indonesian animation has been growing for more than a halft century, but the development of Indonesian animation feels very slow when seen in the context of the world of animation history. Indonesian animation only began to rise again after the digital era of the 2000 s, or at the time of the reform era in the context of Indonesia’s political history. On the other hand, the development of Indonesian animation, particularly animation as a medium of artistic expression (experimental animation) which took a different path from the narrative animated commercial (mainstream animation) has joined in celebrating and gaining recognition in the international animation festivals since the 80 s until 90 s. This path pioneered by academic artists who view an animation from the strong perspective of arts. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Animation; History; Indonesia; Indonesian animation",,,,,,"Bendazzi, G., (1994) Cartoons: One Hundred Years of Cinema Animation, , John Libbey, London; Biran, M.Y., (2009), Sejarah Film; 1900-1950, Komunitas bambu, Depok; Cavalier, S., (2011) The World History of Animation, , University of California Press, California; Harun, A., Rahim, R.A., (2008), Analyzing the first malaysian animated film “Hikayat sang kancil,” Faculty of Art and Design Universiti Teknologi MARA Shah Alam, Malaysia; Linsenmaier, T., (2008) Why Animation Historiography?

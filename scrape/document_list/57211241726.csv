Game play activities are often carried out by children with special needs can be a support learning and therapy due to his players the game has interaction without having to meet with his co-star in person. Starting from these data, this study aims to create a model of the System Dynamics approach. Data collected will be simulated by variables other support. The simulation results of the model will be seen autistic children therapy behavior. The results are then analyzed to create an alternative to the existing model. The benefit of this research is to know the description of game play to treatment of children with special needs. The results of simulation showed that playing games in an average time children with autism play therapy can help improve the quality of children with autism if children with autism play the game in a long time actually showed a decrease. © 2019 IEEE.","action games; autism; children with special need; simulation model; system dynamics","Diseases; Information management; System theory; action games; autism; Simulation model; Special needs; System Dynamics; Computer games",,,,,,"(2013) Video Game Use in Boys with Austism Spectrum Disorder, , Community Practitioner.

Many methods used to change learning activities become more enjoyable and interested. This study proposed a new method in learning activities, by applied augmented reality technology in the learning process. The case study used in this paper are implementation the augmented reality in studied subjects related to train technology. In this study, author implement augmented reality on learning material, combines real and virtual things in one media, in this case a mobile device. The impact of implementation of augmented studied, at the end of experiment, author can conclude when implement augmented reality technology in learning material helps the learning process and increasing the impressive and fun factor in learning process and make the learning process more interested. Implementation of Augmented Reality in learning material gives more information about the object being studied, information about on shapes, textures, and provide more visualization for the object. © 2019 The Authors.

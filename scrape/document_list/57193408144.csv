The need for a new culinary center that can become a new communal space for urban communities requires a design approach that supports the creation of sustainable architectural designs in terms of social aspects. The application of the concept of threshold space is done through qualitative design methods in designing culinary centers in Palmerah - Central Jakarta that provide and sell food and drinks. The design of this culinary center is expected to become a new communal space that functions as a recreational space and a space for social interaction that functions well. Threshold space concept was chosen to be applied in the design because it functions as a transition space that connects one function to another, so that integration between spaces is also well created. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","culinary center; social interaction; threshold space","Beverages; Economic and social effects; Social aspects; Communal space; culinary center; Design approaches; Design method; Social interactions; Sustainable architectural design; threshold space; Urban community; Architectural design",,,,,"Pusat Statistik, B., (2019) Jakarta Dalam Angka; Boettger, T., (2014) Threshold Spaces: Transitions in Architecture, Analysis and Design Tools; Katrigis, C., Thomas, C., (2014) Design and Equipment for Restaurant and Foodservice: A Management View, Third Edition; Nio, S., Dewi, J., (2017) Threshold Space Sebagai Pendekatan Desain Ruang Terbuka di Kawasan Kota Tua Jakarta Prosiding Seminar Heritage IPLB, , https://seminar.iplbi.or.id/; Pribadi, H.G., Potensi Wisata Kuliner Kota Muntilan (2018) Jurnal Arsitektur KOMPOSISI, 12 (1), p. 15; Putri, T.L., Irfandi, N., Analisis Pengaruh Daya Tarik Wisata Kuliner Malam (WKM) terhadap Kunjungan Wisatawan di Kota Pekanbaru (2018) Ikraith Ekonomika, 2, pp. 135-137; Signh, R., (2015) Understanding Transition Space","Nurdiani, N.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: nnurdiani@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Physical quality of building materials is very standard and often it does not meet the expectations of the residents. Currently the use of environmentally friendly materials (eco-materials) in buildings is being actively socialized by the government to support sustainable development programs. This research was conducted with the aim to know the type of physical changes made by the residents to their residential unit, and the dominant building materials used by residents when making physical changes, as well as the proposed environmentally friendly materials that can be used by residents. The results showed that the dominant physical changes were performed by occupants: (1) physical changes that are related to the aesthetic reasons and improving the quality of dwelling unit (aesthetical and physical adjustment); (2) physical changes that are related to the fulfillment of function of dwelling unit in low cost flats (functional adjustment). Wall paint and ceramic materials are dominant materials that are often replaced and used by residents when making physical changes in residential unit.

Whereas, the local electricity or the grid is the main energy source for the lighting and water pump machine, therefore the energy source becomes a significant issue during this period. Currently, the local government has already provided diesel generators to substitute the local grid when it is off, however, the amount of the generators is still limited. This study, therefore, investigated an alternative energy for the electricity, particularly solar energy and this paper presents an analysis of the Jakarta duration of sunshine during rainy seasons in order to investigate which Crystalline Silicone solar cell type that can be implemented optimally for energy supply in the period of flood evacuation as well as for the shelter. A deep analysis on literature review was conducted on the three types of Crystalline Silicone solar cell, Jakarta local weather. Furthermore, the standard of International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) was also studied for the shelter design.

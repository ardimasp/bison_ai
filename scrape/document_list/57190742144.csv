INOVASI (Inovasi untuk Anak Sekolah Indonesia) is an educational partnership between Indonesia and Australia government that is aimed to find and understand ways to improve student learning outcomes in primary education – especially those related with literacy, numeracy, and inclusive education. This partnership program lasts for 12 months, in 2018-2019. The focus of this program is numeracy. The purpose of this study is 1) to find out whether there are differences in numeracy abilities of parents before the research is conducted and as tricky as research, and 2) to find out whether there are differences in the average numeracy ability of elementary school parents in Sumenep Regency. The population of this study was 180 parents of students taken from 3 elementary schools and 3 MIs. The sample in the study was 90 parents from 3 elementary schools. This research is quantitative. Data analysis was per formed on the results of the Pre-Test and Post-Test. Data were processed using SPSS 22.0. The analysis test conducted was Paired T-Test and Anova Test. The conclusions of this research are: 1) there are differences in numeracy abilities of parents before and after training; 2) There is no difference in the average Pre Test results between three groups of parents from 3 different elementary schools, but there are differences in the average Pre Test results between the thr ee groups of respondents who come from 3 different elementary schools; 3) There is no difference in the average Pre Test and Post Test results between the four groups of respondents based on age classification; and 4) There is no difference in the average Pre Test and Post Test result s between the five groups of respondents based on their educational background. © IJSTR 2019.","Numeracy; Parents",,,,,,,"Đurišić, M., Bunijevac, M., (2017) Parental Involvement as a Important Factor for Successful Education Vključevanje staršev Kot Pomemben Dejavnik uspešnega, 7, pp. 137-153. , izobraževanja; Hoover-Dempsey, K.V., Battiato, A.C., Walker, J.M.T., Reed, R.P., Dejong, J.M., Jones, K.P., (2001) Parental Involvement in Homework, , (July 2014); Jay, T., Rose, J., Simmons, B., Finding “Mathematics”: Parents Questioning School-Centered Approaches to Involvement in Children’s Mathematics Learning, 27 (1), pp. 201-230; Kus, M., Numeracy, 27 (2), pp. 58-62; Melhuish, E.C., Phan, M.B., Sammons, P., Siraj-Blatchford, I., Taggart, B., (2008) Effects of the Home Learning Environment and Preschool Center Experience upon Literacy and Numeracy Development in Early Primary School, 64 (1), pp. 95-114; Ntekane, A., (2018) Parental Involvement in Education, , https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.36330.21440; Stephens, M., (2014) Numeracy in Practice: Teaching, Learning and Using Mathematics","Hartono, M.; Education Department, Indonesia; email: mhartono@binus.edu",,,"International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research",,,,,22778616,,,,"English","Int.

Mathematics teacher’s skills in senior high school encountered assorted defiance. It is required to be unravelling and then progressing. One endeavor to intensify the teachers’ competencies is by undertaking supervision. Supervision model, based on professional mathematics teachers’ competency, is a model that effectively increases the professional skills of mathematics teachers in senior high school. The study implemented a qualitative-based research approach, designed, and administered in Pekalongan City, Indonesia. Data collection included interviews, questionnaires, observation, and documentation. The validity of data is tested based on credibility, transferability, dependability, and conformability. The model developed is validated using the Delphi technique to obtain the final model. The practical implications of the findings in this study pose as the reference to create policies for teachers and a fundamental reference to construct another theory. The theoretical implications strengthened the component in clinical supervision. The finding of this supervision model emphasized that it anticipated the constraints found in previous studies. The data on the effectiveness of the model exhibited that 97.1% support the research finding. Therefore, it entailed the appropriate supervision model. © IJSTR 2019.","Effectiveness; High school; Mathematics teacher; Model; Professional competencies; Supervision; Teacher",,,,,"Binus University","This work was supported by Bina Nusantara University.","Mukhtar, I., (2009) Orientasi Baru Supervisi Pendidikan, , Jakarta: Gaung Persada; Terry, R.G., Rue, W.L., (2005) Dasar-Dasar Manajemen, , Jakarta: Bumi Aksara; Hasibuan, M.S., Manajemen sumber daya manusia (2010) Bumi Aksara; Oliva, P.F., Pawlas, G.E., (2004) Supervision for Today's Schools, , Jossey-Bass, An Imprint of Wiley. 10475 Crosspoint Blvd, Indianapolis, IN 46256; Neagley, R.L., Evans, N.D., (1980) Handbook for Effective Supervision of Instruction, , Prentice-Hall; Sahertian, P.A., (2000) Konsep Dasar & Teknik Supervisi Pendidikan: Dalam Rangka Pengembangan Sumber Daya Manusia.

To incorporate the syntactic information, Syntactically Enhanced LSA (SELSA) is used, whilst Stanford CoreNLP Natural Language Processing Toolkit is used for the Coreference Resolution. To evaluate the results, we calculate the average absolute difference between the system score and human score for each essay. Based on the results, we can conclude that syntactic information, when combined with Coreference Resolution, do not have higher correlation to human score than LSA (an average absolute difference of 0.15748 as opposed to LSA's 0.12597). But interestingly, the two techniques work better when they are used together, rather than when they are used separately. We also develop a new algorithm to calculate the scores, with a better average absolute difference, which is as high as 0.08969.","Automated essay scoring; Coreference resolution; Syntactically enhanced latent semantic analysis; Word order","Automation; Semantics; Syntactics; Absolute difference; Automated essay scoring; Co-reference resolutions; Latent Semantic Analysis; NAtural language processing; Stanford; Syntactic information; Word orders; Natural language processing systems",,,,,,"Landauer, T.K., Foltz, P.W., Laham, D., Introduction to latent semantic analysis (1998) Discourse Processes, 25, pp. 259-284; Kanejiya, D., Kumar, A., Prasad, S., Automatic evaluation of students' answers using syntactically enhanced LSA (2003) Proceedings of the HLT-NAACL 03 Workshop on Building Educational Applications Using Natural Language Processing, 2, pp. 53-60; Miller, T., Essay assessment with latent semantic analysis (2003) Journal of Educational Computing Research, 29 (4), pp. 495-512; Foltz, P.W., Laham, D., Landauer, T.K., Automated essay scoring: Applications to educational technology (1999) Proc. of the ED-MEDIA'99 Conference, , Charlottesville.

The background of this study is to create sustainable transport planning in order to minimize the impact of traveling to the environment. Jakarta is among the most polluted cities in the world with the biggest contributor to pollution in the transportation sector. According to this case, there needs to encourage the public can shift using mass public transportation and leaving private vehicles as a commuter vehicle. Promotion of public transportation mode must be accompanied by the construction of road infrastructure that focuses on pedestrian according to sustainable urban mobility principles. Pedestrian-way had a role of connecting between modes. By consider the criteria that exist in public spaces design, it is necessary to adjust the facilities provided in order to create an attractive and comfortable space for users who pass through it. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","pedestrian way; polluted cities; public spaces design; sustainable urban mobility","Mass transportation; Pedestrian safety; Transportation routes; pedestrian way; polluted cities; Public space; Public transportation; Road infrastructures; Sustainable transport planning; Transportation sector; Urban mobility; Urban transportation",,,,,"(2013) Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility: Global Report on Human Settlements 2013, , United Nations Human Settlements Programme; Behnam, N., A Proposed Sustainable Transportation and Urban Mobility Design (2015) MPRA Paper No. 76571; (2019) Pedoman Integrasi Antarmoda, , Institute for Transportation Development Policy (ITDP); Ana, F., Urban prototyping on a pedestrian walkway in Sao Paulo/SP-Brazil, according the 12 criteria of good public space (2015) Future of Places International Conference","Mariana, Y.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: ymariana@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

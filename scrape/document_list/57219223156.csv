In Indonesia, waste is a very common issue especially when it comes to landfills, pollution, loitering, and floods. This research is focused on finding out and rating the quality of Indonesia’s waste management activity from several views, and highlighting the specific issues that caused the problem. The K-Means clustering, fuzzy logic, and mathematical model were operated to decide the final quality of the waste management and Twitter was used as the social media source for this research. While the research provided the decision support model (DSM) which produces the concrete results. The final quality value of 56.02 means that the quality of Indonesia’s waste management quality is lacking in several aspects. Also, the result of study proposed several decisions which should be practically taken to solve the problem. © 2020, ICIC International.","Decision support model; Fuzzy logic; Indonesia; Social media; Text mining; Twitter; Waste management",,,,,"Binus University","We would like to thank BINUS University who has supported our works, particularly BINUS Graduate Program, Master of Computer Science.","Adi, G.

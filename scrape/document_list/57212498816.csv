Therefore, the architects began to endorse the concept of ecological architecture and green building design. This study aims to examine a project of a co-living boarding house in sub-urban area of jakarta based on ecological and green architecture principle theories by Sim Van Der Ryn and Stuart Cowan as well as Robert and Brenda Vale. Both principles were used to identify the ecological and green design parameters to test the boarding house. Results of the study revealed that there are 4 parameters of ecological-green architecture design, such as nature should be the main actor of the design; nature becomes a solution for every problem in the site; honor the user by involved them as a designer; and be a climate conscious building by conserving energy. From the examination conducted, it is also revealed that the boarding house qualified as an ecologic and green architecture design. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","co-living housing; concept; ecology architecture; green architecture","Ecology; Global warming; Historic preservation; Houses; concept; Design parameters; Ecological architecture; Green architectures; Green building design; Jakarta; Urban areas; Architectural design",,,,,"Setiawan, D., Study of ecological and sustainable architecture theories in a house in south Jakarta, the 2nd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development 2018 (ICEED 2018) (2018) IOP Conf.

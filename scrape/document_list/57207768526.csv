Resistance Spot Welding (RSW) is a process widely used in the industrial, mostly in the automotive industry. RSW is used to joint two or more materials in order to form the structure of the car. Resistance spot welding requires parameters that play as an important role in the welding process. There are three important parameters in the welding process, namely welding current (kA), welding time (cycle), and electrode force (kN). All three parameters should be optimized in order to produce high quality spot weld joints and less welding defects. In relation to Green Manufacturing, less defects means less waste and less consumption of materials. In the present study, we utilized RSM (Response Surface Method) to optimize the parameters by using statistical and mathematical techniques to analyze the problem. Optimal result parameters on welding current 8.7 kA, welding time 19,25 cycle, and electrode force 1,6 kN with diameter nugget 6,969 mm. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The present study deals with the influence of variation of O2 gas admixing to the Ar plasma discharge to examine the decolorization of methylene blue solution underwater through measurement of absorbance value of the plasma-treated solution by UV/VIS measurement. From the experiments it was found that the best result of methylene blue solution decomposition was obtained from the application of Ar 0.3 lpm with the admixing of O2 gas 0.3 lpm in an underwater plasma system generated at 1.56 kV. Modelling the decomposition process of methylene blue by using Ar+O2 plasma with variation of O2 flow rate, it was found that the system was confirmed to follow the first order kinetics equation. From this study it could be said that the plasma-based oxidation process is promising for the application in the decomposition of textile wastewater to support sustainable industry with environmentally friendly orientation. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

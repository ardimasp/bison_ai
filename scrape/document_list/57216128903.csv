A queue of visitors will be formed both to view the items and read the labels for information of interest. Visitors have limited time to read and view as a queue will built-up in due time. Handicapped visitors on wheel chair are very disadvantaged in enjoying exhibits due to the possibility of queue built-up that could cause inconvenience to other visitors. Current visitors most likely possess smartphones as communication device. Smartphones can be exploited to satisfy the need of information. QR labelling together with private cloud or network for information retrieval is presented as a viable solution. The system could cater the need of handicapped visitors. Visitors can conveniently collect information and study it at their convenience using their smartphones. Excessive queue forming can be avoided. This research is to find the position where a handicapped or any person can reliably scan the QR code label and the advisable size of label. The result is beneficial both for the exhibition organizer and the visitor. The parameters of interest are the distance and angle where a QR code label of certain can be reliably scanned. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Handicapped visitors; QR code; scanning angle; scanning distance; smartphone","Queueing theory; Smartphones; Communication device; Handicapped visitors; Most likely; OR-networks; Private clouds; QR codes; Scanning angles; Viable solutions; Exhibitions",,,,,"McLean, F., (2012) Marketing the Museum; Hooper-Greenhill, E., (2013) Museums and Their Visitors; Gilmore, A., Rentschler, R., Changes in museum management: A custodial or marketing emphasis?

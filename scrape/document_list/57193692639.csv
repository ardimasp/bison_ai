Utilization of rainwater as clean water resource is among the best option, especially in big cities like Jakarta. Excessive rainwater during wet season can be saved and used as the source of clean water during dry seasons. However, rainwater contains some pollutants, thus suitable treatment method should be utilized to improve its quality as clean water for daily needs. This study compared the effectiveness of zeolite, limestone, activated carbon and preheated 400°C limestone as additive to improve the rainwater quality. Results show that both limestone and preheated 400°C limestone improve all the parameters observed, meanwhile both activated carbon and zeolite had shown to have detrimental effect on water conductivity. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",,"Activated carbon; Limestone; Pollution; Water pollution; Water resources; Zeolites; Clean water resources; Clean waters; Dry seasons; Jakarta; Rainwater quality; Treatment methods; Water conductivity; Wet season; Activated carbon treatment",,,,,"(2016), http://savethewater.org/education-resources/water-facts, Information (August); (2016), http://www.ipsnews.net/2000/02/environment-indonesia-drowing-in-water-woes, Information (August); (2016), http://rainharvesting.com.au/knowledgecenter/reasons-for-using-rainwater, Information (August); (2016), http://www.bmkg.go.id/BMKG_Pusat/Kualitas_Udara/Informasi_Kimia_Air_Hujan.bmkg, Information (August); (2016), http://www.lenntech.com/applications/ultrapure/conductivity/water-conductivity.htm, Information (November); (2016), http://water.usgs.gov/edu/ph.html, Information (November); (2016), http://www.waterresearch.net/index.php/water-treatment/tools/totaldissolved-solids, Information (November); Syafalni, M.S., Setyandito, O., Han Yang, F., (2014) IJAES, 9, pp. 1811-1826; Gholikandi, G.B., Baneshi, M.M., Dehghanifara, E., Salehi, S., Yari, A.R., (2010) IJOT, 3, pp. 302-310; (2016), http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewhsemt/pubs/water-eau/devices-dispositifs-eng.php, Information (November); (2016), http://www.randwater.co.za/waterandinfastructuremanagement/pages/waterpurification.aspx, Information (November); Syafalni, S., Abustan, I., Dahlan, I., Chan, K.W., Umar, G., (2012) MAS, 6, pp. 37-51; Syafalni, S., Abustan, I., Brahmana, A., Zakaria, N.F., Abdullah, R., (2013) MAS, 7, pp. 39-49; Malau, G.G., (2014) Perbaikan Kualitas Air Hujan Untuk Air Minum (Menggunakan Karbon Aktif, Batu Kapur Alami, Batu Kapur Yang Dipanaskan 400 C Dan Zeolite), Bachelor Thesis, , (Bina Nusantara University); Sentoso, Y., (2014) Perbaikan Kualitas Air Hujan Menggunakan Karbon Aktif, Batu Bata,Limestone Dan Zeolit Untuk Air Minum, Bachelor Thesis, , (Bina Nusantara University)","Meilani; Civil Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: meilani@binus.edu","Iskandar I.Agustina T.E.Komariah L.N.Ismadji S.Yani I.Hasyim S.","","EDP Sciences","1st Sriwijaya International Conference on Engineering, Science and Technology, SICEST 2016","9 November 2016 through 10 November 2016",,126687,2261236X,,,,"English","MATEC Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015848938

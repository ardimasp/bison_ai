The availability of the internet opens up opportunities for companies to get relatively inexpensive resources without space and time limits, one of which is the use of cloud computing to support the company's business processes. Various types of companies have used cloud computing to run their businesses, one of which is SMEs. This paper aims to find out the success factors for using cloud computing for SMEs. A systematic literature review was conducted on 45 journal articles to get the results. The inspected journal paper were available from 2008 to 2018 and displayed 14 success aspects for cloud computing for SMEs. The main factor is organizational support to implementation cloud computing. This research only talks about the use of service cloud computing in Small Medium Enterprise. It is expected that future research will discuss other issues related to the application of cloud computing in Small Medium Enterprises. © 2020 IEEE.","Cloud computing; CSF; SLR; SMEs","Information management; Business Process; Journal articles; Organizational support; Service clouds; Small medium enterprise; Space and time; Success factors; Systematic literature review; Cloud computing",,,,,"Inayatulloh, Successful of smes through electronic commerce learning (2020) International Journal of Innovation, Creativity and Change, , E-ISSN: 2201-1323.

In its implementation, this agency provides assistance to communities throughout Indonesia to develop their creative efforts. The Indonesian government provides full support for the creative industry. The government provides assistance to the creative industry for facilitation of revitalizing physical infrastructure or funding and other guidance and assistance. To get this assistance the community must submit a proposal that will be assessed for its feasibility The proposal received will be assessed for its feasibility by considering several predetermined criteria Therefore, we create a system that can help management make the decision to provide assistance to those who need assistance.

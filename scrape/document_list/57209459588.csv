Cinemagraph approach offers a new visual language that was never explored before. Even with a simple presentation, the visual effect created using cinemagraph can be a memorable and deep experience. The ability of cinemagraph to draw attention and give a deep experience are some of the main reasons why it has succeeded to be a new visual communication media. Illustration as a visual communication media that also thrives in the digital world, can make use of cinemagraph. The researchers consider this possibility interesting and something worth reviewed. This research's purpose is to look into possibilities of using cinemagraph technique in illustration that might eventually be an effort to bring a breath of fresh air in the illustration world. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Photography; Visual communication; Digital world; Fresh air; Visual effects; Visual languages",,,,,"The authors gratefully acknowledge that the present research is supported by Ministry of Research and Technology and Higher Education Republic of Indonesia.

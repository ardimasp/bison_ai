The main problems of IT project failure are scope, time, and cost. These three contains is affecting to each other. Time and cost are the impact of the changing in scope. About 50% - 80% of IT Projects are defined as failure project which is mostly caused by over time and over cost. In client side, the problems come from unrealistic expectations also misunderstanding in collecting requirements in order to develop a system. These problems are leading into many changes in system development and changes will leads into poor scope management. In this research, we will analyze the influence of poor scope management affecting the successful of IT Project. In this research, began by analyze the correlation between Unrealistic Expectation and Changes in Project. The second steps is to analyze the correlation between Changes in Project and Overtime and Overcost. The Third steps it to analyze the Failure Project which defined by acceptance status of client and its correlation with Overcost and Overtime. Statistic method used in this research is Chi-Square. The result shows a tight bond between Unrealistic Expectation to Project Failure. © 2016 IEEE.","Change Management; IT Failure; IT Project Management; Scope Management; Unrealistic Expectation","Information management; Project management; Change management; Information technology projects; It project managements; Project failures; Scope management; Statistic method; System development; Unrealistic Expectation; Costs",,,,,"Hussain, O., Direct cost of scope creep in govermental construction projects in Qatar (2012) Global Journal of Management and Business Research, 12 (14), pp. 73-84; Rajkumar, G., Alagarsamy, K., The most common factors for the failure of software development project (2013) The International Journal of Computer Science & Application, 1 (11), pp. 74-78; Abdelmoniem, E.M., Mazen, S.A., Hassanein, E.E., A framework for governance of post-construction activities in is development projects (2012) Case Study in Egyptian Environment, 9 (5), pp. 814-1694; Stelth, P., Le Roy, G., Projects' analysis through cpm (2009) School of Doctoral Studies Journal, 1 (1), pp. 10-51; Hori, S., Nakatani, T., Katamine, K., Ubayashi, N., Hashimoto, M., Project management patterns to prevent schedule delay caused byrequirements changes (2010) IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems, 93 (4), pp. 745-753; Al-Ahmad, W., Al-Fagih, K., Khanfar, K., Alsamara, K., Khalid, A.S., Abu-Salem, H., A Taxonomy of an IT Project Failure: Root Causes (2009) International Management Review, 5 (1), pp. 93-104; Kaitlynn, W.M., Charles, D.B., The root cause of failure in complex it projects: Complexity itself (2013) Procedia Computer Science, 20, pp. 325-330; Montequin, V.R., Cousillas, S., Ortega, F., Villanueva, J., Analysis of the success factors and failure causes in information & communication technology (ict) projects in Spain (2014) Procedia Technology, 16, pp. 992-999",,,"BINUS Univerity;IEEE Indonesia Section;Wiley","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2016","16 November 2016 through 18 November 2016",,127842,,9781509033522,,,"English","Proc.

The difference between this research application and others is the search feature based on an image. The search feature is designed to match the shape and orientation. This application uses a Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm to conduct the matching feature process. The SURF algorithm is divided into three main steps. The first step is to retrieve the image information and turn it into a matrix, using a Hessian - Laplace Technique to define the feature point following the integral to reduce the computational time. It also uses a Difference of Gaussian in order to handle the object with an invariant scale. This process is called Fast Hessian. The second step is to define the orientation of the image using a Haar Wavelet Responses Technique. The third step is to match the feature points from both images using a four dimensional vector and K-Means as a classification technique. The result of this research is an application which is able to collect plant information using image matching. © 2016 IEEE.","CBIR; encyclopedia; image matching; SURF","Information management; Web services; CBIR; Classification technique; Dimensional vectors; encyclopedia; Research applications; Speeded up robust features; SURF; Web-based applications; Image matching",,,,,"Connolly, T., Begg, C., Database systems: A practical approach to design, implementation, and management (6th edition) (2014) Pearson; Giri, A., Meena, Y.K., Review paper on content based image retrieval (2014) The International Journal of Science and Technoledge, pp. 125-129; Blanken, H., Vries, A., Blok, H., Feng, L., (2010) Multimedia Retrieval, , Amsterdam: Springer; Arthiabd, K., Vijayaraghavan, J., Content based image retrieval algorithm using colour models (2013) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 2 (3), pp. 1343-1347; Santos, L.F., Dias, R., Ribeiro, M., Traina, A., Combining diversity queries and visual mining to improve (2015) IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia, pp. 357-362; Meena, M., Ram Singh, A., Bharadi, A., Architecture for software as a service (saas) model of cbir on hybrid cloud of microsoft azure (2016) 7th International Conference on Communication, Computing and Virtualization 2016, pp. 569-578; Krajník, T., Cristóforis, P., Nitsche, M., Kusum, K., Image features and seasons revisited (2015) Mobile Robots (ECMR),2015 European Conference, pp. 1-7; Saad, M.H., Saleh, H., Konber, H., Ashour, M., CBIR system based on integration between surf and global features (2013) ICIT 2013 the 6th International Conference on Information Technology; Bay, H., Tuytelaars, T., Gool, L.C., SURF: Speeded up robust features (2008) Computer Vision and Image Understanding (CVIU), 110 (3), pp. 346-359; Guo, F., Luo, X., Liu, Y., Research on feature extraction and match method based on the surf algorithm for mobile augmented reality system (2015) International Industrial Informatics and Computer Engineering Conference, pp. 615-619; Schmitt, D., McCoy, N., (2011) Object Classification and Localization Using SURF Descriptors, , Citeseer; Lu, G., (1999) Multimedia Database Management Systems, , Norwood: Artech House",,,"BINUS Univerity;IEEE Indonesia Section;Wiley","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2016","16 November 2016 through 18 November 2016",,127842,,9781509033522,,,"English","Proc.

Extrinsic plagiarism is now being handled well, but intrinsic plagiarism is not. Intrinsic plagiarism detection is being distracted by the mixed up structure and the using of another word which have the same meaning. Several methods have been research to handle this problem, not only using the pattern reading but also parsing the sentences, but still couldn't give one more accurate way to detect it. In this research, we propose to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create the new way to detect plagiarism. Begin with using syntactic parsing method to parse the suspicious document and find the list of words which have the same meaning with it while considering the Part-Of-Speech (POS) element of that word (semantic parsing). This algorithm also includes creating the new structure of the object before comparing them. The result of this research presents the accuracy comparison between Ferret, WCopyFind, and this algorithm. This algorithm gives the significant way to detect the plagiarism which is proven by TTest. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

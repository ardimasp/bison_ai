Therefore, this paper tries to analyze the potential development of lending fintech in Indonesia, along with its opportunities and challenges. The study of this research uses normative juridical. This paper concludes that the current regulation is still not enough in providing legal protection to consumers in conducting the transaction in lending fintech. Therefore, it is necessary to make a comprehensive regulation that regulates this so that public trust in the lending fintech company is higher. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Fintech; Current regulations; Financial service authorities; Indonesia; Legal protection; Public trust; Consumer protection",,,,,"(2019) Daftar Perusahaan Fintech, , OJK; (2019) Siaran Pers No. SP 06/IX/SWI/2019 Satgas Temukan 123 Fintech Ilegal, 30 Gadai Swasta Dan 49 Entitas Penawaran Investasi Tanpa Izin, , https://www.ojk.go.id/id/berita-dan-kegiatan/siaran-pers/Pages/Siaran-Pers-Satgas-Temukan-123-Fintech-Lending-Ilegal,-30-Gadai-Swasta-dan-49-Entitas-Penawaran-Investasi-Tanpa-Izin.aspx, OJK; Reily, M., (2019) YLKI: Layanan Jasa Keuangan Catat Aduan Konsumen Terbanyak di 2018 Artikel Ini Telah Tayang di Katadata.co.id Dengan Judul 'Ylki: Layanan Jasa Keuangan Catat Aduan Konsumen Terbanyak di 2018, , https://katadata.co.id/berita/2019/01/25/ylki-layanan-jasa-ke, katadata; Jakarta, L.B.H., (2018) Terjerat Pinjaman Online, 1330 Korban Mengadu Ke LBH Jakarta, , https://www.bantuanhukum.or.id/web/terjerat-pinjaman-online-1330-korban-mengadu-ke-lbh-jakarta/; Jakarta, L.B.H., (2019) Regulasi Tidak Melindungi Masyarakat, Pinjaman Online Pertaruhkan Nyawa, , https://www.bantuanhukum.or.id/web/regulasi-tidak-melindungi-masyarakat-pinjaman-online-pertaruhkan-nyawa/; Indonesia, P., (2019) Indonesia ' S Fintech Lending : Driving Economic Growth Through Financil Inclusion; Thomas, P., (2016) The Fintech Opportunity; Schueffel, P., Taming the Beast: A Scientific Definition of Fintech (2017) J.

Mostly the claim based of IT utilization for their governance. In general, a smart city definition is to describe a developed urban area that creates sustainable economic development and high quality of life by excelling in multiple key; economy, mobility, environment, people, living, and government. For public services, the law guarantees good governance by setting the standard for e-government implicitly including for local government or a city. Based on the arguments, this research tries to test the condition of e-government of the Indonesian city in 34 provinces. The purpose is to map e-government condition by measuring indicators of smart government, which are: transparent governance and open data for the public. This research is departing from public information disclosure law and to correspond with the existence law. By examining government transparency, the output of the research can be used to measure the effectiveness of public information disclosure law and to determine the condition of e-government in local government in which as part of a smart city. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Economics; Smart city; Sustainable development; E-governments; Good governances; IT utilizations; Local government; Public information; Public services; Smart governments; Sustainable economic development; Government data processing",,,,,"Albino Vito, A.B.U.R.M.D., Smart Cities: Definition, Dimension, Performance, and Initiatives (2015) Urban Technology, 22 (1), pp. 3-21; Bosek, L., (2017) Information Sharing, Transparency, and E-Governance among County Government Office in Southeastern Michigan, p. 128; Colldahl Caroline, A.F.S.J.E.K., (2013) Smart Cities: Strategic Sustainable Development for An Urban World, p. 9. , (Blekinge Institute of Technology); Bill Collins, A.R.J.P.G.C.W., E-Governance and Smart Communities: A Social Learning Challenge (2002) SSHRC Knowledge Based Economy; Driss, K., Good Governance and E-Government: Applying a Formal Outcome Analysis Methodology in Developing World Cintect (2009) International Journal Electronic Governance, 2, pp. 23-54; Rudolp Giffinger, C.F.H., (2007) Smart Cities: Rangking of European Medium-Sized Cities, , (Vienna); Elahi, K.Q.-I., UNDP on Good Governance (2009) International Journal of Social Economics, 36 (12), pp. 1167-1180; Haji, H.S., An Introduction on Literature of Smart City Civil Engineering and Urban Planning: An International Journal (CiVEJ), p. 10. , December 2016; Graham John, A.A.B.T.P., (2003) Principles for Good Governance in the 21st Century, , (Ottawa); Internet, A.J.P.J., Saatnya Jadi Pokok Perhatian Pemerintah Dan Industri, , https://apjii.or.id/downfile/file/BULETINAPJIIEDISI05November2016.pdf, Monday November 2016 [Accessed 10 July 2017]; Nalle, V.I.W., The Relevance of Socio-Legal Studies in Legal Science (2015) Mimbar Hukum, 27 (1), p. 179. , 182; Irianto, S., (2012) Kajian Sosio-Legal, 1, pp. 1-4. , Irianto S. ed S.

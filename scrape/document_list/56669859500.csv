Children with strong core muscles allow them to do any kinds of activities that mostly involve physical movement. The work tested on an education organisation that aims to strengthen core muscles by providing yoga-like poses. There are certified trainers that will coach the students along the way. However, mistakes could be made during the coaching because of different trainer's justification and whether the coaching processes were done correctly. Therefore, a solution is proposed to develop a computerized pose detector package which allows the trainers to improve the coaching with the students. The result is promising where the standardized pose could be implemented and compared to observed students' poses, however it is found that due to the uniqueness of the poses, it generates several unidentified results. © 2020 IEEE.","Children education; Computer vision; Human pose","Computer vision; Information management; Muscle; Students; Human pose; Physical movements; Gesture recognition",,,,,"We would like to show our gratitude to BINUS University RTTO for the support towards the research.","Akuhota, V., Nedler, S.F., Core strengthening (2004) American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation; Szeliski, R., (2010) Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications, , Springer; Bradski, G., Kaehler, A., (2008) Learning OpenCV, , O'Reilly; Cao, Z., Simon, T., Wei, S.-E., Sheikh, Y., (2017) Realtime Multi-Person 2D Pose Estimation Using Part Affinity Fields, , The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University; Ganesh, P., Human pose estimation: Simplified (2019) Towards Data Science, , https://towardsdatascience.com/human-pose-estimation-simplified-6cfd88542ab3, 26 March.

While buying furniture requires more consideration and is time-consuming, they tend to search for every information that they need on internet first, before taking further action of going to the physical store. Through the field research and interviews, it can be proven that customers in average need two or more trips before finally deciding to purchase. The proposed application is designed to help user find their way to the shop with a sufficient product knowledge and also reducing their consideration time to a faster purchase conversion. Augmented Reality will be used on the mobile application to let user see the color compatibility to the room and allow approximate size measuring. This is done by using a specific target size as a comparison to real life object size. Small size usability testing was conducted to several user, and the final result received great feedback as it was easily understood, self-explanatory and aided user to make decision faster. Eventually, the aim is that when the furniture arrives, customer will feel satisfied as a conclusion of their furniture purchase journey. © 2020 IEEE.","Augmented reality; Furniture shop; User experience","Augmented reality; Information management; Color compatibility; Customer experience; Mobile applications; Mobile augmented reality; Physical stores; Product knowledge; Usability testing; Younger generations; Sales",,,,,"The authors would like to recognize tremendous support towards the improvement of this research shown by BINUS University s RTTO department.","Morgan, I., Rao, J., Making routine customer experiences fun (2003) MITSloan Management Review; Lissitsa, S., Kol, O., Generation x vs generation y-a decade of online shopping (2016) Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services; Angus, A., Westbrook, G., Top 10 global consumer trends (2019) Euromonitor International: London, UK; Faulds, D., Mangold, W., Raju, P., (2017) The Mobile Shopping Revolution: Redefining the Consumer Decision Process, , Kelley School of Business, Indiana University; Nunkesser, R., Beyond web/native/hybrid: A new taxonomy for mobile app development (2018) 2018 IEEE/ACM 5th International Conference on Mobile Software Engineering and Systems; Pouryousef, S., Rezaiee, M., Chizari, A., Let me join two worlds! analyzing the integration of web and native technologies in hybrid mobile apps (2018) 2018 17th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications/12th IEEE International Conference on Big Data Science and Engineering, IEEE; Scholz, J., Smith, A., Augmented reality: Designing immersive experiences that maximize consumer engagement (2016) Business Horizons, 59 (2), pp. 149-161; Chylinski, M., Heller, J., Hilken, T., Keeling, D., Augmented reality marketing: A technology-enabled approach to situated customer experience (2020) Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy; Brengman, M., Willems, K., Kerrebroeck, H.V., Can't touch this: The impact of augmented reality versus touch and non-touch interfaces on perceived ownership (2019) Virtual Reality, 23 (3), pp. 269-280; Yussof, M.F., Salleh, S.M., Ahmad, A.L., Augmented reality: A systematic literature review and prospects for future research in marketing and advertising communication (2019) Intelligent and Interactive Computing, pp. 459-473. , Springer, Singapore; Chen, E.Y., Enrichr: Interactive and collaborative html5 gene list enrichment analysis tool (2013) BMC Bioinformatics, 14 (1), p. 128; Eisenman, B., (2015) Learning React Native: Building Native Mobile Apps with JavaScript, , O'Reilly Media, Inc; Scholz, J., Smith, A., Augmented reality: Designing immersive experiences that maximize consumer engagement (2016) Business Horizons, 59 (2), pp. 149-161; Bach, B., The hologram in my hand: How effective is interactive exploration of 3D visualizations in immersive tangible augmented reality?

Besides using traditional methods such as credit scoring, machine learning can also be used as a tool to classify applications for credit. Many research papers had tested and concluded of the ability of machine learning methods to classify good and bad credit. From the previous papers it was concluded that Ensemble Method, Support Vector Machine and MLP (Neural Network) showed the best accuracy in credit risk. However those previous papers compared only a few algorithms so it is difficult to determine which algorithm has the best performance. Therefore, this paper will compare the algorithms from previous paper by applying the German dataset to the algorithms as it is the most common dataset used for credit risk analysis. The algorithms compared are Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Ensemble Methods (random forest, bagging, boosting) and MLP. The performance will be measured using accuracy, average accuracy from 10 fold cross validation, AUC, Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision rate, F1. This paper will focus to find the most accurate algorithm for credit risk analysis. From the result it was found out that Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Bagging had a good result. However, since the scores were dispersed, it was difficult to conclude which algorithm had the best accuracy. At the end SVM was chosen as it was deemed to be the most accurate algorithm for credit risk analysis. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The algorithm uses speed up robust features that is invariant to both scaling and rotation of an image. The use of speed up robust features (SURF) technique is based on its capability to correctly recognize images with different sizes and various angles of rotation. The proposed work uses a modified SURF that uses non maxima suppression in finding local maxima in order to point exactly the highest value of gradient magnitude. Object cloning was as well implemented in order to avoid memory violation of the observed and model images and increases the speed of algorithm. The system was tested against several conditions including tested towards finding moving and stationed object from the observed video. Additionally, it was as well tested towards real live traffic with minimum light (at night) and during light rain that increase the noise and distortion level of a live monitored environment. The accuracy result is promising with an average of 90% correctness and average performance of 688 millisecond per frame. The work as well aimed to provide conclusion whether the use of a modified scale and rotation invariant technique such as SURF and non-maxima suppression could contribute positively in the area of live vehicle recognition systems. © 2019 IEEE.","computer vision; SURF; vehicle recognition","Clone cells; Computer vision; Information management; Features detections; Gradient magnitude; Non-maxima suppressions; Scale and rotation; SURF; Traffic conditions; Vehicle recognition; Vehicle recognition system; Vehicles",,,,,,"Semertzidis, T., Dimitropoulos, K., Koutsia, A., Grammalidis, N., Video sensor network for real-time traffic monitoring and surveillance (2009) IET Intelligent Transport Systems; Bay, H., Ess, A., Tuytelaars, T., Gool, L.V., Speeded-up robust features (surf) (2007) Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 110 (3), pp. 346-359; Lowe, D.G., Object recognition from local scale-invariant features (1999) International Conference on Computer Vision, , September; Hsieh, J.W., Chen, L.C., Chen, D.Y., Symmetrical SURF and its applications to vehicle detection and vehicle make and model recognition (2014) IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportaiton Systems, 15 (1); Devvy, A.O., Tedjojuwono, S.M., Vessel monitoring systems based on aerial images in sea environment (2018) International Conference on Information Management and Technology (ICIMTech), IEEE, pp. 1-9; Zhang, Z., Tan, T., Huang, K., Wang, Y., Three-dimensional deformable-model-based localization and recognition of road vehicles (2012) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 21 (1); Deb, K., Khan, M.I., Saha, A., Jo, K.H., An efficient method of vehicle license plate recognition based on sliding concentric windows and artificial neural network (2012) Procedia Technology, 4, pp. 812-819; Tedjojuwono, S.M., Fast performance Indonesian automated license plate recognition algorithm using interconnected image segmentation (2015) International Conference on Soft Computing, Intelligence Systems, and Information Technology, pp. 289-300; Smadi, M.A., Abdulrahim, K., Salam, R.A., Traffic surveillance: A review of vision based vehicle detection, recognition and tracking (2016) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 11 (1), pp. 713-726; Fang, J., Zhou, Y., Yu, Y., Du, S., Fine-grained vehicle model recognition using a coarse-to-fine convolutional neural network architecture (2017) IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 18 (7); Luo, X., Shen, R., Hu, J., Deng, J., Hu, L., Guan, Q., A deep convolution neural network model for vehicle recognition and face recognition (2017) Procedia Computer Science, International Congress of Information and Communication Technology, 107, pp. 715-720; Solomatine, D.P., Siek, M.B., Modular learning models in forecasting natural phenomena (2006) Elsevier: Neural Networks, 19 (2), pp. 215-224; Dreuw, P., Steingrube, P., Hanselmann, H., Ney, H., SURF-face: Face recognition under viewpoint consistency constraints (2009) Human Language Technology and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1-11. , RWTH Aachen University; Du, G., Su, F., Cai, A., Face recognition using SURF features (2009) IPPR 2009: Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision, 7496; Badrinath, G.S., Nigam, A., Gupta, P., An efficient finger-knuckle-print based recognition system fusing sift and surf matching scores (2011) International Conference on Information and Communications Security, pp. 374-387; Noguchi, A., Yanai, K., A surf-based spatio-temporal feature for feature-fusion-based action recognition (2010) European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pp. 153-167","Tedjojuwono, S.M.; Business Information Systems Program, Indonesia; email: smahatmaputra@binus.edu",,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","4th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2019","19 August 2019 through 20 August 2019",,152147,,9781728133331,,,"English","Proc.

Some of this challenges would come from large amount of images that needs to be analyzed along side with a typical natural image noise sea environment could impose. To automate the recognition process, image information systems needed to be implemented in such cases. Most of these processes involve recognizing an object in a scene, whether the object possesses similar characteristics to the reference image. There are many methods that can be applied to the schema. One of them is computer vision technique, which enables the systems to automatically identify objects within a given image samples. This work compares the implementation of such method on aerial images for sea environment monitoring system. Two of the most promising methods are SURF and SIFT. They both work similarly as descriptor which involve application of integral image, where storing information inside descriptors enable users to describe images that is needed for matching. In open sea scenario, it is important to be able to recognize objects from higher altitude from any view point, therefore this paper will be focusing more on evaluating descriptor and matching methods toward aerial images through detected key points and detected matching points. This work as well will conclude which of the methods are best to be implemented on analyzing object in sea environment samples based on the evaluation criteria. © 2018 IEEE.","Aerial images; SIFT; SURF; vessel monitoring systems","Antennas; Information management; Monitoring; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Aerial images; Computer vision techniques; Evaluation criteria; Recognition process; Sea environments; SIFT; SURF; Vessel monitoring systems; Image processing",,,,,,"Kourti, N., Sheperd, I., Greidanus, H., Alvarez, M., Aresu, E., Bauna, T., Chesworth, J., Schwartz, G., Integrating remote sensing in fisheries control (2005) Fisheries Management and Ecology, 12 (5), pp. 295-307; Lee, J., South, A.B., Jennings, S., Developing reliable, repeatable, and accessible methods to provide high-resolution estimates of fishing-effort distributions from vessel monitoring system (VMS) data (2010) ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67 (6), pp. 1260-1271; Palmer, M.C., Wigley, S.E., Using positional data from vessel monitoring systems to validate the logbook-reported area fished and the stock allocation of commercial fisheries landings (2011) North American Journal of Fisheries Management 2009, 29 (4), pp. 928-942; Anderson, K., Gaston, K.J., Lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles will revolutionize spatial ecology (2013) The Ecological Society of America, 11 (3), pp. 138-146; Jiang, L., Analysis of military-civilian integration influence factor for Chinese unmanned aerial vehicle industry (2015) International Conference on Management Engineering and Management Innovation (ICMEMI), Harbin; Song Xia, G., Hu, J., Hu, F., Shi, B., Bai, X., Zhong, Y., Zhang, L., Aid: A benchmark dataset for performance evaluation of aerial scene classification (2017) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 55 (7), pp. 3965-3981; Tang, T., Zhou, S., Deng, Z., Zou, H., Lei, L., Vehicle detection in aerial images based on region convolutional neural networks and hard negative example mining (2017) Sensors, 336; Zhai, M., Bessinger, Z., Workman, S., Predicting ground-level scene layout from aerial imagery (2017) IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR); Soria, P.R., Arrue, B.C., (2017) Etection, Location and Grasping Objects Using A Stereo Sensor on UAV in Outdoor Environments; Bay, H., Ess, A., Tuytelaars, T., Gool, L.V., Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) (2007) Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 110 (3), pp. 346-359; Marques, J.S., Bernardino, A., Cruz, G., Bento, M., An algorithm for the detection of vessels in aerial images (2014) Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance (AVSS), 11th IEEE International Conference; Panchal, P.M., Panchal, S.R., Shah, S.K., A comparison of SIFT and SURF (2013) International Journal of Innovative Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 1 (2), p. 326; Valgren, C., Lilienthal, A.J., Sift, surf & seasons: Appearancebased long-Term localization in outdoor environments (2010) Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 58 (2), pp. 149-156; Huo, C., Pan, C., Huo, L., Zhou, Z., Multilevel sift matching for large-size vhr image registration (2012) IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 9 (2), pp. 171-175; Madbouly, A.M.M., Wafy, M., Mostafa, M., Performance assessment of feature detector-descriptor combination (2015) IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, 12 (5), pp. 87-92; Khan, N.Y., McCane, B., Wyvill, G., Sift and surf performance evaluation against various image deformations on benchmark dataset (2011) International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications, pp. 501-506; Panchal, P.M., Panchal, S.R., Shah, S.K., (2013) Comparison of SIFT and SURFi Nternational Journal of Innovative Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 1 (2), pp. 323-327",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2018","3 September 2018 through 5 September 2018",,142373,,9781538658215,,,"English","Proc.

Although not in all cases, this problem could exist when a car has banner, regular pattern, car's front grill, that could miss understood by the system as license plate letters. The proposed work will implement filtering systems instead of machine learning approach. The filtering methods will follows three steps: detection filter based on the number of elements in the vector, based on the letter proportion of a license plate number, and based on the distance between detected letters. This approach will maintain the fast properties of the original algorithm and will increase the accuracy of localizing the license plate within the given image. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Learning systems; Optical character recognition; Detection filter; Filtering method; Filtering systems; License plate localizations; License plate recognition systems; Machine learning approaches; Original algorithms; Regular patterns; License plates (automobile)",,,,,,"Tedjojuwono, S.M., (2015) Fast Performance Indonesian Automated License Plate Recognition Algorithm Using Interconnected Image Segmentation, 516, pp. 289-300. , (Berlin: Heidelberg: Springer) Bali: Intelligence in the Era of Big Data; Kumary, R.S., Angel, B., Laya, T., License Plate Detection and Character Recognition Using Contour Analysis (2014) International Journal of Advanced Trends in Computer Science and Engineering, 3; Tran, D.D., Tran, L.H., Tran, V.P., Nguyen, V.H., (2005) Building An Automatic Vehicle License-Plate Recognition System, , (Can Tho, Vietnam: Intl.

This paper proposed a hybrid algorithm of interconnected image segmentation and contour extraction to locate and identify license plate for a given image. A pre-processed image will be segmented in several small images based on contour detection algorithm. The location of each segmented image's centre was then plotted into a Euclidean plane to get their relative positions. The distance and position of the segments evaluated in search of interconnected segments. This set of segments then will be fed into a cost function that determines its level of relevancy as a plate number. Set with highest score went through character recognition process to extract the meaning. Proposed work was tested in Indonesian license plate system with a high rate of correctness and average processing speed of 100 millisecond. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.","Contour detection; Interconnected-segments; License plate recognition","Algorithms; Big data; Character recognition; Cost functions; Geometry; Image processing; Intelligent computing; Intelligent systems; License plates (automobile); Optical character recognition; Soft computing; Contour detection; Contour Extraction; Euclidean planes; Hybrid algorithms; Interconnected-segments; License plate recognition; Processed images; Relative positions; Image segmentation",,,,,,"Manson, T., Automatic License Plate Recognition Systems (2006) Law and Order, 54 (12), pp. 72-77; Du, S., Ibrahim, M., Shehata, M., Badawy, W., Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR): A State-of-the-Art Review (2013) IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 23 (2); Chang, S.L., Chen, L.S., Chung, Y.C., Chen, S.W., Automatic License Plate Recognition (2004) IEEE Transaction on Intelligent Transport System, 5 (1); Arya, F., Suwardi, I.S., License Plate Recognition System for Indonesian Vehicles (2012) E-Journal Teknologi Industri, B-87; Anagnostopoulos, C., Anagnostopoulos, I.E., Loumos, V., Kayafas, E., A License Plate-Recognition Algorithm for Intelligent Transportation System Applications (2006) IEEE Transaction on Intelligent Transport System, 7 (3); Hermawati, F.A., Koesdijarto, R., A Real-Time License Plate Detection System For Parking Access (2010) Telkomnika: Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering, 8 (2), pp. 97-106; Rahman, C.A., Badawy, W., Radmanesh, A., A Real Time Vehicle’s License Plate Recognition System.

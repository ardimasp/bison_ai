The development of the ERP Quality model is based on the IS success model of DeLone and Mclean and the ERP quality model developed by Deshmukh. This research model consists of variable 9, namely information quality, system quality, vendor quality, training, hardware and software, top management support, skill of workforce, project management, perceive ERP benefits and ERP system success. Analysis using SPSS software using questionnaires that are distributed directly to 32 respondents. The results of this study are in the form of ERP Quality models with 9 variables and 44 instruments that have been validated in accordance with the provisions of the Validity and reliability test. From this result can be used in research with respondents who are more appropriate or larger in a Higher Education sector who want to evaluate the performance of the use of ERP on HCM. © 2019 IEEE.","ERP quality models; HCM; higher education sector","Human resource management; Information management; Project management; Resource allocation; Software quality; Surveys; ERP implementation; Hardware and software; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Information quality; Quality models; Reliability test; Top management support; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,"Davenport, T.H., Putting the enterprise into the enterprise system (1998) Harvard Bus.

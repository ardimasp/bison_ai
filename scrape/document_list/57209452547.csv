Digital technology is developing so fast and affecting the way people to see things differently by communicating with each other or seeking for some information. To help the digital native to gain any information regarding Indonesia cultural preservation, the researchers conducted questionnaire by collecting data from smartphone user to build the design interface for iOS and Android system. Results were implemented into two alternatives design using principle and design elements, although the outcome of interface design are visual aesthetically, the main problem it's not about the design. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Physics; Android systems; Cultural preservation; Design elements; Design interface; Digital natives; Digital technologies; Interface designs; Mobile applications; Mobile computing",,,,,"Koentjaraningrat, (2009) Pengantar Antropologi i, p. 72. , (Jakarta: Rineka Cipta); Nwegbu, M.U., Eze, C.C., Asogwa, B.E., Globalization of Cultural Heritage: Issues, Impacts, and Inevitable Challenges for Nigeria (2011) Library Philosophy and Practice, p. 674; Unesco, (2008) World Heritage Information Kit, , (Paris, France: World Heritage Centre); Prensky, M., Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants (2001) On the Horizon, 9, p. 1; Apjii, (2017) Penetrasi Dan Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia, , (Jakarta: Teknopreneur Indonesia); Takahashi, T., (2011) New Media Literacies in the Digital Age: Cross-cultural Research from US and UK, , (Japan: Yoshida Hideo Memorial Foundation); Bowen, J.P., Giannini, T., Digitalism: The New Realism (2014) EVA London 2014 Conference: Electronic Visualisation and the Arts; Beasley, S., Conway, A., Digital Media in Everyday Life: A Snapshot of Devices, Behaviors, and Attitudes Part 1: Mobile Device Ownership (2012) Museum and the Web 2012 San Diego 2012; Fantoni, S.F., Bowen, J., (2008) Digital Technologies and the Museum Experience: Handheld Guides and Other Media, pp. 79-96. , ed L Tallon and K Walker (Plymouth, UK: Alta Mira Press) Mobile Multimedia: Reflections from Ten Years of Practice; Cormier, B., (2018) Copy Culture: Sharing in the Age of Digital Reproduction, , (London: Vamp;A Publishing); Wickens, C.D., Lee, J.D., Liu, Y., Gordon-Becker, S., (2011) An Introduction to Human Factors Engineering, , (India: PHI Publisher); Enyon, R., Helsper, E., Digital natives: Where is the evidence?

It is not commonly practiced systematically, particularly in state owned companies. Hence, the purpose of this research is to develop a web-based knowledge management system design based on the path analysis results and TAM model to support state owned companies. The path analysis aims to determine the extent of the employee's intention to support knowledge management system creation. The data will be collected from 63 respondent questionnaire, interviews and observation in the construction consulting company. The research results revealed the significance between attitude toward computer and organizational culture toward the intentions of employees using knowledge management systems. Therefore, the knowledge management system design is recommended to apply in the company with the suggestive KMS features. © 2020 IEEE.","Knowledge management system; OOAD; Path analysis; State owned companies; TAM","Behavioral research; Human resource management; Knowledge based systems; Regression analysis; Surveys; Systems analysis; Consulting companies; Knowledge management system; Organizational cultures; Path analysis; Research results; State-owned companies; Support knowledge; Web based; Knowledge management",,,,,"Yusof, M.N., Bakar, A.H.A., Knowledge management and growth performance in construction companies: A framework (2012) Procedia-Soc.

As industry 4.0 constitutes a new operations system, adjustments and new mindset are integrated to enhance the industry process. Pertamina Hulu Mahakam had collaborated with GIS to improve its technological processes and monitoring activities. By using a gap analysis and systematic literature review, the results will illustrate the mapping analysis protruding the data integration and ownerships which has been the concern of the government in Indonesia. Using ArcGIS online, the tools ease the visualization and creation of the proposed map design to show an efficient mapping of the oil gas industries.

As the industrial 4.0 concepts has revolved and visible components have surfaced, this paper will use a systematic literature review methodology to assert the crucial elements of manufacturing industries in GIS and Industrial 4.0 concepts for providing a resolution in improving manufacturing industries. In addition, Arcgis online would be used to create a visualization of the proposed map design that shows the potentiality to solve current concerns of manufacturing industries in Bekasi. Along with the evolution of industrial 4.0, it is crucial to grasp on the idea on how to wisely integrate GIS and manufacturing industry location data in-order to track industries sites and monitor activity data ubiquitously. We conclude the analytical elements supported by the evidence and also a proposed map design which could aid the complex decision making and site location tracking of manufacturing industries in Indonesia. By doing this research, the motivation is to convince GIS contribution to manufacturing industry evolution, there are more reasons and evidence to implement GIS to adapt to the current developing industrial 4.0. For further research purposes, this prestudy is the initiation of manufacturing future foresight. © 2019 IEEE.","bekasi; geographical information system; Indonesia; industry 4.0; manufacturing industry; map design","Decision making; Geographic information systems; Industry 4.0; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Maps; bekasi; Complex decision; Indonesia; Literature reviews; Manufacturing industries; Map design; Research purpose; Systematic literature review; Industrial research",,,,,"(2018) Revolusi Industri 4. 0, , https://modengkara.net/revolusi-industri-4-0, Modengkara; Rauf, M.F., (2018) Internet of Things (IoT) Dalam Revolusi Industri 4. 0, , Medium, 29-May; Looking Back at 2017: Indonesia's Manufacturing Industry | Indonesia Investments, , https://www.Indonesiainvestments.com/business/business-columns/looking-back-at-2017-Indonesia-s-manufacturing-industry/item8441, [Accessed: 23-May-2019]; Jun, C., (2000) Design of An Intelligent Geographic Information System for Multi-criteria Site Analysis, 12 (3), p. 13; Gae Luna, N., Revolusi Industri Dan Indonesia 4. 0, , https://kumparan.com/nona-gaeluna1519199971381/revolusi-industri-dan-Indonesia-4-0, kumparan.

The high-level house of quality matrix was modified and used as a tool to evaluate the ongoing KMS implementation. Additionally, the Infosys KM Maturity Model was applied to determine its maturity level. Targeted result for this study is to form a recommendation for KMS implementation in the organization, especially in the private banking industry. KMS spread to various business field. It becomes an obligation for every organization to manage its knowledge flow and drive it to achieve innovation. As an industry with huge amount of knowledge come in and out daily, banking industry need to take their KMS to another level. By evaluating its KMS periodically, organization may improve the performance, quality and maturity level of its KMS. © 2019 IEEE.","HoQ; house of quality; KMS; knowledge management system; private banking industry","Houses; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Banking industry; Evaluation of knowledge; House of Quality; Indonesia; Knowledge flow; Knowledge management system; Maturity levels; Maturity model; Quality control",,,,,"Tanaji, B.S., (2012) Benefits of Knowledge Management System for Banking Sector, 3 (1), pp. 133-137; Chawla, D., Joshi, H., (2010) Knowledge Management Initiatives in Indian Public and Private Sector Organizations, 14 (6), pp. 811-827; Cham, T.H.T.H., Lim, Y.M., Cheng, B.L., Lee, Determinants of knowledge management systems success in the banking industry (2016) VINE J.

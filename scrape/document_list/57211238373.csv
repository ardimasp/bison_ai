Traditionally, it is used by customers inside the store to transport goods to the cashier during shopping and designed not to leave the store. It is an inconvenience and time wasted for customers who want to find the desired product in the store by using the traditional shopping trolley. Our goal is to develop an automatic moving trolley with smart shopping devices to solve the problem. Our smart shopping trolley is based on a two-wheeled mobile robot, developed in our previous research. This paper presents the hardware and software design of a smart trolley system. Our smart trolley used IOIO microcontroller and Android smartphone as sensors and controller. The trolley is modeled as a two-wheeled mobile robot. Android smartphone will control the robot by sending a signal to IOIO microcontroller paired with a robot's actuator and monitor the situation using the smartphone camera. Furthermore, we exploited the smartphone compass for robot navigation. This system is also equipped with the indoor positioning system to detect user position using Navisens which based on gyroscope and accelerometer in the smartphone. Finally, the results of the testing on robot navigation are presented. The result is our smart trolley system based on Navisens framework can move and show its location to the user. © 2019 The Authors.

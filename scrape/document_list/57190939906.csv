This service combines financial services and mobile technology to serve consumers more effectively and efficiently relating to their needs of financial services. Its market size is also growing giving sign that the service is widely accepted. However, there is still a lack of study especially relating to consumer behavior in in adopting the service. Therefore, the aim of this research is to study what factors influence consumers in adopting FinTech services by surveying Indonesian consumers. From 250 respondents, there are 204 forms filled. By conducting Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using Lisrel 8.80 software, all consumer's inputs are computed. From this computation, there are three results that can be drawn. First, it revealed that trust has generally influenced not only user's satisfaction but also his continuance use intention, meanwhile, his satisfaction may not influence his continuance use intention. Second, all factors of convenience, performance, cost advantages, referent network size and perceived complementary are all together influencing user' satisfaction. Third, all factors of authentication, non-repudiation, confidentially, privacy protection, and data integrity are all together needed to be considered. Therefore, any Fintech companies are suggested to be aware of these matters to win their customers in this market. © 2020 IEEE.","Continuance use intention; Fintech; Lisrel; Satisfaction; Structural equation modeling; Trust","Commerce; Fintech; Information management; Privacy by design; Cost advantages; Financial service; Mobile Technology; Non repudiation; Privacy protection; Structural equation modeling; Use intentions; User's satisfaction; Consumer behavior",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

In order to achieve this objective, several previous studies have been reviewed in order to identify eight best practices of TQM implementation in healthcare industry such as Top Management and Commitment (TMC), Teamwork and Participation (TWP), Process Management (PM), Customer Focus and Satisfaction (CFS), Resource Management (RM), Organizational Behavior and Culture (OBC), Continuous Improvement (CI), Training and Education (TE). In turn, these best practices are modeled as conceptual model and tested in order to evaluate its fitness to healthcare industry in Indonesia. A SEM (Structural Equation Modeling)-LISREL software was used to serve this objective. After administering a purposive questionnaire to several related stakeholders of an Indonesian Hospital, the LISREL software was run to see whether the model is fit or not. As a result, because the p-value 0.23 is larger than required 0.05 then the model can be confirmed to be fit. © 2017 IEEE.","Healthcare; Hospital; LISREL; Structural Equation Modeling; Total Quality Management","Customer satisfaction; Health care; Hospitals; Human resource management; Continuous improvements; Healthcare industry; LISREL; Organizational behavior; Resource management; Structural equation modeling; Total quality managements (TQM); Training and education; Total quality management",,,,,,"Bina, L., (2016) Transition ISO 9001: 2008 to ISO 9001:2015, , http://www.slideshare.net/PECBCERTIFICATION/pecbwebinar-49304033, accessed June 13; (2016) RS Bina Husada Cibinong, , http://m.cekspot.com/RumahSakitBinaHusadaCibinong, Cekspot, accessed September 6; Chassin, M.R., Galvin, R.W., The urgent need to improve health care quality (1998) Journal of the American Medical Association, 280 (11), pp. 1000-1005; D'Souza, S.C., Sequeira, A.H., Application of mbnqa for service quality management in health care organizations (2011) International Journal of Engineering, Science and Technology, 3 (7), pp. 73-88; Dhae, A., (2015) Every Year, Six Hundred Thousand Indonesian People Having Medical Treatment Abroad, , http://rona.metrotvnews.com/read/2014/10/21/308075/tiaptahun-600-ribu-orang-Indonesia-berobat-ke-luar-negeri, Tiap Tahun, 600 Ribu Orang Indonesia Berobat ke Luar Negeri, accessed Oktober 16; Duggirala, M., Rajendran, C., Anantharaman, R.N., Patient-perceived dimensions of total quality service in healthcare (2008) Benchmarking: An International Journal, 15, pp. 560-583; Dunbar, N., (2016) The State We Are In: A (New), , http://www.slideshare.net/CharlesPerkinsCentre/nicoladunbar, National Approach to Health Literacy in Australia,m accessed June 20; Feigenbaum, A.V., (1991) Total Quality Control, , 3rd ed.

PMB in this work is a type of radial PMB, which functions as the radial bearings of the Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) rotor shaft. Radial PMB should have a greater radial force than the radial force HAWT rotor shaft (bearing load). This paper presents a modeling and experiments to calculate the radial force of the radial PMB. This paper also presents rotational speed test of the radial PMB compared to conventional bearings for HAWT applications. Modeling using COMSOL Multiphysics 4.3b with the magnetic fields physics models. Experiments were conducted by measuring the displacement of the rotor to the stator for a given load variation. Results of the two methods showed that the large displacement then the radial force would be greater. Radial forces of radial PMB is greater than radial forces of HAWT rotor shaft. The rotational speed test results of HAWT that used radial PMB produced higher rotary than conventional bearings with an average increase of 87.4%. Increasing rotational speed occured because radial PMB had no friction. HAWT that used radial PMB rotated at very low wind speeds are 1.4 m/s with a torque of 0.043 Nm, while the HAWT which uses conventional bearing started rotating at a wind speed of 4.4 m/s and required higher torque of 0.104 N. © 2016 Author(s).",,,,,,,,"Uboguhigh, E.A., Hight Reliability and Low Friction Bearings for Wind Turbine, , Mini-project report.

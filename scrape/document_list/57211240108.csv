Although the government has done some actions to solve this, the severity of this problem still persist, which means we have to improve the effectiveness of solving this problem. In this journal, we propose an application to integrate the data about stunting cases in Indonesia with its causes details, in hope to increase the effectiveness of government interventions in solving this problem. The application we propose implements interactive multimedia method to increase simplicity, user engagement, intuitiveness, and availability in processing data on stunting case. © 2019 The Authors.

The desire to grow crops in the housing unit is increasingly gone. But now, all can be made using hydroponic techniques. Hydroponic technique is six cultivation by utilizing water without using soil by emphasizing the fullness of nutritional needs for plants. This farming technique is now being tucked away as an effort to present green land in a settlement with small and dense land. Therefore, a lay out design solution that accommodates residents in the housing area can be planted with hydroponics. Hydroponics is a business for urban farming. The research method used is an experiment with qualitative research. The plan for conducting the research activities will be a survey and field data collection, then continued with drawing work and designing layout. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Housing; Hydroponics; Lay out","Housing; Design solutions; Designing layout; Field data collection; Hydroponics; Lay-out; Qualitative research; Research activities; research methods; Engineering research",,,,,"Donald, W., (2003) Time Saver Standards for Urban Desain.; Philippe, P., (2004) Urban Form, p. 103; Terry, W., Anthony, R., Helen, B., (2003) Understanding Sustainable Architecture; Sue, R., Manuel, F., Stephanie, T., (2001) Ecohouse (A Design Guide); Gernot, M., (2006) Building with Earth (Cultural Issues in Vernakular Architecture)","Ardiani, Y.M.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: millaardiani@binus.ac.id",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Government has realized the need of infrastructure development for the settlement in small islands through the Presidential Decree. However, the development of infrastructure must follow the characteristics of its potential and constraints as an island. Bawean Island is a small island with an area approximately 190 km2 that is located in the Java Sea and in the north of Surabaya, which the capital of East Java, Indonesia. The soil morphology of Bawean is mountainous, and high and low hilly. So, it is necessary to identify the infrastructure in Bawean Island to facilitate the design of island according to its soil morphology. This research used qualitative method that is a direct survey by staying in Bawean Island. The data collection is by interviewing local people and supplemented with theories of islands.

In line with its existence and function, the existence of dams also faces several problems, one of them is erosion problem which threatens the sustainability of the dam function. Land conversion in upstream and around areas contributes to erosion. Natural landscape around the dam must certainly be maintained into the Greenbelt zone. On the one hand its existence must remain part of the natural landscape but on the other hand it will still function as part of the settlement area. The study is intended to map the greenbelt area that must remain natural and which areas can be utilized.

One of them is the village of Untia in Makassar which keeps the story about relocation history of fishermen's settlement in Makassar city. Initially, this village is very 'friendly' for the fishermen, especially the existence of canals that can be passed by the fishing boat to the front of the each house. However, the sustainability of this fisherman village is threatened by the development of urban functions that are urging towards it. From day to day, this village is segregated with the surrounding area, not only from its function but also from social point of view. This condition will be more severe related to the local government plan to reclaim sea far to the west side, thus threatening the sustainability of fisherman life in this village.

Audit report lag is detrimental to users of financial statements. Users of financial statements take longer to receive financial statements, even though they want to use the financial statements as a decision-making tool. This study aims to provide empirical evidence of the influence of profitability, leverage, audit opinion, and reputation of public accounting firms on audit delay in listed manufacturing companies in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. This research is quantitative, using secondary data. The population of this study is the food and beverage sub-sector manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2014-2017. The testing of the hypothesis used in this study is multiple linear regression analysis. After passing the data processing process that is processed in SPSS, the results of the study show that leverage affects audit delay, while profitability, audit opinion, and the reputation of public accounting firms do not significantly influence audit delay.

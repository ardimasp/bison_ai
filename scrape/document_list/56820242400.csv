And this sort of things happen in fashion design too, people need more than just a fancy and extravagant clothes and it becomes a new challenge for fashion designer to explore the design and combine it with the need of the future market. The idea on focusing on function as added value in fashion design has already emerged since the early Modernism in the early 60's. In Modernism, the beauty of aesthetic formulated based on function and material/structure exploration considered to be the future of effective design. But as time goes by, Modernism was considered to be rigid, dull and cliché, their beauty esthetic regarded as inhuman and less personal. The market demand seemed to be shifted to something more personal and have a “soul” in design, which later answered by Post Modernism that bloom in late 70's until today. So the question of how Modernism approached design, which in the beginning was actually based on human needs, technology, effectiveness and function to offer, have failed the market? How Postmodern with personal touch that less effective can answer the need of soul for humanist design in the future? But in the end are both Modernism and Post Modernism really an opposite?. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

For the Thousand Islands area, educational facilities are quite adequate, but the problem is that if you want to continue your education at the upper secondary level, students must stay on Pramuka Island, and incur additional costs. With the development of information systems and technology, making the industrial era 4.0 grow rapidly, so that and bring changes to the education sector with e-learning terminology that can provide solutions for regions in Indonesia that are still constrained in problems of access and distance so it is necessary to know the level of teacher readiness and students in schools in the Pramuka Island environment in the Thousand Islands in utilizing electronic learning. Quantitative research approaches are used and data collection uses a questionnaire with a likert scale with a population of all teachers and all school students who are on Pramuka Island, Thousand Islands. The research method uses the factor analysis method and the regression analysis method is used to build the model. The results showed the existence of ease of use e-learning application systems, rapid response from information technology support, and e-learning application systems that are easy to do if there is a change in learning material. © 2020 IEEE.","A thousand islands; E-learning implementation; Learning process; Student readiness level; Teacher readiness level","Computer aided instruction; Economic and social effects; Education computing; Engineering education; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Learning systems; Population statistics; Students; e-Learning application; Factor analysis method; Industrial revolutions; Information and Communication Technologies; Information systems and technologies; Information technology support; Quantitative research; Regression analysis methods; E-learning",,,,"Binus University","The author would like to thank BINUS University, Indonesia and the Community Service Internal Grant Program in 2020 which has funded the implementation of e-learning in schools in the Pramuka Island environment of the Thousand Islands - DKI Jakarta by building the initial prototype of this research","Luis Sánchez Garciá, J., Pérez Ruiz, S., Development of capabilities from the innovation of the perspective of poverty and disability (2017) Journal of Innovation & Knowledge, 2 (2), pp. 74-86. , May-August; Sardjono, W., Retnowardhani, A., Astari, Analysis of quality factors go-jek mobile application to increase company competitive advantage (2019) International Conference on Information Management and Technology (ICIMTech); Hussein, Z., Leading to intention: The role of attitude in relation to technology acceptance model in e-learning (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 105, pp. 159-164; Wu, R., Wu, Z., Wen, J., Cai, Y., Li, Y., Extrinsic and intrinsicmotivations as predictors of bicycle sharing usage intention: An empirical study for tianjin, China (2019) Journal of Cleaner Production, 225, pp. 451-458. , 10 July 2019; Vlastimir, N., Dalibor, P., Nebojša, D., Miloš, M., Snežana, G., Appraisal and review of e-learning and ICT systems in teaching process (2019) Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 5131, pp. 456-464. , January 2019; Ruth, W., Shirazi, S., A systematic review of audience response systems for teaching and learning in higher education: The student experience (2020) Computers & Education, 153; Schuster, L., Glavas, C., Exploring the dimensions of electronic work integrated learning (ewil) (2017) Educational Research Review, 21, pp. 55-66; Helen, C., Matthew, B., Greene, J.A., Psychological foundations of emerging technologies for teaching and learning in higher education (2020) Current Opinion in Psychology, 36, pp. 101-105; Hamidi, H., Chavoshi, A., Analysis of the essential factors for the adoption of mobile learning in higher education: A case study of students of the university of technology (2018) Telematics and Informatics, 35 (4), pp. 1053-1070. , July 2018; Sardjono, W., Readiness model of knowledge management systems implementation at the higher education (2020) ICIC Express Letters ICIC International, 14 (5), pp. 477-487. , May 2020",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","5th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2020","13 August 2020 through 14 August 2020",,163671,,9781728170718,,,"English","Proc.

The higher performance of the employee, the better the performance of the company as well. Furthermore to be able to establish key performance indicators, there are several steps that need to be done in order to obtain measurements that compatible with the conditions of the company. In this study, key performance indicator development process will be conducted through the stages of designing a questionnaire, distributing questionnaires to the employees of Company, performing factor analysis and then developing a model of KPI. The output of this study are new factors that affect employee performance and a model of KPI that can be used as a reference in forming a company's KPI. Once key performance indicators are formed, companies can take advantage of the knowledge management system for dissemination process of KPI. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Personnel rating; Surveys; Employee performance; Key performance indicators; Knowledge management system; Benchmarking",,,,,"Thank you to Bina Nusantara University for giving us the opportunity and support to conduct research.","Braam, J., Nijssen, E., Performance effects of using the balanced scorecard: A note on the dutch experience (2004) Long Range Planning, 37 (4), p. 335; Cardinaels, E., Veen-Dirks, P., Financial versus non-financial i nformation: The impact of information organization and presentation in a balanced scorecard (2010) Accounting, Organizations and Society, 35 (6), p. 565; Farooq, A., Hussain, Z., Balanced scorecard perspective on change and performance: A study of selected indian companies (2011) Procedia-social and Behavioral Sciences, 24, p. 754; Marc, J., The integrated scorecard in support of corporate sustainability strategies (2016) Journal of Environmental Management, 182, p. 214; Arredondo, S., Realyvasquez, V., Maldonado, M., García, A., Impact of human resources on remanufacturing process, internal complexity, perceived quality of core, numerosity, and key process indicators (2019) Robotics and Computer-integrated Manufacturing, 59, p. 168; Robert, S.K., Conceptual Foundations of the Balanced Scorecard (2009) Handbooks of Management Accounting Research, 3, p. 1253; Joanna, R., Interrelation between strategy maps and other implementation tools and actions (2015) Procedia-social and Behavioral Sciences, 210, p. 58; John, D.T., The balanced scorecard: Translating strategy into action: By Robert S.

The goal also consist upon the moderating role of effectiveness of supply chain on the links of AIS and effective energy consumption, intensity of energy and effective energy consumption. The employees that are related with AIS and supply chain are the respondent and they provide the data by questionnaires and the data was evaluated by employing the effective tool of data analysis named as Smart-PLS. The results show that AIS and intensity of energy have positive link with the effective energy consumption. The findings also show that effectiveness of supply chain positively moderates among the links of AIS and effective energy consumption, intensity of energy and effective energy consumption.

Data collection techniques used were interviews, observation, documentation, literature study. The results of this study indicate that small and medium micro businesses in Indonesia still use manual cash receipt accounting information systems. Documents used in the form of cash notes and invoices, while the notes made are records of ca sh sales, accounts receivable, and inve ntory.

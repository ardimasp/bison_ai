In Indonesia, people cannot track the electricity home use since PLN bills only display total price. Currently, people cannot control devices (turn on/off) from outside of the house, which if possible, will lead to electricity savings. Interviews, literature research and experiments have been conducted to develop the prototype of the system. For the hardware; Arduino Board and Current Transformator are used to capture the data about electricity consumption in every room in the house. Meanwhile, an online application is designed using PHP in cloud platform. After receiving the data, it will be sent to the cloud server so that the user can see the report in the form of chart and graph for each room through a laptop or computer with Internet access. Switching on and switching off a lamp in the house can also be controlled through either Android mobile application or computer. This feature is expected to give a smarter way for the users to monitor and control their electricity consumption at home. The software has been tested in a small prototype house, which consists of 1 or 2 rooms that may have one lamp, TV, AC, and desktop computer or anything similar to it.","Arduino for home automation; Cloud monitoring application; Energy saving application; Mobile control application","Competition; Electronic document exchange; Information management; Software testing; Cloud monitoring; Electricity-consumption; Home automation; Information society; Literature researches; Mobile controls; Monitor and control; On-line applications; Houses",,,,,"Azwar, A.S., Businesses ready to raise prices as electricity costs rocket (2012), http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/12/29/businesses-ready-raise-prices-electricity-costsrocket.html, 29 December, Retrieved from; Dhany, R.R., Waduh!

The main function of the application is to search restaurant information. Other functions are also available in this application such as add restaurant, add promotion, add photo, add food review, and other features including social networking features. The restaurant and promotion searching application will be developed under Android platform. Upon completion of this paper, heuristic evaluation and usability testing have been conducted. The result of both testing shows that the application is highly usable. Even though there are some usability problems discovered, the problems can be eliminated immediately by implementing the recommendations from the expert evaluators and the users as the testers of the application. Further improvement made to the application will ensure that the application can really be beneficial for the users of the application. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.","Digital dashboard management; DSS; Model; Simulation; System dynamic",,,,,,"Erry, (2012) Jumlah Smartphone di Indonesia Meningkat 460 Persen; Einhorn, B., (2012) Indonesians Still Love Their BlackBerrys; Vere, K., (2012) Tracking Growth: The ITunes App Store Vs Google Play; (2012) Apple Adds 'Food & Drink' Section to App Store; Dancy, J., (2012) Dine and Dish: Are Social Media and Food the Perfect Pairing; Alana, K., (2012) Instagram & Co.: The Mobile Era of Food Photography; Cogert, M., Mobile Website or Mobile App: Advantages and Disadvantages of Both; What Is An App Store?; (2012) Apple Adds 'Food & Drink' Section to App Store; Brandau, M., (2012) Study: Restaurant Strategies Differ for Smartphone, Tablet Apps; Virrantaus, K., Markkula, J., Garmash, A., Terziyan, Y., Developing GIS-supported location- based services (2001) Proc. of WGIS'2001, pp. 423-432; Steiniger, S., Neun, M., Edwardes, A., Foundations of Location Based Services; Boyd, D.M., Ellison, N.B., Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship, 13, p. 1; (2013) Facebook Statistics by Countries; Hadiwiyana, O., (2012) Beberapa Data Internet, Social Media, Mobile di Indonesia; Zheng, Y., Location-based social networks: Users (2011) Computing with Spatial Trajectories, , Eds.

The research aims to analyze brand position of top six e-commerce platform (Tokopedia, Shopee, Bukalapak, Lazada, BliBli and JD.ID) within consumers in Two cities in Indonesia, Jakarta Tangerang. Products attributes were gathered through literature review and brainstorming. Factor analysis were then used to reduce consumers' attributes into 4 dimensions, i.e. E-commerce Capability, Customer Service, Value for Money, and Product Offering. Six perpetual maps were then created using Multi-dimensional scaling to analyze top six brands on those dimensions. Results shows that Tokopedia and Shopee are superior in E-commerce Capability, whilst sharing similar positioning in term of Value for Money and Product Offering. BliBli is perceived to be superior in Customer Service and can capitalize this dimension as their differentiation strategy. © 2020 IEEE.","Brand positioning; Factor analysis; Multidimensional scaling; Perpetual map","Electronic commerce; Information management; Multivariant analysis; Brand position; Customer services; Differentiation strategies; Integrating factor; Literature reviews; Multi-dimensional scaling; Product offerings; Value for monies; Factor analysis",,,,,"Najafizadeh, N.S., Elahi, A.M., Moemeni, L.Z., A model for brand positioning of hygienic products using the most effective factors on competitive position and perceptual map technique (2012) African J.

The era of the industrial revolution 4.0 has also changed the way people view edu-cation. Changes made are not only ways of teaching, but are far more essential, namely changes in perspective on the concept of education itself. Likewise, what happens in the world of higher education, knowledge management systems have become a tool or facility to support the learning process. The next problem that often occurs in optimizing the implementation of knowledge management systems is how to measure the level of com-munity readiness in its implementation. Research related to the readiness of the higher education community in anticipating the industrial revolution in era 4.0 was developed based on the SECI model theory (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, and Inter-nalization) and factor analysis theory, and can be used to analyze community readiness in utilizing knowledge management systems with the substance of the learning process so that results can be achieved. The results of the study were in the form of Knowledge Man-agement System (KMS) readiness model related to the substance of the desired knowledge to support the socialization and internalization of students in higher education inuenced by the Lack of Knowledge Utilization, Knowledge Information, Knowledge Sharing Qual-ity, and Network Distribution, which can be simulated and optimized for the development of future implementation strategies. © 2020 ICIC International.

The research focuses on conception, design, implementation and evaluation of the learning object management hypermedia API. The hypermedia API was designed based on learning object models, hypermedia concepts, and related studies. Learning object model can be represented and manipulated as a hypermedia resource. It contains page resources with text and links to multimedia elements. The hypermedia API was designed using UML and represented in HTML5 because of its rich affordance. The implementation and evaluation phase were conducted by testing the API using three different client's software to prove the concept of hypermedia as the engine of application state for managing learning objects. The results show that the hypermedia API for learning object management is accessible, consistent, and discoverable by heterogonous client applications. © 2018 The Authors.

The development of this system is motivated due to the fact that the students' attendance records are one of the important elements that reflect their academic achievements. However, the current manual practice implemented is causing such a hassle. Empowering the usage of the new RFID based student card, a new web based-attendance system has been built to cater the recording and reporting of not just the student's' attendances, but also the lecturer's and taught topics in the class. The development of this system is inspired by the senior management. And the system can be easily accessed through the learning management system and can generate a report in real time, This paper will discuss in details the development until the maintaining phase of the system. Result achieved is the innovation of developing the system proved reliable to support related business processes and empowered the intention to maximize the usage of the RFID card. Considered as a successful implementation, this paper will give an input for others who want to implement a similar system. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,"(2013), http://web.binus.edu/binusiancard/About.BINUSIAN.Card-Flazz/English, Accessed 4 July; Caviglia Harris, J.L., Attendance and achievement in economics: Investigating the impact of attendance policies and absentee rates on student performance (2006) Journal of Economics and Finance Education, 4 (2); Lim, T.S., Sim, S.C., Mansor, M.M., Industrial electronic & applications (2009) IEEE Symposium on, 2, pp. 778-782; Tabassam, N., Pervaiz, S., Korrani, A., Azhar-Ud-Din, Development of academic attendance monitoring system using fingerprint identification (2009) International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, 9 (5), pp. 164-168; Balcoh, N.K., Yousaf, M.H., Ahmad, W., Baig, M.I., Algorithm for efficient attendance management: Face recognition based approach (2012) JCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, 9 (1-4); Hodges, S., McFarlane, D., (2005) Radio Frequency Identification: Technology, Application and Impact, , Whitepaper, AutoID Labs, Cambridge; Patel, R., Patel, N., Gajjar, M., Online students' attendance monitoring system in classroom using radio frequency identification technology: A proposed system framework (2012) International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering, 2 (2). , ISSN 2250-2459; Singhal, Z., Gujral, R.K., Anytime anywhere-remote monitoring of attendance system bcase on RFID using GSM network (2012) International Journal of Computer Applications, 39 (3). , 0975-8887; McFarlane, D., Sheffi, Y., The impact of automatic identification on supply chain operations (2003) The Int J Logist Manag, 1, pp. 14-17. , Doi: 10.1108/09574090310806503; (2003) The IT Revolution: The Best Thing since the Barcode, 51. , The Economist; Ustundag, A., Kilinc, M.S., Cevikcan, E., Fuzzy rule-based system for the economic analysis of RFID investments (2010) Expert Syst Appl, 37 (7), pp. 5300-5306. , doi: 10.1016/j.eswa.2010.01.009; Ustundag, A., (2013) The Value of RFID: Benefit Vs.

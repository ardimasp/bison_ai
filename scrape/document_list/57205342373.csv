Penghayat Kepercayaan is a name for non-religious society or some people called as Agama Asli Nusantara. Becoming Penghayat will face some special challenges since the society generally has negative stereotype towards them. The research method used was qualitative by using emic approach. The subject of this research was Penghayat Kepercayaan (the believers) who was covered by Majelis Luhur Kepercayaan Terhadap Tuhan YME Indonesia (MLKI). The informants were determined by using purposive sampling technique. The research finding was the democratic country generally considered the diversity and all citizens have the similar rights and obligations, however, until now, Penghayat Kepercayaan is struggling to get the acceptance especially for their identities. The new problem about the existence of Penghayat Kepercayaan in the social interaction will evoke their feelings of useless in actualizing their life and their occupations. The perspective towards the democracy of Pancasila by some Penghayat Kepercayaan did not represent enough their existence as the diversity in Indonesia, while for others, this current democracy had already fulfilled their needs. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.","Agama Asli Nusantara; Democracy; Emic; Penghayat Kepercayaan Indonesia; Religion","Information systems; Agama Asli Nusantara; Democracy; Emic; Indonesia; Religion; Information use",,,,,,"Hernandi, A., Eksistensi, organisasi, dan kehidupan penghayat kepercayaan terhadap tuhan yang maha esa (2014) Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Bandung Direktorat Jenderal Nilai Budaya, Seni, Dan Film Kementrian Pendidikan Dan Kebudayaan; Hernandi, A., Upaya revitalisasi nilai ajaran kepercayaan terhadap tuhan yang maha esa (2007) Gelar Budaya Direktorat Jenderal Nilai Budaya, Seni Dan Film, Departemen Kebudayaan Dan Pariwisata; Giri, W., (2002) Sajen Dan Ritual Orang Jawa, 1. , Narasi, Jakarta; Harahap, I., Rasionalisasi religius dalam diskursus keagamaan di Indonesia: Kasus parmalim batak toba (2014) Antropologi Indonesia, (61). , http://iournal.ui.ac.id, Retrieved October 12, 2017; (2001) Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, , http://Portal.Unesco.Org, UNESCO, Paris, on October 5, 2017; Undang Undang No. 23 Tahun 2006 Tentang Administrasi Kependudukan; Punnett, B.J.F., The emic-etic-emic research circle (2017) AIB Insights, 17 (1). , Michigan University; Cheung, F.M., Toward a new approach to the study of personality in culture (2011) American Psychologist, , United States; (2017) Sejarah MLKI, , http://www.mlki.or.id, MLKI, on October 18, 2017; Undang Undang Dasar 1945; Lubis, R.M., Kebijakan pembangunan agama di Indonesia dalam lintasan sejarah (2010) Harmoni Jurnal Multikultural & Multireligius, 9 (34). , April-Juni, Puslitbang Kehidupan Keagamaan Badan Litbang & Diklat Kementerian Agama RI, Jakarta; (2017) Hakim Konstitusi: Aliran Kepercayaan Ada Sebelum Agama Datang, , https://news.detik.com, Detik. com, on 7 October 2017; Ruswana, E., Eksistensi, organisasi, dan kehidupan penghayat kepercayaan terhadap tuhan yang maha esa (2014) Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Direktorat Jenderal Nilai Budaya, Seni, Dan Film Kementerian Pendidikan Dan Kebudayaan RI, Bandung; Meisenberg, G., (2007) Does Multiculturalism Promote Income Inequality, 47 (4), pp. 3-39. , https://search.proquest.com, Mankind Quarterly, on October 12, 2017; Hakiki, K., Politik identitas agama lokal (studi kasus aliran kebatinan) (2017) Analisis: Jurnal Studi Keislaman, 11 (1), pp. 159-174; Mahestu, G., (2012) Thesis Dunia Intersubjektif Warga Penghayat Aliran Kebatinan Perjalanan, , Universitas Padiaiaran, Bandung; Syafi'I, M.A., (2010) Kebijakan Pembangunan Agama di Indonesia Dalam Lintasan Sejarah.

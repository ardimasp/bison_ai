Employees need a way to attain proper education with some degree of flexibility and a practical solution to this problem is Online University. The purpose of this study is to further investigate the factors that can influence purchase intention for Online Universities. Two factors studied in this research are Brand Image and Price Perception with Brand Trust as a Mediator. Data for this research was collected from 400 respondents in South Sumatera specifically Palembang and the object of this research is associated with Online University specifically Binus Online Learning, a popular university in the region of the study. The data collected was analyzed with Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The results show that there is a positive relationship between Brand Image and Price Perception towards Purchase Intention, Brand Trust is also proven to mediate the relationship between these variables. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Brand Image; Brand Trust; Online University; Price Perception; Purchase Intention",,,,,,"Akbariyeh, H., Mirabi, D., Tahmasebifard, H., A study of factors affecting on customers purchase intention case study: The agencies of bono brand tile in Tehran (2015) Journal of Multidisciplinary Engineering Science and Technology, 2 (1), pp. 267-273; Alhaddad, A., A structural model of the relationships between brand image, brand trust and brand loyalty (2015) International Journal of Management Research & Review, 5 (3), pp. 137-144; Athapaththu, J.

One of the biological factors from water quality is the life of macro benthos organisms. In some existing studies macro benthos is usually used as a bioindicator of water quality. The presence of a specific macro benthos family or macro benthos organism that has similarities in the aquatic environment signifies the water quality level. Such extreme environmental changes provide a macro benthos life tolerance value called the Biotic Factor Index (BFI). The purpose of this publication is Knowing the relationship between the biotic index and water quality, SQL syntax to calculate the Biotic Index from the input of each sampling point, the design of the system that accommodates each macro benthos findings from each sampling point in a water. The biotic value from spring to autumn is 2.59, 2.68, 3.22, 3.42, all of them is in very good water quality. © 2018 IEEE.","biotic family index; design system analyze; macro benthos; water quality","Aquatic ecosystems; Aquatic organisms; Information management; Water quality; Aquatic environments; Biological factors; biotic family index; Design systems; Environmental change; Household activities; Macro benthos; Production activity; Potable water",,,,,"Mandaville, S.M., Benthic macroinvertebrates in freshwaters-Taxa tolerance values, metrics, and protocols (2002) Soil Water Conserv.

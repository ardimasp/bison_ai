The most important aspects of the high-rise buildings is energy saving technology located in the building envelope design. Building envelope with a full glass design functions for widening view and enhancing natural lights, even though but it is also increasing energy consumption and thermal discomfort due to the intensity of solar radiation in hot humid climates. During the current decade, the development of double building envelope type (Double Skin Façade: DSF) seemed more just to improve the aesthetics and the use of natural light, while the wind and thermal performance aspects were still lack of serious consideration. Those aspects will be chosen as the subject matter in this research. The research was aimed to investigate and compare the value of heat transfer in the building envelope of high-rise office buildings. Samples were taken from five DSF buildings, with closed and open cavity. CFD software is used for simulation of the five different models of DSF. The research proves that the high-rise office buildings as the research object in Jakarta do not apply energy conservation principle. The utilization of wind in the DSF cavity can reduce temperature and relieve the burden of air conditioning systems that is energy save. An important finding of the research is the need for ventilation in the design of a double skin at high-rise office buildings in the humid tropics. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","CFD; DSF; Office building; Wind","Building envelope design; Building envelopes; Double-skin facades; DSF; Energy conservation principle; Energy-saving technologies; High-rise office buildings; Thermal Performance; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer simulation; Computer software; Design; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Facades; Research; Solar buildings; Sun; Tall buildings; Wind; Office buildings",,,,,"Balocco, C., (2009) Transient Simulation of a Naturally Ventilated Façade In a Mediterranean Climate, , Proceedings of the COMSOL Conference, Milan; Baldinelli, G., Double skin façades for warm climate regions: Analysis of a solution with an integrated movable shading system (2009) Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Perugia Building Environment, 44 (6), pp. 1107-1118; (2012) Daryanto, Comparative Study of Heat Transfer In a Double Skin Facades On High-Rise Office Building In Jakarta, , .

There are many methods and techniques that can be used to achieve this goal through energy efficiency for building envelope in the tropic area. The use of glass material becomes one of the alternatives that offer a more attractive appearance. Although the double skin facades (DSF) has been widely applied, but research on the thermal performance and behavior of the wind is still scarce for the tropics, so it is interesting to note related to energy conservation. To obtain a clear picture of the heat transfer and airflow, the research was conducted on the two office buildings with the same orientation and location but they were different on the building envelope. The study was conducted by the field measurements and simulation using CFD-ACE + software, to determine the performance of the heat transfer and behavior of airflow in the double skin facades. The results indicate that the role of wind on the design building envelope has an influence on the heat transfer and energy savings. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","CFD; Double skin facade; Energy; Heat transfer; Wind","Building envelopes; CFD-ACE+; Comparative studies; Double-skin facades; Energy; Field measurement; Glass materials; Jakarta; Thermal Performance; Building materials; Civil engineering; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer software; Energy efficiency; Facades; Glass; Office buildings; Solar buildings; Tropics; Wind; Heat transfer",,,,,"Prasetya, A., (2011) Performance of Ventilated Double Skin Façade on High Rise Building in Hot Humid Climate; Pappas, A., (2007) Numerical Investigation on Thermal Performance and Correlations of Double Skin Façade with Buoyancy-Driven Airflow, , Department of Civil, University of Colorado; Daryanto, (1989) A Study on Energy Control Using the Building Envelope on High-rise Office Building in Jakarta, , Thesis S2 Department of Architecture ITB- Bandung; Nasution, H., (2006) Energy Conservation in Building, , www.he4si.com; Oesterlee, Lieb, R.-D., Lutz, M., (2001) Double Skin Facades - Integrated Planning, , Prestel Verlag: Munich, Germany","Daryanto; Department of Architecture, , Jakarta, Indonesia; email: daryanto@binus.edu",,,,"2nd International Conference on Civil Engineering, Architecture and Building Materials, CEABM 2012","25 May 2012 through 27 May 2012","Yantai",90003,16609336,9783037854228,,,"English","Appl.

The reporting system commonly used utilizes query which consumes a large amount of time in order to generate results fulfilling requirements set by the user. In order to simplify and speed up reporting in digital world and eventually results in improvement of business, the business entity needs a system which can address problems quickly and easily. In this paper, data warehouse system which could simplify and speed up the reporting provisions that is needed by the business without having to modify the existing query being implemented. With Kimball approaches, the data to be reported could be customized in various forms in accordance with the requirements set by the entity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Rizzi, S., From star schemas to big data: 20+ years of data warehouse research (2018) J.

Speech processing has becoming more popular and inspiring expanses lately in signal processing area. It is because speech is one of the most natural form of human communication. However, in processing speech signals intrinsically show many variations even without background noise. Two different person can produce different spectrograms when saying the same sentence. Dialect or Accent is one of the most important factors that can influence the Automatic Speech Recognition or ASR performance besides gender (Unsupervised accent class). Many researches show that dialect or accent in speech can significantly affect the speech system performance. Various methods have been used to increase the accuracy of ASR with accent detection, accent identification, and accent classification. Fused i-vector and Phonotactic are the latest technique that shows a significant degree of accuracy. The purpose of this paper is to briefly survey on accent detection, accent identification, and accent classification and discuss the major improvements made in the past almost 10 years of research. © BEIESP.","Accent classification; Accent detection; Accent identification; Speech recognition",,,,,,"Najafian, M., Safavi, S., Weber, P., Russell, M., Identification of British English regional accents using fusion of i-vector and multi-accent phonotactic system (2016) Odyssey, pp. 132-139; Hansen, J.H.L., Liu, G., Unsupervised accent classification for deep data fusion of acoustic and language information (2016) Elsevier, 78 (2015), pp. 19-33; Sastry, P.N., (2015) Accent Detection of Telugu Speech Using Prosodic and Formant Features, pp. 318-322; Yu, D., Deng, L., (2015) Automatic Speech Recognition a Deep Learning Approach, , Springer; Lacheret-Dujour, A.-C.S., Goldman, J.-P., Lacheret-Dujour, A., Simon, A.-C., Goldman, J.-P., Prominence, M.A., (2014) Prominence Perception and Accent Detection in French: From Phonetic Processing to Grammatical Analysis, (39), pp. 95-106; Kamper, H., Niesler, T., The impact of accent identification errors on speech recognition of South African English Accents of English in South Africa (2014) South African Journal of Science, 110 (1), pp. 1-6; Lazaridis, J.-P.G., Avanzi, M., Syllable-based Regional Swiss French Accent Identification using Prosodic Features (2014) Nouveaux Cahiers De Linguistique Francaise, 1 (2000), pp. 1-2; Avanzi, M., Garner, P.N., Swiss french regional accent identification (2014) In Odyssey: The Speaker and Language Recognition Workshop; Bahari, M.H., Saedi, R., Hamme, H.V., Leeuwen, D.V., Accent Recognition using i-Vector, Gaussian Meana Supervector and Gaussian posterior probability Supervector for spontaneous Telephone Speech (2013) IEEE, No. October, pp. 7344-7348; Safavi, S., Hanani, A., Russell, M., Jan, P., Carey, M.J., Contrasting the Effects of Different Frequency Bands on Speaker and Accent Identi fi cation (2012) IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 19 (12), pp. 829-832; De, M., Cox, S.J., Iterative Classification of Regional British Accents in i-Vector space (2012) Machine Learning in Speech and Language Processing (MLSLP), 2012, pp. 1-4. , September; Tan, Y.Y., Age as a factor in ethnic accent identification in Singapore (2012) Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 33 (2014), pp. 37-41; Sam, S., Xiao, X., Besacier, L., Castelli, E., Li, H., Chng, E.S., Bp, U.M.R.C., Cedex, G., (2011) Speech Modulation Features for Robust Nonnative Speech Accent Detection School of Computer Engineering, pp. 2417-2420. , Nanyang Technological University, Singapore Department of Human Language Technology, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore Temasek Lab @ NTU,,"" Interspeech; Hansen, J.H.L., Gray, S.S., Kim, W., Automatic voice onset time detection for unvoiced stops (/ p /,/ t /,/ k /) with application to accent classification (2010) Speech Communication, 52 (10), pp. 777-789; Auzou, P., Ozsancak, C., Morris, R.J., Jan, M., Eustache, F., Hannequin, D., Voice onset time in aphasia, apraxia of speech and dysarthria: A review Voice onset time in aphasia, apraxia of speech and dysarthria: A review (2009) Clinical Linguistics & Phonetics, 14, pp. 131-150; Wu, T., Duchateau, J., Martens, J.-P., Compernolle, D.V., Feature subset selection for improved native accent identification (2009) Speech Communication, 52, pp. 83-98; Zheng, Y., Sproat, R., Gu, L., Shafran, I., Zhou, H., Su, Y., Jurafsky, D., Yoon, S.-Y., Accent Detection and Speech Recognition for Shanghai-Accented Mandarin (2005) In NTERSPEECH, p. 2005. , Lisbon",,,,"Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication",,,,,22773878,,,,"English","Int.

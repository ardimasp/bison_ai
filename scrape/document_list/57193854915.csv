The Internet has also fundamentally changed the paradigm of today's business communications, altered the way in which information is shared, and set an enormous influence on marketing strategy. There are prior studies on the relationship between leadership type and new technology adoption, as well as dynamic capability and new technology adoption. Most of these studies have confirmed that there is a significant correlation between both transformational and dynamic capabilities to new technology adoption, of which most emphasized the adoption of the Internet or e-commerce. While previous studies have confirmed the relationship amongst those variables, this paper investigates empirically in one cohesive research model on the relationship between transformational leadership and digital marketing adoption, dynamic capability and digital marketing adoption, and dynamic capability as a mediating variable on the relationship between transformational leadership and digital marketing adoption. Furthermore, this research uniquely studies consumer shopping goods in the context of Indonesia. The survey was undertaken in Greater Jakarta, Indonesia, with 215 firms in the field of consumer shopping goods. The outcome reveals that there is a direct impact of dynamic capability to digital marketing adoption, but to the contrary, there is an indirect impact between transformational leadership and digital marketing adoption. This study also finds that the relationship between transformational leadership and digital marketing adoption is fully mediated by the dynamic capability of the firms. © 2017 Universita Putra Malaysia.","Digital marketing; Dynamic capability; Technology acceptance; Transformational leadership",,,,,,"Al-Qirim, N., 'An Empirical Investigation of An E-Commerce Adoption-Capability Model in Small Businesses in New Zealand' (2005) Journal Routledge Electronic Markets, 15 (4), pp. 418-437; Amit, S., 'Strategic Asset and Organizational Rent' (1993) Strategic Management Journal, 14 (4), pp. 33-46. , Corporate Change, Vol. 3, No. 3, pp. 557-605. 22; Arthur, W.B., 'Increasing Returns and the New World of Business and the Two Worlds of Business' (1996) Harvard Business Review, pp. 1-10; Barlon, K., 'The concept of the marketing mix' (2006) Presentation on marketing management, vol, 1, pp. 2-7. , September, 2006-Oulu University-Finland; Barreto, I., 'Dynamic Capabilities: A Review of Past Research and an Agenda for the Future' (2010) Journal of Management, 36 (1), pp. 256-280; Bass, B.M., (1985) 'Leadership and Performance Beyond Expectations', , New York: Free Press; Bass, B.M., Waldman, D.A., Avolio, B.J., Bebb, M., 'Transformational Leadership and the Falling Dominoes Effect' (1987) Group and Organization Studies, 12, pp. 73-78; Bass, B.M., Avolio, B.J., (1994) 'Improving organizational effectiveness through transformational leadership', , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Booms, B.H., Bitner, B.J., 'Marketing strategies and organization structures for service firms (1980) Marketing of services, pp. 47-51. , In Donnelly, J. & George W.

By innovating the business model as the result of the use of the internet, the firms can also stay ahead of the competition. Recently, internet marketing has fundamentally changed the paradigm of the business, altered the way in which information is shared and communicate to consumers and set an enormous influence on strategy and business model. To respond these changes, businesses need to have the capabilities to integrate, build and reconfigure internal and external competences or to create, extend or modify its resource base, i.e., organization dynamic capability. There are prior studies on the relationship between dynamic capability and business model innovation and dynamic capability and new technology adoption as well as new technology adoption and business model innovation. Most of these studies confirmed that there is a significance correlation amongst these variables of which some of them emphasize on the adoption to the internet or e-Commerce. This study investigates empirically in one integrated research model on the relationship between mentioned variables in internet marketing context. The survey was undertaken in Greater Jakarta, Indonesia to 215 firms in the field of consumer shopping goods. The outcome reveals that there is a direct impact of dynamic capability to internet marketing adoption, dynamic capability and business model innovation and internet marketing adoption to business model innovation.

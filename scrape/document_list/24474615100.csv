The Online Examination System is implemented in all branches of the Open University in major cities in Indonesia. The Amount of Interest Students make UT need to predict how much interest is the registration of SUO, so that UT can prepare facilities and infrastructure so that the exam can run smoothly. Regression is a method that can be used in analyzing predictions, several regression models such as Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Regression and Artificial Neural Network are used in this study. In addition to obtaining accurate predictions, in machine learning a feature selection is added to eliminate unrelated data and also duplicate data. Cities were grouped using the K-Means method. Decision tree model without feature selection has good performance with RMSE = 169.047 +/-0.000 and R2 = 0.749. And for the ANN model combined with optimize selection (evolutionary) it has a good performance value of RMSE = 115.023 +/-38,183 (micro average: 120,592 +/-0.000) and R2 = 0.841 + /-0.082 (micro average: 0.824) with several attributes related to the prediction process. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Smart School is one of the concepts of IoT and is also a solution for education for student monitoring problems. In this study, student monitoring is proposed using an IP-based CCTV system with the ability to detect and recognize people. With the support of the use of beacon chips as student identity, the system can simplify problems of face identification to face verification. The use of fingerprinting techniques is a general technique used to determine the position of objects when using beacon chips based on transmitter signals so that the position of a student's face can be determined based on the user's position. The face verification process is then carried out by combining fingerprinting techniques and facial recognition captured by CCTV cameras with a face comparison method of OpenFace. Experimental results show that the proposed system provides good accuracy on student monitoring for smart school applications. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Until now, malware detection with heuristic and signature-based methods are still struggling to keep up with the evolution of malware. Machine learning is known to be able to automate the work needed to detect families of existing and newly discovered malware. Unfortunately, the machine learning method using Support Vector Machine (SVM) for detecting malware can only reach a low level of accuracy. In this work, we propose a dynamic analysis method and uses a system call sequence to monitor malware behavior. It uses the word2vec technique as word embedding and implements deep learning models, namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Nested LSTM, as classifiers. To compare with existing machine learning approach, we also apply the Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a benchmark method. The Nested LSTM gets an accuracy of 93.11%, while the LSTM gets the best accuracy of 98.61%. The LSTM also achieved the best performance in terms of average precision at 97.57%, the average recall at 97.29%, and the average score of f1 at 97.43%. We have found that our model is lightweight but powerful for detecting malware with significant accuracy. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Positioning which is widely used and can work very well outdoors is to use GPS (Global Positioning System). However, GPS cannot run well indoors because of many obstacles in a building. The study was conducted with the topic ""indoor positioning system"". This research using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) technology because it consumes the least energy and can last a very long time. The focus of this research is to use a combination of trilateration and fingerprinting methods to improve accuracy performance. The first stage determines the reference point and forms a radio map. The second stage consists of estimation using the trilateration method. The log distance path loss model/Log-normal shadowing model was used for the propagation model. The evaluation of the proposed method is in a room with a size of 21m x 12 m, 100 sample data for each reference point, and 10 sample data for each test point. Error performance is evaluated using average error, min error, max error, median and 90th percentile. The results of this study if compared with results that only use the trilateration method show that the proposed hybrid method has better accuracy performance and fewer errors rate. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Nowadays, schools are relying on Management Information System (MIS) to handle operations. In this paper we propose to design SMIS architecture capable of serve multiple schools by using Representational State Transfer (REST) as architectural style. Case study, REST constraint and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) design pattern is being used to design the architecture. From the design process, multitenant architecture is chosen. Kubernetes is chosen as deployment orchestration to make architecture scalable. Then we examine and evaluate engineering trade-off and risks in architectures design decision by using Architecture Trade-off Analysis Method (ATAM). The evaluation is based on scenarios and each scenario related to several software quality attributes. At the end, the architecture implementation is improved overtime based on the evaluation result. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The study was conducted using a dataset consisting of 38 different classes of PlantVillage dataset, which were then expanded using 2 classes of coffee plants and 4 classes of rice plants. The models that are going to be tested and compared consists of MobileNet V2, NasNet Mobile, DenseNet 121 layer, and InceptionV3. In the experiments, it was found that there was a decrease in accuracy when the application was run on a mobile device when compared to when it was run on a PC. Experiments also show that InceptionV3 is the most stable model and reaches the highest level of accuracy, which is 98.45% on mobile devices. However, InceptionV3 consumes a lot of resources when used on mobile devices. Meanwhile, MobileNet V2, NasNet Mobile, dan DenseNet 121, do not consume a lot of resources when tested on mobile devices. In terms of accuracy, NasNet Mobile reached 97.31%, then MobileNet V2 reached 96.55%, and DenseNet 121 reached 96.21%. Based on the research criteria, it can be concluded that the CNN model that is most suitable to be used on mobile devices is NasNet Mobile. Because it has a high degree of accuracy with low resource consumption. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

It is possible to be used in many applications such as visual search, information retrieval and augmented reality. However, various things affect the appearance of the objects, which makes the recognition process harder, especially if a single reference image is used. In this paper, we proposed a combination method between Salient Object Detection and Object Instance Recognition using Image Matching and Geometric Verification. Salient Object Detection is used during initial processing (feature extraction), while Geometric Verification is performed using Best Score Increasing Subsequence (BSIS). Experimental results showed that the Fβ score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of saliency map on Stanford Mobile Visual Search Dataset (SMVS) are quite satisfactory. While the results of the combination method show 1.92% performance improvement than the previous method which is BSIS without Salient Object Detection. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

One of those is the concept of a smart city, where architects are racing to design the most functional and aesthetically pleasing buildings. This circumstance poses a threat where bigger buildings, means a bigger chance of people getting lost inside a building. Unlike outdoors where we got GPS to help locate our position in this world. Inside a building GPS signals tend to be heavily interfered, thus making it unreliable. This paper proposes cloud-based indoor positioning service, that can be implemented for indoor navigation system. The service uses an android device to pick up the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and send it to the server to transform it from (X, Y) points obtained by fingerprinting techniques into a global coordinate based on 2D-to-2D transformation matrix. We used 21 x 10 meters of room for the testing. The result suggest that this kind of technique is doable, and it reports good availability with the trade-off of response time and throughput at higher request counts. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

This technology mainly used because of the reduction of material and energy cost over time that has huge impact compared to other technology which are more costly. Most Recent Research has solved the problem of inconsistency on Received Signal Strength (RSS) using fingerprint method. But the RSS that received may contain some noise. This paper mainly proposed a method to estimate or tracking the real position of dynamic user. With RSS value as input to be processed and the result of it will be a location (x, y) value, then repeat the process to create an estimate coordinate map of route taken. Our proposed method is based on fingerprinting with weighted sum of five nearest reference point to estimate the position of dynamic user then using Extended Kalman Filter as a tracking algorithm. In this paper we try new ways to collect the data of RSS by dynamically collecting the data in many routes to see whether the proposed algorithm could estimate the position better. We achieve an average mean of error around 302,42 cm using Weighted Sum + Extended Kalman Filter tested on dynamic data. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Without the correct area of the face to be detected and recognized, then implemented face recognition can be inefficient and wasting the valuable areas that can be useful as inputs in face recognition networks. Therefore, there are many types of research in this topic using various face dataset benchmark like tested on FDDB and WIDER Face. WIDER Face offering a challenging dataset with various of the pose, scale, occlusion along with many annotated tiny faces. In this WIDER Face benchmark, S3FD offering a faster detector with relatively good accuracy inspired by anchor-based SSD and RPN where the top accuracy detectors in WIDER Face implemented using Region-based CNN. Region-based DSFD offering good accuracy and listed on top-accuracy detectors, but unable counted as a real-time detector in our testing process. In this paper, we propose a faster face detector model with relatively good accuracy in the WIDER Face benchmark using optimized 9 clusters of anchor boxes in the Yolov3 framework. These anchor boxes are optimized using K-Mean clustering from the WIDER Face training dataset in order to make better-matched anchor boxes during the training-validation process to detect various faces, especially for tiny faces. This paper shows relatively good competitiveness of our Yolov3 face detector model in terms of accuracy and speed on the WIDER Face datasets benchmark. We also tested our model in a real-case situation for detecting students inside the classroom and show the capability of real-time face detector with correct face detections during the real case implementation. © 2019 SERSC.","Convolutional neural networks; Real-case face detection; Real-time face detector; Wider face dataset; Yolov3",,,,,"Binus University","The authors wish to thank Bina Nusantara University to support this paper publication.

In the fine-tuning step, Delta rule is used to update the coordinates of reference points based on the wireless environment represented in the training dataset. The combination of the coarse estimation and the proposed fine-tuning makes the coarse-to-fine algorithm. The algorithms used for coarse estimation are weighted sum and k-nearest neighbour, with three weight calculation algorithms that are compared in this experiment: Minkowski distance, k-means Gaussian mixture model, and autoencoder. Two subject rooms are used in order to measure the performance of the algorithms. The experiment showed that the fine-tuning algorithm improves the accuracy of the positioning throughout all combination of methods in both rooms, which shows its versatility. It reduces the mean positioning error by up to 11.3% and depends on what algorithm used in the weight calculation. Another benefit from the fine-tuning model is that it does not increase the complexity of the algorithm in the online phase. Overall, the best result is achieved by the combination of weighted sum and k-nearest neighbour with Minkowski distance weight calculation, together with the proposed fine-tuning. Its mean positioning error is 0.8740 m for Room 1 and 1.5385 for Room 2.

The authorities are trying to protect the Indonesian banknotes from counterfeiting by embedding up to 12 security features on the banknotes.By its characteristic, the security features are divided into three, which are open, semi-open and closed. However, with so many security features, counterfeit currency on Indonesian banknotes still circulating because the counterfeiters can make a banknote that is very similiar to the original banknote. But, the counterfeiters pay less attention to the details of latent image security feature. Latent image is a semi-open security feature that must be viewed carefully to be able to recognize it.Although this feature can be printed and falsified, the quality of this feature on conterfeit banknotewas very bad. Based on this, original banknote and counterfeit banknote can be detected and classified according to the latent image security features.This research aims to develop a method for detecting the authenticity of banknotes using Deep Learning technology with the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. Outcome of the research can be used to develop an expert system for counterfeit banknotesdetection on Indonesian currency. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

However, motivation and engagement related problems can arise when the gamification elements are not personalized to match the individual's needs. Therefore, this research proposes a Hybrid Learning Model that combines both Gamification and Personality Traits to increase academic achievement and motivation for students who are studying foreign languages online. The methodology for the Hybrid Learning Model includes three different stages: pre-play stage where the students' personalities are gathered using the Big Five Personality questionnaire, gameplay stage where students' dominant personalities are examined to create gamified learning systems based on the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model, and the post-play stage where the effectiveness of the Hybrid Learning Model is measured through a recall test to measure achievement and an ARCS motivation questionnaire to measure motivation using various statistical analysis. The Hybrid Learning Model is applied to a language learning web application named VocaManager and tested the Korean vocabulary skills of non-native students who were learning Korean at a local language center in Indonesia. Using SPSS software, the results showed that students who studied under the Hybrid Learning Model had a significant improvement in both their learning achievements and motivation. In addition, the research revealed a significant positive correlation between students' motivation and students' academic achievements. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Numerous researches have been conducted on this task and each proposed either standalone- or ensemble-based processing technique. While many researches strive for better accuracy, this research also attempts to increase the processing efficiency of computer correctly classifying human emotions based on human face by utilizing a single standalone-based neural network. This research proposes the use of standalone-based modified Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on Visual Geometry Group - 16 (VGG-16) classification model which was pretrained on ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned for emotion classification. The classification is performed on the publicly available FER-2013 dataset of over 35,000 face images with in-the-wild setting for 7 distinct emotions with the provided 80% training, 10% validation, and 10% testing data distributions. The proposed approach outperforms most standalone-based model results with 69.40% accuracy. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

One of the many LMS is Moodle. This LMS has many learning features and can be extended by installing “plugins”. However, Moodle is monolith, which means all its resources like front-end, files, and database are installed in the same server and requires high cost server to do so. This study presents Moodle LMS architecture hosted in Google Cloud Platform to solve this problem. The core LMS learning features are extended by adding location-based learning and object-recognition learning as gamification element. Both features are implemented in the form of Moodle plugins that utilizes external service via API. Location-based learning utilizes Leaflet interactive maps and Google Maps place autocomplete search. While object-recognition learning utilizes an object recognition service (ORS) hosted in Google Kubernetes Engine to classify, store, and create image models. Evaluation of the architecture uses the Architecture Trade-off Analysis Method (ATAM) to evaluate performance and scalability as quality attributes. Experimental results showed that Moodle core LMS could support 480 concurrent users with average response time of 11.37 seconds with 100% availability. While ORS could support 960 concurrent users with availability above 98%. Thus, educators could use this architecture as an example to support many students. In the future, this solution may be evaluated if it could increase student motivation and achievement. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Improvement of motivation and enjoyment could be influenced by player personality. As there is a variety of personalities, gamification application developers should consider including various gameplay to adapt with each personality type. There is a need for adaptive gamification framework. This paper intends to propose an adaptive gamification framework with proper player classification and effectiveness evaluation method. This paper focuses on introducing gamification framework by combining adaptive gameplay, dynamic difficulty adjustment, Big Five personality model, player performance, and evaluation method to measure player motivation and enjoyment to see the effectiveness of gamification applications such as IMMS and eGameFlow.

Fall detection method is needed to minimized the problem when human fallen and smartphone can be used as the device to detect it. Usually people carry smartphone in any positions and can make fall detection method difficult to detect when fall occurs. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) combined with Sigmoid helps to answer the challenge to handle smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope data in many smartphone orientation position. LSTM method on this experiment can achieved 91.67% for the accuracy result. Since the fall data occurs rarely and there may be insufficient data available, the gamification prospect implemented in fall detection application especially on 'Bug' bounty can help researcher to enhance the accuracy result to make a better human fall detection method. © 2019 IEEE.","accelerometer;

With the development of machine learning technique, many researchers had used machine learning techniquesfor indoor positioning system.However, the existing research still uses location classification, even though machine learning can be used as regression to predict location. In this study, we propose a positioning algorithm forindoor positioning system using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), fingerprinting approach and four machine learning regression: Artificial Neural Network Regression (ANN), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Random Forest Regression (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). We compare theperformance in term of Mean of Error, Min of Error, Max of Error, Median of Error and 90 th Percentile of Error between four machine learning regression and the weighted sum method as a benchmark. The results obtained that allmachine learning regression has lowerMean of errorcompared to the weighted sum method.

However, its presence has not been evenly distributed for the central and regional governments. This is because civil servants in parts of Indonesia have not had any insight into the functions and roles of information technology. This research aimed at empirically provides comprehension to the civil servants in Central Mamberamo Regency, one of the remote areas in Indonesia, through a theoretical framework on the use of e-government. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) was modified to determine the factors that influence the behavior of civil servants to use e-government technology. Surveys were conducted to collect research data by distributing a set of questionnaires to civil servants. Respondents’ answers were collected and statistically analyzed using the multiple linear regression method. The results of the analysis showed that factors of performance expectancy, usage effort expectancy, the influence of heads and coworkers, regional government facilities conditions, and the job-fit were to have a powerful influence on the behavior of civil servants to use e-government technology at 72.2%. © 2019 IJSTR.","Civil servants; E-government; Regional government; Statistical analysis; Utaut model",,,,,,,"Anneke Zuiderwijk, A.M.J.A.Y.K.D.B., Acceptance and use predictors of open data technologies: Drawing upon the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (2015) Government Information Quarterly, pp. 1-12; Yakup, A., Adoption of e-government services in Turkey (2017) Computers in Human Behavior, pp. 1-11; Jurisch, M.K.P.W.H.K.M.C., (2015) An International Survey of the Factors Influencing the Intention to use Open Government, , in 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, Germany; Alrawabdeh, W., E-Government Diffusion in Jordan: Employees’ Perceptions Toward Electronic Government in Jordan (2017) American Journal of Applied Sciences, pp. 1-10; Mijail Naranjo Zolotov, A.T.O.A.S.C.B., E- participation adoption models research in the last 17 years: A weight and meta-analytical review (2018) Computers in Human Behavior, pp. 1-16; Manuel Rey-Morenoa, J.A.F.C.M.-M.R.R., Facilitator and inhibitor factors: Adopting e- government in a dual model (2017) Journal of Business Research, pp. 1-8; Lingling Gao, K.A.W.X.B., Understanding consumers’ continuance intention towards mobile (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, pp. 1-14; Faizura Haneema, N.K.N.T.D.P.N.A.A.B., Determinants of master data management adoption by local government organizations: An empirical study (2018) International Journal of Information Management, pp. 1-19; Robert Howard, L.R.C.-Y.C., Addressing individual perceptions: An application of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology to building information modeling (2017) International Journal of Project Management, 35, pp. 107-120 and 1-14. , 2017; Kate Magsamen-Conrad, A.S.U.B.C.Y.J.B.J.D., Bridging the divide: Using UTAUT to predict multigenerational tablet adoption practices (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, pp. 1-11; Rik Peeters, A.W., The digital cage: Administrative exclusion through information architecture (2018) Government Information Quarterly, pp. 1-9; Md Mahmudur Rahman, M.F.L.W.J.H.L.S., Assessing the utility of TAM, TPB, and UTAUT for advanced driver assistance systems (2017) Accident Analysis and Prevention, pp. 1-13; Zeyu Penga, Y.S.X.G., Antecedents of employees’ extended use of enterprise systems: An integrative view of the person, environment, and technology (2018) International Journal of Information Management, pp. 1-17; Sangki, J., Vision of future e-government via new e- government maturity model: Based on Korea’s e- government practices (2017) Telecommunications Policy, pp. 1-12; Saliza Abdul Aziz, K.M.I., (2014) Does design matter in tax e-filing acceptance?, , in International Conference on Accounting Studies 2014, ICAS 2014, 18-19 August 2014, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Malaysia; Bostjan Sumak, A.A.S.A.B., The acceptance and use of interactive whiteboards among teachers: Differences in UTAUT determinants between pre- and post- adopters (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, pp. 1-19; Attuquayefio, S.N., Using the UTAUT model to analyze students’ ICT adoption (2014) International Journal of Education and Development using Information and Communication Technology (IJEDICT), pp. 1-12; Jean Damascene Twizeyimanaa, A.A., The public value of E-Government - A literature review (2019) Government Information Quarterly, pp. 1-12; Chaumon, M.-E.B., L’acceptation située des technologies dans et parl’activité: Premiers étayages pour une clinique del’usage (2016) Psychologie du travail et des organisations, pp. 1-18; Carlos Tam, T.O., Understanding the impact of m- banking on individual performance: DeLone & McLean and TTF perspective (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, pp. 1-12; Di Wanga, C.C.D.R., A prioritization-based analysis of local open government data portals: A case study of Chinese province-level governments (2018) Government Information Quarterly, pp. 1-13",,,,"International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research",,,,,22778616,,,,"English","Int.

The purpose of offloading is to save energy on the mobile devices. When offloading is being carried out, data size is the determining factor of the energy consumption both in mobile device and bandwidth consumption. To minimize the data size factor, data size can be minimized by using compression techniques before it is being offloaded. But when the data is being compressed, mobile devices also consumes energy. The energy consumption required for compression depends on the data size and the quality of the data compression. The system requires a decision-making model to determine whether compression is needed or not. The proposed method for this tradeoff is using machine learning regression methods to make decision based on predictions of the smallest energy consumption value. The test uses 1,210 data which is trained by 5-fold cross validation to find the smallest RMSE value. Regression method with the smallest RMSE value is applied to test data as an evaluation. The results showed that energy consumption efficiency had an average value of 38.68% compared to sending compressed image data without decision-making model. The efficiency value of energy consumption with decision-making model versus direct offloading has an average value of 8.34%. © 2019 IJSTR.","Cross validation; Decision-making; Energy efficiency; Machine learning; Prediction; Regression method; RMSE",,,,,,,"Wu, H., Multi-Objective Decision-Making for Mobile Cloud Offloading: A Survey (2018) IEEE Access, pp. 3962-3976; Cuervo, E., B.A., MAUI: Making smartphones last longer with code offload (2010) ACM, pp. 49-62; Debashis, D., Mobile Cloud Computing: Architectures, Algorithms and Applications (2015) Chapman and Hall/CRC Press, 4; Qi, H., Gani, A., Research On Mobile Cloud Computing: Review, Trend and Perspectives (2012) 2nd International Conference on Digital Information and Communication Technology and its Applications, , DICTAP 2012; Kaur, A., Kaur, K., A Comparative Study of Code Offloading Techniques and Application Partitioning Methods in Mobile Cloud Computing (2016) International Journal of Computer Applications; Lin, Time-and-Energy-Aware Computation Offloading in Handheld Devices to Coprocessors and Clouds (2013) IEEE Systems Journal, pp. 1-13; Sadler, C.M., Martonosi, M., Data Compression Algorithms for Energy-Constrained Devices in Delay Tolerant Networks (2006) Proceeding of ACM SenSys; Wibowo, P.S., (2017) Rancang Bangun Mobile Computation Offloading Framework untuk Peningkatan Kinerja dan Penghematan Daya pada Smartphone (Studi Kasus Leaf Recognition), , Institut Teknologi Sepuluh November, Surabaya; Rustamaji, H.C., Mariani, Yuwono, B., (2014) Aplikasi Kompresi Data Menggunakan Metode Huffman Statik pada Perangkat Mobile Berbasis Android, pp. 9-18. , Telematika; Singh, M., Kumar, S., Chouhan, S., Shrivastava, M., Various Image Compression Techniques: Lossy and Lossless (2016) International Journal of Computer Applications; Tawalbeh, Studying the Energy Consumption in Mobile Devices (2016) The 13th International Conference on Mobile Systems and Pervasive Computing; Balakrishnan, An Energy Efficient Code Offloading Approach for Mobile Cloud Computing (2016) Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 9 (48), pp. 1-5; Li, Make Smartphones Last A Day: Pre-processing Based Computer Vision Application Offloading (2015) 12th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON), , Seattle, WA, USA; Soni, M., Shukla, N., Data Compression Techniques in Cloud Computing (2016) IJARCCE Journal, , ISSN: 2319-5940; Senthilkumar, M., Mathivanan, V., Analysis of Data Compression Techniques using Huffman Coding and Arithmetic Coding (2016) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science and Software Engineering; Govinda, K., Kumar, Y., Storage Optimization in Cloud Environment using Compression Algorithm (2012) International Journal of Emerging Trends & Technology in Computer Science, , ISSN: 2278-6856; Kasireddy, S., Bojja, V., (2012) Measurements of Energy Consumption in Mobile Applications with respect to Quality of Experience, , Blekinge Tekniska Hogskola, Karlskrona; Kasireddy, S., (2012) Measurements of Energy Consumption in Mobile Applications with Respect to Quality of Experience, , Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden; Segata, Towards energy efficient smart phone applications: Energy models for offloading tasks into the cloud (2014) IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), , Sydney, NSW, Australia; Chandrasekhar, V., Chen, T., Chen, C.H., Takacs, G., Vedantham, R.R., Grzesczcuk, R., Bach, G., The Stanford Mobile Visual Search Dataset (2011) Proceedings of the First ACM Multimedia Systems Conference (MMSys), , San Jose; Liu, DeepN-JPEG: A Deep Neural Network Favorable JPEG-based Image Compression Framework (2018) 55th Annual Design Automation Conference",,,,"International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research",,,,,22778616,,,,"English","Int.

The data for this study were collected by recording many sample units from each of the following human activity categories: stand-fall, walk-fall, stand-jump, stand-sit, stand, and walk. Several time-series data captured by the sensors were used as human motion features. One of the challenges of this study was the existence of human body motions whose features resembled those of body falls. In addition, unfixed smartphone positioning made human body falls harder to detect and can lead to high rate of misclassification (not detected as fall). This incident can caused serious bone fracture or even death if the person not handled as immediately as possible because of misclassification. To address this problem, we modified Resultant Acceleration and ∠ Y formulas to address the problem of unconstrained smartphone positions. We proposed to combine five methods such as AGVeSR, Alim, ∠α, GyroReDi, and AGPeak to build a robust detector model to reduce the misclassification. The experiment results showed that the accuracy of the combination of both sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) outperformed the accuracy of accelerometer only by more than 15%. The decision fusion that used voting involving five methods could boost the accuracy rate by up to 4.15%. © BEIESP.","Accelerometer; Gyroscope; Human fall detection; Unconstrained smartphone positions",,,,,,,"de la Concepción, M.Á.Á., Morillo, L.M.S., García, J.A.Á., González-Abril, L., Mobile activity recognition and fall detection system for elderly people using ameva algorithm (2017) Pervasive and Mobile Computing, 34, pp. 3-13;

Visual-based gesture recognition can help to overcome this communication limitation. Recently, several techniques and methods have been proposed in this area of research and showed some improvements. Despite all of the proposed methods, most of hand gesture recognition approaches that have been applied still lack of compatibility and have lots of limitations. For instance, hand segmentation meets the complication of distinguishing the hand and the face region by using skin detection. Motivated by those facts, this paper presents a review and explains progress of feature extraction in sign language recognition mostly in the last ten years. In this contribution, we focus on studying feature extraction methods. The literature used in this study is based on the previous published international papers which discussed sign language recognition. The main objectives from this review are to get the most effective and most compatible feature extraction method to be applied to sign language recognition system and to further research progress in the future. After reviewing various recognition techniques, we can conclude that the current works have successfully improve hand gesture recognition by inventing a technology which helps for tracking hands region precisely by using an active sensor. However, there is still room for improvements based on a markerless passive sensor, such as vision-based approaches. © 2018 IEEE.","feature extraction; gesture recognition; pre-processing method; sign language recognition","Extraction;

Researchers have worked out many different transmitters as well as several positioning algorithms to improve the IPS. In 2012, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) was started to become publicly available and become one of the potential transmitters in IPS. Since then, researchers have proposed many positioning methods specifically for BLE. However, there has been no recent review on IPS techniques using BLE. Therefore, this review was made in order to serve a comprehensive understanding of the different positioning methods, by focusing on BLE. Based on the literature study, four future research directions on IPS using BLE are also provided in this review. © 2019 ICIC International","Bluetooth low energy; Fingerprint-based algorithm; Indoor location-based service; Indoor positioning system; Positioning techniques",,,,,"Binus University: 033/VR","Acknowledgement.

It can cause diseases such as cough, runny nose, eye irritation, and even death. The main objective of this research is to create a device capable of detecting carbon monoxide pollution levels by using mobile sensors and map the results into heatmaps overlayed on Google Maps. We have implemented an integrated pollution monitoring and mapping system that consists of MQ-7 sensor, GPS, GSM, display module, Arduino board, and web-server. We also evaluated two sampling methods, time-based and distance-based sampling. Based on our experiments, the distance-based sampling method produced well-distributed data and closer to the expected between-samples distances compared to the time-based method. We have also shown that our system can run in real time to monitor the carbon monoxide pollution levels. © 2019 The Authors.

Based on past research, optimized localization method for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to predict position of person or object with high accuracy has not been found yet. Most recent research that have solve Received Signal Strength (RSS) inconsistent value is using fingerprint method. This paper proposed a deep regression machine learning using convolutional neural network (CNN) with regression-based fingerprint model to estimate real position. The model used 5 nearest fingerprints as reference RSS values with their location (x or y) label as inputs to produce output of single value position (x or y), then repeat the process to produce second value of position to create complete coordinate of estimated position. To evaluate the proposed model, a comparison between training data with validation data using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is used. The comparisons are with Multilayer Perceptron model and with the weighted sum method as benchmark. The experiment Gave results of mean distance and 90th percentile distance between proposed model with the benchmark. CNN model achieved accuracies of lower than 330cm at 90th percentile with mean distance lower than 185cm. Weighted sum model achieved accuracies lower than 360cm at 90th percentile with mean distance higher than 185cm, and MLP is in between them. The result demonstrates that the proposed method outperformed the benchmark methods. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.","Convolutional neural network; Fingerprinting; Indoor positioning system; Regression machine learning",,,,,,,"Brena, R.F., García-Vázquez, J.P., Galván-Tejada, C.E., Muñoz-Rodriguez, D., Vargas-Rosales, C., Fangmeyer, J., Evolution of indoor positioning technologies: A survey (2017) Journal of Sensors, 2017; Cabarkapa, D., Grujic, I., Pavlovic, P., Comparative analysis of the bluetooth low-energy indoor positioning systems (2015) in 2015 12th International Conference on Telecommunication in Modern Satellite, Cable and Broadcasting Services (TELSIKS); Faragher, R., Harle, R., An analysis of the accuracy of bluetooth low energy for indoor positioning applications (2014) in Proceedings of the 27th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation (ION GNSS+'14); Faragher, R., Harle, R., Location fingerprinting with bluetooth low energy beacons (2015) IEEE journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 33 (11), pp. 2418-2428; Terán, M., Aranda, J., Carrillo, H., Mendez, D., Parra, C., IoT-based system for indoor location using bluetooth low energy (2017) in Communications and Computing (COLCOM), 2017 IEEE Colombian Conference; Topak, F., Pekeriçli, M.K., Tanyer, A.M., Technological Viability Assessment of Bluetooth Low Energy Technology for Indoor Localization (2018) Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering, 32 (5); Contreras, D., Castro, M., de la Torre, D.S., Performance evaluation of bluetooth low energy in indoor positioning systems (2017) Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies, 28 (1); Zhuang, Y., Yang, J., Li, Y., Qi, L., El-Sheimy, N., Smartphone-based indoor localization with bluetooth low energy beacons (2016) Sensors, 16 (5), p. 596; He, S., Chan, S.H.G., Wi-Fi fingerprint-based indoor positioning: Recent advances and comparisons (2016) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 18 (1), pp. 466-490; Yu, F., Jiang, M., Liang, J., Qin, X., Hu, M., Peng, T., Hu, X., 5 G WiFi Signal-Based Indoor Localization System Using Cluster k-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (2014) International journal of distributed sensor networks, 10 (12); Li, C., Qiu, Z., Liu, C., An improved weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm for indoor positioning (2017) Wireless Personal Communications, 96 (2), pp. 2239-2251; Tuncer, S., Tuncer, T., Indoor localization with bluetooth technology using artificial neural networks (2015) in Intelligent Engineering Systems (INES), 2015 IEEE 19th International Conference; Xu, H., Wu, M., Li, P., Zhu, F., Wang, R., An RFID Indoor Positioning Algorithm Based on Support Vector Regression (2018) Sensors, 18 (5), p. 1504; Deng, L., Yu, D., Deep learning: methods and applications (2014) Foundations and Trends® in Signal Processing, 7 (3-4), pp. 197-387; Townsend, K., Cufí, C., Davidson, R., (2014) Getting started with Bluetooth low energy: tools and techniques for low-power networking, , O'Reilly Media, Inc; Goodfellow, I., Bengio, Y., Courville, A., Bengio, Y., (2016) Deep learning, 1. , Cambridge: MIT press; Goodfellow, I.J., Warde-Farley, D., Mirza, M., Courville, A., Bengio, Y., Maxout networks (2013), arXiv preprint; Hoo-Chang, S., Roth, H.R., Gao, M., Lu, L., Xu, Z., Nogues, I., Yao, J., Summers, R.M., Deep convolutional neural networks for computer-aided detection: CNN architectures, dataset characteristics and transfer learning (2016) IEEE transactions on medical imaging, 35 (5), p. 1285; Chai, T., Draxler, R.R., Root mean square error (RMSE) or mean absolute error (MAE)?-Arguments against avoiding RMSE in the literature (2014) Geoscientific model development, 7 (3), pp. 1247-1250; Tishby, N., Zaslavsky, N., Deep learning and the information bottleneck principle (2015) in 2015 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW), , Jerusalem; Wang, Y., Yang, Q., Zhang, G., Zhang, P., Indoor positioning system using Euclidean distance correction algorithm with bluetooth low energy beacon (2016) in 2016 International Conference on Internet of Things and Applications (IOTA), , Pune; Nakai, W., Kawahama, Y., Katsuma, R., Reducing error of positioning based on unstable rssi of short range communication (2018) in 2018 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA), , Krakow; Liu, C., Fang, D., Yang, Z., Jiang, H., Chen, X., Wang, W., Xing, T., Cai, L., RSS distribution-based passive localization and its application in sensor networks (2015) IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 15 (4), pp. 2883-2895",,,,"Science and Information Organization",,,,,2158107X,,,,"English","Intl.

Human's emotion can be reflected through reading or writing a text. In recent years, studies on emotion detection through text has been developed. Most of the study is using a machine learning technique. In this paper, we classified 7 emotions such as anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, surprise, and thankfulness using deep learning technique that is Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Nested Long Short-Term Memory (Nested LSTM). We have compared our results with Support Vector Machine (SVM). We have trained each model with 980,549 training data and tested with 144,160 testing data. Our experiments showed that Nested LSTM and LSTM give better performance than SVM to detect emotions in text. Nested LSTM gets the best accuracy of 99.167%, while LSTM gets the best performance in term of average precision at 99.22%, average recall at 98.86%, and f1-score at 99.04%. © 2019 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.","Emotion detection; Machine learning; Nested LSTM; Sentiment analysis; Text mining",,,,,,,"(2012) Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining, , San Rafael: Morgan & Claypool; Rahmath, H.P., Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis-Challenges and Applications (2014) International Journal of Application or Innovation in Engineering & Management, 3 (5), pp. 401-403. , May; Kaur, J., Saini, R.J., Emotion Detection and Sentiment Analysis in Text Corpus: A Differential Study with Informal and Formal Writing Styles (2014) International Journal of Computer Applications, 101 (9), pp. 1-9; Kim, S.M., (2011) Recognising Emotions and Sentiments in Text, , University of Sydney, Sydney; Buduma, N., (2017) Fundamentals of Deep Learning, , Sebastopol: O'Reilly Media, Inc; Singhal, P., Bhattacharyya, P., (2016) Sentiment Analysis and Deep Learning: A Survey; Arifin, P.K.E., Classification of Emotion in Indonesian Texts Using K-NN methods (2012) International Journal of Information and Electronics Engineering, pp. 899-903; Riany, J., Fajar, M., Lukman, M.P., Penerapan Deep Sentiment Analysis penerapan Deep Sentiment Analysis (2016) Jurnal Sisfo, 6, pp. 147-156; Miedema, F., (2018) Sentiment Analysis with Long Short-Term Memory networks; Moniz, J.R.A., Krueger, D., Nested LSTMs (2018) Computing Research Repository, 1801; Wang, W., Chen, L., Thirunarayan, K., Sheth, A.P., Harnessing Twitter ""Big Data for Automatic Emotion Identification,"" (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 ASE/IEEE International Conference on Social Computing and 2012 ASE/IEEE International Conference on Privacy, pp. 587-592. , Security, Risk and Trust; Shaheen, S., El-Hajj, W., Hajj, H., Elbassuoni, S., Emotion Recognition from Text Based on Automatically Generated Rules (2015) IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, pp. 383-392; Jain, E.U., Sandu, A., Emotion Detection from Punjabi Text using Hybrid Support Vector Machine and Maximum Entropy Algorithm (2015) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 4 (11); Muljono, N., Winarsih, A.S., Supriyanto, C., Evaluation of Classification Methods for Indonesian Text Emotion Detection (2016) International Seminar on Application for Technology of Information and Communication, pp. 130-133; Rahman, R., Islam, T., Ahmed, M.H., Detecting Emotion from Text and Emoticon (2017) London Journal of Research in Computer Science and Technology, 17 (3); Calefato, F., Lanubile, F., Novielli, N., EmoTxt: A Toolkit for Emotion Recognition from Text (2017) 2017 Seventh International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction Workshops and Demos; Mikolov, T., Sutskever, I., Chen, K., Corrado, G., Dean, J., Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and Their Compositionality (2013) in Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems-Volume 2, , Lake Tahoe, Nevada; Olah, C., (2015) Understanding LSTM Networks, , https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/, 27 August .

Therefore, many researchers compete with others to present their best in object recognition. Since object recognition has been studied for a long time and encompassed diverse approaches, therefore a review of the latest works is needed. This paper aims to deliver the trends in object recognition researches focusing on instance recognition and foreground detection such as salient object detection and object detection as supporting methods. Covering 34 publications, we survey the approaches, methods, datasets, performance measure, and experimental results. We also present research challenges in object recognition which can be used as suggestions for future works. We hope that our work can provide an overview of the current trends for object recognition and foreground detection methods. © 2019 The Authors.

A consumer act as a seller put their product in a platform later will be displayed to another consumer act as a buyer. This condition encourages platform to maintain high quality product information especially image that is provided by the seller. Product images need to be relevant to the product itself. It can be controlled automatically using image classification. In this paper, we carried out a research to find out the best deep learning model in image classification for e-commerce products. A dataset of 12,500 product images is collected from various web sources to be used in training and testing process. Five models are selected and fine-tuned using a uniform hyperparameter set-up. Those hyperparameters are found by using a manual process by trying a lot of hyperparameters. The testing result from every model is presented and evaluated. The result shows that NASNetLarge yield the best performance among all evaluated models with 84% testing accuracy. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.","Deep learning; E-commerce; Hyperparameter tuning; Image classification; Product images",,,,,"23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019","This work was supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia, through research grant number 23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019.","Das, K., Gryseels, M., Sudhir, P., Tan, K.T., 'Unlocking Indonesia's digital opportunity,' (2016), pp. 1-28. , October; Dan, C., 'Consumer-To-Consumer (C2C) Electronic Commerce: The Recent Picture,' (2014) Int.

Transfering data from the sensor via the internet network to a monitoring device must be less than 300 ms. One process that can cause non-fulfillment of these requirements is a method for displaying the data on a monitor. There are several methods for delivering data from the sensor to a monitor. This paper has been compared between two methods, namely the polling method and the websocket method. The experiment was conducted to compare these two method. The result obtained that the websocket method was better in presenting real time data compared to the polling method. It can be shown in bandwidth usage and memory usage. In the experiment was found that the average of bandwidth usage is 478KB for polling method, and 91KB for web socket method in web based and the memory consumption of websocket less as much as 16% compared to polling method. In android smartphone the average bandwidth usage is 5.1 KB for web socket method and 15 KB for polling method and the memory consumption of websocket less as much as 22% compared to polling method. © 2019 The Authors.

Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a commonly used database system, but also known to having a decreased performance when handling high amount of data. N oSQL is an alternative storage option that is different than RDBMS and known for faster performance when handling high amount of data. In this contribution, we compare the performances between RDBMS MySQL and a hybrid model of MySQL and NoSQL MongoDB when being used on a web application. We implemented a simple social media website to evaluate the performance of using different database models. The website is equipped with chat and profile view features. Experiments are performed using randomly generated user profiles and chat data. Based on our evaluations, the hybrid database of MySQL and MongoDB achieves higher read and write performances than the MySQL alone. Meanwhile MySQL can handle more sensitive data and maintaining data consistency. The hybrid model database MySQL and MongoDB uses less disk space than MySQL alone, but uses more RAM. We also observed that there is not much difference in CPU usage for both database models. © 2018 IEEE.","database performance; hybrid database; MongoDB; MySQL; web application","Random access storage; Websites; Database performance; Hybrid database; MongoDB; MySQL; WEB application; Information management",,,,,,"Paradaens, J., Bra, P.D., Gyssens, M., Gucht, D.V., (2012) The Structure of the Relational Database Model, , Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg; Lith, A., Mattsson, J., (2010) Investigating Storage Solutions for Large Data-A Comparison of Well Performing and Scalable Data Storage Solutions for Real Time Extraction and Batch Insertion of Data, , Unpublished master's thesis; Cattell, R., Scalable SQL and noSQL data stores (2010) SIGMOD Record, 39 (4), pp. 12-27; DeCandia, G., Hastorun, D., Jampani, M., Kakulapati, G., Lakshman, A., Pilchin, A., Sivasubramanian, S., Vogels, W., Dynamo: Amazon's highly available key-value store (2007) SIGOPS Operating Systems Review, 41 (6), pp. 205-220; Hect, R., Jablonski, S., Nosql evaluation: A use case oriented survey (2011) International Conference on Cloud and Service Computing, Washington DC; Manyika, J., Chui, M., Brown, B., Bughin, J., Dobbs, R., Roxburgh, C., Byers, A.H., (2011) Big Data: The Next Frontier for Innovation, Competition, and Productivity, , San Fransisco: McKinsey Global Institute; Powell, G., (2006) Beginning Database Design Indianapolis, , Wiley Publishing; Cook, R., Is a hybrid database in your future?

Sign Language Recognition (SLR) system, which is required to recognize sign languages, has been widely studied for years. The studies are based on various input sensors, gesture segmentation, extraction of features and classification methods. This paper aims to analyze and compare the methods employed in the SLR systems, classifications methods that have been used, and suggests the most promising method for future research. Due to recent advancement in classification methods, many of the recent proposed works mainly contribute on the classification methods, such as hybrid method and Deep Learning. This paper focuses on the classification methods used in prior Sign Language Recognition system. Based on our review, HMM-based approaches have been explored extensively in prior research, including its modifications. Deep Learning such as Convolutional Neural Network is popular in the past five years. Hybrid CNN-HMM and fully Deep Learning approaches have shown promising results and offer opportunities for further exploration. However, overfitting and high computational requirements still hinder their adoption. We believe the future direction of the research is toward developing a simpler network that can achieve high performance and requires low computational load, which embeds the feature learner into the classifier in multi-layered neural network fashion. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Classification methods; Hidden Markov model; Neural networks; Sign language recognition",,,,,,"This research was supported by Research Grant No. 039A/VR.RTT/VI/2017 from Ministry of Research Technology and Higher Education of Republic of Indonesia.","Adithya, V., Vinod, P.R., Gopalakrishnan, U., Artificial neural network based method for Indian sign language recognition (2013) 2013 IEEE Conference on Information & Communication Technologies (ICT), pp. 1080-1085. , Thuckalay, Tamil Nadu, India; Ahuja, M.K., Singh, A., A Survey of Hand Gesture Recognition (2015) International Journal, 3 (5), pp. 266-271; Apoorva Ranjini, S.S., Chaitra, M., Deepika, V., Patil, J.M., Sign Language Recognition System (2014) International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication, 2 (4), pp. 947-953; Assael, Y.M., Shillingford, B., Whiteson, S., de Freitas, N., (2016) Lipnet: Sentence-Level Lipreading.

However, because the classes distribution in LULC data is naturally imbalance, it is difficult to do the classification. In this paper, we employ Variational Semi-Supervised Learning (VSSL) to solve imbalance problem in LULC of Jakarta City. This VSSL exploits the use of semi-supervised learning on deep learning model. Therefore, it is suitable for classifying data with abundant unlabeled like LULC. The result shows that VSSL achieves 80.17% of overall accuracy, outperforming other algorithms in comparison. © 2017 IEEE.","Imbalanced Learning; Remote Sensing; Variational Autoencoder; Variational Semi-Supervised Learning","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Internet of things; Land use; Remote sensing; Auto encoders; Imbalance problem; Imbalanced Learning; Jakarta; Land use/land cover; Learning models; Overall accuracies; Semi- supervised learning; Supervised learning",,,,"Nvidia","ACKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to acknowledge supports for this project from Bioinformatics and Data Science Research Center, Bina Nusantara University and NVIDIA Education Grant.","Chawla, N.V., Japkowicz, N., Kotcz, A., Editorial: Special issue on learning from imbalanced data sets (2004) ACM Sigkdd Explorations Newsletter, 6 (1), pp. 1-6; Frasca, M., Bertoni, A., Re, M., Valentini, G., A neural network algorithm for semi-supervised node label learning from unbalanced data (2013) Neural Networks, 43, pp. 84-98; Li, S., Wang, Z., Zhou, G., Lee, S.Y.M., Semi-supervised learning for imbalanced sentiment classification (2011) IJCAI Proceedings-International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 22 (3), p. 1826; Kingma, D.P., Mohamed, S., Rezende, D.J., Welling, M., Semisupervised learning with deep generative models (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3581-3589; Bruzzone, L., Serpico, S.B., Classification of imbalanced remotesensing data by neural networks (1997) Pattern Recognition Letters, 18 (11), pp. 1323-1328; Waske, B., Benediktsson, J.A., Sveinsson, J.R., Classifying remote sensing data with support vector machines and imbalanced training data (2009) International Workshop on Multiple Classifier Systems, pp. 375-384. , Springer; (2015) The USGS Website, , http://www.usgs.gov/, [Online]; (2015) Badan Informasi Geospasial (BIG), Indonesian Geospasial Portal, , http://portal.ina-sdi.or.id/, [Online]; (2010) Klasifikasi Penutup Lahan, p. 28. , BSN - National Standarization Agency of Indonesia SNI 7645; Di Gregorio, A., (2005) Land Cover Classification System: Classification Concepts and User Manual: LCCS, , Food & Agriculture Org; Zhu, Z., Wang, S., Woodcock, C.E., Improvement and expansion of the fmask algorithm: Cloud, cloud shadow, and snow detection for landsats 47, 8, and sentinel 2 images (2015) Remote Sensing of Environment, 159, pp. 269-277. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article, [Online]; Kingma, D.P., Welling, M., Auto-encoding variational bayes (2014) Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), , http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114, [Online]; Kullback, S., Leibler, R.A., On information and sufficiency (1951) The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 22 (1), pp. 79-86; Campbell, J.B., Wynne, R.H., (2011) Introduction to Remote Sensing, , 5th ed.

Recently, deep learning networks using Triplet Loss have become a common framework for person identification and verification. In this paper, we present a new method on how to select appropriate hard-negatives for training using Triplet Loss. We show that, by incorporating pairs which would otherwise have been discarded yields better accuracy and performance. We also applied Adaptive Moment Estimation algorithm to mitigate the risk of early convergence due to the additional hard-negative pairs. In LFW verification benchmark, we managed to achieve an accuracy of 0.955 and AUC of 0.989 as opposed to 0.929 and 0.973 in the original OpenFace. © 2018 The Authors.

This paper's aim is to introduce the more interesting and interactive way to introduce Tais. Utilization of Augmented Reality (AR) technology in an application built with the Unity3D program is done to provide different way in presenting interesting and interactive information to its users. Based on the results in this paper, the developed application can handle the presentation in more interesting and interactive way. The ideal distance in the tracking process for target objects with size 7 x 6 cm is ranged from 6 cm to 30 cm, with the image ratio that can be detected at the farthest distance is 4% of the camera image. For the detection angle, the target object can be detected properly from approximately ±640. From the data acquired, it can be said that AR can be used to introduce Tais in more interesting and interactive way. © 2018 The Authors.

This paper surveys some analysis of gamification models. MDA framework is used to identify surveyed papers by breaking them down into three categories: mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics. Findings from the survey show there are many gamification models in education domain. However, there are some very representative gamification models could be used as a method to increase motivation, achievement and engagement in learning activities. By knowing the latest gamification models in education domain stated in this paper, it could help gamification practitioners to make new strategies in learning activities to increase students' motivation, achievement and involvement. We also suggest some gamification strategies, which combine several mechanics in such a way to create dynamics that results in all types of aesthetics outputs. © 2018 The Authors.

In terms of purpose, game has two types, which is serious game and non-serious game. As learning media, serious games need to have ability to motivate its player in order to play the game until the end so the player can finish the game while understanding learning materials given in the game. Therefore, the quality of serious game should be measured, like any other software. When it comes to measure serious games, previous models can't do the job well since all of them have no way to measure the game's content, especially to measure the content that can improve player's motivation. This paper proposes a new game measurement metric to measure the game quality factors, especially to measure serious game contents that can motivate its players. The result of this paper is a metric table consisted of measureable factors and type of test to measure them. © 2017 IEEE.","Motivational factors; Quality factors; Quality measurement; Quality metric; Serious games","Computer games; Human computer interaction; Game contents; Learning materials; Learning media; Motivational factors; Quality factors; Quality measurements; Quality metrices; Video game; Serious games",,,,,,"Trisnadoli, A., Hendradjaya, B., Sunindyo, W.D., A proposal of quality model for mobile games (2015) 5th Int.

Unfortunately, every research has its own limitations and are still unable to be used commercially. Some of the researches have known to be successful for recognizing sign language, but require an expensive cost to be commercialized. Nowadays, researchers have gotten more attention for developing Sign Language Recognition that can be used commercially. Researchers do their researches in various ways. It starts from the data acquisition methods. The data acquisition method varies because of the cost needed for a good device, but cheap method is needed for the Sign Language Recognition System to be commercialized. The methods used in developing Sign Language Recognition are also varied between researchers. Each method has its own strength compare to other methods and researchers are still using different methods in developing their own Sign Language Recognition. Each method also has its own limitations compared to other methods. The aim of this paper is to review the sign language recognition approaches and find the best method that has been used by researchers. Hence other researchers can get more information about the methods used and could develop better Sign Language Application Systems in the future. © 2017 The Authors.

However, collecting necessary ground truth data for research in this field requires a lot of effort. Therefore, this paper presents a method for constructing estimated ground truth data using classification. This method reduces the workload in collecting remote sensing ground truth data. The contribution of this paper is to prepare and provide estimated Land Cover/Land Use (LULC) ground truth data of Jakarta area using the proposed method. The estimated ground truth data then can be used along with remote sensing image of Jakarta area to form dataset, which can be used for remote sensing research. For the estimated ground truth data to be reliable, the employed classification model have to achieve a reasonably good result. This research compares several algorithms to find the classification model with the best result for this case. The experimental result shows that Neural Network with single hidden layer of 30 neurons achieves best test accuracy of 75.41%. The method of this paper has been successfully implemented to construct LULC dataset of Jakarta area. © 2016 IEEE.","classification; dataset; land cover; land use; remote sensing","Classification (of information); Image reconstruction; Land use; Classification methods; Classification models; dataset; Ground truth data; Hidden layers; Land cover; Land use/land cover; Remote sensing images; Remote sensing",,,,,,"Liu, Y., Cao, G., Sun, Q., Siegel, M., Hyperspectral classification via deep networks and superpixel segmentation (2015) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 36 (13), pp. 3459-3482. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2015.1055607, [Online]; Mnih, V., Hinton, G.E., Learning to detect roads in high-resolution aerial images (2010) Computer Vision-ECCV 2010, pp. 210-223. , Springer; Mnih, V., Hinton, G.E., Learning to label aerial images from noisy data (2012) Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-12), pp. 567-574; Halmy, M.W.A., Gessler, P.E., Hicke, J.A., Salem, B.B., Land use/land cover change detection and prediction in the north-western coastal desert of Egypt using markov-ca (2015) Applied Geography, 63, pp. 101-112. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622815001599, [Online]; Han, H., Yang, C., Song, J., Scenario simulation and the prediction of land use and land cover change in Beijing, China (2015) Sustainability, 7 (4), pp. 4260-4279; Mondal, A., Khare, D., Kundu, S., Mishra, P., Detection of land use change and future prediction with markov chain model in a part of narmada river basin, madhya pradesh (2014) Landscape Ecology and Water Management, Ser.

Recent contributions in visual tracking are dominated by template-based tracking approaches such as ESM due to its accuracy in estimating the camera pose. However, it is shown that the template-based tracking approach is less robust against large inter-frames displacements and image variations than the featurebased tracking. Therefore, we propose to combine the feature-based and template-based tracking into a hybrid tracking model to improve the overall tracking performance. The feature-based tracking is performed prior to the template-based tracking. The feature-based tracking estimates pose changes between frames using the tracked feature-points. The template-based tracking is then used to refine the estimated pose. As a result, the hybrid tracking approach is robust against large interframes displacements and image variations. It also accurately estimates the camera pose. Furthermore, we will show that the pose adjustment performed by the feature-based tracking reduces the number of iterations necessary for the ESM to refine the estimated pose.

The system includes a web portal running on the Amazon cloud server for people without programming skill to create trails for outdoor fieldtrip learning, and two universal apps for iOS and Android phones respectively to run different learning trails. It enables rapid and easy creation of learning trails within 15 minutes without mobile app development.

Early fusion data contains richer information about the input biometric than the compressed features or matching scores. We propose an image recombination for face recognition that explores the dependency between modalities at the image level. Facial cues from the 2D and 3D images are recombined into a more independent and discriminating data by finding transformation axes that account for the maximal amount of variances in the images. We also introduce a complete framework of multimodal 2D + 3D face recognition that utilizes the 2D and 3D facial information at the enrollment, image and score levels.

Facial cues from 2D and 3D images are fused into more independent and discriminating data by finding fusion axes that pass through the most uncorrelated information in the images. Experimental results based on our face database of 1280 2D + 3D facial samples from 80 adults show that our image-level fusion approach outperforms the pixel- and metric-level fusion approaches. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Face recognition; Image level fusion; Multimodal","Fusion reactions; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Image fusion; Imaging techniques; Nuclear physics; Three dimensional; 3 D face recognition; 3D (three dimensional) imaging; Face databases; Fusion axes; Heidelberg (CO); International conferences; Level fusion; Multi-modal; Uncorrelated; Face recognition",,,,,,"Bowyer, K.W., Chang, K., Flynn, P., A Survey of Approaches and Challenges in 3D and Multi-modal 3D + 2D Face Recognition (2006) Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 101, pp. 1-15; Abate, A.F., Nappi, M., Riccio, D., Sabatino, G., 2D and 3D Face Recognition: A Survey (2007) Pattern Recognition Letters, 28, pp. 1885-1906; Tsutsumi, S., Kikuchi, S., Nakajima, M., Face Identification Using a 3D Gray-scale Image - A Method for Lessening Restrictions on Facial Direction (1998) 3rd IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, pp. 306-311. , Japan, pp; Wang, Y., Chua, C.S., Ho, Y.K., Facial Feature Detection and Face Recognition from 2D and 3D Images (2002) Pattern Recognition Letters, 23, pp. 1191-1202; Beumier, C., Acheroy, M., Face Verification from 3D and Grey Level Clues (2001) Pattern Recognition Letters, 22, pp. 1321-1329; Bronstein, A.M., Bronstein, M.M., Kimmel, R., Expression-Invariant 3D Face Recognition (2003) LNCS, 2688, pp. 62-70. , Kittler, J, Nixon, M.S, eds, AVBPA 2003, Springer, Heidelberg; Chang, K.I., Bowyer, K.W., Flynn, P.J., An Evaluation of Multimodal 2D+3D Face Biometrics (2005) IEEE Transaction on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 27, pp. 619-624; Lu, X., Jain, A.K., Integrating Range and Texture Information for 3D Face Recognition (2005) 7th IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision, pp. 156-163. , Colorado, pp; Tsalakanidou, F., Malassiotis, S., Strintzis, M.G., Face Localization and Authentication Using Color and Depth Images (2005) IEEE Transaction on Image Processing, 14, pp. 152-168; Husken, M., Brauckmann, M., Gehlen, S., Von der Malsburg, C., Strategies and Benefits of Fusion of 2D and 3D Face Recognition (2005) 2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition - Workshops, p. 174. , California, p; Tsalakanidou, F., Tzovaras, D., Strintzis, M.G., Use of Depth and Colour Eigenfaces for Face Recognition (2003) Pattern Recognition Letters, 24, pp. 1427-1435; Abdelkader, C.B., Griffin, P.A., Comparing and Combining Depth and Texture Cues for Face Recognition (2005) Image and Vision Computing, 23, pp. 339-352; Godil, A., Ressler, S., Grother, P., Face Recognition Using 3D Facial Shape and Color Map Information: Comparison and Combination (2005) Biometrie Technology for Human Identification, 5404, pp. 351-361. , SPIE; Wang, Y., Chua, C.S., Face Recognition from 2D and 3D Images Using 3D Gabor Filters (2005) Image and Vision Computing, 23, pp. 1018-1028; Cohen, J., (1988) Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, , Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, New Jersey; Konica, Minolta, Vivid 910 3D Digitizer, , http://www.konicaminolta.com.sg; Belhumeur, P.N., Hespanha, J.P., Kriegman, D.J., Eigenfaces vs. Fisherfaces: Recognition Using Class Specific Linear Projection (1997) IEEE Transaction on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 19, pp. 711-720; Johnson, R.A., Wichern, D.W., (1992) Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis, , Prentice Hall, New Jersey","Kusuma, G.

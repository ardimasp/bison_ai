Production planning is one of its stages. Almost all of companies want to make production process efficient and optimized with minimum expenses while still meet with the market demand. This paper present production planning problem in furniture company with different operational constraint, including production time, warehouse capacity, and quantity of raw materials. The fuzzy goal programming applied to maximize the profit, minimize the production cost and minimize raw materials cost. In this paper was conducted at the furniture company CV. Arte Jaya which aims to help company for decision making regarding to production planning model by using fuzzy goal programming. This Method is suitable for CV. Arte Jaya because the objective function can be adapted to preferences of the company. The result obtained application program for solving decision making problem about the amount of production that is exact and still meet with the market demand. The application program that has been created is able to simplify the user's performance of CV. Arte Jaya. © 2018 The Author(s).","Decision making; Fuzzy goal programming; Production planning; Supply chain","Application programs; Commerce; Computer programming; Decision making; Enterprise resource planning; Linear programming; Multiobjective optimization; Planning; Production control; Supply chains; Decision-making problem; Fuzzy goal programming; Fuzzy goal-programming model; Objective functions; Operational constraints; Production Planning; Production planning IS; Raw materials costs; Problem solving",,,,,"We thank to Bina Nusantara University was supported this research and who provided insight and expertise that greatly assisted this paper","Gupta, M., Bhattacharjee, D., Two Weighted Fuzzy Goal Programming Methods to Solve Multiobjective Goal Programming Problem (2012) Journal of Applied Mathematics, , 2012; Li, S., Yang, Y., Teng, C., Fuzzy Goal Programming with Multiple Priorities via Generalized Varying-Domain Optimization Method.

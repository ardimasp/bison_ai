This paper presents the applications of process mining in automotive industry. Using event log data with timestamps, process mining algorithms, like inductive miner and fuzzy miner were able to automatically generate car manufacturing processes, automatically checking the conformance between the actual processes and the predefined standard ones, and identify and solve any bottlenecks and issues in the car manufacturing processes. A number of car manufacturing issues were considered in this research, such as process delays, stagnant workflow, mismanagement, faulty production and labor insufficiency. The modeling and statistical results show promising leverage of process mining in automotive industry that can lead to the autonomous car manufacturing with abilities for real-time process auditing and reengineering. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,"Binus University: 033/VR, RTT/IV/2019","This research has been conducted and funded through a research grant program supported by Bina Nusantara University with a number of 033/VR.RTT/IV/2019.","van der Aalst, W.

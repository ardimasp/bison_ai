Children with strong core muscles allow them to do any kinds of activities that mostly involve physical movement. The work tested on an education organisation that aims to strengthen core muscles by providing yoga-like poses. There are certified trainers that will coach the students along the way. However, mistakes could be made during the coaching because of different trainer's justification and whether the coaching processes were done correctly. Therefore, a solution is proposed to develop a computerized pose detector package which allows the trainers to improve the coaching with the students. The result is promising where the standardized pose could be implemented and compared to observed students' poses, however it is found that due to the uniqueness of the poses, it generates several unidentified results. © 2020 IEEE.","Children education; Computer vision; Human pose","Computer vision; Information management; Muscle; Students; Human pose; Physical movements; Gesture recognition",,,,,"We would like to show our gratitude to BINUS University RTTO for the support towards the research.","Akuhota, V., Nedler, S.F., Core strengthening (2004) American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation; Szeliski, R., (2010) Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications, , Springer; Bradski, G., Kaehler, A., (2008) Learning OpenCV, , O'Reilly; Cao, Z., Simon, T., Wei, S.-E., Sheikh, Y., (2017) Realtime Multi-Person 2D Pose Estimation Using Part Affinity Fields, , The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University; Ganesh, P., Human pose estimation: Simplified (2019) Towards Data Science, , https://towardsdatascience.com/human-pose-estimation-simplified-6cfd88542ab3, 26 March.

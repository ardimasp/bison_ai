Further, this research investigates whether interaction of corporate and endorser credibility in ads can help consumers improve their perception toward the risk and confidence to purchase the product. An experimental study with a 2 (endorser credibility: high vs. low) × 2 (corporate credibility: high vs. low) full-factorial, between-subjects design was used to see the interaction effect of both corporate and endorser credibility on consumer perceived risk and consumer confidence to purchase a product. In a technologically complex product such as smartphones, consumers’ perceived risk was found to be lower when the product was produced by a credible company but endorsed by a less credible source, than when it was produced by a less credible company but endorsed by a more credible source. Consumer confidence in purchasing the product was also higher when the product was produced by a credible company but endorsed by a less credible source, than when it was produced by a less credible company but endorsed by a more credible source. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","consumer confidence; Corporate credibility; Elaboration Likelihood Model; endorser credibility; perceived risk; purchase decision; technologically complex product",,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., Joachimsthaler, E., (2000) Brand Leadership, , New York: Free Press; Akaah, I.P., Korgaonkar, P.K., A Conjoint Investigation of the Relative Importance of Risk Relievers in Direct Marketing (1988) Journal of Advertising Research, 28 (August/September), pp. 38-44; Atkin, C., Block, M., Effectiveness of Celebrity Endorsers (1983) Journal of Advertising Research, 23 (February/March), pp. 57-61; Bauer, R.A., Consumer Behavior as Risk Taking (1960) Dynamic Marketing for a Changing World, pp. 389-398. , Hancock R.S., (ed), Chicago, IL: American Marketing Association,. edited by; Bennett, P.D., Harrell, G.D., The Role of Confidence in Understanding and Predicting Buyers’ Attitudes and Purchase Intentions (1975) Journal of Consumer Research, 2, pp. 110-117; Berger, I.E., The Nature of Attitude Accessibility and Attitude Confidence: A Triangulated Experiment (1992) Journal of Consumer Psychology, 1, pp. 103-123; Berger, I.E., Mitchell, A.A., The Effect of Advertising on Attitude Accessibility, Attitude Confidence, and the Attitude-Behavior Relationship (1989) Journal of Consumer Research, 16 (December), pp. 269-279; Biswas, D., Biswas, A., Das, N., The Differential Effects of Celebrity and Expert Endorsements on Consumer Risk Perceptions: The Role of Consumer Knowledge, Perceived Congruency, and Product Technology Orientation (2006) Journal of Advertising Research, 35 (2), pp. 17-31; Bower, B.A., Landreth, S., Is Beauty Best?

This research identified a positive relationship between consumers engagement in social networking sites (SNS) on their susceptibility to global consumption influence, which is a multidimensional factor consisting of conformity to trend, social prestige, and quality perception. Furthermore, consumer engagement in SNS and susceptibility to global consumption influence positively affect social influence on SNS. That is, consumers with higher participation in SNS are more prone to global consumer convergence and peer influence on SNS. As implications for tourism and hospitality businesses, strategies to manage consumer-to-consumer communication on social media are suggested. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","social influence; social media; social network; susceptibility",,,,,,"Akehurst, G., User generated content: The use of blogs for tourism organisations and tourism consumers (2009) Service Business, 3, pp. 51-61; Amaldoss, W., Jain, S., Reference groups and product line decisions: An experimental investigation of limited editions and product proliferation (2005) Management Science, 56, pp. 621-644; Aral, S., Walker, D., Identifying influential and susceptible members of social networks (2012) Science, 337, pp. 337-341; Bagozzi, R.P., Yi, Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models (1988) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16 (1), pp. 74-94; Batra, R., Ramaswamy, V., Alden, D.L., Steenkamp, J.B.E.M., Ramachander, S., Effects of brand local and nonlocal origin on consumer attitudes in developing countries (2000) Journal of Consumer Psychology, 9, pp. 83-95; Bearden, W.O., Netemeyer, R.G., Teel, J.E., Measurement of consumer susceptibility to interpersonal influence (1989) Journal of Consumer Research, 15, pp. 473-481; Bearden, W.O., Rose, R.L., Attention to social comparison information: An individual difference factor affecting consumer conformity (1990) Journal of Consumer Research, 16, pp. 461-471; Bothner, M.S., Competition and social influence: The diffusion of the sixth generation processor in the global computer industry (2003) American Journal of Sociology, 108, pp. 1175-1210; Burt, R.S., (1982) Toward a structural theory of action: Network models of social structure, perception, and action, , New York, NY, Academic Press; Burt, R.S., Social contagion and innovation: Cohesion versus structural equivalence (1987) American Journal of Sociology, 92, pp. 1287-1335; Chan, N.L., Denizci Guillet, B., Investigation of social media marketing: How does the hotel industry in Hong Kong perform in marketing on social media websites?

A 2 (Familiarity: Familiar vs. Unfamiliar) × 2 (Product Fit: Fit vs. Unfit) × 2 (Brand Fit: Fit vs. Unfit) × 2 (Country: U.S. vs. Indonesia) between-subjects design was conducted. The results show that co-branding with retailers is not a good strategy for luxury brands in Indonesia, which is characterized by a high level of collectivism. However, consumers in the U.S., which is characterized by a low level of collectivism, demonstrate a positive attitude change toward the luxury brand when they are not familiar with the luxury brand or when the luxury brand collaborates with a high-end retailer. This study provides some valuable insights for luxury brands regarding their expansion strategy into foreign countries. One contribution is that we demonstrate that cross-cultural theories on brand extension and co-branding literature might not be applied to luxury brands. We find that Hofstede's power distance and individualism/collectivism dimensions could be used to explain the discrepancy. We also provide valuable insights for co-branding strategy for luxury brands. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","brand extension; brand management; co-branding; cross-culture; Luxury brand",,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., Keller, K.L., Consumer evaluations of brand extensions (1990) Journal of Marketing, 54, pp. 27-41; Babin, B.J., Darden, W.R., Griffin, M., Work and/or fun: Measuring hedonic and utilitarian shopping value (1994) Journal of Consumer Research, 20 (4), pp. 644-656. , http://dx.doi.org/; Brannen, M.Y., Transferring core competencies abroad in people-dependent industries: A lesson in transcultural materialism from the Walt Disney Corporation (1996) CEMS Business Review, 1, pp. 97-100; Broniarczyk, S.M., Alba, J.W., The importance of the brand in brand extension (1994) Journal of Marketing Research, 31 (2), pp. 214-228. , http://dx.doi.org/; Chandon, P., Wansink, B., Laurent, G., A benefit congruency framework of sales promotion effectiveness (2000) Journal of Marketing, 64 (4), pp. 65-81. , http://dx.doi.org/; Chang, A., Haute couture and discounters walk down the aisle (2011) Los Angeles Times; Charles, K.K., Hurst, E., Roussanov, N., (2007) Conspicuous consumption and race.

Nevertheless, such market expansion can be risky, and the luxury goods company must avoid tarnishing the equity contained in the luxury brand. This study examines the effects of a co-branding strategy between luxury brands and retailers on consumers' evaluation of the luxury brand's image. We use information integration theory (IIT) as the basis for our study, as it can be used to explore how attitudes are formed and changed as new information is combined with existing cognitions and thoughts. A theoretical model based on IIT is built and empirically tested using a sample of 240 Taiwanese adult consumers. We conduct an experimental survey study in which we manipulate luxury brand familiarity and product and brand fit between luxury brand and the co-brand, and assess priorattitudes and post-attitudes toward the luxury brand and attitudes toward the co-brand. We find support for many of our hypotheses: prior-attitudes toward the luxury brand is positively related to the attitude toward the co-brand, brand fit is related to attitudes toward the co-brand, and brand fit is marginally related to the post-attitude toward the luxury brand. Other hypotheses, however (such as those regarding product fit) were not supported. We conclude by discussing our theoretical and managerial contributions. © 2012 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand evaluation; Brand image; Co-branding; Luxury brand; Retailer marketing strategy",,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., (1991) Managing Brand Equity, , New York, NY: Free Press; Aaker, D.A., Keller, K.L., Consumer evaluations of brand extensions (1990) The Journal of Marketing, 54 (1), pp. 27-41; Anderson, N.H., Integration theory and attitude change (1971) Psychological Review, 78, pp. 171-206; Anderson, N.H., (1981) Foundations of Information Integration Theory, , New York, NY Academic Press; Anderson, N.H., Contribution to integration theory (1991) Hillsdale, , NJ Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Bharadwaj, S.G., Varadarajan, P.R., Fahy, J., Sustainable competitive advantage in service industries: A conceptual model and research propositions (1993) The Journal of Marketing, 57 (4), pp. 83-99; Broniarczyk, S.M., Alba, J.W., The importance of the brand in brand extension (1994) Journal of Marketing Research, 31 (2), pp. 214-228; Dacin, P.A., Smith, D.C., The effect of brand portfolio characteristics on consumer evaluations of brand extensions (1994) Journal of Marketing Research, 31 (2), pp. 229-242; Erdem, T., Swait, J., Brand credibility, brand consideration, and choice (2004) Journal of Consumer Research, 31 (1), pp. 191-198; Fazio, R.H., How do attitudes guide behavior?

Such an enterprise has abundant data yet inadequate resources to analyze such data. This paper presents the data mining method, namely the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to predict the revenue based on the previous data. ANN can help the enterprise by extracting the patterns formed in previous years, so that rental income can be predicted more accurately. Primary data were collected based on direct interviews with the management of the enterprise. The analysis was done by conducting training on the previous data to build a neural network model. Then the model is used to make predictions on rental income in subsequent years. The results showed that this model has yielded a much smaller total error value than that of previous calculation. Thus, it can be concluded that ANN can generate rental income predictions more accurate so that it can assist the enterprise in making strategic decisions based on hidden information from existing data. © 2010 IEEE.","Artificial neural network; Bina Nusantara; Data mining; Prediction","Artificial Neural Network; Bina Nusantara; Conventional approach; Data mining methods; Error values; Hidden information; Neural network model; Prediction; Previous year; Primary data; Strategic decisions; Data mining; Forecasting; Industry; Telecommunication; Neural networks",,,,,"Burney, Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm for Karachi Stock Exchange Share Rates Forecasting (2005) World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, 3, pp. 171-176; Gallo, C., (2005) Artificial Neural Networks in Financial Modelling, , University of Foggia; Goh, B.S., (2009) Greatest Descent Algorithms in Unconstrained Optimization, , Springer Science, Business Media; Demuth, H., (2009) Neural Network ToolboxTM 6 User's Guide, , MathWorks, Natick; Zhang, H., Multi-objective simultaneous prediction of waterborne coating properties (2009) Journal of Mathematical Chemistry, 46, pp. 1050-1059; Han, J., Kamber, M., (2006) Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, , 2nd ed., Morgan Kaufmann, Amsterdam; Mar, K., Naing, T., Optimum Neural Network Architecture for Precipitation Prediction of Myanmar (2008) World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, 48, pp. 130-134; Azlan, M., (2009) Application of Regression and ANN Techniques for Modeling of the Surface Roughness in End Milling Machining Process, , IEEE Computer Society, DOI 10.1109/AMS.2009.76; Bramer, M., (2007) Principles of Data Mining, , Springer-Verlag, London; McNelis, P., (2005) Neural Network in Finance: Gaining Predictive Edge in the Market, , Elsevier Inc; Roiger, R., Richard, M., (2003) Data Mining A Tutorial-Based Primer, , Addison Wesley, Boston; Rahmat, Perbandingan Algoritma Levenberg-Marquardt dengan Metoda Backpropagation pada Proses Learning Jaringan Saraf Tiruan untuk Pengenalan Pola Sinyal Elektrokardiograf (2006) Seminar Nasional Aplikasi Teknologi Informasi 2006, pp. F39-F44; Nobuo, Y., (2007) Sparse Quasi-Newton Updates with Positive Definite Matrix Completion, , Springer-Verlag","Sanjaya, C.; Faculty of Computer Science, , Jakarta, Indonesia; email: purple_xtin@yahoo.com",,,,"2010 2nd International Conference on Advances in Computing, Control and Telecommunication Technologies, ACT 2010","2 December 2010 through 3 December 2010","Jakarta",83583,,9780769542690,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

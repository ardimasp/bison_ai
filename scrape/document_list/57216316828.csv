Moreover, traffic accident information from social media such as Twitter is easy to obtain when compared to other data source from police or government institutions. In this work, we tried to create a traffic accident dataset. We crawling on Twitter, then do a text processing which involves case folding, filtering, stemming, tokenizing, and stop word removal. To find out whether the tweet is true about accident information, then we do a word embedding using FastText method and classification with SVM, KNN, and Naïve Bayes algorithms then testing the accuracy of models using K-fold validation method. The results show that the best accuracy of the model is up to 85% with SVM method. This model is then applied to a tweet dataset containing 142,168 tweets taken through the crawling process since April 2019 and can be used for further research on https://www.dodyagung.com/dataset/accident. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

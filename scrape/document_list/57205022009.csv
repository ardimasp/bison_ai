Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a commonly used database system, but also known to having a decreased performance when handling high amount of data. N oSQL is an alternative storage option that is different than RDBMS and known for faster performance when handling high amount of data. In this contribution, we compare the performances between RDBMS MySQL and a hybrid model of MySQL and NoSQL MongoDB when being used on a web application. We implemented a simple social media website to evaluate the performance of using different database models. The website is equipped with chat and profile view features. Experiments are performed using randomly generated user profiles and chat data. Based on our evaluations, the hybrid database of MySQL and MongoDB achieves higher read and write performances than the MySQL alone. Meanwhile MySQL can handle more sensitive data and maintaining data consistency. The hybrid model database MySQL and MongoDB uses less disk space than MySQL alone, but uses more RAM. We also observed that there is not much difference in CPU usage for both database models. © 2018 IEEE.","database performance; hybrid database; MongoDB; MySQL; web application","Random access storage; Websites; Database performance; Hybrid database; MongoDB; MySQL; WEB application; Information management",,,,,"Paradaens, J., Bra, P.D., Gyssens, M., Gucht, D.V., (2012) The Structure of the Relational Database Model, , Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg; Lith, A., Mattsson, J., (2010) Investigating Storage Solutions for Large Data-A Comparison of Well Performing and Scalable Data Storage Solutions for Real Time Extraction and Batch Insertion of Data, , Unpublished master's thesis; Cattell, R., Scalable SQL and noSQL data stores (2010) SIGMOD Record, 39 (4), pp. 12-27; DeCandia, G., Hastorun, D., Jampani, M., Kakulapati, G., Lakshman, A., Pilchin, A., Sivasubramanian, S., Vogels, W., Dynamo: Amazon's highly available key-value store (2007) SIGOPS Operating Systems Review, 41 (6), pp. 205-220; Hect, R., Jablonski, S., Nosql evaluation: A use case oriented survey (2011) International Conference on Cloud and Service Computing, Washington DC; Manyika, J., Chui, M., Brown, B., Bughin, J., Dobbs, R., Roxburgh, C., Byers, A.H., (2011) Big Data: The Next Frontier for Innovation, Competition, and Productivity, , San Fransisco: McKinsey Global Institute; Powell, G., (2006) Beginning Database Design Indianapolis, , Wiley Publishing; Cook, R., Is a hybrid database in your future?

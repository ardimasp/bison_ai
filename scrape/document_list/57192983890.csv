There are a lot of factors affecting delays in a construction project. Each construction project has its own characteristic which is different from other projects regarding the nature of the project and its location. Kepulauan Anambass Regency is several islands located on the remote and outmost of Indonesia which makes construction projects in this area unique according to its location. The aim of this research is to identify the dominant factors that cause delay in building construction project located in Kepulauan Anambass Regency. The results show that the dominant factors are delay in material delivery, transportation problems in material delivery, shortage of material in the market and adverse weather condition. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","building construction project; delay; dominant factors; Kepulauan Anambas","Materials handling; Adverse weather; Building construction projects; Construction projects; delay; Dominant factor; Kepulauan Anambas; Material deliveries; Transportation problem; Construction",,,,"Binus University","The authors would like to acknowledge Bina Nusantara University for the funding support of the research project.","Mhetre, K., Konnur, B., Landage, A.B., Risk Management in Construction Industry (2016) International Journal of Engineering Research, 5, pp. 153-155; Odimabo, O.O., Oduoza, C.F., Suresh, S., Methodology for Project Risk Assessment of Building Construction Projects Using Bayesian Belief Networks (2017) International Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 6, pp. 221-234; Wongkar, Y.K., Tjakra, J., Pratasis, P.A., Analisis Life Cycle Cost Pada Pembangunan Gedung (Studi Kasus: Sekolah St: URSULA Kotamobagu) (2016) Jurnal Sipil Statik, 4, pp. 253-262; Hassan, H., Mangare, J.B., Pratasis, P.A., Faktor-Faktor Penyebab Keterlambatan Pada Proyek Konstruksi Dan Alternatif Penyelesaiannya (Studi Kasus: Di Manado Town Square III) (2016) Jurnal Sipil Statik, 4, pp. 657-664; Shebob, A., Dawood, N., Shah, R.K., Development of A Methodology for Analysing and Quantifying the Impact of Delay Factors Affecting Construction Projects (2012) Journal of Construction Engineering and Project Management, 2 (3), pp. 17-29; Sweis, G.J., Factors Affecting Time Overruns in Public Construction Projects: The Case of Jordan (2013) International Journal of Business and Management, 8 (23), pp. 120-129; Akhund, M.A., Khoso, A.R., Memon, U., Khahro, S.H., Time Overrun in Construction Projects of Developing Countries (2017) Imperial Journal of Interdisciplinary Research (IJIR), 3, pp. 124-129; Akomah, B.B., Jackson, E.N., Contractors' Perception of Factors Contributing to Road Project Delay (2016) International Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 5, pp. 79-85; Ameh, O.J., Osegbo, E.E., Study of Relationship between Time Overrun and Productivity on Construction Sites (2011) International Journal of Construction Supply Chain Management, 1 (1), pp. 56-67; Subramani, T., Lishitha, P., Kavitha, M., Time Overrun and Cost Effectiveness in the Construction Industry (2014) International Journal of Engineering Research and Applications, 4, pp. 111-116; Pirabahar, S., Vijay, P., Vairamuni, T., A Study on Cost and Time Overrun and Its Preventive Measures in Building Construction Projects (2017) SSRG International Journal of Civil Engineering, pp. 452-455; Raykar, P., Ghadge, A., Analyzing the Critical Factors Influencing the Time Overrun and Cost Overrun in Construction Project (2016) International Journal of Engineering Research, 5, pp. 21-25; Gunduz, M., Nielse, Y., Özdemir, M., Quantification of Delay Factors Using the Relative Importance Index Method for Construction Projects in Turkey (2013) Journal of Management in Engineering, 29 (2), pp. 133-139; Soputan, G.E.M., Sompie, B.F., Mandagi, R.J.M., Manajemen Risiko Kesehatan Dan Keselamatan Kerja (K3) (Study Kasus Pada Pembangunan Gedung SMA Eben Haezar) (2014) Jurnal Ilmiah Media Engineering, 4, pp. 229-238; Gunduz, M., Yahya, A.M.A., (2015) Analysis of Project Success Factors in Construction Industry; (2004) Risk Management, , A.

Then analysing the cost saved from applying the value engineering in the architecture work of a high rise building. Calculation through the value engineering process was conducted. A commercial high rise building in Bali was chosen as a case study to implement the value engineering process in the design stage. The value engineering stages included calculating the cost/worth function, analysing through Function Analysis System Technique (FAST), innovation and creativity stage, evaluation of the life cycle cost, decision analysis and last the decision making. The research found that by applying value engineering through several items of work in a commercial high rise building it could save up to up to 8% of the total cost of the architecture work. The architecture work that was analysed through value engineering were the wall work, the door work, the floor work and the sanitary work. These were found to be the most effecting result from the Pareto calculation. The application of value engineering is this research was only done in one commercial high rise building in Bali. The work analysed was also only the architecture work. Therefore other types of construction project might result in different value of cost saving. This research identifies the cost saved through the application of value engineering in a commercial high rise building in Bali, which emphasizes on high quality materials in the architecture work.

Using integration of Geometric Information System (GIS) technology and urban storm water models, the performance of urban drainage system can be analysed.[1] Especially in coastal area, the main problem of urban drainage is overloaded capacity because of rapid urbanization and coastal floods caused by storm surges and wave action superimposed on high water levels generated during the cycle of tides. Land use change, watershed area as settlements area, clogged drainage pipe/channel, the changing of imperviousness of land cover also contributes to large volume of surface runoff. Moreover, the developments can change land cover in urban area and increasing rainfall runoff. One of the solutions for coastal urban drainage is by using polder system for flood control. The purpose of this paper is to illustrated how GIS can model the catchment discretization and MIKE URBAN-SWMM (Storm Water Management Model) can analyse water balance based on the rainfall return period of 25, 50 and 100 years. The research shows evaluation result of the polder performance including inundation depth and pump performance by linking GIS between storm water models. The case study is analysing the Pluit polder in Jakarta-Indonesia, which is connected to the Indonesia Central Bank compartment. Based on the model, this polder system can reduce flooding in Indonesia Central Bank Compartment up to 50%, however the inundation is still occurred. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In Indonesia there are several standards that are used to calculate the cost estimation of a project. One of the standards used in based on the Ministerial Regulation of Public Work No. 11/2013. However in a construction project, contractor often has their own cost estimation based on their own calculation. This research aimed to compare the construction project total cost using calculation based on the Ministerial Regulation of Public Work No. 11/2013 against the contractor's calculation. Two projects were used as case study to compare the results. The projects were a 4 storey building located in Pantai Indah Kapuk area (West Jakarta) and a warehouse located in Sentul (West Java) which was built by 2 different contractors. The cost estimation from both contractors' calculation were compared to the one based on the Ministerial Regulation of Public Work No. 11/2013. It is found that there were differences between the two calculation around 1.80 % - 3.03% in total cost, in which the cost estimation based on Ministerial Regulation was higher than the contractors' calculations. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","building contractor; construction project; cost estimation; ministerial regulation","Construction; Contractors; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Engineering research; Public works; Building contractors; Construction projects; Cost estimations; Indonesia; Jakarta; ministerial regulation; West javas; Cost estimating",,,,,,"Rad Parviz, F., (2001) Project Estimating and Cost Management.

The purpose of this paper is to propose an alternative maintenance strategy to be adopted by public-rented residential buildings to avoid the creation of slum conditions. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative and quantitative methods were adopted. The research first identified factors in maintenance management that affect the physical condition of a building through literature review and preliminary interview with the building occupants and building staffs. The factors are then used to develop a questionnaire that is distributed to 856 respondents in four buildings in East Jakarta. Only 552 completed questionnaires were used to identify the dominant factors through descriptive analysis by calculating the percentage of each answer. Findings: The research found that the dominant factors in maintenance management, which influence the creation of slums condition in public-rented residential building are the level of damage and quality deterioration of the building material and the level of building maintenance budget availability. Research limitations/implications: The maintenance situation and regulation regarding public-rented residential buildings in other provinces in Indonesia may not be the same with Jakarta Province due to the local autonomy and local problems. Therefore, the result from this research might not be applicable in other provinces in Indonesia. Originality/value: This research identifies the factors in maintenance management, which affect the creation of slum conditions in public-rented residential buildings so that necessary maintenance measures can be carried out by the agency in charge. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Jakarta; Maintenance; Property management; Residential building; Slums; Strategy",,,,,,,"Ali, A.S., Cost decision making in building maintenance practice in Malaysia (2009) Journal of Facilities Management, 7 (4), pp. 298-306; Chohan, A.H., Ani, S.D., Memon, A.W., Ishak, N.H., Zubair, D., Design liability towards building maintenance at post occupational stage (2010) Interdisciplinary Journal of Contemporary Research in Business, 2 (7), pp. 364-376; De Silva, N., Ranasinghe, M., De Silva, C., Risk factors affecting building maintenance under tropical conditions (2012) Journal of Financial Management of Property and Construction, 17 (3), pp. 235-252; (2013) The Regional Medium Term Development Plan of DKI Jakarta Province 2013 – 2017, , Library and Archives Agency of DKI Jakarta Province, Jakarta; (2012) Public-Rented Residential Building: A Commitment in Handling Slums Area, , Directorate General of Human Settlement, Jakarta; Gillham, B., (2000) Developing a Questionnaire, , Continuum, London; Hendaryono, S.M., (2010) Pekunden and Bandarharjo public-rented residential building management evaluation in Semarang, , Master thesis, Diponegoro University, Semarang; Lai, A.W.Y., Lai, W.M., User’s satisfaction survey on building maintenance in public housing (2013) Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management, 20 (4), pp. 420-440; (2007) Ministerial Regulation of Public Housing No. 14 2007: Public-Rented Residential Building Management, , Ministry of Public Housing, Jakarta; (2011) Ministerial Regulation of Public Housing No. 13 2011: Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Public Housing 2010 – 2014, , Ministry of Public Housing: Jakarta; (2008) Ministerial Regulation of Public Work No. 24 2008: Building Maintenance and Treatment Guidance, , Ministry of Public Work, Jakarta; Myeda, N.E., Kamaruzzaman, S.N., Pitt, M., Measuring the performance of office buildings maintenance management in Malaysia (2011) Journal of Facilities Management, 9 (3), pp. 181-199; Oladapo, A.A., A study of tenants’ maintenance awareness, responsibility and satisfaction in institutional housing in Nigeria (2006) International Journal of Strategic Property Management, 10, pp. 217-231; Olanrewaju, A.L., Building maintenance management in Malaysia (2009) Journal of Building Appraisal, 4 (3), pp. 207-214; Olanrewaju, A.L., Case for alternative approach to building maintenance management of public universities (2010) Journal of Building Appraisal, 5 (3), pp. 201-212; Olanrewaju, A.L., Quantitative analysis of defects in university buildings: user perspective (2012) Built Environment Project and Asset Management, 2 (2), pp. 167-181; Olanrewaju, A.L., Abdul-Aziz, A.R., (2015) Building Maintenance Processes and Practices: The Case of a Fast Developing Country, , Springer, Singapore; Olubodum, D.F., Mole, T., (1997) The impact of tenants of public housing stock maintenance expenditure in the UK, pp. 643-653. , 13th Annual ARCOM Conference, Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, Cambridge; Richardson, B.A., (2001) Defects and Deterioration in Buildings, , Spon Press, London; Singh, R., Mangat, N.S., (1996) Elements of Survey Sampling, , Springer-Science+Business Media, Punjab; Zawawi, E.M., Kamaruzzaman, S.N., Ali, A.S., Sulaiman, R., Assessment of building maintenance management in Malaysia: resolving using a solution diagram (2010) Journal of Retail & Leisure Property, 9 (5), pp. 349-356","Arumsari, P.; Faculty of Engineering, Indonesia; email: parumsari@binus.edu",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,2044124X,,,,"English","Built Environ.

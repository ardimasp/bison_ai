The Indonesian Statistics Bureau data showed that accidents involving motorcycles were dominated by young age. In line with government regulations, this paper discusses safety riding behavior among college students. A questionnaire distributed to college students and obtained 228 valid respondents with average age were 21 years old (71% male, 29% female). The questionnaire consists general information, driving attitude tendency (RA), safety driving (SR) behavior, riding knowledge (RK), and emotional intelligence (EI). This study showed that SR tendency of college students is moderate. A driving license(s) owned (DL) influence the riding knowledge (RA) with p-value=0.004. However, RA, SR, and EI are not different between age, gender and study years. Using a binary logistic regression, SR level predicted well by RA (p-value=0.000) with 93.3% accuracy. Based on this study, the participants with good RA, 1.185 times more likely will have good SR level. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","Driving attitude; Driving knowledge; Emotional intelligence; Safety Riding","Accidents; Emotional intelligence; Laws and legislation; Logistic regression; Surveys; Average ages; Behavior tendencies; Binary logistic regression; College students; Driving license; General information; Government regulation; Indonesia; Students",,,,,"(2018) Statistik Transportasi Jakarta 2018, , https://jakarta.bps.go.id/publication/2018/10/03/cb1285d8dbe8be8754a5830d/statistik-transportasi-dki-jakarta-2018.html, 03 10 Online.Available: Accessed 25 01 2020; Issa, Y., Effect of driver's personal characteristics on traffic accidents in tabuk city in Arabia (2016) The Journal of Transport Literature, pp. 25-29; White, M.J., Cunningham, L.C., Titchener, K., Young driver' optimism bias for accident risk and driving skill: Accountability and insight experience manipulations (2011) Accident Analysis and Prevention, pp. 1309-1315; Lucidi, F., Mallia, L., Gainnini, A.M., Sgalla, R., Lazuras, L., Chirico, A., Alivernini, F., Vionani, C., Riding the adolescence: Personality subtypes in young moped riders and their association with risky driving attitudes and behaviors (2019) Frointier Pshychology, 10 (300), pp. 1-12; Wedagama, D.M.P., The Influence of Young and Male Motorist accidents – Factors on Motorcycle Injuries in Bali- (2009) IATSS Research, 3 (2); Simmons, W.O., Welki, A.M., Zlatoper, T.J., The impact of driving knowledge on motor vehicle fatalities (2016) JTRF, 55 (1); Cordellieri, P., Sdoia, S., Ferlazzo, F., Sgalla, R., Giannini, A.M., Driving attitudes.

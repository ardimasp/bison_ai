This study to analyze the relation of food safety knowledge and behavior practices on the young adult who buys food online. The study participants were 104 undergraduate college students whom digital technologies users and experienced with e-commerce and social media. Respondents were clustered into four clusters: No Food safety knowledge, low, medium and high. Methodologies used were cluster analysis with average linkage and Ward's method. The first result shows female respondents have food safety knowledge higher than male. Second, majority respondents have low to medium food safety knowledge. Third, with low to medium food safety knowledge and triggering factor saving time, majority respondent buy food through direct food producers websites. Fourth, the decision-making factor to buy food online are equal between attractive advertisement and repeat order. Finally, indicated the study population overall has poor knowledge of food safety this implicate threat food borne. As a result, awareness and food safety educational initiatives campaigns should be developed to better inform young adults about safe food practices and habits in buying food online. © 2017 IEEE.","average linkage; cluster analysis; consumer behavior; food safety; food shop online; ward's method","Cluster analysis; Consumer behavior; Decision making; Occupational diseases; Safety factor; Students; Average linkage; College students; Digital technologies; Food producers; Social media; Triggering factors; Virtual shops; Ward's method; Food safety",,,,,"Indonesian Internet Service Provider Association, , https://www.apjii.or.id/, Press release; Van der Veer, L., Real food from virtual shops a case study from the netherlands (2012) European Food and Feed Law Review, 1, pp. 3-13; Manning, L., Mechanisms for assessing food safety risk (2013) British Food Journal, 115 (3), pp. 460-484. , 2013; Johnson, R.A., Wichern, D.W., (1992) Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis, , Third Edition.

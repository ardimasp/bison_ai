However, expanding business to a new business lines requires a comprehensive considerations. Complexity of decision-making not only lies in the uncertainty or the imperfections of information, but involves many criteria and sub-criteria used to rank the alternatives of a decision. The purpose of this study is to understand the best solution on whether or not the light weight bricks being produced by 'X'. Hence, this study applied the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and Decision Tree Analysis (DTA) as the rational decision making tools may help 'X' to decide whether or not to invest in the new business line. The results based on data processing AHP of directors and general managers indicate that the 'X' has a tendency to decide to make the light weight bricks. While based on the DTA shows that the 'X' will benefit if it decides to make the light weight bricks. © 2016 IEEE.","Analytic Hierarchy Process; Decision Tree Analysis; Expected Monetary Value; Light weight bricks; Multi-criteria","Analytic hierarchy process; Brick; Data handling; Decision trees; Hierarchical systems; Information management; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Decision tree analysis; Expanding business; Expected monetary values; Light weight; Multi-criteria; Production decisions; Rational decision making; Decision making",,,,,"Saaty, T.L., Vargas, L.G., Models, methods, concepts & applications of the analytic hierarchy process (2012) International Series in Operations Research & Management Science, 175. , Springer Science+Business Media New York; Heizer, J., Render, B., (2011) Operation Management, , 10th ed., New Jersey; Vidal, L.-A., Marle, F., Bocquet, J.-C., Using a delphi process and the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) to evaluate the complexity of projects (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 38 (5), pp. 5388-5405; Dey, P.K., Project risk management: A combined analytic hierarchy process and decision tree approach (2002) Cost Engineering, 44 (3), pp. 13-27; Battistoni, E., Colladon, A.F., Scarabotti, L., Schiraldi, M.M., Analytic hierarchy process for new product development (2013) International Journal of Engineering Business Management, 5; Liao, W.-H., Qiu, W., Applying analytic hierarchy process to assess healthcare-oriented cloud computing service systems (2016) SpringerPlus, 5 (1), p. 1030; Harjanto, E., Manajemen Operasi (2008) Cetakan Ketujuh, Jakarta",,,"BINUS Univerity;IEEE Indonesia Section;Wiley","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2016","16 November 2016 through 18 November 2016",,127842,,9781509033522,,,"English","Proc.

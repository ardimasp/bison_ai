The technology development has challenged how education was brought to learners. The traditional way may no longer fit the demand. This research aimed to investigate the critical success factors in blended learning for English Training. Systematic literature review was established to reach the conclusion. 30 journal articles published in 2013 to 2017 were examined to gain the results and findings. The result showed there were 11 key success factors in delivering the English training by blended learning. The most critical factors were the course design of blended learning, the instructional model of blended learning, and the teaching learning method in the blended learning course. It was suggested in the future to emphasize the research on the various designs of blended learning, the tools for the online sessions, and the suitable teaching learning method in the blended learning course. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Enterprise resource planning; Learning systems; Teaching; Blended learning; Critical factors; Critical success factor; Instructional model; Key success factors; Systematic literature review; Teaching-learning method; Technology development; Curricula",,,,"Binus University","This research paper was funded by the research grant from Bina Nusantara University.","Luke, J.Y., Putri, M.R., Sela, S.T., The expectation of faculty on english language skills study through online learning (2017) Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Information and Education Technology Unpublished Paper; Jokinen, P., Mikkonen, (2013) Nurse Education in Practice, 13 (6), pp. 524-528; Precel, K., Alkalai, Y.E., Alberton, Y., (2009) International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, 10 (2), pp. 1-16; Al-Qahtani, A., Higgins, S.E., (2013) Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 29 (3), pp. 220-234; Gedik, N., Kiraz, E., Ozden, M.Y., (2013) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 29 (1), pp. 1-19; Banditvilai, C., (2016) The Electronic Journal of E-Learning, 14, pp. 220-229; Kitchenham, B., (2004) Technical Report, , (Keele University); Kitchenham, B., (2009) Information and Software Technology, 51 (1), pp. 7-15",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Advance and Scientific Innovation, ICASI 2018","23 April 2018 through 24 April 2018",,148653,17426588,,,,"English","J.

On the other hand, in higher education level the students should produce a thesis to complete their study. Facilitating the students to be ready for the thesis writing, English for Academic Writing course was delivered to the students. Research-based teaching method was implemented in the course in order to help the students improved their writing skills as well as the critical thinking skills. The purpose of this research was to investigate the impact of the research-based teaching method toward the students' critical thinking skills in writing. Case study was implemented to reach the conclusion. Fifty (50) Global Class students majoring in Information System were observed to gain the result. Questionnaire result was used to support the observation data. The result showed there was improvement in students' critical thinking in academic writing after joining the class. Further, the result also found the method may help the students sharpen their 21st Century skills such as collaboration and communication. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

People can study whenever and wherever based on their availability and interest. The growth of e-learning in higher education has developed rapidly to accommodate the issue. This paper aimed to find out the key success factors of e-learning in higher education. Systematic Literature Review was conducted to reach the finding. 54 journal articles were examined to gain the result. The examined journal articles were published between 2006 up to 2016. The result showed that there were 17 key critical success factors of e-learning in higher education. The most critical factor was the IT infrastructure or the learning management system (LMS) followed by e-learning tools and e-learning models. The result also revealed that there was a paradigm shifting in learning process from traditional way. It was suggested the future focus of this research area to emphasize the implementation of LMS in e-learning so that e-learning in higher education can be implemented well. © 2017 IEEE.","CSFs; e-learning; higher education; SLR","Enterprise resource planning; Information management; Critical success factor; CSFs; E-learning models; Higher education; IT infrastructures; Key success factors; Learning management system; Systematic literature review; E-learning",,,,,,"Barak, M., Watted, A., Haick, H., Computers & Education Motivation to learn in massive open online courses: Examining aspects of language and social engagement (2016) Computers & Education, 94, pp. 49-60. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2015.11.010; Arkoful, V., Abaidoo, N., (2014) The Role of E-learning, the Advantages and Disadvantages of Its Adoption in Higher Education, 2 (12), pp. 397-410; Anderson-Meger, J., (2011) Critical Thinking and E-Learning in Social Work Education, 1 (2), pp. 17-27; Ahmad, Z., Alabaddi, A., Rahahleh, A.H., Al-Omoush, M.M., (2016) Blended E-Learning Constraints from the Viewpoint of Faculty Members, 11 (7), pp. 180-190. , http://doi.org/10.5539/ijbm.v11n7p180; Alazmi, M., Zairi, M., (2017) Total Quality Management & Business Excellence, 3363. , http://doi.org/10.1080/1478336032000051386, January; Alhomod, S., Alsadhan, A.O., Shafi, M.M., (2014) The 3C' S Model: A Framework for Development of E-Learning Courses, 7 (1), pp. 87-93. , http://doi.org/10.5539/cis.v7n1p87; Alowayr, A., Badii, A., (2014) Review of M Onitoring Tools for E-learning Platforms, 6 (3), pp. 79-86. , http://doi.org/10.5121/ijcsit.2014.6306; Alsabawya, A.Y., Cater-Steel, A., Soar, J., IT infrastructure services as a requirement for e-learning system success (2013) Computers & Education, , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.035; Al-Samarraie, H., Teo, T., Abbas, M., Computers & Education Can structured representation enhance students' thinking skills for better understanding of E-learning content?

There are two kinds of English language skills to aim, the skills related to academic writing and TOEFL preparation. To identify the required skills to be improved aligned with the expectation, questionnaires have been spread through online to collect data from faculty members in all majors. Collected data consists of faculties’ identification, the learning difficulties, the expectation and the required skills. The result shows the required skills that are possible to be learned through online and the expectations of the faculties that are realistic to be fulfilled. The result will be used to develop online English language trainings to improve the required skills of faculty. © 2018 ACM.","Academic Writing; English Language Training; Expectation of Faculty; Online Learning; TOEFL Preparation","Surveys; Academic writings; English languages; Expectation of Faculty; Online learning; TOEFL Preparation; E-learning",,,,,,"Lemos, S., Pedro, N., (2012) Students' Expectation and Satisfaction in Post-Graduate Online Courses, , http://www.icicte.org/Proceedings2012/Papers/14-3Lemos.pdf; Mann, V.A., (1984) Reading Skill and Language Skill, , http://www.haskins.yale.edu/sr/sr069/SR069_10.pdf; Hismanoglu, M., Teaching english through literature (2005) Journal of Language and Linguistic Studies, 1 (1). , http://www.jlls.org/index.php/jlls/article/viewFile/6/7, (April.2005); Akkaya, N., Kirmizi, F.S., Relationship between attitudes to reading and time allotted to writing in primary education (2010) Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, 2, pp. 4742-4746. , https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82750187.pdf, 2010; Gholaminejad, R., Moinzadeh, A., Youhanaee, M., Ghobadirad, H., Writing attitudes of iranian efl students: A qualitative study (2013) Journal of Language Teaching and Research, 4 (5), pp. 1138-1145. , http://dx.doi.org/10.4304/jltr.4.5.1138-1145, September.2013; Griffiths, C., (2004) Studying in English: Language Skills Development, , http://www.crie.org.nz/research-papers/c.griffiths_op5.pdf; Aydogan, H., Akbarov, A.A., The four basic language skills, whole language & integrated skill approach in mainstream university Classrooms in Turkey (2014) Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences, 5 (9). , http://dx.doi.org/10.5901/mjss.2014.v5n9p672, (2014); Salma, U., Problems and practical needs of writing skill in efl context: An analysis of iranian students of Aligarh Muslim University (2015) IOSR Journal Of Humanities And Social Science (IOSR-JHSS), 20 (11), pp. 74-76. , http://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jhss/papers/Vol20issue11/Version-3/L0201137476.pdf, Ver.

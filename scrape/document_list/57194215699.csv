The service aims to satisfy the patients' requirements, which must be done by one or more qualified staff visiting them within the right time and minimising operational cost. The homecare staff-scheduling problem (HSSP) is an extension of the HHC problem involving planning routes for caregivers visiting n patients. This paper proposes the route scheduling system based on a genetic algorithm approach for solving the HSSP. The focus is to introduce the novel techniques consisting of adaptive-opt (OPT), external k-nearest neighbour swapping (EKN), and internal nearest neighbour search (INN) to incorporate with the GA while also increasing the performance for solving the HSSP. In addition, the trade-off ratio between the percentage of improvement and the execution time is also concerned. The ratio provides the most suitable structure of the proposed GA that can continue to consider other issues for HHC service such as the dynamic scheduling that requires execution speed for recalculating the service plan when some service activities are cancelled immediately. Our empirical study reveals that the proposed techniques can produce improved solutions on two simulated datasets and an adapted case study instance compared to the original GA. © 2019 IEEE.","Genetic algorithm; Homecare service; Local search; Route scheduling; Two-part chromosome","Cloud computing; Economic and social effects; Home health care; Local search (optimization); Nearest neighbor search; Scheduling; Genetic algorithm approach; Home-care services; K-nearest neighbours; Local search; Local search techniques; Nearest neighbour search; Scheduling systems; Two-part chromosomes; Genetic algorithms",,,,,"Felici, G., Gentile, C., A polyhedral approach for the staff rostering problem (2004) Management Science, 50 (3), pp. 381-393; Bard, J.F., Purnomo, H.W., Preference scheduling for nurses using column generation (2005) European Journal of Operational Research, 164 (2), pp. 510-534. , 7/16/; Topaloglu, S., Selim, H., Nurse scheduling using fuzzy modeling approach (2010) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 161 (11), pp. 1543-1563. , 2010/06/01; Bredström, D., Rönnqvist, M., Combined vehicle routing and scheduling with temporal precedence and synchronization constraints (2008) European Journal of Operational Research, 191 (1), pp. 19-31; Constantino, A.A., Landa-Silva, D., De Melo, E.L., De Mendonça, C.F.X., Rizzato, D.B., Romão, W., A heuristic algorithm based on multi-assignment procedures for nurse scheduling (2014) Annals of Operations Research, 218 (1), pp. 165-183. , 2014//; Redjem, R., Marcon, E., Operations management in the home care services: A heuristic for the caregivers' routing problem (2016) Flexible Services and Manufacturing Journal, 28 (1), pp. 280-303; Cai, X., Li, K.N., A genetic algorithm for scheduling staff of mixed skills under multi-criteria (2000) European Journal of Operational Research, 125 (2), pp. 359-369. , 9/1/; Sinthamrongruk, T., Harnpornchai, N., Determination of optimal number of doctors and appointment interval for an appointment (2015) Information Engineering and Education Science, IRAICS Proceedings, pp. 379-389. , CRC Press; Hadwan, M., Ayob, M., Sabar, N.R., Qu, R., A harmony search algorithm for nurse rostering problems (2013) Information Sciences, 233, pp. 126-140. , 6/1/; Todorovic, N., Petrovic, S., Bee colony optimization algorithm for nurse rostering (2013) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 43 (2), pp. 467-473; Akjiratikarl, C., Yenradee, P., Drake, P.R., PSO-based algorithm for home care worker scheduling in the UK (2007) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 53 (4), pp. 559-583; Gao, S.-C., Lin, C.-W., Particle swarm optimization based nurses' shift scheduling (2013) Proceedings of the Institute of Industrial Engineers Asian Conference 2013, pp. 775-782. , Y.-K.

Healthcare staff members provide daily medical services at patients' homes. The service provider authority has to schedule these staff in an effective and efficient way so that it achieves the minimum total cost. The aim of this study is to propose an Adaptive Local Search based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve Healthcare Staff Routing Problem. Two new types of Adaptive Local Searches have been proposed to explore the optimal solutions. Also, Immigrant Scheme has been applied to improve the performance of the proposed GA. With this feature, we make an effort to motivate the GA to replace population occasionally by calling the best GA chromosome when the GA struggles at the local optimal solution. By the proposed algorithm, an effective routing schedule for staff members is generated. Our empirical study demonstrates that the proposed GA with Adaptive Local Search and Immigrant Scheme outperforms its rival methods in terms of the sum of distances. © 2017 IEEE.","adaptive genetic algorithm; adaptive local search; constructive scheduling; healthcare service; k-mean algorithm","Health care; Local search (optimization); Optimal systems; Optimization; Routing algorithms; Scheduling; Traveling salesman problem; Adaptive genetic algorithms; Healthcare services; K-mean algorithms; Local optimal solution; Local search; Optimal solutions; Real-world scheduling; Travelling salesman problem; Genetic algorithms",,,,,"Aurora, F.C.L., A model for community nursing in a rural county (1974) Operational Research Quarterly (1970-1977), 25 (2), pp. 231-239; Felici, G., Gentile, C., A polyhedral approach for the staff rostering problem (2004) Management Science, 50 (3), pp. 381-393; Bard, J.F., Purnomo, H.W., Preference scheduling for nurses using column generation (2005) European Journal of Operational Research, 164 (2), pp. 510-534. , 7/16; Topaloglu, S., Selim, H., Nurse scheduling using fuzzy modeling approach (2010) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 161 (11), pp. 1543-1563. , 2010/06/01; Bredström, D., Rönnqvist, M., Combined vehicle routing and scheduling with temporal precedence and synchronization constraints (2008) European Journal of Operational Research, 191 (1), pp. 19-31; Constantino, A.A., Landa-Silva, D., Melo, E.L., Mendonça, C.F.X., Rizzato, D.B., Romão, W., A heuristic algorithm based on multi-assignment procedures for nurse scheduling (2014) Annals of Operations Research, 218 (1), pp. 165-183. , 2014; Cai, X., Li, K.N., A Genetic Algorithm for scheduling staff of mixed skills under multi-criteria (2000) European Journal of Operational Research, 125 (2), pp. 359-369. , 9/1; Hadwan, M., Ayob, M., Sabar, N.R., Qu, R., A harmony search algorithm for nurse rostering problems (2013) Information Sciences, 233, pp. 126-140. , 6/1; Todorovic, N., Petrovic, S., Bee colony optimization algorithm for nurse rostering (2013) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 43 (2), pp. 467-473; Akjiratikarl, C., Yenradee, P., Drake, P.R., PSO-based algorithm for home care worker scheduling in the UK (2007) Computers &Industrial Engineering, 53 (4), pp. 559-583; Gao, S.-C., Lin, C.-W., Particle swarm optimization based nurses' shift scheduling (2013) Proceedings of the Institute of Industrial Engineers Asian Conference 2013, pp. 775-782. , Y.-K.

There is an urgent need to help MMAF for producing more accurate fish catches data. This paper proposed a system that utilizes computer vision, fuzzy logic and Global Positioning System (GPS) for supporting a sustainableIndonesian fishery by recognizing and measuring fish length, determine fish age and where is the catch location. The system can help authority to manage sustainable fisheries management in Indonesia. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Fish Management; Fuzzy Logic; Huhate; Machine Learning","Computer circuits; Computer vision; Fish; Fisheries; Global positioning system; Learning systems; Fish catch; Fish length; Fish management; Huhate; Indonesia; Sustainable fishery; Fuzzy logic",,,,"12/AKM/PNT/2019, 225/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019, 039/VR","Authors wishing to acknowledge the support from the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of PenelitianUnggulanPerguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled ―Perancangan Algoritma Untuk Pengenalan Ikan Cakalang, Tongkol dan Lemadang Otomatis Hasil Tangkapan Nelayan Huhate di Bitung, Manado‖ or ―Design of Algorithm for Automatic Skipjack, Tongkol, and Lemadang Recognition of Fishermen using Huhate in Bitung, Manado‖ with contract number: 225/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019, 12/AKM/PNT/2019, 039/VR.RTT/IV/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","Prasmadji, N., Pudjiastuti, S., (2016) Fishing Industry Indonesia: Leading Tuna Producer, Concern about Overfishing, , https://www.indonesia-investments.com/id/news/todays-headlines/fishing-industry-indonesia-leading-tuna-producer-concern-about-overfishing/item6835, [Online] [Accessed: 23-Aug-2019]; (2019) Trade Map, International Trade Centre, , https://www.trademap.org/Index.aspx, Anonymous [Online]; Anderson, L.G., (2004) The Economics of Fisheries Management; Firman, M., Aria, P., (2017) Tuna Indonesia Terancam Punah Dalam 3-10 Tahun, , https://katadata.co.id/berita/2017/02/17/tuna-indonesia-terancam-punah-dalam-3-10-tahun, [Online]; Diniah, D., (2001) Pemanfaatan Sumberdaya Tuna-Cakalang Secara Terpadu; Suprianto, D., Reppie, E., Budiman, E., Daerah penangkapan ikan dari kapal huhate yang berpangkalan di Pelabuhan Perikanan Pantai Belang (2013) Jurnal Ilmu Dan Teknologi.

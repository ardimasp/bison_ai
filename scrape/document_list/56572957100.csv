The performance of such system strongly depends on its feature extraction methods. So far, many extraction methods have independently been studied and proposed, and the three widely adopted methods are Geometric Moment Invariant (GMI), United Moment Invariant (UMI), and Zernike Moment Invariant (ZMI). This study is performed to understand the relative performance of the three methods. For this purpose, the methods, in conjunction with Support Vector Machine classifier with RBF, and PuK kernels, are used to recognize characters taken from Char75K dataset. In addition, the combined features of GMI-UMI, GMI-ZMI, UMI-ZMI, and GMI-UMI-ZMI are also studied. The numerical results suggest the following. Among the three extraction methods, GMI, UMI, and ZMI methods, the latter two methods tend to provide better results by about 7-8% than the GMI method. Generally, when the features are combined, the results improve rather significant, about 7-8% improvement. Only the pair of GMI and UMI combination provide small or negligible improvement. Using the RBF kernel, GMI features alone result in 63% accuracy, UMI features alone 70% accuracy, and GMI-UMI combination result in 72% accuracy. Combination of UMI-ZMI features improve the accuracy significantly than each method along. We also find that the combination of the three methods, GMI-UMI-ZMI, tend to increase the accuracy significantly. The accuracy reaches the level of 96% for the RBF kernel and 89% for the PuK kernel. © 2016 IEEE.","Geometric Moment Invariant (GMI); Support Vector Machine (SVM); United Moment Invariant (UMI); Zernike Moment Invariant (ZMI)","Classification (of information); Extraction; Feature extraction; Radial basis function networks; Support vector machines; Feature extraction methods; Geometric moment; Handwriting recognition; Moment invariant; Numerical results; Relative performance; Support vector machine classifiers; Zernike moment invariants; Character recognition",,,,,"Rashad, M., Amin, K., Hadhoud, M., Elkilani, W., Arabic character recognition using statistical and geometric moment features (2012) Electronics, Communications and Computers (JEC-ECC), 2012 Japan-Egypt Conference on, pp. 68-72. , IEEE; Wang, Y., Peyls, A., Pan, Y., Claesen, L., Yan, X., A fast selforganizing map algorithm for handwritten digit recognition (2013) Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering, pp. 177-183. , Springer; El-Feghi, I., Elmahjoub, F., Alswady, B., Baiou, A., Offline handwritten Arabic words recognition using zernike moments and hidden markov models (2010) Computer Applications and Industrial Electronics (ICCAIE), 2010 International Conference on, pp. 165-168. , IEEE; Hu, M.-K., Visual pattern recognition by moment invariants (1962) Information Theory, IRE Transactions on, 8 (2), pp. 179-187; Flusser, J., Suk, T., Zitova, B., (2009) Moments and Moment Invariants in Pattern Recognition, , John Wiley and Sons; Huang, Z., Leng, J., Analysis of hu's moment invariants on image scaling and rotation (2010) Computer Engineering and Technology (ICCET), 2010 2nd International Conference on, 7, pp. V7-476. , IEEE; Yinan, S., Weijun, L., Yuechao, W., United moment invariants for shape discrimination (2003) Robotics, Intelligent Systems and Signal Processing, 2003.

The main challenges are handwriting dynamicity and various forms or shapes of alphabet. Thus, computer requires several complex processes which are image processing, feature extraction and alphabets recognition. This research proposes an offline Handwritten Alphabets Recognition (HAR) automated system using Twelve Directional feature extraction and Self Organizing Maps (SOM) clustering algorithm to effectively recognize the type of alphabets. The proposed HAR system has three components: 1) preprocessing: which consists of grayscale image conversion, binarization and thinning, 2) feature extraction: that based on twelve directional feature input, and 3) clustering: using SOM algorithm. Experiments have been conducted on primary dataset and secondary dataset from benchmarked chars74k dataset. The results have shown that it produces encouraging recognition performance with 90% accuracy (for 150 secondary data) and 87.69% (for 150 primary data). This indicates that the proposed system can be an alternative solution to efficiently recognize the handwritten alphabets. © 2014 IEEE.","Chars74K Dataset; Handwritten Alphabets Recognition; Self Organizing Maps; Twelve Directional Feature Extraction","Automation; Character recognition; Clustering algorithms; Conformal mapping; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image processing; Alternative solutions; Automated systems; Chars74K Dataset; Complex Processes; Directional feature; Gray-scale images; Handwritten Alphabets Recognition; Off-line handwritten; Self organizing maps",,,,,"Tay, Y.H., Khalid, M., Comparison of fuzzy artmap and mlp neural networks for hand-written character recognition (1997) International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) Symposium on Artificial Intelligent in Real -Time Control; Sumedha, B.H., Geeta, D.S., Twelve directional feature extraction for handwritten english character recognition (2013) International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering (IJRTE), 2 (2), pp. 39-42; Singh, D., Singh, S.K., Dutta, M., Hand written character recognition using twelve directional feature input and neural network (2010) International Journal of Computer Application, pp. 82-85; Agarwal, P., Hand-written character recognition using kohonen network (2011) International Journal of Computer Science and Technology (IJCST), 2 (3), pp. 112-115; Jain, A.K., Murty, M.N., Flynn, P.J., Data clustering: A review (1999) ACM Computing Surveys, 31 (3); Pradeep, J., Srinivasan, E., Himavathi, S., Neural network based handwritten character recognition system without feature extraction (2011) Internationl Conference on Computer and Electrical Technology (ICCCET), pp. 40-44. , Tamilnadu,18-19 March; Shih, F.Y., (2010) Image Processing and Pattern Recognition Fundamentals and Technique; Raman, N.K., Gandhi, S., Khurana, J., Study and analysis of devnagari handwritten character recognition techniques (2013) International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR), 2 (6), pp. 475-479; Heaton, J., (2007) Introduction to Neural Networks for Java (2nd Edition), , United States of America: Heaton Research, Inc; Murty, M.N., Jain, A.K., Flynn, J.P., Data clustering: A review (1999) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), pp. 264-323",,"Latifah A.L.Sadikin R.","IEEE Indonesian Section;Indonesia Ministry of Communication and Informatics;Research Center for Informatics, Indonesian Institute of Sciences","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2014 International Conference on Computer, Control, Informatics and Its Applications, IC3INA 2014","21 October 2014 through 23 October 2014",,111017,,9781479945757,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

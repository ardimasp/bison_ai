Despite previous articles on BMI on large companies, the research on business model innovation on small medium enterprises (SMEs) remains limited. This paper gives insights on BMI for SMEs, analyzes the methodology and unit analysis, and provides future directions. The method used for this research is literature review by collecting and analyzing Scopus articles from 2014 until 2020. This paper then conducted a review on the driving factors of BMI, the influence of external factors, as well as the tools and strategic ways for improvement. © 2020 SERSC.","Business Model Innovation; Literature Review; SMEs",,,,,,"Ammar, O., Chereau, P., Business model innovation from the strategic posture perspective: An exploration in manufacturing SMEs (2018) European Business Review, 30 (1), pp. 38-65. , https://doi.org/10.1108/EBR-09-2016-0119; Bouwman, H., Molina-Castillo, F.-J., de Reuver, M., Business Model Innovation in European SMEs: Some preliminary findings (2016) 29Th Bled Econference: Digital Economy, BLED 2016., , http://aisel.aisnet.org/bled2016/9, Retrieved from; Clauss, T., Bouncken, R.B., Laudien, S., Kraus, S., Business Model Reconfiguration and Innovation in SMEs: A Mixed-Method Analysis from the Electronics Industry (2020) International Journal of Innovation Management, 24 (2). , https://doi.org/10.1142/S1363919620500152; Reuver, M., Athanasopoulou, A., Haaker, T., Roelfsema, M., Riedl, A., Breitfuss, G., Designing an ICT tooling platform to support SME business model innovation: Results of a first design cycle (2016) 29Th Bled Econference: Digital Economy, BLED 2016, pp. 556-570; Gatautis, R., Vaiciukynaite, E., Tarute, A., Impact of business model innovations on SME’s innovativeness and performance (2019) Baltic Journal of Management, 14 (4), pp. 521-539. , https://doi.org/10.1108/BJM-01-2018-0035; Guo, H., Tang, J., Su, Z., Katz, J.A., Opportunity Recognition and SME performance: The mediating effect of business model innovation (2016) R&D Management, pp. 1-12. , https://doi.org/10.1111/radm.12219; Heikkilä, J., Heikkilä, M., Innovation in Micro, Small and Medium Sized Enterprises: New Product Development (2017) Business Model Innovation and Effectuation. 30TH BLED ECONFERENCE, pp. 197-214; Hock-Doepgen, M., Clauss, T., Kraus, S., Cheng, C.F., Knowledge management capabilities and organizational risk-taking for business model innovation in SMEs (2020) Journal of Business Research, (March), pp. 0-1. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.12.001; Liao, S., Liu, Z., Ma, C., Direct and configurational paths of open innovation and organisational agility to business model innovation in SMEs (2019) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 31 (10), pp. 1213-1228. , https://doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2019.1601693; Marolt, M., Lenart, G., Maletič, D., Borštnar, M.K., Pucihar, A., Business model innovation: Insights from a multiple case study of Slovenian SMEs (2016) Organizacija, 49 (3), pp. 161-171. , https://doi.org/10.1515/orga-2016-0015; Miroshnychenko, I., Strobl, A., Matzler, K., de Massis, A., Absorptive capacity, strategic flexibility, and business model innovation: Empirical evidence from Italian SMEs (2020) Journal of Business Research, pp. 1-13. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.02.015; Müller, J.M., Business model innovation in small-and medium-sized enterprises: Strategies for industry 4.0 providers and users (2019) Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, 30 (8), pp. 1127-1142. , https://doi.org/10.1108/JMTM-01-2018-0008; Pangaribuan, C.H., Putra, O.P., Lesthary, L., Aguzman, G., Hidayat, D., The Analysis of Potential Growth for Indonesia’s Micro Small Medium Business Owners International Journal of Business Studies, pp. 62-73; Pucihar, A., Lenart, G., Borštnar, M.K., Vidmar, D., Marolt, M., Drivers and outcomes of business model innovation-micro, small and medium-sized enterprises perspective (2019) Sustainability, 11 (2). , https://doi.org/10.3390/su11020344; Pucihar, A., Marolt, M., Vidmar, D., Borštnar, M.K., Lenart, G., Business Model Innovation in SMEs in Slovenia.

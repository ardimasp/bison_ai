Internships are important because they introduce students to the world of work, so that students not only learn theory, but also practice. The current condition where the world is hit by the Covid 19 pandemic makes many students unable to physically intern. Students cannot come to work and to clients due to social distancing. Augmented reality is one of the solutions so that students can get an augmented internship experience. This research is a descriptive qualitative research. In this study, we present data in the form of literature reviews and observations regarding the use of augmented reality in providing internship experiences to students who specialize in the field of auditing science. The results of our research state that augmented reality is more widely used in providing augmented experiences, students can gain work experience without having to meet people physically, however, some challenges must also be considered in augmented development and augmented reality in audit learning, including: content problems, content development costs are still expensive, and also the issue of health problems after usage. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

Companies publish sustainability reports as well as financial and annual reports. This sustainability report creates a need, namely the need for audits for sustainability reports. This is often referred to as a sustainability audit or assurance report. It is a qualitative descriptive survey. Researchers collect data from the literature and study observations as well as from interviews with stakeholders. The results of our study were obtained because the increasing number of public companies reporting on sustainability requires sustainability reporting audits in Indonesian public companies.

This study used the stock returns data for 60 days around 50 split events of publicly traded stock on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2010 to 2015. This study found an anomaly pattern of stock prices with the ex-date as the peak and a positive average return that could not be explained by the general market movement. The cross-sectional regression of the conservative capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and three other factors failed in explaining the ex-date return anomalies. The results of the empirical model indicate that ex-date return anomalies were not related to a firm’s operating performance but were strongly related to the split factor, weakly related to trading volume, and also weakly related to the market value. Overall, these findings support the trading range/liquidity hypothesis. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Event study; Market reaction; Stock split",,,,,"Binus University","The authors would like to thank the Management Department of the Binus Business School that always gives full support in areas of research and publication, along with thanks to the Research Technological Transfer Office Department of Binus University that provided the funding for conference registration and travel accommodations.","Brennan, M.

It when companies report large profits, people become asked whether this is really real profit or profit that is intentionally made for a particular purpose. Departing from this, we made a study of income smoothing in the mining sector. Mining sector is one sector that is classified as profitable for people; this sector can be called an opportunist and opportunist sector often associated with earnings management and income smoothing. Our research is quantitative research. We use secondary data, financial statements of mining companies for the past five years. We use path analysis for the analysis tools in this study. We use three moderator variables, namely: institutional ownership, managerial ownership and audit committee. We examine the three moderator variables whether they can moderate profitability and leverage on income smoothing. The results of our study state that profitability influences income smoothing. In addition managerial ownership is able to moderate profitability and leverage, while the audit committee is only able to moderate profitability on income smoothing. © IAEME Publication Scopus Indexed","Company; Corporate; Governance; Income; Mining; Smoothing",,,,,,,"Herda, D.

The next generation of entrepreneurs, prospective entrepreneurs in the future, need to plan and implement technology to adapt to change. This research aims to find out what factors affect entrepreneurial students' interests and behaviour. This analysis is quantitative causality. As a grand theory we use UTAUT 2 Model. The data collection process uses primary data, which distributes questionnaires to students taking business classes. Testing hypothesis in this study uses a path analysis approach for structural equations modelling. We used statistical tools in data processing. The findings of our study show that varying results, perceptions of effort, social impact, circumstances, price values, behavioural intentions are affected. Though hedonic motivation has little effect on behavioural intent. Facilitating circumstances and behaviours often has a partly beneficial impact on the actions of usage. Conduct intent has a positive effect on the conduct of use. © 2020 EManuscript Technologies.

Forensic accounting becomes one of the solutions to detect this fraudulent statement. On the basic of our premise, the purpose of research to explore empirical evidence regarding financial statement fraud detection factors with net worth method as control variable. Our independent variables were debt to equity ratio, change in net assets, and return on asset. The research was quantitatively on food and beverage manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. We use financial statement year end audited from 2013-2017. We used purposive sample, when selecting the samples. Total of 55 company reports samples were used in this research. We analyzed the data using statistical multiple linear regression analysis. We used statistical software to do the regression, in order to answer the research questions and test the hypothesis. Fraudulent reporting fraud was examined using proxies Beneish M-score. After the statistical test, this research concludes that financial distress factor proxy Debt to Equity Ratio (DER) has no significant effect on fraud detection. Other factor that is financial stability was proxies by changes in total assets (ACHANGE), and financial targets in the proxy of Return on Assets (ROA) both have significant impact on the detection of financial statement fraud. © BEIESP.","Beneish M Score; Detection; Factor; Forensic; Fraudulent; Statement",,,,,,,"(2019) Report to the Nations 2018 Global Study on Occupational Fraud and Abuse; Survai Fraud di Indonesia (2017) Indones.

The background of writing this essay is because Indonesia will be affected by the Industrial Revolution 4.0 which will cause jobs to disappear, emerge and change. This research is directed to solve the solutions that occur in millennial accountants in making strategies to deal with these changes by paying attention to conditions in the 4.0 era where technology has developed rapidly and is living side by side with humans. Technology that has developed rapidly is certainly not an obstacle for millennial generation accountants to get a job. One technology that is booming is Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI Began to become a part of work activities at the start of the Industrial Revolution 4.0. With this advanced technology, all things can be handled well and is a helper for today's companies in processing large amounts of data. Therefore, many people assume that the role of accountants will be replaced by machines. But if you look further, it is the lack of skills and information regarding the operation of the technology that causes new accountants such as millennial generation to feel threatened by the presence of technology. By learning more about the accounting profession in the future, accountants can collaborate with machines to advance life as a unit of valuable assets. All of this was done so that they could remain competitive and not be left behind in the rapid development of technology. ©BEIESP.","Accountant; Artificial intelligence; Industry revolution 4.0; Millennial; Professional",,,,,,,"Sommer, L., Industrial revolution-Industry 4.0: Are German manufacturing SMEs the first victims of this revolution?

The auditor must examine the report or bookkeeping company. When conducting its audit work, auditors are required to have competence in accounting or finance and always maintain an independent attitude. Even so, until now there are still many people who doubt the competence and independence of public accountants. This is compounded by the many cases involving the public accounting profession, in many financial statement fraud cases that occurs worldwide such as the Enron, Phar-Mor, Crazy Eddie case. This study aims to analyze in order to obtained statistical result regarding how auditor work experience, understanding of Good Governance (GG), independence of auditor influenced quality of the audit result. The sample in our study was obtained by using a purposive sampling method for certified auditor firm in the Jakarta Special Capital Region. We have 200 auditors as our respondents from various audit firms. Hypothesis testing is done by using ordinary least square. We used determination of coefficient, t test and f test. On the conclusion, we have evidence that good governance variable significantly influences audit quality, while work experience variables and independence variable do not significantly influence audit quality. Our study also stated that all the independent variables give influence magnitude 64.8 percent for explaining quality of audit. © BEIESP.","Audit quality; Auditor; Corporate governance; Experience; Good; Independence; Work",,,,,,,"Handoko, B.L., Widuri, R., Sarjono, H., The effect of third party auditor and quality of service through cloud storage security to cloud user trust (2017) 2017 9Th IEEE Int.

Audit delay causes financial statements to be inhibited for publication. This causes the users of financial statements to wait longer to be able to use financial statements as a tool in decision making. The purpose of this research is to empirically examine the effect of company size, liquidity, profitability, solvability, and audit firm size towards audit delay on property and real estate companies that listed on Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2014-2018. This research is a quantitative study that tests the hypothesis, whether there is the influence of independent variables on the dependent variable. This study uses the ordinary least square method Statistical test used is the coefficient of determination test, partial t test and simultaneous f test. The selection of research samples using purposive sampling method. The sample of this research consists of 46 companies with 5 years of research so total of the research objects amounting 230 data. The data analysis method used in this research is panel data regression analysis using E-views version 10. Based on the results of partial test, profitability and audit firm size have significant effect on audit delay. Company size, liquidity, and solvency do not have a significant effect on audit delay. Simultaneous test result showed that company size, liquidity, profitability, solvability, and audit firm size simultaneously affect audit delay. The results of this study indicate that if the auditor wants to minimize audit delay, they must pay more attention to clients' profitability and consider the size of the company, the size of the audit's scope of work. © BEIESP.","Audit Firm Size; Company size; Liquidity; Profitability; Solvability",,,,,,,"McKinnie, M., (2016) Cloud Computing: TOE Adoption Factors by Service Model in Manufacturing,”, p. 131; Kieso, T.D.D.E., (2011) J.

The study was conducted by field observations and interviews with 30 potato farmers in Tawangmangu, Central Java. There are two common supply chains, namely supply chains without company intervention and supply chains with a mix of corporate hands. This study chooses supply chain design ranging from purchasing seed farmers, buying, to selling. Supply chains are interconnected and have different interests. The application of supply chains without company intervention is still considered ineffective and inefficient for farmers. Future research can improve this research with more detailed cost details.

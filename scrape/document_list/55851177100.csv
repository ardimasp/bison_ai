In everyday life, there is a lot of need to predict something. For example, when you want to determine which items someone wants to buy or estimate the results of football matches or predict the rating of a movie. It's better if we can sell something that is in accordance with the wishes of the customer. Therefore, algorithm predictions are needed that can produce predictions accurately and precisely. In this paper, algorithm predictions are presented with prior data concepts, where data will be divided into 2 parts, training and testing dataset. There are 5 stages in the Priori Prediction (PP) algorithm starting from the data input process, checking the similarity of data, calculating using the difference function, calculating the predictive score, then evaluating using MAE. PP algorithm is also compared with other recommender system algorithms, which are collaborative filtering, cosine similarity, and content-based filtering in experiments and evaluations. The test results show that the proposed algorithm has satisfactory performance compared to other recommender system. © 2019 IEEE.","football score prediction; item rating; prediction algorithm; recommender system","Collaborative filtering; Forecasting; Information management; Sports; Statistical tests; Content based filtering; Cosine similarity; Data input; Difference functions; Prediction algorithms; Priori predictions; Training and testing; Recommender systems",,,,,"Mirshahvalad, R., Zanjani, N.A., Diabetes prediction using ensemble perceptron algorithm (2017) 2017 9th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks, pp. 190-194; Oana, L., Spataru, A., Use of genetic algorithms in numerical weather prediction (2016) 18th International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing, pp. 456-461; Sespajayadi, A., Indrabayu, Nurtanio, I., Technical data analysis for movement prediction of euro to usd using genetic algorithm-neural network (2015) 2015 International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications, pp. 23-26; Shibu Kumar, K.B., Susheela Devi, V., Rajeev, K.K., Bhatia, A., Probabilistic algorithms for election result prediction (2014) 2014 International Conference on Soft Computing & Machine Intelligence, pp. 79-82; Haojun, Q., Tao, Z., Jichang, G., Task scheduling prediction algorithms for dynamic hardware/software partitioning (2012) 2012 Fifth International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms and Programming, pp. 80-85; Zhou, D., Wu, X., Zhao, W., Lawless, S., Liu, J., Query expansion with enriched user profiles for personalized search utilizing folksonomy data (2017) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 29 (7), pp. 1536-1548; Du, Q., Xie, H., Cai, Y., Leung, H., Li, Q., Min, H., Wang, F.L., Folksonomy-based personalized search by hybrid user profiles on multiple levels (2016) Neurocomputing, 2014, pp. 142-152. , Apr; Xue, D., Wang, Y., Applying cosine similarity to discount evidence (2017) 2017 10th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design (ISCID), 1, pp. 516-519; Sun, B., Dong, L., Dynamic model adaptive to user interest drift based on cluster and nearest neighbors (2017) IEEE Access, 5, pp. 1682-1691; Yang, J., Leskovec, J., Defining and evaluating network communities based on ground-truth (2012) 12th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining; Leskovec, J., Sosic, R., Snap: A general-purpose network analysis and graph-mining library (2016) ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), 8 (1), pp. 1-20; Aarhof, M., (2018) Football Data, , https://datahub.io/collections/football.[Accessed:21-Nov-2018]; Jain, S., Grover, A., Singh Thakur, P., Kumar Choudhary, S., Trends, problems and solutions of recommender system (2015) International Conference on Computing on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA2015)",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","4th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2019","19 August 2019 through 20 August 2019",,152147,,9781728133331,,,"English","Proc.

IoT fit objects will be interconnected through wired and wireless communication technologies. It makes demand high. One of the solutions using cognitive radio (CR) for better utilization, CR has spectrum sensing to find unoccupied channel and occupied channel. This study using Eigen Moment Ratio (EMR) for better utilization than Energy Detection (ED). The evaluation shows EMR better than ED, because EMR using a new formula eigenvalue to detect.

Since 2010, there have been many complaints on network performance such as slow connections or frequent break up of connections. Although the configuration and network capacity has been regularly fixed and upgraded, the complaints keep on repeating. The current study is formulated by using multiple case methodologies such as data retrieval by using SNMP polling tools, Access Point (AP) Monitoring, Syslog, and field measurements. It is noted that the distance factor, the number of users and signal strength do not influence the speed with an average of 4,769 Kbps for download and 874 Kbps for upload. However the roaming activity occurring in WLAN is equal to 30% of 10,418 roaming events, which in turn lead to the slow speed of the connections. © 2013 IIJ.","Access point monitoring; Network analyzer; Snmp polling; Syslog; Wireless traffic",,,,,,"Lockwood, J.W., ""Implementation of Campus-Wide Wireless Network Services Using ATM, virtual LANs, and Wireless Basestation"" (1999) Proceeding of IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC 1999), 2, pp. 603-605; Hills, A., Wireless Andrew [mobile computing for university campus]"" (1999) IEEE Spectrum, 36 (6), pp. 49-53; Zhiwen, Y., Yunji, L., Bukan, X., Yue, Y., Bin, G., ""Towards a Smart Campus with Mobile Social Networking"" (2011), pp. 162-169. , Proceeding of International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings/CPSCom) and 4th International Conference on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing; Papadopouli, M., Haipeng, S., Raftopoulos, E., Ploumidis, M., Hernandez-Campus, F., ""Short-Term Forecasting in a Campus-Wide Wireless Network"" (2005) Proceeding of IEEE 16th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC 2005), 3, pp. 1446-1452; Schwab, D., Bunt, R., ""Characterising the Use of a Campus Wireless Network"" (2004) Proceeding of 23rd Annual/Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies (INFOCOM 2004), 2, pp. 862-870; Kortz, D., Essien, K., ""Analysis of a Campus-Wide Wireless Network"" (2005) J.

Fraud in BPJS Kesehatan can be the source of loss if it not anticipated very well. Fraud can happen because of bad registration, no transparency in the data and minimum monitoring from third party outside the insurance components. This research consist of analysis and design of the fraud possibilities can be minimize and anticipated as much as possible. Blockchain is one of alternative method approach that can be applied for this matter because blockchain is good to analyze Big Data. Blockchain registered records by distributions, so that with the good records registration and distributed can minimize the possibility of the fraud. Based on the analysis result, identification and design that been made, proposed several actors, participants also activity process for each actor, business process, data requirement and transaction process that can minimize fraud in BPJS Kesehatan system. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

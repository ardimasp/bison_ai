A lot of studies have been done to understand the effects of knowledge creation on performance. Although there are a lot of empirical research related with knowledge creation, but the review on the research direction of knowledge creation is still limited. This paper gives insight on knowledge creation and performance, analyzes the empirical research, and provide future direction. The method used for this research is literature review by collecting and analyzing empirical Scopus articles from 2014 until 2020 by using two keywords: 'knowledge creation' AND performance also SECI AND performance. Result shows that research in knowledge creation has been done in various countries and industries, with the term knowledge creation process and SECI indicators widely used to represent knowledge creation. More research is still needed to show how knowledge creation affects performance. © 2020 IEEE.","Knowledge creation; Knowledge creation process; Literature review; Performance","Competitive strategy; Empirical research; Empirical studies; Knowledge creations; Literature reviews; Information management",,,,,,,"Sin, A.B., Zailani, S., Iranmanesh, M., Ramayah, T., Structural equation modelling on knowledge creation in six sigma dmaic project and its impact on organizational performance (2015) Intern.

The lesson learnt can be captured through the formulation of strategy that needed to consider internal and external aspects. For example, as in the digital world, customer experience as well as customer satisfaction. Capability on the side of the network owned combined with network and social capabilities are expected to create distinctive organizational capability. Based on this background, the study aims to examine the effects of customer experience and distinctive organizational capability on the business model innovations of telecommunication firms in Indonesia using quantitative research. The target population are 445 telecommunication network companies in Indonesia which includes 312 ISP firms, 34 satellite firms, 27 tower firms, and 72 Telkom subsidiaries and affiliates, with samples taken from 34 firms. PLS is used as the analytical tool to process the data in this study. The results of the study show that customer experience and distinctive organizational capabilities have an influence to business model innovations. Customer experience has a bigger role than distinctive organizational capability in building business model innovation. These findings have practical implications for the management of telecommunications industries in Indonesia as the development of vocational training rely on the needs of business model innovation development, which directly based on the development of customer experience and supported with development of distinctive organizational capability. Further research can be explored by expanding the sample, industry and in other countries. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.","Business model innovation; Customer experience; Distinctive organization capability; Telecommunication industry",,,,,,,,"Abdelkafi, N., Makhotin, S., Posselt, T., Business Model Innovations for Electric Mobility — What Can Be Learned from Existing Business Model Patterns?

The authors seek to examine the technological impact as part of digital transformation antecedents of CX and OA in developing DSI. The study also aims to investigate the digital transformation model to attain a more sustainableICT performance in Indonesia. The novelty of this study lies in the identifying and testing the concurrent effects of studied variables in improving the understanding of DSI and SP as part of the Indonesian ICT digital transformation model. The study used a sample of 195 Indonesia ICT firms. The finding from PLS-SEM reveals that GIS has a significant moderating role in accelerating the development ofDSI on the relationship with CX and OA, while SP is positively and significantly influenced by CS, OA and DSI. The implication and the proposed of digital transformation model for Indonesian ICT firms is also discussed in this paper. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Information services;

It was supported by the strength of existing firms, which is corporate reputation. The concept of co-creation-innovation itself is based on the theory of service dominant (S-D) logic. Past studies have focused on the critical elements of co-creation (CC) and digital service innovation (DSI), as well as corporate reputation (CR) in shaping a sustainable performance (SP). However, the study of co-creation-innovation and CR and its relationship to green environment has not been intensively explored. This study has aim to oversee the role of Green Information System (GIS; Green IS) in the development of corporate reputation and co-creation-innovation in order to attain sustainable performance. The study was conducted using a sample size of 195 respondents representing Indonesian telecommunication firms. Smart PLS was used as the statistical tool for analyses. Findings demonstrate that green IS directly and indirectly has a significant relationship on corporate reputation, CC and DSI. However, CR has a direct impact on CC but no direct impact on DSI. The limitations and implications of the current study and recommendations for future study is also discussed in this paper. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Information systems; Information use; Statistical mechanics; Corporate reputations; Critical elements; Digital service innovations; Green environments; Green information systems; Service-dominant (S-D) logic; Sustainable performance; Telecommunication firm; Information services",,,,,,,"Lusch, R.F., Nambisan, S., Service innovation: A service-dominant logic perspecive (2015) MIS Quarterly, 39 (1), pp. 155-175; Vargo, S.L., Lusch, R.F., (2014) The Service-Dominant Logic of Marketing, pp. 21-46; Barrett, M., Davidson, E., Prabhu, J., Vargo, S.L., Service innovation in the digital age: Key contributions and future directions (2015) MIS Quarterly, 39 (1), pp. 135-154; Vargo, S.L., Lusch, R.F., Service-dominant logic: Continuing the evolution (2008) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 36 (1), pp. 1-10; Walsh, G., Mitchell, V.W., Jackson, P.R., Beatty, S.E., Examining the antecedents and consequences of corporate reputation: A customer perspective (2009) British Journal of Management, 20 (2), pp. 187-203; Blaschke, M., Haki, K.M., Riss, U.V., Winter, R., Aier, S., (2016) Digital Infrastructure: A Service-dominant Logic Perspective Association for Information Systems; Grönroos, C., Value co-creation in service logic: A critical analysis (2011) Marketing Theory, 11 (3), pp. 279-301; Shrivastava, P., Effect of Co-creation on Customer Experience, Trust and Brand Loyalty (2016) International Journal of Sales & Marketing Management Research and Development, 6, p. 1; Sjödin, C., Kristensson, P., Customers' experiences of co-creation during service innovation (2012) International Journal of Quality and Service Sciences, 4 (2), pp. 189-204; Dean, A.M., Griffin, M., Kulczynski, A., Applying service logic to education: The co-creation experience and value outcomes (2016) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 224, pp. 325-331; Galvagno, M., Dalli, D., Theory of value co-creation: A systematic literature review (2014) Managing Service Quality, 24 (6), pp. 643-683; Payne, A.F., Storbacka, K., Frow, P., Managing the co-creation of value (2008) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 36 (1), pp. 83-96; Sebhatu, S.P., (2010) Corporate Social Responsibility for Sustainable Service Dominant Logic; Iglesias, O., Markovic, S., Bagherzadeh, M., Singh, J.J., Co-creation: A key link between corporate social responsibility, customer trust, and customer loyalty (2018) Journal of Business Ethics, pp. 1-16; Ciasullo, M.V., Troisi, O., Cosimato, S., How Digital Platforms Can Trigger Cultural Value Co-Creation?-A Proposed Model (2018) Journal of Service Science and Management, 11 (2), p. 161; Stevens, E., Boucher, R., Designing Co-Creation Platforms (2016) In Istec, pp. 1-11; Martínez, P., Del Bosque, I.R., Sustainability dimensions: A source to enhance corporate reputation (2014) Corporate Reputation Review, 17 (4), pp. 239-253; Das, K., Gryseels, M., Sudhir, P., Tan, K.T., (2016) Unlocking Indonesia's Digital Opportunity; Chandler, J.D., Lusch, R.F., Service systems: A broadened framework and research agenda on value propositions, engagement, and service experience (2015) Journal of Service Research, 18 (1), pp. 6-22; Zhang, Y., How Smart, Connected Products Are Transforming Companies (2015) Blog.

We argue that the concept of strategy has shifted from the competitive strategy into co-creation strategy based on collaboration value. In developing co-creation strategy, the input is derived from external factors associated with customer experience and internal factors related to distinctive capabilities and both focus on core competence development in supply chain management. We use telecommunication firms as our unit analysis with sample of 35 Indonesian Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) firms analysed using Partial Least Square (PLS). The findings show that the developing of co-creation strategy was supported by distinctive capabilities and customer experience. The findings also indicate that co-creation strategy emerges as a key in sustaining business of the firms to focus on developing customer experience and providing distinctive capabilities. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Co-creation strategy; Customer experience; Distinctive capabilities; Supply chain",,,,,,,,"Bolton, R.N., (2016) Service Excellence: Creating Customer Experiences that Build Relationships.

This research focuses on the problem to motivate employees to share their knowledge and use KMS. Bina Nusantara University in Indonesia becomes the object of the research since the university has implemented KM Portal system. Furthermore, the university has run the KM Award as the reward system. The research method of this study implements a Point Incentive System on the KM Portal for a year and compares the impact with the previous reward system. The reward system used were 1) KM Award System (2018) and 2) Point Incentive System (2019), each of which has been used for one year. This study focuses on comparing the two systems. The research applies quantitative research methodology to measure the number of user contributors and the number of contents in the system. When the numbers show an increase, then this is regarded as the indicator of success. The results show an increase in the number of user contributors by 34.92% and the number of contents by 68.85% stored on the KM Portal. This shows that the application of the KM Point Incentive System is more successful in promoting employees’ motivation to use KMS. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The growth of SMEs has made little contribution to Indonesia export value while their business orientation is ready to export in real data. The purpose of this study is to analyse the mediating effect of the Internationalisation process on knowledge management and export towards SMEs Export Performance. The research strategies used include the associative quantitative method where the data collection method consists of a survey distributed to 154 Export-Oriented SMEs respondents while data analysis technique incorporates path analysis using double regression method. The results show that the internationalisation process has a mediating effect on knowledge management and the dynamic capabilities that affect SMEs export performance. Knowledge management and dynamic capabilities have a direct impact on SMEs export performance. The value of mediating effect is lower than its direct effect, showing that the internationalisation process enhances the effect of knowledge management and dynamic capabilities towards SMEs export performance. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Dynamic capabilities; Export performance; Internationalisation process; Knowledge management; Mediating effect",,,,,,,,"Management influences on export performance: A review of the empirical literature 1978-1988 (1989) International Marketing Review, 6 (4), pp. 7-26; Strategi produk untuk mengatasi hambatan ekspor UKM industry kerajinan Indonesia (2015) Jurnal Manajemen & Bisnis Sriwijaya, 13 (1), pp. 39-53; Knowledge management and the innovation performance in a high-tech SMEs industry (2011) International Small Business Journal, pp. 1-18; Internationalization of small-and medium-sized enterprises: A multi case study (2010) European Business Review, 22 (6), pp. 608-623; International new ventures: Rapid internationalization across different industry contexts' (2014) European Business Review, 26 (5), pp. 390-405. , https://doi.org/10.1108/EBR-05-2014-0040; Determinants and measures of export performance-comprehensive literature review (2014) Journal of Contemporary Economic and Business Issues, 1 (1), pp. 63-74; Export market-oriented behaviour and export performance: Quadratic and moderating effects under differing degrees of market dynamism and internationalization (2009) Journal of International Marketing, 17 (4), pp. 71-89; 29 Tantangan Internasionalisasi Ukm Di Indonesia Dalam Menghadapi Masyarakat Ekonomi (2015) Journal Kajian, 27 (9), pp. 129-144; Marketing strategy-performance relationship: An investigation of the empirical link in export market ventures (1994) Journal of Marketing, 58, pp. 1-21; The Determinants of Export Performance: A Review of the Literature 2006-2014 (2016) International Marketing Review, 33 (5), pp. 626-670; Information, knowledge and collaboration management in the internationalisation of SMEs: A systematic literature review (2016) International Journal of Information Management, 36 (4), pp. 557-569; The emergence, advance and future of international entrepreneurship research: An introduction to the special forum (2011) Journal of Business Venturing, 26 (6), pp. 625-631; Institutional theory and institutional change: Introduction to the special research forum (2002) The Academy of Management Journal, 45 (1), pp. 43-56; Viewpoint-Export Performance Measurement: Reflective Versus Formative I˙ndicators (1999) International Marketing Review, 16 (6), pp. 444-457; Knowledge management in SMEs: A literature review (2012) Journal of Knowledge Management, 16 (6), pp. 879-903; Dynamic capabilities and Knowledge Management: An integrative role for learning?

Digital technology has become an enabler in the innovation of business models. New capabilities are required to be developed, especially for incumbent firms, since new entries have more agility in establishing new business models to create value. Even though the incumbent firms have strong reputation, they need to develop new distinct capabilities to create value in the long run. The fastest way to develop new capabilities is through collaboration also known as co-creation. Co-creation is a form of economic strategy to bring mutual values from different parties as a mediating role in creating business model innovations. Since there are limited study on co-creation strategy in relation to corporate reputation and business model innovation, this paper aims to assess the mediating role of co-creation strategy on the relationship between business model innovation and corporate reputation. The unit of analysis is taken from Indonesian telecommunication firms with sample of 35 firms out of 445 firms using purposive sampling method. Smart PLS (Partial Least Square) is used as the analytical approach and solution in the study. Research results reveal that corporate reputation has an indirect effect on business model innovation, but a direct effect on co-creation strategy. Co-creation strategy also plays significant effect to business model innovation. Co-creation strategy is a moderator variable between business model innovation and corporate reputation. The paper provided insight that the enhancement of corporate reputation should be directed towards building co-creation strategy which will then help strengthen business model innovation article. © 2019, Penerbit UTHM.

The way organizations manage resources and capability, especially in relationship with people, culture and process in creating new business models have changed. Previous studies on developing innovation based on customer experience and agility of organization focus on the concept, relationship among variables and the implication. However, in the context of industry 5.0, the study on those topics has not been revealing. Hence, this study aims to assess the concept of experience-agility innovation model to support transformation in the context of digital transformation to face Industry 5.0. The proposed model was assessed with 195 Indonesia ICT firms using SEM-PLS statistical tools. The findings demonstrate that the firm that offers compelling value proposition from customer experience while concurrently developing agility in the organization to create business model innovation could boost the transformational performance. For further researches, the study can be enhanced through expanding the model, sample, and time. © BEIESP.","Business model innovation; Customer experience; Industry 5.0; Organizational agility; Transformational performance",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, MHE&SR

The platform service becomes critical in order to collaborate and innovate based on organizational agility and customer experience. Co-creation-driven innovation is considered as part of the service dominant development, where a dynamic organization model and customer experience feedback are required in the shaping of business model innovations within the digital ecosystem. The study was performed with a sample size of 175 respondents representing Indonesian telecommunication firms. Smart PLS was used as the statistical tool for analyses. Findings demonstrate that customer experience orientation and organizational agility has a direct impact on digital co-creation and business model innovation. Simultaneous testing of hypotheses shows that customer experience orientation has an indirect influence on business model innovation through co-creation strategy. However, organizational agility does not have any indirect impacts. The study has some limitations in terms of the time period and sample size, therefore suggestions for future studies are included in the paper. © BEIESP.","Business model innovation; Customer experience orientation; Digital co-creation; Organizational agility; Service dominant logic",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, MHE&SR

Hence, this paper examines the roles of digital leadership in developing strategic alliance and dynamic capability based on the market orientation. It is put forward that digital leadership behaviors have a stronger influence on the development of strategic alliance in order to drive dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. A quantitative method was used, comprising 88 senior leaders of Indonesian telecommunication companies. Purposive sampling method was used with the Smart PLS statistical tool. The findings confirm the direct and indirect significant effects between digital leadership and the development of strategic alliance and dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. The study has practical implications to take priority in developing digital leadership to enforce the transformation. The limitations of the study are identified to be the sample, time and statistical tool used, hence longitudinal study is suggested in the future with a more extended sample quantity and time frame. © 2019, Czestochowa University of Technology.

The market has become more dynamic due to new business model innovations offered by new entries in the industry. Incumbent firms require a digital transformation in order to have a more dynamic capability in shaping their existing business to fit the new paradigm. The fastest way of developing capabilities to align with the new paradigm is through collaboration with partners. Developing capabilities for innovation management and dynamic capabilities requires strong digital leadership to optimize the use of digital technology. The need for collaboration is urgent to accelerate the development process of innovation in the digital era, therefore, this study uses collaboration as its moderating variable. Most published research focusing on digital transformation examines digital leadership, innovation dynamic capabilities based on construct, applicability and benefit, and the role of collaboration. However, the role of digital leadership in driving innovation management and dynamic capability has not been intensively explored nor specifically the influence of collaboration. This study was conducted through a survey of 88 senior leader respondents from Indonesian telecommunication firms using a purposive sampling method. The statistical data was processed using Smart-PLS application for analyses. Findings demonstrate that innovation management moderated by collaboration had a significant influence in accelerating the relationship between digital leadership and dynamic capabilities. It is also found that digital leadership had a direct and indirect impact on the development of dynamic capability. This indicates that digital leadership actually had a strong role in driving the transformation. These findings have practical implications to support the theory that collaboration is a critical factor in the digital era. It supports the role of firm management in strengthening digital leadership capabilities in conjunction with the development of innovation management with a focus on co-creation values in developing dynamic capabilities. Recommendation for further research is also discussed in this paper. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Collaboration; Digital leadership; Dynamic capability; Innovation management",,,,,,,,"Al-Debei, M.M., The Design and Engineering of Innovative Mobile Data Services: An Ontological Framework Founded on Business Model Thinking (2010) Engineering, p. 288; Barney, J., Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Berman, S.J., Digital transformation: Opportunities to create new business models (2012) Strategy and Leadership, 40 (2), pp. 16-24. , https://doi.org/10.1108/10878571211209314; Bessant, J., Phillips, W., (2013) Innovation management and dynamic capability The Sage Handbook of Strategic Supply Manage-Ment: Relationships, Chains, Networks and Sectors, , http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/12488%5Cn; Bhattarai, K., Carter, M., An Empirical Analysis of the Taylor Rule and its Application to Monetary Policy: A Case for the United Kingdom and Euro Area (2018) Asian Journal of Economics and Empirical Research, 5 (2), pp. 173-182; Bhuia, M.R., Das, S., Rahman, K., Alam, K., Kawsar, L.A., Hossain, M., An Assessment of the Importance of Admission Test for Enrollments in Public Universities of Bangladesh (2016) Journal of Education and e-Learning Research, 3 (1), pp. 9-16; Bourne, M., Neely, A., Implementing Performance Measurement Systems: a literature review (2003), 5 (1), pp. 1-24; Carayannis, E.G., Sindakis, S., Walter, C., Business Model Innovation as Lever of Organizational Sustainability (2015) Journal of Technology Transfer, 40 (1), pp. 85-104; Chesbrough, H., Open Innovation: Where We've Been and Where We're Going (2012) Research-Technology Management, 55 (4), pp. 20-27; Cockburn, T., Smith, P.A.C., VUCA and the power of Emergence Teams.

The collaboration, service orientation, agility and customer experience become a critical in this dynamic environment. Hence, the firm strategy has shifted from a competition strategy to a col-laboration strategy. Collaboration with customers is effected through co-creation Strategy (CCS). It could enable the firms in accelerating digital transformation. This study of the development of co-creation strategy focuses on customer experience orientation (CXO) and organization agility (OA) to support transformational performance (TP) in terms of relationship among variables and an empirical study has been conducted. Hence, in this paper, we propose a model of digital transformation for ICT Industry based on co-creation of strategy focused on customer experience orientation and organization agility. The study is based on an empirical study of 195 Indonesian ICT firms.

Hence, the purpose of this paper is to examine what are the roles of digital leadership in developing strategic alliance and dynamic capability based on market orientation. We argue that digital leadership behaviors have a stronger influence on the development of strategic alliance to drive dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. A quantitative method is used comprising 88 senior leaders of Indonesian telecommunication. The purposive sampling methods is used with the statistical tool is Smart PLS. The findings confirm the significant influence directly and indirectly between digital leadership and the development of strategic alliance and dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. The study has practical implication to take the priority in developing of digital leadership in enforcing the transformation. the limitations of study could be identified as the sample, time and used statistical tools, hence the further study can be extended in term of sample quantity, time horizon to become longitudinal research. © 2019, Dorma Journals.

In doing so, the authors seek to examine the technological antecedents of customer experience (CUE) by examining the role of green information systems (GIS) and service innovation (SEI). Moreover, the study also aims to investigate the association of SEI and GIS with customer satisfaction (CUS) and hotels environmental performance (ENP). The novelty of the present study lies in identifying and testing the joint effects of the studied variables in improving the understanding of CUS and ENP in an existing complex environment. The results of PLS-SEM confirm that customer experience and ENP have a positive and significantly influenced by the GIS. Moreover, the results further suggested that customer experience and CUS have significantly and positively impacted by SEI. Finally, the results of PLS-SEM confirm that ENP and CUS have significantly and positively impacted by customer experience in multinational firms in Indonesia. © 2019, Econjournals.

The Indonesian market is unique in terms of its ICT infrastructure, but still left behind compared to other countries. However, the market has tremendous opportunities in terms of digital capability innovations. The strategic management outline used as a framework for this paper. Mediating variables were co-creation strategies and business innovations with distinctive organisational capability as an internal factor and consumer orientation as the external independent factor. The construct of co-creation strategy and transformational performance were discussed. This model of digital transformation was a suitable model for senior leaders to transform digital business capability and academics. Moreover, the model and construct of variable can be used to further develop the theory of digital transformation.

In addition to that moderating role of mutual trust is also examined. The study has broached the argument that knowledge sharing and transformational leadership style improves team performance. Findings of the current study suggest creativity is a process that starts in the team through the sharing of knowledge. The currents study is also of the view that the that the process of creativity starts in the situation when the team members share knowledge through coordination and it is also argued that the much of the knowledge is shared when team members meet to share knowledge in a given area, much of which is tacit. Sharing such tacit knowledge creates a flow of novel ideas that contribute to successful outcomes, such as new products, processes and patents. The findings of the study have shown agreement with the proposed or hypothesize results. The study has used PLS-SEM to analyses the data. The study will be helpful for policy makers in the researcher in understanding the issues related to supply chain, its integration, flexibility, and internal performance. © 2019, General Jonas Zemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania.","knowledge sharing; Leadership; Transformational",,,,,,,,"Avolio, B.J., Bass, B.M., Individual consideration viewed at multiple levels of analysis: A multi-level framework for examining the diffusion of transformational leadership (1995) The Leadership Quarterly, 6 (2), pp. 199-218. , https://doi.org/10.1016/1048-9843(95)90035-7; Basheer, M., Siam, M., Awn, A., Hassan, S., Exploring the role of TQM and supply chain practices for firm supply performance in the presence of information technology capabilities and supply chain technology adoption: A case of textile firms in Pakistan (2019) Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 7 (2), pp. 275-288. , https://doi.org/10.5267/j.uscm.2018.9.001; Bock, G.W., Kim, Y.-G., Breaking the myths of rewards: An exploratory study of attitudes about knowledge sharing (2002) Information Resources Management Journal (IRMJ), 15 (2), pp. 14-21. , https://doi.org/10.4018/irmj.2002040102; Burke, C.S., Sims, D.E., Lazzara, E.H., Salas, E., Trust in leadership: A multi-level review and integration (2007) The Leadership Quarterly, 18 (6), pp. 606-632. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2007.09.006; Casimir, G., Lee, K., Loon, M., Knowledge sharing: influences of trust, commitment and cost (2012) Journal of Knowledge Management, 16 (5), pp. 740-753. , https://doi.org/10.1108/13673271211262781; Cerneviciute, J., Strazdas, R., Teamwork management in Creative industries: factors influencing productivity (2018) Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Issues, 6 (2), pp. 503-516. , http://doi.org/10.9770/jesi.2018.6.2(3); Cheng, W., Hailin, L., Hongming, X., Does knowledge sharing mediate the relationship between trust and firm performance?

The current technology advancements empower companies to produce creativity and innovation to serve customer needs and expectation. To deliver this challenge, it requires the continuous breakthrough and innovation. To create organization innovation, employee plays the main key, as the main source and the executor of innovation. The organizational environment in knowledge-based industries, especially in the telecommunication industry, it is very dynamic and work activities tend to involve non-standard tasks and complicated non-routines. Routines carried out by organizations may not be able to respond quickly to rapid technological changes, or often experience technical problems that require fast and creative solutions. This study, focused on the innovative work behavior on employee perspective (creative self-efficacy and transformational leadership) and tested the digital literacy role on moderating the relationship between innovative work and employee performance.

Digital leadership will significantly enable sensing market changes, seizing opportunities, and reconfiguring organizations. Previous studies on digital leadership, dynamic capability, and innovation management focus mainly on constructs, benefits, and implications. However, a study on the role of digital leadership based on dynamic capability in fostering innovation and the impact of market orientation have not been thoroughly explored, which is the aim of this study, taking market orientation as a moderating variable. Employing a quantitative methodology, data were collected through online questionnaires, distributed through email and messaging applications to a purposive sample of 88 senior managers of Indonesian telecommunication firms. The results reveal that digital leadership based on dynamic capability impacts directly and indirectly on developing innovation. Market orientation also plays an important role in accelerating innovation. Due to limitations in terms of research model, sample size, and time, further research using larger samples in other industries and countries should be undertaken. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Digital leadership; Dynamic capability; Innovation management; Market orientation; Transformation model",,,,,,,,"Abiodun, B.Y., The Prospects of Accounting and Economic Systems in the Era of Global Knowledge Economy (2014) The Economics and Finance Letters, 1 (2), pp. 9-14; Ahmed, A., Rehan, R., Chhapra, I.U., Supro, S., Interest Rate and Financial Performance of Banks in Pakistan (2018) International Journal of Applied Economics, Finance and Accounting, 2 (1), pp. 1-7; Ali, A., Haseeb, M., Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology as a strategic tool towards higher performance of supply chain operations in textile and apparel industry of Malaysia (2019) Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 7 (2), pp. 215-226; Amfo, P., Cudjoe, G., Acheampong, G., Adams, M., Boakye, E., Market Orientation, Innovation and Business Performance: Insight from Womenpreneurs in the Fashion Industry in Ghana Market Orientation (2018) Journal of Creativity and Business Innovation, 4. , April; Arief, M., Basuki, Y.T., Dynamic capability as a business strategy enhancing the business performance (A conceptual approach) (2015) Advanced Science Letters, 21 (4), pp. 690-694; Basuki, Y.T., Arief, M., Propheto, A., The role of leadership, dynamic capabilities, and organization culture, in company performance of manufacturing industries in Indonesia (Study in food and beverages industries) (2015) Advanced Science Letters, 21 (5), pp. 1141-1145; Berman, S.J., Marshall, A., The next digital transformation: From an individual-centered to an everyone-to-everyone economy (2014) Strategy and Leadership, 42 (5), pp. 9-17; Bessant, J., Phillips, W., Innovation management and dynamic capability (2013) The Sage Handbook of Strategic Supply Manage-Ment: Relationships, Chains, Networks and Sectors, , http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/12488%5Cnhttp://www.sagepub.com/books/Book229482, Retrieved from; Breznik, L., Hisrich, R.D., Dynamic capabilities vs. Innovation capability: Are they related?

Digital transformations are required by Telecommunication firms to transform their portfolio beyond the pipeline to close the gap in business model innovations, redefine customer engagement and co-creation, and set up new distinctive organization capabilities. This paper has the objective to develop a digital transformation model by assessing the mediating role of co-creation strategy on the relationship between distinctive organizational capability and business model innovation. The units of analysis are Indonesian telecommunication firms, using a sample of 35 out of 445 telecommunication firms. The analytical approach used for analysis is Smart Partial Least Square (PLS).

This paper has the objective to provide the antecedents of business model innovation and compare the effects of corporate reputation and distinctive organizational capability in developing business model innovation. The study is based on the digital disruption phenomenon, where established companies are disrupted by the new entries with the new business model that leverages digital capability. The study focuses on information, communication and technology (ICT) of the incumbent companies in developing business model innovations as the second curve in sustaining the business. The ICT industry is an important sector in the development of other industries and has a significant influence on economic growth, which currently relies on emerging markets such as Indonesia. The Indonesian ICT market has unique characteristics where innovation grows rapidly, but infrastructure lacks behind and the market is very competitive. This creates a gap between innovation opportunities and development of digital infrastructure. As for the incumbent firms, the mitigation of risks of the investment of ICT infrastructure and competition with new entries with their new business model and market. Incumbent firms still have the advantage of corporate reputation and are required to develop distinctive capability. However, the study of developing business model innovations for incumbent firms in the market with a focus on corporate reputation is still limited. The current study is an empirical study using a sample of 35 Indonesian ICT firms. Smart Partial Least Square (SmartPLS) is the analytical approach and solution technique used in the study. Research findings show that the distinctive organization capability has more influence compared to corporate reputation in developing business model innovations. The study implicates on the theory that the development of business model innovations should focus on distinctive organization capabilities rather than relying more heavily on corporate reputation. This means that ICT Incumbent firms are required to transform their capabilities to align with market changes. In terms of management, the study also implicates the urgency in developing distinctive organizational capabilities in respective units, especially in intangible assets. Further research can be explored by expanding the research sample and industry conducting longitudinal study on the transformational model of incumbent firms. © 2018, Universidad del Zulia.

This paper aims to discuss how ICT firms could manage the transformational performance by integrating business model innovations and co-creation strategy. The construction model of transformational performance and co-creation strategy is expected to contribute to the theory of performance and co-creation reviewed in literatures based on the Indonesian ICT phenomenon. Indonesia’s ICT Industry has gained the attention to be studied since it is one of the emerging markets with unique market characteristics with numerous opportunities but lacking the digital infrastructure. The digital transformation is required for firms to be able to sustain their business. Measurement on the success of implementing the transformation is one of the key success factors. The construction of the transformational performance variable is driven from the theory of quality management, balance scorecards and digital maturity. The construct could contribute as a reference model to track the firms’ transformational performance. In digital transformation and disruptive era, business models and co-creation are key factors to drive performance. Co-creation is one of the business model innovations that is done through collaboration and partnerships. It is also an integrated strategy used in order to perform in the market. To elaborate the model, we develop a prototype using a sample of 35 senior leaders from Indonesian ICT firms. Partial Least Square (PLS) is the statistical tool used to analyze the data foo this study. The findings show that a firm’s transformational performance is significantly influenced by business model innovations and co-creation strategy. Further findings show that in digital transformation, a firm cannot fulfill all core capabilities as it requires collaboration and crowd sourcing. Our selected examples are only prototypes of the research model and implications of this study are limited to their particular context. Ultimately, our research model requires further research and validation, which should be done in future studies. © 2018, Universidad del Zulia.

Data were collected based on the four parameters of citizen document service, business permission service, planning transparency, and finance transparency. Each of these parameters will be evaluated with the score 0,1,2,3, or 4. Index of Reform (IR) is also calculated with the range 0 to 4. About 32 Websites samples are taken from the capital of provinces in Indonesia and non capital cities in Java. The result shows that only 15,6% websites having IR between 2.75 to 4.00 and city of Surabaya has the highest rank. Nationally, by combining the percentage of value 3 and 4 for each parameter, we obtain the percentage 18.75% for citizen service, 37.50% for business service, 25% for planning transparency, and 40.6% for finance transparency. Meanwhile, West Indonesia with 35.30%, 52.94%,35%, and 42% is higher than East Indonesia with 0%, 19.97%, 13.34%, and 40%. Based on corridor, for the citizen service and business permission., Corridor Java and Sumatera had the percentage of 45.45% & 17%, and 54.55%& 50% which are higher than other corridors. On the planning transparency, Sumatra corridor had the highest score of 50%, then follow by Java with 27%. But corridor Bali&Nusatenggara with 100% is the best on the finance transparency, follow by Java (46%) and Sumatera (34%). As a conclusion, PAR using e-Gov in Indonesia is still running slowly. West Indonesia, with Java and Sumatera corridors, is better than East Indonesia in e-Gov implementation. But for the finance transparency, corridor Bali&NusaTenggara of East Indonesia is the best. It is recommended that each city government enhance the static content and gradually move to the transaction content, such as for ID card which the order progress can be known online since the order submission. © 2015 The Authors.

Organizations are faced with a lot of product variants and better services from competitors and shorter product life cycles while the cost to produce the product or service is getting higher because of the additional cost required to innovate to anticipate the business competition. Organizations need to strengthen their organizational innovativeness through knowledge management capability and organizational learning capability to enhance sustainable competitive advantage.

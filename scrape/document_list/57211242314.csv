This work discussed a solution designed to solve common operational project problems, especially in attendance and tasklist management activity in companies who has employee working outside of the office. Considering the number of employees who have to visit various places, conventional attendance system is no longer feasible as be the solution. Similar problem occured in tasklist management, with so many employees to manage in different places will make it difficult for Project Manager to assign task and monitor the progress. Based on the problems, solusion was then designed using SDLC Waterfall using the field research data. This research conclude that by using the proposed application, complexity can be reduced and effectiveness can be improved in performing day-to-day operational task and make sure that they can be monitored. Moreover, the number of employee who responsible to make reports of projects and attendance can be reduced about 50%. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

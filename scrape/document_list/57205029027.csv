Therefore this study will advise to the future of development on the site to obtain the maximum value of land and building, which count The Highest and The Best Use of the site. The methods done by approach costs, where to analysis first market, a unit of which deportment in the area and how the odds, competitors. To tread in analysis potential on tread, training of tread. Analysis were based on aspects highest and best use but coupled with analysis architecture. The purpose of this research is to know what product will be built and how design in tread, and then functions in the area applied in the design overall with taking into account various aspects an architectural. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","architecture; function; Highest and Best Use; intensity","Functions; Product design; Highest and Best Use; Integrated areas; intensity; Jakarta; Land prices; Architecture",,,,,"Christono, A., (2013) The Highest analysis and Best Use (HBU) of Jalan Gubeng Raya No. 54 Surabaya; Bidaruni, A., Christiono, U., (2013) Analysis of land use Commercial area of Citra Raya Surabaya with the Highest method and Best Use; Finda, V.F., Christiono, U., (2014) The Highest and Best Use analysis on the dried land of the sun in the area of Surabaya II; Wateno, H., (2012) Market price analysis of Office Tower City of Tomorrow Surabaya by method of comparing market Data and cost approach method; Miftahul, M., Christiono, U., (2012) The analysis of Highest and Best Use (HBU) is for commercial Property","Tedja, M.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: michaelt@binus.ac.id",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Violence can occur anywhere and everywhere its disturb the public and make the others worry. Despite the big problem of violence against women, the lack of solution and protection make it worse. This research objective was to present a solution for a better protection. This research is conducted by using data collection method through literature study and interview, also Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD). This analysis based on increasing number violence each year especially against women. So, by analysis and designing this application can help victim of violence by conducting rescue, protection and consultation. © 2018 IEEE.","mobile application; OOAD; violence victims on women","Information management; Data collection method; Literature studies; Mobile applications; Object oriented analysis and design; OOAD; Prototype designs; Research objectives; violence victims on women; Object oriented programming",,,,,"Harnoko, B.R., Dibalik tindak kekerasan terhadap perempuan (2010) Muwazah, pp. 181-188; Catatan Kekerasan Terhadap Perempuan Tahun 2017, Hal, p. 108. , National Commission on Violence Against Women (2018, Maret 7).

As the companies grow fast, they need fast report to help the management create a decision for developing their product. They need this report to help them decide what the action they need to do based on the data they have for compete with fellow rival in online travel company. This data warehouse development has purpose to help provide a big picture of XYZ company's customers behavior through data in report generated. The data warehouse development uses some steps designed by Kimball. Information generated will be presented in dashboard or report. The data warehouse is expected to be able to provide quick and accurate information for management to choose best decision on next product development based on customer behavior. © 2018 IEEE.","data warehouse; flight; reservation; reservation system; travel","Data warehouses; Decision making; Reservation systems; Best decision; Customer behavior; Data warehouse development; flight; reservation; travel; Pattern recognition",,,,,,"Das, T.K., Mohapatro, A., A study on big data integration with data warehouse (2014) International Journal of Computer Trends and Technology, 9, pp. 188-192; Sundjaja, A.M., Implementation of business intelligence on banking, retail and educational industry (2013) Communication and Information Technology (COMMIT), 7 (2), pp. 65-70; Girsang, A.S., Purwanto, A., Controlling system for stock raw material for production planning and inventory control in a pharmacy company (2017) International Review of Mechanical Engineering (IREME), 11 (11), pp. 855-861; Martins, D., Ramos, C., Rodrigues, J., Cardoso, P., Lam, R., Serra, F., Challenges in building a big data warehouse applied to the hotel business intelligence (2015) 6th Int.

They become an asset for companies that contain important insights and support in decision-making processes. Big data is one of technologies that used by many organizations for managing store data and data analysis. Therefore, storage management is one of important processes in big data management to ensure that data are stored correctly, safely and easily to be accessed. Despite having many advantages, big data technology still has several issues on storage management, especially if we relate between big data and cloud computing, such as data security which is very important. In this paper, we reviewed the previous works for data security in storage management in big data technology and provide a suggestion to answer the challenge of data security. © 2018 IEEE.","big data; cloud computing management; security; storage","Cloud computing; Decision making; Digital storage; Energy storage; Information management; Storage management; Big data technologies; Decision making process; security; Semi-structured; Big data",,,,"Binus University","VI.

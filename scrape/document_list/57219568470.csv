With the goal to increase the user engagement, boost performance, and improve quality service for customer satisfaction, the gamification is enforced as a method to enhance the KMS design by identifying the game elements required. Furthermore, consulting activities are categorized based on the knowledge management processes in this research to be matched to the corresponding game components. The result of the obtained transformed and stored information will be applied to the system in forms of gamified features that is illustrated onto the user performance and activity dashboard. This paper aims to point out how the utilization of gamification for knowledge management can benefit consulting firm's daily operation by implementing the gamified KMS. © 2020 IEEE.","Consulting Companies; Gamification; Knowledge Management System","Customer satisfaction; Gamification; Information services; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Service industry; Consulting firms; Consulting services; Game elements; Knowledge management process; Knowledge management system; Quality services; User engagement; User performance; Knowledge management",,,,,"Asrar-Ul-Haq, M., Anwar, S., A systematic review of knowledge management and knowledge sharing: Trends, issues, and challenges (2016) Cogent Business & Management, 3; Gattnar, E., Schneider, J., Stroetmann, B., Ekinci, O., Knowledge management in consulting activities (2014) Proceedings of the International Conference on Knowledge Management and Information Sharing-Volume 1: KMIS, , Rome; Durinik, M., Gamification in knowledge management systems (2014) CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL of MANAGEMENT, pp. 41-50; Blaauw, F., Bazylevska, L., Aiello, M., Gamification in a consulting company (2014) Orkshop Autonomous Systems, 835; Ahmed, K.M., Effect of design elements for social media ads on consumer's purchasing decision (2020) Global Media Journal, pp. 18-34; Dulkasia, I., Bellini, F., Zabal, R., Panella, O.G., D'Ascenzo, F., Gamification as an instrument for organizational behaviour change during the meeting: Case study ""robatiempos"" (2017) Proceedings of the International Conference on Business Excellence; Felker, K., Phetteplace, E., Gamification in libraries: The state of the art (2014) Reference & User Services Quarterly, 54 (2), pp. 19-23; Abusweilem, M.A., Abualoush, S., The impact of knowledge management process and business intelligence on organizational performance (2019) Management Science Letters; Al-Qarioti, M.Q.A., The impact of knowledge management on organizational performance: An empirical study of Kuwait university (2015) Eurasian Journal of Business and Management, pp. 36-54; Jennex, M.E., (2020) Knowledge Management, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship in A Changing World, , San Diego: IGI Global; Alharithy, M., Knowledge management process in several organizations: Analytical study of modeling and several processes (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 65, pp. 726-733; Alsawaier, R., The effect of gamification on motivation and engagement (2017) International Journal of Information and Learning Technology, 35 (1), pp. 56-79; Figueroa-Flores, J.F., Gamification and game-based learning: Two strategies for the 21st century learner (2016) World Journal of Educational Research, 3 (2), pp. 2333-5998",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","5th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2020","13 August 2020 through 14 August 2020",,163671,,9781728170718,,,"English","Proc.

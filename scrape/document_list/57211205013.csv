To be able to survive in the fierce global competition, companies, especially companies engaged in the production sector, need to do a strategic production planning (SPP). This study aims to achieve optimal decisions in strategic production planning based on the product life cycle (PLC) using the decision support model (DSM). The DSM for suggesting the optimal model for SPP based on PLC is a proposed contribution to knowledge. In this study, several methods operated which are divided into 2 stages. The first step was to construct a similarity model. Here, Euclidean distance and fuzzy logic methods operated technically to determine the existence stage of a product in PLC. In the second stage, an optimization model was developed, where deep analysis and mathematical methods used for the selection of the right strategy and the hybrid L2HC method functioned to optimize the strategies chosen previously to produce optimal decisions in strategic production planning. © ICIC International 2020.","Decision support model; Fuzzy logic; Latin-hyper-cube-hill-climbing; Optimization; Product life cycle; Strategic production planning",,,,,"Binus University","We would like to thank BINUS University who has supported our works, particularly BINUS graduate program, Master of Computer Science.","Gianesi, I.

These two methods are going to be tested operating the same data-set in order to get the comparison result for both methods. The result shows that the hybrid model has a better performance than hill-climbing. Based on the number of global optimum value occurrence, the hybrid model outperformed 7.6% better than hill-climbing, and produced more stable average global optimum value. However, the model has a little longer running time due to a genuine characteristic of the model itself. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.","Hill-Climbing; Latin-Hyper-Cube; Optimization",,,,,,,"Norvig, P.R., Intelligence, S.A., (2002) A modern approach, , Prentice Hall; Metropolis, N., Rosenbluth, A.W., Rosenbluth, M.N., Teller, A.H., Teller, E., Equation of state calculations by fast computing machines (1953) J.

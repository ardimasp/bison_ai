More than 70% of the world's student population were affected by such a disruptive event, inclusive of undergraduate students in their final year preparing their research project. Senior students in Food Science generally perform laboratory-oriented research project, which can be problematic due to the closure of laboratories and universities. I wrote this article to give an insight into conducting final year research projects from home amidst the COVID-19 crisis based on my personal experience as a research supervisor. The research methods discussed include literature review, analysis of secondary data, survey research, simple food processing, remote sensory evaluation, and glycemic index analysis. Regardless of the type of research chosen, consistent guidance and support from a research supervisor toward the student, both academic and moral, appears to be a fundamental factor determining the success of the student in completing his/her final research project, particularly during these difficult times. © 2020 Institute of Food Technologists®","COVID-19; education; final project; remote learning; research",,,,,,"Atika, S., Sutrisno, B., (2020) COVID-19: Jakarta to tighten mobility restrictions, , https://www.thejakartapost.com, April 8., The Jakarta Post, Retrieved from; Boutrolle, I., Delarue, J., Arranz, D., Rogeaux, M., Köster, E.P., Central location test vs. home use test: Contrasting results depending on product type (2007) Food Quality and Preference, 18 (3), pp. 490-499; Burgess, S., Sievertsen, H.H., (2020) Schools, skills, and learning: The impact of COVID-19 on education, , https://voxeu.org/article/impact-covid-19-education, Retrieved from; Cresswell, J.W., (2014) Research design: Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches, , 4th ed., Thousand Oaks, CA, SAGE; Cronin, P., Ryan, F., Coughlan, M., Undertaking a literature review: A step-by-step approach (2008) British Journal of Nursing, 17 (1), pp. 38-43; Elfahmi, W.H., Kayser, O., Jamu: Indonesian traditional herbal medicine towards rational phytopharmacological use (2014) Journal of Herbal Medicine, 4 (2), pp. 51-73; Faisant, N., Buleon, A., Colonna, P., Molis, C., Lartigue, S., Galmiche, J.P., Champ, M., Digestion of raw banana starch in the small intestine of healthy humans: Structural features of resistant starch (1995) British Journal of Nutrition, 73 (1), pp. 111-123; Gewin, V., Five tips for moving teaching online as COVID-19 takes hold (2020) Nature, 580 (7802), pp. 295-296; Green, B.N., Johnson, C.D., Adams, A., Writing narrative literature reviews for peer-reviewed journals: Secrets of the trade (2006) Journal of Chiropractic Medicine, 5 (3), pp. 101-117; Jenkins, D.J., Wolever, T.M., Taylor, R.H., Barker, H., Fielden, H., Baldwin, J.M., Goff, D.V., Glycemic index of foods: A physiological basis for carbohydrate exchange (1981) The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 34 (3), pp. 362-366; Kasih, A.P., (2020) Classes to stay online in Indonesian schools until further notice, , https://go.kompas.com, June 16., Kompas, Retrieved from; Paré, G., Trudel, M.C., Jaana, M., Kitsiou, S., Synthesizing information systems knowledge: A typology of literature reviews (2015) Information & Management, 52 (2), pp. 183-199; Ponto, J., Understanding and evaluating survey research (2015) Journal of The Advanced Practitioner in Oncology, 6 (2), pp. 168-171; Puspita, C., Factors affecting students’ difficulties in writing thesis: A mixed-methods research at eighth semester of English study program in IAIN Curup (2019) ELLiC Proceedings, 3, pp. 13-22; Ramdhani, A., Ramdhani, M.A., Amin, A.S., Writing a literature review research paper: A step-by-step approach (2014) International Journal of Basic and Applied Science, 3 (1), pp. 47-56; Sahu, P., (2020) Closure of universities due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Impact on education and mental health of students and academic staff, , https://www.cureus.com/articles/30110-closure-of-universities-due-to-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-impact-on-education-and-mental-health-of-students-and-academic-staff, Retrieved from; Stone, H., Bleibaum, R., Thomas, H., (2012) Sensory evaluation practices, , 4th ed., San Diego, CA, Academic Press; Stone, H., Sidel, J., Oliver, S., Woolsey, A., Singleton, R.C., Sensory evaluation by quantitative descriptive analysis (2008) Descriptive Sensory Analysis in Practice, 28, pp. 23-34; (2020) COVID-19 educational disruption and response, , https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse, Retrieved from; Wolever, T.M., Jenkins, D.J., Jenkins, A.L., Josse, R.G., The glycemic index: Methodology and clinical implications (1991) The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 54 (5), pp. 846-854; Yamaguchi, T., Food marketing (2017) Food science and technology, pp. 473-486. , G.

It exhibits antioxidant activities mainly due to phytochemicals known as isoflavones. Since tempeh is mainly consumed cooked, this study investigated the influences of steaming process at three different times (10 min, 30 min and 60 min) on the antioxidant activities of tempeh. While a subtle decrease in antioxidant activities was observed in tempeh aqueous extracts, tempeh ethanol extracts did not differ in antioxidant activities. The results suggested that steaming process, even when applied for an hour, caused very minimal decrease in tempeh antioxidant activities. Such a decrease was particularly observed in the water-soluble fraction but not in the ethanol-soluble fraction. Therefore, steaming could be opted as a good cooking method for tempeh to keep its antioxidant-related health benefits. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","antioxidant; isoflavone; soybean;

It exerts antioxidant activities mainly due to the presence of bioactive compounds known as isoflavones. We previously observed that tempeh ethanol extract increased the basal expression of some cellular antioxidant enzymes including catalase and superoxide dismutases in HepG2 cells in vitro. In this study, we showed that pretreament with tempeh extract protected HepG2 cells from oxidative stress triggered by TBHP (tert-butyl hydroperoxide) by reducing cellular ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation, TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive species) levels, caspase-3 activity and eventually cell death. We hypothesize that the resistance of cells pretreated with tempeh extract towards the toxicity of TBHP was in part due to the upregulation of cellular antioxidant enzymes. Taken together, our findings highlight the antioxidative potentials of tempeh, particularly in an attempt to develop tempeh as a functional food offering health-related benefits to humans. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","antioxidant;

Experimental studies explain this positive association by the oxidative properties of heme iron released in the colon. This latter is a potent catalyst for lipid peroxidation, resulting in the neoformation of deleterious aldehydes in the fecal water of heme-fed rats. The toxicity of fecal water of heme-fed rats was associated to such lipid peroxidation. This study demonstrated that fecal water of hemoglobinand beef-fed rats preferentially induced apoptosis in mouse normal colon epithelial cells than in those carrying mutation on Apc (Adenomatous polyposis coli) gene, considered as preneoplastic. Highlighting the importance of lipid peroxidation and neoformation of secondary aldehydes like 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), we optimized the depletion of carbonyl compounds in the fecal water which turned out to abolish the differential apoptosis in both cell lines. To explain the resistance of preneoplastic cells towards fecal water toxicity, we focused on Nrf2, known to be activated by aldehydes, including HNE. Fecal water activated Nrf2 in both cell lines, associated with the induction of Nrf2-target genes related to aldehydes detoxification. However, the antioxidant defense appeared to be higher in preneoplastic cells, favoring their survival, as evidenced by Nrf2 inactivation. Taken together, our results suggest that Nrf2-dependent antioxidant response was involved in the resistance of preneoplastic cells upon exposure to fecal water of hemoglobin- and beef-fed rats. This difference could explain the promoting effect of red meat and heme-enriched diet on colorectal cancer, by initiating positive selection of preneoplastic cells. © The Author 2016.",,"aldehyde; carbonyl derivative; hemoglobin; transcription factor Nrf2; water; 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; antioxidant; hemoglobin; Nfe2l2 protein, rat; transcription factor Nrf2; adenomatous polyposis coli gene; animal cell; antioxidant activity; apoptosis; Article; beef; cancer cell; colon; controlled study; detoxification; epithelium cell; feces; gene; gene mutation; nonhuman; precancer; priority journal; protein expression; rat; red meat; water analysis; adverse effects; animal; Colorectal Neoplasms; drug inactivation; feces; Fischer 344 rat; genetics; male; metabolism; mouse; pathology; precancer; red meat; Aldehydes; Animals; Antioxidants; Apoptosis; Colon; Colorectal Neoplasms; Feces; Hemoglobins; Inactivation, Metabolic; Male; Mice; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Precancerous Conditions; Rats, Inbred F344; Red Meat",,"hemoglobin, 9008-02-0; water, 7732-18-5; 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; Aldehydes; Antioxidants; Hemoglobins; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Nfe2l2 protein, rat",,,"Cummings, J.H., Diet and the prevention of cancer (1998) BMJ, 317, pp. 1636-1640; Watson, A.J., Colon cancer: a civilization disorder (2011) Dig.

Heme iron, heterocyclic amines, and endogenous N-nitroso compounds (NOC) are proposed to explain this effect, but their relative contribution is unknown. Our study aimed at determining, at nutritional doses, which is the main factor involved and proposing a mechanism of cancer promotion by red meat. The relative part of heme iron (1% in diet), heterocyclic amines (PhIP + MeIQx, 50 + 25 mg/kg in diet), and NOC (induced by NaNO<inf>2</inf> + NaNO<inf>3</inf>; 0.17 + 0.23 g/L of drinking water) was determined by a factorial design and preneoplastic endpoints in chemically induced rats and validated on tumors in Min mice. The molecular mechanisms (genotoxicity, cytotoxicity) were analyzed in vitro in normal and Apc-deficient cell lines and confirmed on colon mucosa. Heme iron increased the number of preneoplastic lesions, but dietary heterocyclic amines and NOC had no effect on carcinogenesis in rats. Dietary hemoglobin increased tumor load in Min mice (control diet: 67 ± 39 mm2; 2.5% hemoglobin diet: 114±47mm2, P=0.004). In vitro, fecal water from rats given hemoglobin was rich in aldehydes and was cytotoxic to normal cells, but not to premalignant cells. The aldehydes 4-hydroxynonenal and 4-hydroxyhexenal were more toxic to normal versus mutated cells and were only genotoxic to normal cells. Genotoxicity was also observed in colon mucosa of mice given hemoglobin. These results highlight the role of heme iron in the promotion of colon cancer by red meat and suggest that heme iron could initiate carcinogenesis through lipid peroxidation. © 2015 American Association for Cancer Research.",,"heme; iron; adverse effects; animal; C57BL mouse; carcinogenesis; Colonic Neoplasms; Fischer 344 rat; male; meat; metabolism; mouse; rat; risk factor; tumor cell line; Animals; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line, Tumor; Colonic Neoplasms; Heme; Iron; Male; Meat; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Rats; Rats, Inbred F344; Risk Factors",,"heme, 14875-96-8; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; Heme; Iron",,,"DeSantis, C.E., Lin, C.C., Mariotto, A.B., Siegel, R.L., Stein, K.D., Kramer, J.L., Cancer treatment and survivorship statistics, 2014 (2014) CA Cancer J Clin, 64, pp. 252-271; WCRF, (2007) Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer: A Global Perspective, pp. 1-537. , Washington DC: WCRF and American Institute for Cancer Research; WCRF, (2010) WCRF/AICR Systematic Literature Review Continuous Update Project Report: The Associations Between Food, Nutrition and Physical Activity and the Risk of Colorectal Cancer, pp. 1-855. , Washington DC: WCRF and American Institute for Cancer Research; Pierre, F.H., Santarelli, R.L., Allam, O., Tache, S., Naud, N., Gueraud, F., Freezedried ham promotes azoxymethane-induced mucin-depleted foci and aberrant crypt foci in rat colon (2010) Nutr Cancer, 62, pp. 567-573; Pierre, F., Freeman, A., Tache, S., Van Der Meer, R., Corpet, D.E., Beef meat and blood sausage promote the formation of azoxymethane-induced mucin-depleted foci and aberrant crypt foci in rat colons (2004) J Nutr, 134, pp. 2711-2716; Corpet, D.E., Pierre, F., Point: From animal models to prevention of colon cancer.

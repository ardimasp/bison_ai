Therefore, thermal comfort problem would arise on a wide building with overcrowded people such as market building like Pasar Gedhe Hardjonegoro. The aim of this study is to examine the factors that influence the thermal comfort of a wide span building using passive cooling design. The tenants as the subject of this research are the main indicator in which the thermal comfort study of a building could be determined. The result of field studies indicates that there is a relation between the user's thermal comfort with the different location in the building. Study showed that thermal comfort is influenced by the function of circulation. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Passive cooling; Thermal comfort; Warm humid tropics","Thermal comfort; Tropics; Design strategies; Field studies; Humid tropics; Passive cooling; Tropical climates; Architectural design",,,,,"Antaryama, I., Ngurah, G., (2002) A Tropical House Is Not A Tree: A Topological Approach to Climate-Responsive Design; Givoni, B., (1994) Climate Considerations in Building and Urban Design; Givoni, B., (1994) Passive and Low Energy Cooling of Building; (2004) Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy (ASHRAE Standard 55-2004), , American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE); Ballantyne, E.R., Hill, R.K., Spencer, J.W., (1976) Probit Analysis of Thermal Sensation Assesments; Webb, C.G., On Some Observations of Indoor Climate in Malaya (1952) Journal of the Institution of Heating and Ventilating Engineers 1952, 20, pp. 189-195; Tri Harso, K., (2000) Teori Adaptasi Dan Keberlakuannya Bagi Penentuan Suhu Nyaman di Indonesia, Kalang, 2; Ma, H., Field Studies of Thermal Comfort and Applied (1975) Symposium on Physiological Requirements of the Microclimate","Soebiyan, V.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: Vivien.soe@binus.ac.id",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

One of the historical and cultural tourist destination which has great potential is Pasar Gedhe Hardjonegaro central market, which is a cultural heritage building. The development of the central market as a tourist destination is expected to improve this valuable place as one of the cultural and historical tourism destination. This paper aims to formulate the strategies to develop the Pasar Gedhe central market as the tourist destination towards sustainable tourism. For this purpose, a literature review was carried out to understand several terms and definitions, respect to sustainable tourism. This paper explores and discusses the aspects for developing a central market as a tourist destination and identifies the aspects for sustainable tourism by interpreting tourism in the context of sustainable development. The strategies are found by improving the local and cultural value, and the qualities and characteristics of place. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","central market; model development; sustainable tourism","Commerce; Sustainable development; Cultural heritages; Cultural value; Literature reviews; Model development; Sustainable tourism; Tourist destinations; Tourism",,,,,"Bapppeda.surakarta. go. id; Aliyah, I., Setioko, B., Pradoto, W., Spatial flexibility in cultural mapping of traditional market area in Surakarta: A case study of Pasar Gede in Surakarta (2017) City, Culture and Society, 10, pp. 41-51; Giantari, I., Surya, I., Yasa, N., Yasa, I., Development and revitalization strategies for traditional markets in Bali (2018) Intl.

Generally, based on the needs of healthy indoor environment and thermal comfort in the tropic, low cost housing in Jakarta uses single loaded corridor to draw air through two-way opposite openings for cross ventilation in promoting natural ventilation. In high rise apartment buildings, the use of double loaded corridor will be more efficient in space and construction costs but has limitations in providing ideal conditions for cross ventilation. This study focused on assessing the effect of the openings on double-loaded corridor, in high-rise low-income housing to promote better natural ventilation. This study aims to obtain the opening and corridor for natural ventilation in low income vertical housing. The research method is developed by the experimental research with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. The simulation uses Ecotec and Winair program to meet the wind profile inside the building. The variable data is observed from design typology, dimension of opening and corridor, and wind data. To refine the objective, this study focuses on high-rise low-income housing design typology (20 floors). © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

It means buildings have to reduce the energy consumption of fossil fuel and take action to use clean energy such as wind energy. The higher altitude, the higher wind speed. Wind speed as a function of altitude has a chance to be used in highrise buildings. Indonesia is a humid tropical country, which generally has the character of relatively low wind speeds. In another hand, high-rise buildings have considerable potential value to utilize height as a factor to obtain sufficient wind speed. This study aims to identify the potential for wind energy in high-rise buildings in humid tropical climate. Problems focused on the design arrangement of wind turbine type on the building and the potential energy can be harnessed. This research was conducted in suburban areas where the roughness level is lower than the city centre. This study focused on assessing the potential of the wind on tall buildings in a built environment in suburban areas. The research method is quantitative research which the variable is observed from wind speed data. Research developed by the experimental research method with CFD simulation to meet the built environment wind profile for further analysis. The variable data is observed from field measurement and local wind speed data. Case study takes on campus Bina Nusantara Alam Sutera as a case of the building which represents a type of highrise buildings in suburban Jakarta area. This study shows at least five types of possible arrangements which can be applied to buildings. This study presents the alternative use of wind energy utilization at Bina Nusantara University as a cross-subsidy scheme.

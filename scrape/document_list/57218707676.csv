Controlling the number of IT incident using ITIL framework is one of the success factor for organization in order to achieve its goals [18]. In the retail organization, the basic implementation of ITIL sometimes cannot fulfil the business requirement. It is requiring process improvement to get successful result to decrease or control number incidents. In this research, we have created new process that able to make synergy of Incident management and problem management process on ITIL version 4. The outcome of this research is to implement the new process to synergy the incident management and problem management in practices that will solve the IT support issues on retail organization. © 2005 JATIT and LLS.","Incidents Managements; ITIL; Problem Managements; Process; Retail; Synergy",,,,,,"This work is partially supported by PT XYZ management and its superior IT Support team.

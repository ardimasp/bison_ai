In Indonesia, the utilization of e-commerce has flourished because it has many benefits and advantages to broaden the market and stay competitive. However, it is faced with many challenges such as fraud, commission fees, limited contact between buyer and seller and misuse of personal data. Blockchain implementation has the potential to solve this problem with increased security and transparency through the implementation of cryptocurrency in payment and smart contracts. This paper explores the usage of the blockchain, cryptocurrency and smart contract to e-commerce for a secure and efficient transaction in Indonesia. The result will be used to propose blockchain technology as e-commerce platform architecture and systems in Indonesia. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Furthermore, share services and cloud computing solutions could helped modern higher education and universities to create low costs and efficient service management by collaboration and open environment. The creation off interconnected modern higher education ecosystem has become an important way for players in the field of education. This paper is to propose SOA adoption solutions for universities and education institutions by modelling and designing the interconnected modern higher education’s system. The aim is to create a new educational environment where learners have digital course and information accessible easily to support their educational and career goals. On the other hand, the solution is to understand the way universities and education institution solved demands complexity of the digital learning system by reducing investment costs. Moreover, we are purposing new alternatives of the architecture systems that focused on interoperability and cross-platform functionality in order to deal with high level components diversity. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","ELearning; Interconnected Modern Higher Education; Service Oriented Architecture SOA; Universities",,,,,,"Bak, H., Beyond the economy: Education for development (2018) Kasetsart J.

At present, the Indonesian tax directorate general has implemented an E-billing system that can be used by the public to make tax payments online. E-billing is available in the form of web-based and mobile applications in order to facilitate the public in making payments. However, in reality, there are still many people who prefer to use traditional methods of paying taxes. Initial allegations, these problems relate to web design factors, design applications, and website quality from the E-billing system. This paper examines the factors that relate to people's satisfaction with the decision to use the E-billing system. © 2018 IEEE.","application design; e-billing; satisfaction; service quality; web design","Citrus fruits; Quality of service; Web Design; Application design; Billing systems; Design applications; Digital technologies; Mobile applications; satisfaction; Service Quality; Website quality; Websites",,,,,"Carter, L., Belanger, F., Citizen adoption of electronic government initiatives (2004) System Sciences, 2004.

This study also gave new approach on sustainable solution that assess by economic advantage. In many industry solvents is used for cleaning the processing equipment's to avoid cross contamination from one batch to the other, due to the solvent scrap is being generated in the cleaning process. In often times, this scrap has been thrown away since it is already contaminated with the products, so it is being considered as scrap. In order to minimize the scrap, recovery of solvent is one method to recover the solvent. For the research, the distillation process was proposed, so the contaminated solvent can be purified so it can be use again for cleaning, or in some case it can be also use again as raw material for products. The solvent recovery is not only minimizing carbon foot print but also provides more sustainability. The solvent recovery gives also cost advantage for the industry. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","distillation; recovery system; solvent for cleaning; Waste solvent; waste treatment","Chemical cleaning; Chemical equipment; Contamination; Distillation; Economic analysis; Recovery; Waste treatment; Cleaning equipments; Cross contamination; Distillation process; Processing equipment; Recovery systems; Solvent recovery systems; Sustainable solution; Waste solvents; Solvents",,,,,,"Chaniago, Y.D., Quang Minh, L., Khan, M.S., Koo, K., Bahadori, A., Lee, M., Optimal design of advanced distillation configuration for enhanced energy efficiency of waste solvent recovery process in semiconductor industry (2015) Energy Conversion and Management, 102, pp. 92-103; Mendez-Alvarez, C., Plesu, V., Ruiz, A.E.B., Ruiz, J.B., Iancu, P., Llorens, J., Distillation Energy Assessment for Solvent Recovery from Carbon Dioxide Absorption (2016) Computer Aided Chemical Engineering, 38, pp. 1917-1922; Ahmad, B.S., Barton, P.I., Synthesis of batch processes with integrated solventrecovery and recycling (1994) AIChE Symp.

As for the method is used for this research is using six sigma approach with DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) phases to analyze types of waste of staple fiber production and factors that causes the waste. Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) Method to analyze the effect of machine productivity and performance on waste of staple fiber production using calculation of Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and six big losses are using to analyze the losses that caused value of OEE. Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) is used to analyze the risks that probably occurs during spinning process on production line 28P which causes the high total time losses on idling and minor stoppages. One of the risk that has the highest probability is the amount of output caused by abnormality of gear pump machine. Based on the calculation of Time to Failure (TTF) and Time to Repair (TTR), the interval of gear pump machine replacement using age replacement model is 1300 hours and the interval of gear pump machine maintenance is 823,9277 hours as of the reliability of machine has increase after. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt.

There is a primary difference between the location characteristic of the university campus and urban campus. The university campus usually locates in the suburbs with public facilities integrated into the campus. Meanwhile, urban campus is in the city or urban area where the public life of the academic community will dispense in public facilities scattered around the campus. Understanding the spatial characteristics of existing urban campuses are expected to provide insight about essential points to consider in determining the appropriate location. This study aims to explore the spatial characteristics of an urban campus in Indonesia with other public facilities. The result of this study is information about the neighborhood relationship between urban campus with other public facilities. The Geographic Information System Approach is implemented to store, manage, and visualize spatial data collected, using QGIS Desktop software. PostgreSQL and PostGIS are used for spatial data analysis to get neighborhoods characteristic around the campus. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

This paper reveals findings from observations towards the digital media users in four countries in Southeast Asia using 5 key indicators; namely self-expression, learning needs, leisure & entertainment, escape from real life and killing time, with an analysis from the demographic perspective of the respondents including gender, education, country and age. The results of the survey show that gratifications obtained in the digital media in these countries were not correlated with gender and education, but it was different or correlated with country and age of the respondents. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Digital media; Obtained gratification; Southeast Asia; Uses and gratifications theory",,,,,,"(2019) Southeast Asia Digital, Social and Mobile 2019, , https://aseanup.com/southeast-asia-digital-social-mobile/; Baran, S.J., Davis, D.K., (2009) Mass Communication Theory: Foundations, Ferment, and Future (6th Ed.), , Boston, MA: Wadsworth; Cook, S., (2019) Youtube Statistics and Facts, , https://www.comparitech.com/tv-streaming/youtube-statistics/, July 8; Kang, M.E., Atkin, D.J., Exploring the role of media uses and gratifications in multimedia cable adoption (1999) Telematics and Informatics, 16 (1-2), pp. 59-74; Katz, E., Blumber, J.G., Gurevitch, M., Uses and gratifications research (1974) The Public Opinion Quarterly, 37 (4), pp. 509-523; Lin, J., The effects of gratifications on intention to read citizen journalism news: The mediating effect of attitude (2014) Computers in Human Behavior, 36, pp. 129-137; Luo, X., Uses and gratifications theory and e-consumer behaviors: A structural equation modeling study (2002) Journal of Interactive Advertising, 2 (2), pp. 34-41; Magsamen-Conrad, K., Greene, K., Technology addiction's contribution to mental wellbeing: The positive effect of online social capital (2014) Computers in Human Behavior, 40, pp. 23-30; Malik, A., Dhir, A., Nieminen, M., Uses and gratifications of digital photo sharing on facebook (2016) Telematics and Informatics, 33 (1), pp. 129-138; McQuail, D., (2010) Mass Communication Theory: An Introduction, , London: Sage Publications; (2019) Southeast Asia Mobile Internet Usage Increasing Dramatically, , https://medium.com/fi-nancex/southeast-asia-mobile-internet-usage-increasing-dramatically-bb63266affb5; Mowen, J., Minor, M., (2002) Consumer Behavior, , (5th ed.).

It has transformed itself into not just a platform for social interactions, but into a powerful marketing tool. People posting pictures or information through social media will likely influence others seeing it. This research investigates the impact of social media postings on millennial (Gen Y) tourists’ decision in choosing destinations, as well as the perceptions of social media users toward the information they gather from the social media about the tourism destinations. World Travel and Tourism Council in its release in 2018 revealed that tourism industry represents 10.4% of total global GDP. The industry has also contributed 20% of new jobs globally created in the last decade. The findings from samples taken from respondents in greater Jakarta (Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang and Bekasi) show that social media contributes significantly on shaping the millennial tourists’ decision in choosing their holiday destinations. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Decision on destination; Impact; Perception; Social media; Tourists’ destination",,,,,,"Bialik, K., Matsa, K.E., (2017) Key Trends in Social and Digital News Media, p. 4. , Pew Research Center; Dudensing, R.M., Hughes, D.W., Shields, M., Perceptions of tourism promotion and business challenges: A survey-based comparison of tourism businesses and promotion organizations (2011) Tourism Management, 32 (6), pp. 1453-1462; Felix, R., Rauschnabel, P.A., Hinsch, C., Elements of strategic social media marketing: A holistic framework (2017) Journal of Business Research, 70, pp. 118-126; Kovathanakul, D., Central Northeastern Thailand Tourism Branding, Supporting the ASEAN Economic Community (2015) Procedia Economics and Finance, 23, pp. 291-297; Lin, J., The effects of gratifications on intention to read citizen journalism news: The mediating effect of attitude (2014) Computers in Human Behavior, 36, pp. 129-137; Malik, A., Dhir, A., Nieminen, M., Uses and gratifications of digital photo sharing on Face-book (2016) Telematics and Informatics, 33 (1), pp. 129-138; Nunnally, J., Bernstein, I., (1994) Psychometric Theory 3Rd Edition, , (MacGraw-Hill, New York; Punyanunt-Carter, N.M., de La Cruz, J.J., Wrench, J.S., Investigating the relationships among college students' satisfaction, addiction, needs, communication apprehension, motives, and uses & gratifications with Snapchat (2017) Computers in Human Behavior, 75, pp. 870-875; Rodríguez-Molina, M.A., Frías-Jamilena, D.M., Castañeda-García, J.A., The contribution of website design to the generation of tourist destination image: The moderating effect of involvement (2015) Tourism Management, 47, pp. 303-317; Sánchez, M., Campo, S., Alvarez, M.D., The effect of animosity on the intention to visit tourist destinations (2018) Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, 7, pp. 182-189; Gao, J., Wang, G., Wu, J., Arsenic trioxide inhibits Skp2 expression to increase chemosensitivity to gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells (2019) Am J Transl Res, 11, pp. 991-997; Souiden, N., Ladhari, R., Chiadmi, N.E., Destination personality and destination image (2017) Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, 32, pp. 54-70; Strauss, W., Howe, N., (2000) Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation, p. 29. , New York: Vintage Books; Thai, N.T., Yuksel, U., Too many destinations to visit: Tourists’ dilemma?

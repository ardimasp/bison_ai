The growth of SMEs has made little contribution to Indonesia export value while their business orientation is ready to export in real data. The purpose of this study is to analyse the mediating effect of the Internationalisation process on knowledge management and export towards SMEs Export Performance. The research strategies used include the associative quantitative method where the data collection method consists of a survey distributed to 154 Export-Oriented SMEs respondents while data analysis technique incorporates path analysis using double regression method. The results show that the internationalisation process has a mediating effect on knowledge management and the dynamic capabilities that affect SMEs export performance. Knowledge management and dynamic capabilities have a direct impact on SMEs export performance. The value of mediating effect is lower than its direct effect, showing that the internationalisation process enhances the effect of knowledge management and dynamic capabilities towards SMEs export performance. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Dynamic capabilities; Export performance; Internationalisation process; Knowledge management; Mediating effect",,,,,,"Management influences on export performance: A review of the empirical literature 1978-1988 (1989) International Marketing Review, 6 (4), pp. 7-26; Strategi produk untuk mengatasi hambatan ekspor UKM industry kerajinan Indonesia (2015) Jurnal Manajemen & Bisnis Sriwijaya, 13 (1), pp. 39-53; Knowledge management and the innovation performance in a high-tech SMEs industry (2011) International Small Business Journal, pp. 1-18; Internationalization of small-and medium-sized enterprises: A multi case study (2010) European Business Review, 22 (6), pp. 608-623; International new ventures: Rapid internationalization across different industry contexts' (2014) European Business Review, 26 (5), pp. 390-405. , https://doi.org/10.1108/EBR-05-2014-0040; Determinants and measures of export performance-comprehensive literature review (2014) Journal of Contemporary Economic and Business Issues, 1 (1), pp. 63-74; Export market-oriented behaviour and export performance: Quadratic and moderating effects under differing degrees of market dynamism and internationalization (2009) Journal of International Marketing, 17 (4), pp. 71-89; 29 Tantangan Internasionalisasi Ukm Di Indonesia Dalam Menghadapi Masyarakat Ekonomi (2015) Journal Kajian, 27 (9), pp. 129-144; Marketing strategy-performance relationship: An investigation of the empirical link in export market ventures (1994) Journal of Marketing, 58, pp. 1-21; The Determinants of Export Performance: A Review of the Literature 2006-2014 (2016) International Marketing Review, 33 (5), pp. 626-670; Information, knowledge and collaboration management in the internationalisation of SMEs: A systematic literature review (2016) International Journal of Information Management, 36 (4), pp. 557-569; The emergence, advance and future of international entrepreneurship research: An introduction to the special forum (2011) Journal of Business Venturing, 26 (6), pp. 625-631; Institutional theory and institutional change: Introduction to the special research forum (2002) The Academy of Management Journal, 45 (1), pp. 43-56; Viewpoint-Export Performance Measurement: Reflective Versus Formative I˙ndicators (1999) International Marketing Review, 16 (6), pp. 444-457; Knowledge management in SMEs: A literature review (2012) Journal of Knowledge Management, 16 (6), pp. 879-903; Dynamic capabilities and Knowledge Management: An integrative role for learning?

The high-level house of quality matrix was modified and used as a tool to evaluate the ongoing KMS implementation. Additionally, the Infosys KM Maturity Model was applied to determine its maturity level. Targeted result for this study is to form a recommendation for KMS implementation in the organization, especially in the private banking industry. KMS spread to various business field. It becomes an obligation for every organization to manage its knowledge flow and drive it to achieve innovation. As an industry with huge amount of knowledge come in and out daily, banking industry need to take their KMS to another level. By evaluating its KMS periodically, organization may improve the performance, quality and maturity level of its KMS. © 2019 IEEE.","HoQ; house of quality; KMS; knowledge management system; private banking industry","Houses; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Banking industry; Evaluation of knowledge; House of Quality; Indonesia; Knowledge flow; Knowledge management system; Maturity levels; Maturity model; Quality control",,,,,"Tanaji, B.S., (2012) Benefits of Knowledge Management System for Banking Sector, 3 (1), pp. 133-137; Chawla, D., Joshi, H., (2010) Knowledge Management Initiatives in Indian Public and Private Sector Organizations, 14 (6), pp. 811-827; Cham, T.H.T.H., Lim, Y.M., Cheng, B.L., Lee, Determinants of knowledge management systems success in the banking industry (2016) VINE J.

They provide warning signs and also give feedback to help the government take required measures to improve its performance. In the public sector, it is difficult to measure the output as services provided do not have a price which would indicate their value to the community. Outputs, such as education services, are provided free or at a subsidized price. One of the public sectors in Indonesia which is very important to be measured for its productivity is public schooling. This study is one of the first efforts in looking at the feasibility of constructing productivity measures for Indonesian public schools. The method and model used in measuring Public School productivity is modified. Data used are secondary data available from several government sources. The study has been positive and has produced some interesting and meaningful results. Public school productivity in Indonesia has improved overall since 2011 and the improvement is getting better still, since 2014. But these improvements are not enough and are still lagging behind several ASEAN countries. The policies and programs need to be analyzed and evaluated in such a way that there is improvement in the overall education productivity and education quality. It is important that measures will be improved by involving stakeholders in the productivity measurement study. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Goods and services; Government policies; Inputs; Productivity measures outputs; Public sector outputs; Resources",,,,,,"Andrews, D., Criscuolo, C., Gal, P.N., (2016) The Best Versus the Rest: The Global Productivity Slowdown, Divergence across Firms and the Role of Public Policy (OECD Productivity Working Papers, 2016-05), , Paris, France: OECD Publishing; Atkinson, A.B., The Atkinson review: Final report (2005) Measurement of Government Output and Productivity for the National Accounts, , Basingstoke, England: Palgrave Macmillan; (2017) Report on Government Services 2017, , https://bsllibrary.org.au/general/report-government-services-rogs-2017-productivity-commission-79753/, Canberra, Australia: AGPC.

The results of statistical data analysis reveals that learning culture has an indirect effect on work engagement but a direct impact on learning agility. Learning agility also has a positive and significant effect on work engagement. Learning agility plays a mediating role in the relationship between work engagement and learning culture.

For this reason the method used is a quantitative research method which is carried out by distributing questionnaires to the respondents and then completing it by using path analysis. The results showed that Pancasila Education, especially the First Principle has no significant influence. It can be seen on the amounted 34,30%, while the effect of Religion Education on the Faithfulness Formation of the students is significant, which amounted to 59.4%. It can be concluded that Pancasila Education has smaller significant effect on the Faithfulness Formation of the students than Religion Education, which has significant effect. From the results of this study it became clear about the study of what types of education had a significant influence on the formation of the Faitfulness of the students. And the implication is that Religion Education should be delivered more intensively and seriously if we idealized to format faitfulness of our students as the young generation. Therefore, the students as the young generation not only having religion, but they have to be religious and faithful persons. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The concern of this research is based on student factors, especially the motivation of students to learn. There are many factors to motivate students to learn and one of them is learning interest. This research proposes to describe the contribution of learning interests against the learning motivation. To describe this contribution, this research chooses Character Building Course at Binus University as a study case. All students at Binus University have to take Character Building class. This research described how student’s interest correlated with the motivation of the students in learning Character Building. Based on the quantitative method, this research concluded that there is a correlation between a student’s interest and the student’s motivation in learning Character Building Course. The contribution of the student’s interest against the student’s motivation in learning Character Building is 9.7%. Because of the correlation is very weak, this research recommended to undergo advancing research that based on multiple variable both internal and external motivation, either on student’s level, lecturer, learning facility, teaching learning activities or learning system as whole. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.","Learning interest; Learning motivation",,,,,"Binus University",,"Hurst, J., Carbone, A., Mitchell, I., Gunstone, A.M., (2009) An Exploration of Internal Factors Influencing Student Learning of Programming, , http://crpit.com/confpapers/CRPITV95Carbone.pdf; Ormrod, J.E., (2011) Educational Psychology, Developing Learners, , 7th edn., Pearson, Boston; Santrock, J., (2008) Educational Psychology, , 3rd edn., The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc., New York; Schiefele, U., (1991) Educational Psychologist, 26, p. 299; Krapp, A., (1999) European Journal of Psychology of Education 1999, 14, p. 23; Djamrah, S.B., (2008) Psikologi Belajar, , Edisi 2, Rineka Cipta, Jakarta; Syah, M., (2006) Psikologi Belajar, , Raja Grafindo Persada, Jakarta","Ruman, Y.S.; Character Building Development Center, Jl.

However, it could be risen by trending technology utilization, namely Financial Technology (Fintech), in which mobile payment (m-payment) is one of the instruments. Therefore, the objective of our research is to examine financial literacy and mobile payment usage as financial inclusion determinants. The model of this research involved three indicators of financial literacy and two variables of TAM to indicate m-payment usage as technology adoption. We used primary data by spreading the questionnaire to 100 respondents, in which using the Slovin formula to decide this research sample. Multiple linear regression is employed for data analysis using SPSS 23. The results proved that financial knowledge, financial behavior, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use of mobile payments have a positive impact and statistically significant to financial inclusion. Meanwhile, a negative impact and statistically insignificant financial attitudes to financial inclusion are proved as well. Overall, better financial literacy and high usage of mobile payment may increase financial inclusion, especially in the Jabodetabek area. Our research paper contributes valuable insights to the Indonesian government, financial technology association, and the users. © 2020 IEEE.","Financial inclusion; Financial literacy; Financial technology; Mobile payment usage; Multiple linear regression","Electronic money; Fintech; Global system for mobile communications; Information management; Linear regression; Financial inclusions; Financial literacy; Multiple linear regressions; Perceived ease of use; Perceived usefulness; Research papers; Technology adoption; Technology utilization; Engineering education",,,,,,"(2017) Strategi Nasional Literasi Keuangan Indonesia (Revisit 2017); (2019) E-Conomy SEA 2019-Swipe up to the Right: Southeast Asia's $100 Billion Internet Economy, , Google, TEMASEK, and B. & COMPANY; Untoro, R., Trenggana, A., Dewi, K., (2013) Pemetaan Produk Dan Risiko Pembayaran Bergerak (Mobile Payment) Dalam Sistem Pembayaran di Indonesia; Annur, C.M., (2019) Darmin Sebut Fintech Ampuh Dorong Inklusi Keuangan Dibandingkan Bank, , https://katadata.co.id/berita/2019/09/04/darmin-sebutfintech-ampuh-dorong-inklusi-keuangan-dibandingkan-bank, katadata. co. id.

Furthermore, economic studies on cryptocurrency are limited. This research presents a pioneering study investigating cryptocurrencies contagion in the Asian financial markets. We use three methods of measuring contagions. The first method adjusts the bias in the correlation coefficient. The second method identifies exceedances (extreme return) and performs a multinomial logistic regression to explain the coexceedances. Finally, we also use a vector autoregression (VAR) system. We documented evidence that the (unadjusted) correlation coefficients between five cryptocurrencies and thirteen Asian financial markets tended to be low in both high and low variance periods. After adjusting the bias in the correlation coefficient, we found that there was no longer evidence of a significant change in the magnitude of the propagation mechanism from five cryptocurrencies to Asian foreign exchange and stock markets. Using a multinomial logit analysis, we also acknowledged that cryptocurrencies tended to be statistically insignificant determinants for both positive and negative coexceedances. Our third contagion analysis using a VAR system further revealed that cryptocurrencies tended to be statistically insignificant determinants explaining the current Asian financial market change variables. Our results suggest that cryptocurrencies do not possess a systemic risk to the Asian financial markets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Contagion; Cryptocurrencies; Multinomial logit; Systemic risk; Vector autoregression",,,,,,"We would like to thank seminar participants at the 2nd International Conference on Knowledge Management Systems (ICKMS2019) at University of Houston, Texas, participants at the Bina Nusantara (BINUS) University accounting and finance workshop, and two anonymous reviewers who provide valuable comments and suggestions to improve the quality of the manuscript.","Aizenman, J., Jinjarak, Y., Lee, M., Park, D., Developing countries’ financial vulnerability to the Eurozone crisis: an event study of equity and bond markets (2016) J.

However, how long the m-payment provider will survive to subsidize its promotional costs. Therefore, this study examines factors that affect the use of m-payment without looking at economic benefits but focus on customer behavior. The model in this study involved two individual differences and four m-payment features and equipped with two TAM variables that explain the behavior in adopting the technology. Then, empirical examination is conducted, starts with data collection using a survey from m-payment users. Afterwards, data is analyzed utilizing structural equation models (SEM) method. The result indicates that perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived of usefulness (PU) are the most powerful factors that influence the intention to use m-payment. Interestingly, among m-payment characteristics, only compatibility and convenience affect the PEOU while mobility and reachability have no effect on either PEOU or PU. This result also can be an insight for m-payment providers to implement their application development strategies based on their customer behavior. © 2019 IEEE.","individual differences; m-payment; m-payment characteristics; structural equation models","Economic and social effects; Information management; Application development; Economic benefits; Empirical examination; Individual Differences; M payments; Payment instrument; Perceived ease of use; Structural equation models; Electronic money",,,,,,"Au, Y.A., Kauffman, R.J., The economics of mobile payments: Understanding stakeholder issues for an emerging financial technology application (2008) Electron.

First stage employed is Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to estimate cost efficiency, revenue efficiency and profit efficiency.Second stage employed is Dynamic panel data using Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)to determine banks' efficiency determinants. The findings suggest that revenue inefficiency found to be the biggest contributor of profit inefficiency averagely. The higher Financing intensity, capitalization and inflation are, the higher cost, revenueand profit efficiency. However, most of variables are found to be insignificant on revenue efficiency model.","Asian Islamic banks; Bank efficiency; DEA; GMM",,,,,,,"Al-Gasaymeh, A., Bank efficiency determinant: Evidence from the gulf cooperation council countries (2016) Research in International Business and Finance, 38, pp. 214-223;

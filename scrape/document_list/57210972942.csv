In Indonesia, the utilization of e-commerce has flourished because it has many benefits and advantages to broaden the market and stay competitive. However, it is faced with many challenges such as fraud, commission fees, limited contact between buyer and seller and misuse of personal data. Blockchain implementation has the potential to solve this problem with increased security and transparency through the implementation of cryptocurrency in payment and smart contracts. This paper explores the usage of the blockchain, cryptocurrency and smart contract to e-commerce for a secure and efficient transaction in Indonesia. The result will be used to propose blockchain technology as e-commerce platform architecture and systems in Indonesia. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

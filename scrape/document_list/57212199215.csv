Tested on the Stanford Mobile Visual Dataset (SMVS), the BIS achieves better performance than WLIS on most categories, except for the 'video frames' category. In this paper we propose several modifications to BIS which resulted in a better overall performance compared to the WLIS and the basic BIS approaches. On average, the proposed Best Score Increasing Subsequence (BSIS) performs 4.53% better than the BIS and 9.43% better than the WLIS. © 2019 IEEE.","Best increasing subsequence; Geometric verification; Instance recognition; Object recognition; Smvs dataset","Computer science; Computers; Electrical engineering; Mathematical techniques; Best increasing subsequence; Geometric verifications; Instance recognition; Local feature; Longest increasing subsequences; Smvs dataset; Stanford; Video frame; Object recognition",,,,"23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia, through research grant number 23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019.","Ullman, S., (1996) High-level Vision Object Recognition Visual Cognition, , Cambridge Massachusetts, The, mit Press; Lowe, D., Object Recognition from Local Scale-Invariant Features (1999) Computer Vision 1999.

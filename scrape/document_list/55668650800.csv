When predictor variables also affect positive outcome, then gamma regression plays a role. In many cases, the predictor variables give effect to several responses simultaneously. In this article, we develop a multivariate gamma regression (MGR), which is one type of non-linear regression with response variables that follow a multivariate gamma (MG) distribution. This work also provides the parameter estimation procedure, test statistics, and hypothesis testing for the significance of the parameter, partially and simultaneously. The parameter estimators are obtained using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) that is optimized by numerical iteration using the Berndt-Hall-Hall-Hausman (BHHH) algorithm. The simultaneous test for the model's significance is derived using the maximum likelihood ratio test (MLRT), whereas the partial test uses the Wald test. The proposed MGR model is applied to model the three dimensions of the human development index (HDI) with five predictor variables. The unit of observation is regency/municipality in Java, Indonesia, in 2018. The empirical results show that modeling using multiple predictors makes more sense compared to the model when it only employs a single predictor. © 2020 by the authors.","Human development dimensions; Maximum likelihood estimation; Maximum likelihood ratio test; Multivariate gamma regression;Wald test",,,,,"Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, ITS: 1153/PKS/ITS/2019

The regression model has been developed in various ways, one of them is based on the distribution of the response variables. In this study, the response variables follow trivariate gamma distribution, such that the regression model developed is Trivariate Gamma Regression (TGR). The purposes of this study are to obtain the parameter estimators, test statistics, and hypothesis testing on parameters are significance (overall and partial) of the TGR model. The parameter estimators are obtained using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The overall test for the model's significance is using Maximum Likelihood Ratio Test (MLRT), and the partial test is using the Z test. Based on the results of this study, it can be inferred that the parameter estimators obtained from the MLE are not closed form. Hence a numerical method is needed.

GCM data is generally ill-conditioned, which is high dimension and multicollinearity, so a special technique is needed to handle this poorly conditioned. One of the variable selection techniques and handling of multicollinearity which is currently highly developed is regularization techniques including Adaptive Lasso, where selective parameters are adaptive, which can differ for each regression coefficient. Until now, predictions of extreme rainfall in Indonesia have not used Adaptive Lasso in SD modeling. This paper aims to predict the amount of rainfall (in millimeters) at moderate extreme (quantile 0.75) and high extreme rainfall (quantile 0.9 da 0.95) and handling poorly conditioned GCM data with Adaptive Lasso techniques and building predictive models of local rainfall by utilizing GCM data using the Bayes quantile regression model. Response in the form of monthly rainfall at Indramayu district, West Java Indonesia, and 49 explanatory variables in the form of GCM precipitation data in the period January 1981 - December 2013, which handled multicollinearity and variable selection using the Adaptive Lasso.

Syahdan No. 9 Kemanggisan, Palmerah, Jakarta Barat, 11480, Indonesia","The relationship between dependent variable and independent variables can be described using linear regression model. The model equation is called global model. But if the data is a spatial data, where the differences of locations affect the model, then global model is no longer relevant. One of method can be used to analysis for spatial data is Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). GWR is local model that represents model for each location. DKI Jakarta is a province with the highest human development index value in Indonesia. The HDI value is calculated based on some basic components of quality of life. In this paper, we analyze the HDI using multiple linear regression and we get a global model. But because DKI Jakarta consists of some regions with different condition, then we also used spatial data analysis methods. Then we apply GWR method to analyze the HDI in Jakarta. On the GWR model acquired local models for each location. We compared two models of global and local, the results showed that the factors that affect HDI in every region at DKI Jakarta are different. Based on the analysis by linear regression and GWR, the results show that the SSE of GWR model is smaller than linear regression model. So the GWR model is better than linear regression model. © 2016 Author(s).",,,,,,,,"(2012) Ind. Pem. Man.

In this system the main controller is a single-board computer Raspberry Pi which is powered by a Broadcom BCM2835 system on a chip (SoC). This device is powered by 5 v micro USB and will be running Raspbian as its main operating system alongside with Python as the main programming language used in this system.

Many of the problems that require knowledge about the behavior of extreme values and one of the methods used are the Extreme Value Theory (EVT). EVT used to draw up reliable systems in a variety of conditions, so as to minimize the risk of a major disaster. There are two methods for identifying extreme value, Block Maxima with Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution approach and Peaks over Threshold (POT) with Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) approach. This research in Indramayu with January 1961-December 2003 period, the method used is Block Maxima with GEV distribution approach. The result showed that there is no climate change in Indramayu with January 1961-December 2003 period. © IOP Publishing Ltd 2013.",,"Pareto principle; Wind effects; Extreme value theory; Extreme weather; Generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions; Generalized Pareto distribution; GEV distributions; Major disasters; Peaks over threshold; Reliable systems; Climate change",,,,,,"Diebold, F.X., Schuermann, T., Stroughair, J.D., (1998) J.Risk Finance, 1 (2), pp. 30-36. , 10.1108/eb043443 1526-5943; Gilli, Kellezi, (2003) An Application of Extreme Value Theory for Measuring Risk; Hastaryta, R., Effendie, A.R., (2006) Estimasivalue-at-risk Denganpendekatanextreme Value Theory-generalized Paretodistribution; Gander, J.P., (2009) J.Economics, 3, pp. 1-41; Georgescu, V., (2009) Measuring Risk with Extreme Value Theory; Gourier, E., Farkas, W., Abbate, D., (2009) J.Operational Risk 4, 3, pp. 3-26; Alves, M.L.F., Gomes, M.L., Statistical choice of extreme value domains of attraction-a comparative analysis (1996) Commun.

However, sometimes there are situations where no one can accompany, especially if they are going out so that the person is out of control. Time limitations are often seen as the main cause of the absence of people accompanying them, so the availability of a system that can detect human activities or falls automatically becomes very important. Pervasive computing implemented by using smartphone can improve the quality of service by monitoring the user. Pervasive health monitory system provides activity detection and activity monitoring features to help user to see their activity profile, give suggestion to user, and notify the family or caretaker if the user fallen or show unusual activity. This proposed solution has a great impact for elderly to avoid more deadly risks rather than not using this solution because no one knows about the incident. © 2020 IEEE.","Activity detection; Fall; Health monitoring system; Pervasive; Smartphone","Information management; Ubiquitous computing; Activity detection; Activity monitoring; Activity profile; Aging population; Human activities; Out-of-control; Pervasive health monitoring systems; Pervasive healths; Quality of service",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

Non-invasive, inexpensive, and easy-to-use healthcare approaches becomes quite critical to support continuous health monitoring and the needs of healthcare. Smartphone is one of the devices that have limited specification. But smartphone is powerful enough to become human fall detection because it already been included with sensors and elderly has accepted and used it (especially in the future). Threshold-based low power consumption human fall detection by using accelerometer-based with four critical characteristics, Alpha Degree, and AGPeak can be the answer to solves the problem specially to achieve low power consumption computation. By using this thresholding-based fall detection method, it can be implemented in smartphone (low power device) and give fast classification result, under 0.001 second/data - below the realtime response tolerance. © 2020 IEEE.","Classification; Fall detection; Low power; Monitoring system; Smartphone; Threshold-based","Electric power utilization; Information management; Smartphones; Fall detection; Fast classification; Health monitoring; Human fall detection; Low-power consumption; Low-power devices; Monitoring system; Real-time response; mHealth",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

Fall detection method is needed to minimized the problem when human fallen and smartphone can be used as the device to detect it. Usually people carry smartphone in any positions and can make fall detection method difficult to detect when fall occurs. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) combined with Sigmoid helps to answer the challenge to handle smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope data in many smartphone orientation position. LSTM method on this experiment can achieved 91.67% for the accuracy result. Since the fall data occurs rarely and there may be insufficient data available, the gamification prospect implemented in fall detection application especially on 'Bug' bounty can help researcher to enhance the accuracy result to make a better human fall detection method. © 2019 IEEE.","accelerometer;

The data for this study were collected by recording many sample units from each of the following human activity categories: stand-fall, walk-fall, stand-jump, stand-sit, stand, and walk. Several time-series data captured by the sensors were used as human motion features. One of the challenges of this study was the existence of human body motions whose features resembled those of body falls. In addition, unfixed smartphone positioning made human body falls harder to detect and can lead to high rate of misclassification (not detected as fall). This incident can caused serious bone fracture or even death if the person not handled as immediately as possible because of misclassification. To address this problem, we modified Resultant Acceleration and ∠ Y formulas to address the problem of unconstrained smartphone positions. We proposed to combine five methods such as AGVeSR, Alim, ∠α, GyroReDi, and AGPeak to build a robust detector model to reduce the misclassification. The experiment results showed that the accuracy of the combination of both sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) outperformed the accuracy of accelerometer only by more than 15%. The decision fusion that used voting involving five methods could boost the accuracy rate by up to 4.15%. © BEIESP.","Accelerometer; Gyroscope; Human fall detection; Unconstrained smartphone positions",,,,,,,"de la Concepción, M.Á.Á., Morillo, L.M.S., García, J.A.Á., González-Abril, L., Mobile activity recognition and fall detection system for elderly people using ameva algorithm (2017) Pervasive and Mobile Computing, 34, pp. 3-13;

However, very few remain to study the design process or the game model of Game-Based Learning. This paper explains how the framework is implemented to a game best suited for Game-Based Learning in Security Studies classroom. The aim of this study is to define and develop a game best suited for enhancing learning outcomes of National Defense Strategy subject in International Relations Department. The research implements MDA Framework in the development process of the game. The implementation process is done using IT-BluTric framework. IT-BluTric framework lists all processes that needed to be done. After several processes are done, feedbacks from field expert are collected. The questions for the feedbacks are linked to the 4 Key Characteristics of a Learning Game (challenge, curiosity, fantasy, control), which has a deep correlation with MDA Framework. The final result is an assessment of using IT-BluTric framework in developing a Game-Based Learning, along with feedbacks for the game. The conclusions are hoped to give insights on how MDA Framework is implemented in a Game-Based Learning and the whole development process could serve as a reference to other Game-Based Learning applications. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Game engineering; Game-based learning; IT-BluTric framework; MDA framework; Video game",,,,,,,"van Eck, R., (2006) Digital Game-Based Learning: It’s Not Just the Digital Natives Who are Restless, , Educause Review, March/April; Prensky, M., Digital Game-Based Learning (2007) Paragon House, St. Paul; Erhel, S., Eric, J., Digital game-based learning: Impact of instructions and feedback on motivation and learning effectiveness (2013) Comput.

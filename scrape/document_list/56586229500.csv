To achieve that focus, enterprise has to improve its performance and comply with the customer feedback and requirement. This paper has objectives to provide analysis in both theoretical aspects and its empirical aspects of PT. PERTAMINA, within its Shipping Department in Oil and Gas Company. Precisely, this paper discussion on service quality improvement is needed on a charter out functions. Furthermore, the discussion is reinforced with the application using one of simulation software, known as ARENA Simulation. The limitation of this paper constitutes the discussion of Quality Function Deployment (QFD) in Shipping Department. The problems are further originated from the current level of both service quality of 63.87% and customer satisfaction of 71% that still trigger problem. Thus, the recommendation and conclusions are elaborated in this paper through its results. The mentioned results constitute the ground for further improvement for both theoretical and empirical aspects for future research. © Research India Publications.","ARENA simulation; Oil and Gas; Quality function deployment; Service quality; State owned enterprise",,,,,,"Ariani, D.W., (1999) Manajemen Kualitas, , Yogyakarta: Andi Offset; Cohen, L., (1995) Quality Function Deployment How to Make QFD Work for You, , United States of America: Addison Wesley; (2013) Global 500, , http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/2013/snapshots/11815.html, Retrieved Oktober 18, dari CNNMoney; Foster, S.T., (2004) Managing Quality an Integrative Approach, , United State of America: Pearson Education, Inc; (2013) ARENA 14.0 Simulation Software TRAINING, , Jakarta: Integrated Industrial Engineering Laboratory; Kruasoma, T., Saenchaiyathon, K., (2015) Achievement a Sustainable Competitive Advantageon the Integration of Resource-Based View and Dynamic Capability; Neely, A., (2013) INNOVATION AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE:A LITERATURE REVIEW, , http://ecsocman.hse.ru/data/696/521/1221/litreview_innov1.pdf, Retrieved Oktober 18, dari; Persero, P.P., (2012) Customer Satisfaction Level Survey, , Jakarta; Humpuss, P.T., (2012) Laporan Tahunan, , Jakarta: PT.

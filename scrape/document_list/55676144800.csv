Each structure has its own axioms and properties. In some cases, to test what kind of structure is a given set and operations is difficult to be done manually. To help this, an application program to test algebraic structures is developed. In this article, we focus on two structures: division ring and fields, and an application program to test them is created by using Java, an open-source based programming language. This application program provides testing of various input of finite set such as integers, matrices and alphabets. By this application, testing of algebraic structures can be done faster than the manual one and its results are accurate. In this article, we focus on testing division rings and fields, together with some examples. © 2015 The Authors.

It is useful in the development of solving method of problems that are abstract and difficult to test and represent through common algebraic operations. Thus, an open source-based computer program was developed to evaluate and prove a mathematical group structure. Several groups that are able to be tested and proved are aperiodic group, periodic group, mixed group, factor group, and normal subgroups. The developed program results showed that the evaluation of several types of the groups mentioned above performed well and perfect with a relatively shorter time than the manual test. In this program, the Java programming language was used since it can run well on several different operating system platforms. Besides, it is also able to be published free, so that programmers or other researchers can develop the application program further by adding more useful features. © 2013 Ngarap Im.

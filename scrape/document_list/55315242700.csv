Risk assessment is conducted on the system and recommendation of control is provided to help cloud provider in Indonesia to reduce risks. The assessment result should increase level of awareness to threats in cloud environment and help consumers to choose the right cloud providers. At the end, this paper can be used as a guide for Indonesian government to prepare the required infrastructure by cloud providers to run their business in Indonesia. © 2012 IEEE.","Cloud computing; Cloud security; Data centre; Risk assessment","Cloud providers; Comparative studies; Data centres; Indonesia; Risk assessment; Cloud computing",,,,,"Kundra, V., (2011), http://seekingalpha.com/article/283444-cutting-government-spendingwith- cloud-computing, july; Saleem, R., (2011) What's New about Cloud Computing Security?; Sihotang, J., (2011), http://www.slideshare.net/jhotank62/cloud-computing-fundamental, january; Mather, T., Data Leakage Prevention and Cloud Computing, , http://www.kpmg.com/Globa1/Pages/default.aspx; NIST Special Publications on Guide for Conducting Risk Assessment, , http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-30-rev1/SP800-30-Rev1-ipd. pdf; Landoll, D.J., (2006) The Security Risk Assesment Handbook, , Boca Raton: Taylor & Francis Group; (2009) Security Guidance for Cloud Computing, , Cloud Security Alliance.

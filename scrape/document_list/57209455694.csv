The research method used in this research is associative method. Data analysis is done using quantitative methods by distributing questionnaires to 332 randomly across Indonesia to all correspondents who are online transportation consumers. The results show that there is a significant influence on perceived convenience, user interface and user experience, and consumer innovativeness towards customer satisfaction, as well as consumer innovativeness on customer satisfaction, while online shopping attitude shows no influence. Therefore, online transportation company in Indonesia should focus more on the factors that have a positive and significant influence on their customer satisfaction, which are perceived convenience, user interface and user experience, and consumer innovativeness. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Electronic commerce; Sales; Surveys; User interfaces; Associative method; Consumer Innovativeness; Indonesia; Online shopping; Quantitative method; research methods; User experience; Customer satisfaction",,,,,"Mahatma, R., (2016) Berita E-commerce Indonesia, , https://buattokoonline.id/data-statistik-mengenai-pertumbuhan-pangsa-pasar-e-commerce-di-indonesia-saat-ini/; Park, J., Modeling user experience: A case study on a mobile device (2013) International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, 43 (2), pp. 187-196; Nysveen, H., Pedersen, P.E., Skard, S., Brand Experiences in Service Organizations: Exploring the Individual Effects of Brand Experience Dimensions (2013) Journal of Brand Management, 20 (5), pp. 404-423; Frambach, R.T., Roest, H.C.A., Krishnan, T.V., The Impact of Consumer Internet Experience on Channel Preference and Usage Intentions Across the Different Stages of the Buying Process (2007) Journal of Interactive Marketing, 21 (2), p. 26; Hung, S.Y., Chen, C.C., Huang, N.H., An Integrative Approach to Understanding Customer Satisfaction with E-Service of Online Stores (2014) Journal of Electronic Commerce Research, 57; Jiradilok, T., Malisuwan, S., Madan, N., Sivaraks, J., The Impact of Customer Satisfaction on Online Purchasing: A Case Study Analysis in Thailand (2014) Journal of Economics, Business and Management, pp. 1-7; Hoehle, H., Venkatesh, V., (2015) Mobile Application Usability: Conceptualization and Instrument Development, pp. 435-472; Soto-Acosta, P., Molina-Castilo, F.J., Lopez-Nicolas, C., Colomo-Palacios, R., (2014) The Effect of Information Overload and Disorganisation on Intention to Purchase Online, pp. 543-561; Sorooshian, S., Salimi, M., Salehi, M., Nia, N.B., Customer Experience about Service Quality in Online Environment: A case of Iran (2013) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 93, pp. 1681-1695; Sridevi, S., User interface design (2014) Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology Research, pp. 415-426; Pudjiastuti, S.S.R., The Effect Service Quality to Customer Satisfaction and Customer Loyalty of Argo Bromo Anggrek Train Jakarta-Surabaya in Indonesia (2013) IOSR Journal of Business and Management, pp. 33-38; Akroush, M.N., Al-Debei, M.M., An integrated model of factors affecting consumer attitudes towards online shopping (2015) Business Process Management Journal, 21 (6), pp. 1353-1370; Yasmin, A., Effectiveness of Digital Marketing in the Challenging Age: An Empirical Study (2015) Journal of Management Science and Business Administration, pp. 69-80",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Advance and Scientific Innovation, ICASI 2018","23 April 2018 through 24 April 2018",,148653,17426588,,,,"English","J.

Eco-friendly layout term in this study means the layout produced a minimal bed scouring at the bottom of the structures. In this research, we studied the hydrodynamic flow caused by tsunami wave's propagation on the bearing walls in coastal area. This flow which occur in 2 (two) bearing wall layout variations were analysed using the Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modelling program. The data and condition of the simulation are utilizing the bathymetric and topographic data of coastal area in the south of Yogyakarta, Java Island Indonesia. The simulation result shows that wave propagation reduction of square bearing wall 45° and 0° layout are 52,99% and 59%, respectively. The square bearing wall 0° is not recommended to be applied due to its highest tsunami wave impact force on the wall structure. The square bearing wall of 0° has a higher shear force and lateral force. This forces can caused an unstable structure wall. The wave impact forces on wall structure area and layout is important parameter for changing the scouring parameter influenced. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

This comes to a result that the identity of a product or a building façade will commonly generate in the same way that the initial design was intended to. Rectifying the early model will then greatly impact the process later. The aim of this paper is to propose a way to solve these two challenges, without risking the manufacturing process, but more to explore the potential designs. Shape grammar is used to conceive more designs in the early stage, derived from the initial product - the modular adaptive façade system. The derivations are then tested through simulation to state the efficacy of the models. We find that the workflow somehow contributes to the better design and engineering process as well as the solution allows diversification in the façade expressions. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","adaptive façade; design tool; energy efficient; shape grammar","Computer aided manufacturing; Energy efficiency; Manufacture; Product design; Design tool; Energy efficient; Engineering process; Initial design; Manufacturing phase; Manufacturing process; Mass production; Shape grammars; Bridges",,,,,,"Bougdah, H., Sharples, S., (2010) Environment, Technology and Sustainability, , (London: Taylor amp; Francis); Perez, R., Ineichen, P., Steals, R., Michalsky, J., Stewart, R., Modeling daylight availability and irradiance components from direct and global irradiance (1990) Solar Energy, 44 (5), pp. 271-289; (2009) Buildings and Climate Change - Summary for Decision Makers, , UNEP, (United Nations Environment Programme); (2008) A National Green Building Reseach Agenda, , USGBC Research Committee, (US Green Building Council); Sjarifudin, F.U., Adaptive Building Envelope System using Parametric Camshaft Mechanism for Energy Efficient Building (2012) Applied Mechanics and Materials, 232, pp. 919-924; Sjarifudin, F.U., Adaptive System Development for Secondary Skin (2014) Applied Mechanics and Material, 534, pp. 125-130; Sjarifudin, F.U., Justina, L., Daylight Adaptive Shading Using Parametric Camshaft Mechanism for SOHO in Jakarta ICASCE 2013 - International Conference on Advances Science and Contemporary, , (Jakarta, 2014); Sjarifudin, F.U., Parametric Camshaft Mechanism for Adaptive Building Envelope and Kinetic Building Ornaments (2014) Key Engineering Material, 572, pp. 225-228. , 6 January; Stiny, G., (2006) Shape: Talking about Seeing and Doing, , (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press); Gips, J., (1999) Computer Implementation of Shape Grammars, Workshop on Shape Computation, , http://www.shapegrammar.org/implement.pdf, [Online]; Duarte, J.P., (2005) ECAADe 21 Digital Design, , (Lisbon) A Discursive Grammar for Customizing Mass Housing; Li, A.I.-K., Liang Chen, Y.W., Editing shapes in a prototype two- and three-dimensional shape grammar environment (2009) Computation: The New Realm of Architectural Design: Proceedings of the 27th Conference on Education and Research in Computer Aided Architectural Design in Europe, , (Istanbul,) H.

Nowadays in urban areas, those ornaments become less popular for they are considered oldfashioned and due to the lack of technical function that matches with the modern building designs. Based on those issue, this paper proposed a type of building skin that aimed to revive a new expression of traditional decorative elements by applying digital design tools and technology as well as having an adaptive function. Traditional decorative ornaments merged in an adaptive skin that used traditional patterns as a controller of the effect of environmental changes in a building could provide a new expression of the use of traditional ornaments on a building in accordance with the times. Most of the adaptive building skin used kinetic techniques in order to make its formation and pattern transformable. This paper proposed a parametric-cam mechanism to transform the pattern of traditional ornament using preprogrammed analysis data of environmental changes to parametrically drive the number of rotation phase and length of nose that generated the shape of the cams. In conclusion, this paper has developed a prototypical tool that facilitates the new approach to kinetic decorative ornaments on building skin. © 2016 All rights reserved and published by The Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia.","Adaptive building skin; Building technology; Camshaft mechanism; Decorative ornaments; Kinetic building","Biological systems; Buildings; Cams; Design; Digital storage; Kinetics; Adaptive functions; Building skins; Building technologies; Decorative ornaments; Digital design tools; Environmental change; Technical functions; Traditional architecture; Architectural design",,,,,,"Hansanuwat, R., (2010) Kinetic Facades as Environmental Control Systems: Using Kinetic Facades to Increase Energy Efficiency and Building Performance in Office Buildings, , Master of Building Science Thesis, University of Southern California; Ochoa, C.E., Capeluto, I.G., Strategic decision-making for intelligent buildings: Comparative impact of passive design strategies and active features in a hot climate (2008) Building and Environment, 43, pp. 1829-1839; Skavara, M.E., Learning emergence (2009) Adaptive Cellular Automata Façade Trained by Artificial Neural Networks, , Master of Science in Adaptive Architecture & Computation Thesis, Bartlett UCL; Tri, U.S.H., National strategies research guide 2012 (2012) Ministry of Education and Culture, , Directorate General of Higher Education, Indonesia; Tzempelikos, T., Integration of dynamic facades with other building systems (2007) Automated Buildings Magazine; Sjarifudin, F.U., Parametric camshaft mechanism for adaptive building envelope and kinetic building ornaments (2014) Key Engineering Materials, 572, pp. 225-322; Wang, J., Li, J., Bio-inspired kinetic envelope for building energy efficiency based on parametric design of building information modeling (2010) Power and Energy Engineering Conference, , IEEE","Sjarifudin, F.U.; Bina Nusantara UniversityIndonesia; email: fsjarifudin@binus.edu","Schnabel M.A.Nakapan W.Roudavski S.Chien S.-F.Kim M.J.Choo S.","","The Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA)","21st International Conference on Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia: Living Systems and Micro-Utopias: Towards Continuous Designing, CAADRIA 2016","30 March 2016 through 2 April 2016",,121533,,9789881902672,,,"English","CAADRIA, Int.

PV cell can converts solar radiation into electricity and as the consequence the remaining heat is lesser than that of the concrete roof. Based on this principal theory, this study focused on investigating the level of irradiance of a roof top made of PV modules. The construction process of the PV modules was conducted through simulation and parametric study in order to obtain not only an optimum irradiance level, but also to create an aesthetic form. In order to facilitate that objective, this study consists of 3 steps: (1) to determine the required parameter, (2) to construct all the required parameter into an algorithm and (3) to execute the constructed algorithm.

Initially, a method of restructuring the composition of the diagram to three-dimensional space is applied to reduce some of the obscurities. Secondly, the composition of the diagram is recomposed to four-dimensional hyperspace to clarify of the correlations that exist in the diagram. Furthermore, a three-dimensionally projected model and interface to control all the four-dimensional axes were developed to visually verify the clarification.

The method of the research is by simulating the SOHO unit with variation of shading opening angles in order to adapt to each unit. Analysis done to every shading opening angle to get the appropriate daylight intensity level which support the work activities in every unit for the whole day. In order for the shading to be able to adapt to the changing daylight condition, previously developed parametric camshaft mechanism was used. The study found that the visual comfort for SOHO with creative industries workers in Jakarta can be achieve by varying the shading opening angles between 15-75°. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,,"Akmal, I., (2008) SOHO: Small Office Home Office; Tzempelikos, T., Integration of dynamic facades with other building systems (2007) Automated Buildings Magazine, , May; Ochoa, C.E., Capeluto, I.G., Strategic decision- making for intelligent buildings: Comparative impact of passive design strategies and active features in a hot climate (2008) Building and Environment, 43, pp. 1829-1839; Hansanuwat, R., (2010) Kinetic Facades As Environmental Control Systems: Using Kinetic Facades to Increase Energy Efficiency and Building Performance in Office Buildings, , Master of Building Science Thesis, University of Southern California, May; Skavara, M.E., (2009) Learning Emergence, Adaptive Cellular Automata Façade Trained by Artificial Neural Networks, , Master of Science in Adaptive Architecture & Computation Thesis, Bartlett UCL, September; Wang, J., Li, J., Bio-inspired kinetic envelope for building energy efficiency based on parametric design of building information modeling (2010) Power and Energy Engineering Conference, IEEE; Wang, J., Li, J., Chen, X., Parametric design based on building information modeling for sustainable buildings (2010) International Conference on Challenges in Environmental Science and Computer Engineering, IEEE; Sullivan, C.C., (2006) Robo Buildings.

In order to meet this growing challenge, this paper propose an adaptive building envelope system that can optimize its configuration by responding to environmental changes that could achieve new levels of sustainable performance and energy efficiency. Most of the current adaptive building envelope uses kinetic techniques in order to make its formation transformable. However, with the use of kinetic components such as a large amount of interactive motorized system that require electrical power may also cause further decrease the building energy efficiency. This paper proposes a camshaft mechanism system for adaptive building envelope that uses less motors, controllers, and sensors. This system uses pre-programmed analysis data of daily solar radiation changes to parametrically drive the number of rotation phase and length of nose (Lobe Lift) that generates the shape of camshaft. This camshaft then controls the changing opening and closing values of the building envelope components. The advantages of this system are less energy consumption, less maintenance and lower cost since it uses less motors, controllers and wiring. In conclusion, this paper has developed a prototypical tool that facilitates the new approach to energy efficient kinetic buildings. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Adaptive building envelope; Camshaft mechanism; Energy efficiency; Kinetic building","Building energy efficiency; Building envelopes; Electrical power; Energy efficient; Environmental change; Radiation change; Rotation phase; Sustainable building; Sustainable performance; System use; Aerospace engineering; Camshafts; Climate change; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Intelligent buildings; Kinetics; Solar buildings; Sun; Sustainable development; Adaptive control systems",,,,,,"Tzempelikos, T., Integration of Dynamic Facades with other Building Systems (2007) Automated Buildings Magazine, , May; Ochoa, C.E., Capeluto, I.G., Strategic decision- making for intelligent buildings: Comparative impact of passive design strategies and active features in a hot climate (2008) Building and Environment, 43, pp. 1829-1839; Hansanuwat, R., (2010) Kinetic Facades As Environmental Control Systems: Using Kinetic Facades to Increase Energy Efficiency and Building Performance In Office Buildings,Master of Building Science Thesis, , University of Southern California, May; Skavara, M.E., (2009) Learning Emergence, Adaptive Cellular Automata Façade Trained By Artificial Neural Networks,"" Master of Science In Adaptive Architecture & Computation Thesis, , Bartlett UCL, September; Wang, J., Li, J., Bio-Inspired Kinetic Envelope for Building Energy Efficiency based on Parametric Design of Building Information Modeling,"" Power and Energy Engineering Conference (2010) IEEE; Wang, J., Li, J., Chen, X., Parametric Design Based on Building Information Modeling for Sustainable Buildings,"" International Conference on Challenges in Environmental Science and Computer Engineering (2010) IEEE; Sullivan, C.C., Robo Buildings.

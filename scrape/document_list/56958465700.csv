Indonesia is a developing country which has a great enthusiasm for Internet technology. In history, the Indonesian government began developing the Internet in the early 1980s at the state universities in Indonesia.

Since then, the Indonesian community began to recognize the internet-based activity. However, the progress of the Internet in Indonesia also has an impact on behavior change for young generation. This article shows to the government, parents and internet users in Indonesia how shall we manage the advancement of the Internet. © 2017 IEEE.","Behavior; Generation; Internet; Networking; Online; Social media","Developing countries; Students; Behavior; Generation; Networking; Online; Social media; Internet",,,,"Binus University","This work was supported in part by Bina Nusantara University under BINUS Research Grant.","(2015) Profil Pengguna Internet Indonesia 2014, , Association of Internet Service Provider Indonesia, APJII, January, (references); (2016) Penetrasi Dan Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia 2016, , Association of Internet Service Provider Indonesia, APJII, November, (references); Briggs, F., (2011) Smart Parenting for Safer Kids, pp. 103-140. , Australia: Jojo Publishing; Broto, G.D., (2014) Siaran Pers Tentang Riset Kominfo Dan UNICEF Mengenai Perilaku Anak Dan Remaja Dalam Menggunakan Internet, , in Siaran Pers No. 17/PIH/KOMINFO/2/2014; Bolton, R., Understanding generation y and their use of social media: A review and research agenda (2013) Journal of Service Management Emerald Group Publishing Limited, 24, pp. 245-267. , April, references; Burhanuddin, T., New consumer behaviour (2015) Majalah Marketing, 5, pp. 15-17; Fajrina, H.N., (2015) Orang Indonesia Pilih Internet Daripada Mandi, , in Press CNN Indonesia, April; Garcia, C., Engaged youth in the internet.

Among all characters that are integral to the professional attitude is the ability to manage time ideally which is known as time management skills. This skill is so much decisive for the promotion of one’s career that requires the students to build a good habit of effective time management. This research attempts to describe how the above average level students (with GPA above 2.8) of double degree program manage their time. By using the method of direct observation and interviews, the research found that their academic achievement is so much determined by their ability to manage time. Their good time management habit significantly constitutes their professional attitude which would define their career progress in the future. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Character; Discipline; Professionalism; Time management",,,,,,,"Covey, S.R., (1998) The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, , Binarupa Aksara, Jakarta; de Janasz, S.C., (2009) Interpersonal Skills in Organizations, , McGraw Hill, Boston; Claessens, J.C.B., Van Eerde, W., Rutte, G.C., Roe, R., A Review of Time Management Literatur (2007) Personnel Review, 36, pp. 255-276; Macan, T.H., Shahani, C., Dipboye, R.L., Phillips, A.P., (1990) Journal of Educational Psychology, 82, p. 760; Yager, J., (2004) Creative Time Management, , Bhuana Ilmu Populer, Jakarta; Hamzah, A.R., Lucky, E.O., Joarder, M.H., Time Management, External Motivation, and Students’ Academic Performance: Evidence from a Malaysian Public University (2014) Asian Social Science, 10, pp. 55-63; Kirillov, A.V., Tanatova, D.K., Vinichenko, M.V., Makushkin, S.A., Theory and Practice of Time-Management in Education (2015) Asian Social Science, 11, pp. 193-204; Yukselturk, E., Bulut, S., Predictors for Student Success in an Online Course (2007) Educational Technology and Society, 10, pp. 71-83; Lay, H.C., Schouwenburg, H., (1993) Journal of Social Behavior and Personality, 8, p. 647","Martoredjo, N.T.; Character Building Development Center, Indonesia",,,"American Scientific Publishers",,,,,19366612,,,,"English","Adv.

This question is very important because the languages about God are foundations of a community of faith. In the languages about God, people put the primary symbol of the whole religious system. Hence the ways in which a community of faith shapes languages about God implicitly represents what it takes to be the highest good. Such speaking, in turn, powerfully molds the identity of the community and directs its praxis. This article will discuss a need for inclusive languages of God. The author shares the suggestion of Elizabeth Schüssler Fiorenza that those who are excluded from institutions of knowledge and power must be allowed to participate in articulating their perceptions and imaginations as to promote a more just, egalitarian and inclusive society. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.","Feminist theology; Languages about god; Patriarchy",,,,,,,"Faria, S., On Language and Sexism (1987) Jeevadhara, pp. 33-34. , January; McFague, S., (1983) Metaphorical Theology: Models of God in Religious Language, 6p. , SCM Press Ltd, London; McFague, S., (1983) Metaphorical Theology: Models of God in Religious Language, pp. 7-9. , SCM Press Ltd, London; Johnson, E.A., (1992) She Who Is: The Mystery of God in Feminist Theological Discourse, 38p. , Crossroad, New York; Chopp, R.S., (1989) The Power to Speak: Feminism, Language, God, Crossroad, 1p. , New York; Reuther, R.R., (1983) Sexism and God-Talk: Toward a Feminist Theology, 12p. , Beacon, Boston; Reuther, R.R., (1983) Sexism and God-Talk: Toward a Feminist Theology, pp. 18-19. , Beacon, Boston; Reuther, R.R., (1983) Sexism and God-Talk: Toward a Feminist Theology, 13p. , Beacon, Boston; Johnson, E.A., (1988) Chicago Studies, 27, p. 130; Johnson, E.A., (1992) She Who Is: The Mystery of God in Feminist Theological Discourse, 76p. , Crossroad, New York; Johnson, E.A., (1988) Chicago Studies, 27, p. 132; Vatican II's, Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, , Gaudium et Spes #29; Catechism of the Catholic Church no. 42; Reuther, R.R., (1983) Sexism and God-Talk: Toward a Feminist Theology, 20p. , Beacon, Boston; Schmidt, G.R., (1982) Worship, 56, p. 117","Lakonawa, P.; Binus UniversityIndonesia",,,"American Scientific Publishers",,,,,19366612,,,,"English","Adv.

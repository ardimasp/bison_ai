Design/methodology/approach: Research data was collected from the executive management of telecommunication technology providers in Indonesia via a questionnaire survey to obtain 150 valid questionnaires for analysis. This study analyzed the overall model fit through confirmatory factor analysis and causal relationships through structural equation modeling. Findings: The results indicate that market orientation mediates the link between balanced APM and strategic agility and that strategic agility mediates the link between market orientation and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The choice of single telecommunication industry in a single country, Indonesia, provides a limitation on external validity. It is, therefore, suggested to extend the research efforts to other industry sectors in multi-country environments. Originality/value: This study extends the knowledge about agile project management by embracing balancing control enforcement and tests it empirically. This study also re-conceptualizes strategic agility to embrace business partner switching capability and market orientation to embrace the inter-partner coordination dimension. Finally, the results highlight that agile project management needs to be framed by market orientation to create higher value for customers. However, market orientation alone is not enough and that the organization requires strategic agility to achieve firm performance. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Balanced agile project management; Firm performance; Firm performance; Market orientation; Strategic agility; Telecommunication",,,,,,"The authors are grateful to the Co-Editors, Assoc.

Design/methodology/approach: Research data were collected from the executive management of telecommunication technology providers in Indonesia via a questionnaire survey to obtain 150 valid questionnaires for analysis. This study analyzed the overall model fit and causal relationship using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings: The results indicate that market orientation fully mediates the link between networking capability-business process agility and balanced APM-business process agility. Furthermore, business process agility mediates the relationship between market orientation and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This study is based on a cross-sectional nature and might fail to capture the dynamic of the studied variables over an extended period. Originality/value: The study extends the knowledge that dynamic capabilities, represented by networking capability and balanced APM, must be framed by market orientation to create customer value and improve bargaining position. However, market orientation alone is not enough in a highly dynamic business environment. Organization also requires business process agility, responsiveness and adaptability to timely address customers' needs and requirements. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business process agility; Firm performance; Market orientation; Networking capability, Balanced agile project management",,,,,,,"Aghina, W., Smet, A.D., Lackey, G., Lurie, M., Murarka, M., (2018) The 5 trademarks of agile organizations, , https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/the-five-trademarks-of-agile-organizations; Agirre, I., Reinares, P., Agirre, A., Antecedents to market orientation in the worker cooperative organization: the Mondragon group (2014) Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, 85 (3), pp. 387-408; Aguirre, F.H., Azcoitia, S.A., Marcos, C.S., (2019) Disrupting Telco Business Through SDN/NFV, , Deloitte, Madrid; Ahlbäck, K., Fahrbach, C., Murarka, M., Salo, O., (2017) How to create an agile organization, , https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/how-to-create-an-agile-organization; Ahuja, G., The duality of collaboration: inducements and opportunities in the formation of interfirm linkages (2000) Strategic Management Journal, 21, pp. 317-343; Alavi, S., Wahab, D.A., Muhamad, N., Shirani, B.A., Organic structure and organisational learning as the main antecedents of workforce agility (2014) International Journal of Production Research, 52 (21), pp. 6273-6295; Alpkan, L., Yilmaz, C., Kaya, N., Market orientation and planning flexibility in SMEs: performance implications and an empirical investigation (2007) International Small Business Journal, 25 (2), pp. 152-172; Altay, N., Gunasekaran, A., Dubey, R., Childe, S.J., Agility and resilience as antecedents of supply chain performance under moderating effects of organizational culture within the humanitarian setting: a dynamic capability view (2018) Production Planning and Control, 29 (14), pp. 1158-1174. , Taylor and Francis; Ambroise, L., Prim-allaz, I., Teyssier, C., Financial performance of servitized manufacturing firms: a configuration issue between servitization strategies and customer-oriented organizational design (2017) Industrial Marketing Management, 71, pp. 54-68. , Elsevier; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: a review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 411-423; Anderson, E., Jap, S.D., The dark side of close relationships (2005) MIT Sloan Management Review, 46 (3), pp. 75-82; Andersson, T., Cäker, M., Tengblad, S., Wickelgren, M., Building traits for organizational resilience through balancing organizational structures (2019) Scandinavian Journal of Management, 35 (1), pp. 36-45. , Elsevier; Annosi, M.C., Magnusson, M., Martini, A., Appio, F.P., Social conduct, learning and innovation: an abductive study of the dark side of agile software development (2016) Creativity and Innovation Management, 25 (4), pp. 515-535; Arnett, D.B., Sandvik, I.L., Sandvik, K., Two paths to organizational effectiveness – product advantage and life-cycle flexibility (2018) Journal of Business Research, 84 (March), pp. 285-292; Atkinson, H., Brown, J.B., Rethinking performance measures: assessing progress in UK hotels (2001) International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 13 (3), pp. 128-136; Atuahene-Gima, K., Ko, A., An empirical investigation of the effect of market orientation and entrepreneurship orientation alignment on product innovation (2001) Organization Science, 12 (1), pp. 54-74; Bajpai, R., Nesargi, S., Merchant, K., Pareek, V., (2015) Operationalizing SDN and NFV Networks, , Deloitte Consulting LLP, Dallas, Texas; Balashova, E.S., Gromova, E.A., Agile project management in telecommunications industry (2017) Espacios, 38, p. 41; Barnabas, N., Mekoth, N., Autonomy, market orientation and performance in Indian retail banking (2010) Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics, 22 (3), pp. 330-350; Barney, J., Firm resource and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Barney, J.B., Ketchen, D.J., Wright, M., The future of resource-based theory: revitalization or decline?

Design/methodology/approach: Research data was collected from the executive management of telecommunication technology providers in Indonesia via a questionnaire survey to obtain 150 valid questionnaires for analysis. This study analysed the overall model fit and hypotheses through confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Findings: The results reveal that networking capability has a positive and significant effect on market orientation. However, networking capability does not have a significant direct effect on business process agility. The results also indicate that market orientation does not have a significant direct effect on firm performance but through the mediating role of business process agility. Practical implications: The findings provide a practical foundation for the organisation’s networking capability to be framed by market orientation and business process agility to enhance firm performance. Originality/value: The results indicate that market orientation mediates the relationship between networking capability and business process agility.

Furthermore, it also elaborates how organizational agility is shaped by the interdependence of the main antecedents―sales-marketing interdepartmental collaboration, complete market-oriented integrated product development (IPD) strategy, and nimble network structure. Exploratory case study and literature review are used to examine the interrelationship of organizational agility antecedents and to develop the conceptual framework. The study identifies that in highly dynamic, rapidly changing, and complex digitized business environments of Telecommunication 4.0 era, to achieve competitive advantage, organizations are required to become agile, which is becoming responsive and flexible in delivering continuous innovation and customer-focused solution through rapid experimentation and decisiveness. To fully gain organizational agility, the collaborative role of sales and marketing in guiding and supporting research and development (R&D) is crucial for product development success. Further, the whole organization needs to embrace an agile mindset and working under a nimble network structure and project management arrangement. Derived from resource dependence theory, the originality of this study lies on the elucidation of collaboration and integration among functional specialists working under nimble project-based network structure that bring positive impact on the accomplishment of product development collective task and responsiveness in satisfying customer’s requirement. This study is expected to enrich prior studies on organizational agility from a different perspective. © 2019 SERSC.","Business performance; Nimble network structure; Organizational agility; Product development; Sales and marketing collaboration",,,,,,,"Ravichandran, T., Exploring the relationships between IT competence, innovation capacity and organizational agility (2018) J.

As Telecommunication 4.0 brings up new challenges and complexities created by open innovation and integrated hardware and software, there is a necessity to further demonstrate how organisations leverage networking with partners and exploit internal organisational structural flexibility to fully gain IPM decision-making quality and organisational agility. This study aims to explore how IPM decision-making quality and organisational agility are influenced by a business intelligence system with the capability of providing profound market knowledge and orchestrating the organisations' networking capabilities in leveraging external capabilities with internal factors embedded in a nimble organisational structure that subsequently influences decision-making accuracy. Furthermore, the relationship of antecedents-a business intelligence system, networking capability, and nimble organisational structure-is elaborated in our conceptual research model. Exploratory case studies with four telecommunication equipment companies in Indonesia and a literature review are used to examine the relationship between IPM decision-making quality antecedents. Deriving from information processing theory, dynamic capability, and resource-based theory, the originality of this study lies in how organisations exploit not only internal resources and flexible organisational structure, but also in how it accesses, configures, and leverages external network resources embedded in business partners to come up with full access to IPM decision-making quality in an open innovation era. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","agility; business intelligence; decision-making; Innovation portfolio management; networking capability; nimble organisational structure",,,,,,,"Aghina, W., De Smet, A., Lackey, G., Lurie, M., Murarka, M., (2018) The 5 Trademarks of Agile Organisations, , https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organisation/our-insights/the-five-trademarks-of-agile-organisations, [Online].

Diverges from prior studies on organizational agility, the study identifies that a complete market orientation of integrated product development (IPD) implementation maximizes organization's responsiveness toward the dynamics of customers' requirements and competitors' activities. Furthermore, exploratory case studies find that as Telecommunication 4.0 brings up new challenges and complexities created by open innovation and hardware-software decoupling, organizations need to leverage networking with partners and exploit organizational structure nimbleness to gain optimal product development capability. The conceptual framework is formed from both the exploratory case studies and systematic literature review. The case studies enable us to gain state-of-the-art views from practitioners in the industry, clarify the fuzziness and broad nature of antecedents, and integrate them into existing theories to acquire managerial insight. Aligned with market-based and dynamic capability theory, the originality of this study lies on how organizations exploit not only internal resource flexibility, but also how to access, configure, and leverage external network capabilities embedded in business partners. © 2019 Chaoyang University of Technology.","Business performance; Business process agility; Integrated product development; Market-oriented; Networking capability; Nimble organizational structure",,,,,,,"Susanne, H., Jeff, L., Paul, S., (2018) Succeeding in the age of digital transformation: TMT Frontrunners lead the way for the Industry 4.0 revolution, , https://www2.deloitte.com/cz/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/succeeding-in-the-age-of-digital-transformation.html#; Zhengmao, L., (2018) Telecommunication 4.0: Reinvention of the Communication Network, , Singapore-Springer; Ahlbäck, K., Clemens, F., Monica, M., Olli, S., (2017) How to create an agile organization, , https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/how-to-create-an-agile-organization; (2018) Mobile & Telecom, , https://ihsmarkit.com/products/telecommunication-market.htm; Youngki, P., Omar, A.E.S., Peer, C.F., (2017) J.

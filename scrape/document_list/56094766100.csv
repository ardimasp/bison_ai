However, such studies tend to overlook on data and numbers rather than grounded and contextual turn. The present study used a contextual and qualitative analysis to investigate the identities and realities of university graduates through recurring themes and patterns in Twitter. Data for this case study was a corpus compiled from 345 tweets of 35 Twitter accounts of graduates from English Department in a private university in Indonesia. The corpus contained 4, 966 tokens and was analyzed using AntConc.3.5.8 (2019) for the recurring lexical use and collocations. Results showed that university graduates posed themselves as personally engaged, while formal addressing was used in rhetorical style. The graduates were also embalmed with issues related to work, parenting, marriage, and the current pandemic. The corpus also revealed the commonly collegiate style. The use of code-mixing between Indonesian and English in the tweets also further revealed the shared identity of the graduates. It could be concluded that social media postulated the lives and world of graduates and qualitative study of big data analysis could bring more comprehensive results. Implications for educators and university administrators in preparing students for life after university were included in the discussion. © 2020 IEEE.","Big data; Graduates; Identity; Twitter","Big data; Information management; Code-mixing; Indonesia; Qualitative analysis; Qualitative study; Social media; University graduates; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Cammaerts, B., Social media and activism (2015) Journal of American College Health Publications, 31, pp. 1-8; Felt, M., Social media and the social sciences: How researchers employ big data analytics (2016) Big Data & Society January-June, pp. 1-15; McCormick, T.H., Lee, H., Ceare, N., Shojaie, N., Spiro, E.S., Using twitter for demographic and social science research: Tools for data collection and processing (2015) Sociological Methods & Research, pp. 1-32; Sebei, H., Taieb, M.A.H., Aouicha, M.B., Review of social media analytics process and big data pipeline (2018) Social Network Analysis and Mining, 8, pp. 30-42; Sivarajaha, U., Irania, Z., Guptab, S., Mahroofa, K., Role of big data and social media analytics for business to business sustainability: A participatory web context (2019) Industrial Marketing Management, pp. 2-20. , April; Gutiérrez-Martín, A., Torrego-González, A., The twitter games: Media education, popular culture and multiscreen viewing in virtual concourses (2017) Information, Communication & Society; Noll, M., Technology and the future of the university: A sober view (2000) Information, Communication & Society, 3 (4), pp. 645-647; Armstrong, L., A new game in town: Competitive higher education (2001) Information, Communication & Society, 4 (4), pp. 479-506; Fleming, F., College students' alcohol displays on facebook: Intervention considerations (2012) Journal of American College Health, 60 (5), pp. 388-394; Bennett, L., Segerberg, A., The logic of connective action (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 739-768; Allen, K.A., Ryan, T., Gray-DeLeon, A., McInerenet, D., Waters, L., Social media use and social connectedness in adolescents: The positives and the potential pitfalls (2014) Australian Journal of Educational and Developmental Psychology, 31 (1), pp. 18-31; Jackson, M.H., McDowell, S.D., Enhancing discourse on new technology within higher education (2000) Information, Communication & Society, 3 (4), pp. 629-638; Brown, M.E., Dustman, P.A., Juan, J.B., Twitter impact on a community trauma: An examination of who, what, and why it radiated (2020) Community Psychology, 1, pp. 1-16; Puschmann, C., Burgess, J., (2014) The Politics of Twitter Data, pp. 43-54. , K.

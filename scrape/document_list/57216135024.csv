The product, however, probably characterize differently compared to meat-based sausages. This research was aimed to evaluate the effect of carrageenan on texture and organoleptic properties of wood-ear mushroom sausage. Five different concentrations of carrageenan (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10%) were preliminary assessed by using hedonic test to determine three of the most preferred samples which were sausage formulated with carrageenan 2, 6 and 8%. The results showed that different concentration of carrageenan altered texture attributes and overall liking of wood-ear mushroom sausage, with 2% carrageenan formulation as the most accepted sample. The proximate composition determination resulted 8.85% moisture, 12.27% ash, 8.58% protein, 11.03% fat, and 59.27% carbohydrate. Furthermore, it was characterized by texture attributes including 7849.78 ±3 66.382 g, 0.69 ± 0.036, 0.36 ± 0.012, 2858.95 ± 57.110, 1984.08 ± 122.868 for its hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness respectively. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Textures; Wood; Auricularia auricula; Carrageenans; Organoleptic properties; Proximate compositions; Saturated fats; Texture profile; Meats",,,,,"Abdolghafour, B., Saghir, A., Development in Sausage Production and Practices-A review Sausage Production: Ingredients and Raw (2014) J.

With a joint scheme, investors can buy a portion of project or business ownership with a relatively small nominal purchase. However, investors need tools to facilitate the search and purchase of projects or businesses that match their character. This research is intended to design a Web-based Crowdfunding Platform model that suits the needs of investors. This study uses the questionnaire method to obtain investor information requirements data. As for model designing, this study employed the Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) method, and used notation from the Unified Modeling Language (UML) standard. The result of this study is a Web-based Crowdfunding Platform model that facilitates investors to choose and arrange investment portfolios that are appropriate to their preferences. © 2020 IEEE.","Crowdfunding; Model; OOAD; UML","Information management; Investments; Object oriented programming; Purchasing; Unified Modeling Language; Websites; Business ownership; Information requirement; Investment portfolio; Object oriented analysis and design; Platform models; Stock exchange; Web based; Crowdsourcing",,,,,"Crowdfunding is a method of raising funds from many investors through an online platform to capitalize on startup company project instead of funding from banks or loan providers [7].

Information transparency is needed to maintain good governance and can also prevent corruption. However, information on the sustainability of development programs carried out by the government is much unknown to the public. In addition, the government must be burdened with public dissatisfaction due to fake news (hoax). The Ministry of Public Works has tried to build a website to disseminate its programs. However, measurement of the quality of the website is needed. This study uses questionnaires with a Likert scale to obtain user interface assessment data in accordance with the WebQual 4.0 method. This study shows that the easiness of the website to use has the highest correlation with how helpful the website is.

This research aims to test the usability of web http://www.indonesia.travel/en, at the end can give input to the Tourism Ministry of the Republic of Indonesia. The concept used based on usabilitygeek.com which mentions the three main categories for usability testing, i. e. explorative, assessment and comparative with the users are three classes of Communication Department students of Bina Nusantara University with a total of 120 students, however finally only 22 students were elected because of the criteria are the students should be like travelling and access to the tourism website more than 12 times. The methodology used is qualitative descriptive and experiments, with data collection techniques through observation and interviews after participants' access to the web: Due to their one-on-one nature, interviews enable the observer to ask direct questions to the user and the participants posted their opinion in online discussion forum. The results mentioned that the elements web of Wonderful Indonesia has a high learning ability and memorability but less efficiency and satisfaction, as well as several times errors when used. In conclusion, to maximize about the visit of tourism to Indonesia, this web is only able to learn and impress the visitor, but do not give satisfaction to users. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Students; Websites; Data collection; Foreign exchange; Indonesians; Learning abilities; Online discussion forums; Tourism promotion; Tourism websites; Usability testing; Web Design",,,,,,"Industri Pariwisata Indonesia, , https://www.indonesia-investments.com/id/bisnis/industri-sektor/pariwisata/item6051, Indonesia Investments 16 December 2016.

Dissemination of health information becomes a daunting task for the government. Data were collected from samples representing Indonesia, covering deaths throughout 2016, and at all deaths were verbal autopsies, according to World Health Organization guidelines in real time by doctors and trained personnel. From the data, it is seen that 10 types of diseases are the most common cause of death in Indonesia including cancer, cerebrovascular, and ischemic heart. But the information of 10 types of disease is still not common to the people of Indonesia. This research describes the design of a mobile application called 'I'm CARE'. The application is based on the 10 most dangerous diseases in Indonesia, as reported by the health information media. The research method used is data collection method that includes interviews with several specialist doctors. It also uses the method of analysis and database design that includes the design of the conceptual database, logical, and physical. Then using manual interaction computer to design user interface on mobile application and some machine learning models such as Decision Tree, k = Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The results achieved are the design of mobile-based application 'I'm CARE' model as a health information media about 10 diseases dangerous in Indonesia and prediction model of heart. The conclusion is that with the design of 'I'm CARE' mobile-based application model as health information media about 10 diseases dangerous disease in Indonesia and prediction model of heart hence dissemination of health information to Indonesian society can be improved and assist government in health area. © 2017 IEEE.","Health; Heart; I'm CARE; Mobile","Decision trees; Health; Heart; Information management; mHealth; Mobile computing; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Support vector machines; User interfaces; Application modeling; Data collection method; Health informations; Machine learning models; Mobile; Mobile applications; Mobile health application; World Health Organization; Information dissemination",,,,,,"Statistik, B.P., (2014) Persentase Penduduk Daerah Perkotaan Menurut Provinsi, 2010-2035, , https://www.bps.go.id/linkTabelStatis/view/id/1276, [Online]; Utarini, A., Djasri, H., Keselamatan Pasien dan Mutu Pelayan Kesehatan: Menuju Kemana?

So, the university can win the competition with other universities in line with increasing the society needs of formal education. The object of this research is one of the universities in Jakarta, Indonesia, whereas the focus is the feature or variable of user friendly and menu to satisfaction variable on the web which supports the teaching and learning process in university. Nowadays, the introduction of E-Learning system prepares student learning material as online access is becoming widespread trend, especially at the university. The research aims to find out user friendly features and menu which is influence learning process on the web at one of university in Jakarta, as a consideration reference for university leader for taking a policy as a way to increase the learning system quality. The method for this research is the use of literature study, questionnaire for lecturer and university students on odd semester 2013/2014 with the use of likert scales shown that university student of variable X1 is neutral or user is satisfied or unsatisfied. Meanwhile, most of X2 variable is neutral, the user said that they were satisfy with D-10 with the score is 1723, and then for the Y variable is the user satisfaction toward web is neutral.

Before investing information system it is necessary to conduct a feasibility study on running information systems in order to obtain an overview of the support that can be provided by the old system. The method of this study was performed by conducting surveys and interviews for data collection and analysis methods with fit gap analysis, cost benefit analysis and information technology balanced scorecard. The results of this study by using a fit gap analysis showed that only 10% of the system running with fit criteria, so it is necessary to change the system. Proposed new system will provide a 3.9 year payback period of 5 years management estimates. Average achievement by using information technology balanced scorecard is 93.5%. The conclusion that can be drawn from this study is the firm should invest in hospitality management information system by looking at the aspects of operational and financial aspects. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

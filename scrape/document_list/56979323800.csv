By using this technology, Learning Management System (LMS) can provide an unimpeded interaction for their users and promote awareness for any information updates. It is crucial to develop mobile application for each major mobile platform to reach most of the LMS user. In this paper, the mobile application development was done by combining native mobile technology and web technology using WebView API. This approach was taken to anticipate the need for creating and maintaining the application on multiple mobile platform and was expected to cut development time frame while retaining consistent interface and still enable platform specific's feature usage. The purpose of this study is to review the strengths and weaknesses of such combination in mobile application development specifically under android platform. © 2015 The Authors.

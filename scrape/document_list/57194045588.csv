The burden of public vehicle drivers such bus driver is heavier, since they are dealing with the traffic during their work. Nowday, Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) becomes one of highly demanded transportation system for Jakartans and worker from urban area. In this background, research on fatigue from driving addressing BRT's driver becomes a critical issue in ensuring safe operation. In this study a workload evaluation, sleepiness, motivation level, self-rated fatigue and salivary amylase test was established to evaluate fatigue level of BRT driver from 2 different shifts (45 participants). Data collected directly during BRT's driver was on duty, before and after their services. Based on anova analysis, it reveals that different shift could affect fatigue levels (p<0,05) based on SOFI result, although workload each shift is similar. The study also show that 27% more driver are in stress condition before starting their task in morning-shift. Suprisingly, driver's motivation level among shift is not differ. As a conclusion, early shift had a larger influence on stress and sleepiness level on BRT driver, a rotation schedule may help to overcome the problem. © IEOM Society International. © IEOM Society International.","Driver fatigue; Shift; Stress; Time-of-day",,,,,,"In year Sixth become more popular (2013) Bus Transjakarta Semakin Diminati di Usia ke-6, , www.jakarta.go.id/v2/news/2010/01/Bus-Transjakarta-Semakin-Diminati-di-Usia-ke-6#.UXc1Ia7pbRQ, from Jakarta.go.id; Aldrich, T.B., Szabo, S.M., Bierbaum, C.R., The development and application of model to predict operator workload during system design (1988), http://sunburst.usd.edu,http://sunburst.usd.edu/~schieber/psyc792/workload/Aldrich1988.pdf, Retrieved 5 20, 2013; Bierbaum, C., Szabo, S., Aldirch, T.B., Task Analysis of the UH-60 Mission and Decision Rules for Developing a UH-60 Workload Prediction Model (1989), US Army R&D Activity, Fort Rucker, AL; Yee, S., Nguyen, L., Green, P., Oberholtzer, J., Miller, B., Visual, Auditory, Cognitive, and Psychomotor Demands of Real In-Vehicle Tasks (2006), Technical Report, Univeristy of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, USA; Wickens, C.D., Multipe Resources and performance prediction (2002) Ergonomic Science, 3 (2), pp. 159-177; Williamson, A., Lombardi, D.A., Folkard, S., Stuts, J., Courtney, T.K., Connor, J.L., The link between fatigue and safety (2011) Accident Analysis and Prevention, 43, pp. 498-515; Ingre, M., Keclund, G., Åkerstedt, T., Keclund, L., Variation in Sleepiness during Early Morning Shifts; A Mixed Model Approach to an Experimental Field Study of Train Drivers (2004) Chronobiology International, 21 (6), pp. 973-990; Johns, M.W., What is Esxcessive Daytime Sleepiness (2009) Sleep Deprivation: Causes, Effects and Treatment, , Nova Science Publisher, Inc; Philip, P., Sagaspe, P., Moore, N., Taillard, J., Charles, A., Guilleminault, C., Bioulac, B., Fatigue, sleep restriction and driving performance (2005) Accident Analysis and Prevention, 37, pp. 473-478; Rupp, T., Concepts of Fatigue, Sleepiness, and Alertness (2013) Encyclopedia of Sleep, pp. 24-26; Shahid, A., Shen, J., Shapiro, C.M., Measurement of sleepiness and Fatigue (2010) Journal of Psychosomatic Research, 69, pp. 81-89; Shen, J., Barbera, J., Shapiro, C.M., Distinguish sleepiness and fatigue: focus on definition and measurement (2006) Sleep Medicine Reviews, 10, pp. 63-76; Kovalevent, R.D., Hinz, A., Brahler, E., Klapp, B.F., Determinant of Fatigue and Stress (2010) Biomedical Research Note, 4, p. 238; Hobson, J., Beach, J.R., An investigation of the relationship between psychological health and workload among managers (2000) Ocupational Med., 50 (7), pp. 518-522; Reyner, L.A., Wells, S.J., Mortlock, V., Horne, J.A., Post-lunch' sleepiness during prolonged, monotonous driving-effects of meal size (2012) Physiology & Behavior, 105, pp. 1088-1091; Minowa, C., Koitabashi, K., Salivary alpha-amylase activity-an Indicator of relaxation response in perioperative patients (2012) Open Journal of Nursing, 2, pp. 208-214; Connor, J., Whitlock, G., Norton, R., Jackson, R., Role of driver sleepiness in car crashes: a systematic review of epidemiological studies (2001) Accident Analysis and Prevention, 33, pp. 31-41; Kaida, K., Åkerstedt, T., Kecklund, G., Nilsson, J.P., Axesson, J., Use of subjective and Physiological Indicators of Sleepiness to Predict Performance during a Vigilance Task (2007) Industrial Health, 45, pp. 520-526; Yamaguchi, M., Kanmori, T., Kanemaru, M., Takai, N., Mizuno, Y., Yoshida, H., Performance evaluation of salivary amylase activity monitor Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 20, pp. 491-497; Sakabibra, T., Wang, Z., Kasai, Y., Does going to an amusement park alleviate low back pain?

However, different type of ownership will have different level of conflict. Family ownership is deemed to be more affected by agency problem type II. Using the data of Kompas 100 listed firms in Indonesia, this study aims to comprehend the effect of a family ownership and its level of accounting conservatism. The study also analyses the correlation between managerial ownership toward the level of accounting conservatism. Findings show that family business significantly affects the level of accounting conservatism. In contrast, this study cannot find any effect on managerial ownership on the degree of accounting conservatism.","Accounting conservatism; Agency problem type I; Agency problem type II; Family business; Indonesia listed firms; Managerial ownership",,,,,,"Ahmed, A.S., Duellman, S., Accounting conservatism and board of director characteristics: An empirical analysis (2007) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 43 (2), pp. 411-437; Ali, A., Chen, T.Y., Radhakrishnan, S., Corporate disclosures by family firms (2007) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 44 (1), pp. 238-286; Anderson, R.C., Reeb, D.M., Foundingfamily ownership and firm performance: Evidence from the S&P 500 (2003) Journal of Finance, 58, pp. 1301-1328; Ball, R., Robin, A., Sadka, G., Is financial reporting shaped by equity markets or by debt markets?

The data for this study is collected using survey technique. The total number of respondents for this study were 94 people, which all of them are game players with the minimum age of 15 years old. The experiment results show that our model can predict Openness, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness personality traits from the game character design selected before playing games with the average accuracy of 66.7%. © 2017 IEEE.","artificial neural network; game character design; machine learning; ocean; personality prediction","Forecasting; Internet of things; Neural networks; Character designs; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning models; ocean; Personality predictions; Personality traits; Prediction-based; Survey techniques; Learning systems",,,,,"John, O.P., Srivastava, S., The big five trait taxonomy: History, measurement, and theoretical perspectives (1999) Handb.

Children are not only able to influence parents to purchase their personal consumption but also other important things such as cars, electronic devices or even vacations (Tinson et al, 2008). Literature reviews from various sources will be collected which discuss family tourism, children’s influence power in the decision-making process and tourism in Indonesia. This qualitative research focuses on 16 children’s traveling patterns, preferred travel destinations and also their influential power in the decision-making process of choosing a travel destination at Medan, Indonesia. Each stage of the decision-making process will be analyzed in detail according to different types of age groups and family structures. Furthermore, children will be investigated on their traveling pattern and preferred travel destination by comparing with family income level and family structures. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Dogan Gursoy and Christina G.

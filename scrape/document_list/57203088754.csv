Applications generated from this research can provide convenience to the user to control electronic devices via Android. The analytical methodology used is literature study, and comparison of similar applications. The development methodology used is the Scrum method and uses UML in designing and modeling applications. Electronic control systems are designed with Arduino, relays, and sensors for electronic monitoring. The connectivity used to control is Bluetooth, to be able to control every electronic device must first connect to the specified Bluetooth. The results achieved are Android applications that can be used to control and electronic monitoring. The results of this study in the form of SHARC application proved to provide convenience and help users to control electronics. © 2020 IEEE.","Android; Arduino; Bluetooth; Electronic devices; SHARC","Bluetooth; Electronic equipment; Information management; Thermoelectric equipment; Analytical methodology; Android applications; Control electronics; Design and application; Development methodology; Electronic control systems; Electronic monitoring; Literature studies; Android (operating system)",,,,,"Will A Smartphone Replace Your Pc, , http://www.govtech.com/blogs/lohrmann-on-cybersecurity/will-asmartphone-replace-your-pc.html, [Accessed: 18-Sep-2017]; (2017) A Simple Explanation of 'The Internet of Things', , https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2014/05/13/simpleexplanation-internet-things-that-anyone-can-understand/#41f321951d09, Accessed: 21-Jun; Withanage, C., Ashok, R., Yuen, C., Otto, K., A comparison of the popular home automation technologies (2014) 2014 IEEE Innov.

But the shipping process still encountered several obstacles, such as: lack of skills to pack the shipped goods, time to go and queue to the Expedition Company as well as information on shipping expedition rates. Based on these problems, conducted research to find solutions that can help people in the delivery of goods in the form of Android Pickaja application. Pickaja application developed is an intermediary service between shippers and the expedition. With GPS, Google Maps and Google Cloud Messaging are used to help exchange information and display notifications. GPS and Google Maps are used to determine pickup location, Pickaja looks for picker based on latitude and longitude and shows picker location. The evaluation was done by distributing questionnaires. Based on the results of these evaluations, it can be concluded that Pickaja designed to provide solutions to existing problems and meet user expectations. © 2017 IEEE.","Google Cloud Messaging; Google Maps; GPS; Pengiriman Barang","Contracts; Global positioning system; Information management; Ships; Surveys; Web services; Delivery of goods; Existing problems; Google Cloud Messaging; Google maps; Intermediary services; Pengiriman Barang; Shipping process; User expectations; Android (operating system)",,,,,"Kemp, S., (2017) Digital in 2017: Global Overview-We Are Social, , https://wearesocial.com/special-reports/digital-in-2017-global-overview, [Online], [Accessed: 06-Sep-2017]; Brähler, S., Analysis of the android architecture (2010) Os.Ibds.Kit.Edu, p. 52; Safaat, N.H., (2012) Pemrograman Aplikasi Mobile Smartphone Dan Tablet PC Berbasis Android, , Bandung: Penerbit Informatika; Koppers, J., (2015) Location Based Services: Positioning Techniques; Vanjire, S., Kanchan, U., Shitole, G., Patil, P., Location based services on smart phone through the android application (2014) Provider, 3 (1), pp. 4982-4987; Kushwaha, A., Kushwaha, V., Location based services using android mobile operating system.pdf (2011) Int.

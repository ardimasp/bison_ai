In this research, simulation is done to measure the delivery performance and all the processes included in delivery process. In fact, every process has their own risks could delay delivery process that the delivery performance is reduced. The methods used to identify the risks and the causes are Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). Risks analysis is done with the help of Pareto diagrams and scatter plot to determine the risks need to be corrected immediately. The proposed improvements are integrating the systems in form of e-cargo ready and implementing bar-coding. After the proposed e-cargo ready applied and being simulated, the delivery performance in terms of average total time reduced by 29,398%. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Delivery performance; FMEA; FTA; Simulation","Fault tree analysis; Risk analysis; Delivery performance; Delivery process; Failure mode and effects analysis; Fault tree analyses (FTA); FMEA; Improving delivery performance; Pareto diagrams; Simulation; Risk assessment",,,,,,"Afolayan, A., White, G.R., Mason-Jones, R., (2016) Why Knowledge Acquisition Is Important to Effective Supply Chain Management: The Role of Supply Chain Managers 'As Knowledge Acquisitors; Peng, D.X., Lu, G., Exploring the impact of delivery performance on customer transaction volume and unit price: Evidence from an assembly manufacturing supply chain (2017) Production and Operations Management, 26 (5), pp. 880-902; Mewborn, S., Murphy, J., Williams, G., (2014) Clearing the Roadblocks to Better B2B Pricing, 12; Ghadge, A., Fang, X., Dani, S., Antony, J., Supply chain risk assessment approach for process quality risks (2017) International Journal of Quality & Reliability Management, 34 (7), pp. 940-954; Ruijters, E., Stoelinga, M., Fault tree analysis: A survey of the state-of-the-art in modeling, analysis and tools (2015) Computer Science Review, 15-16, pp. 29-62; Ehsanifar, M., Hamta, N., Hemesy, M., A Simulation Approach to Evaluate Performance Indices of Fuzzy Exponential Queuing System (An M/M/C Model in a Banking Case Study) (2017) Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management, 4, pp. 35-51; Ramírez, C.S., López, D.R.M., Hernández, G.A., Alcaraz, J.L.G., Mendoza, D.A.T., Simulation software as a tool for supply chain analysis and improvement (2016) Computer Science and Information Systems, 13 (3), pp. 983-998; Shirani, M., Demichela, M., Integration of FMEA and human factor in the food chain risk assessment (2015) World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, International Journal of Social, Behavioral, Educational, Economic, Business and Industrial Engineering, 9, pp. 4247-4250; Held, M., Brönnimann, R., Safe cell, safe battery?

Industry 4.0 provides new opportunities to improve the resource and process efficiencies by combining information and communication technologies such as autonomous robots, internet of things, cloud computing, big data, augmented reality, additive manufacturing, etc. This integrated cyber-physical production system raise complexity within production system that implies new competencies required for industrial engineers which has been proven for years that the role of industrial engineer greatly influences a manufacturing industry's success by designing, implementing, improving and optimizing a complex processes of an integrated systems that consist of people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy and materials. The competencies required in Industry 4.0 could be categorized under technical competencies and social competencies. A learning factory with real world system is often used to train students a new set of competencies by hands-on and direct experiences. Therefore, a learning factory can make a substantial contribution to competencies enhancement for industrial engineering students. This paper presents a conceptual of Industry 4.0 Lab as a learning factory for industrial engineering education as an enabler of students' competencies in industry 4.0 era. A fully automated small production of filling bottle system integrating and demonstrating various Industry 4.0 concepts technologies is chosen.

All stakeholders need to prevent and control the environment not to be worse by design, produce and consume green products. Although the government and the companies already put their efforts to produce green products, the consumption behaviour needs to be changed to be greener. It is important to educate and raise awareness about climate change and green product consumption behaviour among youngster, especially undergraduate students because they are the ones who will determine the future of the earth. This study investigated green products consumption behaviour among Industrial Engineering undergraduate students who got courses related to the environment and green products based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). The survey is conducted to assess students' environmental knowledge, environmental ethics, environmental social responsibility, environmental self-responsibility, buying intention and consumption behaviour towards green products. The SEM-PLS technique is used to analyse the data and measure the direct effects between constructs. The survey is conducted from April to June 2018 using an online survey and was resulting 181 valid responses consisted of 55.80% male students and 44.20% female students with age range between 18 - 23 years old. The results revealed that there are significant positive influences between the environmental knowledge and behaviour dependent factors (environmental ethics, environmental social responsibility, and environmental self-responsibility). These factors have significant positive influences on buying intention and finally, the buying intention has a significant positive influence on consumption behaviour. The study concludes that the increase in environmental knowledge will bring to consumption behaviour towards green products. The findings of this study could contribute to the adaptation of behaviour change framework towards green products consumption, especially among youngster. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

A stochastic discrete-event simulation is developed using ARENA software to determine CU and capacity gap (CG) in short run production function. This study focused on machinery breakdown and product defective rate as random variables in the simulation. The study found that the manufacturing system run in 68.01% CU and 31.99% CG. It is revealed that machinery breakdown and product defective rate have a direct relationship with CU. By improving product defective rate into zero defect, manufacturing system can improve CU up to 73.56% and CG decrease to 26.44%. While improving machinery breakdown into zero breakdowns will improve CU up to 93.99% and the CG decrease to 6.01%. This study helps operation level to study CU using ""what-if"" analysis in order to meet future demand in more practical and easier method by using simulation approach. Further study is recommended by including other random variables that affect CU to make the simulation closer with the real-life situation for a better decision. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","capacity gap; capacity utilization; machinery breakdown; product defective rate; simulation","Computer software; Discrete event simulation; Machinery; Random variables; Stochastic systems; capacity gap; Capacity utilization; Defective rates; Machinery breakdown; simulation; Manufacture",,,,,,"Tamer, B.O.O., Information Acquisition for Capacity Planning via Pricing and Advance Selling: When to Stop and Act?

Spreadsheet simulation was used for that purpose considered spreadsheet is relatively not an expensive simulation software, familiar to many people, easy to use, yet powerful enough to do the simulation. Input data included in the simulation are time to repair and time between failures which are generated randomly following normal and uniform distribution respectively. The distribution identified by using the histogram and chi-squared test for distribution to find the best-fit distribution. The simulation results show that, the optimum number of personnel obtained when utilization of maintenance personnel is maximized while the number and/or time machines/equipment waiting in queued for maintenance personnel was minimized. In that condition, the cost of breakdown maintenance will be optimum. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",,"Maintenance; Optimization; Spreadsheets; Breakdown maintenance; Capacity requirement; Chi-Squared test; Maintenance personnel; Simulation software; Spreadsheet simulation; Time between failures; Uniform distribution; Computer software",,,,,,"Blischke, W.R., Murthy, D.P., Introduction and Overview (2003) Case Studies in Reliability and Maintenance, , in:, (John Wiley & Son, USA); Dhilon, B.S., (2002) Engineering Maintenance: A Modern Approach, , (CRC Press, Florida); Mobley, R.K., Introduction to the Theory and Practice of Maintenance (2008) Maintenance Engineering Handbook, , in:, 7 th ed, (McGraw-Hill, USA); Salonen, A., Deleryd, M., Cost of poor maintenance (2011) JQME, 17 (1), p. 63; Haroun, A.E., Duffuaa, S.O., Maintenance organization (2009) Handbook of Maintenance Management and Engineering, , in:, edited Ben-Daya et.

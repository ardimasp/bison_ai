Ethereum token (ERC-20) can tokenize any real-world object while it is also possible to exchange the token across the network participants. This utility from the token drives many blockchain enthusiasts to create decentralized applications. ERC-20 token could be used to collect project funds, decision voting, or even can be used to provide investment platforms for people that want to hedge the volatility of the currency with buying an asset that is back to back with the crypto-token. This research shows the main characteristics of asset-backed token and its implementation on a complete end-to-end “digitalization assets system” (assets buy and assets redemption). The result shows that asset-backed token needs support from government and other legalizing parties to verify the legitimacy of the asset that backing the token itself. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Asset-backed token; Blockchain; ERC-20; Ethereum; Token","Ethereum; Financial markets; Fintech; Commodity exchange; End to end; Real-world objects; Blockchain",,,,,"Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System; Konstantinidis, I., Siaminos, G., Timplalexis, C., Blockchain for business applications: a systematic literature review (2018) Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, pp. 384-399. , Springer International Publishing; Rosati, P., Čuk, T., (2019) Blockchain beyond cryptocurrencies.

In software development, artificial Intelligence offers a sophisticated enhancement on the programming logic, while blockchain technology provides transparency and relief the obligation to trust in a central party. Both are two different technologies but considered a disruptive technology in recent years. Artificial Intelligence faces several issues related to the validity of data, algorithms, and policies, while blockchain is called so 'friendly' with transparency, trust, and immutability. Both technologies are still in the early stages of their development age. Always, the opportunity for both technologies to converge in some ways would be an exciting area to be explored.

The requirements gathering is already done to identify and analyze the requirements of this project. The design process uses agile development methodology, whereas the testing process uses unit test and system integration test. The testing processes provide insight and understanding of system integration implementation process. The result of unit test and system integration test shows that the main business processes are fulfilled and accommodated successfully as the result of system integration. This system integration brought several benefits and value in the form of increased effectiveness in data exchange between systems in the business process cycle, accuracy on the exchanged data due to the occurring data validation done on the middleware level, and the efficiency of data exchange due to use of the developed web services that is integrated and supports real-time data update. © 2019 IEEE.","Agile Methodology; Enterprise Resource Planning; System Integration; System Integration Test; Terminal Operating System; Unit Test","Agile manufacturing systems; Electronic data interchange; Enterprise resource planning; Middleware; Ports and harbors; Real time systems; Resource allocation; Systems engineering; Testing; Web services; Agile development methodologies; Agile Methodologies; Enterprise resource planning systems; Implementation process; Integration process; Requirements gathering; System integration; Unit tests; Integration testing",,,,,"Kain, R., Verma, A., Logistics management in supply chain-An overview (2018) Mater.

Whereas, current awareness level of service quality for higher education management is quite lower than the enterprise management. In the daily operation of IT Service Management (ITSM) in Computer laboratory, service activities in computer laboratory mostly uncontrolled and not standardized. By maximizing the service standard level in computer laboratory, university could maintain customer satisfaction subsequently. This research will focus in creating an IT Service Model, Service Standard Process, and the web application by referring to ITIL-Incident Management Framework as a best practice of ITSM framework. The design process use UML diagram as the tools in drawing the process flow of system. © 2019 IEEE.","computer laboratory; IT service management; ITIL -incident management; UML","Customer satisfaction; Information management; Computer laboratory; Enterprise management; Higher education; Incident Management; IT service management; IT service management (ITSM); Service activities; Service standards; Laboratories",,,,,"Feisel, L.D., Rosa, A.J., The role of the laboratory in undergraduate engineering education (2005) J.

Although a number of organization prefer to use outsourcing and leasing services to manage the asset, but some organization prefer to buy their own and manage their assets. Currently maintaining asset is not an easy task, organization need to be considered about how to use the asset effectively. Information System can help the organization to manage assets, maintenance and repair of assets, calculate asset depreciation, and asset reallocation among divisions in organization. Information System as a media becomes very important to help the management of assets to be more coordinated. Laboratory ABC as part of the computer laboratory at university in Jakarta, is currently had many problems about asset management because there are a lot of devices to be maintained. The assets in computer laboratory are consists of hardware, software, and many other supporting devices. Based on these problems, the research is perform to analysis the process in asset management as well as to formulate and implement a framework of information system that suitable with the management of existing assets in laboratory ABC, so all data can be managed with the system. The method for this research is based on object-oriented analysis and design. The result of this research is an asset management system to support operational laboratory ABC process. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT & LLS.

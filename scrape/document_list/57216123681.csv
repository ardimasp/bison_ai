The brain tissue cannot function so the impact on a person is impaired physical and cognitive impairment. Post-stroke patient is advised to undergo therapy 1x24 hours after the patient is declared eligible for therapy. In this case, the organization of the therapy room can affect the quality of a rehabilitation building. The room becomes a supporting element to facilitate therapy activities. It was analyzed based on standards to achieve the room requirements to facilitate therapeutic activities needed by patients. To meet the needs of rehabilitation, the therapies that are recommended to undergo the rehabilitation process are occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech and visual, and hydrotherapy. The result in this study showed, to supporting physical therapy, post-stroke patients also need therapy to support cognitive function, by applying Therapeutic garden elements, it is expected to have influence in order to achieve maximum patient recovery process. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","rehabilitation; Stroke; therapeutic garden","Blood vessels; Brain; Patient rehabilitation; Physical therapy; Cognitive functions; Cognitive impairment; Post stroke patients; Post-stroke rehabilitation; Recovery process; Stroke; Therapeutic activity; therapeutic garden; Patient treatment",,,,,"(2018) Basic Health Research Riskesdes 2018, , Health research and development agency of the Ministry of Health Republic Indonesia; Barello, S., Graffigna, G., Menichetti, J., Sozzi, M., Savarese, M., (2016) The Value of A Therapeutic Gardening Intervention for Post-Stroke Patients' Engagement during Rehabilitation: An Exploratory Qualitative Study, , https://participatorymedicine.org/; Ahmet, T., Architecture Research: The Design Principles of Therapeutic Gardens (Online) (2017) International Journal of Landscape, 1; (2000) Health Building Note 8 Facilities for Rehabilitation Services Eds. 2000, , NHSEstate","Bobby Saragih, J.F.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: BSaragih@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

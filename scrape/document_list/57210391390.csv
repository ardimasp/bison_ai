For example, the electricity company in Indonesia, PT PLN, sees the high threat especially is fraud that involving information systems. The company, from 2015 to 2018, found many cases of fraud using information systems. PT PLN established an audit team to collect fraud’s digital evidence by implementing computer and mobile forensic that referring to the guidelines of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). The purpose of this study is to measure the comlience level of the audits that have been carried out with the ACPO guidelines. Forensic digital examination and analysis procedures must follow and refer to the basic principles or guidelines (guidelines) internationally, such as the Good Practice Guide issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) so that the examination output in the form of digital findings can be accepted as legal evidence at the trial. The study involves 113 digital evidence from the implementation of computers and mobile forensics at PT PLN. Surveys that refer to ACPO are used to measure complience level in handling 113 evidence with ACPO. The results showed that the average of complience has only reached 51%. In more detail, the proportion of evidence (in %) and the level of ACPO’s complience (in brackets and in %) are: 37 (57), 21 (48), 20 (52), 19 (43), and 2 (24). © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Association of Chief Police Officer; Computer Forensic; Digital evidence; Fraud; Mobile Forensic",,,,,,"(2012) Standar Internasional Praktik Profesional Audit Internal, , The Institute of Internal Auditors; Pln, P.T., Satuan Pengawasan Intern (2015) Standar Prosedur Audit Khusus, p. 135; Farjamfar, A., Abdullah, M.T., Mahmod, R., Udzir, N.I., A review on mobile device’s digital forensic process models (2014) Research Journal of Applied Sciences, Engineering and Technology, 8 (3), pp. 358-366. , https://doi.org/10.19026/rjaset.8.981; Manendra Sai, D., Prasad, G.K., R, N., Dekka, S., The Forensic Process Analysis of Mobile Device (2015) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technologies, 6 (5), pp. 4847-4850; Meiyanti, R., Perkembangan Digital Forensik (2015) Junal Kajian Ilmial UBJ, 15 (September 2015), pp. 1-7; Nuh Al-Azhar, M., (2012) Digital Forensics Practical Guidelines for Computer Investigation, , Salemba Infotek; Rahman, S., Khan, N.A., Digital Forensics through Application Behavior Analysis (2016) International Journal of Modern Education and Computer Science, 8 (6), pp. 50-56; Alanazi, F., Jones, A., Menon, C., Sharia Law and Digital Forensics in Saudi Arabia (2018) The Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law, 13 (3), pp. 5-19; Román, R.F.M., Mora, N.M.L., Vicuña, J.P.N., Orozco, J.I.P., Digital forensics tools (2016) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 11 (19), pp. 9754-9762; Umar, R., Riadi, I., Zamroni, G.M., Mobile Forensic Tools Evaluation for Digital Crime Investigation (2018) International Journal on Advance Science Engineering Information Technology, 8 (3), pp. 949-955",,,,"Little Lion Scientific",,,,,19928645,,,,"English","J.

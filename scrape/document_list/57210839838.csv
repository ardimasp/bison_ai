Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with WarpPLS Software 4.0 is used for data analysis. The most influential factor is knowledge sharing motivator. Knowledge sharing had the positive and significant effect on the performance of lecturers. It means that lecturers already conduct knowledge sharing to improve their research quality. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Knowledge sharing; Lecturer; Performance",,,,,"Binus University","This research was supported by Binus University.

This development triggers the appearance of change of an old system with a newly created system. One development that is trending is microcontroller technology which can now be used in all aspects of the environment. This development will create an automatic lamp prototype that can save electricity in a room, thereby reducing the waste of electricity usage from State Electricity Company (PLN). This prototype approach uses a human movement detection sensor with a Passive Infra-Red (PIR) sensor which is then integrated with the Arduino Uno microcontroller as the control center of the sensor. In addition to the PIR sensor, there is also a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensor or also commonly called a light sensor that functions as a determinant of the light intensity needed in the room, so that the use of controlled lights is in accordance with the intensity of the room's light. In addition, there is a GSM Sim 900A which is used as a notification in the event of a use of electricity outside the sensor controller. © 2020 IEEE.","Light dependent resistor (LDR); Microcontroller; On-off lamp; Passive infra-red (PIR)","Controllers; Electric power generation; Information management; Control center; Electricity companies; Electricity usage; Human movements; Light dependent resistor; Light intensity; Microcontroller technology; Science and Technology; Microcontrollers",,,,,"Kadir, A., (2018) Dasar Pemrograman Internet Untuk Proyek Berbasis Arduino, , Yogyakarta: Penerbit Andi; Kadir, A., (2018) From Zero to A Pro Arduino, , Yogyakarta: Penerbit Andi; Isfarizky, Z., Mufti, A., Rancang bangun sistem kontrol pemakaian listrik secara multi channel berbasis arduino (studi kasus kantor lbh banda aceh) (2017) Kitektro J.

As an insurance company, an agency of Commonwealth life agency will be aware of the knowledge for their company. Therefore the agency always pays attention to training and development of science from every agent. But unfortunately there are still some obstacles related to knowledge, such as the absence of good and integrated knowledge settings. That is almost personal knowledge and can't be shared. To maximize the use of knowledge, an Agency of Commonwealth life agency managerial initiative begins to build Knowledge Management. Sales cycle are used as an approach to build the knowledge center, to support the knowledge sharing culture. It is expected that with this knowledge management, existing knowledge in that Agency of Commonwealth life agency can become more organized, and can be utilized more leverage. In the end can help the development of the company.

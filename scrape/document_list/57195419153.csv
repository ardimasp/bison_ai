The data concealment is using the Multi Pixel Value Differencing (MPVD) algorithm, utilizing the difference from each pixel. The development was done by using six interval tables. The objective of this algorithm is to enhance the message capacity and to maintain the data security. © 2017 Author(s).","Interval; Multi Pixel Value Differencing; Steganography",,,,,,"Rainer, B., (2010) Advaced Statistical Steganalysis, , Springer; Wu, C.-C., Kao, S.-J., Hwang, M.-S., A High image sharing with steganography and adaptive authentication scheme (2011) The Journal of Systems and Software; Wang, C.-M., Chwei-Shyong Tsai, N.-I.-W., Hwang, M.-S., A High Quality Steganographic Method with pixel value differencing and modulus function (2008) The Jurnal of System and Software; Swain, G., Digital Image Steganography using Nine-Pixel Differencing and Modified LSB Substitution (2014) Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 7 (9), pp. 1444-1450; Gulve Avinash, K., Joshi, M.S., A Image Steganography Method with Five Pixel Pair Differencing and Modulus Function (2013) International Journal of Computer Applications; Chang, K.-C., Chang, C.-P., Huang, P.S., Tu, T.-M., A Novel Image Steganographic Method Using Tri-Way Pixel Value Differencing (2008) The Journal of Multimedia; Subhedra, M.S., Mankar, V.H., Current status and key issues in image steganography: A survey (2014) Computer Science Review, 13-14, pp. 95-113; Maleki, N., Jalali, M., Jahan, M.V., Adaptive and non-adaptive data hiding methods for grayscale images based on modulus function (2014) Egyptian Informatics Journal; Thiyagarajan, P., Aghila, G., Reversible dynamic secure steganography for medical image using graph coloring (2013) Health Policy and Technology; Karaklş, R., Güler, L., Çapraz, L., Bilir, E., A Novel Fuzzy Logic-Based Image Steganography Method to Ensure Medical Data Security (2015) Computers in Biology and Medicine; Shu-Yuan, S., Li-Hong, H., A data hiding scheme using pixel value differencing and improving exploiting modification directions (2014) Computer & Security; Shuliang, A Novel edge based image steganography with 2k correction and Huffman encoding (2015) Information Processing Letters; Kieu, T.D., Chang, C.-C., A steganographic scheme by fully exploiting modification directions (2011) Expert Systems with Applications; Zhao, W., Jie, Z., Xin, L., Qiaoyan, W., Data embedding based on pixel value differencing and modulus function using indeterminate equation (2015) The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications; Hong, W., Chen, T.-S., Luo, C.-W., Data embedding using pixel value differencing and diamond encoding with multiple-base notational system (2012) The Journal of System and Software; Wu, D.C., Tsai, W.H., A steganographic method for images by pixel-value differencing (2003) Pattern Recognition Letters, 24, pp. 1613-1626",,"Adzkiya D.","","American Institute of Physics Inc.","2nd International Conference on Mathematics - Pure, Applied and Computation: Empowering Engineering using Mathematics, ICoMPAC 2016","23 November 2016",,129657,0094243X,9780735415478,,,"English","AIP Conf.

Information technology provide many social media which is causing the leaked of personal information where abductor can find out the information. Using social media, people can share location, life event, and anything related about their life event, these become the useful information for the abductor. To anticipate this, a lot of personal tracking device is developed, but the response is too late. Because, the family or relative of the victims will notice that abduction had happen after the victim is lost. According to the problem, this research will focus on develop the personal tracking device which trigger by the victims who own the phone based on android and web application. Whenever the abduction happens, the victim just need to click the button and the system will send a message to the relatives and family in their contact also trigger the notification to the local security. Software development life cycle that will be used is scrum which is divided into several processes like backlog, sprints, scrum meetings, and demos. The result of this research is android application for user and web application for managing application. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Android application; Decision support system; Tracking application; Web application",,,,,,"Kinage, R., Kumari, J., Zalke, P., Kulkarni, M., Mobile Tracking Application (2013) International Journal of Innovative Research in Science, Engineering and Technology, 2 (3), pp. 617-623; Shirin, S., Dipina, D.B., Surekha, M.V., Mobile Tracker (2016) International Journal on Cybernetics and Informatics, 5 (2), pp. 213-219; Abhijeet, T., Ahemad, T., Ravindra, S., Pranay, D., Sumit, H., Mobile Tracking Application for Locating Friends using LBS (2013) International Journal of Innovative Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 1 (2), pp. 303-308; Abha, D., Hardik, S., Krishna, S., Global Positioning System for Object Tracking (2015) International of Computer Application, 109 (8), pp. 40-45; Pressman, R.S., Maxim, B.R., (2010) Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach, , Eighth Edition.

The main problems of IT project failure are scope, time, and cost. These three contains is affecting to each other. Time and cost are the impact of the changing in scope. About 50% - 80% of IT Projects are defined as failure project which is mostly caused by over time and over cost. In client side, the problems come from unrealistic expectations also misunderstanding in collecting requirements in order to develop a system. These problems are leading into many changes in system development and changes will leads into poor scope management. In this research, we will analyze the influence of poor scope management affecting the successful of IT Project. In this research, began by analyze the correlation between Unrealistic Expectation and Changes in Project. The second steps is to analyze the correlation between Changes in Project and Overtime and Overcost. The Third steps it to analyze the Failure Project which defined by acceptance status of client and its correlation with Overcost and Overtime. Statistic method used in this research is Chi-Square. The result shows a tight bond between Unrealistic Expectation to Project Failure. © 2016 IEEE.","Change Management; IT Failure; IT Project Management; Scope Management; Unrealistic Expectation","Information management; Project management; Change management; Information technology projects; It project managements; Project failures; Scope management; Statistic method; System development; Unrealistic Expectation; Costs",,,,,"Hussain, O., Direct cost of scope creep in govermental construction projects in Qatar (2012) Global Journal of Management and Business Research, 12 (14), pp. 73-84; Rajkumar, G., Alagarsamy, K., The most common factors for the failure of software development project (2013) The International Journal of Computer Science & Application, 1 (11), pp. 74-78; Abdelmoniem, E.M., Mazen, S.A., Hassanein, E.E., A framework for governance of post-construction activities in is development projects (2012) Case Study in Egyptian Environment, 9 (5), pp. 814-1694; Stelth, P., Le Roy, G., Projects' analysis through cpm (2009) School of Doctoral Studies Journal, 1 (1), pp. 10-51; Hori, S., Nakatani, T., Katamine, K., Ubayashi, N., Hashimoto, M., Project management patterns to prevent schedule delay caused byrequirements changes (2010) IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems, 93 (4), pp. 745-753; Al-Ahmad, W., Al-Fagih, K., Khanfar, K., Alsamara, K., Khalid, A.S., Abu-Salem, H., A Taxonomy of an IT Project Failure: Root Causes (2009) International Management Review, 5 (1), pp. 93-104; Kaitlynn, W.M., Charles, D.B., The root cause of failure in complex it projects: Complexity itself (2013) Procedia Computer Science, 20, pp. 325-330; Montequin, V.R., Cousillas, S., Ortega, F., Villanueva, J., Analysis of the success factors and failure causes in information & communication technology (ict) projects in Spain (2014) Procedia Technology, 16, pp. 992-999",,,"BINUS Univerity;IEEE Indonesia Section;Wiley","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2016","16 November 2016 through 18 November 2016",,127842,,9781509033522,,,"English","Proc.

The difference between this research application and others is the search feature based on an image. The search feature is designed to match the shape and orientation. This application uses a Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm to conduct the matching feature process. The SURF algorithm is divided into three main steps. The first step is to retrieve the image information and turn it into a matrix, using a Hessian - Laplace Technique to define the feature point following the integral to reduce the computational time. It also uses a Difference of Gaussian in order to handle the object with an invariant scale. This process is called Fast Hessian. The second step is to define the orientation of the image using a Haar Wavelet Responses Technique. The third step is to match the feature points from both images using a four dimensional vector and K-Means as a classification technique. The result of this research is an application which is able to collect plant information using image matching. © 2016 IEEE.","CBIR; encyclopedia; image matching; SURF","Information management; Web services; CBIR; Classification technique; Dimensional vectors; encyclopedia; Research applications; Speeded up robust features; SURF; Web-based applications; Image matching",,,,,"Connolly, T., Begg, C., Database systems: A practical approach to design, implementation, and management (6th edition) (2014) Pearson; Giri, A., Meena, Y.K., Review paper on content based image retrieval (2014) The International Journal of Science and Technoledge, pp. 125-129; Blanken, H., Vries, A., Blok, H., Feng, L., (2010) Multimedia Retrieval, , Amsterdam: Springer; Arthiabd, K., Vijayaraghavan, J., Content based image retrieval algorithm using colour models (2013) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 2 (3), pp. 1343-1347; Santos, L.F., Dias, R., Ribeiro, M., Traina, A., Combining diversity queries and visual mining to improve (2015) IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia, pp. 357-362; Meena, M., Ram Singh, A., Bharadi, A., Architecture for software as a service (saas) model of cbir on hybrid cloud of microsoft azure (2016) 7th International Conference on Communication, Computing and Virtualization 2016, pp. 569-578; Krajník, T., Cristóforis, P., Nitsche, M., Kusum, K., Image features and seasons revisited (2015) Mobile Robots (ECMR),2015 European Conference, pp. 1-7; Saad, M.H., Saleh, H., Konber, H., Ashour, M., CBIR system based on integration between surf and global features (2013) ICIT 2013 the 6th International Conference on Information Technology; Bay, H., Tuytelaars, T., Gool, L.C., SURF: Speeded up robust features (2008) Computer Vision and Image Understanding (CVIU), 110 (3), pp. 346-359; Guo, F., Luo, X., Liu, Y., Research on feature extraction and match method based on the surf algorithm for mobile augmented reality system (2015) International Industrial Informatics and Computer Engineering Conference, pp. 615-619; Schmitt, D., McCoy, N., (2011) Object Classification and Localization Using SURF Descriptors, , Citeseer; Lu, G., (1999) Multimedia Database Management Systems, , Norwood: Artech House",,,"BINUS Univerity;IEEE Indonesia Section;Wiley","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2016","16 November 2016 through 18 November 2016",,127842,,9781509033522,,,"English","Proc.

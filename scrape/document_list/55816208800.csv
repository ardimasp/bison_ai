This service combines financial services and mobile technology to serve consumers more effectively and efficiently relating to their needs of financial services. Its market size is also growing giving sign that the service is widely accepted. However, there is still a lack of study especially relating to consumer behavior in in adopting the service. Therefore, the aim of this research is to study what factors influence consumers in adopting FinTech services by surveying Indonesian consumers. From 250 respondents, there are 204 forms filled. By conducting Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using Lisrel 8.80 software, all consumer's inputs are computed. From this computation, there are three results that can be drawn. First, it revealed that trust has generally influenced not only user's satisfaction but also his continuance use intention, meanwhile, his satisfaction may not influence his continuance use intention. Second, all factors of convenience, performance, cost advantages, referent network size and perceived complementary are all together influencing user' satisfaction. Third, all factors of authentication, non-repudiation, confidentially, privacy protection, and data integrity are all together needed to be considered. Therefore, any Fintech companies are suggested to be aware of these matters to win their customers in this market. © 2020 IEEE.","Continuance use intention; Fintech; Lisrel; Satisfaction; Structural equation modeling; Trust","Commerce; Fintech; Information management; Privacy by design; Cost advantages; Financial service; Mobile Technology; Non repudiation; Privacy protection; Structural equation modeling; Use intentions; User's satisfaction; Consumer behavior",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

In order to achieve this objective, several previous studies have been reviewed in order to identify eight best practices of TQM implementation in healthcare industry such as Top Management and Commitment (TMC), Teamwork and Participation (TWP), Process Management (PM), Customer Focus and Satisfaction (CFS), Resource Management (RM), Organizational Behavior and Culture (OBC), Continuous Improvement (CI), Training and Education (TE). In turn, these best practices are modeled as conceptual model and tested in order to evaluate its fitness to healthcare industry in Indonesia. A SEM (Structural Equation Modeling)-LISREL software was used to serve this objective. After administering a purposive questionnaire to several related stakeholders of an Indonesian Hospital, the LISREL software was run to see whether the model is fit or not. As a result, because the p-value 0.23 is larger than required 0.05 then the model can be confirmed to be fit. © 2017 IEEE.","Healthcare; Hospital; LISREL; Structural Equation Modeling; Total Quality Management","Customer satisfaction; Health care; Hospitals; Human resource management; Continuous improvements; Healthcare industry; LISREL; Organizational behavior; Resource management; Structural equation modeling; Total quality managements (TQM); Training and education; Total quality management",,,,,,"Bina, L., (2016) Transition ISO 9001: 2008 to ISO 9001:2015, , http://www.slideshare.net/PECBCERTIFICATION/pecbwebinar-49304033, accessed June 13; (2016) RS Bina Husada Cibinong, , http://m.cekspot.com/RumahSakitBinaHusadaCibinong, Cekspot, accessed September 6; Chassin, M.R., Galvin, R.W., The urgent need to improve health care quality (1998) Journal of the American Medical Association, 280 (11), pp. 1000-1005; D'Souza, S.C., Sequeira, A.H., Application of mbnqa for service quality management in health care organizations (2011) International Journal of Engineering, Science and Technology, 3 (7), pp. 73-88; Dhae, A., (2015) Every Year, Six Hundred Thousand Indonesian People Having Medical Treatment Abroad, , http://rona.metrotvnews.com/read/2014/10/21/308075/tiaptahun-600-ribu-orang-Indonesia-berobat-ke-luar-negeri, Tiap Tahun, 600 Ribu Orang Indonesia Berobat ke Luar Negeri, accessed Oktober 16; Duggirala, M., Rajendran, C., Anantharaman, R.N., Patient-perceived dimensions of total quality service in healthcare (2008) Benchmarking: An International Journal, 15, pp. 560-583; Dunbar, N., (2016) The State We Are In: A (New), , http://www.slideshare.net/CharlesPerkinsCentre/nicoladunbar, National Approach to Health Literacy in Australia,m accessed June 20; Feigenbaum, A.V., (1991) Total Quality Control, , 3rd ed.

Based on previous researches, there are two health care models in the industry such as decease- and patient-centered care models. In their developments, the patient-centered care model is widely applied due to its capability in reducing cost and improving quality simultaneously. However, there is still no comprehensive model resulting in cost reduction, quality improvement, patient satisfaction and hospital profitability simultaneously. Therefore, this research is intended to develop that model. In doing so, first, a conceptual model using Kano's Model, Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is developed to generate several important elements of the model as required by stakeholders. Then, a case study of an Indonesian hospital is presented to evaluate the validity of the model using correlation analysis. As a result, it can be concluded that the model is validated implying several managerial insights among its elements such as l) leadership (r=0.85) and context of the organization (r=0.77) improve operations; 2) planning (r=0.96), support process (r=0.87) and continual improvement (r=0.95) also improve operations; 3) operations improve customer satisfaction (r=0.89) and financial performance (r=0.93) and 4) customer satisfaction improves the financial performance (0.98). © 2017 Author(s).",,,,,,,,"Bina, L., Transition ISO 900l: 2008 to ISO 900l:2015, , http://www.slideshare.net/PECBCERTIFICATION/pecb-webinar-49304033, accessed June 13, 2016; Cekspot, RS Bina Husada Cibinong, , http://m.cekspot.com/RumahSakitBinaHusadaCibinong, accessed September 6, 2016; Chassin, M.R., Galvin, R.W., The Urgent Need to Improve Health care Quality (1998) Journal of the American Medical Association, 280 (11), pp. 1000-1005; D'Souza, S.C., Sequeira, A.H., Application of MBNQA for Service Quality Management in Health Care Organizations (2011) International Journal of Engineering, Science and Technology, 3 (7), pp. 73-88; Dhae, A., Every Year, Six Hundred Thousand Indonesian People Having Medical Treatment Abroad (Tiap Tahun, 600 Ribu Orang Indonesia Berobat Ke Luar Negeri, , http://rona.metrotvnews.com/read/2014/10/21/308075/tiap-tahun-600-ribu-orang-Indonesia-berobat-ke-luar-negeri, accessed Oktober 16, 2015; Duggirala, M., Rajendran, C., Anantharaman, R.N., Patient-perceived Dimensions of Total Quality Service in Healthcare (2008) Benchmarking: An International Journal, 15, pp. 560-583; Dunbar, N., The State We Are In: A (New) National Approach to Health Literacy in Australia, , http://www.slideshare.net/CharlesPerkinsCentre/nicola-dunbar, accessed June 20, 2016; Feigenbaum, A.V., (1991) Total Quality Control, , 3rd ed.

This problem has triggered many complaints filed by patients. After deploying this tool, the team has come up with the fact that in processing the medicine, pharmacy unit does not have any storage and capsule packing tool and this condition has caused many wasting times in its process. Therefore, the team has proposed to the business leader to procure the required tools in order to shorten its process. This research has resulted in shortened lead time from 45 minutes to 30 minutes as required by the government through Indonesian health ministry with increased %VA (valued added activity) or Process Cycle Efficiency (PCE) from 66% to 68% (considered lean because it is upper than required 30%).

In order to serve these functions, the suspension needs several components to be assembled as a complete motorcycle unit. Before implementing QFDVA, the company had over budgeted several related components used to isolate the unit form noise, which is preceively top priority by customer, on IDR 217,569. After implementing QFDVA, the company has found that in order to isolate the unit form noise, it shall lower its budget on those related components to IDR 194,817 or about 12% from its original budget. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Quality function deployment and value added (QFDVA); Voice of customer",,,,,,,"(2012) Penjualan Motor Meningkat di Awal 2012, , http://oto.detik.com/read/2012/02/07/183049/1836681/1208/ penjualan-motor-meningkat-di-awal-2012, Published 7 Feb 2012.

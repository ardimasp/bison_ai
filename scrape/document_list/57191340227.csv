In industry with impacts on environment, supplier selection must even go beyond traditional criteria such as cost, delivery and quality. The study is a case study in a palm oil processor aiming to evaluate and shortlist its current suppliers. The research first analyzed comprehensive criteria sub-criteria to be used for the studied company, taking into account sustainability impact on palm oil processes. Twelve sub-criteria grouped into Cost, Quality, Delivery an Environment were recommended for the studied company. The research then evaluated five existing CPO suppliers of the studied company against the selected sub-criteria using combination of AHP and TOPSIS approach. Weight of criteria and sub-criteria was calculated using AHP, while supplier ranking was done using TOPSIS, to make sure the shortlisted supplier has closest distance from the best ones and farthest distance from the worse one. The results recommended the studied company to shortlist its supplier into top 3 suppliers. © 2020 IEEE.","Analytical hierarchical process; Supplier selection; TOPSIS","Costs; Decision making; Hierarchical systems; Information management; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Closest distance; Multi criteria decision making; Quality , Delivery; Strategic decisions; Supplier selection; Supplier selection process; Sustainability impacts; Palm oil",,,,,,"Palm oil (2017) Indonesia Investment, , https://www.indonesiainvestments.com/business/commodities/palm-oil/item166, I.

The research aims to analyze brand position of top six e-commerce platform (Tokopedia, Shopee, Bukalapak, Lazada, BliBli and JD.ID) within consumers in Two cities in Indonesia, Jakarta Tangerang. Products attributes were gathered through literature review and brainstorming. Factor analysis were then used to reduce consumers' attributes into 4 dimensions, i.e. E-commerce Capability, Customer Service, Value for Money, and Product Offering. Six perpetual maps were then created using Multi-dimensional scaling to analyze top six brands on those dimensions. Results shows that Tokopedia and Shopee are superior in E-commerce Capability, whilst sharing similar positioning in term of Value for Money and Product Offering. BliBli is perceived to be superior in Customer Service and can capitalize this dimension as their differentiation strategy. © 2020 IEEE.","Brand positioning; Factor analysis; Multidimensional scaling; Perpetual map","Electronic commerce; Information management; Multivariant analysis; Brand position; Customer services; Differentiation strategies; Integrating factor; Literature reviews; Multi-dimensional scaling; Product offerings; Value for monies; Factor analysis",,,,,,"Najafizadeh, N.S., Elahi, A.M., Moemeni, L.Z., A model for brand positioning of hygienic products using the most effective factors on competitive position and perceptual map technique (2012) African J.

With globalisation, this need become complex, overwhelming, yet necessary. This research was a case study in a medium size specialty-garment manufacturer in Bali, Indonesia. The studied company sells high quality sarong and beach wear to export markets. To improve their marketing and operation management toward their customers, this study helped to identify and quantify the customer attributes using combination of gap and Kano model. The result was then followed up by generating technical attributes and possible action plan using quality function deployment (QFD) methodology. The result showed top three customer attributes are 'on time delivery', 'reasonable price', and 'fast production lead time', and recommended to improve in 'post-manufacture quality inspection control', 'laundering control', 'dyeing and printing control', 'hiring more lease sewing operator', and 'periodical design update based on season'. The study was also able to apply systematic methodologies that can be applied even to a medium size firms for them to improve their management.

The research was a case study of a water park in east suburb of greater Jakarta area, Indonesia. The objective of the study was to help the studied company to identify what service attributes relevant for the water park and which ones are important to be improved. The study categorised service attributes using Kano model in order to capture possible nonlinear relationship between importance and satisfaction. The result was then analysed using SIPA grids by benchmarking its performance against two competitors. The result showed that currently there are only some 'keep alert attributes' and no 'key improving attributes'. However, after performing sensitivity analysis by slicing the data based on key respondents' demographic profiles, the SIPA-Kano analysis revealed some insights for possible improvement and recommendations.

The research is a case study of a shoe sole manufacturer in Indonesia sought to expand its business to international market. Seven potential countries were shortlisted, and 15 sub-criteria were identified for the export market selection of the studied company. The study employed combination of fuzzy AHP and PROMETHEE for its analysis. Fuzzy AHP was used to calculate weight of (sub)-criteria, whilst PROMETHEE was used for ranking the alternatives. Two scenarios were performed using different preference functions in PROMETHEE to gain insights and ensure stability of the recommendation. Using PROMETHEE’s stability interval, sensitivity analysis was also performed and recommended two stages of export plan. As the first stage it recommended three countries (Italy, China and Thailand) as the starting export countries for the studied company.

The basic and simple applications of D&SP are forecasting and aggregate planning which mainly used in big corporations, but less in small and medium enterprises. The research was a case study in a small firm in Indonesia, which started as small and family-owned company, but can enjoy the benefit of simple demand and supply planning to enhance its cost and productivity. Despite main application of D&SP in every production environment, no vast research has been done in the last couple of decades. The study and the case are thus, a refreshment on how application of D&SP still relevant. The case study examined seven common forecasting tools for demand planning side and exercised classical chase and level aggregate planning strategy for the supply planning side. It explored three possible scenarios and recommended a better scenario with 3% cost saving for the company.

Channel management and robust product distribution are important elements for confectionery business, since growth heavily depends on healthy product distribution. To support product distribution, optimising salesmen itinerary plays an important role in the firm's sales operation. The study was limited to optimising salesmen schedule for its wholesalers' outlet type, since it contributed to 78% of its revenue. The analyses were carried out using 'cluster first-route second' approach. For clustering the customer nodes, it recommended agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) method. For routing within each customer's cluster, it tested two algorithms, i.e., Clarke-Wright and weighted-serving time-visual approach. The result showed that AHC-weighted-serving-time-visual algorithm was as good as AHC-Clarke-Wright with 2.1% cheaper variable cost. The proposed algorithm was adapted from practical insight and easier to be understood.

Lean principles originated from manufacturing practice can be adapted to warehouse environment to enhance its productivity. The study was based on a multinational fast-moving consumer goods in Indonesia which relied on small and medium enterprises (SME) as their intermediaries to distribute its products throughout Indonesia. Lean warehousing techniques were used as a practical tool to introduce a good and efficient warehouse practice for its distributors. As a standardised framework for its distributors, the company introduced three stages for lean warehouse implementation, i.e., 'create stability', 'create flow', and 'make flow' in the warehouse. Implementation was done for the first two stages in one pilot distributor, resulting to 26% increase in picking productivity and a more balanced warehouse operation. Result will be used as a baseline and show-case for further implementations to the rest of its distributors.

Expanding business to an international market can give firms benefits such as economic of scale leading to cheaper cost, higher asset utilisation, as well as knowledge to international exposure. However, entering international market also poses its own challenges and risks. To make a sound business decision, firms wish to enter international market need to do a proper analysis and evaluation. The study is based on a case of a medium-size Indonesia company that wishes to export its metal-derivatives products to the international market. The study used a systematic international market selection (IMS) approach using a combination of analytical hierarchical process (AHP) and goal programming (GP). It chose 12 (sub) criteria, representing generic and product-related considerations. Based on the preliminary screening, it narrowed down the alternatives to 15 countries, and using the combination of AHP-GP recommended three countries to enter.

In supply chain management, where suppliers and customers involved, it is important to have a comprehensive and aligned performance measurement system. The study is based on a multinational pharmaceutical company in Indonesia. It aims to refine the performance measurement system (PMS) for its export department. The export activities involve multiple logistic service providers as their suppliers and several inter-market customers. The PMS is done based on balanced score card (BSC) concept. The study gives practical approach on implementation of PMS in middle and part of organisation, aligning its internal needs and external environment, without losing BSC integrity. A tracking tool is also developed to assist in measuring and monitoring the KPIs. © Copyright 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Balanced score card; BSC; KPI; Performance management system; Tracking tool",,,,,,,"Aitken, M., Machin, C., Troein, P., (2014) Understanding the Pharmaceutical Value Chain, , USA; Bhagwat, R., Sharma, M.K., Performance measurement of supply chain management: A balanced scorecard approach (2007) Computers and Industrial Engineering, 53 (1), pp. 43-62; Bulsara, H.P., Qureshi, M.N., Patel, H., Supply chain performance measurement - An exploratory study (2014) Int.

Decision on where and in which form a company should hold its inventory can give not only cost competitiveness but also responsiveness to customer requirement. This research is based on a case study of a multinational pharmaceutical company with international suppliers and a presence in several countries. The company has a few regional supply factories (affiliates or third parties), including one in Indonesia, serving its Asia-Pacific market. Pharmaceutical products involve many stock keeping units (SKUs) in different packaging formats even though they share the same ingredients. To enhance its supply network, the company is evaluating the option of a regional postponement centre which would serve as a consolidation and repacking facility to direct the demand of similar products from several markets to its supply nodes. This research project evaluates in which country the regional postponement facility should be best located. The research uses a combination of PESTLE-AHP-TOPSIS methodology. The criteria and sub-criteria are derived using PESTLE methodology, while the ranking and analysis is done using AHP-TOPSIS. The final result shows that Singapore is the most suitable location for the company’s regional postponement centre. © 2016, © 2016 International Management Institute, New Delhi.","AHP; multi-attribute decision making; PESTLE; regional postponement centre; TOPSIS",,,,,,,"Anand, K.S., Girotra, K., The strategic perils of delayed differentiation (2007) Management Science, 53 (5), pp. 697-712. , http://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0655, May,.

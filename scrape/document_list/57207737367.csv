The study is performed by analyzing journals and researches related to this topic, ranging from psychological to technological journals. A number of algorithms and techniques have been reviewed, and at the end of this paper, a summary of recommendation for performing facial emotion recognition based on the reviews of the techniques/methods is given. © 2018 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; computer vision; facial emotion recognition","Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Speech recognition; Face expressions; Facial emotions; Human emotion; Face recognition",,,,,"Chellapa, R., Sinha, P., Phillips, P.J., Face recognition by computers and humans (2010) Computer, pp. 46-55. , February; Rathore, N., Chaubey, D., Rajput, N., A survey on face detection and recognition (2013) International Journal of Computer Architecture and Mobility, 1 (5). , March; Jourabloo, A., Liu, X., Large-pose face alignment via CNN-based dense 3D model fitting (2016) The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 4188-4196. , June; Zhu, X., Lei, Z., Liu, X., Shi, H., Li, S.Z., Face alignment across large poses: A 3D solution (2016) The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 146-155. , June; Martinez, A., Du, S., A model of the perception of facial expressions of emotion by humans: Research overview and perspectives (2012) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 13, pp. 1589-1608. , May; Sinha, P., Balas, B., Ostrovsky, Y., Russell, R., Face Recognition by Humans: 20 Results All Computer Vision Researchers Should Know about; Moura, J.M., Ferreira-Lopes, P., Generative face from random data, on 'How computers imagine humans' (2017) Proceedings of ARTECH2017 8th International Conference on Digital Arts, , 6-8 September; Anderson, A.K., Phelps, E.A., Is the human amygdala critical for the subjective experience of emotion?

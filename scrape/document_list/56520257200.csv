We explored the issue of the identity of part-time academics in Indonesian higher education through interviews with 14 part-time and 11 full-time academics. Both groups identified more strongly with their teaching roles than with other roles. However, they differed in their perceptions of opportunities to enact their chosen academic roles and of the kind of academic development they needed. The current standardised model of academic development needs to be rethought to offer more flexibility and to invite departments’ participation in the development of their academics. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","academic development; Academic identity; identity theory; Indonesia; part-time academics",,,,,,"Aitken, A., Becoming an academic: Professional identity on the road to tenure (2010) The Journal of Educational Thought, 44 (1), pp. 55-68; Becher, T., Trowler, P., (2001) Academic tribes and territories, , 2nd, Maidenhead: Society for Research into Higher Education and Open University Press, &, ed; Berry, J., (2005) Reclaiming the ivory tower: Organizing adjuncts to change higher education, , New York, NY: Monthly Review Press; Boud, D., Walker, D., Promoting reflection in professional courses: The challenge of context (1998) Studies in Higher Education, 23 (2), pp. 191-206; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3 (2), pp. 77-101; Brenner, P.S., Serpe, R.T., Stryker, S., The causal ordering of prominence and salience in identity theory: An empirical examination (2014) Social Psychology Quarterly, 77 (3), pp. 231-252; Bryson, C., What about the workers?

This paper reports the findings from an Australian Alumni Reference Group activity which took place in Jakarta, Indonesia, in May 2013. An exploratory survey on plagiarism was conducted with Australian Award Alumni to capture their perceptions and opinions on the incidence of plagiarism and plagiarism prevention in higher education institutions in Indonesia. The survey was then followed up with a series of focus group discussions with representatives of higher education institutions to discuss the issues further. The findings revealed that a pattern of plagiarism conduct can be identified for both students and faculty members. One issue found is that there is a perceived discrepancy of standards between the overseas and local graduate faculty members on what plagiarism is. The overseas graduates are perceived as ‘stricter’, and this creates reluctance from the overseas faculty members to speak up on the issue for fear of being judged harshly. Concerns over standards and consistency, especially in law enforcement, were discussed in efforts to prevent plagiarism in higher education institutions in Indonesia. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Australian award alumni; Higher education Indonesia; Plagiarism",,,,,"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australian Government","Adiningrum, T.S., Kutieleh, S., How different are we?

The survey was conducted to 240 employees in nine departments in both hotels, using a questionnaire adapting JDI. Findings indicated that the highest influencing factors affecting employees’ turnover was the work environment, followed by pay, and opportunity for job promotion. There is no difference between employees in both hotels in their perception towards each of the variables; as well there is no difference between layers of management. The overall finding results can be used for the hotels to set the guidelines to improve the employees’ job satisfaction and reducing the turnover rate. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

This study uses quantitative data, using the fuzzy ahp model. The selection of criteria in this new decision-making system is carried out using FGD (Forum Group Discussion) by involving decision-makers within the IT department, to get the right criteria, and also using data from developer performance reports. so that the main criteria are right. The results obtained from the selection of developers using the Fuzzy AHP model show that criteria such as workload, speed, knowledge, and skills are the main criteria in selecting the right developer. The results of this study are developer alternatives that have been ranked based on the new method so that decision-makers can use the data as a basis for selecting developers to work on projects. Fuzzy AHP in the consistency level assessment is carried out at the hierarchical structure level and can accommodate inconsistencies in the assessment. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Weighbridge is an embedded system that is connected to the computer via the RS-232 port. Used to measure the weight of products like CPO (Crude Palm Oil), Kernel and Shell. Some problems caused by weighbridges system in Palm Oil Industry such as incorrect of Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) suppliers are often occurring, then incorrect selection of the FFB area, not saving weighing data, incorrect entry of the FFB sorting data, and incorrect selection of the sales contract. Therefore, the aim of the development is a more optimal system for solving these five problems and increasing the accuracy of the weighbridge. The research methodology used is the system development life cycle using a prototype model because it is more flexible and active, so that users can see, feel, and experience the development process, and repair errors relatively quickly. The results of the development of this system are systems designed to be more efficient by developing systems with application concepts that are connected to local network connections, so that one stage of the process can be combined with other processes and data can be interconnected between one process and another. © 2020 IEEE.","Arm gate; Barcode; Mobile application; Weighbridges","Information management; Life cycle; Palm oil; Sales; Development process; Local networks; Mobile application design; Plant productivity; Prototype models; Research methodologies; Sales contracts; System development life cycles; Petroleum industry",,,,,,"Boumans, G., (2012) Grain Handling and Storage, , Netherlands: Elsevier; Marshall, H., Murphy, G., Factors affecting the accuracy of weighbridge systems (2013) International Journal of the Forest Engineering, 14 (1), pp. 67-79; Sukimin, K., Perancangan sistem pnegolahan data timbang pabrik minyak kelapa sawit (cpo mill) dengan bahasa pemrograman visual basic 6. 0 pada pt. hindoli banyuasin palembang sematera selatan (2012) Expert-Jurnal Manajemen Sistem Informasi Dan Teknologi, 2 (2), pp. 54-61; Yu, L., Yongjun, L., Development and application of an efficient sugar refinery farm management information system (2012) Computer Science & Education (ICCSE 2012); Yang, L.Q., Wang, H., The analysis and design of weighbridge network monitoring system based on RFID (2012) Advanced Materials Research, 403, pp. 3153-3157; Pushparani, M., Sagaya, A., Towards aframework for embedded weight comparison algorithm with business intelligence in the plantation domain (2016) International Journal of Computer, Electrical, Automation, Control and Information Engineering, 10 (7), pp. 1376-1388; Kawaguchi, H., Wachi, T., Yagi, S., Weighbridge survey for freight policy analysis in the central Java region, Indonesia (2011) The 90th Annual Transportation Research Board Meeting; Kopczynski, T., Ness, D., Five factors that can affect your weighing system's accuracy (2001) Powder and Bulk Engineering, 15 (9), pp. 31-37; Kannan, P., Basaruddin, K.H., Monitoring and reporting of oil palm fresh fruit bunch (ffb) transactions among independent smallholders and dealers: An analysis of a case study in selangor, Malaysia (2017) Oil Palm Industry Economic Journal, 17, pp. 68-81",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","5th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2020","13 August 2020 through 14 August 2020",,163671,,9781728170718,,,"English","Proc.

However, to develop a face recognition-computing model is quite difficult, because the human face presents something complex, so to develop an ideal computing model for human face recognition is quite difficult. One of the best facial recognition methods is the Complete Kernel Fisher Discriminant (CKFD) method. The Complete Kernel Fisher Discriminant (CKFD) method has two advantages when compared to the previous Kernel Fisher Discriminant (KFD). First, the implementation of this algorithm can be divided into two phases, namely Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) plus Fisher Linear Discriminant analysis (FLD) so that the results are more transparent and simpler. Second, CKFD can make two categories of discriminate information so that the results are stronger. This research aims to produce an application with a face recognition algorithm with CKFD Method that is quite accurate. This research will produce a face recognition application with the CKFD method. The existence of this application is expected to help various parties who need a face recognition process. The CKFD method used can provide excellent facial recognition results when compared to other methods. The best result was given by using limit value with a False Acceptance Rate(FAR) value equal to 3.3 and a False Rejected Rate (FRR) value equal to 36.7. © 2020 IEEE.","Complete Kernel Fisher Discriminant; Facial Recognition; Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis; Kernel Principal Component Analysis","Discriminant analysis; Human computer interaction; Face recognition algorithms; Facial recognition; False acceptance rate; Fisher linear discriminant analysis; Human face recognition; Kernel Fisher discriminant; Kernel principal component analyses (KPCA); Recognition process; Face recognition",,,,,,"Sepritahara, S., (2013) Sistem Pengenalan Wajah (Face Recognition) Menggunakan Metode Hidden Markov Model, , Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta; Ely, K.D., Rancang bangun sistem pengenalan wajah menggunakan filter gabor (2012) Diponegoro, Semarang; Luo, D., Liu, A., Kernel fisher discriminant analysis based on a regularized method for multiclassification and application in lithological identification (2015) Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 16. , Sep; Mika, S., Ratsch, G., Weston, J., Scholkopf, B., Mullers, K.R., Fisher discriminant analysis with kernels (1999) Neural Networks for Signal Processing IX: Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE Signal Processing Society Workshop (Cat No. 98TH8468), pp. 41-48. , Aug; Smola, A.J., Schökopf, B., Sparse greedy matrix approximation for machine learning (2000) Proceedings of the Seventeenth International Conference on Machine Learning, San Francisco, CA, USA, pp. 911-918. , Jun Accessed: Jun. 29, 2020.

In general, research leads to a combination of pre-processing and training models. Therefore, this study aims to classify low-resolution face images using a combination of pre-processing and deep learning. In addition, this study also aims to compare evaluation results based on differences in epoch values. In this research will use the Trunk Branch Ensemble - Convolutional Neural Network (TBE-CNN) as one of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture combined with the pre-processing method which is super resolution to get better accuracy compared to the state-of -art. Then the model is trained with different epoch values, that is 40 and 100, to comparing the best classification. This study was evaluated by YTD Dataset. Based on the test results, this proposed method has achieved better results compared to the previous method, which gives an increase of 1%. After that, training results from different epoch values used produce different accuracy at the training model but have no effect on validation and testing model. The training using epoch = 100 has an accuracy increase of 3% compared to training using epoch = 40 and the loss ratio obtained at the training is decreased by 20% compared to training at epoch = 40. Furthermore, optimization parameters used and reducing computing time when training models and validation will be future research. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

By using it, they can communicate and understand each other. In Indonesia, there are two standards of sign language which are SIBI (Sistem Bahasa Isyarat) and BISINDO (Bahasa Isyarat Indonesia). Deep learning is a model that is used to apply to this topic. In this model, there are a lot of methods such as convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, long-sort term memory, and each model has its characteristics. There are also some issues in deep learning by sign language recognition as the object such as data training, object position, pose, lighting, and the background of objects. This research will describe how to combine background subtraction and gaussian blur pre-processing, forwarding preprocessing background subtraction with CNN by using BISINDO, LSTM, and a combination between CNN and LSTM.

It means practically 'working together' without considering their dissimilarities and disparities to solve a problem. Specifically in public facility construction, at some time the citizen have to work together to do so with their own capital and resources through donation activity. It occurs century by century. Based on that unique phenomenon, this paper proposes a decision support model (DSM) that fundamentally created based on the GORO spirit to reconstruct the damage. The model is able to suggest the most objective damaged public facility that should be rehabilitated first. The method fuzzy logic is the main method operated in this work. The object-oriented method was used to design and develop a model. The simulated-annealing was functioned as an optimization method to optimize a selected decision. Finally, the model was tested by using experimental data to see its running. © 2019 IEEE.","decision support model; fuzzy logic; gotong royong; public facility","Computer circuits; Decision support systems; Simulated annealing; Decision support models; gotong royong; Indonesia; Object oriented method; Optimization method; Public facilities; Fuzzy logic",,,,,,"Rahayu, S., Ludigdo, U., Irianto, G., Nurkholis, Budgeting of school operational assistance fund based on the value of gotong royong (2015) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 211, pp. 364-369; Kertawibawa, B.B., Harun, I.B., Migration and changing desa-kota interaction (2012) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 50, pp. 55-68; Herliana, E.T., Preserving javanese culture through retail activities in pasar beringharjo, yogyakarta (2015) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 184, pp. 206-213; Bowen, J.R., On the political construction of tradition: Gotong royong in indonesia (1986) The Journal of Asian Studies, 45 (3), pp. 545-561; Alaceva, C., Rusu, L., Barriers in achieving business/it alignment in a large swedish company: What we have learned (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, 51 (B), pp. 715-728; Rienties, B., Tempelaar, D., Bossche, P.V.D., Gijselaers Dan, W., Segers, M., The role of academic motivation in computer-supported collaborative learning (2009) Computers in Human Behavior, 25 (6), pp. 1195-1206; Derks, D., Bos, A.E., Grumbkow, J.V., Emoticons and social interaction on the internet: The importance of social context (2007) Computers in Human Behavior, 23 (1), pp. 842-849; Zadeh, L.A., Fuzzy logic = computing with words (1996) IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 4 (2), pp. 103-111; Kirkpatrick, S., Gelat, C.D., Vecchi, M.P., Optimization by simulated annealing (1983) Science, 220 (4598), pp. 671-680; Erný, V., Thermodynamical approach to the traveling salesman problem: An efficient simulation algorithm (1985) Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications, 45 (1), pp. 41-51; Utama, D.N., (2015) The Optimization of the 3-d Structure of Plants, Using Functional-Structural Plant Models.

Determination of the coordinates of the center point (centroid) is generally done by generating random numbers and each instance will then be placed based on proximity to random numbers generated. Determining a good centroid will prevent the occurrence of local optima problems in K-Means. The GenClust++ algorithm is a pretty good algorithm in determining centroid. However, what needs to be considered is the influence of the selection and crossover process on the performance of clustering. This study will discuss the combination of selection and crossover processes that are good in the process of determining the centroid. Performance measurement method will be based on the measurement of Mean Square Error and distance calculation using Euclidean Distance. The results show that the Roulette Wheel Selection and Whole Arithmetic Crossover selection processes will give the best performance for the GenClust++ Algorithm. © 2019 IEEE.","centroid; crossover; GenClust++; K-means; selection","Mean square error; Random number generation; centroid; crossover; GenClust; K-means; selection; K-means clustering",,,,,,"Islam, M.Z., Estivill-Castro, V., Rahman, M.A., Bossomaier, T., Combining k-means and a genetic algorithm through a novel arrangement of genetic operators for high quality clustering (2018) Expert Systems with Applications, 91, pp. 402-417; Lloyd, S., Least squares quantization in pcm (1982) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 28 (2), pp. 129-137; Wu, X., Kumar, V., Quinlan, J.R., Ghosh, J., Yang, Q., Motoda, H., McLachlan, G.J., Steinberg, D., Top 10 algorithms in data mining (2008) Knowledge and Information Systems, 14 (1), pp. 1-37; Maitra, R., Peterson, A.D., Ghosh, A.P., (2010) A Systematic Evaluation of Different Methods for Initializing the K-Means Clustering Algorithm; Maulik, U., Bandyopadhyay, S., Genetic algorithm-based clustering technique (2000) Pattern Recognition, 33 (9), pp. 1455-1465; Rahman, M.A., Islam, M.Z., Crudaw: A novel fuzzy technique for clustering records following user defined attribute weights (2012) Tenth Australasian Data Mining Conference; Zahra, S., Ghazanfar, M.A., Khalid, A., Azam, M.A., Naeem, U., Prugel-Bennett, A., Novel centroid selection approaches for kmeans-clustering based recommender systems (2015) Information Sciences, 320, pp. 156-189; Liu, Y., Wu, X., Shen, Y., Automatic clustering using genetic algorithms (2011) Applied Mathematics and Computation, 218 (4), pp. 1267-1279; Rahman, M.A., Islam, M.Z., A hybrid clustering technique combining a novel genetic algorithm with k-means (2014) Knowledge-Based Systems, 71, pp. 345-365; Beg, A.H., Islam, M.Z., Estivill-Castro, V., Genetic algorithm with healthy population and multiple streams sharing information for clustering (2016) Knowledge-Based Systems, 114, pp. 61-78; Muzid, S., Dinamisasi parameter algoritma genetika menggunakan population resizing on fitness improvement fuzzy evolutionary algorithm (profifea) (2014) Seminar Nasional Teknologi Dan Informatika; He, S., Dai, Y., Zhou, R., Zhao, S., A clustering routing protocol for energy balance of wsn based on genetic clustering algorithm (2012) IERI Procedia, 2, pp. 788-793; Cowgill, M.C., Harvey, R.J., Watson, L.T., A genetic algorithm approach to cluster analysis (1999) Computers & Mathematics with Applications, 37 (7), pp. 99-108; Meng, Y., Liang, J., Cao, F., He, Y., A new distance with derivative information for functional k-means clustering algorithm (2018) Information Sciences, 463-464, pp. 166-185; Ongko, H.E., Abdullah, D., Determining a cluster centroid of k-means clustering using genetic algorithm (2015) International Journal of Computer Science and Software Engineering, 4 (6), pp. 160-164; (2018) Machine Learning Repository, , https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php, UCI [online] Available: [Accessed 6 September",,"Supangkat S.H.Sembiring J.Arman A.A.Nugraha IGB.B.Bandung Y.",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","10th International Conference on ICT for Smart Society, ICISS 2019","19 November 2019 through 20 November 2019",,157204,,9781728148809,,,"English","Proceeding - Int.

Computer technology used in teaching and learning can help improve children's preferences and abilities to learn mathematics in class, and can change attitudes of early childhood who are more critical, creative, and innovative. Jarimagic method is one method for learning to count on the fingers, where early childhood often communicate with fingers in learning mathematics in the classroom. For this reason, research attempts learning methods with interactive games with hand movements using the Jarimajic method and tools scratch 2.0. In this study, evaluation of data obtained through 20 child respondents was carried out by testing before using the game and after using the game, using Pre-Test and Post-Test analysis, which was divided into 2 results based on the preferences and abilities of early childhood learning mathematics in the classroom. From the study, the game development was carried out using the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) method by taking the model of implementation the waterfall model. then a game is designed to overcome this problem. After the game is made, the game will be tested again for early childhood, with T-Test statistical analysis as the final data obtained from research that shows whether early childhood likes and increases ability to learn mathematics after the game is implemented.

Currently the mobile application gets data from the ERP system by importing and exporting it so that the data used is not real-time. To support the creation of real-time data communication between ERP systems and mobile applications, a replacement method for the export and import process is needed. Therefore, this study makes several web services that can be used to replace the export and import processes through the integration of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) with mobile applications using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Web services are made using RESTful and have passed several stages of testing using the QOS standard. Based on the results of testing using Jmeter with a simulation of 20 users obtained latency on the web service is 3 seconds and 4 seconds load time with an average data size of 2599 bytes so it can be concluded that this quality is quite good in terms of performance and accessibility. Test results using vooky show no bugs, but there are still shortcomings in security, which are caused by the lack of security in the header. With the results of these tests, the webservice can be used to replace the export and import process that have been used by the salesperson, so the data communication between ERP and mobile applications becomes real-time. © 2019 IEEE.","ERP; RESTful; SOA; WEB SERVICE","Convolutional codes; Enterprise resource planning; Information management; Information services; Mobile computing; Real time systems; Web services; Websites; Data-communication; Enterprise resource planning (ERP); Import process; Mobile applications; Multi-national companies; Real-time data communication; Replacement methods; RESTful; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,,"Monk, E.F., Wagner, B.J., (2009) Concept in Enterprise Resource Planning, Course Tecnology Cengage Learning; Holmberg, N., Johansson, B., De Carvalho, R.A., How to gain synchronization between business processes and enterprise resource planning systems: A soa based perspective on erp implementation (2013) Researchgate; Holmberg, N., Johansson, B., (2017) A Service Oriented Perspective of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems, 8 (2); Rathod, D., Registry for restful web service: Restregistry (2017) International Journal of Research GRANTHAALAYAH, 5 (7), pp. 128-135; Beltrána, J.V.E., Iglesiasb, V.G., Fernándezb, D.R., Enabling distributed manufacturing resources through SOA: The REST approach (2017) Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 46, pp. 156-165; Navdeep, D., Parmar, N., Soa and rest synergistic approach (2014) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technologies, 5 (6), pp. 7045-7049; Wagh, K.D., Thool, R.D., A comparative study of soap vs rest web services provisioning techniques for mobile host (2015) Journal of Information Engineering and Applications, 2 (5), pp. 2224-5782; (2000) E.

However, to improve users' motivation, learning tool must be appealing. Researches have introduced the concept of gamification to make learning more entertaining. The primary purpose of this research is to understand how the proposed gamification elements using Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics (MDA) framework improve users' motivation and learning outcomes in English learning. For this research, we use six to eleven framework defining six aspects of emotion and eleven aspects of instinct. We collected users' scores then analyzed them by using a t-test. We also used a questionnaire to access the users' experience. The results suggest that most of the respondents are motivated to learn more deeply. We conclude that the proposed gamification elements improve users' motivation and learning outcomes. © 2019 IEEE.","6-11 Framework; English Language; Game; Game-based learning; MDA Framework","Motivation; 6-11 Framework; English languages; Game; Game-based Learning; MDA Framework; Data communication systems",,,,,,"Deterding, S., Dixon, D., Khaled, R., Nacke, L.E., Gamification toward a definition (2011) Proceedings Ofthe 2011 Annual Conf Erence on Human Factors in Computing System; Johnson, L., Adams Becker, S., Estrada, V., Freeman, A., (2014) NMC Horizon Report: 2014 Higher Education Edition, , Texas: The New Media Consortium; Kim, S., Song, K., Lockee, B., Burton, J., (2017) Gamification in Learn Ing and Education: Enjoy Learning like Gaming, , Switzerland: Springer; Kapp, K.M., (2013) The Gamification OfLearning and Instruction Fieldbook: Ideas into Practice, , San Francisco: John Wiley & Sons; Pickard, T., (2017) 5 Statistics That Prove Gamification Is the Future Ofthe Workplace, , https://www.business.com!articles/5-statistics-that-prove-gamification-is-the-future-of-theworkplace/; Adams, E., (2010) Fundamentals of Game Design, , (2nd ed.), California: Pearson Education, Inc; Gilbert, S., (2016) Designing Gamified Systems, , Oxon: Focal Press; Zichermann Dan, G., Cunningham, C., (2011) Gamification by Design, , Sebastopol: O'Reilly; Hunicke, R., LeBlanc, M., Dan Zubek, R.M., (2004) MDA: A Formal Approach to Game Design and Game Research; Dillon, R., The 6-11 Framework: A new methodology for game analysis and design (2011) Proceedings Game-On Asia Conference, pp. 25-29; Su Dan, C.-H., Cheng, C.-H., A mobile gamification learning system for improving the learning motivation and achievements (2015) Journal Oj Computer Assisted Learning., pp. 268-286; Sari, B.W., Utami, E., Fatta, H.A., Penerapan konsep gamification pada pembelajaran tenses bahasa inggris berbasis web (2015) Jurnal Ilmiah SISFOTENIKA., 5, pp. 155-166; Lam, S.L., (2014) Use of Gamification in Vocabulary Learning: A Case Study in Macau; Garland, C.M., (2015) Gamification and Implications for Second Language Education: A Meta Analysis; Nedeva, V., Dimova, E., (2010) Some Advantages of C-Leaming in English Language Training; Faya Cerqueiro, F., Chao Castro, M., (2015) Board-games As Review Lessons in English Language Teaching: Useful Resources for Any Level; Ketyi, A., (2016) From Mobile Language Learning to Gamification: An Overlook of Research Results with Business Management Students over A Five-Year Period; Strmecki, D., Bernik, A., Radosevic, D., (2016) Gamific Ation in E-Learning: Introducing Gamified Design Elements into E-Learning Systems; Grina Myhre, M., (2015) Gamification in Mobile Language Learning: Improving User Satisfaction for Norwegian Immigrants; Gafui, R., Biran Achituv, D., Joyce Rachmani, G., (2017) Learning Foreign Languages Using Mobile Applications; Cheong, C., Cheong, F., Filippou, J., (2013) Quick Quiz: A Gamified Approa Ch Fo R Enchancing Learning; Osipov, L.V., Volinsky, A.A., Nikulchev, E., Prasikova, A.Y., (2015) Study of Gamification Effectiveness in Online E-Learning Systems",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","12th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology and Systems, ICTS 2019","18 July 2019",,152286,,9781728121338,,,"English","Proc.

The proposed method to modify ANFIS with Fuzzy C-Means Clustering (FCM) approach is applied to detect four typical kinds of faults that may happen in the e-banking system, which are application response times, transaction per second, server utilization and network performance. Input data is obtained from the e-banking monitoring results throughout 2017 that become data training and data testing.

Especially along with the great development of Deep Learning. Video-based Sign Language Recognition is our concern because we want to recognize a sign not only by the shape but also by the action the signer does. The problem is sign language is very complex and vary. The variation of sign language is making the system harder to recognize all the words accurately. Many researchers have been researching Sign Language Recognition for a long time. So many methods had been used to find out which one is the best method. Because of similarity between Sign Language Recognition and Action Recognition, we are trying to implement one of the top-tier models in Action Recognition which is i3d inception this model is also a new Action Recognition model with very high accuracy. So we can know is it possible to adopt Action Recognition behavior into Sign Language Recognition. The goal of this paper is to implement the i3d inception model to Sign Language Recognition with transfer learning method. From the test we've been done, we got 100% accuracy on training with 10 words and 10 signers with 100 classes but the validation accuracy is pretty low. This model is too overfit. © 2018 IEEE.","comparation; convolutional neural network; deep learning; recognition; sign language","Behavioral research; Convolution; Deep learning; Neural networks; Action recognition; comparation; Convolutional neural network; High-accuracy; recognition; Sign language; Sign Language recognition; Transfer learning methods; Pattern recognition",,,,,"This research was supported by Research Grant No. 036/CR.RTT/IV/2018from Ministry of Research Technology and Higher Education of Republic of Indonesia.","(2018) Deaf Cambridge Dictionary, , https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/deaf, Retrieved from Cambridge Dictionary; Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L., Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database (2009) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009.

Visual-based gesture recognition can help to overcome this communication limitation. Recently, several techniques and methods have been proposed in this area of research and showed some improvements. Despite all of the proposed methods, most of hand gesture recognition approaches that have been applied still lack of compatibility and have lots of limitations. For instance, hand segmentation meets the complication of distinguishing the hand and the face region by using skin detection. Motivated by those facts, this paper presents a review and explains progress of feature extraction in sign language recognition mostly in the last ten years. In this contribution, we focus on studying feature extraction methods. The literature used in this study is based on the previous published international papers which discussed sign language recognition. The main objectives from this review are to get the most effective and most compatible feature extraction method to be applied to sign language recognition system and to further research progress in the future. After reviewing various recognition techniques, we can conclude that the current works have successfully improve hand gesture recognition by inventing a technology which helps for tracking hands region precisely by using an active sensor. However, there is still room for improvements based on a markerless passive sensor, such as vision-based approaches. © 2018 IEEE.","feature extraction; gesture recognition; pre-processing method; sign language recognition","Extraction;

While face attractiveness classification seems to be related to personal preference, building a robust attractiveness classifier is not impossible. There are several studies that have developed a classification system of facial attractiveness using a convolutional neural network and provide satisfactory results. The use of Image-net pre-trained convolutional neural network has been largely used by face-related research, yet none of them are related to facial attractiveness. This study aims to compare the famous deep learning architecture, such as VGG, Inception, and ResNet models. This research also aims to analyze the effect of using the Viola-Jones algorithm, as a preprocessing method, to the classification result of the built model. Viola-Jones algorithm will detect faces in image data, and 2 types of cropping will be done to extract the face region from the image, namely loose-crop and tight-crop. This research produces the highest accuracy value of 82.52% by using ResNet50 model and loose-crop preprocessing method. © 2018 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Face Recognition; Facial Attractiveness","Classification (of information); Convolution; Crops; Data mining; Face recognition; Grading; Neural networks; Classification results; Classification system; Convolutional neural network; Facial attractiveness; Learning architectures; Personal preferences; Pre-processing method; Viola - Jones algorithms; Deep learning",,,,,,"Talamas, S.N., Mavor, K.I., Perrett, D.I., Blinded by beauty: Attractiveness bias and accurate perceptions of academic performance (2016) PLoS One, 11 (2); Foo, Y.Z., Simmons, L.W., Rhodes, G., Predictors of facial attractiveness and health in humans (2017) Sci.

While it is popular, most people don't know how to use it. The problem lies in the difficulty of how many signs there to be memorized. That's why Sign Language Recognition (SLR) is needed. Sign Language Recognition (SLR) is a very interesting area for some researcher because of the complexity of its problem especially using video-based recognition of complex sign language. That's why Sign Language Recognition (SLR) has been developed for a long time. Unfortunately, every research about Sign Language Recognition has its own limitation. Some research got low accuracy, too expensive, insufficient dataset, and many other else. Every researcher also has their own way of doing a thing but usually, the pattern in Sign Language Recognition (SLR) are dataset collection, preprocessing data, feature extraction, training, and classification. For the dataset, we will use Argentina Sign Language that provides data as video. After that, we need to preprocess it using edge detection and skin detection using the help of Contrast Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for image enhancement. Then we will extract its feature by its movement. At last, we will train and classify the data using some modified Hidden Markov Model. In this research, we get an accuracy of 83% by classifying 10 signs using Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (Gaussian HMM) and 72% by classifying 10 signs using Multinomial Hidden Markov Model (Multinomial HMM). © 2018 IEEE.","comparation; hidden markov model; machine learning; recognition; sign language","Classification (of information); Edge detection; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Object recognition; Technology transfer; Trellis codes; Adaptive histogram equalization; Communication techniques; comparation; Gaussian-HMM; recognition; Sign language; Sign Language recognition; Skin Detection; Hidden Markov models",,,,,,"Suharjito, A.R., Wiryana, F., Ariesta, M.C., Kusuma, G.P., Sign language recognition application systems for deaf-mute people: A review based on input-process-output (2017) 2nd International Conference on Computer Science and Computational Intelligence; Wang, H., Chai, X., Zhou, Y., Fast, C.X., (2015) Sign Language Recognition Benefited from Low Rank Approximation; Shaik, K.B., Ganesan, P., Kalist, V., Sathish, B.S., Jenitha, J.M.M., Comparative study of skin color detection and segmentation in HSV and YCbCr color space (2015) 3rd International Conference on Recent Trends in Computing; Kumar, P., Gauba, H., Roy, P.P., Dogra, D.P., Coupled HMM-based multi-sensor data fusion for sign language recognition (2016) Pattern Recognition Letters.; Raheja, J.L., Minhas, M., Prashanth, D., Shah, T., Chaudhary, A., Robust genture recognition using kinect: A comparison between DTW and HMM (2015) Elsevier; Li, T.H.S., Kao, M.C., Kuo, P.H., (2015) Recognition System for Home-Service-Related Sign Language Using Entropy-Based K-Means Algorithm and ABC-Based HMM; Yadar, G., Maheshwari, S., Agarwal, A., (2014) Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equilization Based Enchancement for Real Time Video System; Fatmi, R., Rashad, S., Integlia, R., Hutchison, G., (2017) American Sign Language Recognition Using Hidden Markov Models and Wearable Motion Sensors; Rautaray, S.S., Agrawal, A., Vision based hand gesture recognition for human computer interaction: A survey (2015) Artificial Intelligence Review, 43 (1), pp. 1-54; Tharwat, A., Gaber, T., Hassanien, A.E., Shahin, M.K., Refaat, B., Sift-based Arabic sign language recognition system (2015) Afro-european Conference for Industrial Advancement, pp. 359-370. , Springer, Cham; Fok, K.Y., Ganganath, N., Cheng, C.T., Chi, K.T., A real-time asl recognition system using leap motion sensors (2015) Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery (CyberC), 2015 International Conference on, pp. 411-414. , IEEE; Savur, C., Sahin, F., Real-time American sign language recognition system using surface emg signal (2015) Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA), 2015 IEEE 14th International Conference on, pp. 497-502. , IEEE; Lee, G.C., Yeh, F.H., Hsiao, Y.H., Kinect-based Taiwanese sign-language recognition system (2016) Multimedia Tools and Applications, 75 (1), pp. 261-279; Zhang, J., Zhou, W., Xie, C., Pu, J., Li, H., Chinese sign language recognition with adaptive HMM (2016) Multimedia and Expo (ICME), 2016 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 1-6. , IEEE; Wu, J., Sun, L., Jafari, R., A wearable system for recognizing American sign language in real-time using IMU and surface EMG sensors (2016) IEEE J.

In this research, we propose sentence-level SLR using deep learning method by combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-RNN). Specifically, 3D CNN is implemented to extract features from each video frame and bidirectional-RNN is implemented to extract the unique features from the video frame's sequential behavior, which later generate a possible sentence. There are two key takeaways from this paper. The first is our proposed dataset of Indonesian Sign Language (SIBI) which is comprised of 30 sentences in SIBI. The second is our novel approach of using deep learning and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function in sentence-level SLR. The result shows that the hyperparameter used, in this case Hyperparameter 1, achieves the best result. Also, this research found that deeper network does not necessarily guarantee good results. A bigger number of dataset also affects the performance of the system. © 2018 IEEE.","CNN; CTC loss; deep learning; RNN; SIBI; sign language recognition","Bismuth compounds; Convolution; Deep learning;

Some predictions are made only by using historical currency data to be predicted, this makes predictions less accurate because they do not consider external influences. This study examines external factors that can influence the results of predictions, by looking for the relationship between the value of indices such as NTFSE and S & P 500 and the value of commodities such as gold and silver to the prediction process of EUR / USD. Prediction carried out using a deep learning algorithm with the Convolutional Neural Network method uses 4 1-dimensional convolution layers with ReLu activation. The data used is the value of Open, High, Low and Close prices on forex, indices and commodities which are combined into one with the close forex value target for the next 1 days. Testing of EUR / USD test data gets MSE results of 0.00009984. While the results of testing of the combined test data between EUR / USD, indices and commodities producing MSE vary between 0.0000589 to 0.000137 where the best combination is a combination of FTSE 100 and Natural Gas values. So, it can be concluded that other factors included in predicting have an influence on the results obtained. Copyright © 2020 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Because freelancers can work anywhere and anytime without being bound by a contract with a company or person. But freelancers have difficulty managing their tasks and projects because there is no system to monitor and manage the project. Therefore, the solution is to make the project freelancer monitoring system by implementing the MVC (Model View Controller) architecture model with the PHP Laravel and Slim framework. MVC design patterns are well-known patterns and are used for interactive software system architectures. The way the MVC method works is to separate the main components such as data manipulation (model), display/interface (View) and the process (Controller) so that it is more neat, structured and easily developed. The purpose of this study also compares the MVC Laravel and Slim framework architecture with a performance comparison method on load/stress testing on the dashboard page using Apache JMeter tools with 3 scenarios from samples 1, 100, and 500. Tests are done offline and report format results of performance tests is a Summary Report.

Many system changes are proposed from within the application structure, data structure and computing structure to adjust with fluctuation of mobile network connectivity, diversity between a plethora of modern devices, and the development of application programming paradigm. There have been many mobile and cloud offloading schemas that have been proposed on the last couple of years, each with their own objective in mind. When addressing proof of location in web application, the current approach of using server-client architecture has problems in scalability. Server can only handle limited computations concurrently, and when addressing the problem of scalability, a good approach is to use decentralized system. This paper is proposing a decentralized approach using reverse offloading architecture to address proof of location as an alternative to global positioning system in web application. The development method for our decentralized web-app is using WebAssembly, and our scalability performance is evaluated using docker swarm simulation test, and our proposed reverse offloading architecture shows better performance in network throughput and computing resources.

Revenue in the mining industry from year to year has continued to decline, and this has an impact on large companies that have an impact on the company's performance and profits. Through this problem the researcher aims to propose a prediction model in the mining industry using deep learning (DL), which has not been widely applied in financial revenue especially in the mining sector. This study uses a model of neural network LSTM learning approaches. The implementation of financial revenue prediction is done by comparing the LSTM model with an ARIMA. Data obtained for the last 6 years 2012-2017 from data set of mining industry processed by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources and the World Bank. The evaluation model is compared between LSTM and ARIMA used by root mean squared error (RMSE). In the ARIMA prediction with model (5, 1, 0) a ratio of 0.1 coefficients and a standard error below 1, p value below 0, this indicates that the LSTM model has better accuracy compared to ARIMA with an average error of 0.24 on revenue indicators and 0.32 on the price indicator commodity.

The equation is solved numerically by using finite difference methods with Forward Time Backward Space approach. The model is simulated by using python-based desktop application to show the flow characteristics. Computational results are displayed in the form of summaries, tables, two-dimensional graphics, and three-dimensional graphics. Validation is done by comparing computational results data with data from the other studies that have been done before and concluded that the simulation results have been valid and indicate compliance with the prior studies.

P2p lending has gained significant momentum recently, with some platform has reached billion-dollar loan circulation. However, p2p lending platforms are not free from any form of risks. A higher return on investment for investor comes with a risk of the loan and interest not being repaid. For this purpose, this research proposes a tree-based classification method for predicting whether a loan will go bad or default before the loan is approved. The high dimensionality of the dataset needs to be processed and chosen carefully. This paper proposes a Binary PSO with SVM to perform feature selection for the dataset and Extremely Randomized Tree (ERT) and Random Forest (RF) as the classifiers. In this research, BPSOSVM-ERT and BPSOSVM-RF are compared with several performance metrics. The experimental results show BPSOSVM can produce subset of features without decreasing the performance from the original features and ERT can outperform RF in several performance metrics. © 2019 The Authors.

This case study discusses how to convalesce IT services using the information technology infrastructure library (ITIL) framework and measure service level management (SLM) using Fuzzy ITIL (FITIL) approach. This paper aims to obtain an appropriate model for the measurement of IT service management by using fuzzy approach. Besides that, this paper aims to be able to provide an improving recommendations and IT governance based on current value (as is) and expected value (to be). The research method functioned is by measuring maturity level using best practice of ITIL v3 to condition before and after of improving process based on a questionnaire that has been performed. After obtaining the value of the maturity level for each cycle within ITIL, then the value will be created as an input for FITIL. The manufacture of FITIL is done in 4 stages, namely fuzzification, knowledge base, inference, and defuzzification. The results of the conditions before and after of the improving process have been successful in increasing the level of maturity in each ITIL cycle. The case study indicates an improvement in the increased level of maturity in SLM with FITIL approach. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Large amount of medical data of DM patients is available and it provides significant advantage for researchers to fight against DM. The main objective of this research is to leverage F-Score Feature Selection and Fuzzy Support Vector Machine in classifying and detecting DM. Feature selection is used to identify the valuable features in dataset. SVM is then used to train the dataset to generate the fuzzy rules and Fuzzy inference process is finally used to classify the output. The aforementioned methodology is applied to the Pima Indian Diabetes (PID) dataset. The results show a promising accuracy of 89.02% in predicting patients with DM. Additionally, the approach taken provides an optimized count of Fuzzy rules while still maintaining sufficient accuracy. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

But not all of them are a healthy company that has a good financial condition. One of the methods to assess bank's financial performance is by using financial ratio analysis. To analyze all BPR financial condition using financial ratio analysis will require so many time and effort. That's why Business Intelligence is needed to provide a fast and reliable information for top management in Bank Andara to help them make decisions regarding their potential customer's financial condition.

Thus, the right way to answer the issues is incredibly crucial to be proposed. This study aims to design an application to determine the sub-criteria weight with Fuzzy-AHP method, select the best supplier via Fuzzy-TOPSIS method, and calculate the allocation of quota to each supplier thru Fuzzy-MOLP method. The study was conducted on high class store by taking the object of material gymnastic product (spandex). Simulation confidently demonstrates that the Fuzzy-AHP approach is able to be operated to generate parameter Quality Product as the best sub-criteria (with value 0.221), the Fuzzy-TOPSIS technique can be used to ring out the supplier (where CV.

This research proposes a model of effort estimation for web-based mobile application developed using object oriented approach. In the proposed model, functional size measurement of object oriented based web application named OOmFPWeb, web metric and mobile characteristic for web-based mobile application size measurement are combnined. The estimation process is done by using mamdani fuzzy logic method. To evaluate the proposed model, the comparison between OOmFPWeb as the variable that affect effort estimation for web-based mobile application and the proposed model are performed. The evaluation result shows that effort estimation for web-based mobile application with the proposed model is better than just using OOmFPWeb. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Functional; Fuzzy logic; Hypermedia; Mobile application effort estimation",,,,,,,"Rao, D.M., (2012) Mobile Southeast Asia Report, , Mobile Monday; Schwalbe, K., Information Technology: Project Management (2010) Course Technology, pp. 8-9. , 6th Edition ed., C Learning, Ed., Boston; Mendes, E.N., Mosley, S.C., Investigating Early Web Size Measures for Web Cost Estimation (2003) Procedings of the EASE' 2003 Conference, pp. 1-22; Abrahao, S., Poels, G., A Family of Experiment to Evaluate a Fuctional Size Measurement Procedure for Web Applications (2009) Journal of Systems and Software, 82 (2), pp. 253-269; Souza, L.S., Aquino, G.S., Jr., Estimating the Effort of Mobile Application Development (2014) CS & IT, pp. 45-63; Shepperd, M., Schofield, C., Kitchenham, B., Effort Estimation Using Analogy (1996) Proceeding of ICSE-18; Myrtveit, I., Stensrud, E., A Controller Experiment to Assess the Benefits of Estimating with Analogy and Regression Model (1999) IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering, 25 (4), pp. 510-525; Shepperd, M.J., Schofield, C., Estimating Software Project Effort Using Analogies (1997) IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering, 23 (11), pp. 736-743; Suharjito, S., Jimmy, J., Girsang, A.S., Mobile Decision Support System to Determine Toddler's Nutrition Using Fuzzy Sugeno (2017) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE), 7 (6), pp. 3683-3691; Lubis, A.J., Susanto, E., Sunarya, U., Implementation of Maximum Power Point Tracking on Photovoltaic Using Fuzzy Logic Algorithm (2015) TELKOMNIKA (Telecommunication Computing Electronics and Control), 13 (1), pp. 32-40; Sharma, V., Verma, H.K., Optimized Fuzzy Logic Based Framework for Effort Estimation in Software Development (2010) IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science, 7 (2), pp. 30-38; Kumar, N.V.R.S., Mandala, A., Chaitanya, M.V., Prasad, G., Fuzzy Logic for Software Effort Estimation Using Polynomial Regression as Firing Interval (2011) IJCTA, pp. 1843-1847; Prasad, P.R., Sudha, K.R., Rama, P.R., Application of Fuzzy Logic Approach to Software Effort Estimation (2011) IJACSA International Journal of Advance Computer Science and Application, 2 (5), pp. 87-92; Malathi, S., Sridhar, D.S., Optimization of Fuzzy Analogy in Software Cost Estimation Using Lingustic Variables (2012) Procedia Engineering, 32, pp. 177-190; Ziauddin, S., Kamal, S., Khan, J.A.N., A Fuzzy Logic Based Software Cost Estimation Model (2013) International Journal of Software Engineering and Its Application, 7, pp. 7-18; Suharjito, S., Nanda, B.S., Modeling software effort estimation using hybrid PSO-ANFIS (2016) Int.

Sign Language Recognition (SLR) system, which is required to recognize sign languages, has been widely studied for years. The studies are based on various input sensors, gesture segmentation, extraction of features and classification methods. This paper aims to analyze and compare the methods employed in the SLR systems, classifications methods that have been used, and suggests the most promising method for future research. Due to recent advancement in classification methods, many of the recent proposed works mainly contribute on the classification methods, such as hybrid method and Deep Learning. This paper focuses on the classification methods used in prior Sign Language Recognition system. Based on our review, HMM-based approaches have been explored extensively in prior research, including its modifications. Deep Learning such as Convolutional Neural Network is popular in the past five years. Hybrid CNN-HMM and fully Deep Learning approaches have shown promising results and offer opportunities for further exploration. However, overfitting and high computational requirements still hinder their adoption. We believe the future direction of the research is toward developing a simpler network that can achieve high performance and requires low computational load, which embeds the feature learner into the classifier in multi-layered neural network fashion. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Classification methods; Hidden Markov model; Neural networks; Sign language recognition",,,,,,"This research was supported by Research Grant No. 039A/VR.RTT/VI/2017 from Ministry of Research Technology and Higher Education of Republic of Indonesia.","Adithya, V., Vinod, P.R., Gopalakrishnan, U., Artificial neural network based method for Indian sign language recognition (2013) 2013 IEEE Conference on Information & Communication Technologies (ICT), pp. 1080-1085. , Thuckalay, Tamil Nadu, India; Ahuja, M.K., Singh, A., A Survey of Hand Gesture Recognition (2015) International Journal, 3 (5), pp. 266-271; Apoorva Ranjini, S.S., Chaitra, M., Deepika, V., Patil, J.M., Sign Language Recognition System (2014) International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication, 2 (4), pp. 947-953; Assael, Y.M., Shillingford, B., Whiteson, S., de Freitas, N., (2016) Lipnet: Sentence-Level Lipreading.

The shape of a roof is a very influential factor shaping a sense of comfort in the house. Henceforth, everyone will have to sort different forms in choosing the proper roof model that makes them feel comfortable. This research developed a mathematical modeling of the temperature distribution of a room that is influenced by the shape of the roof. This research uses different types of roof to be studied, namely, a rectangular house with a straight, triangular, convex and concave roof. Room temperature distribution is analogous to the concept of thermal fluid dynamics equations. Solution heat equation was solved numerically through explicit finite difference method. However, due to the random observation domain, this study uses ghost-point method. This method uses the quadratic extrapolation approach. The development of mathematical models in the program was compiled using python language, so that the program can represent the temperature of the room at any point well. This research shows that a house which with straight roof is the most efficient in terms of heat distribution.

The secret message could not be revealed unless the recipients exchange and collect shares to reconstruct the actual message. Even though the attacker obtain shares shadow during the share exchange, it would be impossible for the attacker to understand the correct share. There are few algorithms have been developed for secret sharing, e.g. secret splitting, Asmuth-Bloom secret sharing protocol, visual cryptography, etc. There is an unanswered question in this research about which method provides best level of security and efficiency in securing message. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of three methods, i.e. secret splitting, secret sharing, and recursive threshold visual cryptography for handwritten image security in terms of execution time and mean squared error (MSE) simulation. Simulation results show the secret splitting algorithm produces the shortest time of execution. On the other hand, the MSE simulation result that the three methods can reconstruct the original image very well. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Secret sharing; Splitting; Visual cryptography",,,,,,,"Pakshwar, R., Trivedi, V.K., Richhariya, V., A Survey on Different Image Encryption and Decryption Techniques (2013) Int J Comput Sci Inf Technol, 4 (1), pp. 113-116; Sharma, A., Srivastava, D.K., A Comprehensive View on Encryption Techniques of Visual Cryptography (2014) Int J Recent Res Rev, 7 (2); Deng, H., Song, X., Chaos-Based Image Encryption Algorithm Using Decomposition (2014) Indones J Electr Eng Comput Sci, 12 (1), pp. 575-583; Yong-Jun, G., Li-Zheng, G., Ming-Hui, Z., Improved Multi-secret Sharing Scheme Based on One-Way Function (2014) Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (IJEECS), 12 (6), pp. 4463-4467; Anbarasi, L.J., Mala, G.S.A., Prassana, D.R.L., Visual Secret Sharing of Color Image Using Extended Asmuth Bloom Technique (2015) Computational Intelligence in Data Mining-, 3, pp. 555-562. , Springer; Yan, X., Lu, Y., Liu, L., Wan, S., Ding, W., Liu, H., Chinese Remainder Theorem-Based Secret Image Sharing for (k, n) Threshold (2017) International Conference on Cloud Computing and Security, pp. 433-440; Farras, O., Padró, C., Xing, C., Yang, A., Natural generalizations of threshold secret sharing (2014) IEEE Trans Inf Theory, 60 (3), pp. 652-664; Kumar, S., Sharma, R.K., Recursive information hiding of secrets by random grids (2013) Cryptologia, 37 (2), pp. 154-161; Parakh, A., Kak, S., Internet voting protocol based on improved implicit security (2010) Cryptologia, 34 (3), pp. 258-268; Hwang, S.J., Sung, Y.H., Chi, J.F., Deniable authentication protocols with confidentiality and anonymous fair protections (2013) Advances in Intelligent Systems and Applications, 2, pp. 41-51. , Springer; Husain, A.K., Rahman, A.A.R.A., A New Scheme for Pseudo Random Numbers Generator Based on Secret Splitting (2015) Int J Soft Comput Eng (IJSCE), pp. 2231-2307; Muhammad, Y.I., Kaiiali, M., Habbal, A., Wazan, A.S., Sani Ilyasu, A., A secure data outsourcing scheme based on Asmuth-Bloom secret sharing (2016) Enterp Inf Syst, 10 (9), pp. 1001-1023; Harn, L., Fuyou, M., Chang, C.-C., Verifiable secret sharing based on the Chinese remainder theorem (2014) Secur Commun Networks, 7 (6), pp. 950-957; Rathore, A.K., Jain, A., A Review on Various Implemented Techniques for Visual Cryptography (2016) Int J Comput Appl, 155 (5); Yan, X., Wang, S., Niu, X., Yang, C.-N., Generalized random grids-based threshold visual cryptography with meaningful shares (2015) Signal Processing, 109, pp. 317-333; Lecun, Y., MNIST handwritten digit database, Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes and Chris Burges, , http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, [Internet].

For examples, 'Rumah Joglo' from Java, 'Rumah Gadang' from West Sumatra, 'Rumah Tongkonan' from South Celebes, and many more. Analysis of temperature distribution for certain traditional houses with different roof shapes in Indonesia are presented in this paper. It seems interesting to analyzed since the roof of traditional houses apparently adapted in home architecture nowadays. Temperature distribution represented by steady state heat equation and solved by numerical method using finite difference method. Quadratic extrapolation toward ghost point method is also used here to accommodate the arbitrary domain problem. Temperature distributions will simulate some house with different shapes of roof and compare it.

However, selecting the required disaster recovery model based on functionality or usability, and the financial budget in manufacturing industry is not easy. It requires a method that can be used for technology selection. Top management has options for making decisions based on subjective assessments to select the appropriate disaster recovery model. An information systems typically support decision making process by offering the best alternative solutions. Multi Criteria Decision Making approach using Analytic Hierarchy Process method is proposed to support the decision support system.Results of this study are to provide a model of disaster recovery that can be chosen appropriately in accordance with desired criteria. © 2018 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.","Analytical hierarchy process; Disaster recovery; Multi criteria decision making",,,,,,,"Afif, M.F., Suryono, T., Implementasi Disaster Recovery Plan dengan sistem Fail Over menggunakan drbd dan Heartbeat pada data center fkip uns (2013) Ijns-Indonesian J.

This research aims to develop a human anatomy learning system using augmented reality technology. By using this system, it is expected that students can easily understand the anatomy of the human body using a 3D image visualization. The method used in this system is augmented reality marker on mobile computing platform. The marker is captured by taking a picture. Then, the captured image is divided into pieces and the pattern is matched with images stored in the database. In this research, we use Floating Euphoria Framework and combine it with the SQLite database. Augmented reality anatomy system of the human body has features that can interactively display the whole body or parts of the human organs. To evaluate the usefulness of the application, we tested the augmented reality anatomy system with high school students and medical students for learning the anatomy of the human body. The results show that the human anatomy learning system with interactive augmented reality visualization helps students learn human anatomy more easily. © 2018 The Authors.

Little's Law formula in Queue Theory provides a generic formula for waiting-time, but it cannot be implemented directly to give finite wait-time estimation in real-life. This study aims to investigate predictive variables that explain waiting-time duration. This paper uses Fast Artificial Neural Network engine to implement Artificial Neural Networks method. To train Artificial Neural Networks, Resilient Propagation was used. Time-series approach and structural approach for input neuron was compared. Average duration from previous interval and number of server was proposed to increase structural variable like Queue Length and Head of Line Duration estimator variable. To determine the best configuration for number of neuron in input and hidden layer, experimental method was used. The results of this study show that structural approach provides better estimation than time-series approach. Furthermore, modified helper variable combination provides a more refined result. © 2018 The Authors.

This makes business reporting less efficient and overwhelms query processing results in data warehouses so that they do not meet business requirements. The fast and complex evolution of the digital world must be scalable to the data warehouse process, so that the authors implement it in the data warehouse using massive parallel processing (MPP) with the Greenplum database, so that business users can get reports faster and more optimally. This case study explains how the MPP system implements and measures the performance of the Greenplum database by performing complex queries in the data warehouse with parallel processing. Therefore, this case study analyzes whether the use of MPP systems can measure the scalability of throughput and the response time in the data warehouse so that system performance in the Greenplum database remains stable for daily, weekly, and monthly operations. © 2018 The Authors.

Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) is a popular approach and the most widely used in CBIR problem. In this research, a CBIR method using BoVW and multiclass SVM classifier will be proposed. In BoVW, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) will be used as the local features descriptor. This research will use Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as the method to do the visual vocabulary generation and Fisher Vector (FV) to create the encoder. The multiclass SVM classifier will use linear kernel, Hellinger’s kernel, and chi-square kernel to do the classification. After the classification, the proposed CBIR will use the classification model to classify query image. After the query image class is known, then the color histogram features will be extracted from query image and dataset which only consists of image in the same class as query image. Datasets used in the research are Corel and Guang-Hai Liu (GHIM-10K). The experimental results show that BoVW with GMM and FV produces higher accuracy than other encoding methods in BoVW which produce a good retrieval result in the CBIR. © 2017.","Bag of visual words; Content based image retrieval; Image classification",,,,,"Binus University","Acknowledgment.

This study aims to look at the accuracy of Geometric Moment invariant (GMI) and Zernike Moment invariant (ZMI) with Self-Organizing Maps to recognize human ears. This study used data from ear AMI database, consisting of 125 ears from 25 different people, in which each person has 5 images of the right ear. In this study, each image of the ear is modified with a different rotation angle. The accuracy of ear image recognition using GMI is 75.20% while using ZMI is 66%. The accuracy of using Geometric Moment Invariant is higher by 9.2% because Geometric Moment Invariant does not change the result of the image to be recognized due to translation, scaling, reflection and rotation.GMI cannot recognize the image of the ear with an average of 24.80% while the ZMI cannot recognize the image of the ear with an average of 34.40%. From the test results, at a rotation angle of 30 ° CCW, the geometric moment method has the best accuracy, while the Zernike moment method has the best accuracy at 30 ° CW.

Compression in the storage or file-systems layer has not been widely adopted for OLTP database because of the concern that it might decrease database performance. OLTP compression in the database layer is available commercially but it has a significant licence cost that reduces the cost saving of compression. In this research, transparent file-system compression with LZ4, LZJB and ZLE algorithm have been tested to improve performance of OLTP application. Using Swing-bench as the benchmark tool and Oracle database 12c, The result indicated that on OLTP workload, LZJB was the most optimal compression algorithm with performance improvement up to 49% and consistent reduction of maximum response time and CPU utilisation overhead, while LZ4 was the compression with the highest compression ratio and ZLE was the compression with the lowest CPU utilisation overhead. In terms of compression ratio, LZ4 can deliver the highest compression ratio which is 5.32, followed by LZJB, 4.92; and ZLE, 1.76. Furthermore, it is found that there is indeed a risk of reduced performance and/or an increase of maximum response time. © 2017 Penerbit UTM Press.

To achieve an accurate estimate some algorithmic estimation techniques proposed to eliminate or reduce inaccuracies estimation. COCOMO is a parametric model used to estimate software effort. However, so far no model has proven successful to effectively and consistently predict software effort. Parametric models are considered vulnerable when faced with the problem of non-linearity of the complex in the parameters. In recent years, some estimation technique appears using intelligent systems to predict software effort. This study uses a model Neuro-fuzzy optimized with PSO to get the right model to improve the estimation effort at NASA dataset software project. Parameter cost driver, consisting of 17 feature COCOMO will then be optimized using PSO techniques to get a better prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the results of the optimization will be trained in using the algorithm to get a prediction Neuro-fuzzy effort. The performance of the proposed estimation model will be evaluated with some other intelligent system model parameters to evaluate several criteria such as Mean Standard Error (MSE), Mean Magnitude of Relative Error (MMER), and Level Prediction (Pred). The model that best shows the error rate MSE and MMER lowest to highest Pred. © 2016 IEEE.","ANFIS; COCOMO; Effort Estimation; Particle Swarm Optimization","Budget control; Errors; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Intelligent systems; NASA; Project management; Software design; Traffic signals; ANFIS; COCOMO; Effort Estimation; Estimation techniques; Mean magnitude of relative errors; Parametric modeling; Project management process; Project planning and control; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",,,,,,"Grimstad, S., Jorgensen, M., The impact of irrelevant information on estimates of software development effort (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 Australian Software Engineering Conference, ASWEC '07 IEEE Computer Society, pp. 359-368; (2001), http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~gmp/docs/papers/extreme_chaos2001.pdf, [Online]. http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~gmp/docs/papers/extreme-chaos2001.pdf; Douglas Fisher, F., Srinivasan, Krishnamoorthy, Machine learning approaches to estimating software development effort (1995) IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 21 (2), pp. 126-137; Prabhakar, Dutta, M., Application of machine learning techniques for predicting software effort (2013) Elixir Comp.

Wavelet fusion is one of the pan-sharpening methods which combines the higher spatial resolution panchromatic image with the lower resolution multispectral image to create high resolution fused image. Data fusion using multispectral and high spatial resolution panchromatic images are useful for improving classification accuracy. The study area of our research is Bodetabek (Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi) area, Indonesia. Different wavelet bases (Haar, Db2 to Db6, Coif1 to Coif5, and Sym1 to Sym5) were examined to determine the best basis for the data fusion process. This study also examined the effect of wavelet decomposition level to the spatial and spectral quality of the fused image. The experimental results on LANDSAT data show that the best basis for wavelet fusion is Coif5. The classification accuracy assessment on different wavelet decomposition level fused image also demonstrates that the higher wavelet decomposition, the higher spatial quality of the fused image. Although the spectral quality was degraded as the wavelet decomposition level increased, the classification accuracy assessment results show that higher wavelet decomposition level yields better overall classification accuracy (96.28% for eight decomposition level vs 82.77% for two decomposition level). © 2017 Global IT Research Institute - GiRI.","Land cover classification; LANDSAT; Pan-sharpening; Wavelet fusion","Image enhancement; Image fusion; Image resolution; Classification accuracy; Classification accuracy assessments; High spatial resolution; High-resolution fused images; Land cover classification; LANDSAT; Pan-sharpening; Wavelet fusion; Wavelet decomposition",,,,,,"Vivone, G., Alparone, L., Chanussot, J., Dalla Mura, M., Garzelli, A., Licciardi, G.A., Restaino, R., Wald, L., A critical comparison of pansharpening algorithms (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, pp. 191-194. , Quebec City, QC, Canada, 13-18 July; Gharbia, R., Azar, A., Baz, A., Hassanien, A., (2014) Image Fusion Techniques in Remote Sensing, , arXiv Prepr. arXiv ..; Landsat 7 science data users handbook landsat 7 science data users handbook (1972) Science (80-. )., p. 186. , Nasa; Lu, D., Weng, Q., Urban classification using full spectral information of landsat etm imagery in marion county, Indiana (2005) Photogramm.

To reduce the impact of reproductive disease, it is necessary to perform detection and early treatment to prevent significant losses and a wider spread of the disease. This article explains the application of an expert system that provides a means of consultation imitating the reasoning process of an expert in solving complex problems concerning the health of cows reproduction. We will apply Fuzzy Tsukamoto method to help diagnose the level of risk of disease in cattle based on six clinical symptoms. The result of this research is a mobile expert system that will conclude the level of risk of endometritis disease in cattle. This mobile application is developed based on android, for ease of use, and can be used by farmers in making the diagnosis by themselves. The validation results of this expert system show that the system is able to determine the level of risk of endometritis for cow's reproduction disease. © 2017 The Authors.

Unfortunately, every research has its own limitations and are still unable to be used commercially. Some of the researches have known to be successful for recognizing sign language, but require an expensive cost to be commercialized. Nowadays, researchers have gotten more attention for developing Sign Language Recognition that can be used commercially. Researchers do their researches in various ways. It starts from the data acquisition methods. The data acquisition method varies because of the cost needed for a good device, but cheap method is needed for the Sign Language Recognition System to be commercialized. The methods used in developing Sign Language Recognition are also varied between researchers. Each method has its own strength compare to other methods and researchers are still using different methods in developing their own Sign Language Recognition. Each method also has its own limitations compared to other methods. The aim of this paper is to review the sign language recognition approaches and find the best method that has been used by researchers. Hence other researchers can get more information about the methods used and could develop better Sign Language Application Systems in the future. © 2017 The Authors.

However,there are still many problems to deal with, such as pests and diseases, especially for paddy which is an important crop because it is the main food for people in Indonesia. Many things have been done by the government to solve that problem, but it has not been resolved because of the lack of knowledge of Indonesian farmers. This research proposes a new way to solve that problem by applying optimized Fuzzy Logic (Fuzzy K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means) with Bee Colony to get pest and disease classifications for paddy based on existing symptoms. Bee Colony will be used to determine the initial centroid for Fuzzy Logic. The proposed approach is evaluated based on the accuracy by comparing the value of Mean Square Error (MSE) and the accuracy of every method for pest and disease classifications. MSE of the new model is smaller than regular Fuzzy Logic by 0.016 for FCM and 1.213 for FKM. The accuracy of the new model is greater than regular Fuzzy Logic by 13.87% for FCM and 18.39% for FKM. It can be concluded that Bee Colony can be used to optimize Fuzzy Logic for pest and disease classifications for paddy with better classification results. © 2016 Praise Worthy Prte S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Bee Colony; Classification; Fuzzy C-Mean; Fuzzy K-Means; Fuzzy Logic",,,,,,,"Agbonifo, O.C., Olufolaji, D.B., A Fuzzy Expert System for Diagnosis and Treatment of Maize Plant Diseases (2012) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science and Software Engineering, 2 (12), pp. 83-89; Kaswidjanti, W., Implementasi Mesin Inferensi Fuzzy (Studi Kasus Sistem Pakar untuk Mendiagnosa Penyakit Tanaman Cabe Merah) (2011) TELEMATIKA, 7 (2), pp. 129-138; Tang, H., Ye, J., Zhou, L., Shi, Z., Agriculture Disease Diagnosis Expert System Based on Knowledge and Fuzzy Reasoning: A Case Study of Flower (2009) Sixth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery, , Tianjin; Fina, F., Birch, P., Young, R., Obu, J., Faithpraise, B., Chatwin, C., Automatic Plant Pest Detection and Recognition Using K-Means Clustering Algorithm and Correspondence Filters (2013) International Journal of Advanced Biotechnology and Research, 4 (2), pp. 189-199; Ghosh, S., Dubey, S.K., Comparative Analysis of K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means Algorithms (2013) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 4 (4), pp. 35-39; Sutantoand Suharjito, K., Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment in Game based on Type of Player with ANFIS Method (2014) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 65 (1), pp. 254-260; Shokouhifar, M., Abkenar, G.S., An Artificial Bee Colony Optimization for MRI Fuzzy Segmentation of Brain Tissue (2011) International Conference on Management and Artificial Intelligence, , Bali; Layona, R., Suharjito, S., Tunardi, Y., Tanoto, D., Optimization of Land Suitability for Food Crops Using Neural Network and Swarm Optimization Algorithm (2016) International Review on Computers and Software (IRECOS), 11 (1), pp. 1-7; Karaboga, D., Basturk, B., A powerful and efficient algorithm for numerical function optimization: Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm (2007) J Glob Optim, 39, pp. 459-471; Karaboga, D., Akay, B., A survey: Algorithms simulating bee swarm intelligence (2009) Artif Intell Rev, 31, pp. 61-85; Krishnamoorthi, M., Natarajan, A.M., Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm Integrated with Fuzzy C-Mean Operator for Data Clustering (2013) Journal of Computer Science, 9 (4), pp. 404-412; Malaki, M., Ahangar, F.S., Zakerolhosseini, A., A Novel Hybrid Fuzzy Clustering Algorithm Based on Artificial Bee colony and C-means (2012) Congress on Electrical, Computer and Information Technology (I.T.)

The main problem of this technology is how the system can recognize the presence of a gesture in a streaming video. In this paper, we propose a model that can recognize hand motion gesture in avideo stream using Support Vector Machine and Hidden-Markov model. Support Vector Machine has the advantage of generalizing classification. On the other hand, Hidden Markov Model is a statistical model that is capable of modeling Spatial-temporal time series. This system is divided into two main processes. First, this system recognizes hand posture using SMV (static gesture recognition) and generates sequence observation which is used for the second process later. The second process is recognizing dynamic hand gesture with the sequence observation from the static gesture. The implementation shows that static hand gesture recognition achieves average accuracy at 91% using testing dataset. Meanwhile,dynamically isolated hand gesture recognition gets average accuracy at 89% using testing dataset. We also have tested the system with continuous dynamic gesture using video stream. The system can recognize the gesture very well with accuracy of 83%. This achievement shows that the model can be used in human computer-interaction with specific supports such as Vector Machine and Hidden Markov Model parameter. © 2016 Praise Worthy Prte S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Gesture recognition; Hand gesture recognition; Human computer interaction",,,,,,,"Panwar, M., Singh Mehra, P., Hand gesture recognition for human computer interaction (2011) Int.

In this paper, the combination of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) methods for feature extraction was proposed. The attributes extracted from DCT method were mean and variance, while the attributes extracted from GLCM method were energy and entropy. Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) was used as a classifier. The classifier model was trained using 50% of the texture images and remaining images were used for testing. Four classes of texture images were downloaded from KTH-TIPS (Textures under varying Illumination, Pose and Scale) image database, three of which were used in each experiments thus there were four data combination. The best data testing accuracy result towards textures of crumpled aluminium foil, corduroy, and orange peel is 98.3%, which is 1.6% better than one hidden-layer feed forward neural network classifier. In average, testing accuracy result of ANFIS excelled one hidden-layer feed forward neural network with 93.7% over 90.4%. © 2015 IEEE.","Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System; Discrete Cosine Transform; Gray Level Co-Occurence Matrix; Texture Images","Discrete cosine transforms; Feature extraction; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Image texture; Matrix algebra; Mechanics; MEMS; Pattern recognition; Tracking (position); Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Classifier models; Data combination; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); Energy and entropies; Gray level co occurrence matrix(GLCM); Gray level co-occurence matrix; Texture image; Image classification",,,,,,"Avci, D., Poyraz, M., Leblebicioglu, M., An expert system based on discrete wavelet transform-ANFIS for acquisition and recognition of invariant features from texture images (2015) Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU), 2015 23th, pp. 1070-1073. , May; Chandankhede, P.H., Soft computing based texture classification with matlab tool (2012) International Journal of Soft Computing and Engineering, (2), pp. 475-480; Ruiz, L.A., Fdez-Sarrá, A., Recio, J.A., Texture feature extraction for classification of remote sensing data using wavelet decomposition: A comparative study (2004) International Archives of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 35, pp. 1682-1750; Mohanaiah, P., Sathyanarayana, P., Gurukumar, L., Image texture feature extraction using glcm approach (2013) International Journal of Scientific & Research Publication, 3 (5), pp. 1-5; Wu, C.-H., Lee, J.-S., Shie, C.-Y., Su, M.-Y., Rock classification via a mobile device (2012) Communications and Networking in China (CHINACOM), 2012 7th International ICST Conference on, pp. 663-666. , Aug; Mario Fritz, B.C., Hayman, E., Eklundh, J.-O., (2004) The KTHTIPS and KTH-TIPS2 Image Databases, , http//www.nada.kth.se/cvap/databases/kth-tips/documentation.html; Sorwar, G., Abraham, A., DCT based texture classification using soft computing approach (2004) CoRR, , http//arxiv.org/abs/cs.AI/0405013, cs.AI/0405013; Zhen, W., Zhe, X., SIFT feature extraction algorithm for image in dct domain (2013) Proceedings of the 2nd ISCCCA-13, pp. 261-264; Costianes, P., Plock, J., Gray-level co-occurrence matrices as features in edge enhanced images (2010) Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop (AIPR), 2010 IEEE 39th, pp. 1-6. , Oct; Goswami, S., Bhaiya, L., A hybrid neuro-fuzzy approach for brain abnormality detection using glcm based feature extraction (2013) Emerging Trends in Communication, Control, Signal Processing Computing Applications (C2SPCA), 2013 International Conference on, pp. 1-7. , Oct",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","International Conference on Automation, Cognitive Science, Optics, Micro Electro-Mechanical System, and Information Technology, ICACOMIT 2015","29 October 2015 through 30 October 2015",,121121,,9781467374088,,,"English","Proc.

One alternative that can be used is by using the Google service pack: Fusion Tables and Maps. This research described the development of a prototype for the visualization of GIS to web-based thematic map that was integrated with Google services. The proposed prototype features the upload and conversion of data from excel file XLS and XLSX format into Fusion Tables and displayed the data in a bar chart to explain the map of the area with different color degradation. This research also indicated that the results of upload process and data conversion can be carried out quicker than XLS excel file format as well as a high success rate of the process of merging two tables in Fusion Tables. This indicated that this concept can be implemented on a real thematic digital map system. Therefore, the proposed prototype in this article can be used to facilitate publication in the form of thematic maps on the data owned by the government or companies with using integrated GIS system efficiently.

Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) was a realtively new approach to decompose data into two factors with non-negative entries. This paper shows that the NMF method can be applied in image compression using a model of 2×2 pixels weighted matrix rather than using the model of 200×200 pixels, 10×10 pixels and 4×4 pixels weighted matrix. This paper also shows that the 2×2 Weighted matrix model example of ((65536, 1), (1, 65536)) was the best weighted matrix for NMF image compression.

Diabetes is a serious threat to the health development, because diabetes is a disease that caused most other diseases (complications), such as blindness, kidney failure, heart disease, diabetic foot (gangrene) so it had to be amputated, up to the most serious is strokes. Estimated in 2030, Indonesia will have 21.3 million people with diabetes mellitus. An increasing number of diabetes caused by the late diagnosis of this disease. Therefore, we need a new forecast which could be an invaluable tool in determining whether someone has diabetes or not. So many methods used to generate accurate predictions; one of them is artificial neural network. This study will implement a new method of neural network, namely the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Extreme learning machine is a feed-forward artificial neural network with one or more hidden layers known as single hidden layer feed-forward neural.

Extrinsic plagiarism is now being handled well, but intrinsic plagiarism is not. Intrinsic plagiarism detection is being distracted by the mixed up structure and the using of another word which have the same meaning. Several methods have been research to handle this problem, not only using the pattern reading but also parsing the sentences, but still couldn't give one more accurate way to detect it. In this research, we propose to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create the new way to detect plagiarism. Begin with using syntactic parsing method to parse the suspicious document and find the list of words which have the same meaning with it while considering the Part-Of-Speech (POS) element of that word (semantic parsing). This algorithm also includes creating the new structure of the object before comparing them. The result of this research presents the accuracy comparison between Ferret, WCopyFind, and this algorithm.

The principle in investment is higher return, higher risk. An investment with the very high return, contain very high level of risk. Otherwise if you invest in the financial asset that contain low risk level, then the expected return will be low. Therefore decision of choosing the right investment instrument is very important because it is related to risk, individual readiness in its implementation and suitability of investor profile itself. This thesis propose a machine learning method to develop a decission support system for investment manager in determining the suitable investment instrument for the individual client based on financial objective , risk level and investment period. Machine learning was choosen because it was known of its ability in recognizing the complex pattern based on learning process using the given data set. Artificial neural network multilayer perceptron (MLP) with two layers could be used as a classificator model to predict the mutual fund investment type that was suitable for investor based on investment purpose , risk level and investor profile. Experiment using 2-layers artificial neural network, 9 unit input, 16 hidden units and 4 output units that was trained with 50 data points consists of 9 vestor input component and 4 vector target components. The architecture and the data in the network could done the classification with accuration 93.33 percents. © 2014 SERSC.","Multi layer perceptron; Mutual fund; Neural network",,,,,,,"Diambil kembali dari Basic Investment Instruments (2013), https://www.aia-pt.com.hk/MPF/en/retirement-planning/investment/, November 11; Bishop, C.M., (2007), Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.

The system, in comparison to the rail-based transportation system, is significantly cheaper and requires shorter development time, but lower performance. The BRT system performance strongly depends on variables related to station design and infrastructure. A numerical model offers an effective and efficient means to evaluate the system performance. This article offers a detailed numerical model on the basis of the discrete-event approach and demonstrates its application. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,,"Morichi, S., (2005) Journal of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies, 6 (1); Campo, C., (2010), http://hdl.handle.net/1863/37089, Master's thesis, School of civil and environmental engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology; A.

Analysis of future research topics by using a numerical approach based on scientific publications or patents have been previously done by several researchers mostly by classifying the topics based on the similarity of the documents. Meanwhile, time series analysis using statistical techniques, machine learning and logistic curves has also been conducted but for areas other than research topics. In this study, we will perform time series analysis to predict the topic of research by employing combination of machine learning approaches such as Neural Network, Extreme Learning Machine and Support Vector Machine. The prediction result is then finally refined by logistic curve. The dataset used in this study is a research report on Bioinformatics from Microsoft Research and NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information), over the past 30 years. Experimental result indicates that the combination of machine learning approaches and logistic-curve may improve the prediction accuracy. In addition, the emerging topic of the same dataset can be predicted with a relatively high average precision. Based on the dataset used, some emerging topics predicted for the next three years are 'Sequence Alignment', 'Index Terms', 'Secondary Structure', 'Nucleic Acid', and 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae'. © 2005 - 2013 JATIT & LLS.

This research proposed a model of effort estimation for web application developed using object oriented approach. In the proposed model, researcher combined method for functional size measurement of object oriented based web application named OOmFPWeb by Abrahao and web metric by Mendes for web application size measurement. The estimation process was done by using CBR method with considering 3 projects that are most similar to the project being estimated. To evaluate the proposed model, comparison between OOmFPWeb as the only variable that affect web effort estimation, web metric by Mendes and the proposed model were done. The evaluation result showed that effort estimation for web application with the proposed model is better than just using OOmFPWeb or web metric from Mendes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","FHSWebEE; Functional size estimation; Hypermedia size estimation; Web effort estimation",,,,,,,"Ginige, A., Murugesan, S., Web engineering: An introduction (2001) IEEE Multimedia, 8 (1), pp. 14-18. , January/March; Deshpande, Y., Hansen, S., Web engineering: Creating a discipline among disciplines (2001) IEEE Multimedia, pp. 82-87; Offutt, J., Quality attributes of web software applications (2002) IEEE Software, 19 (2), pp. 25-32. , March/April; Mendes, E., Mosley, N., (2006) Web Engineering, , 1st ed.

It makes research on computer science domain become more and more interesting to be done. Pure and applied research conducted to develop and enrich the knowledge of computer science. Interest of researchers in conducting research in the field of computer science led to a need to know the trend of computer science research topics in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to predict trends to know what are the research topics related to computer science. The extreme learning machine (ELM) is a new artificial neural network method. ELM learning methods designed to overcome the weaknesses of feedforward neural networks, especially in terms of learning speed. This method has the advantage of producing a good generalization performance. This study implements ELM to predict trends in computer science research topics and to analyze the accuracy in predicting the ELM. The results of this study showed that prediction research topics using ELM has a high accuracy with average precision 0.7782 for up rend topics prediction and 0.8954 for down trend topics prediction. The best numbers of input used for prediction in this study are 6 units. ELM performance in terms of speed is better than the performance of linear prediction and backpropagation. ELM performance in terms of testing accuracy is better than the performance of linear prediction and backpropagation. Predicted results using the ELM shows that in 2013 the uptrend topics are: ""Intelligent Web Services and Semantic Web"", ""Ubiquitous Computing"", and ""Web Search"". © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Computer science; Extreme learning machine; Prediction; Trend",,,,,,,"Kobayashi, S., (2005) Technology Trends Analysis from the Internet Resources, , Springer; Small, H., Tracking and predicting growth areas in science (2006) Akadémiai Kiad; Endang, S., Rahayu, R., Hasibuan, Z.A., Identification of technology trend on indonesian patent documents and research reports on chemistry and metallurgy fields (2006) Asia-Pacific Conference on Library & Information Education & Practice, , Singapore; Sun, Z.L., Choi, T.M., Au, K.F., Yu, Y., Sales forecasting using extreme learning machine with application in fashion retailing (2008) Elsevier Decision Support Systems, 46, pp. 411-419; Agustina, I.D., Anggraeni, W., Mukhlason, A., (2010) Penerapan Metode Extreme Learning Machine Untuk Peramalan, , ITS Library; Comer, D.E., Computing as a discipline (1989) Communications of the ACM, 32; IEEE Computer Society, , http://www.computer.org/portal/web/publications/acmtaxonomy, Online; Vercellis, C., (2009) Business Intelligence: Data Mining and Optimization for Decision Making, , Chennai: John Wiley & Sons; Singh, R., Balasundaram, S., Application of extreme learning machine method for time series analysis (2007) World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology; Huang, G.B., Zhu, Q.Y., Siew, C.K., Extreme learning machine : Theory and applications (2006) Elsevier Science : Neurocomputing, 70, pp. 489-501; El-Sebakhy, E.A., Extreme learning machine as a new framework in predicting material properties: Methodology and novita sari et al./procedia engineering 50 ( 2012 ) 871 - 881 881 comparison (2008) The 12th International Conference of International Association for Computer Methods and Advances in Geomechanics, , Goa, Indoa; Tsung, Y.O., Chen, F.L., Constructing a sales forecasting model by integrating gra and elm : A case study for retail industry (2011) International Journal of Electronic Business Management, pp. 107-121; Duan, G., Huang, Z., Wang, J., (2009) Extreme Learning Machine for Bank Clients Classification, , IEEE; Huang, G.B., Wang, D.H., Lan, Y., (2011) Extreme Learning Machines: A Survey, pp. 107-122. , Springer; Keith, J., Sandy, O., Balkina, D., Automatic neural network modeling for univariate time series (2000) Elsevier, No. International Journal of Forecasting; Ziegle, B., (2009) Methods for Bibliometric Analysis of Research: Renewable Energy Case Study, , Cambridge; Zhu, M., (2004) Recall, Precision and Average Precision, , Canada; http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/egbhuang/, Online","Bina Nusantara University, Jl.

So the price of agricultural commodities has a very high risk of fluctuations compared to the price of a finished product. As the farming profession becomes less attractive to farmers engaged in that could threaten the supply of agricultural products as raw materials for industry and national food security. Therefore it is necessary to develop a fairly commodities pricing mechanism to encourage more farmers so that the supply of agricultural products can be sustained. One method to formulate a fair pricing mechanism for farmers is utility risk balancing. This paper will explain a pricing model at farm level by consensus using stakeholder dialogue approach which is based on balancing the fuzzy risk utility preference that will be faced by all levels of the supply chain members. Fuzzy risk utility optimization was used to get consensus of supply chain stakeholder dialogue while basic risk utility function was derived by using fuzzy regression approach. The model is validated in the corn supply chain management to determine the corn price at farmer level using the risk constraints of each stakeholder. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.

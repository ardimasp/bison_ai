Intelligent biometric voice recognition as means to replace this mechanism is proposed as an alternative. The proposed system will decide whether the voice is belong to the user or not and the word utter by the user is 'On' or 'Off'. The decision voice will be sent to Arduino in order to start or stop the engine. The recorded voice is processed in order to get some features which later be used as input to the proposed system. The Mel-Frequency Ceptral Coefficient (MFCC) is adopted as a feature extraction technique. The extracted feature is the used as input to the SVM-based identifier. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent voice recognition and word recognition system. It show that the proposed method produces a good training and testing accuracy, 99.31% and 99.43%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed system shows the performance of false rejection rate (FRR) and false acceptance rate (FAR) accuracy of 0.18% and 17.58%, respectively. In the intelligent word recognition shows that the training and testing accuracy are 100% and 96.3%, respectively. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Aerospace engineering; Biometrics; Feature extraction; Motorcycles; Vocabulary control; Biometric voice; False acceptance rate; False rejection rate; Feature extraction techniques; Intelligent word recognition; Mel frequencies; Training and testing; Word recognition; Speech recognition",,,,,"(2014) Statistik Kriminal 2014, , Badan Pusat Statistik Indonesia; Kung, S.Y., Mak, M.W., Lin, S.H., (2004) Biometric Authentication: Machine Learning Approach, , (Prentice Hall); Omidiora, E.O., Fakolujo, O.A., Arulogun, O.T., Aborisade, D.O., A Prototype of a Fingerprint Based Ignition Systems in Vehicles (2011) Eropean Journal of Scientific Research, 62, pp. 164-171; Matyáš, V., Říha, Z., Biometric Authentication - Security and Usability (2002) Proceedings of the IFIP TC6/TC11 Sixth Joint Working Conference on Communications and Multimedia Security: Advanced Communications and Multimedia Security, pp. 227-239; Wahyudi Astuti, W., Mohamed, S., Intelligent Voice-Based Door Access Control System Using Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) for Building Security (2007) J.

In this research, it is developed customized application software for CNC (Computer Numerically Controlled) machines using open source platform. The application is enable us to create designs by means of fractal patterns using L-System, developed by turtle geometry interpretation and Python programming languages. The result of the application is the G-Code of fractal pattern formed by the method of L-System. In the experiment on the CNC machine, the G-Code of fractal pattern which involving the branching structure has been able to run well. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,"Smid, P., (2003) CNC Programming Handbook 2 Nd Edition, , New York: Industrial Press Inc; Bovill, C., Fractal geometry as design aid (2000) Journal for Geometry and Graphics, 4 (1), pp. 71-78; Soo, S.C., Yu, K.M., (2001) Rapid Prototyping Using Fractal Geometry, pp. 424-431; (2011) User Manual v 2.4, , http://www.linuxcnc.org/docs/EMC2_User_Manual.pdf, The EMC Team; Starovešk, T., Brezak, D., Udiljak, T., Majetić, D., Implementation of a linux-based CNC open control system 12th International Scientific Conference on Production Engineering - CIM (2009); Ascher, D., Martelli, A., Ravenscroft, A., (2005) Python Cookbook, , USA: O'Reilly; Mandelbrot, B.B., (1983) The Fractal Geometry of Nature, , New York: W.H.

In this work, a novel nanocomposite coating was developed as a possible method for maintaining the quality attributes of the samples. Chitosan and ZnO nanoparticles (ZnONP) were selected to inhibit microbial growth on fresh-cut papaya. The aims of this work were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and effect of nanocomposite coating made of chitosan combined with ZnONP on microbial growth of fresh-cut papaya stored for 12 days at 10°C. The preliminary work was conducted to select the best formulation exhibiting the greatest bacterial inhibition effect which was chitosan combined with 0.027% ZnONP (by weight of nanocomposite solution). The results revealed that the average diameter of ZnO was 611.30 nm with polydispersion index of 0.011 confirmed by particle size analyzer (PSA). All components were completely contained in nanocomposite analyzed by Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) for its microstructure and presence of ZnONP in the film. Selected nanocomposite application on fresh-cut papaya could suppress microbial growth significantly in comparison with uncoated papaya during storage time. Our study suggests that nanocomposite treatment provides a desirable method to maintain and improve fresh-cut papaya postharvest life. © 2019 The Authors.

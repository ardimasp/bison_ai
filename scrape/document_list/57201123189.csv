These days, the emerging growth of technology creates an increasing trend for art commissions, as the process can now be done through the Internet rather than physical meetings. Art commissions are often conducted through social media or other general e-commerce web platforms. However, the current solutions are lacking in features which are needed to support the art-commissioning process. One of the problems is the unorganized commission ordering process. As a result, it is difficult to make the art-commissioning process a smooth experience. A feature such as a recommender system can be implemented in a website to improve the art-commissioning process. This paper aims to develop a system that can be used to recommend artwork images based on the combination of features of artwork image, art style category and user-generated tag contents. The recommendation algorithm takes into account a combination of the features content of the image, the category which refers to the art style, and the descriptive tags including similar tags. Our experiments and test on the users suggest that the recommender system worked well in recommending artworks to potential art buyers. © 2017 IEEE.","Content-based filtering; Digital artwork; Image search; Recommender system","Arts computing; Electronic commerce; Search engines; Commissioning process; Content based filtering; Digital artwork; Image search; Ordering process; Recommendation algorithms; Social media; User-generated; Recommender systems",,,,,"Read, R., (2015) Hiscox Corporate, , http://www.hiscoxgroup.com/~/media/Files/H/Hiscox/reports/Hiscox%20Online%20Art%20Trade%20Report%202015.pdf; Lubis, M., (2014) Indonesian Consumers Flock Online to Purchase Products and Services, , http://www.nielsen.com/id/en/press-room/2014/indonesian-consumersflock-online-to-purchase-products-and-services.html; Ellen, Web-based digital art commission: Process subsystem (2016) Technical Report, Binus University International; Saputra, M.D., Web-based digital art commission: Structure subsystem (2016) Technical Report, Binus University International; Linyuan, L., Medo, M., Yeung, C.H., Zhang, Y.C., Zhang, Z.K., Zhou, T., Recommender systems (2012) Physics Reports, 519 (1), pp. 1-49; Burke, R., Hybrid recommender systems: Survey and experiments (2002) User Modeling and User-adapted Interaction, 12 (4), pp. 331-370; Balabanovic, M., Shoham, Y., Fab: Content-based, collaborative recommendation (1997) Communications of the ACM, 40 (3), pp. 66-72; Godoy, D., Corbellini, A., Folksonomy based recommender systems: A state of the art review (2016) International Journal of Intelligent Systems, 31 (4), pp. 314-346; Zhang, Z.K., Zhou, T., Zhang, Y.C., Tag-aware recommender systems: A state-of-the-art survey (2011) Journal of Computer Science and Technology, 26 (5), pp. 767-777; Musto, C., Narducci, F., Lops, P., De Gemmis, M., Semeraro, G., Content-based personalization services integrating folksonomies (2009) International Conference on Electronic Commerce and Web Technologies, , September.

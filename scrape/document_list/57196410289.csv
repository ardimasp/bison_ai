In order to support the development of this industry, it is a common practice that government provide tax incentives. While major prior research in tax incentives focus on the impact of tax incentives on economic development, this research focuses on the impact on corporate performance. This research studies digital TV tax incentives in Canada, Indonesia, and the United States of America (USA). Using EGARCH econometric model on the largest digital TV corporations in these three countries, this research finds that tax incentives are beneficial to support corporate performance with some exception.

Currently, in warehouse storage systems are mainly still done in a traditional way using human operator to store and pick goods into specified location. This project is intended to construct an autonomous mini forklift robot that use using Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID) technology to find the coordinates of targeted storage slot and goods identification. The control of movement consist of DC Motor with Pulse Width Modulation and infrared sensors for the line follower. The programming operation was performed by C language using Visual Studio 2005, CodeVisionAVR 2.05, and SQL 2005 as database. The program on the computer can serve two purposes. Firstly, program can check, read, write, and erase data on RFID Tags. Secondly, program can ask a mini forklift robot to store and pick goods at specified location. The robot can recognize two sides (A and B), 128 lines, 16 columns and 16 rows cabinets. The total of success achieved was 100% in storing goods but 58.33% in retrieving goods, because robot fails parking correctly to the base. © 2011 AICIT.","forklift; line follower; radiofrequency identification; robot","C language; CodeVisionAVR; forklift; Human operator; Infra-red sensor; line follower; Radio frequencies; Radio frequency identification devices; RF-ID tags; Storage systems; Visual studios; C (programming language); Cryptography; DC motors; Information technology; Materials handling equipment; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Radio navigation; Robots; Machine design",,,,,"Chuan, L.P., Johari, A., Helmy, M., Wahab, A., Nor, D.Md., Afifi, N.S., Taujuddin, Md., An RFID warehouse robot (2007) Proceeding of IEEE International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced System 2007 (ICIAS2007), KLCC, , 25 - 28 November; Tan, J., Chen, H., Manufacturing logistics management Using RFID: Dynamic and Case Study (2010) Proceeding of IEEE International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling 2010 (ICCASM 2010), , Taiyuan, 22-24 October; Guo, Z., Zhang, X., The application of RFID technology in the logistics supply chain (2010) Proceeding of IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology (ICCSIT), 2010, , Chengdu, 9-11 July; Kamal, I., (2008) Build A 5A H-Bridge Motor Driver, , http//www.ikalogic.com/H_bridge_old.php; Soebakti, H., (2007) Basic AVR Microcontroller Tutorial, , Politeknik-Batam, Batam; Barnet, Cox, O'cull, (2003) Embedded C Programming and the Atmel AVR, , Thomson Learning.

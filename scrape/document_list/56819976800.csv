Internet connection is the essential infrastructure in the current business environment. Service Providers provide the Internet connections to corporate networks. It processes network data to enable the Internet business communications and transactions. Mining the network data of a particular corporate network resulted in its business traffic profile or characteristics.

The VAS is competitive as only the Service Provider and its customer know the traffic profile. The knowledge becomes the barrier of entry for competitors. To offer the VAS, a Service Provider must build close relationship with its customer for acceptance. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

There are many people whose the living standards are under poverty line. It is caused by the community mindset, unequal education level, and high competitiveness in the world of work. Hence, there are many social-based businesses for improving the community welfare by giving various aids both in form of workforce, training, and funds. The more the number of companies in the social sector is, it certainly needs a tool that can illustrate this business as a whole. The impacts of social business are social impact and economic impact. It is about how those two impacts can be coexisted, provide positive things to many people, and improve the growth of the company significantly. This research aimed to understand the illustration of the business model in social business that can give social impact and economic impact and appropriate strategy to the company. Thereby, it can improve the competitiveness and provide the literature review about the concept and the social practice of enterprise in Indonesia. Social Business Model Canvas is a business model commonly applied to a social-based business so that it can map the business out effectively. © 2020, Allied Business Academies.

The development of this business is inseparable from the times. A few years ago SMEs in the promotion strategy and sales strategy were still offline and their marketing strategy still used advertisements and brochures while in the sales process, they still used the business location or shop as a place for meetings between traders and sellers. Current use patterns need to change to incorporate digitization and a digital marketing strategy is needed which utilizes websites, blogs or social media as a means of promotion and consequently sales strategy must utilize websites, social media, chat applications or e-commerce. However, there are still many SME business people who do not use digital marketing as their business strategy. This is due to their ignorance of how to use digital marketing in the sales process. Therefore the aim of this research is to create a digital marketing training model for SMEs which will be used in business development. Based on the results and discussion, the impact of the training is that MSME entrepreneurs will be able to carry out digital marketing in their business, such as promotions using websites, chat applications or by using social media and in context of the sales process, can use a website, chat application, social media or e-commerce. To facilitate digital marketing training, it is necessary to determine SME awareness and access to information about digital marketing. Therefore Digital Marketing Readiness Level (DMRL) was created that will function to determine the extent of mastery of digital marketing by SMEs. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Digital marketing; DMRL; SMEs; Training",,,,,,"We gratefully acknowledge the supporting Bina Nusantara University Research Technology Transfer Office who funded this research until publication of this research.","Artaya, I.P., Baktiono, R.A., Memilih Media Sosial yang Efektif Sebagai Sarana Marketing Online Bagi Pelaku UKM di Kabupaten Sidoarjo (2016) E-Jurnal Spirit Pro Patria, 2, pp. 8-21; Asmara, A.Y., Rahayu, S., Meningkatkan Daya Saing Industri Kecil Menengah Melalui Inovasi Dan Pemanfaatan Jaringan Sosial: Pembelajaran dari Klaster Industri Software di India (2013) Sustainable Competitive Advantage (SCA), (3). , 3.1; Penetrasi & Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia 2017 (2017) Penetrasi Dan Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia, pp. 1-39. , https://web.kominfo.go.id/sites/default/files/LaporanSurveiAPJII_2017_v13.pdf; Beaver, G., Hutchings, K., Training and developing an age diverse workforce in SMEs: The need for a strategic approach (2005) Education and Training, 47 (8-9), pp. 592-604. , https://doi.org/10.1108/00400910510633134; Broad, M.L., Overview of Transfer of Training: From Learning to Performance (1997) Performance Improvement Quarterly, 10 (2), pp. 7-21; Bucher, R.D., (2000) Diversity Consciousness, , New Jersey: Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River; Chang, J., Song, T., Li, C., Song, T., Modeling E-commerce website quality with quality function deployment (2009) Proceedings-IEEE International Conference on eBusiness Engineering, pp. 417-422. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEBE.2009.65, ICEBE 2009; IEEE Int.

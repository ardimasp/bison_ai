For this project, we successfully developed a smart food cabinet with the abilities to perform several things such as giving information about the items stored within the smart food cabinet to its users via a mobile application. By using the information, the users contact the store to order the items needed. The food cabinet takes the data from the smart cabinet about the items and combine them to its own data to give information about recipes selection according to the availability of the items in both smart food cabinet and refrigerator. The system is built based on Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and the results shows that the recipes displayed in the LCD are according the availability of the items. The information can be accessed via Android based application in a smartphone. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Data sharing; Smart appliances; Smart cabinet; Smart home; Smart refrigerator",,,,,"0422/K3/KM/2017

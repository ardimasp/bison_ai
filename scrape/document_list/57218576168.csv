Meatball quality including microbial growth, pH, aw, and sensory attributes was evaluated after immersed into nanocomposite solution for 1 min and drained. The combination of chitosan and ZnO NPs exhibited a synergistic effect in suppressing gram-negative bacterial growth. Chitosan-ZnO NPs 0.05% could prolong the shelf life of meatball beyond 24 hrs indicated by aerobic microbes of 4.30 log CFU/g which was lower than the threshold for consumption (5 log CFU/g). Coating solution also significantly influenced the pH of meatballs up to 24 hrs of storage allowing lower sensory acceptability. Moreover, the low organoleptic score for taste and overall acceptability attributes were found as a consequence of the addition of ZnO NPs. Finally, the results of the present study suggested that chitosan-based coating containing ZnO NPs could be used as an alternative to maintaining meatball quality, particularly in microbial decay context. © 2020, Rynnye Lyan Resources.

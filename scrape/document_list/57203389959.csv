Employing the machine learning technique of artificial neural network (ANNs) to develop a prediction model with fewer experiments and tests is a gentle solution to forecast the properties of the spot weld structures. In this study, the extended full factorial design with respect to thetool speed, plunge depth, anddwell time are applied to the FSSW specimens of aluminium A5052-H122 of 2mm thick through 27 experiments and evaluated via tensile shearing load testing. The multilayer neural network of feed-forward and back-propagation (FFBP) algorithm was engaged to learn and train the neural network iteratively with a set of weights and bias of 27 variations of inputs to fit the predicted tensile shear loads of the spot weld structures. Based on the resulted of regression plot, it is shown that the correlation coefficient (R) is perfect for training with the value of 0.999 and for testing the correlation coefficient (R) is reached to 0.958. However, the correlation coefficient is relatively good for validation with R equal to 0.921. For all data sets, the correlation coefficient is good with R of 0.833. It can be seen that the ANNs prediction model is relatively good since the correlation coefficient relatively close to 1. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","aluminium alloy; artificial neural network;

The significant issue in FSSW is the existence of porosity or wormholes, leads to welding failure. One reason is due to imperfect heat generation leads to temperature distribution during FSSW effect to uncertain weldment formation. This is mainly influenced by improper parameters selection. In this study, the temperature distribution in the weld zones is investigated using finite element analysis via computer numerical simulation of Altair Hyperworks software with respect to parameters i.e. spindle speed, tool plunge depth, and tool dwell time. In the simulation, tool plunge depth and tool dwell time is set constant, but spindle speed was varied from 1400, 1500, and 1600 rpm respectively. Based on the results found that at a spindle speed of 1400 rpm was produced max temperature in the weld zone at 540 °C. Meanwhile, at 1500 rpm increased the temperature at 596 °C. At 1600 rpm reached its highest temperature at 650 °C. The results show that increasing tool rotational speed, at a constant tool plunge depth and constant tool dwell time will increase the amount of temperature distribution in the weld-zones. It is concluded that the suitable temperature distribution required in FSSW is 540 °C represented the solid-state joining process provided by spindle speed of 1400 rpm. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","aluminium alloy; finite element analysis; Friction stir spot welding","Aluminum alloys; Computer software; Friction; Friction stir welding; Speed; Spot welding; Temperature distribution; Welds; Friction stir spot welding; Highest temperature; Hyperworks software; Parameters selection; Rotational speed; Solid-state joining; Solid-state welding; Spindle speed; Finite element method",,,,"Binus University: 033/VR, RTT/IV/2019","The authors would like to acknowledge for financial support from Bina Nusantara University through Hibah Terapan BINUS in 2019 with the contract no.: 033/VR.RTT/IV/2019, for funding this research activity.

To handle this problem, this research conducts an effort to develop methods to determine tensile strength properties of Friction Stir Welding (FSW) in Aluminum alloy using prediction model. An artificial intelligent technique, i.e. Artificial Neural Network (ANNs) is used to develop the prediction model. Initial work involves FSW welding experiment and testing of subsequent result to analyze the tensile strength properties of the welding structure based on process parameter input. Prediction model is developed based on Back Propagation (BP) of error to predict tensile strength of the FSW structure. Input parameters for the model is tool rotational speed and travel speed while output of the model is the tensile strength of FSW welded structures. Proposed prediction model is then trained with experiment data. Testing of the proposed prediction model was then conducted using unused experiment data from the training. Research result shows that proposed prediction model is aligned with experiment data. This shows that average error value from the training and testing is 0.010286 or very small (close to zero) which means that the desired output of the prediction model for the training and testing is close to each other. Result from regression graph for training and testing shows matching linear regression between output and target when compared to dash line of the ideal result. This shows an absolute linear relationship where R equals to 0.9 or close to 1. This proves good compatibility the prediction model. © IEOM Society International.","Artificial neural network; Friction stir welding; Tensile strength",,,,,,,"Chen, S.C., Lin, S.W., Tseng, T.Y., Lin, H.C., Optimization of back-propagation network using simulated annealing approach 2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics October 8-11, pp. 2819-2824. , 2006, Taipei, Taiwan; Uzun, H., Donne, C.D., Argagnotto, A., Ghidini, T., Gambaro, C., Friction stir welding of dissimilar Al 6013-T4 To X5CrNi18-10 stainless steel (2005) Materials & Design, 26, pp. 41-46; Okuyucu, H., Kurt, A., Erol Arcaklioglu, Artificial neural network application to the friction stir welding of aluminum plates (2007) Elsevier, Materials and Design, 28, pp. 78-84; Zhou, J., Ren, J., Yao, C., Multi-objective optimization of multi-axis ball-end milling Inconel 718 via grey relational analysis coupled with RBF neural network and PSO algorithm (2017) Elsevier, Measurement, 102, pp. 271-285. , May; Maleki, E., Sherafatnia, K., Investigation of single and dual step shot peening effects on mechanical and metallurgical properties of 18CrNiMo7-6 steel using artificial neural network (2016) Int.

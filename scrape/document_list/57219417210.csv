The research was a case study of a water park in east suburb of greater Jakarta area, Indonesia. The objective of the study was to help the studied company to identify what service attributes relevant for the water park and which ones are important to be improved. The study categorised service attributes using Kano model in order to capture possible nonlinear relationship between importance and satisfaction. The result was then analysed using SIPA grids by benchmarking its performance against two competitors. The result showed that currently there are only some 'keep alert attributes' and no 'key improving attributes'. However, after performing sensitivity analysis by slicing the data based on key respondents' demographic profiles, the SIPA-Kano analysis revealed some insights for possible improvement and recommendations.

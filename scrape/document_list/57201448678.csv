This study intends to develop such the capability on the basis of the data of the brain waves: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. For the purpose, a number of participants are asked to participate in the study where their brain waves are recorded by using a low-cost Neurosky Mindwave EEG sensor. In the process, the participants are performing a continuous performance test from which their attention levels are directly measured in the form of the response time in conjunction to those waves. When the response time is much longer than a normal one, the participant attention is assumed to be dropped. A simple k-NN classification method is used with the k = 3. The results are the following. The best detection of the attention drop is achieved when the attention features are extracted from the earliest stage of the brain wave signals. The brain wave signal should be recorded longer than 1 s since the time the stimulus is presented as a short signal leads to a poor categorization. A significant drop in the level of response time is required to provide the brain signal that better predicts the change of the attention. © 2017 IEEE.",,,,,,,"Bassili, J.N., Emotion recognition: The role of facial movement and the relative importance of upper and lower areas of the face (1979) American Psychological Association, 37 (11), p. 2049; Marouane, S., Najlaa, S., Abderrahim, T., Eddine, E.K., Towards measuring learners concentration in e-learning systems (2015) International Journal of Computer Techniques, 2 (5), pp. 27-29; Hindarto, H., Sumarmo, S., Feature extraction of electroencephalography signals using fast fourier transform (2016) Commit (Communication & Information Technology) Journal, 10 (1), pp. 49-52; Busso, C., Deng, Z., Yildirim, S., Bulut, M., Lee, C.M., Kazemzadeh, A., Lee, S., Narayanan, S., Analysis of emotion recognition using facial expressions, speech and multimodal information (2004) In Proceedings of the 6Th International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces.

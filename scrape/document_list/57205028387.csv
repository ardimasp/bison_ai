One of the important things is right decision in issues of supplier selection. The improper supplier affects consequence negatively to the quality of company's business process. Thus, the right way to answer the issues is incredibly crucial to be proposed. This study aims to design an application to determine the sub-criteria weight with Fuzzy-AHP method, select the best supplier via Fuzzy-TOPSIS method, and calculate the allocation of quota to each supplier thru Fuzzy-MOLP method. The study was conducted on high class store by taking the object of material gymnastic product (spandex). Simulation confidently demonstrates that the Fuzzy-AHP approach is able to be operated to generate parameter Quality Product as the best sub-criteria (with value 0.221), the Fuzzy-TOPSIS technique can be used to ring out the supplier (where CV. Maju Jaya Abadi as the best supplier), and the method Fuzzy-MOLP is exploited to calculate the allocation of quota (where CV. Maju Jaya Abadi as a supplier with the highest percentage of 44.40%). © 2018 IEEE.","decision support application; fuzzy AHP; fuzzy logic; fuzzy MOLP; fuzzy TOPSIS; supplier selection","Computer circuits; Decision support systems; Economics; Hierarchical systems; Information management; Decision support applications; Fuzzy AHP; fuzzy MOLP; FUZZY TOPSIS; Supplier selection; Fuzzy logic",,,,,"Yazdani, M., Chatterjee, P., Zavadskas, E.K., Zolfani, S.H., Integrated QFD-MCDM framework for green supplier selection (2017) Journal of Cleaner Production, 142 (4), pp. 3728-3740; Manello, A., Calebrese, G., The influence of reputation on supplier selection: An empirical study of the European automotive industry (2018) Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, , In press; Lo, H.-W., Liou, J.J.H., Wang, H.-S., Tsai, Y.-S., An integrated model for solving problems in green supplier selection and order allocation (2018) Journal of Cleaner Production, 90, pp. 339-352; Sarkar, S., Pratihar, D.K., Sarkar, B., An integrated fuzzy multiple criteria supplier selection approach and its application in a welding company (2018) Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 46, pp. 163-178; Hamdan, S., Cheaitou, A., Dynamic green supplier selection and order allocation with quantity discounts and varying supplier availability (2017) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 110, pp. 573-589; Sun, C.-C., A performance evaluation model by integrating fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS methods (2010) Expert Systems with Applications, 37, pp. 7745-7754; Shaw, K., Shankar, R., Yadav, S.S., Thakur, L.S., Supplier selection using fuzzy AHP and fuzzy multi-objective linear programming for developing low carbon supply chain (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39 (9), pp. 8182-8192; Zadeh, L.A., Fuzzy logic = computing with words (1996) IEEE Transaction of Fuzzy Systems, 4 (2), pp. 103-111; Liou, J.J.H., Yen, L., Tzeng, G.-H., Building an effective safety management system for airlines (2008) Journal of Air Transport Management, 14 (1), pp. 20-26; Wu, W.-W., Lee, Y.-T., Developing global managers competencies using the fuzzy DEMATEL method (2007) Expert Systems with Applications, 32 (2), pp. 499-507; Utama, D.N., Nuryasin, F., Rustamaji Nurbojatmiko, E., Qoyim, I., D&T: An Euclidean distance optimization based intelligent donation system model for solving the communitys problem (2016) Journal of Physics: Conf.

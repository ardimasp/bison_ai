One of the ERP System is Dynamics NAV used by IGMLabs. Nevertheless, with the revenue sharing process at IGMLabs, modification is needed to automate the manual summarizing hospital transactions from excel and to automate the manual sales invoice creation process. The sales process, especially the revenue sharing process will be analyzed with ABC or Activity-Based Costing method and the modification will be implemented with Agile technique with steps from Roger S. Pressman's Extreme Programming (XP) model and the testing will use the Blackbox Testing method. The result will automate the summarizing process of transactions from hospitals via web service with one simple step and automate the sales invoice creation just with a simple button. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cost accounting; Enterprise resource planning; Hospitals; Sales; Testing; Web services; Activity-based costing methods; Black-box testing methods; Creation process; EXtreme Programming; General systems; Health industry; Revenue-sharing; Sales process; Black-box testing",,,,,"Ali, Z., (2008) Hukum Asuransi Syariah; Alianto, Wijaya, Arlan, An Analysis of Sales Information System and Competitive Advantage (2012) International Journal of Communication & Information Technology, 6 (75); Chang James, F., (2006) Business Process Management Systems; Antonio Syafi', I., (2001) Bank syari'Ah Teori Dan Praktek; Bradford, M., (2018) Modern ERP: Select, Implement and Use Today's Advanced Business Systems; Ifham, A., (2015) Bank Syariah Memahami Bank Syariah Dengan Mudah; O'Brien James, A., Marakas, (2010) Introduction to Information System; O'Brien James, A., Marakas, (2015) Management Information Systems; Pearlson, K.E., Saunders, C.S., Galletta, D.F., (2016) Managing and Using Information Systems: A Strategic Approach; Pressman Roger, S., (2010) Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach; Romney, M.B., Steinbart, P.J., (2015) Accounting Information Systems","Mursitama, T.N.; International Relations Department, Indonesia; email: tmursitama@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

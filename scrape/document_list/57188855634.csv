""The Mechanic"" game application allows player to be entertained with the challenging obstacles in the game play and heroic story that inculcate the user the virtue of perennial nobility and aligned with a specific educational setting. Data collection methods are questionnaire, literature study, and observation of similar game application. The Application Design method applied is agile scrum. This method allows us to build a game application more efficiently and flexibly since it allows us to improve our game design on every iteration of the scrum process. The conclusion of this research is 3D action puzzle game ""The Mechanic"" entertain the player with the challenging game play and heroic story. © 2015 IEEE.","3D game; action; PC; puzzle","E-learning; Mechanics; Personal computers; 3D games; action; Application design; Data collection method; Educational settings; Literature studies; puzzle; Puzzle games; Iterative methods",,,,,"Theodore, G., (2011) The Jigsaw Puzzle: Piecing Together A History, , ISBN-13 978-1579128883; Interactive digital software association (2012) The Seventh Annual Consumer Survey; Tay, V., (2010) Multimedia: Making It Work, , Eighth Edition.

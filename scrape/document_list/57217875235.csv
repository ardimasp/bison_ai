The game application called AR Virtual Pet Simulator is a simulator game which uses Augmented Reality technology to display a virtual pet, for the purpose of enhancing the users' experience. Users can also interact by using application to understand the daily behaviours of pets. Application development methods are carried out starting from gathering requirements, design, implementation, to testing and evaluation. Results from the end evaluation shows that the application was well-liked by users and it could help users in knowing how to take care of pets, but the experience of using the application is not the same as having a pet in the real world. Conclusion gathered from the research is that applications with virtual pets are not able to entirely replace real pets but are able to provide knowledge on taking care of pets. Where users cannot interact directly with pets. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Android (operating system); Augmented reality; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Simulators; User experience; Android platforms; Application development; Augmented reality technology; Interactive technology; Real-world; Testing and evaluation; Users' experiences; Virtual reality",,,,,"Martono, K.T., Pengembangan Game dengan Menggunakan Game Engine Game Maker (2015) Jurnal Sistem Komputer, 5, pp. 23-30; (2018) Global Market Share Held by Smartphone Operating Systems, 2009-2018, by Quarter [Online], , https://www.statista.com/statistics/266136/global-market-share-held-by-smartphone-operating-systems/, Statista Diakses 8 Mei 2019 dar; Saputra, Y.A., Implementasi Augmented Reality (AR) pada Fosil Purbakala di Museum Geologi Bandung (2014) Jurnal Ilmiah Komputer Dan Informatika (KOMPUTA), 1, pp. 1-8; Craig, A.B., (2013) Understanding Augmented Reality Concepts and Applications; Caesar, R., Kajian Pustaka Perkembangan Genre Games dari Masa ke Masa (2015) Journal of Animation and Games Studies, 1, pp. 113-134; (2018), https://www.wepc.com/news/video-game-statistics/, WePC Worldwide Unit Sales of the Best Selling PC Games of All Times in Millions Units (January 2018) [Online].

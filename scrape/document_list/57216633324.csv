Cloud computing can be implemented at PT. XYZ due to minimal cost and no intensive maintenance needed to develop the application when it has data updates. Cloud computing technology should be used as the capability of the complex infrastructure progress of the server on premise requires very high maintenance costs as well as waste of resources, the presence of cloud computing offers unique characteristics to address the problems faced IT Department in the development system. © 2020 SERSC.","Business architecture; Cloud Computing; Enterprise; Framework; TOGAF",,,,,,"Lele, Cloud computing (2019) Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies; Santikarama Dan, I., Arman, A.A., Designing enterprise architecture framework for non-cloud to cloud migration using TOGAF, CCRM, and CRMM (2016) 2016 International Conference on ICT for Smart Society, ICISS, p. 2016; Joyanes, L., Cloud Computing - Notes for a Spanish Cloud Computing Strategy (2012) J.

For this reason, the growth of Chinese language learners, especially in universities, also increases from time to time. Given that Chinese is a language that is difficult to learn, it is not enough to only face-to-face lessons in class, so that a tool is needed that can help students learn independently in a comfortable place and time. This research begins with a survey of what students need to face obstacles in learning Mandarin vocabulary and the applications needed to support their learning. From the results of the survey on 37 students who studied Mandarin for 4 months, the researchers designed learning applications based on the needs of students. The material from the application is taken from the subject matter in the textbook. Listening lessons are considered difficult by 83.49% of students because of vocabulary. As many as 73.38% of students consider the need for an application that helps vocabulary learning and as many as 83.78% of students need an application on a smartphone that can be used offline. From the student input, an application called ""Smart Word"" was designed. For the next research, the researcher suggestion is that the ""Smart Word"" application can be used to measure the results of student studies. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Students; Surveys; Chinese investors; Chinese language; Face to face; Indonesia; Offline; Student studies; Subject matters; Vocabulary learning; Engineering education",,,,,"Wang, F., Chen, X., Fang, W., Integrating cell phones into a Chinese high school EFL classroom: Students' attitudes, technological readiness, and perceived learning (2011) Journal .Of Education Technology Development and Exchange, 4 (1), pp. 91-102; Zhang, H., Song, W., Burston, J., Reexamining the effectiveness of vocabulary learning via mobile phones (2011) Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology, 10, pp. 203-204; Tai, Y., Contextualizing a MALL: Practice design and evaluation (2012) Educational Technology. & Society, 15, pp. 220-230; Wu, T., Sung, T., Huang, Y., Yang, C., Yang, J.-C., Ubiquitous English learning system with dynamic personalized guidance of learning portfolio (2011) Educational Technology & Society, 14, pp. 164-180; Yang, T.-Y., Chen, H.-J., Colpaert, J., Aerts, A., Wu, Y.-C., Chao, J., Investigating the effects of a mobile game on EFL learners' vocabulary learning (2012) The Medium Matters: Proceedings 15th International CALL Conference, 23 (3), pp. 697-700; Nah, K.-C., The use of the internet through mobile phones for EFL listening activities (2010) Proceedings Applied Linguistics Association of Korea 2010 Annual Conference, pp. 197-205; Nah, K.-C., Optimising the use of wireless application protocol (WAP) sites for listening activities in a Korean English as a foreign language (EFL) context (2011) Computer.

For Chinese learners, Indonesian affixes are difficult to understand because the addition of affixes to basic words can change the meaning of words and types of words. In addition, affixes in Indonesian also experience what is called sound fusion in affix letters and basic words. From the survey, respondents are not familiar with the prefixes of me-, ber-, di-, se-, ke-, per-, the suffix of-i, and the confix ke-an, per-an, se-nya. Therefore, at the time of prefix teaching, it should be stated that the sound fusion in prefix of me-will occur if the initial letter of the basic word has the sound of /a/,/e/,/g/,/h/,/i/,/u/,/o/,/k/. When explaining the prefix di-, the learners need to be shown a comparison form and meaning with the preposition di, so that the learner understands the different uses. As for learning prefixes and other confixes, the learners need to be provided with various examples and sentence exercises so that they are accustomed to the sound fusión in prefixes and types of words changes that are formed with the addition of the affix. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Surveys; Chinese students; Indonesian languages; Engineering education",,,,,"Sobarna, C., (2013) Pengajaran Bahasa Indonesia di Shanghai: Sebuah Peluang Dan Tantangan; Park, J.H., Potensi dan tantangan bahasa Indonesia menuju bahasa internasional (2015) J.

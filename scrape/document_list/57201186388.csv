However, most of the residential buildings were designed for gravity loading only and lack of detailed to resist the seismic load. This research focused on the seismic evaluation of an existing typical residential building that was assumed to be located in different regions (Makkah, Jeddah, Gizan and Haql). This was accomplished by conducting a pushover analysis to simulate the nonlinear behaviour of the building. The analysis results in the failure mechanism of the building so that the weak elements can be monitored. These results help engineers to take any action for rehabilitation and strengthening work. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","concrete building; local practice; pushover; seismic assessment","Concrete buildings; Failure (mechanical); Housing; Seismic design; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; local practice; Nonlinear behaviours; Push-over analysis; pushover; Residential building; Seismic assessment; Seismic evaluation; Seismology",,,,"King Abdulaziz University, KAU

It was found that many building failures occurred due to design shortage or construction shortcomings. This research is intended to propose the evaluation method for the concrete building against the possible earthquake. Pushover analysis was performed to study the nonlinear behaviour of a concrete building. A total of two types of concrete buildings, designed for seismic and designed for gravity load only, were investigated. The results show that the concrete building designed for seismic has better performance in both local and global response than that of the concrete building designed for gravity. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","concrete building; inelastic behavior; pushover; seismic assessment","Concrete buildings; Earthquakes; Reinforced concrete; Inelastic behavior; Local and global response; Moment resisting frames; Nonlinear behaviours; Push-over analysis; pushover; Seismic assessment; Seismic evaluation; Structural design",,,,"Binus University","The authors would like to thank BINUS University for funding this research.","Ashar, F., Amaratunga, D., Sridarran, P., Haigh, R., (2019) Practices of Tsunami Evacuation Planning in Padang; (2018) Lombok Earthquake, , https://www.bbc.com/indonesia/indonesia-45237703, BBC News; Dya, A.F.C., Oretaa, A.W.C., Seismic Vulnerability Assessment of Soft Story Irregular Buildings Using Pushover Analysis (2015) Procedia Eng., 125, pp. 925-932; Fajfar, P., Structural analysis in earthquake engineering - A breakthrough of simplified non-linear methods (2000) 12th Eur.

The scenarios of heating columns located in various different fire compartments (internal, edge and corner bay) are first studied to investigate load redistribution paths and members’ interactions within the composite frame. The results show that the loads previously supported by the heated columns are redistributed to adjacent columns along two horizontal directions, a phenomenon which cannot be captured in a 2D model. Then, the 3D model is adopted to investigate the effect of residual deformation after an earthquake on the progressive collapse behaviour of the composite building. It is found that neither the load redistribution path nor the fire resistance of the building is considerably affected by the residual deformation. A series of progressive collapse analyses subjected to travelling fires resulting from fire compartment damage is also performed. It is concluded that the survival of the building can be greatly affected by the spatial nature of the travelling fire as well as the inter-zone time delay. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Collapse mechanism; Composite building; Earthquake damage; Load redistribution; Post-earthquake fire; Progressive collapse; Travelling fire","Deformation; Earthquakes; Steel construction; Structural frames; Collapse mechanism; Composite buildings; Earthquake damages; Load redistribution; Post-earthquake fires; Progressive collapse; Travelling fires; Fire resistance",,,,"University of Manchester","The authors acknowledge the support of The Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) for the financial support that made this work possible.

Vertical supports provided by protected beams along the edge of slab panels play an important role in the development of the tensile membrane action. The present study investigates the effect of fire insulation delamination on protected beams, as might occur in an earthquake, on the fire resistance of composite floors subject to fire following an earthquake. The results show that fire insulation delamination considerably reduces the development of tensile membrane action. Based on the results obtained, two methods of improvement are presented to enhance the development of tensile membrane action concurrent with fire insulation delamination. It is found that increasing slab thickness and improving fire protection rating can enhance the fire resistance of the whole building even with fire insulation delamination. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Composite building; Fire engineering; Fire insulation; Post-earthquake fire; Tensile membrane action","Earthquakes; Fire protection; Floors; Insulation; Membranes; Composite buildings; Fire engineering; Fire insulation; Post-earthquake fires; Tensile membrane action; Fire resistance",,,,"University of Manchester","The authors acknowledge the support of The Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) for the financial support that made this work possible.

However, most design approaches do not consider fire following earthquake as a specific loading case. Moreover, seismic design philosophies allow a certain degree of damage in structural elements which make structures more vulnerable when subjected to post-earthquake fire. This study uses three-dimensional numerical models to investigate the effect of earthquake damage on the fire resistance of composite steel-frame office buildings. A total of two types of earthquake damage, fire insulation delamination and residual lateral frame deformation, are investigated. It is concluded that earthquake damage can significantly reduce the fire resistance of composite buildings, with delamination of fire protection having the greatest effect. The results of this study can be used by designers to improve the post-earthquake fire resistance of composite buildings. © The Author(s) 2018.","composite construction; earthquake engineering; fire engineering; fire following earthquake; fire insulation","Concrete slabs; Delamination; Earthquake engineering; Fire protection; Fire resistance; Office buildings; Philosophical aspects; Seismic design; Steel construction; Structural frames; Composite buildings; Composite construction; Earthquake loadings; Fire engineering; Fire insulation; Post-earthquake fires; Structural elements; Three-dimensional numerical models; Earthquakes",,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This PhD research was funded by the Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP).","(2014) ABAQUS/Standard Analysis User’s Manual v14.2, , Johnston, RI, SIMULIA; Ali, F., O’Connor, D., Structural performance of rotationally restrained steel columns in fire (2001) Fire Safety Journal, 36, pp. 679-691; Arablouei, A., Kodur, V., Dynamic delamination of fire insulation applied on steel structures under impact loading (2015) International Journal of Impact Engineering, 83, pp. 11-27; (2007) Seismic Rehabilitation of Existing Buildings (ASCE/SEI 41-06), , Reston, VA: ASCE; (1996) Seismic Evaluation and Retrofit of Concrete Building (ATC-40), , Redwood City, CA: Applied Technology Council; Behnam, B., Ronagh, H.R., Post-earthquake fire performance-based behavior of unprotected moment resisting 2D steel frames (2015) KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering, 19, pp. 274-284; Braxtan, N.L., Pessiki, S.P., Postearthquake fire performance of sprayed fire-resistive material on steel moment frames (2011) Journal of Structural Engineering, 137, pp. 946-953; Bruneau, M., Uang, C.-M., Whittaker, A., (1997) Ductile Design of Steel Structures, , USA, McGraw-Hill Professional; (2002) Eurocode 1: actions on structures – part 1–1: general actions – densities, self-weight, imposed loads for buildings (EN 1991-1-1), , (, a; (2002) Eurocode 1: actions on structures – part 1–2: general actions.

The aim of this study is to provide insight into the effect of prior earthquake damage on structural behaviour in fire. It compares structural behaviour of the frame in two different conditions, Fire in normal conditions (F) and Post-Earthquake Fire (PEF). The earthquake analysis is performed using pushover analysis and then is followed by fire analysis using the Eurocode parametric fire. Additionally the effect of fire insulation delamination during earthquake is also taken into account. The contrast in behaviour of the two conditions is presented and explained. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"3D modeling; Earthquakes; Steel beams and girders; Steel structures; Structural analysis; Structural frames; 3-D numerical modeling; Earthquake analysis; Earthquake damages; Normal condition; Parametric fires; Post-earthquake fires; Push-over analysis; Structural behaviour; Fires",,,,,,"Scawthorn, C., Eidinger, J., Schiff, A., (2005) Fire Following Earthquake.

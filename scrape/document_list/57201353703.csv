Using mixed methodology between qualitative and quantitative, this research aims to overview the architecture, interior and some famous food that people remember about Metropole XXI building in Jakarta. The research found that some architecture and interior elements are among of what people remember about Metropole XXI as nostalgic reason that could help for future research on preserving this building as one of the oldest and well maintain historical building in Jakarta.

The research for this paper includes interviews with the founder of Sekar Kawung foundation, literature reviews, photographs, social media reports and community summaries. Sui Utik, in collaboration with Sekar Kawung, has developed creative works including weavings, an innovative application of tattoos, food and beverage products, and eco treks. The research found that the Sui Utik community, which started producing creative works in 2015, have continued their practice as social entrepreneurs. It is suggested that they should now expand their practice by working together with other indigenous entrepreneurs to challenge Indonesian craftsmen and designers to take their creativity, skills and knowledge to an international market. As part of this move, the development of innovative marketing tools using new technologies should be explored, while maintaining local wisdom as the core value for making creative works. © 2020.","Biodiversity; Creative works; Culture; Dayak Iban; Indonesia; Kalimantan; Local wisdom; Sekar Kawung; Sui Utik; Tembawang",,,,,,"I would like to thank Mrs Chandra Kirana from Sekar Kawung foundation for our conversations and her encouragement; and Darren Whiteside, Aji Yahuti and Sumarni (Youth_actkalimantan/Ranu Welum Foundation) for their support for this paper.","Aaberge, B., Barnard, T., Greer, S., Henry, R., Designs on the Future: Aboriginal Painted Shields and Baskets of Tropical North Queensland, Australia (2014) ETropic, 13 (2), pp. 56-74. , https://doi.org/10.25120/etropic.13Th2014.3314; Ananda, M., (2019) Children, , Palangkaraya: Ranu Welum Foundation and Youth_actkalimantan; Anderson, J., (2002) Priority Areas for Rattan Conservation on Borneo, , University of Copenhagen; (2019) Antaranews, , https://en.antaranews.com/news/133398/indonesian-forest-fire-chokes-millions-of-people-animals, (October 5); Ave, J., Hitchcock, M., Jay, S.E., Gustami, S.P., (2008) Indonesian Arts and Crafts, , Jakarta: BAB Publishing Indonesia; Baral, H., Jaung, W., Bhatta, L.D., Phuntsho, S., Sharma, S., Paudyal, K., Zarandian, A., Artati, Y., Approaches and tools for assessing mountain forest ecosystem services (2017) Working Paper, 235, , https://doi.org/10.17528/cifor/006755, Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); Brookes, S., Life in a Longhouse Sungai Utik Village (2018) NOW!, , http://nowjakarta.co.id/art-and-culture/hidden-heritage/life-in-a-longhouse-sungai-utik-village, (3 April); Damkar, C.K., (2019) Forest fires in Central Kalimantan, , Palangkaraya: Ranu Welum Foundation; El-Haggar, S.M., (2007) Sustainable Industrial Design and Waste Management: Cradle-to-cradle for Sustainable Development, , https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-373623-9.X5000-X, Academic Press; Foresta, H.D., Michon, G., The agroforesta alternative to Imperata grasslands: When smallhorlder agriculture and forestry reach sustainability (1997) Agroforestry Systems, 36, pp. 105-120; (2019) Greeners, , www.greeners.co, (June 25); Idhom, A.M., Causes and Effects of Forest Fires in Kalimantan to Sumatra (2019) Tirto, , https://tirto.id/penyebab-dan-akibat-kebakaran-hutan-di-kalimantan-hingga-sumatera-eic3, (17 September); (2019) Kalbar Litbag Pertanian, , http://kalbar.litbang.pertanian.go.id, (June 25); Kirana, C., (2015) Jungle Trek, , Sui Utik: Sekar Kawung; Kirana, C., (2015) Natural Mat, , Sui Utik: Sekar Kawung; Kirana, C., (2015) Wild Mango, , Sui Utik: Sekar Kawung; Kirana, C., (2019) Personal Communication, , July 12 & 18.

Surrounded by crystal water and microclimate tropical weather. Nowadays, modern materials for building in Gili become choices due to the access from suppliers from the big islands surroundings. The use of indigenous materials such as bamboo become rare for wall, ceiling and roof. However, bamboo is a promising choice for cooling down the interior thermal of the building and considered as a sustainable building material. The project is designed as a sustainable architecture for boutique villa that aims to attract tourist by its concept of holistic design and to embrace bamboo as indigenous local material for sustainable holistic design. This journal focused on bamboo for wall, ceiling, roof and shading as design elements to create thermally comfortable interior of the villa. It uses a research by method of implementing research bamboo that has been done by other researchers and site observation, observing the type of bamboo and designing the holistic architecture. The research found that the use of bamboo with holistic approach for the wall, ceiling, roof and shading with the understanding of the nature will be promising with further research needed to create thermally comfortable interior environment. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

However, even though it a sustainable resource, many people considered Bamboo as outcast material for furniture because of its appearance. Evidently, the use of bamboo is often used to make simple tools with similar traditional designs for everyday life. The tradition of using bamboo was not further explored with respect to the ongoing development of creative design and function in the era of today's modern technology. In retrospect to the above issues, this study is aimed to introduce the used of bamboo for material furniture in disaster and remote areas in Indonesia to increases their quality of life. It uses a research by a method of collecting data through surveys, literature review, interviews and training to determine the types of bamboo used for material furniture in disaster and remote territories. The results of this study is intended to show that the use of bamboo can be further developed into furniture for disaster and remote territory to create higher values of the products and increase the quality of life. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Disasters; Creative design; Furniture design; Literature reviews; Modern technologies; Quality of life; Remote areas; Sustainable materials; Sustainable resources; Bamboo",,,,,,"Sonjaya, J.A., (2014) Kumpulan Materi Pelatihan Bambu.

The plant has multiple uses and can re-generate by itself ensuring its continuity to meet ongoing needs. However, the tradition of using bamboo is not further explored in respect to the progressive development of creative design and function in the era of today’s modern technology. Evidently, the use of bamboo in rural areas is often used to make simple tools with similar traditional designs for everyday life. In retrospect to the above issues, this study is aimed to introduce the used of bamboo for material furniture in rural area in Indonesia. It uses a research by method of collecting data through surveys, literature review, interviews and training to determine the types of bamboo use for material furniture in rural area. The results of this study is intended to show that the use of bamboo can be further developed into furniture for rural areas to create higher values. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Bamboo; Characteristic of bamboo; Material furniture; Rural area",,,,,,"Acknowledgment submitted to Binus University for supporting the writing of this paper and hopefully this paper can be useful for the readers and contributed to the development of bamboo furniture in Indonesia.","Larasati, D., (1999) Uncovering the Green Gold of Indonesia: A Design Research on Bamboo’s Potential, 65p; Sonjaya, J.A., (2014) Bamboo Workshop Paper Collection UGM Centre of Asia Pacific Studies and Bambubos, Yogjakarta, pp. 9-24; Sulastiningsih, I.M., Santoso, A., (2012) Jurnal Penelitian Hasil Hutan, 30, p. 199; Arinasa, I.B.K., Peneng, D.I.N., (2013) Jenis-Jenis Bambu Di Bali Dan Potensinya, , LIPI Press, Jakarta; Sofiana, Y., Octaviana, R.C., (2014) Kajian Teknis Pengolahan Material Bambu Menjadi Material Siap Pakai Bagi Industri Desain, , Research Report Grant, Binus University, Jakarta; Sulastiningsih, I.M., Dan Krisdianto, A.S., (2014) Pembuatan Produk Bambu Komposit, , Pusat penelitian dan pengembangan keteknikan kehutanan dan pengolahan hasil hutan.

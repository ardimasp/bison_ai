The growth of the population in Jakarta is increased rapidly. The wage that Many transportations are causing a traffic jam in Jakarta. The government suggests that people use public transportation for their mobility. However, people choose to use their vehicles rather than public transportation. The main reason is that public transportation cannot guarantee the arriving time, whether it is on time or not. Many people move on to online transportation services. However, the massive growth of online transportation is still a contradiction as public transportation. People in Jakarta need faster mobility to go. This research is trying to make a system for public transport without any delay and hard to use it. This problem can be solved by building a new system. This system required e-wallet for payment in public transportation. This E-Wallet will search the possible route from the nearest location to the destination - only the public transport where there is a station that can use it. By using QR-Code generated by e-wallet on the mobile phone, people can scan it directly to a machine located in the station. This method will make a transaction faster than ever. Moreover, people can enjoy another feature like cashback and redeem the prize by a point system. In this era, e-commerce is dominating the market for purchasing something. This is also the attraction of the system. This system is also required excellent facilities from the government so that people can enjoy it. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Population statistics; Traffic congestion; E-payments; Jakarta; Public transport; Public transportation; QR codes; Traffic jams; Transportation services; Electronic money",,,,,"Gershenson, C., Pineda, L., Why Does Public Transport Not Arrive on Time? the Pervasiveness of Equal Headway Instability (2009) PLoS ONE, 4 (10), p. e7292; Yudhistira, M., Koesrindartono, D., Harmadi, S., Pratama, A., How Congested Jakarta is?

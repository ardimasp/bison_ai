Earthquake resistant design is generally based on an analysis of elastic structures that are given a load factor to simulate ultimate conditions. When an earthquake occurs, the collapse behavior of a building structure is inelastic. Evaluations that can estimate the inelastic condition of buildings during an earthquake are analyzed using pushover analysis. Pushover analysis is the nonlinear static load of the structural collapse behavior of an earthquake, while the performance point is the magnitude of the maximum displacement of the structure during a earthquake. The inelastic structure analysis and evaluation method used computer application SAP 2000. Evaluation results of structural performance levels according to Applied Technology Council 40 (ATC-40) on the X and Y direction structure, the maximum total drift and total inelastic drift maximum values in the X and Y directions included in the Immediate Occupancy (IO) level category (maximum drift value of a building structure 0.00047 < 0.005). © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","pushover analysis; reinforced concrete; seismic performance","Earthquake engineering; Reinforced concrete; Seismic waves; Structural analysis; Earthquake-resistant design; Inelastic structure; Maximum displacement; Performance points; Push-over analysis; Seismic Performance; Structural collapse; Structural performance; Earthquakes",,,,,"(1996) Seismic Evaluation and Retrofit of Concrete Building, 1. , Applied Technology Council 40; Yosafat Aji, P., Evaluasi Kinerja Gedung Beton Bertulang Tahan Gempa dengan Pushove Analysis (Sesuai ATC-40, FEMA 356, dan FEMA 440) (2006) Jurnal Teknik Sipil, 3; (2007) NEHRP Recommended Provisions for Seismic Regulations for New Buildings and Other Structures (FEMA 451B), , Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); (2012) Standar Perencanaan Ketahanan Gempa Untuk Struktur Bangunan Gedung, , Badan Standardisasi Nasional; (2013) Beban Minimum Untuk Perancangan Bangunan Gedung Dan Struktur Lain, , Badan Standardisasi Nasional; (2013) Persyaratan Beton Struktural Untuk Bangunan Gedung, , Badan Standardisasi Nasional; Hizkia Yehezkiel, M., Wallah Steenie, E., Reky Stenly, W., Analisis Pushover Pada Bangunan Dengan Soft First Story (2014) Jurnal Sipil Statik, 2; Fu-Pei, H., Yusak, O., Yu-Chen, O., A Pushover Seismic Analysis Method for Asymmetric and Tall Buildings (2015) Journal of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, 38","Hidayat, I.; Civil Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: irpan@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Nowadays in a higher education institution, learning has become a complex social activity that needs more understanding of up to date trend of industries' practice because when university students graduated, they are expected to meet the standard qualification of industry. To find suitable learning partner from industry or other higher education institution is not easy. it requires connection with many partners, and the competency of learning part-ners must match with learning topics so that they can collaborate in the learning process. This study focuses on exploring how to make learning partner recommender generators that can provide suggestions for higher education institutions according to courses and course topics using information gathered from the social media platform. The results of this study are modules of a recommender system that can gather required information on learning partners from social media platforms. The modules are important for the information of learning partner's experience and skill use for making the recommender system grouping according to courses and course topics in the social learning platform of higher education institutions. © 2020 ICIC International.

Presumably, a demand emerges in assessing students’ achievement by using technology. In language teaching learning, it is undeniable that the technology is also applied in assessing students’ language skills including writing. In assessing writing, in a common type, the process is carried out manually or typed in a word document. Based on the results, this research aims to explain the development of an integrated multimedia website for assessing writing and the potential of using the website for writing test. Questionnaires were distributed to 28 students joining English Professional Course at BINUS Online Learning to evaluate the promptness of the website for the test and the students’ sense of the website functionality. The result denoted that the website contribution is well-equipped to use as a tool and to test the writing skill. Moreover, the users were comfortable to exert it for undertaking the writing test. Equally important, the developments on the website require continuous improvement, especially for the variation of the questions including to add video and audio integration eventually. © 2018 ACM.","ESL; Integrated-multimedia; Technology; Website; Writing test","E-learning; Surveys; Teaching; Websites; Continuous improvements; High technology; Integrated-multimedia; Language teachings; Online learning; Teaching-learning; Word documents; Writing skills; Students",,,,"Binus University","The study is supported by BINUS University Grant.","Yunus, M., The use of information and communication technology (ict) in teaching esl writing skills (2013) English Language Teaching, 6 (7). , http://edtech2.boisestate.edu/williamstewart287/512/module5/assets/TheUseOfICTInTeachingWritingYunusetal2013.pdf, 2013.

A number of companies have built sophisticated system to fulfill operational. To maximize the benefit of the system, the data has to be stored in database for long time period so it can be used for analysis in the future. There are many models Database Management System (DBMS) architecture that can be applied, one of them are NoSQL architecture. NoSQL and relational model are two models that are very different. Relational model concept store data in the table, which consists of column and row. Each table interconnected by using foreign key (FK) which is an attribute. When the developer wants to consolidate data from all existing table, then the developer must combine a table with another table, through a foreign key that has defined in the first time, so it can certainly be combined data. Nowadays it’s often be problem for a developer, given the massive data growth, with a fairly high degree of scalability that will be very difficult for a developer to provide the required data in a short time. Therefore, NoSQL approach comes as a solution. In NoSQL, data will be stored in the form of documents and data integration will be done using programming language format. Each document can be likened to a programming language object that can be used in applications that are built. So that access to the data can be done efficiently and effectively despite the huge amount of data.

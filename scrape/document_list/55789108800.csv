The diseases monitored by this study were diabetes, hypertension and tuberculosis. Data were collected through interviews with the company's human resources department and occupational health provider. As for the model, literature and online research were conducted to collect health standards and information system standards on existing DisMan systems. These standards were then compared to the consumer electronics manufacturer's DisMan. The model was designed by utilizing class, use-case, as well as sequence diagrams. The result was an information system model with a registry system that can specifically support DisMan in a consumer electronics manufacturer. The registry system included a medical alert management system and a self-monitoring system. The latter system was supported by the former system, which can assist the DisMan's staff in monitoring the employees' scrupulousness regarding their health care plan as well as notifying the employees on lifestyle management. © 2013 Science Publication.","Alert management system; Disease management; Information system model; Medical care plan; Self-monitoring",,,,,,"Aiko, H., Domestic Violence (1995) Japanese Women: New Feminist Perspectives On the Past, Present and Future, pp. 265-267. , Fujimura-Fanselow, K. and A.

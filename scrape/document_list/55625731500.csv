Its purpose was to determine the correlation between independent variables consisting of Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Attitude toward Using (AU) with dependent variable Behavioral Intention to Use (BIU). Data collection techniques were carried out by distributing questionnaires through group discussion forums. Respondents consisted of medical workers and health cadres both in Jakarta and Yogyakarta. Data were analyzed using correlation test and t-test. The results of the correlation test state that the correlation between PEU and AU is 0.30, which shows a weak correlation. Meanwhile, the correlation of PU and AU is 0.56, PEU and BIU is 0.41, and PU and BIU is 0.47, which are considered as moderate correlations. Finally, a strong correlation exists between AU and BIU. T-test results show that the effect of PU on AU is statistically significant with CI = 95%. Likewise, the effects of PEU on AU, AU towards BIU, PU towards BIU, and PEU towards BIU are significant (p < 0.05). © Kassel University Press GmbH.","Cancer early detection; Mobile learning; TAM",,,,,,,,"Dyanti, G.A.R., Suariyani, N.L.P., Faktor-Faktor Keterlambatan Penderita Kanker Payudara Dalam Melakukan Pemeriksaan Awal Ke Pelayanan Kesehatan (2016) Jurnal Kesehatan Masyarakat, 11 (2), pp. 96-104. , https://doi.org/10.15294/kemas.v11i2.3742; Muljo, H.H., Perbangsa, A.S., Pardamean, B., Assessment of Online Learning Application for Health Education (2019) International Journal of Online and Biomedical Engineering, 15 (12), pp. 69-80. , https://doi.org/10.3991/ijoe.v15i12.11157; Setiati, E., (2009) Waspadai Empat Kanker Ganas Pembunuh Wanita, Kanker Rahim, Kanker Indung Telur, Kanker Leher Rahim, Kanker Payudara, , https://doi.org/10.18860/sains.v0i0.1862, Yokyakarta: Andi; Fernández, M.E., DeBor, M., Candreia, J.D.M., Dissemination of a breast and cervical cancer early detection program through a network of community-based organizations (2010) Health Promotion Practice, 11 (5), pp. 654-664. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839908325064; Ngoc Nguyen, T.-U., Tanjasiri, S.P., Kagawa-Singer, M., Tran, J.H., Foo, M.A., Community Health Navigators for Breast-and Cervical-Cancer Screening Among Cambodian and Laotian Women: Intervention Strategies and Relationship-Building Processes (2008) Health Promotion Practice, 9 (4), pp. 356-367. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839906290251; Muljo, H.H., Pardamean, B., Perbangsa, A.S., The implementation of online learning for early detection of cervical cancer (2017) Journal of Computer Science, 13 (11), pp. 600-607. , https://doi.org/10.3844/jcssp.2017.600.607; Davis, F.D., Perceived Usefullness, Perceived Ease of Use, and User Acceptance of Information Technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3). , https://doi.org/10.2307/249008; Quinn, C., (2000) MLearning, , Mobile, Wireless, In-Your-Pocket Learning.

For automation, an intelligent system needs to be developed. However, an intelligent system needs to be trained in a large dataset before it can be used reliably. In this paper, we present a transfer learning scheme to develop an intelligent system for smart building management system. Specifically, the intelligent system is able to count human inside a room, which can be utilized to adaptively adjust energy usage in a room. The transfer learning scheme employs a deep learning model that is pretrained on ImageNet dataset. To enable the human counting capability, the model is trained on a dataset specifically collected for human counting case. © 2019, The Author(s).","Building management system; Deep learning; Human counting;

The data analysis method used in this research is panel data regression analysis using E-views version 10. Based on the results of partial test, profitability and audit firm size have significant effect on audit delay. Company size, liquidity, and solvency do not have a significant effect on audit delay. Simultaneous test result showed that company size, liquidity, profitability, solvability, and audit firm size simultaneously affect audit delay. The results of this study indicate that if the auditor wants to minimize audit delay, they must pay more attention to clients' profitability and consider the size of the company, the size of the audit's scope of work. © BEIESP.","Audit Firm Size; Company size; Liquidity; Profitability; Solvability",,,,,,,,"McKinnie, M., (2016) Cloud Computing: TOE Adoption Factors by Service Model in Manufacturing,”, p. 131; Kieso, T.D.D.E., (2011) J.

Japanese language characteristics bring its own challenge in morphological analysis due to the uniqueness of Japanese grammatical system. By the rapid development of NLP tools, many Japanese NLP tools developed with limited ability yet specialized in running certain preprocessing methods. In this paper, the compilation of various methods and newly discovered tools for preprocess Japanese text are delivered to help people decide which Japanese NLP tools needs to be utilized to run some preprocessing methods. All of the Japanese preprocessing methods and tools are collected through literature review. It is concluded that depending on one NLP tool is not recommended since combination of Japanese NLP tools is required to finish Japanese preprocessing phase. © 2019 IEEE.","Japanese; Methods; Natural Language Processing; Preprocessing; Tools","Classification (of information); Information management; Text processing; Tools; Japanese; Methods; Morphological analysis; NAtural language processing; Pre-processing method; Preprocessing; Preprocessing phase; Text classification; Natural language processing systems",,,,,,,"Tanaka, T., Masaaki, N., (2015) Word-based Japanese Typed Dependency Parsing with Grammatical Function Analysis, pp. 237-242; Kitagawa, Y., Komachi, M., Long Short-Term Memory for Japanese Word Segmentation.; Shibata, D., Wakamiya, S., Aramaki, E., (2016) Detecting Japanese Patients with Alzheimer ' S Disease Based on Word Category Frequencies, pp. 78-85; Nio, L., Murakami, K., Intelligence is asking the right question: A study on Japanese question generation (2018) SLT, pp. 771-778; Nio, L., Murakami, K., Combination of statistical and neural approaches in the Japanese question generation system (2019) The Association for Natural Language Processing, pp. 1379-1382; (2010) Japanese Ministry of Education and A. of C.

Where, if the KM concept focuses on creating knowledge and innovations sourced from within the organization, the CKM focuses on the consumer's perspective as a trigger for the creation and improvement of innovation. In other words, CKM builds two-way communication between companies and consumers, with the aim of accelerating knowledge creation.

The development of health knowledge can be disseminated by utilizing mobile application based learning technology as media. Many things have been done by the government through special programs, among others, carried out breast cancer awareness campaign through breast self-screening program. The positive impact of this effort has led to mobile applications for learning about early detection of cancer in Indonesia. The development of mobile learning is a continuation of previous online learning to help the process of early detection of cervical cancer. Data collection methods used observation, interview, and questionnaire techniques, while instructional designs use the ADDIE (Analysis Design Development Implementation Evaluations) model and methods for developing object-oriented programming systems using Unified Modeling Language (UML). The resulting output is the application of early detection of cancer-based mobile learning which is the virtue of this study. © 2018, International Association of Online Engineering.","Cancer; Early detection; Mobile learning",,,,,,,,"Huang, Y.-M., Hwang, W.-Y., Chang, K.-E., Guest Editorial-Innovations in Designing Mobile Learning Applications (2010) Educational Technology & Society, 13 (3), pp. 1-2; Spector, J.M., (2013) Foundations of educational technology: Integrative approaches and interdisciplinary perspectives, , Routledge; Quinn, C.N., (2011) Designing mLearning: Tapping into the mobile revolution for organizational performance, p. 256. , San Francisco: Pfeiffer; Alsaadat, K., Mobile Learning and University Teaching (2009) International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN09), , Barcelona, Spain; Vinu, P.V., Sherimon, P.C., Krishnan, R., 'Towards pervasive mobile learning-the vision of 21st century' (2011) Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, 15, pp. 3067-3073. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.04.247; Yuen, S., Wang, S., M-learning: Mobility in Learning (2004) Proceedings of E-Learn 2004-World Conference on E-Learning in Corporate, Government, Healthcare, and Higher Education, pp. 2248-2252. , In J.

However, there are numerous difficulties in maintaining a reliable KM system. One of the challenges is to manage knowledge materials in video format. A video file contains complex data that lead to the difficulties in managing them. Without an intelligent system, managing videos for KM requires a laborious effort. In this paper, an intelligent framework for KM system, embedded with deep learning model, is proposed. The use of the deep learning model alleviates the heavy burden of video materials management in KM system. To enhance the agility of the system, mobile-based deep learning model is utilized in the framework. © 2018, International Association of Online Engineering.","Deep learning; Knowledge management; Mobile-based; Video classification",,,,,"Binus University","This study was supported by Artificial Intelligence Research & Development Center of Bina Nusantara University.",,"Birzniece, I., Artificial Intelligence in Knowledge Management: Overview and Trends (2011) Scientific Journal of Riga Technical University, 6, pp. 5-11. , https://doi.org/10.2478/v10143-011-0001-x; Zhang, Z.J., Jasimuddin, S.M., A model-based analysis for mobile knowledge management in organizations (2015) Journal of Management Analytics, 2 (1), pp. 35-52. , https://doi.org/10.1080/23270012.2015.1012232; LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., Hinton, G., Deep learning (2015) Nature, 521 (7553), pp. 436-444. , https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14539; Carreira, J., Zisserman, A., Quo Vadis, Action Recognition?

But in some activities, such as the management of research, the utilization is still not felt. So the implementation process within the scope of research management at universities is not easy and tends to be slow. The purpose of this study is to determine what features that are needed for the research grants management system and its relationship with the research university roadmap. Research and design that are done in this study focus on designing a model of management information systems research grants. The study was conducted by interviewing and distributing questionnaires to several researchers and managers of research grants in Jakarta, and comparing with literature review. The study also used Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) with Unified Modeling Language notation to design the model. The result of this research is a model of management information systems research grants, which are designed to support operational activities, including the submission, assessment, monitoring, final reporting, and reporting to management and following the university research roadmap as the main contribution of this research. © 2016 IEEE.","management information system; research grant management; web-based system","Computer software; Information systems; Life cycle; Management information systems; Modeling languages; Software design; Surveys; Unified Modeling Language; Websites; Implementation process; Operational activity; Research grants; Research universities; Software development life cycle; University research; Web based information technology; Web-based system; Information management",,,,,,,"(2013) Terms and Conditions of Research Council FEC Grants, , http//www.rcuk.ac.uk/RCUK-prod/assets/documents/documents/tcfec.pdf, Research Council UK,[Accessed 12 March 2016],rfsti October; Tauginiene, L., The roles of a research administrator at a university (2009) Viešoji Politika Ir Administravimas, (30), pp. 45-56; Mitchell, H.M., (2008) Grants Management 101: Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Grants, , https//www2.massgeneral.org/mgpa/docs/Mary%20Mitchell%20Grants%20Management%20101.pdf, 1 January ,[Accessed 12 March 2016]; Kaplan, N., The role of the research administrator (1959) Administrative Science Quarterly, 4, pp. 20-42; Bowonder, B., The research manager and his roles (1980) Journal of the Society of, 12 (1); (2014) Guide of Applicants, , http//erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/info_for_applicants_adg_2014.pdf, European Research Council,[Accessed 2016 March 12],June; Pope, E., (2013) A Consumers Guide to Grants Management Systems, , http//smartsimple.com/images/brochures/Idealware%27s-A-Consumers-Guide-to-Grants-Management-Software-2013-Excerpt.pdf, November ,[Accessed 12 3 2016]; Fernandes, F., Song, M., UML-checker: An approach for verifying UML behavioral diagrams (2014) Journal of Software, 9 (5), pp. 1229-1236; Ferrante, S., Bonacina, S., Pinciroli, F., (2013) Modeling Stroke Rehabilitation Processes Using the Unified Modeling Language (UML), , Elsevier; Satzinger, J.W., Jackson, R.B., Burd, S.D., (2009) Systems Analysis and Design in A Changing World, , Cengage, Boston; Ruparelia, N.B., Software development lifecycle models (2010) ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes, pp. 8-13; Whitten, J.L., Bentley, L.D., (2007) Systems Anlysis and Design Methods, , New York: McGraw-Hill; O'Brien, J.A., Marakas, G., (2009) Management Information System, , Boston: McGraw-Hill",,,"BINUS Univerity;IEEE Indonesia Section;Wiley","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2016","16 November 2016 through 18 November 2016",,127842,,9781509033522,,,"English","Proc.

Studies show that TBL can provide opportunities in developing teamwork capabilities and enhancing active learning, which are effects that could remedy the weaknesses of implementing blended learning. A blended teaching portfolio was developed for an International Human Resource Management course that consisted of a course overview, graduate competency, a syllabus, course material resources, a teaching scenario, a reading assurance test, midterm/final exams, student assignments, assessment of learning outcomes, and a course quality improvement sheet. Each item was constructed based on the characteristics of the course. The portfolio was considered a valuable tool for lecturers to manage a blended-learning course that can help students in achieving higher scores and in motivating them to read course materials prior to class sessions.","E-learning; Face to Face; In Person; Learning Management System; Online Learning; Readiness Assurance Process; Syllabus; Team Based Learning",,,,,,,,"Alebaikan, R., Troudi, S., Blended learning in Saudi universities: Challenges and perspectives (2010) ALT-J.

Its purpose is to improve competitive advantage among hospitals through the addition of new services and products that would lead to improvements in the current patient services. The merging of Hospital Information System (HIS), Radiology Information System (RIS), and Laboratory Information System (LIS) into a single network with a concept of telemedicine is the main topic of this article. The hospital's website is also developed with medical tourism in mind, which attracts more patients, generating more revenue for the hospital. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","hospital information systems; medical tourism; strategic planning; telemedicine","Competitive advantage; Hospital information systems; Laboratory information system; medical tourism; New services; Patient services; Radiology information system; Single networks; Communication; Competition; Information systems; Radiology; Strategic planning; Telemedicine; Hospitals",,,,,,,"Henderson, J.C., Sifonis, J.G., The Value of Strategic IS Planning: Understanding, Consistency, Validity, and IS Markets (1988) MIS Quarterly, 12, pp. 186-200; Adams, J., Successful Strategic Planning: Creating Clarity (2005) Journal of Healthcare Information Management, 19, p. 3; Hartog, C., Herbert, M., Opinion Survey of MIS mManagers: Key Issues (1985) MIS Quarterly, 12, p. 4; Porter, M.E., (1985) Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance, , Free Press, New York; Earl, M.J., (1989) Management Strategies for Information Systems Planning, , Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs; Wagnera, S.M., Johnson, J.L., Configuring and Managing Strategic Supplier Portfolios (2004) Industrial Marketing Management, 33, pp. 717-730; Davis, A., Olson, E.M., Critical Competitive Strategy Issues Every Entrepreneur should Consider before Going into Business (2008) Business Horizons, 51, pp. 211-221; Ward, J., Peppard, J., (2002) Strategic Planning for Information System, , 2nd edn.

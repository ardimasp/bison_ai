This device also includes an ultrasonic sensor for measuring the water level within the diffuser's tank by calculating the distance between the sensor and the water below it, RGB-enabled LED lighting, and an audio player that can play relaxing natural sounds for the user. The research method is comprised of problem identification, literature review, system development, implementation, and evaluation. This device can achieve the objective of being able to be operated through MQTT using an Android smartphone to control all components within the system with an average response time of 731.91 milliseconds and being able to measure the water level within the diffuser's tank with a typical accuracy of 99.26% during testing. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Android; aromatherapy; ESP8266; Internet of Things; MQTT; ultrasonic sensor; water monitoring","Audio acoustics; Internet of things; Microcontrollers; Smartphones; Tanks (containers); Ultrasonic sensors; Water levels; Android; Aromatherapy; ESP8266; MQTT; Water monitoring; Android (operating system)",,,,,"Chamine, I., Oken, B.S., Expectancy of Stress-Reducing Aromatherapy Effect and Performance on a Stress-Sensitive Cognitive Task (2015) Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine, 2015; Warowna, M., Hordyjewska, A., Sobolewska-Samorek, A., Krȩcisz, B., The Use of Aromatherapy and Music Therapy as a Relaxing Factor in a Beauty Salon (2019) European Journal of Medical Technologies, 1, pp. 25-33; Aromatherapy Diffusers Market Analysis by Product (Ultrasonic, Nebulizer, Evaporative, Heat), by Region (North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, MEA, Central & South America) and Segment Forecasts, 2018-2025 (2017) Grand View Research, , Grand View Research; (2016) Internet of Things (IoT) Connected Devices Installed Base Worldwide from 2015 to 2025 (In Billions), , IHS Markit; Suresh, P., Daniel, J.V., Parthasarathy, V., A state of the art review on the Internet of Things (IoT) (2014) 2014 International Conference on Science, Engineering and Management Research, 2014; Perumal, T., Sulaiman, N., Leong, C.Y., Internet of Things (IoT) Enabled Water Monitoring System (2015) 2015 IEEE 4th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics, pp. 86-87; Zhmud, V.A., Kondratiev, N.O., Kuznetsov, K.A., Trubin, V.G., Dimitrov, L.V., Application of ultrasonic sensor for measuring distances in robotics (2018) International Conference Information Technologies in Business and Industry 2018, 1015; Shinde, S., Nimkar, P., Singh, S., Salpe, V., Jadhav, Y., MQTT-Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (2016) International Conference on Research and Recent Trends in Engineering and Technology, 3, pp. 240-244; Kodali, R.K., Soratkal, S., MQTT based Home Automation System Using ESP8266 (2016) 2016 IEEE Region 10 Humanitarian Technology Conference, 2016","Hutabarat, D.P.; Computer Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: dhutabarat@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

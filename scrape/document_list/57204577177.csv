Questionnaires were distributed to 384 respondents who were users of one of the top five e-marketplaces in Indonesia. Data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and processed using SmartPLS. This research model describes 80.50% of online consumer behavior, where there are several factors, namely seller's reputation, trust in market-maker, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived risk, after sales services, customer services, trust in the seller, and product quality. It can be concluded that the seller's reputation factor is a factor that must be prioritized in increasing online consumer behavior. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","E-Marketplace; Indonesia; Online Consumer Behavior; SEM; SmartPLS",,,,,,"Basri, F., (2017) Pertumbuhan Pengguna Internet, Indonesia Nomor 1 Di Dunia, , https://databoks.katadata.co.id/datapublish/2017/05/22/pertumbuhan-penggunainternet-indonesia-nomor-1-di-dunia, Katadata.Co.Id; Librianty, A., (2017) Ini 10 Toko Online Terbaik Di Indonesia, , http://tekno.liputan6.com/read/3068210/ini-10-toko-online-terbaik-di-indonesia, Tekno.Liputan6.Com; Katadata, A., Enter, T., Katadata, T.P., (2017) INFOGRAFIK: Indonesia, Pusat Ecommerce ASEAN, , http://katadata.co.id/infografik/2016/01/04/indonesia-pusat-e-commerce-asean, Katadata.Co.Id; Meents, S., (2009) The Influence of Sellers and the Intermediary on Buyers Trust in C2C Electronic marketplaces,�?, p. 316; Fajar, N.K., Sandhyaduhita, P.I., Supporting factors of sellers reputation in e-marketplace: A case of Indonesia,�?

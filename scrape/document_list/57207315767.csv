FMEA is widely used in a design, a manufacturing or assembly process, or a product and service for identifying all possible failures. Risk identification is part of risk management. Therefore it is a critical first step of it. This paper is a case study on XYZ University which trying to implement risk management which only focused on how to identify the risk using FMEA. FMEA needs some parameters to be defined which are severity values, the likelihood of occurrence, and detection. Risk Priority Number (RPN) is a matrix that indicates potential risk calculated by multiplying the three components, and it used to classify which should be taken care of first based on the highest RPN value. Filtering the ticketing system and mapped the incidents that happened to the current business process is how the data collected, also the interview to end user for validation. The result of this paper is astonishing because it is different from the initial expectation that business process like LMS or network facility will get the highest RPN value, but after doing all the process, it is found that telecommunication is at the top. Surely this provides a new perspective to risk management to be slicker in handling potential one. © 2019, Insight Society.","Educational; Failure mode effect analysi; FMEA; Risk; Risk management",,,,,,"Antonio, B., Gaudenzi, B., (2013) Risk Management, , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-88-470-2531-8; Wickboldt, J.A., Bianchin, L.A., Lunardi, R.C., Granville, L.Z., Gaspary, L.P., Bartolini, C., A framework for risk assessment based on an analysis of historical information of workflow execution in IT systems (2011) Computer Networks, 55 (13), pp. 2954-2975. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2011.05.025; Zou, P.X.W., Wang, S., Fang, D., A life-cycle risk management framework for PPP infrastructure projects (2008) Journal of Financial Management of Property and Construction, 13 (2), pp. 123-142. , https://doi.org/10.1108/13664380810898131; Fontaine, M., (2015) Project Risk Management.

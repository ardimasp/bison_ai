It is used in database manipulation layer. This research develops a library to simplify hibernate criteria. The library that is called as Hibernate Criteria Extension (HCE) provides API functions to simplify code and easily to be used. Query associations can be defined by using dot. The library will automatically detect the join association(s) based on mapping in entity class. It can also be used in restriction and order. HCE is a hibernate wrapper library. The configuration is based on hibernate configuration. This library can be easily used by the developers whom familiar with hibernate usage. © 2016 IEEE.","database; hce; hibernate; java; query; simplify","Application programming interfaces (API); Database systems; Query processing; Software engineering; Critical issues; hibernate; java; query; Query association; S implications; simplify; Software development process; Software design",,,,,"Of, F., Edition, S., Database; Nacional, U.T., (2003) Development of A Relational Database Management System, 3 (2), pp. 33-37; Atzeni, P., Ceri, P.T., Database Systems; Lipitsäinen, A., ORM-Object Relational Mapping, pp. 1-30; Systems, D., Introduction to Database Concepts; Erhieyovwe, E., Oghenekaro, P., Oluwole, N., (2013) An Object Relational Mapping Technique for Java Framework, 2 (6), pp. 1-9; Barnes, J., (2007) Object-relational Mapping As A Persistence Mechanism for Object-oriented Applications, p. 113; Ireland, C., Bowers, D., (2015) Exposing the Myth: Object-Relational Impedance Mismatch Is A Wicked Problem, (C), pp. 21-26; Ireland, C., Bowers, D., Newton, M., Waugh, K., (2009) Understanding Object-relational Mapping: A Framework Based Approach, 2 (2), pp. 202-216; Lokhande, S., Patil, R., Kadam, A., Use of Hibernate in modern technology (2010) Project Management, 2, pp. 222-227; (2009) JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, , JBoss 12/2009",,"Hung N.L.Boo V.N.Q.Duy T.T.","IEEE Vietnam Section;Keysight Technologies;National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED)","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd National Foundation for Science and Technology Development Conference on Information and Computer Science, NICS 2016","14 September 2016 through 16 September 2016",,124536,,9781509020980,,,"English","NICS - Proc.

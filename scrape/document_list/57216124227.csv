People with obesity has higher risk for several serious health complications and on a larger scale, this could bring negative implications for economic growth and human wellbeing of a nation. Many studies have been conducted to overcome this issue and some suggested that regular self weighing could promote weight loss and weight maintenance. Based on those findings, a body weight tracking system is made as an approach from technological side. The purpose of this system is to raise health awareness by using easy-to-use technology to monitor user weight from time to time. The system consists of a realtime database, a smartphone application, and a modified digital weight scale. The weight scale is tested to have more than 99% accuracy and can active for estimated 40 hours of usage, while the realtime database storage for this implementation is adequate for more than half a million users. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","IoT; obesity; realtime database; weight tracking","Anthropometry; Database systems; Economics; Health risks; Internet of things; Nutrition; Tracking (position); Economic growths; Health awareness; Health complications; Human wellbeing; obesity; Real-time database; Smart-phone applications; Weight maintenance; Scales (weighing instruments)",,,,"Binus University","This project is financially supported by Binus University.","(2018) Potret Sehat Indonesia Dari Riskesdas 2018, , http://www.depkes.go.id/article/view/18110200003/potret-sehat-indonesia-dari-riskesdas-2018.html, Biro Komunikasi dan Pelayanan Masyarakat Kementrian Kesehatan RI Kementerian Kesehatan Republik Indonesia, 2 November [Online] [Accessed 1 1 2019]; Ng, M., Fleming, T., Robinson, M., Global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980-2013: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (2014) Lancet, 384 (9945), pp. 766-781; Litbangkes, B., Depkes, R.I., (2018) Riset Kesehatan Dasar (Riskesdas); Rachmi, C.N., Li, M., Baur, L.A., Overweight and obesity in Indonesia: Prevalence and risk factors - A literature review (2017) Elsevier, 147, pp. 20-29; Rizkiriani, A., Khomsan, A., Riyadi, H., Obesity and Hypertension among Adolescents in Jakarta, Indonesia (2014) Pakistan Journal of Nutrition, 13 (1), pp. 17-21; Mihardja, L., Soetrisno, U., Prevalence and Determinant Factors for Overweight and Obesity and Degenerative Diseases among Young Adults in Indonesia (2012) Journal of the ASEAN Federation of Endocrine Societies, 27 (1), pp. 77-81; Weisell, R.C., Body mass index as an indicator of obesity (2002) Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 11 (S8), pp. S681-684; (2011) Pedoman Praktis Memantau Status Gizi Orang Dewasa, , http://gizi.depkes.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ped-praktis-stat-gizi-dewasa.doc, Kemenkes RI Kementerian Kesehatan Republik Indonesia, 10 [Online] [Accessed 1 1 2019]; Vanwormer, J.J., French, S.A., Pereira, M.A., Welsh, E.M., The Impact of Regular Self-weighing on Weight Management: A Systematic Literature Review (2008) International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, 5; Chin, S.O., Keum, C., Woo, J., Park, J., Choi, H.J., Woo, J.-T., Rhee, S.Y., Successful weight reduction and maintenance by using a smartphone application in those with overweight and obesity (2016) Scientific Reports, pp. 1-8; Remax Smart Digital Bluetooth BMI Body Scale RT-S1, , https://remaxsa.co.za/product/remax-smart-digital-bluetooth-bmi-body-scale-rt-s1/, Remax Remax, [Online] [Accessed 30 September 2019]; Mi Smart Scale, , https://www.mi.com/global/scale/specs, Xiaomi Xiaomi, [Online] [Accessed 30 September 2019]; (2019) Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, , https://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/childhood_what/en/, World Health Organization World Health Organization [Online] [Accessed 30 August 2019]; Mass and Hanger Set, , https://www.pasco.com/file_downloads/Downloads_Manuals/Mass-and-Hanger-Set-Manual-ME-8979.pdf, PASCO [Online] [Accessed 28 09 2019]","Mae, J.; Computer Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: johannes@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

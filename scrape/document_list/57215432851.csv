The purpose of this research is to build a theoretical model to examine the relationship between latent variables using a questionnaire to collect research data. In a conceptual framework, Information Technology Capability is a second-order latent variable and consists of three first-order latent variables, Supply Chain Management is a second-order latent variable and consists of five first-order latent variables and Business Agility is a second-order latent variable and consists of four First-order latent variables and competitive advantage second-order latent variables and consist of three first-order latent variables. To explain the relationship between these latent variables, structural equation modeling (SEM) is used to test the goodness of fit of theoretical models and research hypotheses. This study uses 229 Electronic Stores home appliances in JABODETABEK (Greater Jakarta) as research subjects. It is the first empirical study that contributes empirical analysis in the electronic home appliances retail industry to illustrate the role of Information Technology, Inertia Culture and Business Agility capabilities in excellence in the context of the electronic home appliances retail industry in Indonesia. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

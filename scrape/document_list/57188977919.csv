Today there are a variety of tools used to communicate with stakeholder (supplier, customer, distributor, etc) in boundless place, so organizations' data will be kept in the various devices. The changing of this era drives the current trend of employees using their own laptop computers, cellular phones, smart phones, tablet, etc; both for personal and for work. However to successfully implement BYOD, the problems associated with privacy and security in BYOD environment should be identified. According to this circumstance, this study aims to identify some of the legal issues related to security and privacy challenge in BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) era, which can be a suggestion for institution to aware with these issues because security and privacy is the most important to any size of organization to run their business process. © 2016 IEEE.","BYOD; privacy challenge; security","Digital storage; Information management; Laptop computers; Personal computers; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Bring your own devices; Business Process; BYOD; Cellular Phone; Privacy and security; security; Security and privacy; Systematic literature review; Computer privacy",,,,,"Eslahi, M., Naseri, M.V., Hashim, H., Tahir, N.M., Saad, E.H.M., BYOD: Current state and security challenges (2015) ISCAIE 2014-2014 IEEE Symp.

The purpose of research is determine the coefficient of static wind load using computational calculations with FLUENT. The objects were modeled into a square 1x1 m, rectangle 2x1 m and circle diameter of 1 m with velocity of wind 10 m/s, 20 m/s and 30 m/s. The results described the value of the coefficient of drag force (CD) for square shape larger than rectangle. The coefficient of drag force (CD) for rectangular shape larger than circle. The value of coefficient of static wind do not depend on dimensional and wind speed. The coefficient value of wind static for Suramadu bridge which calculated by FLUENT Program and wind tunnel test have a similar chart patterns. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press.

Most organizations still face problems in EA implementation, EA Development is not an easy task. Since risk of failed EA implementation might occur, organization needs to know the Critical Success Factors (CSF) to implementation EA in organization especially in public sectors agency. This study provided a review of the extent literature (2007-2017) on framework that used to EA implementation and identify the CSF that affect to implement EA in public sectors agency. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) establish a synthesis analysis based on the research model using PRISMA checklist. The final list of selected primary studies for the first stage had 16 primary studies. Then, the full texts of 16 primary studies were analyzed. Then from that, performed the synthesis to produce Enterprise Architecture framework and factors that affect enterprise architecture implementation. Base on summarize, can be conclude that the most commonly used framework in this literature study is TOGAF and The US Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF), about 32% the public sectors using TOGAF framework to implementation EA, and about 25% public sectors using FEAF framework to implementation EA. According to the results of this study as many as 68% of papers say that the technical development is a CSF in the implementation of EA in public sector and about 50% of papers say that the framework and methodology is a CSF of implementation of EA in public sector. © 2018 The Authors.

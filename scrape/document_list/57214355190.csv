In order to obtain an optimal result, the classification process is performed using a decision tree with treeval and treefit function, where the value used is the result of the image feature extraction. For this image extraction, the values that originate from the approximation coefficient that uses the wavelet transform method deubecheuss level 2 and invariant movement. The research is performed on 7 types of pattern and 225 images. The result using 5 types of batik patterns namely lereng, parang, kawung, nitik and truntum using 20 test data on each pattern, has a similarity percentage above 80 - 85 percent. For 2 other patterns which is mega mendung and ceplok using 10 data on each pattern, has a similarity percentage above 30 - 40 percent only. Based on the result, further research is required to using other methods and functions. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","approximation coefficient; Batik; Invariant moment; treefit; treeval; Wavelet Transform","Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image processing; Image retrieval; Wavelet transforms; Approximation coefficients; Batik; Invariant moment; treefit; treeval; Image classification",,,,,"Ajay, K.S., Tiwari, S., Shukla, V.P., Wavelet Base Multi Kelas Image Classification using Neural Network (2012) International Journal of Computer Application, 37 (4); Balamurugan, Anandhakumar, P., Neuro-Fuzzy Based Clustering Approch for Content Based Image Retrieval Using 2D-Wavelet Transforn (2009) International Journal of Recent Trend in Engineering, 1 (1); Breiman, L., Friedman, J., Olshen, R., Stone, C., (1984) Classification and Regression Trees.

This research is a using new approach which is based on similarity of 3 characteristic namely shape characteristic texture characteristic and color characteristic. The results of these two characteristics similarities will be sorted by the aggregation value of every characteristic in textures/shapes and color. The sorting process based on the characteristic similarities of the image is the process of the Best Position Algorithm. This sorting feature is derived from the extraction shape or texture and color characteristics using the wavelet transform method and adaptive histogram function that focuses on the HSI color. In order to obtain the characteristic texture/shape optimally, the type of wavelet used is biorthogonal. The purpose is to get the Approximation coefficient from the optimal decomposition subsequent processing. The resulting coefficient will be recalculated with 5texture characteristic parameters which is the mean, standard deviation, energy, correlation and entropy. Therefore the texture/shape characteristic of every research object becomes more specific and detailed. Based on the testing and utilization of Best Position Algorithm and the above mentioned methods/functions, the precision percentage will be increased up to 90 percent and more relevant, in which the research object is fruit images, flower images and batik images. © Research India Publications.","Adaptive histogram; Approximation coefficient; Best position algorithm; Rbiorthogonal wevelet",,,,,,"Aji, S., Marimin, A., Herdiyeni, Y., (2007) Retrieval of Flower Image using Fuzzy rule-based system, , Master, Computer Science, Bogor Agricultural University; Banerjee, A., Kundu, M.K., ""Content based image retrieval with fuzzy geometrical features (2003) Fuzzy Systems, 2003.

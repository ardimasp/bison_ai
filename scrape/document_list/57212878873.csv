However, commonly this extraction task is still done by human experts manually, so the process is very expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, semantic segmentation is the process of classifying each pixel of an image as a class label to understand the image at a pixel level. This paper proposed an algorithm of semantic segmentation based on deep learning, namely Segmentation Networks (SatNet), for automatically segmenting buildings and roads. Our SatNet model is based on Residual Networks (ResNet) for image feature extraction. Finally, we compared the proposed algorithm to the state-of-the-art and our segmentation results have improved significantly.

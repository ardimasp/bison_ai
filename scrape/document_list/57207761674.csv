The performance concrete will decrease in that concrete such as less compressive strength and permeability. It is needed additive material has a water resistance in concrete mixture. In this research, it proposed crystalline as an additive material. The composition crystalline in concrete mixture is 0.8% from the weight of cement. The concrete mix design as follow SNI 03-2834-2000 standard. The method of concrete mixing used manual tool and concrete mixer. The mixer speed is set in this research are 25, 35, and 50 rotation perminutes (rpm). The delayed of addition crystalline in concrete mixture also done to know the effect of compressive strength concrete. The compressive strength is attained by using manual method and concrete mixer for 25 rpm, it is increased about 5.8% from the control concrete. However, the compressive strength is decreased for the speed of concrete mixer in 35 rpm and 50 rpm. The other additional material such as fly ash poured in concrete with crystalline 0.8%, but it doesn't improve the compressive strength of concrete. The delayed crystalline poured in fresh concrete doesn't affect the compressive strength of concrete. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

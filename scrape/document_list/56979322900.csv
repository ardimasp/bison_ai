If the location is static the needs can be addressed easily. There are high-speed transmission or broadband services offered by a large number of operators through both conventional and fiber optic cables. If the users are moving nomadically or are mobile, then obtaining large-capacity transmission systems is not simple. For some purposes, especially for small and medium-sized companies, they need to have alternative solutions that are economic and technically feasible. Cellular service providers offer 3G Internet services with wide coverage. This study develops an application using 3G services to provide broadband access that is economic and relatively simple. This solution uses multiple 3G connection to transmit information at high speed as if there is broadband channel capacity. Information on a Web Server can be downloaded by the parties concerned. The information retrieval can obtain the necessary capacity using multiple 3G connections. The technique of bundling multiple lower speed channels to obtain high-speed channel is called inverse multiplexing. In this research, the technique is simplified by using a router that has the ability to provide load balancing. This research was carried out by conducting laboratory experiments and field measurements. The experimental results show that the concept of inverse multiplexing through a number of channels with 3G services can run well for downloading files. © 2015 The Authors.

Therefore we need such a application for distribution of power outage information based on Android that capable of facilitating power outage service system in receiving problem report and deliver process of power outage evaluation which is ongoing or is done. Google Map Usage provides lots of assistance in mapping the nearest repair team location to where area of the power outage happened. The application is designed preceded by conducting analysis method of user requirement including analysis of the ongoing system, analysis of the findings of interview result as well as indentification of information necessity and system requirements. Designing focused on the Interface User Screen Design of mobile device and Web Admin Design. The research has resulted in a system modelling that capable of supporting the smooth running of distribution process of information on power outage in National Electricity Company. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT & LLS.

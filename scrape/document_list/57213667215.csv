There are two software used in designing a data warehouse system: IBM Informix Warehouse Feature Design Studio which is used for Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process and IBM Cognos Report Studio which is used for dashboard report sales area. The research methodology of this research is as follows: analysis through literature review, interviews, and observations. The data warehouse was designed using Ralph Kimball’s 9 stage of designing the data warehouse. The output of this research is a product of cloud-based data warehouse system that can be used by the finance industry on the sales subject area. © 2016 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Cloud computing; Data warehouse; IBM cognos; IBM informix; Multi-finance",,,,,,"Goswami, V., Patra, S.S., Mund, G.B., Optimal Management of Cloud Centers with Different Arrival Modes for Cloud Computing Environment (2012) International Journal of Cloud Applications and Computing, 2 (3), pp. 86-97; Gandhi, V.C., Prajapati, J.A., Darji, P.A., Cloud Computing with Data Warehousing (2012) International Journal of Emerging Trends & Technology in Computer Science, 1 (3), pp. 72-73; Aljabre, A., Cloud Computing for Increased Business Value (2012) International Journal of Business and Social Science, 3 (1), pp. 234-239; Inmon, W.H., Hackathorn, R.D., (1994) Using the data warehouse, , Somerset: Wiley-QED Publishing; Jindal, R., Taneja, S., Comparative Study Of Data Warehouse Design Approaches: A Survey (2012) International Journal of Database Management Systems (IJDMS), 4 (1), pp. 33-45; Inmon, W.H., (2005) Building the Data Warehouse, , (New York: John Wiley Sons Inc; Ouf, S., Nasr, M., The Cloud Computing: The Future of BI in the Cloud (2011) International Journal of Computer Theory and Engineering, 3 (6), pp. 750-754; Williams, B.K., Sawyer, S.C., (2011) Using Information Technology, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Connolly, T.M., Begg, C.E., (2005) Database Systems A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation, and Management, , Harlow: Pearson Education Limited; O’Brien, J.A., Marakas, G.M., (2010) Introduction to Information Systems, , New York: McGraw-Hill/Irwin; Kimball, R., Ross, M., Thornthwaite, W., Mundy, J., Becker, B., (2008) The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit, , Indianapolis: Wiley; Gour, V., Sarangdevot, S.S., Tanwar, G.S., Sharma, A., Improve Performance of Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) in Data Warehouse (2010) International Journal on Computer Science and Engineering, 2 (3), pp. 786-789; Reddy, G., Srinivasu, R., Rikkula, S.R., Data Warehousing, Data Mining, OLAP, and OLTP Technologies are Essential Elements to Support Decision-Making Process in Industries (2010) International Journal of Computer Science and Engineering, 2 (9), pp. 2865-2873; Barathi, K.K., Sree, K.S., Recent Developments on Data Warehouse and Data Mining In Cloud Computing (2015) International Journal of Computer Science Engineering and Technology (IJCSET), 5 (2), pp. 31-34; Gandhi, V.C., Prajapati, J.A., Darji, P.A., Cloud Computing with data warehousing and Analysis Market June 2009 (2012) International Journal of Emerging Trends & Technology in Computer Science (IJETTCS), 1 (3); Reynaud, C., Pernelle, N., Rousset, M., Data Extraction, Transformation and Integration Guided by an Ontology (2012) International Journal of Data Warehousing Design and Advanced Engineering Applications: Methods for Complex Construction, 1 (6), pp. 17-37; Verma, H., Data-warehousing on Cloud Computing (2013) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Engineering & Technology (IJARCET), 2 (2); Wilder, B., (2012) Cloud Architecture Patterns, , (Sebastopol: O’Reilly Media; (2016), http://www.cognos-bi.info/, Cognos Business Intelligence and Enterprise Performance Management, Retrieved September 13, from; Kirankumar, G., Sunil, K.J., Avinash, R.K., Analysis of Using a Business Intelligence Tool (COGNOS) in a Company to Result in More Efficient and Intuitive Company in the Current Era (2012) Business Intelligence Journal, 5 (2); Nabri, H., Ouazar, D., Hasnaoui, M., Spatial Data Warehouse Modeling at the Watershed Scale.

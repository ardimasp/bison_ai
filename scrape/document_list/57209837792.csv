The smart bed is able to identify the user and adjust its comfort settings according to the user's needs by using a fingerprint sensor and Arduino as the input-output controller. Raspberry Pi was used to control the whole system that comes in the form of smart module that can be assembled and customized in any type of bed, old or new. The smart bed was tested by 10 users and gained an 83% satisfaction rate. As an addition to the smart bed, a battery driven auto warm bolster was assembled as part of bed accessories that can maintain its temperature at 32°C to provide a comfortable level of warmth for the user. © 2019 Internetworking Indonesia.","Arduino; Finger print sensor; Smart bed; Smart bolster; Smart home",,,,,,"Buysse, D.J., Reynolds, C.F., III, Monk, T.H., Hoch, C.C., Yeager, A.L., Kupfer, D.J., Quantification of Subjective Sleep Quality in Healthy Elderly Men and Women Using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Sleep, 14 (4), pp. 331-338. , 1 July 1991; Pilcher, J.J., Ginter, D.R., Sadowsky, B., Sleep quality versus sleep quantity: Relationships between sleep and measures of health, wellbeing and sleepiness in college students Journal of Psychosomatic Research, 42 (6), pp. 583-596. , June 1997; Brown, F.C., Buboltz, W.C., Jr., Soper, B., Relationship of Sleep Hygiene Awareness, Sleep Hygiene Practices, and Sleep Quality in University Students (2002) Behavioral Medicine, 28 (1), pp. 33-38; Kirmil-Gray, K., Eagleston, J.R., Gibson, E., Thoresen, C.E., Sleep disturbance in adolescents: Sleep quality, sleep habits, beliefs about sleep, and daytime functioning Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 13 (5), pp. 375-384. , October 1984; Åkerstedt, T., Hume, K., Minors, D., Waterhouse, J., Good sleep-its timing and physiological sleep characteristics Journal of Sleep Research, 6 (4), pp. 221-229. , December 1997; Dogan, O., Ertekin, S., Dogan, S., Sleep quality in hospitalized patients Journal of Clinical Nursing, 14 (1), pp. 107-113. , January 2005; Chen, M.-Y., Wang, E.K., Jeng, Y.-J., Adequate sleep among adolescents is positively associated with health status and health-related behaviors BMC Public Health, 6 (1), p. 59. , 8 March 2006; Norlander, T., Johansson, A., Bood, S.A., The Affective Personality: Its Relation to Quality of Sleep, Well-Being and Stress (2005) Social Behavior and Personality: an international journal, 33 (7), pp. 709-722; Patel, N.P., Grandner, M.A., Xie, D., Branas, C.C., Gooneratne, N., ""Sleep disparity (2010) in the population: poor sleep quality is strongly associated with poverty and ethnicity, "" BMC Public Health, 10 (1), p. 475; Zhang, L., Yuan, Q., Wu, Q., Kwauk, S., Liao, X., Wang, C., Sleep quality and sleep disturbing factors of inpatients in a Chinese general hospital Journal of Clinical Nursing, 18 (17), pp. 2521-2529. , September 2009; Chan, M., Factors associated with perceived sleep quality of nurses working on rotating shifts Journal of Clinical Nursing, 18 (2), pp. 285-293. , January 2009; Suen, L.K.P., Hon, K.L.E., Tam, W.W.S., Association between Sleep Behavior and Sleep-Related Factors among University Students in Hong Kong The Journal of Biological and Medical Rhythm Research, 25 (5), pp. 760-775. , 18 April 2008; Afandi, O., Hawi, H., Mohammed, L., Salim, F., Hameed, A.K., Shaikh, R.B., Al Sharbatti, S., Khan, F.A., Sleep Quality Among University Students: Evaluating the Impact of Smoking, Social Media Use, and Energy Drink Consumption on Sleep Quality and Anxiety (2013) Inquiries Journal, 5 (6), pp. 1-3; External Factors that Influence Sleep (2008) WGBH Educational Foundation and the Harvard Medical School Division of Sleep Medicine, , http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/science/how/externalfactors, [Online].

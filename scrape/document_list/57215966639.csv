The method used is by questionnaires, interviews, observation, and literature study. This application also implements the A∗ algorithm to solve the pathfinding problems. The result of this research is ""The Adventure of BipBop"" app that can make the user can feel the experience of playing that is not only entertaining but also as a medium to convey about the culture of Indonesia and help preserve the traditional house of Indonesia. Most of the respondents find out that the application can provide Indonesian culture well (91.7%). Furthermore, this application can realize about 84.5% of players to help preserve the traditional culture in Indonesia. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

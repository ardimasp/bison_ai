The collaboration with customers is also known as co-creation strategy and predominantly drives transformational performance. Transformational performance is based on performance management theory and transformation paradigms. However, its development to ensure the works of co-creation strategy, based on customer experience, remains unclear. To address this gap the digital transformational model based on co-creation strategy, with a focus on customer experience, was investigated to accelerate transformational performance. This study uses quantitative research, with a sample of 35 representatives from telecommunication firms. The findings demonstrate that co-creation strategy significantly supports customer experience, in driving transformational performance. Customer experience also appears to significantly impact co-creation strategy indirectly. The findings have theoretical implications for the emergence of collaboration strategy in the disruptive era. They show practitioners how co-creation strategy is becoming key in sustaining the business, as it shifts the focus onto the development of customer experience to drive transformational performance. Suggestions for future research are also included in the study. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Co-creation strategy; Customer experience; Transformational performance",,,,,,"Bolton, R.N., Gustafsson, A., McColl-Kennedy, J., Sirianni, N.J., Tse, D.K., Small details that make big differences: A radical approach to consumption experience as a firm's differentiating strategy (2014) Journal of Service Management, 25 (2), pp. 253-274; Brochado, A., Troilo, M., Shah, A., Airbnb customer experience: Evidence of convergence across three countries (2017) Annals of Tourism Research, 63, pp. 210-212; Cave, D., Digital Islands: How the Pacific's ICT Revolution is Transforming the Region (2012) Lowy Institute Analyses, pp. 1-24. , https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/155343/cave_digital_islands_web.pdf; D'Aveni, R.A., Gunther, R., (1994) Hypercompetition: Managing the Dynamics of Strategic Maneuvering, , (1st ed.).

The aimed of this study was to improve the ability to calculate the addition and subtraction of numbers in mixed count material in mathematics using the Abacus learning model in second grade students of Elementary School Kebraon II Surabaya, Indonesia. This study was an action research employing the Abacus learning model with the Kurt Lewin model approach with two cycles and consists of four main steps for each cycle: planning, action, observation, and reflection. The data were gathered through documentation, interview, observation, and tests. The data analysis was done by using the individual and classical learning mastery. The results of this research indicated that the implementation of the Abacus learning model can improve the second grade students score of Elementary School Kebraon II Surabaya, Indonesia up to 86.66% and can raise the learning achievement process as ""Good""criteria between teachers and students. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Abacus Learning Model; Numeracy Mathematics","Engineering research; Mathematical instruments; Students; Action research; Elementary schools; Indonesia; Learning achievement; Learning models; Model approach; Learning systems",,,,,,,"Frengky, Model Pembelajaran Matematika Siswa Kelas Satu Sekolah Dasar (2008) J Pisikologi [Internet], 35 (2), pp. 151-163. , https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jpsi/article/view/7949/6147; Riyanti, Sutama, Maryadi, Manajemen Pembelajaran Matematika di SD Negeri Mangkubumen 83 Surakarta (2017) Varia Pendidik [Internet], 29 (1), pp. 65-74. , http://journals.ums.ac.id/index.php/varidika/article/view/5150; Suci, S.H.A., Rosyidah, E., Asitah, N., Aini, N., Murni, A.W., Anam, F., Learning from picture and picture action research: Enhancement of counting ability on division of numbers for primary school students (2018) J Phys Conf ser [Internet]., 1114 (1), p. 012044. , http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1114/1/012044; Setiabudi, W., Peningkatan Hasil Belajar Berhitung Penjumlahan melalui Media Pembelajaran Dekak-Dekak bagi Siswa Tunagrahita Ringan Kelas VI SDLBC di SLB Yapenas (2017) J Widia Ortodidaktika [Internet], 6 (5), pp. 527-537. , http://journal.student.uny.ac.id/ojs/index.php/plb/article/view/7782; Gunawan, A., Analisis Kesalahan dalam Menyelesaikan Soal Cerita pada Mata Pelajaran Matematika Siswa Kelas V SDN 59 Kota Bengkulu (2016) J Pgsd J Ilm Pendidik Guru Sekol Dasar [Internet]., 9 (2), pp. 216-225. , https://ejournal.unib.ac.id/index.php/pgsd/article/viewFile/4618/2511; Yulastri, Peningkatan Hasil Belajar Operasi Pengurangan Bilangan Cacah melalui Blok Dienes pada Siswa Kelas I SDN 21 Batang Anai Kabupaten Padang Pariaman (2017) J Penelit Pendidik Indones [Internet], 3 (2), pp. 57-66. , http://jurnal.iicet.org/index.php/jppi/article/view/117; Widodo Widayanti, L., Peningkatan Aktivitas Belajar dan Hasil Belajar Siswa dengan Metode Problem Based Learning pada Siswa Kelas VIIA MTs Negeri Donomulyo Kulon Progo Tahun Pelajaran 2012/2013 (2013) J Fis Indones [Internet]., 17 (49), pp. 32-35. , https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jfi/article/view/24410; Saja'ah, U.F., Analisis Kesulitan Siswa Kelas IV Sekolah Dasar dalam Menyelesaikan Soal Pemecahan Masalah (2018) Anal Kesulitan Siswa Dalam Menyelesaikan Soal Pemecahan Masal [Internet]., 10 (2), pp. 98-104. , http://ejournal.upi.edu/index.php/eduhumaniora/article/view/10866; Widayati, A., Penelitian tindakan kelas (2008) J Penelit Tindakan Kelas [Internet]., 6 (1), pp. 87-93. , https://journal.uny.ac.id/index.php/jpakun/article/view/1793; Gillies, R.M., Cooperative Learning: Review of Research and Practice (2016) Aust J Teach Educ [Internet]., 41 (3), pp. 39-54. , https://ro.ecu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2902&context=ajte; Tambak, S., Metode Ceramah: Konsep dan Aplikasi dalam Pembelajaran Pendidikan Agama Islam (2014) J Tarb [Internet]., 21 (2), pp. 375-401. , http://jurnaltarbiyah.uinsu.ac.id/index.php/tarbiyah/article/view/16; Sari, N.A., Studi Komparasi Penerapan Media Abacus dan Media Blokjes terhadap Prestasi Belajar Matematika Anak Tunanetra Kelas V SLB-A (2014) Model J Progr Stud Pgmi [Internet]., 1 (2), pp. 140-114. , http://jurnal.stitnualhikmah.ac.id/index.php/modeling/article/view/39; Rosita, A., Kresnadi, H., Yusmin, E., Peningkatan Aktivitas Pembelajaran Matematika dengan Menggunakan Media Abacus pada Siswa Kelas IV Sekolah Dasar Negeri No 52 Tokang Sekayam (2013) J Pendidik Dan Pembelajaran Khatulistiwa [Internet], 2 (3), pp. 1-5. , http://jurnal.untan.ac.id/index.php/jpdpb/article/view/1391; Hikmah, N., Peningkatan Hasil Belajar Matematika tentang Penjumlahan dan Pengurangan Bilangan Bulat melalui Alat Peraga Mistar Bilangan pada Siswa Kelas IV Elementary School 005 Samarinda Ulu (2016) J Pendas Mahakam [Internet]., 1 (1), pp. 80-85. , https://jurnal.fkip-uwgm.ac.id/index.php/pendasmahakam/article/viewFile/46/16; Iskandar, A., Rizal, M., Kurniasih, N., Sutiksno, D.U., Purnomo, A., The Effects of Multimedia Learning on Students Achievement in Terms of Cognitive Test Results (2018) J Phys Conf ser [Internet]., 1114 (1), p. 012019. , https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1114/1/012019; Fauziyah Ratna, P., Yuliati, N., Nuriman.

Apart from being a medium for learning and conveying various information about Indonesia, BIPA teaching can also introduce Indonesian culture to foreign speakers. From year to year, international speakers who learn Indonesian continue to grow. This was accompanied by an increase in the number of BIPA providers in Indonesia. To support the acceleration of this growth, digital service is needed to make it easier to find native speaker tutors and adjust material according to the needs of foreign speakers. This digital service is a website that can bring international speakers and Indonesian language tutors wherever they are.

Informal leadership refers to someone lacking a formal position, but who becomes an informal group leader, i.e. clerics or 'kiai'. The research questionnaire was put to the entire teacher population at LP Ma'arif NU. Proportional random sampling was used to question the three education levels in 18 districts. The study concluded that the role of informal leadership and principal performance together significantly influences the quality of culture in the Institution. The increased role of informal leadership, and the increased performance of principals will improve the quality of its culture. This research is important because it will benefit religious education institutions like LP Ma'arif NU throughout Indonesia, as well as units of Madrasah education or self-help schools. It will also help the self-cultivation of the Nahdliyin people, and for central and local government policies. © Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Informal leadership; Quality culture; School head performance",,,,,,,,"Bacal, R., (2010) Leadership Development for Informal Leaders, , Leadership Development Resource Center; Eshun, E.F., Touphic, M.A., Edward, A., Exploring the impact of pedagogical strategies in drawing instruction on drawing skills satisfaction: A case study on Ghanaian communication design students (2018) International Journal of Innovation, Creativity and Change, 4 (2), pp. 104-122; Harvey, L., (2017) Analytic Quality Glossary, , Quality Research International; (2014) Peraturan dan Pedoman Kerja Lembaga Pendidikan Ma'arif Nahdlatul Ulama, , LP Ma'arif NU Pusat.

The children assumed that mathematics is a disliked subject, while most of the aspects in the daily life require the ability to count. The primary education about the numbers is still lacking. In early childhood, a math learning activity should be in a fun atmosphere in learning. To know numbers need to be presented creatively by using media such as multimedia-based computers so as not to get bored for the students. The application of number recognition for early childhood is equipped with sound to assist the students in pronouncing the numbers. By using the computer, the students can recognize the number 1 to 10 increased by about 37%, 39% of the students can write the numbers, and 15% of them can say the numbers. © 2018 Authors.","Early chilhood; Image object; Multimedia; Number recognition",,,,,,,,"Simarmata, J., ""Learning Application of Multimedia-Based-Computer Network Using Computer Assisted Instruction Method,"" (2018) Int.

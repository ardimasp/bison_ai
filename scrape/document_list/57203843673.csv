The method used is by questionnaires, interviews, observation, and literature study. The result of this research is NYAM app that can search for food based on GPS, categories, and types and this app can facilitate the search for suitable eating place where user can see restaurant profiles, comments, like, and amenities rating, hygiene, and service, as well as restaurant owners, can promote a place to eat in this application. Most of the respondents find out that the application was easy to use (94.10%), and features were easy to understand (89.1%). The majority of the respondents (84.10%) will continue to use the NYAM system because they find the NYAM system was helping them to find the best restaurant to have their meals with a decent price and have good tastes (88.40%). © 2018 The Authors.

The modification of FPPD and LSB Substitution is located at the pixel block that is going to be used to insert the secret message. The pixel block being used is 2x2. The LSB Substitution method is a method to insert the data by changing the last bit of the pixel into the byte of the hidden message. FPPD uses data blocks and calculates the capacity of each blocks, then inserts the hidden message in accordance to the capacity of each blocks. The development of this method is expected to increase the capacity of the plain text without reducing the quality of the data produced.

Parallel schedule generation scheme is used to generate feasible scheduling solutions, while firefly algorithm is used to find optimal solution by updating priority value of each activity. A web-based application is developed to run the scheduling simulation. Scheduling simulation is conducted to determine the optimal parameter values for firefly algorithm and minimum project makespan. The optimal firefly algorithm parameter values are 10 for light absorption coefficient value, 10 for firefly population, 100 for maximal iteration, and 0.8 for random parameter. With 6 structure resources and 12 finishing resources available for construction project, the minimum project makespan value is [110, 142, 167, 224] with fuzzy magnitude value of 213.583. © 2018 The Authors.

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is one of symmetric encryption that most used often and the most secure encryption today. However, AES encryption has slow computation. Our experiment show that both of algorithms combination needs 3.045 milliseconds for 1024 bytes of data and increase 3-4 milliseconds for 2048 bytes of data and so on. This paper proposes a novelty method to improve AES algorithm with Shift Row and S.Box modification for Mix Column transformation. The result show that our optimization has reduced 3 milliseconds and continue to increase as the number of bytes increases. Percentage average of the optimization is 86.143%. © 2017 The Authors.

The objective function of the model is to minimize total cost consisting of in process and completed part inventory costs, setup costs, preventive and corrective maintenance costs and rework cost on two machines. The Model was a mixed integer quadratic that contains some integer and binary variables, so that analytic search solution could not be used for the model. It was developed a stepwise optimization method to solve the model. This model describes the trade-off between production cost and maintenance cost as the increasing of production run length on two machines.

Combining is carried on by scheme of hierarchically segmentation (Quad-tree Segmentation) which able to hierarchically partition input of the main image into several size of block based on various pixel under value of maximal capacity criterion for every block that is partitioned. These blocks is organized to be a tree structure for every block that is represented.

Threrefore the method of steganography is made for hiding information in some medium in such a way that the medium seemingly is not contained a piece of information when it seen by human eyes. One of the steganography methods is Pixel Value Differencing (PVD). PVD is inserting message byte into the difference in bytes of the applied medium. This steganography use the modified PVD with some modification. The modification will be carried out on the pixel pick up pattern using spiral pattern to form pixel pair. It will make the message extraction become more difficult. Based on Peak Signal to Noise Ratio(PSNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE) calculation, The results of this study and survey show that using method of Spiral PVD, the quality of the produced image is relatively good.The image before and after message insertion process has relatively same quality.

By looking at these requirements, a safer way to communicate, such as Cryptography, has been developed. However, the result of this method is not sufficient, because it still risk from the interception of the sent data, caused by cryptography which only hides the data resulting the packaging to be suspicious and draw attention of the hijackers. Therefore, Steganography then developed in which not only hides the content, but also deceptive hijackers with packaging that is not suspicious. In this paper, we discuss the design of steganography which is applied in mobile devices (e.g. mobile phone) using the BPCS (Bit-Plane Complexity Segmentation) by hiding text message into the media reservoir of JPEG data types images. When using this method the message hiding capacity is larger than any other method, up to 40% of the image container.

Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper. Findings: This paper identifies two paths of digital transformation. The offensive path is aggressive and involves the rapid acquisition of digital resources through portfolio investment and merger and acquisition tactics. The defensive path is relatively slow and relies on the organic growth of the digital capabilities of the incumbent companies over time. Research limitations/implications: This paper identifies a number of potential factors affecting the choice of the transformation path taken by companies. Further studies can be conducted to investigate these contingent factors. Practical implications: This study describes the strategic paths available in a digital transformation and identifies the conditions that might justify a particular approach. Originality/value: This paper identifies two types of paths that are generally followed by companies aiming digital transformation – offensive and defensive. This aspect has not been studied in any other research work. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ambidexterity; Digital transformation; Innovation; M&A; Organic growth; Strategic paths",,,,,,,"Andersen, P., Ross, J.W., Transforming the LEGO group for the digital economy (2016) Thirty Seventh International Conference on Information Systems, , Dublin; (2018) How Goldman uses M&A to bring in talent for Marcus, , www.cbinsights.com/research/goldman-sachs-fintech-acquisitions/, (accessed: 29 December 2019; Endres, H., Stoiber, K., Wenzl, N.M., Managing digital transformation through hybrid business models (2019) Journal of Business Strategy; Friedman, W., (2019) Netflix posts $16B revenues for 2018, records subscriber growth, , www.mediapost.com/publications/article/330734/netflix-posts-16b-revenues-for-2018-records-subs.html, (accessed: 12 November 2019; (2018) Why Goldman Sachs’ marriage of Marcus and investment management makes sense, , www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2018/10/22/why-goldman-sachss-marriage-of-marcus-and-investment-management-make-sense/#41ece2504aaa, (accessed: 29 December 2019; Graebner, M.E., Heimeriks, K.H., Huy, Q.N., Vaara, E., The process of postmerger integration: a review and agenda for future research (2017) Academy of Management Annals, 11 (1), pp. 1-32; King, A.W., Disentangling interfirm and intrafirm causal ambiguity: a conceptual model of causal ambiguity and sustainable competitive advantage (2007) Academy of Management Review, 32 (1), pp. 156-178; Penrose, E.T., (1959) The Theory of Growth of Firm, , Blackwell, Oxford; (2018) Goldman Sachs makes $20 million investment in tech startup, , www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1c409440rg92f/Goldman-Sachs-Makes-20-Million-Investment-in-Tech-Startup, (accessed: 29 December 2019; Singh, A., Hess, T., How chief digital officers promote the digital transformation of their companies (2017) MIS Quarterly Executive, 16 (1), pp. 1-17; Turner, M., Hernandez, R., (2017) Goldman Sachs’ new online lending business has already hit a $1 billion milestones, , www.businessinsider.sg/goldman-sachs-new-online-lending-business-has-already-hit-a-1-billion-milestone-2017-6/?r=US&IR=T, (accessed: 29 December 2019; Vial, G., Understanding digital transformation: a review and a research agenda (2019) The Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 28 (2), pp. 118-144; Walsh, B., (2018) With shift of online bank Marcus, Goldman signal ambitions to come in wealth management, , www.barrons.com/articles/goldman-sachs-shifts-marcus-digital-bank-into-its-asset-management-unit-signaling-an-expansion-in-wealth-management-although-what-that-will-look-like-remains-uncertain-1540240063, (accessed: 29 December 2019; (2020), www.netflixinvestor.com/financials/annual-reports-and-proxies/default.aspx, (accessed: 29 December 2019; (2020), www.cbinsights.com/research/fintech-investments-top-us-banks/, (accessed: 29 December 2019","Margiono, A.; Binus Business School Master Program, Indonesia; email: mmargiono@binus.edu",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,02756668,,,,"English","J.

The research utilized the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model and relative importance analysis to achieve the objective. This research discovered that perceived trainer personality, perceived trainer knowledge, and perceived trainer participant engagement skills played important roles in design thinking training effectiveness - measured from trainees' perceptions of knowledge improvement, knowledge depth, and knowledge expectations. The relative importance analysis further showed that perceived trainer personality was ranked as the most important factor towards participants' perceptions of knowledge improvement; the research also found that perceived trainer engagement skills were seen as the most important factor in deep learning and satisfaction.

The purpose of this paper is to: re-conceptualize extant business model frameworks so that they can analyze social ventures; identify the key characteristics of social ventures; and identify the typology of effective social venture business model configurations. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses resource dependence theory to make sense of extant business models and borrows from public administration literature to identify key characteristics and different configurations of social venture business models. Findings: The paper re-conceptualizes business model frameworks as inter-organizational arrangements to cope with external resource dependence; this paper also identifies four key characteristics of social ventures, and develops a social venture business model typology based on these unique key characteristics and extant business model dimensions. Research limitations/implications: The typology may guide further social venture research, e.g. research on social venture business model creation, on social venture business model innovation, and on social change. Limitations and boundary conditions are discussed in the paper. Practical implications: The research may further help social entrepreneurs to develop effective business models that meet the social and financial objectives. Originality/value: The paper offers a novel reconceptualization of traditional business model frameworks, a unique set of key characteristics of social ventures, and a theoretical typology of effective social venture business model configurations. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business model; Characteristics; Resource dependence theory; Social enterprise; Social venture; Typology",,,,,,,"Afuah, A., Redefining firm boundaries in the face of the internet: are firms really shrinking?

Low Powered Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is used as a communication network. LoRa devices are configured with a frequency of 470 MHz, spread factor 9, bandwidth of 31.25 KHz, and code rate of 4/5. The study found that the UM402 LoRa module has the farthest network range, up to 1 Km. By focusing on a range of up to 250 m, the LoRa Dragino shield has the fastest data packet delivery time at 0.77 s. UM402 LoRa module has the largest Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) value at 50m, it is -34. All LoRa devices used in this research can operate well at the ideal distance of street lights (35 m). © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

IOT applications for Home Security and Smart Home applications are of interest. Both applications are sensor rich and those sensors face the problem of transmitting data related to their task. Hence, this research concern providing solution of data transmission infrastructure within the house and ultimately to a centralized control and monitoring site. Infrastructure is important as each sensor has its specific task and generally made by different vendors. The infrastructure selection methods is based on the logic that wireless infrastructure is preferred to avoid costly installation and aesthetics reasons. Energy consumption for green compliance is another consideration. Sensors that are IOT ready are low power for green compliance. IOT ready sensors have intelligence embedded to it and could receive and transmit data according to its needs. In this research Lorawan is selected as the solution of providing the wireless infrastructure within a house due to its readiness for IOT and fulfil other requirements as well. The behaviour of Lorawan in terms of data transmission reliability and coverage is measured. Experiments are conducted for determining transmission coverage. The result shows Lorawan is suitable for implementing in house wireless infrastructure. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

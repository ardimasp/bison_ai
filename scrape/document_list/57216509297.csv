The research on developing a Chinese grammar checking website is aimed at helping Mandarin learners in mastering Mandarin grammar. This website can be a ""learning companion"" of basic-level Mandarin learners outside the classroom. This technology is still very new, so this research should be carried out immediately by researchers in Indonesia to master this technology. The method used in this research is a quantitative approach. The collection of grammar patterns that will appear on the chineseteak.net will be selected from several Chinese textbooks. Then the pattern will become Mandarin grammar patterns and will be entered the website auto-correct grammar. This website is designed using PHP and MySQL as the database. From the results of the questionnaire, we can find out that there are 7 points of Mandarin grammar that are still difficult for early learners. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Natural language processing systems; Websites; Grammar checkers; Indonesia; Learning companions; NAtural language processing; Quantitative approach; Engineering education",,,,"Binus University: 033/VR, BNS2019-184, RTT/IV/2019","This research is a part of BINUS University research grant (Proposal Number: BNS2019-184; Contract Number: 033/VR.RTT/IV/2019), which got financial support from research transfer and technology office, Jakarta.

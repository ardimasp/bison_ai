It because the only product produced by Research Institute is knowledge. P2LD LIPI (Deep Sea Research Center - Indonesian Institute of Sciences) has faced problems; one of them is limited human resources, noticed from the number of available researchers who are mostly in their retirement period. It requires right solution to solve it, which is right KM implementation to give positive impact for organization advancement. That problem is noticed before the existence of knowledge sharing culture and lack of KM understanding, so knowledge is only owned by an individual. The current KM implementation do not give the expected result yet and need to be evaluated the reason and how to solve. Instrument that is used in research has been tested both validity and reliability. This study used OCAI as instrument that researched the effect of organization culture to KM process and questionnaires as instrument that researched the effect of organization structure to KM process in P2LD LIPI. Using simple regression analysis tests KM process and organization structure. From analysis, P2LD organization culture is expected to have clan and hierarchy cultures with requirements clan dominates and from organization structure and KM process are resulted an analysis that there is an influence between those 2 variables. From this research, it can be concluded that organization culture at P2LD is expected to be clan and hierarchy that are flexible, caring each other, stable and controllable. Besides that, there will be top-down information flow and working in team. © 2017 IEEE.","KM Process; Knowledge Management; OCAI; Organization Culture; Organization Structure","Regression analysis; Surveys; Deep sea research; Evaluation of knowledge; Knowledge sharing cultures; OCAI; Organization culture; Organization structures; Research institutes; Simple regression analysis; Knowledge management",,,,,"Alavi, M., Leidner, D.R., Review : Knowledge management and knowledge management systems : Conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Quarterly, pp. 107-136; Ambon, P.L., (2016) LKJ P2LD 2015.

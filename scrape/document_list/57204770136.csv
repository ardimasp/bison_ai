The primary objective of the study is to examine students’ intentions to become entrepreneurs as an impact of gamification model learning in Entrepreneurship or Business Plan courses in BINUS ONLINE Learning. Data collection was carried out for 400 students who took Entrepreneurship and Business Plan courses for 1 month using questionnaires. The data was then analyzed using multiple linear regression approach. The result shows that attitude towards behavior (ATB), perceived behavior control (PBS), and subjective norms partially give positive impacts and they are significant to entrepreneurial intentions. Perceived behavioral control (PBC) is the dominant factor in forming entrepreneurial intentions for students. © 2020 by the authors","Entrepreneurial Intentions; Long Distance Learning Program; Planned Behavior",,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; (2019) Pertumbuhan Ekonomi Indonesia Triwulan IV-2018.

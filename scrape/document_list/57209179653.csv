This emerging technology is extraordinary and has the potential to become a source of growth. The telecommunications industry 4.0 is undergoing transformational development to deal with disruptive technological challenges. Globally, quality has declined from the past few decades, a combination of a stagnant economy and an increase in the quality of income has caused dissatisfaction. Inertia services that are often suffered by large companies are often difficult to shake, customer expectations have also shifted in the market, placing the company in a difficult situation in achieving customer satisfaction, agile and innovative technological trends, cost competition, government policy, and this will increase the level of global competition. Exploration case studies and literature reviews are used to test the antecedents of Service Innovation. The study identifies that disruption of technology services offers opportunities for business development to encourage the use of Internet-based services, increasing demand for cheaper and faster internet for consumers. To facing a competitive advantage, organizations have influenced by Service Innovation with the ability to improve big data analytics and organize future knowledge management capabilities, which are agile and flexible in providing information and solutions. From the managerial perspective, this research provides a comprehensive view of what the impact of Service Innovation is on organizations, how to achieve, what variables contribute, and how to relate with performance. The authenticity of this research lies in the description of how management emerges with a practical oriented framework of how organizations must be formed to be innovative and competitive through the general arrangement of antecedents of service innovation. This study, however, has limitations because the qualitative nature and conceptual framework need to have further investigated through large-scale surveys by quantitative research. © BEIESP.","Big Data Analytics; Competitive Advantage; Disruption Technology; Knowledge Management; Service Innovation",,,,,,"Fagan, T., Understanding the Services revolution,” 2014.

Data Center department supports data storage, and providing the platform for the deployment of business applications. But some downtime issues still could emerge and require human resources to solve those issues. In this paper, we define some major issues those are connection down, server down, and broken data in UAT environment. Therefore, Bank XYZ’s data center needs an automation system for accurate and immediate solution. Automation system will need information from the log management application to do responses. Thus, this research’s objective is to have an automation design for operating automation in the Data Center department based on rules in log management. Research data are obtained from observation and interview methods. This research has discovered an automation design to help the Data Center department for helping them fixing their downtime issues. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

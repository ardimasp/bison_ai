The proposed recommendation system is discussing about Data finitihotel recommendations for a place across U.S. The selected process for the recommendation is calculating the rating of hotel categories on the city. By calculating hotel categories from several city by combining two features namely categories and taken from the city of the selected hotelcategory as well. The result of process will be recommended hotel with highest ratingto the user. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Hotels; Collaborative recommendation; Content-based recommendation; Recommender systems",,,,,"Madhushree, B., A Novel Research Paper Recommendation System (2016) International Journal of Advanced Research in Engineering and Technology, 7, pp. 7-16; Ricci, F., Rokach, L., Shapira, B., Kantor, P., (2011) Recommender Systems Handbook; Wang, D., Liang, Y., Xu, D., Feng, X., Guan, R., A Content-based Recommender System for Computer Science Publications (2018) Elsevier Knowledge Based System, 157, pp. 1-9; Joshi, T., Improved Product Ranking for Recommendation Systems (2016) IOSR Journal of Computer Engineering, 18, pp. 18-23; Wikipedia, 'Wikipedia Recommender System,' Wikipedia, 25 August 2019.

Jakarta Open Data shares employment data that is able to be starting point into analysis or recommendation by building data warehouse. OLTP data suggested for the data warehouse is the existing employment type based transactions, which will be used to analyze employment and unemployment rate in each region. The proposed method to design the data warehouse is using 9-steps from Kimball. The selected process for the data warehouse is calculating number of employment type, with dimensions of region, education type, sex and employment type. Region has 3 level area in sub-district and village. The result of process and analysis will be provided into certain reports and dashboard. Dashboard will be very helpful directly to provide high level data for all stakeholder or decision maker. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Data warehouses; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Employment; 3 levels; Decision makers; Employment data; Jakarta; Social problems; Unemployment rates; Open Data",,,,,"Setiawan, Y., Kemdikbud upayakan wajib belajar 12 tahun melalui pip (2019) Kemdikbud, , https://psmk.kemdikbud.go.id/konten/1906/kemdikbud-upayakan-wajib-belajar-12-tahun-melalui-pip, 16 September 2016.

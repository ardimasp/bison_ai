Fundamentally, R shows the last transaction, F is the number of transactions, and M represents a total amount of expenses. It has often been applied and provides an effective analysis for decision makers to promote their product strategies. However, this is considered not able to accommodate the segmentation needs of banking customers; thus customer balance should be involved in the analysis process theoretically. The customer balance (B) is potentially able to be functioned for the customer segmentation process and fruitful in marketing strategies. The developed model is called the recency-frequency-monetary-balance (RFM+B) model. It is a segmentation model of bank’s customer considering four aspects: recency, frequency, monetary, and balance, where it is developed by using main method K-Means. The constructed model is applied successfully in one bank’s 65 thousand customers coming from 147 thousand transaction data in period of the first half of 2017: cash payments, cash deposits, over-booking, and transactions through ATMs. The result shows that clusters 0 until 3 are dominantly filled by customers with high R (with average 113.17 times), high B (with average 3,487,790,000 Indonesian rupiah), high F (with 315.73 times), and high M (with average 5,000,000,000 Indonesian rupiah) respectively. © 2021 ICIC International.","Bank’s customers; Customer segmentation; K-Means; RFM+B model; Segmentation model",,,,,"Binus University","We would like to thank BINUS University who has supported our works, particularly BINUS Graduate Program, Master of Computer Science.","Kustina, K.

When the IT service management system (SMS) and an information security management system (ISMS) are implemented separately, it can lead to consuming high resources and costly. This paper is going to focus on the integration of ISO 20001 as SMS standard, ITIL v3 as the framework, and ISO 27001 as ISMS standard. We are going to discuss how the ITIL V3 can be combined with ISO 20001 and ISO 27001 by scientifically matching the similarities of process, procedure, and resources. This paper contributes to providing a guideline for an IT organization that is going to implement SMS and ISMS standard and framework. In the Appendix section 4, we also provide a table of process, procedures, and resources similarities. Therefore, the organization can use the combined processes in order to reduce the cost of implementing those standards. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

To be able to survive in the fierce global competition, companies, especially companies engaged in the production sector, need to do a strategic production planning (SPP). This study aims to achieve optimal decisions in strategic production planning based on the product life cycle (PLC) using the decision support model (DSM). The DSM for suggesting the optimal model for SPP based on PLC is a proposed contribution to knowledge. In this study, several methods operated which are divided into 2 stages. The first step was to construct a similarity model. Here, Euclidean distance and fuzzy logic methods operated technically to determine the existence stage of a product in PLC. In the second stage, an optimization model was developed, where deep analysis and mathematical methods used for the selection of the right strategy and the hybrid L2HC method functioned to optimize the strategies chosen previously to produce optimal decisions in strategic production planning. © ICIC International 2020.","Decision support model; Fuzzy logic; Latin-hyper-cube-hill-climbing; Optimization; Product life cycle; Strategic production planning",,,,,"Binus University","We would like to thank BINUS University who has supported our works, particularly BINUS graduate program, Master of Computer Science.","Gianesi, I.

The number of restaurants does not mean someone will visit each restaurant, so it is going to depend on various consideration. Here, an intelligent decision support model was developed to help people to get a restaurant suggestion that suitable for them. Seven parameters were adopted scientifically, i.e. customer interest, price/budget, distance between customer and restaurant, taste rating, cleanliness rating, facilities rating, and halal or nonhalal status. Through using the methods fuzzy logic, cosine similarity distance, selection, and optimization (i.e. hybrid Latin hyper-cube-hill-climbing), model is able to provide restaurant recommendation for individual user or group. In this study, the experiment involved 75 restaurants in Jakarta and eight customers. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

The model uses the fuzzy logic method as a basis for calculations in choosing the right plants to be planted in certain areas and can reduce the risk of loss due to incorrect selection of plants. DSM works by analyzing the ecological and economic values inherent in soil and plant variables. In the analysis of ecological values, starting with the use of the fuzzy logic method for parameterizing to get a crisp value, then proceed with calculating the Euclidean value to get the minimum distance between the parameters of the soil variable of an area with plant variables that can be planted. Continue to economic analysis by calculating the value of optimization. Fuzzy can be used to convey information from ambiguous data. Taking into account the parameters that can be produced suitable plants in terms of ecology; namely rainfall, humidity, temperature, altitude/height, and sunshine; and economic aspects, namely the consistency of market prices for areas Surabaya, Sulawesi South, Central Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, and Banten. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The agriculture area in Indonesia has specific characteristic for each area (e.g., water capacity, land porosity, land height, etc.,). Furthermore, food crop is the most plant planted in Indonesia; rice, corn, red bean, green bean are some important food crops. The study aims to create a Decision Support Model based on fuzzy logic (FDSM). The model is able to recommend the most suitable food crop to be rationally planted in a specified area. The recommendation is based on distance value between plant and area characteristic value. Two main methods are operated in this study, they are fuzzy logic and Euclidean distance measurement. The method fuzzy logic purposely avoids the ambiguity of parameter value and considers the human linguistic based parameter value. Afterward, the Euclidean distance adopted to calculate the fitness value as a fundamental value for decision recommendation. Here, seven geographic parameters (i.e., water availability, temperature, humidity, land height, land slope, rainfall and land porosity) matched to food crop's biotic parameters in finding the fittest value. Finally, the model shows a simulation of recommendation for 514 administrative areas of 34 provinces' district/municipality (in Indonesia) based on five types of food crops (i.e., rice, maize, soybeans, green beans and peanuts). © 2020 Ditdit Nugeraha Utama, Alvali Zaqi Taufan, Al Ghifari Hartzani, Hasfhi Haidi, Yusuf Ramadhan Lubis and Wahyu Sardjono.","Decision support system; Euclidean distance; Food crop; Fuzzy logic; Indonesia",,,,,"Binus University","We would like to thank Bina Nusantara University who has supported and sponsored our studies and works, particularly Bina Nusantara Graduate Program, Master of Computer Science.","Abid, M., Schneider, U.A., Scheffran, J., Adaptation to climate change and its impact on food productivity and crop income: Perspectives of farmers in rural Pakistan (2016) J.

Three types of change for the better are regarding mathematical model, conception in calculating the growth performance parameters, and also data operated practically for testing the proposed algorithm. Three simple stages of study conducted are previous study-re-analyzing and re-reviewing, mathematical model constructing, and model testing. Here, roulette-wheel technique was technically functioned to generate probability of positive and negative factor values; that influence the performance of artificial butterfly's metamorphoses process (also could affect the quality of butterfly finally). Nineteen mathematical equations successfully produced are able to perfect the previous algorithm, particularly in the detailed calculation of performance in every single stage of metamorphoses. Conclusively, a balanced scorecard approach adopted as conception in calculating the company's internal aspect performance that benefited from testing the new improved algorithm. Similar to the previous study, the company's external factors considered as well in stage of model testing. © 2019 IEEE.","balanced scorecard; butterfly lifecycle algorithm; growth performance; improved algorithm; roulette-wheel technique","Wheels; Balanced scorecard approach; Balanced scorecards; External factors; Growth performance; Mathematical equations; Model testing; roulette-wheel technique; Single stage; Well testing",,,,,,"Utama, D.N., Mitchell, A., Fieri, B., Richard, H., A simple butterfly lifecycle algorithm for measuring company growth performance (2019) Annual Conference on Industrial and System Engineering; Melendez-Melendez, G., Cruz-Paz, D., Carrasco-Ochoa, J.A., Martinez-Trinidad, J.F., An improved algorithm for partial clustering (2019) Expert Systems with Application, 121, pp. 282-291; Saha, T., Srivastava, S., Khare, S., Stanimirovic, P.S., Petkovic, M.D., An improved algorithm for basis pursuit problem and its applications (2019) Applied Mathematics and Computation, 355, pp. 385-398; Dora, C., Biswal, P.K., An improved algorithm for efficient ocular artifact supervision from frontal eeg electrodes using vmd Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, , inPress; Azar, Y., Cohen, S., An improved algorithm for online machine minimization (2018) Operation Reseach Letter, 46 (1), pp. 128-133; Bai, W., Eke, I., Lee, K.Y., An improved artificial bee colony optimization algorithm based on orthogonal learning for optimal power flow problem (2017) Control Engineering Practice, 61, pp. 163-172; Kashef, S., Nezzamabadi-Pour, H., An advanced aco algorithm for feature subset selection (2015) Neurocomputing, 147, pp. 271-279; Li, Y., Soleimani, H., Zohal, M., An improved ant colony optimization algorithm for the multi-depot green vehicle routing problem with multiple objectives (2019) Journal of Cleaner Production, 227, pp. 1161-1172; Wang, H., Wu, W., Chen, T., Dong, X., Wang, G., An improved neural network for toc, s1 and s2 estimation based on conventional well logs (2019) Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, 176, pp. 664-678; Sawaguchi, S., Nishi, H., Slightly-slacked dropout for improving neural network learning of fpga (2018) ICT Express, 4 (2), pp. 75-80; Lipowski, A., Lipowska, D., Roulette-wheel selection via stochastic acceptance (2012) Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 391 (6), pp. 2193-2196","Utama, D.N.; BINUS Graduate Program, Indonesia; email: ditdit.utama@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","7th International Conference on Cyber and IT Service Management, CITSM 2019","6 November 2019 through 7 November 2019",,157081,,9781728129099,,,"English","Int.

It means practically 'working together' without considering their dissimilarities and disparities to solve a problem. Specifically in public facility construction, at some time the citizen have to work together to do so with their own capital and resources through donation activity. It occurs century by century. Based on that unique phenomenon, this paper proposes a decision support model (DSM) that fundamentally created based on the GORO spirit to reconstruct the damage. The model is able to suggest the most objective damaged public facility that should be rehabilitated first. The method fuzzy logic is the main method operated in this work. The object-oriented method was used to design and develop a model. The simulated-annealing was functioned as an optimization method to optimize a selected decision.

Determination of the coordinates of the center point (centroid) is generally done by generating random numbers and each instance will then be placed based on proximity to random numbers generated. Determining a good centroid will prevent the occurrence of local optima problems in K-Means. The GenClust++ algorithm is a pretty good algorithm in determining centroid. However, what needs to be considered is the influence of the selection and crossover process on the performance of clustering. This study will discuss the combination of selection and crossover processes that are good in the process of determining the centroid. Performance measurement method will be based on the measurement of Mean Square Error and distance calculation using Euclidean Distance. The results show that the Roulette Wheel Selection and Whole Arithmetic Crossover selection processes will give the best performance for the GenClust++ Algorithm. © 2019 IEEE.","centroid; crossover; GenClust++; K-means; selection","Mean square error; Random number generation; centroid; crossover; GenClust; K-means; selection; K-means clustering",,,,,,"Islam, M.Z., Estivill-Castro, V., Rahman, M.A., Bossomaier, T., Combining k-means and a genetic algorithm through a novel arrangement of genetic operators for high quality clustering (2018) Expert Systems with Applications, 91, pp. 402-417; Lloyd, S., Least squares quantization in pcm (1982) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 28 (2), pp. 129-137; Wu, X., Kumar, V., Quinlan, J.R., Ghosh, J., Yang, Q., Motoda, H., McLachlan, G.J., Steinberg, D., Top 10 algorithms in data mining (2008) Knowledge and Information Systems, 14 (1), pp. 1-37; Maitra, R., Peterson, A.D., Ghosh, A.P., (2010) A Systematic Evaluation of Different Methods for Initializing the K-Means Clustering Algorithm; Maulik, U., Bandyopadhyay, S., Genetic algorithm-based clustering technique (2000) Pattern Recognition, 33 (9), pp. 1455-1465; Rahman, M.A., Islam, M.Z., Crudaw: A novel fuzzy technique for clustering records following user defined attribute weights (2012) Tenth Australasian Data Mining Conference; Zahra, S., Ghazanfar, M.A., Khalid, A., Azam, M.A., Naeem, U., Prugel-Bennett, A., Novel centroid selection approaches for kmeans-clustering based recommender systems (2015) Information Sciences, 320, pp. 156-189; Liu, Y., Wu, X., Shen, Y., Automatic clustering using genetic algorithms (2011) Applied Mathematics and Computation, 218 (4), pp. 1267-1279; Rahman, M.A., Islam, M.Z., A hybrid clustering technique combining a novel genetic algorithm with k-means (2014) Knowledge-Based Systems, 71, pp. 345-365; Beg, A.H., Islam, M.Z., Estivill-Castro, V., Genetic algorithm with healthy population and multiple streams sharing information for clustering (2016) Knowledge-Based Systems, 114, pp. 61-78; Muzid, S., Dinamisasi parameter algoritma genetika menggunakan population resizing on fitness improvement fuzzy evolutionary algorithm (profifea) (2014) Seminar Nasional Teknologi Dan Informatika; He, S., Dai, Y., Zhou, R., Zhao, S., A clustering routing protocol for energy balance of wsn based on genetic clustering algorithm (2012) IERI Procedia, 2, pp. 788-793; Cowgill, M.C., Harvey, R.J., Watson, L.T., A genetic algorithm approach to cluster analysis (1999) Computers & Mathematics with Applications, 37 (7), pp. 99-108; Meng, Y., Liang, J., Cao, F., He, Y., A new distance with derivative information for functional k-means clustering algorithm (2018) Information Sciences, 463-464, pp. 166-185; Ongko, H.E., Abdullah, D., Determining a cluster centroid of k-means clustering using genetic algorithm (2015) International Journal of Computer Science and Software Engineering, 4 (6), pp. 160-164; (2018) Machine Learning Repository, , https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php, UCI [online] Available: [Accessed 6 September",,"Supangkat S.H.Sembiring J.Arman A.A.Nugraha IGB.B.Bandung Y.",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","10th International Conference on ICT for Smart Society, ICISS 2019","19 November 2019 through 20 November 2019",,157204,,9781728148809,,,"English","Proceeding - Int.

Technically, most encryption processes are ranging from hundreds of milliseconds. If there is a lot of encrypting process, then the performance will be getting bottleneck and the transaction's speed is being slowed down. In this paper, a promising scheme by adding GZIP compression on the former RSA encryption method to increase speed is proposed; thus every transaction is going to require less times, therefore the number of failed transactions or requests will be reduced. Hence, this way makes the transaction easier for customers to do. The result of little experimental test shows that using XOR to stream cipher-text to replace the absent of padding into specific bytes shows a lot of performance increase resulting other factors such as availability also affected without sacrificing the security level. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Risk management; Systems engineering; Application Servers; Experimental test; RSA encryption; Security level; Stream Ciphers; Cryptography",,,,,,"Rachmawati, D., Budiman, M.A., Lubis, R.S., (2018) IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 434, pp. 1-6; Baheti, A., Singh, L., Khan, A.U., (2014) IEEE-Fourth International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies, pp. 664-668; Ahmed, M., Sazzad, T.M.S., Mollah, M.E., (2012) Int J Comput Sci Issues, 9, pp. 583-586; Klein, M., (2012) The TSEC/KW-26 (1st Ed.)

DPC practically implemented new tax return processing system to replace the old system, however the performance of the new system was not on a par with the old one, at the beginning. Then, DPC made several improvements to increase new system's performance. This study aims to measure the improvements made by DPC by using Six Sigma approach. The approach is functioned to assess data processing performance through DMAIC concept: i.e. define, measure, analyse, improve, and control. With the DMAIC concept, improvement exposes better result, the average value of six sigma significantly escalated by 0.97 to 2.56. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data handling; Process engineering; Process monitoring; Risk management; Systems engineering; Taxation; Work simplification; Average values; Indonesia; Performance measurements; Processing performance; Processing systems; Six sigma approaches; System's performance; Tax returns; Six sigma",,,,,,"Kaushik, P., Khanduja, D., (2009) Total Qual.

The registered candidates of Hajj pilgrim cannot become Hajj pilgrims all 100%, several of them have to wait in list until years. Based on scientific view, this study was conducted. The objective of study is to construct a computer model based on optimization conception to objectively clarify the current-year Hajj pilgrims. By methodically employing the hill-climbing (HC) method in optimizing process and also applying fuzzy-logic concept in parameterizing parameters, a scheme of 'double-stages fuzzy hill climbing (FHC) optimization' was constructed. Through bearing in mind seven selected parameters, the Hajj pilgrims in restricted quota were determined. The paper provides the detailed configuration of an optimization schema and constructed model. It also delivers the constructed model's simulation result regarding the determined 155,200 Hajj pilgrims (according to 2016 Indonesia Hajj pilgrim quota) for 33 Indonesias provinces from more than 220 thousand dummy (experimental) data of Hajj pilgrim candidates. © 2019 IEEE.","fuzzy hill-climbing; hajj pilgrimage; hajj pilgrims; Indonesia; optimization","Artificial intelligence; Fuzzy logic; Computer modeling; Double stage; hajj pilgrimage; hajj pilgrims; Hill climbing; Indonesia; Optimization modeling; Parameterizing; Optimization",,,,,,"Gautret, P., Benkouiten, S., Griffiths, K., Sridhar, S., The inevitable Hajj cough: Surveillance data in French pilgrims, 2012-2014 (1955) Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease, 13 (6), pp. 485-489; Gautret, P., Benkouiten, S., Al-Tawfiq, J.A., Memish, Z.A., Hajjassociated viral respiratory infections: A systematic review (2016) Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease, 14 (2), pp. 92-109; Sridhar, S., Benkouiten, S., Belhouchat, K., Drali, T., Memish, Z.A., Parola, P., Brouqui, P., Gautret, P., Foot ailments during Hajj: A short report (2015) Journal of Epidemiology and Global Health, 5 (3), pp. 291-294; Shimemeri, A.A., Cardiovascular disease in Hajj Pilgrims (2012) Journal of the Saudi Heart Association, 24 (2), pp. 123-127; Rafiq, S.M., Rashid, H., Haworth, E., Booy, R., Hazards of hepatitis at the Hajj (2009) Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease, 7 (4), pp. 239-246; Abbes, M.B., Abdelhedi-Zouch, M., Does Hajj pilgrimage affect the Islamic investor sentiment?

These two methods are going to be tested operating the same data-set in order to get the comparison result for both methods. The result shows that the hybrid model has a better performance than hill-climbing. Based on the number of global optimum value occurrence, the hybrid model outperformed 7.6% better than hill-climbing, and produced more stable average global optimum value.

This case study discusses how to convalesce IT services using the information technology infrastructure library (ITIL) framework and measure service level management (SLM) using Fuzzy ITIL (FITIL) approach. This paper aims to obtain an appropriate model for the measurement of IT service management by using fuzzy approach. Besides that, this paper aims to be able to provide an improving recommendations and IT governance based on current value (as is) and expected value (to be). The research method functioned is by measuring maturity level using best practice of ITIL v3 to condition before and after of improving process based on a questionnaire that has been performed. After obtaining the value of the maturity level for each cycle within ITIL, then the value will be created as an input for FITIL. The manufacture of FITIL is done in 4 stages, namely fuzzification, knowledge base, inference, and defuzzification. The results of the conditions before and after of the improving process have been successful in increasing the level of maturity in each ITIL cycle. The case study indicates an improvement in the increased level of maturity in SLM with FITIL approach. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study positively proposed a model which is not only able to show the effect of road traffic congestion ecologically, but also can recommend the strategy for road traffic engineering with methodically elaborating the environmental attributes as a dominant aspects considered. It is called as ecological decision support model (eco-DSM). To construct the model, two main methods were operated and combined: fuzzy logic and water flow algorithm (WFA). The method fuzzy logic exploited to exterminate the bias facet on parameters, and the WFA utilised to model the road traffic congestion and vehicle flow and to optimize its velocity based on emission calculation. The constructed model itself was designed thru the method object oriented, and the empirical road traffic congestion data of the Juanda Street in Tangerang Selatan city were functioned. Finally, the model showed the simulation result for suggesting the best decision alternative for road traffic engineering. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

It plays the imperative role to encourage HRs to have a good spirit and become correctly loyal to institution. The major objective of research is to propose a constructed decision support model (DSM) for appraising the HRs performance. The methods object oriented, fuzzy logic, hill climbing, and survey are benefitted to be main methods of this study which respectively are used to analyze and design the constructed model, justify and analyze data values, optimize the suggested decision, and collect data. By scientifically taking into account four selected fundamental performance parameters (i.e. education, teaching capability, research, and community service), the study was conducted; where, the measurement of performance bonus for university lecturer is chosen as a research object. Specifically for collecting data, 35 university lecturers were occupied to estimate the significance level of parameters. The lecturers are coming from two faculties of UIN Syarif Hidayatullah (Jakarta, Indonesia); i.e. faculties of science and technology and communication. At last, the model is practically going to assist the decision makers to fairly assess HRs performance; and the study showed a simulation result of assessment based on forty empirical data of university lecturer. © 2018 IEEE.","decision support model; fuzzy logic; hill climbing; human resources; performance appraisal","Computer circuits; Data acquisition; Decision making; Fuzzy logic; Information management; Personnel; Community services; Decision support models; Hill climbing; Performance appraisal; Performance parameters; Research object; Science and Technology; Significance levels; Decision support systems",,,,,,"Cech, M., Yao, W., Samolejová, A., Li, J., Wicher, P., Human resource management in Chinese manufacturing companies (2016) Perspectives in Science, 7, pp. 6-9; Mohanty, R.P., Deshmukh, S.G., Evolution of a decision support system for human resource planning in a petroleum company (1997) International Journal of Production Economics, 51 (3), pp. 251-261; Utama, D.N., Triana, Y.S., Iqbal, M.M., Iksal, M., Fikri, I., Dharmawan, T., Decision support model for mosque renovation and rehabilitation (Case study: Ten mosques in Jakarta Barat, Indonesia) (2018) IOP Conf.

The congestion negatively affects not only to economy and physiology factors, but also for human environment and health. This paper methodologically represents the development of ecological decision support system based on the concept of fuzzy logic (Fuzzy ecoDSS) for RTE. Three types of core method operated here; fuzzy logic, water flow algorithm (WFA), and object oriented. The method fuzzy logic used to avoid the fuzziness in parameterizing and prioritize the parameters. The WFA approach functioned to replicate the flow of road traffic and optimize it thru RTE. Finally, the method object oriented benefited to analyze and design the constructed system. Thus, the simulation result exhibits the best decision alternative taken gives better air condition (more 200% than normal condition) and better road traffic velocity (more 2,200% than normal situation). © 2018 IEEE.","decision support system; ecology; fuzzy logic; road traffic congestion; road traffic engineering; system development; water flow diagram","Air; Artificial intelligence; Computer circuits; Decision support systems; Ecology; Flow of water; Fuzzy logic; Highway administration; Highway engineering; Hydraulics; Information management; Roads and streets; Human environment; Normal condition; Object oriented; Parameterizing; Road traffic; System development; Water flow algorithms; Water flows; Traffic congestion",,,,,,"Utama, D.N., Zaki, F.A., Munjeri, I.J., Putri, N., Fwfa optimization based decision support system for road traffic engineering (2017) Journal of Physics Conference Series, 801 (1); Bao, Y., Xiao, F., Gao, Z., Gao, Z., Investigation of the traffic congestion during public holiday and the impact of the toll-exemption policy (2017) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 104, pp. 58-81; D.

One of the important things is right decision in issues of supplier selection. The improper supplier affects consequence negatively to the quality of company's business process. Thus, the right way to answer the issues is incredibly crucial to be proposed. This study aims to design an application to determine the sub-criteria weight with Fuzzy-AHP method, select the best supplier via Fuzzy-TOPSIS method, and calculate the allocation of quota to each supplier thru Fuzzy-MOLP method. The study was conducted on high class store by taking the object of material gymnastic product (spandex). Simulation confidently demonstrates that the Fuzzy-AHP approach is able to be operated to generate parameter Quality Product as the best sub-criteria (with value 0.221), the Fuzzy-TOPSIS technique can be used to ring out the supplier (where CV. Maju Jaya Abadi as the best supplier), and the method Fuzzy-MOLP is exploited to calculate the allocation of quota (where CV.

The shape of a roof is a very influential factor shaping a sense of comfort in the house. Henceforth, everyone will have to sort different forms in choosing the proper roof model that makes them feel comfortable. This research developed a mathematical modeling of the temperature distribution of a room that is influenced by the shape of the roof. This research uses different types of roof to be studied, namely, a rectangular house with a straight, triangular, convex and concave roof. Room temperature distribution is analogous to the concept of thermal fluid dynamics equations. Solution heat equation was solved numerically through explicit finite difference method. However, due to the random observation domain, this study uses ghost-point method. This method uses the quadratic extrapolation approach. The development of mathematical models in the program was compiled using python language, so that the program can represent the temperature of the room at any point well. This research shows that a house which with straight roof is the most efficient in terms of heat distribution.

Moreover, two types of optimization method, simulated-annealing and hill-climbing, were functioned in constructing the model and compared to find the most optimal one then. The result said that both methods gave the same result for a value of objective function and the hill-climbing based model consumed the shortest running time. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Simulated annealing; Generic modeling; Hill climbing; Multiparameters; Object oriented method; Objective functions; Optimal values; Optimization method; Optimization problems; Big data",,,,,,"Noor, N.M.M., Retnowardhani, A., Triana, Y.S., Helawani, S.M., The use of fuzzy alpha cut to improve the forecasting range results of the ARIMA model: Assist decision making process (2013) IJIPM: International Journal of Information Processing and Management, 4, pp. 59-71; Xuan, H., Wang, Y., Xu, Z., Hao, S., Wang, X., New optimization model for routing and spectrum assignment with nodes insecurity (2017) Optics Communications, 389, pp. 42-50; Yang, X., Cheng, Y., Development of signal optimization models for asymmetric two-leg continuous flow intersections (2017) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 74, pp. 306-326; Yi, Z., Bauer, P.H., Optimization models for placement of an energy-aware electric vehicle charging infrastructure (2016) Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 91, pp. 227-244; Ma, Y., Gao, Y., Passenger Transportation Structure Optimization Model Based on User Optimum (2016) Procedia Engineering, 137, pp. 202-209; Wang, X., Zhou, F., Xia, T., Xu, M., A multi-objective optimization model to enhance the comprehensive performance of underground gas drainage system (2016) Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering, 36, pp. 852-864; Utama, D.N., Zaki, F.A., Munjeri, I.J., Putri, N.U., FWFA Optimization based Decision Support System for Road Traffic Engineering (2016) 1st International Conference on Computing and Applied Informatics (ICCAI), , (Medan Indonesia); Utama, D.N., Zaki, F.A., Munjeri, I.J., Putri, N.U., A Water Flow Algorithm based Optimization Model for Road Traffic Engineering (2016) International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems (ICACSIS 2016), p. 591. , (Malang Indonesia); Coelho, V.N., Oliveira, T.A., Coelho, I.M., Coelho, B.N., Fleming, P.J., Guimarães, F.G., Ramalhinho, H., Lust, T., Generic Pareto local search metaheuristic for optimization of targeted offers in a bi-objective direct marketing campaign (2017) Computers & Operations Research, 78, pp. 578-587; Gupta, U., Korrapati, S., Matturu, N., Ogras, U.Y., A generic energy optimization framework for heterogeneous platforms using scaling models (2016) Microprocessors and Microsystems, 40, pp. 74-87; Bertran, M.O., Frauzem, R., Zhang, L., Gani, R., A Generic Methodology for Superstructure Optimization of Different Processing Networks (2016) Computer Aided Chemical Engineering, 38, pp. 685-690; Mauricio-Iglesias, M., Montero-Castro, I., Mollerup, A.L., Sin, G., A generic methodology for the optimisation of sewer systems using stochastic programming and self-optimizing control (2015) Journal of Environmental Management, 155, pp. 193-203; Kirkpatrick, S., Gelat, C.D., Vecchi, M.P., Optimization by Simulated Annealing (1983) Science, 220 (4598), pp. 671-680; Černý, V., Thermodynamical approach to the traveling salesman problem: An efficient simulation algorithm (1985) Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications, 45 (1), pp. 41-51; Utama, D.N., (2015) The Optimization of the 3-d Structure of Plants, Using Functional-Structural Plant Models.

It is an important and valuable building to be well managed. For a responsible department or institution (such as Religion or Plan Department in Indonesia), to practically manage a lot of mosques is not simple task to handle. The challenge is in relation to data number and characteristic problems tackled. Specifically for renovating and rehabilitating the damaged mosques, a decision to determine the first damaged mosque priority to be renovated and rehabilitated is problematic. Through two types of optimization method, simulated-annealing and hill-climbing, a decision support model for mosque renovation and rehabilitation was systematically constructed. The method fuzzy-logic was also operated to establish the priority of eleven selected parameters. The constructed model is able to simulate an efficiency comparison between two optimization methods used and suggest the most objective decision coming from 196 generated alternatives. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Fuzzy logic; Simulated annealing; A-center; Decision support models; Efficiency comparisons; Hill climbing; Indonesia; Jakarta; Muslims; Optimization method; Decision support systems",,,,,,"Abdullah, F.H., Majid, N.H.A., Othman, R., Defining issue of thermal comfort control through urban mosque Façade design (2016) Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 234, pp. 416-423; (2017) Data Masjid Dan Mushala Direktorat Urusan Agama Islam Dan Pembinaan Syariah, , http://simas.kemenag.go.id, DBI - Ditjen Bimas Islam [access date: 22 January 2017]; Noor, N.M.M., Retnowardhani, A., Triana, Y.S., Helawani, S.M., The use of fuzzy alpha cut to improve the forecasting range results of the ARIMA model: Assist decision making process (2013) IJIPM: International Journal of Information Processing and Management, 4, pp. 59-71; Piltan, M., Sowlati, T., A multi-criteria decision support model for evaluating the performance of partnerships (2016) Expert Systems with Applications, 45, pp. 373-384; Pattanaik, L.N., Yadav, G., Decision support model for automated railway level crossing system using fuzzy logic control (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 48, pp. 73-76; Kamperis, A.C., Aravossis, K., Tatsiopoulos, I.P., Sotirchos, A., Decision support models for solid waste management: Review and game-theoretic approaches (2013) Waste Management, 33 (5), pp. 1290-1301; Hong, T., Koo, C., Jeong, K., A decision support model for reducing electric energy consumption in elementary school facilities (2012) Applied Energy, 95, pp. 253-266; Beškovnik, B., Twrdy, E., Managing maritime automobile terminals: An approach toward decision-support model for higher productivity (2011) International Journal of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, 3 (4), pp. 233-241; Rosenfeld, Y., Shohet, I.M., Decision support model for semi-automated selection of renovation alternatives (1999) Automation in Construction, 8 (4), pp. 503-510; Ahmad, T., Thaheem, M.J., Anwar, A., Din, Z., Implications of stereotype mosque architecture on sustainability (2016) Procedia Engineering, 145, pp. 96-103; Varzaneh, E.H., Amini, M., Bemanian, M.R., Impact of hot and arid climate on architecture (case study: Varzaneh Jame Mosque) (2014) Procedia Engineering, 94, pp. 25-32; Othman, R., Zainal-Abidin, Z.J., The importance of Islamic art in mosque interior (2011) Procedia Engineering, 20, pp. 105-109; Qaraya, B.A., The civic and culture role of the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque (2015) Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 211, pp. 488-497; Baharudin, N.A., Ismail, A.S., Communal mosques: Design functionality towards the development of sustainability for community (2014) Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 153, pp. 106-120; Zadeh, L.A., Fuzzy logic = computing with words (1996) IEEE Transactions of Fuzzy Systems, 4 (2), pp. 103-111; Mathiassen, L., Munk-Madsen, A., Nielsen, P.A., Stage, J., (2000) Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, , (Aalborg Denmark: Marko Publishing ApS); Kirkpatrick, S., Gelatt, C.D., Vecchi, M.P., Optimization by simulated annealing (1983) Science, 220 (4598), pp. 671-680; Čern, V., Thermodynamical approach to the traveling salesman problem: An efficient simulation algorithm (1985) Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications, 45 (1), pp. 41-51; Utama, D.N., (2015) The Optimization of the 3-d Structure of Plants, Using Functional-Structural Plant Models.

However, the objective strategy type of road traffic engineering could not be proven truly. Try and error is one inefficient way in road traffic engineering to degrade the level of congestion. The combination between fuzzy-logic and water flow algorithm methods (called FWFA) was used as a main method to construct the decision support system (DSS) for selecting the objective strategy in road traffic engineering. The proposed DSS can suggest the most optimal strategy decision in road traffic engineering. Here, a main traffic road of Juanda in area Ciputat, Tangerang Selatan, province Banten, Indonesia; was selected as a research object in this study. The constructed DSS for road traffic engineering was structurally delivered in this paper. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Decision support systems; Flow of water; Fuzzy logic; Highway engineering; Roads and streets; Transportation; Decision support system (dss); Indonesia; Optimal strategies; Research object; Road traffic; Water flow algorithms; Traffic congestion",,,,,,"Utama, D.N., Zaki, F.A., Munjeri, I.J., Putri, N.U., A water flow algorithm based optimization model for road traffic engineering (2016) Proceeding of the 2016 International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems, p. 591. , (Malang Indonesia); He, F., Yan, X., Liu, Y., Ma, L., A traffic congestion assessment method for urban road networks based on speed performance index (2016) Procedia Engineering, 137, pp. 425-433; Xing, J., Tanaka, J., Effective installation of an auxiliary lane at sag sections to mitigate motorway traffic congestion (2016) Transportation Research Procedia, 15, pp. 187-197; Wen, W., A dynamic and automatic traffic light control expert system for solving the road congestion problem (2008) Expert Systems with Applications, 34 (4), pp. 2370-2381. , 4-2381; Tan, Z., Gao, H.O., Traffic control for air quality management and congestion mitigation in complex urban vehicular tunnels (2015) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 58, pp. 13-28; Koshizen, T., A smartphone-based intelligent vehicle system to minimize the possibility of traffic congestion occurrence (2013) IFAC Proceedings, 46, pp. 21-644; Davis, L.C., Mitigation of congestion at a traffic bottleneck with diversion and lane restrictions (2012) Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 391 (4), pp. 1679-1691. , A; Le, T.P.L., Trinh, T.A., Encouraging public transport use to reduce traffic congestion and air pollutant: A case study of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (2016) Procedia Engineering, 142, pp. 236-243; Yang, F.C., Wang, Y.P., Water flow-like algorithm for object grouping problems (2007) Journal of Chinese Institute of Industrial Engineers, 24 (6), pp. 475-488; Brodić, D., Milivojević, Z., An approach to modification of water flow algorithm for segmentation and text parameters extraction (2010) Proceedings of Doctoral Conference on Computing, Electrical, and Industrial Systems, pp. 324-331; Chang, C.C., Wu, T.H., A water flow-like algorithm for celullar manufacturing design and layout (2011) International Conference on Advanced Information Technologies, , ((AIT)); Srour, A., Othman, Z.A., Hamdan, A.R., A water flow-like algorithm for travelling salesman problem (2014) Advances in Computer Engineering, pp. 1-14; Zainudin, S., Kerwad, M.M., Othman, Z.A., A water flow-like algorithm for capacitated vehicle routing problem (2015) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 77, pp. 125-135; Balakhrishnan, S., Sivanandan, R., Influence of lane and vehicle subclass on free-flow speeds for urban roads in heterogeneous traffic (2015) Transportation Research Procedia, 10, pp. 166-175; Zadeh, L.A., Fuzzy logic = computing with words (1996) IEEE Transactions of Fuzzy Systems, 4 (2), pp. 103-111; Mathiassen, L., Munk-Madsen, A., Nielsen, P.A., Stage, J., (2000) Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, , (Denmark: Marko Publishing ApS Aalborg); Turban, E., Aronson, J.E., Liang, T.P., (2005) Decision Support Systems and Intelligent Systems, 7, , (Pearson); Utama, D.N., Saputra, M.D., Wafiroh, L.N., Putra, M.A.A., Lestari, P., F-multicriteria based decision support system for road repair and maintenance (case study: Three areas in Tangerang Selatan, Province Banten, Indonesia) (2016) Proceeding of Academics World 39, pp. 27-31",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Computing and Applied Informatics, ICCAI 2016","14 December 2016 through 15 December 2016",,127044,17426588,,,,"English","J.

A specific information system is scientifically estimated able to escalate the trust level of one community in donating; where, their donation can reinforce them to solve the socioeconomic problem in one region. The concept of fuzzy-logic has been practically embedded in measuring an inequality index of socioeconomic aspect, particularly for health and education sectors. Moreover, the concept of the Euclidean distance measurement is operated to measure the distance value of two parameters (geographical location and inequality).

Thus, an optimal engineering of road traffic is necessary. Here, the optimization model was technically constructed to degrade the congestion level through the conceptual method of water flow algorithm (WFA). The model was analyzed and designed as well via object oriented instruments. Three major direct parameters (i.e. road traffic delay, density, and degree of saturation) support to optimize the road traffic velocity. Finally, the proposed model can recommend a decision that will be engaged to re-engineer the road traffic. The suggested decision exposes an improved velocity condition of traffic flow.

Several aspects should be taken into account to locate the restaurant in the right location to give owners high profit or gain; e.g. population income, city type, trading activity behavior, location distance to hustle in the city, etc. In addition, the simulated annealing (SA) was used as a main method for optimizing process. The other method fuzzylogic was operated as well to define the selected parameters’ priority based on experts’ justification. The decision support model (DSM) based on SA-optimization and fuzzy-concept was constructed then. It practically proposed the best location alternative coming from a lot of alternatives. Here, three locations in Tangerang and Jakarta were undertaken as a research object. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Intelligent systems; Location; Simulated annealing; Activity behavior; Decision support models; Fast-food restaurants; Fuzzy concept; Jakarta; Priority-based; Research object; Decision support systems",,,,,,"Černý, V., Thermodynamical approach to the traveling salesman problem: An efficient simulation algorithm (1985) J.

It would be difficult to be adopted, because in the real case, the supply path has multi objectives. It is a need to improve the ant colony optimization for multiobjectives case. The objective of this paper is improve the ant colony optimization for solving multi objectives based supply path problem by using fuzzy ant colony optimization. The developed multi objectives fuzzy ant colony optimization was used to search the most optimum path of palm oil based bioenergy supply chain. The method was validated and verified with a real data set and the finding was analyzed and discussed. © 2011 Universitas Indonesia.",,"Ant-colony optimization; Bioenergy supplies; Data sets; Multi objective; Palm oil; Path problems; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Information systems; Supply chains; Vegetable oils; Algorithms",,,,,,"Alsawy, A.A., Hefny, H.A., Fuzzy-Based Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (2010) Proc. 2 nd International Computer Technology and Development (ICCTD) Conf, 2010, pp. 530-534; Alsawy, A.A., Hefny, H.A., El-Licy, F., Fuzzy Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (2010) Proc. 7 th Informatics and Systems (INFOS) Conf, 2010, pp. 1-5; Bianchi, L., Gambardella, L.M., Dorigo, M., Solving the homogeneous probabilistic travelling salesman problem by the ACO meta-heuristic (2002) Proceeding ANTS '02, 3rd International Workshop on Ant Algorithms, pp. 177-187; Birattari, M., Balaprakash, P., Dorigo, M., ACO / F-Race: Ant colony optimization and racing techniques for combinatorial optimization under uncertainty (2005) Proceedings of MIC 2005 - 6 thMetaheuristics International Conference, pp. 107-112; Bolstorff, P., Rosenbaum, R., (2007) Supply Chain Excellence - A Handbook for Dramatic Improvement Using the SCOR Model, , Amacom; Chiou, J.S., Wang, K.Y., Shieh, M.Y., The Optimization of the Application of Fuzzy Ant Colony Algorithm in Soccer Robot (2009) Proc.

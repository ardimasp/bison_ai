The purpose of this research is to describe the creatives process and technical approach using digital sculpting that focus on shape and texture design of wayang kulit character, especially in 'Buto' type of character, which is refers to giant monster based on humanoid wayang type. The methods of this research combine literatures study and experimental 3D CG model character creation. The analysis result is to gain alternative visualization in character design, focus on shape and texture from conceptual to visualization aesthetic that inspired by Wayang Buto type characterization. © 2019 IEEE.","3D Character Design; Digital Sculpting; Javanese Wayang Kulit; Shape Design; Texture Design","3D modeling; Sustainable development; Visualization; 3D characters; Character designs; Cultural aspects; Cultural assets; Digital Sculpting; Javanese Wayang Kulit; Shape and textures; Shape designs; Textures",,,,,"Damono, S.D., Alih Wahana, 2018; Teeuw, A., (1983) Membaca Dan Menilai Sastra : Kumpulan Karangan.

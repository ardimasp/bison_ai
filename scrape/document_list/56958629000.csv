The paper uses a qualitative research method and discusses the availability of the material and the preparation of schools to use the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) method in the Informatics as the new subject. STEM is a solution to encourage students to have skills that are suitable for the needs of the workplace today. The researcher collected the data using the literature study method, as well as the distribution of questionnaires and interviews with school leaders. This research shows that the content of the subject can meet STEM standards. Also, schools are ready to implement the Informatics in terms of system, teachers, and facilities. However, the government that launched the concept and asked the schools to implement the idea didn't support the school well and tended to push the autonomy of schools. © 2020 IEEE.","curriculum; higher-order thinking skills (HOTS); problem solving; STEM; Technology 4.0","Educational technology; Informatics; Students; Surveys; Literature studies; New approaches; Qualitative research methods; School leaders; Science , technology , engineering , and mathematics; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,"(2018) Kemendikbud, Permendikbud RI 37 Tahun 2018 Tentang Perubahan Atas Permendikbud 24 Tahun 2016 Tentang KI Dan KD Pelajaran Pada Kurikulum 2013 Pada Pendidikan Dasar Dan Menegah, , Jakarta: Kemendikbud; Torlakson, T., Innovate: A blueprint for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in california public education (2014) State Superintendent of Public Instruction; White, D.W., What Is stem education and why is it important (2014) Florida Assoc.

Indonesia, being a very big and plural country, has a tremendous local wisdom that can promote the country in many aspects: political, economic, cultural, and in the educational sector. One of the main issues in the local wisdom is the local content. This research is trying to investigate the local content found in the reading passages in the local English textbooks used in Indonesian high schools. The research shows that many local English textbooks do not include local content in their reading passages. The problem arises due to the fact that many authors and or publishers are not aware of the importance of such local wisdom in their textbook writing. Another problem is due to the hegemony of so called the ideology of political identity within one nation which affects the philosophy of textbook writing in the respected country. By doing the research, it is hoped that many Indonesian authors write the reading passages which promote the local content in order to highlight the local wisdom of the country to other countries in the world. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Engineering education; Educational sectors; High school; Indonesia; Local contents; Textbooks",,,,,"Andarab, M.S., Calling for English for specific cultures-based course books in English as an international language era (2014) International Journal of English Language Education, 2; Bell, J., Gower, R., Tomlinson, B., (1998) Materials Development in Language Teaching, pp. 116-129; Byram, M., Morgan, C., (1994) Teaching and Learning Language and Culture; Chao, T.-C., The hidden curriculum of cultural content in internationally published ELT textbooks: A closer look at new American inside out (2011) The Journal of Asia TEFL, 8, pp. 189-210; Choudhury, M.H., Teaching culture in EFL: Implications, challenges and strategies (2013) IOSR Journal of Humanities and Social Science (IOSR-JHSS), 13 (1), pp. 20-24; Frank, J., Raising cultural awareness in the English language classroom (2013) English Teaching Forum, 4; Hermawan, B., Traces of Cultures in English Textbooks for Primary Education (2012) Indonesian Journal of Applied Linguistics, 1; Hilliard, A.D., A critical examination of representation and culture in four English language textbooks (2014) Language Education in Asia, 5; Jiangqiong, Q., Tin, T.B., Tomlinson, B., Masuhara, H., (2010) Research for Materials Development in Language Learning, pp. 83-102; Kachru, B.B., World Englishes: Agony and ecstasy (1996) Journal of Aesthetic Education, Special Issue: Distinguished Humanities Lectures II, 30 (2), pp. 135-155; Kawar, T.I., Cross-cultural differences in management (2012) International Journal of Business and Social Science, 3; Kilickaya, F., Guidelines to evaluate cultural content in textbooks (2004) The Internet TESL Journal, 10; Liu, S., Laohawiriyanon, C., Cultural content in EFL listening and speaking textbooks for Chinese university students (2013) International Journal of English Language Education, 1; Neff, P., Tasks for integrating language and culture teaching (2013) English Teaching Forum, 2, pp. 12-20; Pardo, N.A., Téllez, M.F., ELT materials: The key to fostering effective teaching and learning settings (2009) PROFILE Issues in Teachers' Professional Development, 11, pp. 171-186; Pulverness, A., Tomlinson, B., (2003) Developing Materials for Language Teaching, pp. 107-129; Richards, J.C., (2001) Curriculum Development in Language Teaching; Rubby, R., Tomlinson, B., (2003) Developing Materials for Language Teaching, pp. 37-57; Tomlinson, B., Tomlinson, B., (2003) Developing Materials for Language Teaching, pp. 107-129; Yule, G., (2010) The Study of Language","Sapoetra, J.; Primary Teacher Education Department, Indonesia; email: jsapoetra@binus.edu","Vaidyanathan S.Mamat M.B.Lien C.-H.Ginta T.L.MujiartoSambas A.",,"Institute of Physics Publishing","2nd International Conference on Computer, Science, Engineering, and Technology, ICComSET 2019","15 October 2019 through 16 October 2019",,159200,17426588,,,,"English","J.

The form of discipline is a non punitive method that will shape and adjust the behavior of the six students in the first grade at Quantum Change Academy who are still in transition stage that are very impulsive and inattentive. The purpose of the study is to analyze the effect of the positive discipline method on the students’ self regulatory skills and interpersonal skills. It is a mixed-methods research that is when qualitative and quantitative methods are given equal priority and at once. The research was based on the verified information with triangulation data collections consisting of checklist of Self regulatory skills and Interpersonal skills, field observation by video recording and informal interview with the parents and the homeroom teacher and parents’ questionnaire and students’simple self-assessment. The result of the treatment of Positive Discipline Method, Which was done in six weeks produced a considerable effect on students’ self regulatory skills and interpersonal skills. The students were able to get along with peers and able to work autonomously, and those two indicators could be concluded that they were egocentric at first, however they were able to work together cordially at the end. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.","Interpersonal skills; Nonpunitive method; Positive discipline method; Self regulatory sills; Semi experimental qualitative research; Statistic descriptive",,,,,"Binus University","Ahlin, T.H., Rose, A., (2009) Positive descipline, A Guide for Parents, , St.Paul: University of Minnesota; Berk, L.E., (2010) Development through the Lifespan, , 5th edn., Boston, Pearson Education Inc; Chadsey, T., Jody, M., (2006) The Positive Discipline School, , www.posdis.org, August, (Accessed July 5, 2013); Cohrssen, C., Amelia, C., Collette, T., (2011) Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework, , Evidence Paper, University of Melbourne, Melbourne; Geldard, K., David, G., (2013) Working with children in groups a handbook for counsellors, , Educators and Community Workers, Palgrave Macmillan- Pustaka Pelajar, Yogyakarta; Isaksen, S.G., Brian, K.D., Donald, J.T., (2011) Creative approach to problem solving, A Framework for Innovation and Change, , Thousand Oaks, Sage Publiction.

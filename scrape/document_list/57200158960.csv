That reason makes Indonesia becoming a place that is interesting to be visited by many tourists either local or international. Every year the number of tourists who visited Indonesia has greatly increased1,2 and transformed the tourism to be an important sector for Indonesia economical. The rapid development of tourism sector in Indonesia must be equilibrated by the evolution of technology and the supported facilities. Now, the usage of a smartphone technology is one of the important things and a part of modern people daily activities. By taking the advantages of a smartphone, this study is conducted to develop an android application that is named Smart Travelling. Smart travelling has many features that can facilitate every tourist who visited Indonesia, such as recognizes any tourist attractions, shows any events that nearby visited attractions, displays the nearest police station and hospital for an emergency case, and saves the history of the recognized objects. The main idea of the tourist attractions recognition here is to implement an image recognition using landmark detection feature from Google Cloud Vision Application Program Interface (API)3 technology which helps the tourist to easily remember and access any information regarding the visited attractions. In this study, the result is a completed application which is evaluated using questionnaires to 35 randomly selected participants. Based on the evaluation, the smart travelling achieves positive inputs and mostly the participants agree that the image recognition feature is really helping them. Furthermore, we also obtained a significant result for the scan landmark testing, which is 86% for the accuracy. © 2017 The Authors.

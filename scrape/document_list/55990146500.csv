Mandatory drug testing at schools was a strong deterrent against school violence and illegal drug possession on school ground. This system can help teachers, students and parents to be aware of the danger of drug that impacts all students. Furthermore, this new online portal design can assist the counseling department to organize the repository much better than before which was used a manual system. There were some methods used to design this system that implemented through people, technology and process. The methods that were used to collect all supporting data involved surveys, observations, and interviews. Phases in the software development life cycle were followed during the online portal creation. The study showed that this drug testing online portal really helped all parties that were part of this system especially the counselors who have access to the historical data that can provide student progress. This progress report can be communicated to the parents in a timely manner. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Counseling department; Drug testing; Health division; On-line portal",,,,,,"Parsai, M.B., Castro, F.G., Marsiglia, F.F., Harthun, M.L., Valdez, H., Using community based participatory research to createa culturally grounded intervention for parents and youth to prevent risky behaviors (2010) Society for Prevention Research, 12 (1), pp. 34-47; Herrera, C., Grossman, J.B., Kauh, T.J., McMaken, J., Mentoring in schools: An impact study of big brothers big sisters school-based mentoring (2011) Journal Child Development, 82, pp. 346-361; Shillingford, M.A., Lambie, G.W., Williamsburg, M., Contribution of professional school counselors' values and leadership practices to their programmatic service delivery (2010) American School Counselor Association, 13 (4); Gerada, C., Gilvarry, E., Random drug testing in schools in british (2005) Journal of General Practice, 55, pp. 499-501; Ludtke, D., An Investigation of Random Drug Testing as a Preventative Measure to Inhibit Drug Use in College Students, , http://digitalcommons.olivet.edu/edd_diss/252011; Deshmukh, N., Petróczi, N., Barker, J., Székely, A.D., Hussain, I., Naughton, D.P., Potentially harmful advantage to athletes: Aputative connection between UGT2B17 gene deletion polymorphism and renal disorders with prolonged use of anabolic androgenic steroids (2010) Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy, 5 (7); Whitten, J., Bentley, L., Dittman, K., (2007) Systems Analysis and Designs Method, , Seventh Edition.

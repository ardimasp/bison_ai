Based on the results of this research concluded that LinkedIn's social Media acceptability in Indonesia has a positive response towards its users where there is a significant relationship for Ease of Use (EU), Critical Mass (CM), Capability (CP) and Trustworthiness (TW) towards continuity of use of the LinkedIn application. This LinkedIn can continue to be used as a platform to improve the professional network for its users. Trustworthiness (TW) is a variable in which respondents to be trusted to this application. It found that Indonesian people were open to disclose their education and work history to the public, without fear of being abused by third parties.

IT Function in this company is one of the functions that work under Directorate of Finance, this IT Function has a responsible to provide some services for the child of XYZ company or the other Directorates that work under of the XYZ Company. The purpose of this research is to make readers know about Domains of COBIT 5 that can be used in the IT Function to make controlling in IT Project Management, determining level of IT Project Management performance in the IT Function, and also managing the framework that can be used to optimize IT Project Management Currently. The method that the Author used for this research is COBIT 5 Framework, and the method that the Author used to get some data with interview & questionnaire. Process of COBIT 5 that selected and relevant to face some issues that related IT Project Management such as EDM04 (Ensure Resource Optimization), BAI01 (Managing Programs and Projects), BAI03 (Managing Identification & Build Solutions), BAI06 (Managing Change), DSS06 (Manage Business Process Control) and MEA02 (Monitoring, Evaluate, and Assess). Based on the calculations that the Author had done, the score of capability rate in this IT function is 1.33, and also this IT Function has a target and plan for their future, that's about having a plan to reach level 3.00. It means, this IT Function has a GAP score 1,67. Recommendations from the Author that can be aimed and also be used for this IT Function to help making this Function be better is, to starting and doing some of the IT Processes from COBIT 5 that the Author had selected and calculated, such as EDM04, BAI03, DSS06, MEA02, because the IT Processess of COBIT 5 are still below the prescribed minimum standard, that's 85%. © 2018, Little Lion Scientific.

This is very important because the employee tacit knowledge is potentially lost (knowledge walkout) due to employee turnover during a company's knowledge is not well documented using the system. PT Mahadana Dasha Utama (MahaDasha) is one of the company has been adopting e-learning system. MahaDasha is an investment holding company with several business units. MahaDasha uses open source moodle learning management system technology platform. The idea is triggered by the company's efficiency program in information technology investment both infrastructure and application development so it enforce MahaDasha’s IT team to find out the best innovation solution by optimizing open source technology which suitable with the user's need. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of e-learning adoption based on open source moodle technology platform by developing The DeLone & McLean Information Success Model and empirically measured the relation between aspect of information quality, system quality, service quality, user readiness and user satisfaction. The quantitative data are gained through questionnaire by distributing the questionnaires to all MahaDasha employees who use e-learning. The analysis of data indicated that the user satisfaction is the most positive influenced by information quality and user readiness. The contribution of this research was performed by evaluation process both for quality of trainer and IT support team based on result of the research. In the other hand, the system quality had been re-reviewed whether moodle application is suitable or not for user needs in MahaDasha. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS","Application; E-learning; Knowledge management system; Learning management system; Open source",,,,,,"Jafari, S.M., Salem, S.F., Moaddab, M.S., Salem, S.O., Learning Management System (LMS) success: An investigation among the university students (2016) 2015 IEEE Conf.

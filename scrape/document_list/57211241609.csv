GCM data is generally ill-conditioned, which is high dimension and multicollinearity, so a special technique is needed to handle this poorly conditioned. One of the variable selection techniques and handling of multicollinearity which is currently highly developed is regularization techniques including Adaptive Lasso, where selective parameters are adaptive, which can differ for each regression coefficient. Until now, predictions of extreme rainfall in Indonesia have not used Adaptive Lasso in SD modeling. This paper aims to predict the amount of rainfall (in millimeters) at moderate extreme (quantile 0.75) and high extreme rainfall (quantile 0.9 da 0.95) and handling poorly conditioned GCM data with Adaptive Lasso techniques and building predictive models of local rainfall by utilizing GCM data using the Bayes quantile regression model. Response in the form of monthly rainfall at Indramayu district, West Java Indonesia, and 49 explanatory variables in the form of GCM precipitation data in the period January 1981 - December 2013, which handled multicollinearity and variable selection using the Adaptive Lasso. The results are very satisfying with correlation between predicted and real data is above 0.91 for and the RMSEP is less than 50. © 2019 The Authors.

The comparison is in terms of Database response time. Their performance is compared using a common CRUD operations. Each operations data is analyzed using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test. Our comparison results confirm that Firebase Realtime Database is more suitable as our Daily Nutritional Needs Mobile Application Database Management System since it could perform better response time. The key features match our needs to provide Realtime Data and it is also help simplify the process of developing applications. © 2019 The Authors.

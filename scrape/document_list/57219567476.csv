With a joint scheme, investors can buy a portion of project or business ownership with a relatively small nominal purchase. However, investors need tools to facilitate the search and purchase of projects or businesses that match their character. This research is intended to design a Web-based Crowdfunding Platform model that suits the needs of investors. This study uses the questionnaire method to obtain investor information requirements data. As for model designing, this study employed the Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) method, and used notation from the Unified Modeling Language (UML) standard. The result of this study is a Web-based Crowdfunding Platform model that facilitates investors to choose and arrange investment portfolios that are appropriate to their preferences. © 2020 IEEE.","Crowdfunding; Model; OOAD; UML","Information management; Investments; Object oriented programming; Purchasing; Unified Modeling Language; Websites; Business ownership; Information requirement; Investment portfolio; Object oriented analysis and design; Platform models; Stock exchange; Web based; Crowdsourcing",,,,,"Crowdfunding is a method of raising funds from many investors through an online platform to capitalize on startup company project instead of funding from banks or loan providers [7].

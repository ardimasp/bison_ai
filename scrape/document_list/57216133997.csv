In the making of this application, literature review and questionaire are being used as data colletion methodology and extreme programming is being used as research methodology. The goals in making this application is the application can store a physical card into digital form, scan barcode from member card, show realtime promo, online registration, and showing nearest retail location using Android Studio with Java programming language. The conclusion of this research is, this application can help the user as media to avoid careless user in using the card in physical form. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","application; barcode; member card; online registration; physical card; promo; retail location","Applications; Bar codes; Computer programming; Digital storage; member card; Online registration; physical card; promo; Retail locations; Android (operating system)",,,,,"Listiyani, D., (2017) Okezonetechno, , https://techno.okezone.com:https://techno.okezone.com/read/2017/08/10/207/1753147/wow-50-juta-orang-indonesia-senang-belanja-online, (August 10); Hartati, E.R., (2018) Beritasatu, , http://www.beritasatu.com, (May 25); (2015) Manfaat Kartu Membership Untuk Keuangan Anda, , https://www.futuready.com/artikel/berita/manfaat-kartu-membership-untuk-keuangan-anda/, Futuready (May 9).

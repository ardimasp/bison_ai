In this paper, Multi-Objective is used to solve problems with mathematical models and is applied to overcome nurse scheduling problems. Health is one of the essential things in human life. There are some departments in the hospital which serve the patients in the hospital, and one of them is the nursing department. The nurses in this department serve the patients every time, but they have limited time as the working hour must not be more than schedule 8 hours. So, there will be a problem in this aspect, especially the working for each nurse because the nurses must be stand by to serve the patients every time. The scheduled operation will be complicated, so we propose a solution by Genetic Algorithm method. The scheduling making by applying Genetic Algorithm method will give more optimal and faster output comparing with a current or manual process. © BEIESP.","Genetic algorithm; Multi-objective; Nurse; Nurse scheduling; Optimizing; Scheduling problem",,,,,,"McCartney, G., Popham, F., McMaster, R., Cumbers, A., Defining health and health inequalities (2019) Public Health, 172, pp. 22-30; Yeung, T., Local health department adoption of electronic health records and health information exchanges and its impact on population health (2019) International Journal of Medical Informatics, 128, pp. 1-6; Bard, J.F., Purnomo, H.W., Cyclic preference scheduling of nurses using a lagrangian-based heuristic (2007) Journal of Scheduling, 10, pp. 5-23; Tsai, C.C., Li, S.H.A., A two-stage modeling with genetic algorithms for the nurse scheduling problem (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36, pp. 9506-9512; Warner, M., Scheduling Nursing Personnel According to Nursing Preference: A mathematical programming approach (1976) Operations Research, 24, pp. 842-856; Banet, D., Heuristic scheduling for clinical physicians (2009) Thinkir: The University of Louisville's Institutional Repository; Knjazew, D., A competent genetic algorithm for solving permutation and scheduling problems (2002) Genetic Algorithms and Evolutionary Computation, 6. , Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, ISBN: 0792374606; Dodaro, C., Maratea, M., (2017) Nurse Scheduling via Answer Set Programming”, , Springer International Publishing AG; Chen, T., Li, J., Jin, P., Cai, G., Reusable rocket engine preventive maintenance scheduling using genetic algorithm (2013) Reliability Engineering & System Safety, 114, pp. 52-60; Baker, K.R., (1974) Introduction to Sequencing and Scheduling, , New York; Singh, J., Auluck, N., (2017) Controlled Duplication Scheduling of Real-Time Precedence Tasks on Heterogeneous Multiprocessors, pp. 3-21. , Spriger International Publishing; Agyei, W., Obeng-Denteh, W., Andaam, E., Modeling Nurse Scheduling Problem Using 0-1 Goal Programming: A Case Study Of Tafo Government Hospital, Kumasi-Ghana (2015) INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH, 4 (3). , MARCH; Mubarak, S., (2015) Construction Project Scheduling and Control”, , New Jersey: Sons Inc; Cheng, M.Y., Prayogo, D., (2014) Symbiotic Organisms Search: A New Metaheuristic Optimization Algorithm, , Elsevier; Branke, J., Deb, K., Miettinen, K., Slowinski, R., (2014) Multiobjective Optimization, , Germany: Springer; Haupthaupt, R., (2004) Pratical Genetik Algorithms, , New Yersy: John Wiley and Sons,Inc; Hiassat, A., Diabat, A., Rahwanc, I., (2017) A Genetic Algorithm Approach for Location-Inventory-Routing Problem with Perishable Products, , Elsevier; Gencheng, M., “Genetik Algorithm for Scheduling of Laboratory personnel (1997) Clinical Chemistry, pp. 118-123; Pinedo, M.L., (2012) Scheduling: Theory, Algorithms, and Systems, , USA: Springer-Verlag New York","Wibowo, A.; Computer Science Department, Indonesia; email: a.wibowo2003@gmail.com",,,"Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication",,,,,22773878,,,,"English","Int.

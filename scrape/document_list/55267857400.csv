Puzzles in the escape room traditionally have disadvantages because the type of puzzle that is made requires a lot of material. The purpose of this research is to produce a game with Escape Room as the basic theme with Virtual Reality technology. Virtual Reality technology is used to develop presence in users, attendance is about the intimacy of users with the gaming world. By using Virtual Reality, the puzzle elements that are created can be replaced regularly without the need to change the building's skeleton. The development method used is a prototype model using Unity game machines. The research method was carried out using a questionnaire for user analysis. The application generated from this research is the Escape Room VR game that can be played on an Android smartphone that is compatible with Samsung Gear VR. The application can be used as an additional means for traditional Escape Room games. © 2019 The Authors.

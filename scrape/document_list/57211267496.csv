Currently the mobile application gets data from the ERP system by importing and exporting it so that the data used is not real-time. To support the creation of real-time data communication between ERP systems and mobile applications, a replacement method for the export and import process is needed. Therefore, this study makes several web services that can be used to replace the export and import processes through the integration of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) with mobile applications using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Web services are made using RESTful and have passed several stages of testing using the QOS standard. Based on the results of testing using Jmeter with a simulation of 20 users obtained latency on the web service is 3 seconds and 4 seconds load time with an average data size of 2599 bytes so it can be concluded that this quality is quite good in terms of performance and accessibility. Test results using vooky show no bugs, but there are still shortcomings in security, which are caused by the lack of security in the header. With the results of these tests, the webservice can be used to replace the export and import process that have been used by the salesperson, so the data communication between ERP and mobile applications becomes real-time. © 2019 IEEE.","ERP; RESTful; SOA; WEB SERVICE","Convolutional codes; Enterprise resource planning; Information management; Information services; Mobile computing; Real time systems; Web services; Websites; Data-communication; Enterprise resource planning (ERP); Import process; Mobile applications; Multi-national companies; Real-time data communication; Replacement methods; RESTful; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,"Monk, E.F., Wagner, B.J., (2009) Concept in Enterprise Resource Planning, Course Tecnology Cengage Learning; Holmberg, N., Johansson, B., De Carvalho, R.A., How to gain synchronization between business processes and enterprise resource planning systems: A soa based perspective on erp implementation (2013) Researchgate; Holmberg, N., Johansson, B., (2017) A Service Oriented Perspective of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems, 8 (2); Rathod, D., Registry for restful web service: Restregistry (2017) International Journal of Research GRANTHAALAYAH, 5 (7), pp. 128-135; Beltrána, J.V.E., Iglesiasb, V.G., Fernándezb, D.R., Enabling distributed manufacturing resources through SOA: The REST approach (2017) Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 46, pp. 156-165; Navdeep, D., Parmar, N., Soa and rest synergistic approach (2014) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technologies, 5 (6), pp. 7045-7049; Wagh, K.D., Thool, R.D., A comparative study of soap vs rest web services provisioning techniques for mobile host (2015) Journal of Information Engineering and Applications, 2 (5), pp. 2224-5782; (2000) E.

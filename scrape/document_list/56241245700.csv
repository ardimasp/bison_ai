This research has two different models which the emphasis of pedagogy variable was divided into two concept: in blended and traditional learning combine with online learning. The research model tested with quantitative data using SPSS Amos, where the total respondents were 415 students from various majors. This research adopt research model from Khan, and add new variable, industrial partnership and collaboration as part of the research. The result from this research, that the most important factor when the higher education adopt the blended learning concept is readiness and commitment of the institutions, both in resources and technology. Another thing that is also an important concern in the application of blended learning is fostering and understanding how to educate students about the learning model itself. © 2018 IEEE.","blended learning; blended learning model; evaluation; higher education","Education computing; Industrial research; Information management; Students; Blended learning; evaluation; Higher education; Industrial partnerships; Learning models; Quantitative data; Research models; Traditional learning; E-learning",,,,,,"Porter, Blended learning in higher education: Institutional adoption and implementation (2014) Journal of Computer & Education Elsevier, 75, pp. 185-195; Means, The Effectiveness of Online and Blended Learning: A Meta-Analysis of the Empirical Literature (2013) Teacher Collage Record, 115, pp. 1-47. , March 2013 Colombia University; Ncgin, M., Dennis, A., Bob, F., A blended learning framework for curriculum design and professional development (2015) Research in Learning Technology, 23; Heather, S., Horn Michael, B., Classifying K-12 Blended Learning (2012) Innosight Institute Publications, , May 2012; Picciano Anthony, G., Introduction to blended learning : Research perspective (2014) Blended Learning Research Perspective, 2, pp. 1-9. , ISBN:978-0-415-63250-8.

It has entered every part of human life and also became one of the most significant contributors to make human life more manageable. Reporting a problem of facilities and infrastructure in Universitas Prima Indonesia was done manually where the complainant have to meet the responsible person directly and describe how the problem looks like. Then, the responsible person only solve the problem but have no good documentation on it like Five Ws and How. Moreover, the other issue is to avoid a person who is mischievous for giving false reports. In this paper, we applied a set of procedures called Universitas Prima Indonesia Problem Management System (UNPRI-PMS) which also integrated with academic information system. Implemetation of UNPRI-PMS affects all of the problems about facilities and infrastructure at Universitas Prima Indonesia can be solved more efficient, structured, and accurate. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data privacy; Information management; Network security; Human lives; Indonesia; Problem management; Responsible person; Web-based infrastructure; Problem solving",,,,,"This research was supported by the Computer Science Departement, Computer Science, Universitas Prima Indonesia (UNPRI) Medan.","Dharma, A., Turnip, M., Aisyah, S., Infrastruktur Sistem Informasi Murah Berbasis Cloud Dengan Saas di Universitas Prima Indonesia (2016) Prosiding Seminar Nasional Inovasi Dan Teknologi Informasi (SNITI-3); Ismail, Z.A., Kasim, N., Improving Maintenance Management Practices on Conventional Method at Malaysian Polytechnic, Proceedings International Conference of Technology Management (2012) Business and Entrepreneurship 2012, , ICTMBE2012; Lazim, M.H.M., Samad, N.A.A., Masalah Melaporkan Kerosakan Komputer di Jabatan Teknologi Maklumat dan Komunikasi, Politeknik Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin (2011) Politeknik Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin Digest (PTSS Digest); Myeda, N.E., Nizam Kamaruzzaman, S., Pitt, M., Measuring the performance of office buildings maintenance management in Malaysia (2011) Journal of Facilities Management, 9, pp. 1472-5967; Hassan, S., (2010) Developing Online Help Desk for Politeknik Tuanku Sultanah Bahiyah, , (Universiti Utara Malaysia) Master's Thesis; Pradifta, Y., Terttiaavini, Suryati, Sistem Infomasi Seleksi Berkas Lamaran Calon Guru Secara Online Pada Sma Lti Indo Global Mandiri Palembang (2015) JURNAL INFORMATIKA GLOBAL, 6; Rodriguez, Daniel, Harrison, R., Satpathy, M., A generic model and tool support for assessing and improving Web processes 200 Software Metrics, 2002.

The services are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS). This development of cloud computing align with the development of computer in this new age which turn people to work mobile and faster. Cloud computing could be one of the new tools in supporting learning process for students in Higher Education. In student age, they are more familiar with gadget and internet. We do not exactly know how cloud computing can be helpful for lecturer or students. We also want to know the role of cloud computing for the higher education learning process. But, before we are going to see the impact of cloud computing, for the initial stage of the study, we conducted a research to analyze the factors that influence the lecturers and students in using cloud computing to efficiency process. This research conducted using the Theory of Planned Behavior to obtain the result. Finally, the factors that affected the lecturers and students intensity of using cloud computing are attitude, behavioral control, and subjective norm. This result shows that lecturers and students ready to adopt cloud computing and they're already familiar in using it. Furthermore, institution will easier to implement cloud computing for efficiency process. © 2016 IEEE.","Attitude; Behavioral Control; Cloud Computing; Subjective Norm; Theory of Planned behavior","Cloud computing; Computation theory; Education; Efficiency; Information management; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS); Learning systems; Network function virtualization; Platform as a Service (PaaS); Software as a service (SaaS); Technology transfer; Attitude; Behavioral control; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Learning process; New age; Subjective norm; Theory of Planned Behavior; Students",,,,,,"Martson, S., Li, Z., Bandyopadhyay, S., Zhang, J., Ghalsasi, A.

We obtain our dataset which is taken by using a web crawling method from www.cnnindonesia.com. First of all, the document will first undergo some Text Preprocessing method in the form of Lemmatization and Stopwords Removal. The reason we are doing the Text Preprocessing step before anything else is to minimize the noise in the document. Next, we apply Feature Selection onto the document to further separate important words and less important words inside the document. After applying Feature Selection, the document will be classified by the classifier. We are comparing the TF-IDF and SVD algorithm for feature selection, while also comparing the Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Multivariate Bernoulli Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine for the Classifiers. Based on the test results, the combination of TF-IDF and Multinomial Naïve Bayes Classifier gives the highest result compared to the other algorithms, which precision is 0.9841519 and its recall is 0.9840000. The result outperform the previous similar study that classify news article in Indonesian language which obtained 85% of accuracy. © 2017 The Authors.

Higher education information system generates many transactional data; and the amount of those data is increased day by day, but the use of data has not been explored optimally. Each data stored at data storage media is issued for separate purposes. On the other hand, a higher education organization needs to gain overall knowledge from all data. Based on these conditions, organization needs an analytical tool to extract information and discover valuable knowledge from huge amount of data. These processes require more processing time and more complex process. The purpose of this research was to design the data warehouse model and dashboard for analytical tool and use data mining technique for higher education institutions. The research method began with designing the knowledge needs; designing and developing transformation model to data warehouse; using data mining techniques and designing dashboard for analytical tool.

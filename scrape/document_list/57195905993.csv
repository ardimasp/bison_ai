Besides Bitcoin, there is another altcoin which rapidly developing and dominating the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the factors that affect Ethereum prices through macroeconomic aspects, such as EUR/USD exchange rate and the price of gold, as well as Bitcoin and other altcoins prices in the cryptocurrency market. The time series data consists of weekly data of all variables will be utilized during the 2016-2018 period. This study will conduct an empirical analysis by using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) test model. The result found that only in the short term, EUR/USD affects the Ethereum prices, while the price of gold do not show any effect on Ethereum prices. Moreover, Bitcoin and 2 alt-coins (Litecoin, and Monero) affect significantly the Ethereum prices. Nevertheless, Ripple and Stellar do not show significant effect on Ethereum prices. © 2020 IEEE.","Alt-coin; Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; Ethereum; Exchange rate; Gold prices","Bitcoin; Ethereum; Gold; Information management; Investments; Auto-regressive; Empirical analysis; Exchange rates; Indonesia; Potential growth; Short term; Test Modeling; Time-series data; Costs",,,,,,"Corbet, S., Meegan, A., Larkin, C., Lucey, B., Yarovayac, L., Exploring the dynamic relationships between cryptocurrencies and other financial assets (2018) Econ.

However, how long the m-payment provider will survive to subsidize its promotional costs. Therefore, this study examines factors that affect the use of m-payment without looking at economic benefits but focus on customer behavior. The model in this study involved two individual differences and four m-payment features and equipped with two TAM variables that explain the behavior in adopting the technology. Then, empirical examination is conducted, starts with data collection using a survey from m-payment users. Afterwards, data is analyzed utilizing structural equation models (SEM) method. The result indicates that perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived of usefulness (PU) are the most powerful factors that influence the intention to use m-payment. Interestingly, among m-payment characteristics, only compatibility and convenience affect the PEOU while mobility and reachability have no effect on either PEOU or PU. This result also can be an insight for m-payment providers to implement their application development strategies based on their customer behavior. © 2019 IEEE.","individual differences; m-payment; m-payment characteristics; structural equation models","Economic and social effects; Information management; Application development; Economic benefits; Empirical examination; Individual Differences; M payments; Payment instrument; Perceived ease of use; Structural equation models; Electronic money",,,,,,"Au, Y.A., Kauffman, R.J., The economics of mobile payments: Understanding stakeholder issues for an emerging financial technology application (2008) Electron.

The results indicated that not all participants agreed that GAS is helping them in producing a transparent and accountable financial report. © 2017 IEEE.","Agency theory; GAS; IDX; Internal auditor; TAM","Gallium; Information systems; Agency theory; Face to face; Financial reports; Internal auditor; Public company; Qualitative approach; Semi structured interviews; Technology acceptance model; Metadata",,,,,,"Rezaee, Z., (2008) Corporate Governance and Ethics, , Wiley; Braun, R.L., Davis, H.E., Computer-assisted audit tools and techniques: Analysis and perspectives (2003) Managerial Auditing Journal, 18, p. 725; Debreceny, R., Lee, S.-L., Neo, W., Toh, J.S., Employing generalized audit software in the financial services sector: Challenges and opportunities (2005) Managerial Auditing Journal, 20, p. 605; Ismail, N.A., Abidin, A.Z., Perception towards the importance and knowledge of information technology among auditors in Malaysia (2009) Journal of Accounting and Taxation, 1, pp. 061-069; Mahzan, N., Lymer, A., Examining the adoption of computerassisted audit tools and techniques: Cases of generalized audit software use by internal auditors (2014) Managerial Auditing Journal, 29, pp. 327-349; Ahmi, A., Kent, S., The utilisation of generalized audit software (GAS) by external auditors (2013) Managerial Auditing Journal, 28, pp. 88-113; Widuri, R., O'Connell, B., Yapa, P.W.S., Adopting generalized audit software: An Indonesian perspective (2016) Managerial Auditing Journal, 31, pp. 821-847; Kim, H.-J., Mannino, M., Nieschwietz, R.J., Information technology acceptance in the internal audit profession: Impact of technology features and complexity (2009) International Journal of Accounting Information Systems, 10, pp. 214-228; Sikka, P., Financial crisis and the silence of the auditors (2009) Accounting, Organizations and Society, 34, pp. 868-873; Sirois, L.-P., Simunic, D.A., (2010) Auditor Size and Audit Quality Revisited: The Importance of Audit Technology, , September 16, 2011; Janvrin, D., Bierstaker, J., Lowe, D.J., An examination of audit information technology use and perceived importance (2008) Accounting Horizons, 22, pp. 1-21; Manson, S., McCartney, S., Sherer, M., Wallace, W.A., Audit automation in the UK and the us: A comparative study (1998) International Journal of Auditing, 2, pp. 233-246; Dowling, Appropriate audit support system use: The influence of auditor, audit team, and firm factors (2009) The Accounting Review, 84, p. 771; Curtis, M.B., Payne, E.A., An examination of contextual factors and individual characteristics affecting technology implementation decisions in auditing (2008) International Journal of Accounting Information Systems, 9, pp. 104-121; Razi, M.A., Madani, H.H., An analysis of attributes that impact adoption of audit software: An empirical study in Saudi Arabia (2013) International Journal of Accounting and Information Management, 21, pp. 170-188; Blair, M.M., Ownership and control: Rethinking corporate governance for the twenty-first century (2004) Theories of Corporate Governance: The Philosophical Foundations of Corporate Governance, pp. 174-188. , T.

Using Micro Enterprises (MEs) in traditional markets around Jakarta - Indonesia as the object of the research, approximately 20% MEs were found to have no banking facilities. Furthermore, instead of using credit facility, around 78% MEs still utilise their own capital to facilitate their businesses. The paper also examines the personal characteristics that can explain financial inclusion. Results revealed that only gender and education could explain financial inclusion. Morever, the findings also revealed that MEs generally demand for banking facility. Nevertheless, there are several barriers that hamper them from financially included. In particular, Self Exclusion and Marketing Exclusion are the most barriers that MEs face in accessing financial services.","Financial Exclusion; Financial Inclusion; Micro Enterprises",,,,,,,"Amaeshi, K.M., (2006) Financial Exclusion, Financial Institutions and Corporate Social Responsibility: A Developing Country Perspective, , Working Paper, Social Science Research Network (SSRN), Rochester, NY; Cnaan, R.A., Moodithaya, M.S., Handy, F., Financial inclusion: Lessons from rural south India (2012) Journal Social Policy, 41 (1), pp. 183-205; Fuller, D., Mellor, M., Banking for the poor: Addressing the needs of financially excluded Communities in Newcastle Upon Tyne (2008) Urban Studies, 45, pp. 1505-1524; Hannig, A., Jansen, S., Financial inclusion and financial stability: Current policy issues (2011) ADBI Working Paper Series, (259); Khaki, A.R., Sangmi, M.D., Financial inclusion in Jammu &kashmir: A study on bankers Initiatives (2012) Journal of Arts, Science &commerce, III, 4 (2), pp. 115-123; Leyshon, A., Signoretta, P., French, S., (2006) The Changing Geography of British Bank and Building Society Branch Networks 1995-2003, , http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/geography/general/news-events/; Mitton, L., (2008) Financial Inclusion in the UK: Review of Policy and Practice, , Bristol: Joseph Rowntree Foundation; (2009) Financial Inclusion: An Overview, , NABARD.

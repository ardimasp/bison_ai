Cloud computing, as one of the continuously growing IT technology, is also not an anomaly. It is perceived that flexibility and scalability offered by cloud services will easily address business demands. However, the suitability of cloud services to certain use cases requires a holistic cloud strategy. This motivates this literature research to propose a framework to facilitate a successful implementation of cloud solutions and to indicate which potential areas are for future research. There are two main perspectives served as the basis of this framework, i.e. technical perspective on Enterprise Architecture (EA) using TOGAF, and business perspective for cloud investment decision making. To develop this framework, we followed a design science approach and conducted a literature review on respective theories. © 2020 IEEE.","Business perspective; Cloud adoption; Enterprise architecture; TOGAF","Computation theory; Information management; Investments; Web services; Business demands; Business perspective; Development method; Enterprise Architecture; Information technology implementations; Investment decision making; Literature researches; Literature reviews; Decision making",,,,,"Delivering on high cloud expectations (2012) Forrester Research, , Forrester Research; Karkošková Dan, S., Feuerlicht, G., Cloud computing governance reference model for cloud service consumers (2017) Proceedings of the 29th International Business Information Management Association Conference-Education Excellence and Innovation Management through Vision 2020: From Regional Development Sustainability to Global Economic Growth; Ovidiu Dan, N., Bernus, P., Business cloudification-an enterprise architecture perspective (2017) ICEIS, (3), pp. 353-360; Rimal, B.P., Jukan, A., Katsaros, D., Goeleven, Y., Architectural requirements for cloud computing systems: An enterprise cloud approach (2011) Journal of Grid Computing, pp. 3-26; Peffers, K., Tuunanen, T., Rothenberger, M., Chatterjee, S., A design science research methodology for information systems research (2007) Journal of Management Information Systems, pp. 45-77; Garrison, G., Sanghyun, K., Wakefield, R., Success factors for deploying cloud computing (2012) Communications of the ACM, 55 (9), pp. 62-68; Nisaa'Andi, S.T., Amalia, N.A., Lubis, M., It roadmap to improve business strategy using togaf adm: A case study of government-owned electricity company (2019) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1361; Mahmood, Z., Cloud computing for enterprise architectures: Concepts, principles and approaches (2011) Cloud Computing for Enterprise Architectures, pp. 3-19. , Springer; Iacob, M.E., Jonkers, H., Quartel, D., Van Den Berg Franken, H.H., (2012) Delivering Enterprise Architecture with TOGAF® and ARCHIMATE®, , Open Group; Moshiri Dan, S., Hill, R., Enterprise architecture fundamentals (2011) Cloud Computing for Enterprise Architectures, pp. 21-41. , Springer; Iacob, M.E., Meertens, L., Jonkers, H., Quartel, D., Nieuwenhuis, L., Van Sinderen, M., From enterprise architecture to business models and back (2014) Software & Systems Modeling, 13 (3), pp. 1059-1083; Leist Dan, S., Zellner, G., Evaluation of current architecture frameworks (2006) Proceedings of the 2006 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, pp. 1546-1553; Buckl, Using enterprise architecture management patterns to complement togaf (2009) Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference 2009, pp. 34-41; Zardari, S., (2016) Cloud Adoption: A Goal-oriented Requirements Engineering Approach, , University of Birmingham; Khajeh-Hosseini, A., Greenwood, D., Smith, J., Sommerville, I., The cloud adoption toolkit: Supporting cloud adoption decisions in the enterprise (2012) Software: Practice and Experience, 42 (4), pp. 447-465; Isom Dan, P., Holley, K., (2012) Is Your Company Ready for Cloud: Choosing the Best Cloud Adoption Strategy for Your Business, , Pearson Publication; Bhattacherjee, A., Social science research: Principles, methods, and practices (2012) Global Text Project; Leist Dan, S., Gregor, Z., Evaluation of current architecture frameworks (2006) Proceedings of the 2006 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, pp. 1546-1553; Buckle, S., Ernst, A., Matthes, F., Ramacher, R., Schweda, C., Using enterprise architecture management patterns to complement togaf (2009) 2009 IEEE International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference, pp. 34-41; Peppard, J., Ward, J., Daniel, E., Managing the realization of business benefits from it investments (2008) MIS Quarterly Executive, 6 (1); Maul, J.P., (2011) Developing A Business Case: Expert Solutions to Everyday Challenges, , Harvard Business Review Press; Al-Hujran, O., Al-Lozi, E., Maqableh, M., Challenges of cloud computing adoption from the toe framework perspective (2018) International Journal of E-Business Research (IJEBR), 14 (3), pp. 77-94; (2019) Practical Guide to Cloud Service Ver 3. 0, , Object Management Group-Cloud Working Group Object Management Group-Cloud Working Group; Meertens, L., Relating business modelling and enterprise architecture (2013) Enschede: Proefschriftmaken.

The renewal of this research is to add access to subject matter features and discussion forum features. These features do not yet exist in the chatbot application system in other studies. Authentication on the chatbot is needed to find out who the user is accessing the chatbot for the material, discussion forum, and work on the problem training and National Examination exercises. E-learning innovation from chatbots is integrated with the LINE and CMS messaging mobile application that contains subject matter, exam practice, discussion forums, and evaluation of student evaluations. This system supports students who have limited time to attend traditional face-to-face classes and have limited access to laptops. The results of this study prove that Chatbot on smartphones can maximize student learning functions, increase student interest and achievement (value). © 2019 IEEE","Chatbot; Content Management System; LINE","C (programming language); Knowledge engineering; Mobile computing; Students; Application systems; Chatbot; Content management system; Learning support systems; LINE; Mobile applications; Research objectives; Student evaluation; Learning systems",,,,,"Noesgaard, S.S., Ørngreen, R., The effectiveness of e-learning: An explorative and integrative review of the definitions, methodologies and factors that promote e-learning effectiveness (2015) Electronic Journal of E-Learning, 13 (4), pp. 278-290; Roos, S., (2018) Chatbots in Education: A Passing Trend or a Valuable Pedagogical Tool?; Pereira, J., Leveraging chatbots to improve self-guided learning through conversational quizzes (2016) Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality, pp. 911-918. , November.

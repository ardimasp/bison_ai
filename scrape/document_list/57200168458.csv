Although Indonesia has succeeded in reducing malnutrition and stunting rates over the past few years, these two issues must still be considered as something serious in order to prevent the increasing number of malnutrition and stunting rates in the future. This study aims to analyze the suitable logistic regression methods and growth charts to reduce the number of children with malnutrition and stunting status. Based on the analysis of previous studies and theories, researchers have found that multinomial logistic regression is the most suitable method to measure children nutritional and stunting status because it can provide more specific results, such as malnutrition, undernutrition, normal nutrition and obese. WHO growth charts - weight-for-age chart that already exists in Kartu Menuju Sehat (KMS) - is suitable to be applied in monitoring child's nutritional status because Indonesia's Anthropometric Standards Assessing Nutritional Status of Children are developed based on WHO Standards. To be able to perform Indonesian children stunting status measurement, WHO length-for-age or height-for-age growth chart needs to be applied. © 2017 The Authors.

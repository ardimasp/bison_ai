The findings show: 1) the position of leaders as the most important component of communication 2) GPG could be disseminated to members if the organisation's culture has the following features: Process Oriented, Professional Approach, Open situation, Formal Relations, and Fix Regulation. 3) Excellent communication occurs when there is trust in sources and receiver to communicate, and create value for both sides. This study concludes that excellent organisation communication which supports GPG is able to maintain continuity of communication in an organisation. Excellent communication for GPG is communication that serves the community's interests.","Communication; Excellent; Good Public Governance; Organisation Culture",,,,,,"Arguden, Y., (2010) A Corporate Governance Model: Building Responsible Boards and Sustainable Businesses.

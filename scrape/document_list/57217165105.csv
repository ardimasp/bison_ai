Data helps organization to get valuable insights, allows itself to be innovative and provides ability to develop its unique competitive advantage. Despite of its strategic role, many organizations neglect the necessity to manage their data properly, mainly due to its broad scope, and complexities. The strategic value of data could not be obtained only by capturing and storing it. Instead, data management initiative is required to develop, execute and supervise plans, policies, programs and processes to deliver, control, protect and enhance the data. The entire data lifecycle process needs to be properly planned and managed in order to ensure data integrity, data quality, data security, and data privacy. This study aims to brief the key aspects of data management framework for early adopters based on Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on selected 25 relevant papers. As the conclusion, the study has identified multiple data management frameworks that are available to provide sufficient guide for data management implementation. Organization could selectively customize the framework implementation based on their specific needs and readiness. Organization also can choose to implement data management framework in stages/incremental manner. © 2019 ICIC International.

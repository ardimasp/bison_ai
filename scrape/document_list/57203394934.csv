Chinese overseas have strong emotional ties with the State of China as their country of origin. In Indonesia, Chinese overseas are called Tionghoa ethnic. They have been living in Indonesia for many generations and believed that they came to Indonesia long before the century. This research was to examine Chinese ethnic perspectives on Confucius values of their leadership in West Java Chinese organization (Fuqing association). This research was conducted at Fuqing association in West Java covering four cities namely Bandung, Bogor, Cianjur, and Sukabumi. The questionnaire was distributed to 121 active members of the Fuqing association. The questionnaire consisted of 31 questions that represent Confucius values. This study used confirmatory factor analysis to test the research model using Smart Partial Least Square version 3.0 (Smart PLS 3.0). The results of this research showed that Confucius values were still practised in Chinese leadership in West Java. Generally, Confucius values in Chinese ethnic leadership are still similar to confusion leadership variables, but the significant variable in Chinese leadership is different. In West Java, the important variables are moral character and lifelong learning. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Chinese ethnic perspective; Chinese leadership; Confucius values; Leadership",,,,,,"Praise the Lord for everything.

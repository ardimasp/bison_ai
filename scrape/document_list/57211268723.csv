Most of the times, the development of an information systems application judged only from the technical side, while there are actually many more non-technical factors like the human resources readiness, organizational support, and so on that could affects the level of user's acceptance towards an information systems application. Therefore, this research will uncover the gaps in Transportation Management System (TRM), a car-rental application of XYZ Transportation Solution's at PT. XYZ, by using Fit Gap Analysis for further improvement in the future. Furthermore, this research will also uncover the factors that affect the degree of user acceptance towards that system by using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) methodology. The result of this research show there are several gaps on the TRM. The factors of Perceived Ease of Use significantly influenced the factor intention to use. © 2019 IEEE.","fit gap analysis; information systems application; technology acceptance model (TAM); transportation management system.","Enterprise resource planning; Information systems; Information use; Management information systems; Transportation personnel; Case study approach; Gap analysis; Information systems application; Non-technical factors; Organizational support; Perceived ease of use; Technology acceptance model; Transportation management systems; Information management",,,,,"(2012) University of Waterloo-IT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, , https://uwaterloo.ca/it-portfolio-management/sites/ca.it-portfoliomanagement/files/uploads/files/template-fitgap-document-2013-11-08.docx, Waterloo.

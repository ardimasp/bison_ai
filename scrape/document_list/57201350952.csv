The study uses a descriptive approach by reviewing and analyzing some of relevant literature as the sources. It also reviews and examines the port development theoretical concepts and models giving attention to the international hub port models resulted from the previous studies. The international hub port aspects assessed to be further applied and compared to the actual situation of the Port of Belawan. This process draws the conclusion on which concept and model the port classified, followed by some recommendations concerning the necessary actions to be taken. The results show that: (1) The port planning regulated in port master plan is the guideline and foundation to implement the port development; (2) Spatial and zoning plan regulations are very important in the preparation, planning, and implementation of port development; (3) It has not provided the necessary facilities and criteria of the global hub port model has not been met completely. The port is strategic to be completely developed as the regional hub port to compete with the major ports of neighboring countries. Eventually, this study requires further analysis to examine the economic feasibility of the Port of Belawan in more comprehensive way functioning as an international hub port along with the ongoing development of Kuala Tanjung Port to achieve its ultimate objectives, among other things, the port effectiveness, efficiency, and competitiveness. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","international hub port;

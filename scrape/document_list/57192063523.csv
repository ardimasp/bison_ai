The method of research is explanatory research which aims to analyze the relationship between one variable stage above. The Data collection techniques used in this study is a questionnaire using semantic differential scale and explained the research design, data retrieval, data processing and data analysis. Data analysis used in analyzing factors of technological acceptance model (TAM) in the application of Knowledge Management in small medium enterprises in creative economy is descriptive statistics to consider a frequency distribution the size and spread of data on characteristics of the sample (respondents) and indicator variable endogenous and provide explanation of its mean value, standard deviations, variant, maximum, range, skewness and kurtosis.

Based on Canonical analysis results, the dominant influence on the financial performance of intellectual capital rather than vice versa. Granger causality analysis results indicate that all the variables of intellectual capital and financial performance can be mutually influential. Not all variables have a significant influence one with another. The variables that have significant influence among one another is HCE to ROA, ROE to SCE, and ROA to ROE (not vice versa).

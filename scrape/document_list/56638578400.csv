Although a number of organization prefer to use outsourcing and leasing services to manage the asset, but some organization prefer to buy their own and manage their assets. Currently maintaining asset is not an easy task, organization need to be considered about how to use the asset effectively. Information System can help the organization to manage assets, maintenance and repair of assets, calculate asset depreciation, and asset reallocation among divisions in organization. Information System as a media becomes very important to help the management of assets to be more coordinated. Laboratory ABC as part of the computer laboratory at university in Jakarta, is currently had many problems about asset management because there are a lot of devices to be maintained. The assets in computer laboratory are consists of hardware, software, and many other supporting devices. Based on these problems, the research is perform to analysis the process in asset management as well as to formulate and implement a framework of information system that suitable with the management of existing assets in laboratory ABC, so all data can be managed with the system. The method for this research is based on object-oriented analysis and design. The result of this research is an asset management system to support operational laboratory ABC process. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT & LLS.

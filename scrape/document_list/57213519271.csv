The Academic information system serving students carry out lectures and gain value in the form of cards in each semester of study results. In order to rebuilding this system the current system will be measured with Use Case Point (UCP) in order to help management when extend the current Academic Information System. UCP will help the management when making their decisions regarding with the development of system in term of time, people and money. Measurement software using the UCP in Academic Information Systems of Satya Negara Indonesia university has score Use Case Point (UCP) = 86.864 and categorized as small software size project which is smaller than 99. © 2017 IEEE.","Software measurement; software size; Use case point","Artificial intelligence; Information systems; Information use; Software engineering; Academic activities; Gain values; Measurement software; Software Measurement; Software size; Study case; Teaching-learning process; Use case points; Information management",,,,,"Karner, G., Resource estimation for objectory projects (1993) Objective System SF AB; Clemmons, R.K., Project estimation with use case point (2006) Diversified Technical Services Inc; Warnars, H.L.H.S., Randriatoamanana, R., Datawarehouser: A Data Warehouse artist who have ability to understand data warehouse schema pictures (2016) IEEE TENCON 2016 (Technologies for Smart Nation), pp. 2207-2210. , http://site.tencon2016.focalevents.sg, 22-25 Nov 2016, Singapore; Warnars, H.L.H.S., Perbandingan penggunaan Database OLTP (Online Transactional Processing) dan Data Warehouse (2014) Creative Communication and Innovative Technology (CCIT Journal, 8 (1), pp. 83-100. , September; Warnars, H.L.H.S., Mining patterns with attribute oriented induction (2015) The International Conference on Database, Data Warehouse, Data Mining and Big Data (DDDMBD2015), Tangerang, Indonesia, pp. 11-21. , 10-12 September; Warnars, H.L.H.S., Wijaya, M.I., Tjung, H.B., Xaverius, D.F., Hauten Sasmoko, D.V., Easy understanding of Attribute Oriented Induction (AOI) characteristic rule algorithm (2016) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research (IJAER, 11 (8), pp. 5369-5375. , http://www.ripublication.com/ijaer16/ijaerv11n803.pdf, Source; Warnars, H.L.H.S., Using attribute oriented induction high level emerging pattern (aoi-hep) to mine frequent patterns (2016) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE), 6 (6). , http://www.iaesjournal.com/online/index.php/IJECE/article/view/10579; Warnars, H.L.H.S., Mining frequent and similar patterns with attribute oriented induction high level emerging pattern (aoi-hep) data mining technique (2014) International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Computational and Applied Sciences (IJETCAS, 3 (11), pp. 266-276. , http://iasir.net/IJETCASpapers/IJETCAS15-247.pdf, ISSN: 2279-0055.

Customers’ decision on online purchase still is influenced by how confident they are in making purchase decision. Influencer endorsement is a hot concept in marketing; however, scholars argue there is only little evident on how influencer endorsement can improve performance. On the other hand, customer reviews are considered as effective in influencing customers’ decision. Where customers buy is also an interesting topic. Studies on B2C e-marketplace are still limited. This study aims to see young customers’ perception about influencer endorsement, customer review and e-tailing channel. A qualitative study was conducted to 55 respondents from Jakarta and Bogor. To further understand their opinions, interview was conducted to 10 of respondents. The finding of the study are young customers believe in customer review rather than influencer endorsement. They prefer to shop in e-marketplace compared to company owned website. This study contributes to the literature of customer review, influencer marketing and e-marketplace. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The development of facial recognition systems has also developed and has been implemented for home door locking systems and is an option that is quite simple and easy to use and is quite accurate in recognizing the face of homeowners. The development of the CNN method in facial recognition has become one of the face recognition systems that are easy to implement and have good accuracy in recognizing faces and has been used in object recognition systems and others. In this study, using the CNN Alexnet facial recognition system which is implemented in a door locking system, data collection is done by collecting 1048 facial data on the face of the homeowner using a system which is then used to train machine learning where the results are quite accurate where the accuracy is the result is 97.5% which is quite good compared to some other studies. The conclusion is the CNN Alexnet method can perform facial recognition which is quite accurate which can be implemented on the IoT device, namely, the Raspberry Pi. © 2020.

This study shows some evidences that gamification outperform non-gamification teaching method in related to learning concentration, skills, feedback, and immersion. However, gamification method has some drawbacks in related to compliance of quiz difficulty with the level/learning progress, clarity of overall learning goal, and clarity of goal at each level. These strength and drawbacks of gamification design are expected to give valuable information for teachers in delivering Mandarin as second language. © 2016 IEEE.","gamification; m-learning; Mandarin as second language","E-learning; Students; Teaching; College students; Gamification; Learning goals; M-Learning; Second language; Teaching methods; Education",,,,,"Dixon, L.Q., Zhao, J., Shin, J.-Y., Wu, S., Su, J.-H., Burgess-Brigham, R., Gezer, M.U., Snow, C., What we know about second language acquisition: A synthesis from four perspectives (2012) Review of Educational Research, 82, pp. 5-60; Wang, D., Moloney, R., Li, Z., Towards internationalising the curriculum: A Case study of Chinese language teacher education programs in China and Australia (2013) Australian Journal of Teacher Education, 38 (9), pp. 116-135; Weiler, L., (2016) 7 Best Foreign Languages to Learn in 2016, , http://www.cheatsheet.com/culture/foreign-languages-to-learnin-2016.html/?a=viewall; Chen, N.F., Wee, D., Tong, R., Ma, B., Li, H., Large-Scale Characterization of Non-Native Mandarin Chinese Spoken by Speakers of European Origin: Analysis on iCALL (2016) Speech Communication; Lewis, M.P., Simons, G.F., (2015) Ethnologue: Languages of the World, , http://www.ethnologue.com, Eighteenth edition.

The model describes the trade-off between production and maintenance costs as the production run length increases on two machines. The objective function of the model is to minimize the total cost consisting of in process and completed part inventory costs, setup costs, preventive & corrective maintenance costs and rework costs on two machines. The step-wise optimization algorithm is developed to solve a mixed integer quadratic programming. Comparison with the practice and the model sensitivity analysis are demonstrated to clarify how the algorithm works. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Batch production; Flow shop; Machine maintenance; Two machines",,,,,,"Ben-Daya, M., Noman, S.A., Lot sizing, preventive maintenance, and warranty decisions for imperfect production systems (2006) Journal of Quality in Maintenance Engineering, 12 (1), pp. 68-80; Berrichi, A., Amodeo, L., Yalaoui, F., Châtelet, E., Mezghiche, M., Bi-objective optimization algorithms for joint production and maintenance scheduling: Application to the parallel machine problem (2009) Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 20 (4), p. 389; Chelbi, A., Rezg, N., Radhoui, M., Simultaneous determination of production lot size and preventive maintenance schedule for unreliable production system (2008) Journal of Quality in Maintenance Engineering, 14 (2), pp. 161-176; Chiu, Y., Lin, H., Wu, M., Chiu, S., Alternative fabrication scheme to study effects of rework of nonconforming products and delayed differentiation on a multiproduct supply-chain system (2018) International Journal of Industrial Engineering Computations, 9 (2), pp. 235-248; El-Ferik, S., Ben-Daya, M., Integrated production maintenance model under imperfect age-based maintenance policy and non-negligible maintenance times (2010) Asia-Pacific Journal of Operational Research, 27 (4), pp. 539-558; Fitouhi, M.C., Nourelfath, M., Integrating noncyclical preventive maintenance scheduling and production planning for a single machine (2012) International Journal of Production Economics, 136 (2), pp. 344-351; Halim, A.H., Ohta, H., Batch-scheduling problems to minimize inventory cost in the shop with both receiving and delivery just-in-times (1994) International Journal of Production Economics, 33 (1-3), pp. 185-194; Lee, H.L., Rosenblatt, M.J., Simultaneous determination of production cycle and inspection schedules in a production system (1987) Management Science, 33 (9), pp. 1125-1136; Lin, L., Hou, K., EMQ model with maintenance actions for deteriorating production system (2005) International Journal of Information and Management Sciences, 16 (1), p. 53; Mo, S., Zeng, J., Xu, W., A new warranty policy based on a buyer’s preventive maintenance investment (2017) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 111, pp. 433-444; Moradi, E., Ghomi, S.F., Zandieh, M., Bi-objective optimization research on integrated fixed time interval preventive maintenance and production for scheduling flexible job-shop problem (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 38 (6), pp. 7169-7178; Murthy, D.N.P., Jiang, R., (2008) Maintenance: Decision Models for Management, 1, pp. 1-305. , Science Press; Prasetyaningsih, E., Suprayogi, S., Samadhi, T.A., Halim, A.H., Production and Delivery Batch Scheduling with Multiple Due Dates to Minimize Total Cost (2017) Journal of Engineering and Technological Sciences, 49 (1), pp. 16-36; Suliman, S.M., Jawad, S.H., Optimization of preventive maintenance schedule and production lot size (2012) International Journal of Production Economics, 137 (1), pp. 19-28; Tseng, S.T., Optimal preventive maintenance policy for deteriorating production systems (1996) IIE Transactions, 28 (8), pp. 687-694; Wang, C.H., Sheu, S.H., Simultaneous determination of the optimal production–inventory and product inspection policies for a deteriorating production system (2001) Computers & Operations Research, 28 (11), pp. 1093-1110; Winston, W.L., Goldberg, J.B., (2004) Operations Research: Applications and Algorithms, 3. , Belmont: Thomson Brooks/Cole; Yusriski, R., Sukoyo, S., Samadhi, T.M.A.A., Halim, A., Integer batch scheduling problems for a single-machine with simultaneous effect of learning and forgetting to minimize total actual flow time (2015) International Journal of Industrial Engineering Computations, 6 (3), pp. 365-378; Zahedi, Z., Samadhi, T., Suprayogi, S., Halim, A., Integrated batch production and maintenance scheduling for multiple items processed on a deteriorating machine to minimize total production and maintenance costs with due date constraint (2016) International Journal of Industrial Engineering Computations, 7 (2), pp. 229-244","Zahedi, Z.; Department of Mathematics, Syahdan Street 9, Indonesia; email: zahedizahedi@binus.ac.id",,,"Growing Science",,,,,19232926,,,,"English","Int.

This method includes three main concepts, the concepts of fuzzy, time series and Markov chain. Fuzzy concepts are useful to classify variables, time series concept to observe the JCI movement during a particular period and Markov chain concept is used in process prediction of JCI values using the transition probability matrix. To assist the analysis of predictions, we design a web-based application that aims to predict by analyzing a JCI data set closing price on a certain period, so that the process can be more efficient, thorough and practical. We compare the accuracy of FTMC and prediction powered from Song and Chissom. The resulting value is quite accurate and can assist users in making decisions relating to the exercise of economic activity. © 2015 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.","Fuzzy time series model; JCI; Markov chain; Web",,,,,,"Arumugam, P., Anithakumari, V., Fuzzy time series method for forecasting Taiwan export data (2013) Inter.

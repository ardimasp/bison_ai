After 8 years are applied, the author felt the need to do an evaluation of the information systems to identify and measure the success rate of the application/ implementation of the HIS Kasih Group. This study aims to evaluate the system information by using HOT FIT Model. HOT FIT Model has four perspectives namely information systems Human (Human), Organization, Technology and the benefits provided. With all four perspectives is expected to yield an appropriate evaluation to measure the success and influence of HIS implementation. This study will be tested to 213 HIS users by using questionnaires and interviews. The data collection technique is used to assess the effect of each perspective HOT FIT Model. Data will be analyzed quantitatively by using multiple regression. The results showed that 1) the impact on the use of User Satisfaction System, 2) use of the system positively affects user satisfaction. 3) Quality of information is User Satisfaction of positive influence. 4) Quality of Service is positive effect on User Satisfaction. 5) Quality Systems positive effect on Organizational Structure. 6) Quality of Service positive effect on Organizational Structure. 7) Environment Organization positive effect on Organizational Structure. © 2017 IEEE.","Evaluation; HIS; HOT FIT Model; Information Systems","Hospitals; Information management; Information systems; Quality of service; Surveys; Evaluation; Hospital information systems; Hot fits; Multiple regressions; Organizational structures; Quality of information; System information; User satisfaction; Information use",,,,,"Metev, S.M., Veiko, V.P., (1998) Laser Assisted Microtechnology, , 2nd ed., R.

Cloud computing provides ample benefits to companies such as mobility, ease of access, and enable collaboration. Nevertheless, the impact of cloud computing on the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) is not well established. This research aims to classify the factors affecting the acceptance of cloud computing in Indonesian MSMEs. A total of 135 participants participated in this analysis. The TOE Structure is used in this analysis. Methods of data collection using Google form. The details have been analysed with SPSS and SmartPLS. The findings demonstrated that top management encouragement and relative advantages have a positive impact on the adoption of cloud computing in MSMEs in Indonesia. In order to increase the adoption of cloud-based computing in Indonesia, cloud-based businesses need to concentrate on these two reasons so that MSMEs in Indonesia can embrace more cloud computing. Furthermore, the improvement of cloud computing adoption should come from government policy and incentives. Theoretically, this research helps to establish the TOE framework by providing empirical evidence. This research also explains that the TOE framework can help companies to understand critical domains that impact their businesses and which domain companies should focus. © 2020, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

A theoretical model was developed based on the two complementary models, the technology acceptance model (TAM) and technology-organisation-environment (TOE). An e-survey was conducted among firms that had adopted cloud-computing technology in Indonesia creative industries. This study provides sufficient statistical evidence to infer that perceived usefulness, compatibility, security and privacy, management support and competitive pressure were related to the adoption of cloud computing. Cloud vendors must consider incorporating networks that offer more user friendly and affordable solutions to the market. One factor related user friendliness is that the network must be convenient to use without any issues related to performance. Solutions tied to the cloud should be cost effective for small and medium-sized businesses.

The data was analysed based on 100 valid responses collected from external auditors. The results show that the variables of performance expectancy, effort expectancy and facilitating conditions directly influence the behavioural intention of external auditors to use GAS. Behavioural intention influences the use behaviour while social influence does not affect the behavioural intention. This study concludes that audit firms can focus on the benefits of audit software and the availability of features that fit the tasks during the audit process such as test of control and substantive testing. In addition audit firms can choose audit software that has clear instructions and is easy to learn. Further, audit firms can also improve supporting facilities for the use of audit software such as conducting training on the use of audit software, and investing in additional organizational and technical infrastructures. © 2019, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Anthropocentric religious communication; BAZNAS empowering; Marginal communities",,,,,,,"Ahmi, A., Kent, S., The utilisation of generalized audit software (GAS) by external auditors (2013) Managerial Auditing Journal, 28 (2), pp. 88-113; Bierstaker, J., Janvrin, D., Lowe, D.J., What factors influence auditors' use of computer-assisted audit techniques?

Using convenience sampling method, a total of 219 postgraduate students from 4 Malaysian technical universities participated in the study. Structured equation modelling was used to analyse the data and findings indicate that CSS support have a significant positive relationship with 'perceived usefulness', and 'cloud storage self-efficacy' have significant positive relationship on the 'perceived ease of use'. Both 'perceived usefulness' and 'perceived ease of use' have a significant relationship on students' intention to use CSS. The findings of this study can help the service providers to develop successful strategic plans for usage of CSS.

Three instrumentals consisting of ABMS checklist, ABMS Matrix, and ABMS Dashboard were developed based on international references. ABMS has eight dimensions which are (1)Tone of the top, (2)risk assessment, (3)policies and procedures, (4)training and communication, (5)monitoring and auditing, (6)investigation and reports, (7)enforcement and sanction and (8)review and update. Data was collected in September 2017 from 31 middle and top management level of one organization as a preliminary study. The developed checklist was first validated by panel experts in the subject matter. A briefing session was then made to the respondents and they were then requested to answer the final checklist online. Data collected was then analyzed using descriptive statistics to gauge the perception of respondents towards the extent of implementation of ABMS in an organization. The organization was found to score 63.9%.

The approach used to conduct risk management of information technology is a method of Facilitated Risk Analysis Process (FRAP). The results are the discovery of the risks of using information technology.

The research methodology used involves library research, documentation studies and interviews, collected data were analyzed using the NIST method. Results from this study indicate there are 13 types of risks that might occur, one of them at high risk (Malicious code) and there are two risks with a medium risk level (Information theft, server hangs). The conclusion was that risk control has been applied quite good but can still be improved controls to ensure company objectives achieved. Some of the controls that have been implemented quite well but still there are some weaknesses in it, among others: the password is not changed periodically, there is no documentation about the system, the right of access to the IT division is too free and antivirus programs inadequate. © 2010 IEEE.","Information technology; Measurement; NIST; Risk","Anti-virus programs; Company objectives; Information technology risks; Information thefts; Library research; Malicious codes; NIST; NIST method; Research methodologies; Risk controls; Risk levels; Information technology; Research; Telecommunication; Risk assessment",,,,,,"(2010) Information Technology, , http://www.answers.com/topic/information-technology, Retrieve on May 2, 2010 from; Borade, G., (2009) Advantages of Information Technology, , http://www.buzzle.com/articles/advantages-of-information-technology.html, on May 2, 2010 from; (2004) Enterprise Risk Management, , www.coso.org/Publications/ERM/COSO_ERM_ExecutiveSummary.pdf, Retrieve on May 2, 2010 from; Djojosoedarso, S., (2005) Prinsip-prinsip Manajemen Risiko Asuransi, , Salemba Empat, Jakarta; Gever, J., (2010) IT Saves S3 Billion in VA Health System, , www.medpagetoday.com/PracticeManagement/InformationTechnology/19455, April 8, Retrieve on May 2, 2010 from; Klossner, K., (2009) Computer Information Technology - What It Is & Why It Is Important, , http://ezinearticles.com/?Computer-Information-Technology-What-it-is-and- Why-it-is-Important&id=2033670, Retrieve on May 2, 2010 from; Massing, E., (2009) Technical Support: Improving Performance and Reducing Costs with IT Risk Management, , http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=0&did=1924761451&SrchMode= 1&sid=4&Fmt=4&VInst=PROD&VType=PQD&RQT=309&VName= PQD&TS=1268427307&clientId=68814), Retrieve on May 2, 2010 from; McKendrick, J., (2009) Does IT Save More Energy Than It Consumes?

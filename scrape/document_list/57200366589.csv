This discourse focuses on the lens of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and Machine Learning of Artificial Intelligence (MLAI). To some extent several companies have embarked Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 within Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Through the wave of IoT Technology, Industries are adopting automated machinery. Predictive maintenance (PM) is indispensable not only toward the machines"" vitality and longevity purpose, but also toward the human error reduction. This paper elaborates its discourse of Industry 4.0 and Society through the lens of CBM and MLAI. The mentioned Machine Learning, in this paper, refers to research methodology, as methodological frameworks. Those frameworks comprise several phases, which are: 1. Equipment Analysis; 2. Data Evaluation; 3. Data Selection and Process; 4. Modeling; 5. Decision Support Model Evaluation. The MLAI techniques are based upon the identification of behaviour patterns. This identification comprises datasets that exclude mathematical models or prior historical knowledge. The discourse in this paper intertwines CBM process and MLAI through data cleaning and processing, features stratification and extraction, model stratification and validation. This paper elaborates two renowned maintenance approaches which are preventive and corrective maintenance. Discourse in this paper focuses on corrective action, known as predictive maintenance (PM), or condition based maintenance (CBM) within Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). CBM is chosen as the most desirable strategy, as it involves the intervention as the consequence of the machine breakdown. It also provides cost savings toward spare parts consumption, and optimizes production. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Promedika Sejahtera (PPS). PT Promedika Sejahtera is a company engaged in the laboratory equipment industry, that need its strategic touch on its Strategic Laboratory Equipment. Products sold by the company are Oxygen, Medical Equipment, Ultraviolet System, Activated Carbon Filter, Pempers, and Underpad. Products that exist in the company are not in their own production in the production from abroad. PT Promedika Sejahtera merely sell the laboratory equipment. Yet, the company has various types of consumers namely hospitals, hospital cooperatives, pharmacies, factories, and water equipment RO shops. In this paper, strategic laboratory equipment industry refers specifically to inventory within the supply chain management perspectives. This paper constitutes collaboration with other papers on Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), Re-Order Point (ROP), and Safety Stock (SS), that convolutes Forecasting, ABC Analysis, and Partial Least Square (PLS). Yet, this paper refers to its focus merely on Forecasting, Demand Pattern, Exponential Smoothing and EOQ. As part of conclusion, this paper conveys several highlighted remarks. Those remarks refer to ABC Analysis. The grouping of goods using ABC Analysis Method is divided into three groups: A with 80% priority, group B with 20% priority and group C with 10% priority. The number of goods in group A is 12 items, group B 18 item type and group C are 30 items of goods. Forecasting demand required by the Company for 2018 based on priority group A can be done using the Double Exponential Smoothing (Holt's) Method because the pattern pattern possessed from the previous year's sales data has no seasonal but has a random trend. The results of these calculations can be seen from the table of existing research results. Ultimately, Future research is deemed indispensable within novelty purpose for the industrial system sustainability within Strategic Laboratory Equipment Industry. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Inventory; Partial Least Square; Strategic Laboratory Equipment; Supply Chain; Sustainability","Activated carbon; Economic analysis; Forecasting; Hospitals; Industrial research; Information dissemination; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Activated carbon filters; Economic order quantity; Exponential smoothing; Forecasting demand; Industrial systems; Inventory; Laboratory equipments; Partial least square (PLS); Laboratories",,,,,"Kolassa, S., Retail analytics: Integrated forecasting and inventory management for perishable products in retailing (2015) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 66 (12), pp. 2103-2104; Nahmias, S., Olsen, T.L., (2015) Production and Operations Analysis; McLaughlin, D.B., Olson, J.R., (2008) Healthcare Operations Management, 4; Sunil, C., Peter, M., (2013) Supply Chain Management: Strategy, Planning, and Operation, 5; Sarjono, H., Kuncoro, E.A., Analisis Perbandingan Perhitungan Re-Order Point (2014) Binus Business Review, 5 (1), pp. 288-300; Shandyastini, N.M., Novianti, K.D.P., ANALISIS E-LEARNING STMIK STIKOM BALI MENGGUNAKAN TECHONOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL (2016) Jurnal TeknoIf, 4; Shukla, H.S., Tripathi, R.P., Sang, N., EOQ Model with Stock-Level Dependent Demand and Different Holding Cost Functions (2017) International Journal of Operations Research and Information Systems (IJORIS), 8 (4), pp. 59-75; Yanti, T.H., Farida, Y., Analisis ABC dalam Perencanaan Obat Antibiotik di Rumah Sakit Ortopedi Surakarta (2016) JPSCR: Journal of Pharmaceutical Science and Clinical Research, 1, pp. 51-57","Nugroho Soebandrija, K.E.; Industrial Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: knugroho@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

This study aims to determine the conception and behaviour of the population on the risk of Mount Merapi as a study to manage a sustainable disaster management system. This research uses an exploratory retrospective view approach, utilizes survey and questionnaire as its research instruments. The questionnaire consisted of four categories based on the literature study, which include the respondent profile, risk definition, risk perception, and risk action. The sampling technique used is a multi-stage stratified convenience sampling (n = 300, response rate = 91%). Its stratification is the disaster-prone areas (DPA) and the population gender. The results showed that most respondents perceived risk as a consequence, in contrast to the normative theory. Respondents in DPA III have a tendency of risk attitude as risk moderate, while respondents in DPA II have a risk-averse tendency. In relation to the respondent behaviour during eruption, it was found that DPA and gender differences showed different respondents' response in facing Mount Merapi eruption disaster in terms of the evacuation time, the action when hearing the warning sign, the evacuation route being followed, and the willingness to help others. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

It requires a sustainable system and a well-integrated management system. Any errors in the system on this phase will impact on significant increase of the victims number as well as material damage caused. Policies related to the location of aid posts are important decisions. The facts show that there are many failures in the process of providing assistance to the refugees due to lack of preparation and determination of facilities and aid post location. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the number and location of aid posts on Merapi eruption in 2010. This study uses an integration between Agent Based Modeling (ABM) and Geographic Information System (GIS) about evaluation of the number and location of the aid post using some scenarios. The ABM approach aims to describe the agents behaviour (refugees and volunteers) in the event of a disaster with their respective characteristics. While the spatial data, GIS useful to describe real condition of the Sleman regency road. Based on the simulation result, it shows alternative scenarios that combine DERU UGM post, Maguwoharjo Stadium, Tagana Post and Pakem Main Post has better result in handling and distributing aid to evacuation barrack compared to initial scenario. Alternative scenarios indicates the unmet demands are less than the initial scenario. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","agent based modeling; geographic information system; response phase; sustainable","Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Emergency services; Information systems; Location; Management information systems; Software agents; Agent-based model; Disaster management; Emergency response; Humanitarian relief; Integrated management systems; response phase; sustainable; Sustainable systems; Geographic information systems",,,,,"Balcik, B., Beamon, B.M., Krejci, C.C., Muramatsu, K.M., Ramirez, M., Coordination in Humanitarian Relief Chains: Practices, Challenges and Opportunities (2010) International Journal Production Economics, pp. 22-34; Verma, A., Gaukler, G.M., Pre-positioning disaster response facilities at safe locations: An evaluation of deterministic and stochastic modeling approaches (2015) Computers & Operations Research, 62, pp. 197-209; Horan, T.A., Marich, M., Time-critical information services: Analysis and workshop findings on technology, organizational, and policy dimensions to emergency response and related governmental services International Conference on Digital Government Research, , (San Diego, CA, 2006); Wassenhove, V.L.N., Blackett Memorial Lecture Humanitarian aid logistics: Supply chain management in high gear (2009) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 57, pp. 475-489; Crooks, A., Castle, C., Batty, M., Key Challenges in Agent-Based Modeling for Geo-Spatial Simulation (2008) Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 32 (6), pp. 417-430; Crooks, A., Wise, S., GIS and Agent-Based Models for Humanitarian Assistance (2013) Journal of Computer, Environment and Urban System, 41, pp. 100-111; Hartmann, T., Zerjav, V., Optimizing the Location of Out-Care Centers in Urban Space Using Agent-Based Modeling (2014) Construction Research Congress 2014 ©aSCE, pp. 2375-2384; Kruzikas, D.T., Higashi, M.K., Edgar, M., Macal, C.M., Graziano, D.J., North, M.J., Collier, N.T., Using Agent-Based Modeling to Inform Regional Health Care System Investment and Planning (2014) International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence, pp. 1-4; Anh, N.T.N., Daniel, Z.J., Hung, M.N., Alexis, D., Simulation of Emergency Evacuation of Pedestrians Along the Road Networks in Nhatrang City (2012) International Conference on Research, Innovation, and Vision for the Future (RIVF), pp. 309-314; Axelrod, R., Tesfatsion, L., Judd Kenneth, L., Leigh, T., (2006) Handbook of Computational Economics, 2. , (North-Holland) A Guide For Newcomers to Agent-Based Modeling in The Social Sciences; Bunch, M.J., Kumaran, T.V., Joseph, R., Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for Spatial Planning and Environmental Management in India: Critical Considerations (2012) International Journal of Applied Science and Technology, 2, pp. 40-54","Khair, F.; Industrial Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: fauzi.khair@binus.ac.id","Kasih T.P.","","Institute of Physics Publishing","International Conference on Eco Engineering Development 2017, ICEED 2017","14 November 2017 through 15 November 2017",,133427,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

A homemade flyback transformer was utilized to power up this gas-phase plasma system and its electrical characteristics were presented in the form of voltage amperage waveforms. UV/Vis analysis was employed to monitor the influence of plasma treatment time on the decreasing of MB concentration as well as to measure the decoloration efficiency. It was found that the decoloration efficiency of MB solution can reach 93% after 120 minutes of plasma treatment to result in transparent water. Furthermore, FTIR analysis was performed to recognize the differences in MB organic functional groups before and after plasma treatment and to confirm the mineralization process that was occurred during plasma irradiation. During plasma irradiation, the interaction between hydroxyl radicals and other various reactive species transforms the organic pollutants into the harmless sediments through complex chemistry reactions. Due to all of the plasma treatments were carried out without the addition even a single chemical; it can be conclude that nonthermal plasma system may potentially become one of the competitive environmentally friendly techniques in destruction and decoloration of an organic polluted solution such as textile wastewater. © RASĀYAN.

The plasma itself was generated by an in-house high voltage power supply (HVPS). Instead of gas-phase plasma system, we applied plasma jet system underwater during wastewater treatment without additional any chemicals (chemical-free processing). The method is thought to maximize the energy transfer and increase the efficient interaction between plasma and solution during the process. Our plasma jet system could proceed either by using helium (He), argon (Ar) and air as the medium in an open air atmosphere. Exploring the developed plasma to be applied in organic wastewater treatment, we demonstrated that the plasma jet could be generated underwater and yields in color degradation of methylene blue (MB) wastewater model. When using Ar gas as a medium, the color degradation of MB could be achieved within 90 minutes. Whereas, by using Ar with an admixing of oxygen (O2) gas, the similar result could be accomplished within 60 minutes. Additional O2 gas in the latter might produce more hydroxyl radicals and oxygen-based species which speed up the oxidative reaction with organic pollutants, and hence accelerate the process of color degradation. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","color degradation; non-thermal plasma; organic pollutant; wastewater treatment","Aromatic compounds; Color; Energy transfer; Indicators (chemical); Plasma jets; Pollution; Reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Color degradation; Efficient interaction; High voltage power supply; Hydroxyl radicals; Nonthermal plasma; Organic wastewater treatment; Oxidative reaction; Plasma jet system; Organic pollutants",,,,"0422/K3/KM/2017","The author would like to acknowledge the financial support from Indonesia Ministry of Research Technology and Higher Education through the Research Grant Number: 0422/K3/KM/2017.","Vineta, S., Silvana, Z., Sanja, R., Golomeova, S., Methods for Waste Waters Treatment in Textile Industry (2014) International Scientific Conference, 3, pp. 248-252; Abdelmalek, F., Ghezzar, M.R., Belhadj, M., Addou, A., Brisset, J.L., Bleaching and Degradation of Textile Dyes by Nonthemal Plasma Process at Atmospheric Pressure (2006) Industrial and Engineering Chemical Research, 45 (1), pp. 23-29; Tichonovas, M., Krugly, E., Racys, V., Hippler, R., Kauneliene, V., Stasuilaitiene, I., Martuzevicius, D., Degradation of various textile dyes as wastewater pollutants under dielectric barrier discharge plasma treatment (2013) Chemical Engineering Journal, 229, pp. 9-19; Kasih, T.P., Investigation of the Non-Thermal Plasma-Based Advanced Oxidation Process for Removal of Organic Contaminants in Azo Dyes Solution (2017) Journal of Ecological Engineering, 18 (2), pp. 1-6; Reddy, M.K., Bendi, R., Reddy, L., Challapalli, S., Degradation and mineralization of methylene blue by dielectric barrier dicharge non-rhermal plasma (2013) The Chemical Engineering Journal, 217, pp. 41-47; Ma, Y., Gong, X., He, B., Li, X., Cao, D., Li, J., Xiong, Q., Li, Q.H., (2017) On the Estimation of the Dissolved Hydroxyl Radicals in the Plasma-liquid System Using the Molecular Probe Method; Nehra, V., Kumar, A., Dwivedi, H.K., Atmospheric Non-Thermal Plasma Sources (2008) International Journal of Engineering, 2, pp. 53-68; Foster, J.E., Plasma-based water purification: Challenges and prospects for the future (2017) Physics of Plasma, 24 (5)","Kasih, T.P.; Industrial Engineering Department, Indonesia; email: tkasih@binus.edu","Kasih T.P.","","Institute of Physics Publishing","International Conference on Eco Engineering Development 2017, ICEED 2017","14 November 2017 through 15 November 2017",,133427,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

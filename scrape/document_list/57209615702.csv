The new services and technology were expected to utilize their existing virtualized resources without introducing any additional hardware. The goal of this study was to provide a secure network infrastructure design for the Kubernetes deployment in their Data Center. Network and security were still viewed as important aspects and focus. This study provided a design with network recommendations from the likes of Cisco and VMware, and Forrester’s Zero Trust model as its security guideline. Each of the recommendations has been evaluated and written through this study. The simulation results showed that the proposed design was able to conform with the enterprise’s requirements and constraints, and successfully applying Zero Trust’s requirement in the container networks. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"Containers; Ubiquitous computing; Web services; Digital services; Financial service; Financial services industries; Micro services; New services; Secure networks; Trust modeling; Virtualized resources; Network security",,,,,"Acknowledgments.

There are many people whose the living standards are under poverty line. It is caused by the community mindset, unequal education level, and high competitiveness in the world of work. Hence, there are many social-based businesses for improving the community welfare by giving various aids both in form of workforce, training, and funds. The more the number of companies in the social sector is, it certainly needs a tool that can illustrate this business as a whole. The impacts of social business are social impact and economic impact. It is about how those two impacts can be coexisted, provide positive things to many people, and improve the growth of the company significantly. This research aimed to understand the illustration of the business model in social business that can give social impact and economic impact and appropriate strategy to the company. Thereby, it can improve the competitiveness and provide the literature review about the concept and the social practice of enterprise in Indonesia. Social Business Model Canvas is a business model commonly applied to a social-based business so that it can map the business out effectively. © 2020, Allied Business Academies.

This research focuses on the background capabilities of WhatsApp Status that allow resellers to market their products based on capabilities of WhatsApp Status as part of social media, as a channel to deliver the value proposition to the customer, and as a means of supporting engagement between sellers and buyers. The qualitative approach was carried out by involving selected active users of WhatsApp Status based on Snowball Sampling. This research identifies the significant capability of WhatsApp Status as the main digital marketing channel for resellers in marketing their products where WhatsApp Status allows attachment between resellers and customers while WhatsApp itself is the most used chat application. However, WhatsApp Status has limited functionality only as a marketing channel with all the capabilities of social media in general. © Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering & Sciences Publication.","Attachement theory; Channel; Digital media; Marketing; Reseller; WhatsApp; WhatsApp Status",,,,,,"Bowlby, J., (1969) Attachment and Loss: Volume I Attachment (2nd ed, 1. , New York: Basic Books; Broch, C., Lurati, F., Zamparini, A., Mariconda, S., The Role of Social Capital for Organizational Identification: Implications for Strategic Communication (2017) International Journal of Strategic Communication, 12 (1), pp. 46-66; Brock, D., (2009) Aftersales Management: Creating a Successful Aftersales Strategy to Reduce Costs, Improve Customer Service and Increase Sales, , London, United Kingdom: Kogan Page Publishers; Bryman, A., (2012) Social Research Methods (4th ed.), , New York: Oxford University Press Inc; Bryman, A., Bell, E., (2011) Business Research Methods 3e, , Oxford, UK: OUP Oxford; Bukalapak, (2018) Tentang Bukalapak, , https://www.bukalapak.com/about, Retrieved November 2, 2018, from; Caers, R., De Feyter, T., De Couck, M., Stough, T., Vigna, C., Du Bois, C., (2013) Facebook: A literature review, , New Media and Society; Chellappa, R.K., Sin, R.G., Personalization versus Privacy: An Empirical Examination of the Online Consumer ' s Dilemma (2005) Information Technology and Management, 6 (2-3), pp. 181-202; Church, K., de Oliveira, R., (2013) What’s up with whatsapp?: Comparing mobile instant messaging behaviors with traditional SMS, pp. 352-361. , 15th International Conference on Human- Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services (MobileHCI’13); Couldry, N., (2012) Media, Society, World: Social Theory and Digital Media Practice; Cambridge: Polity; Creswell, J.W., (2014) Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches (4th ed.), , California: SAGE Publications, Inc; Daymon, C., Holloway, I., (2010) Qualitative Research Methods in Public Relations and Marketing Communications (2nd ed.), , Routledge; Denzin, N.K., Lincoln, Y.S., (2003) Strategis of Qualitative Inquiry (2nd ed.), , California: SAGE Publications, Inc; Edwards, D., Ho, L., Choi, S., Media, Mobilities and Identity in East and Southeast Asia: Introduction (2017) Cultutral Studies Review, 23 (1), pp. 60-68; Fill, C., (2009) Marketing Communications: Interactivity, Communities and Content, , Harlow, Edinburgh: Pearson Education Limited; Fogli, L., Ukei, J., (2005) Customer Service Delivery: Research and Best Practices, , Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons; Galloway, L., Rowbotham, F., Azhashemi, M., (2012) Operations Management in Context; Abingdon, United Kingdom: Routledge, , United Kingdom: Routledge; Jordan, Z., The effect of promotion mix elements on Consumers Buying Decisions of Mobile Service: The case of Umniah Telecommunication Company at Zarqa city- Jordan (2016) European Journal of Business and Management, 8 (5), pp. 94-100; Kaniewska-Sċba, A., Pilarczyk, B., (2014) Negative Effects of Personalization in Direct Marketing; Marketing International Journal of Arts & Sciences, 7 (2), pp. 89-98; Karjaluoto, H., Mustonen, N., The Role of Digital Channels in Industrial Marketing Communications (2015) Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing, 30 (6), pp. 703-710; Kemp, S., (2018) Digital In 2018 In Southeast Asia; Kern, F.G., The Trials and Tribulations of Applied Triangulation: Weighing Different Data Sources (2018) Journal of Mixed Methods Research, 12 (2), pp. 166-181; Kothari, C.R., (2004) Research Methodology: Methods & Techniques, , New Age International; (2nd ed.).

Automatic vehicle detection and license plate recognition are employed to detect the traffic violation. To automatically detect the vehicle, Tiny-DSOD object detection is utilized, which has been proven for real-time performance. Then, Tiny-DSOD and WPOD-NET are combined to detect the unconstrained license plate with better performance and accuracy. Finally, a novel license plate recognition network is introduced to detect the characters in the license plate. Those methods are integrated into a web-based system to detect traffic violations in real time automatically. Experimental results show the performance of each module in the proposed system. The proposed DSWPOD-NET is confirmed to have less parameter and higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art WPOD-NET due to integration between Tiny-DSOD backend and WPOD license plate detector. © 2020 ICIC International.

A university located in South Jakarta has implemented an integrated system with e-learning portals for lecturers and students, but the success of the information system implementation has never been measured. As we know, the investment of information systems implementation could cost a lot of resources, time, and cost, which makes the measurement of the success of information systems a very important thing to do. The aim of this research is to measure the success of the e-learning system that was implemented in the university using the updated DeLone and McLean IS Success model (2003), with the objective to understand whether implementing an e-learning model really helped produced organizational benefits in the university such as good corporate image, and also to understand whether or not the updated DeLone and McLean IS Success model could really be used to assess the success of implementing e-learning in the university. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","D&m is success model; E-learning; Education; University",,,,,,"Chang, C.-C., Exploring the determinants of e-learning systems continuance intention in academic libraries (2013) Libr.

Traditional personality assessments are done by having individuals participate in personality tests. There are several weaknesses to this approach, namely that it is time consuming, and test participants could have made up their answers. A new approach of personality prediction is explored by merely evaluating the contents of a user's social media account. This paper provides an overview on the development of personality prediction from text on social media, the common issues faced in performing said task, and further improvements that can be applied in the future. © 2017 IIJ.","Linguistic analysis; Natural language processing; Personality prediction; Social media",,,,,,"(2016) Merriam-Webster.com, , http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/socialmedia, [Accessed: 16-Sep-2016]; (2015) GlobalWebIndex, , ""GlobalWebIndex Social Report Q1/2015,""; Quan-Haase, A., Young, A.L., Uses and Gratifications of Social Media: A Comparison of Facebook and Instant Messaging (2010) Bull.

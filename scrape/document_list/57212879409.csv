Improvement of motivation and enjoyment could be influenced by player personality. As there is a variety of personalities, gamification application developers should consider including various gameplay to adapt with each personality type. There is a need for adaptive gamification framework. This paper intends to propose an adaptive gamification framework with proper player classification and effectiveness evaluation method. This paper focuses on introducing gamification framework by combining adaptive gameplay, dynamic difficulty adjustment, Big Five personality model, player performance, and evaluation method to measure player motivation and enjoyment to see the effectiveness of gamification applications such as IMMS and eGameFlow.

This study analyses the internal and external environment of companies for formulating alternative strategies during the planning process of strategy formulation. The main focus of this research is to choose the best alternative strategy based on each factor and sub-factor of the SWOT analysis, where the strengths and opportunities are treated as advantages and weaknesses and threats are treated as costs. This research was completed using the Analytic Network Process (ANP) and Fuzzy Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The incorporation of the ANP and Fuzzy TOPSIS methods is proposed at the end of the study and can be applied with a SWOT analysis to formulate the best alternative strategy. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","ANP; Fuzzy TOPSIS; Group decision-making; Multi-criteria determination analysis; SWOT analysis",,,,,,"Alptekin, N., Intergration of SWOT analysis and TOPSIS method in strategic decision-making process (2013) The Marcotheme Review, 2 (7), pp. 1-8; Amiri, M.P., Project selection for oil development by using AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS (2010) Expert System with Application, 37 (9), pp. 6218-6224; Ashtiani, B., Haghighirad, F., Makui, A., Montazer, G.A., Extension of fuzzy TOPSIS method based in interval-valued fuzzy sets (2008) Applied Soft Computing, 8 (2), pp. 457-461; Astuti, P., (2014) Penerapan Metode Fuzzy ANP Dan TOPSIS Dalam Penentuan Strategi Pemasaran [Application of ANP and TOPSIS Fuzzy Methods in Determining Marketing Strategy], , (Undergraduate Thesis), Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia, Indonesia; Azimi, R., Yazdani-Chamzini, A., Fouladgar, M., Zavadskas, E., Basiri, M., Ranking the strategies of mining sector through ANP and TOPSIS in a SWOT framework (2011) Journal of Business Economics and Management, 12 (4), pp. 670-689. , http://dx.doi.org/10.3846/16111699.2011.626552; Bruno, T.R., Ivana, B., Evaluation of Croatian development strategies using SWOT analysis with fuzzy TOPSIS method and k-means method (2015) Journal of Economics, Business and Management, 3 (7), pp. 687-693; David, F.R., (2011) Strategic Management, , Jakarta: Salemba Empat; Elu, B., Management of consumer complaints handling in service industry (2005) Jurnal Ilmu Administrasi Dan Organisasi, Bisnis Dan Birokrasi, 13 (3), pp. 1-13; Lynch, R., (2009) Strategic Management, , England: Pearson Education Limited; Mohamad, D., Ibrahim, S.Z., Decision making procedure based on Jaccard similarity measure with z-numbers (2017) Pertanika Journal of Science and Technology, 25 (2), pp. 561-574; Nasab, H.H., Milani, A.S., An improvement of quantitative strategic planning matrix using multiple criteria decision making and fuzzy numbers (2012) Applied Soft Computing, 12 (8), pp. 2246-2253; Onut, S., Soner, S., Transshipment site selection using the AHP and TOPSIS approaches under fuzzy environment (2007) Waste Management, 28 (9), pp. 1552-1559; Rouhani, S., Mehdi, G., Mostafa, J., Evaluation model of business intelligence for enterprise system using fuzzy TOPSIS (2012) Expert System with Application, 39 (3), pp. 3764-3771; Tanjung, H., Devi, A., (2013) Metode Penelitian Ekonomi Islam [Islamic Economic Research Methods], , Jakarta: Gramata Publishing; (2015) Special Report Optimisme pertumbuhanekonomiIndonesia:Pembangunan Industri Indonesia (2015-2019) – Bagian 1 [Optimism of Indonesia’S Economic Growth: Indonesian Industrial Development (2015-2019) – Part 1], , http://vibizmedia.com/2015/07/31/pembangunan-industri-indonesia-2015-2019-bagian-1/, Retrieved October 20, 2016; Yuksel, I., An integrated approach with group decision making for strategy selection in SWOT analysis (2011) International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences, 2 (11), pp. 134-161","Simamora, B.H.; Department of Management, Indonesia; email: bsimamora@binus.edu",,,"Universiti Putra Malaysia",,,,,01287702,,,,"English","Pertanika J.

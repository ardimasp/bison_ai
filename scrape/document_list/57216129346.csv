However, this detection only can be felt as long as the length of the stick from its handle is as far as the reach of the hand. Seeing this limitation, a set of sonar vision was made using sonar sensor, which equipped as a wristwatch and a buckle of a belt. The sonar vision was designed to detect an obstacle for up to 3 meters away. A hundred low vision people already got the benefit of this system, which 84% of them felt that the sonar vision helped them in the navigation. The new design based on the feedback is presented in this paper, which is equipped with GPS for positioning information. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","blind; GPS; low vision; obstacle detection; sonar","Felt; Felts; Obstacle detectors; Sonar; blind; Low vision; Obstacle detection; Positioning information; Sonar sensor; Vision impaired; Global positioning system",,,,,"This project is financially supported by Indonesian Government support program for new technology-based company (CPPBT) under contract No. 75/PKS/Kp/PPK.2/CPPBT/IV/2018.","Alper, S., Raharinirina, S., (2006) Assistive Technology and Mild Disabilities, 21, pp. 47-64; Stefanov, D.H., Bien, Z., Bang, W.C., The smart house for older persons and persons with physical disabilities: Structure, technology arrangements, and perspectives (2004) IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 12 (2), pp. 228-250; Abdallah, E.E., Fayyoumi, E., Assistive Technology for Deaf People Based on Android Platform (2016) Procedia Computer Science, 94, pp. 295-301; Howe, P., Cyborg and Supercrip: The Paralympics Technology and the (Dis)empowerment of Disabled Athletes (2011) Sociology, 45 (5), pp. 868-882; Rose, F.D., Brooks, B.M., Rizzo, A.A., Virtual reality in brain damage rehabilitation (2005) Cyberpsychology & Behavior, 8 (3), pp. 241-262; Lopresti, E.F., Mihailidis, A., Kirsch, N., Assistive technology for cognitive rehabilitation: State of the art (2004) Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 14 (1-2), pp. 5-39; Lederman, R., Wadley, G., Gleeson, J., Bendall, S., Álvarez-Jiménez, M., Moderated online social therapy: Designing and evaluating technology for mental health (2014) ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI), 21 (1), p. 1; Faria, J., Lopes, S., Fernandes, H., Martins, P., Barroso, J., Electronic white cane for blind people navigation assistance (2010) 2010 World Automation Congress; (2018) Ultracane-the Safer Way to Travel, , https://www.ultracane.com/, UltraCane Ultracane, 25 May [Online] [Accessed 29 July 2019]; (2018) Mahasiswa BINUS Ciptakan Sonar Vision Untuk Bantu Tuna Netra, , https://binus.ac.id/2018/10/mahasiswa-binus-ciptakan-sonar-vision-untuk-bantu-tuna-netra/, B.

During 16 years of service in fulfilling the citizens' need of transportation, Transjakarta is considered to have a fairly good performance, remarked with the addition of 13 corridors until renovation of the bus fleets. In the era of Jakarta Smart City, Transjakarta is now available at citizens' service. The connected transport application (X), which was renowned as the official partner for Jakarta Smart City, is a route-finding application which can be downloaded freely in the citizen smartphone. It has some features which facilitates the users in gaining the information about Transjakarta, such as locating the station nearby, navigating bus position, and looking at bus schedule. X itself, is already implemented in the transportation system of four big cities in Europe (Berlin, London, Prague, and Vilnius). To investigate whether the existence of this application really affects Transjakarta passengers, we have performed a survey-based research by visiting the largest and the busiest Transjakarta station at Harmoni, in the capital. The Transjakarta passengers are interviewed to get an information about how effective X in providing information about Transjakarta. As the result of this research, the respondents are divided into three groups: those who know X and using it, those who know X, but don't use it, and those who don't know about X at all. © 2020 IEEE.","Connected transport; Indonesia; Mobile application; Passengers; Transjakarta","Information management; Smart city; Bus fleets; Indonesia; Mobile applications; Public transportation; Route findings; Survey-based research; Transport applications; Transportation system; Buses",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

The increasing amount of production will also affect the increasing demand for freight forwarding services. The faster a product reaches the end consumer, the faster the economical turnover of a country will occur. However, reality does not always happen like that, especially in Indonesia. The high cost of transportation often weighs on end consumers to buy products. So that there is a decrease in purchasing power from consumers due to the cost of production, which is too expensive. The problem of logistics is one of the crucial things that must always be a concern for all of us. In this study, a web-based freight forwarding application was built to facilitate the integration process between several freight forwarding operators to service the demand for goods distribution from producers to end consumers. The goal is, of course, to accelerate the process of distribution of goods, tidy up the administrative process, and increase the savings in the cost of shipping goods, because the sourcing of resources is integrated and well allocated. So that the difficulty of waiting time can be shortened and used for more useful activities. © 2019 IEEE.","logistics information systems; logistics management; small medium sized companies; software development life cycle; web-based shipping application.","Application programs; Information management; Life cycle; Ships; Software design; Websites; Logistics information systems; Logistics management; Medium-sized companies; Shipping applications; Software development life cycle; Distribution of goods",,,,,"Lie, Y., Atmojo, R.N.P., Muljo, H.H., The effectiveness of o2o strategy on e-commerce transactions (2019) The Winners, 20 (1), pp. 9-17; Atmojo, R.N.P., Rekening bersama (rekber) the Indonesian escrow service of money (2016) Int.

Mobility is increasingly demanded along with broadband. Certain to locations do not have the necessary infrastructure for broadband. Users that are residing in fixed locations will be able to access broadband service. They could access high-speed access line and enjoy for broadband services offered by service providers. The operators provide both conventional copper cables and fiber optic cables as access lines. Sometimes it is not possible for users that are nomadic or mobile to obtain broadband access line. Quite often small and medium-sized companies need to have an alternative solution to access broadband lines that are economic and technically simple. In the mean time, cellular service providers offer 3G Internet services with nationwide coverage to access the Internet. 3G service has reasonably high transmission speed. We had performed a similar research but changes in the platform and algorithm in the router challenged us to ensure sustainability of the concept. This research still develops an application that uses multi 3G services to provide broadband access. The solution that is being developed should sustain its economic nature and simplicity. Using available multiple 3G connections, a user can access large files of information through virtual high speed channel anytime and any where. A technique of paralleling multiple lower speed channels to obtain a virtual high-speed channel is called inverse multiplexing. To simplify the technique a router that has the ability to provide load balancing to several WAN lines is chosen. The inverse multiplexing concept through a number of channels with 3G services can run well for downloading files from a Web Server as shown by laboratory experiments and field measurements. © 2016 IEEE.","3G; Inverse Multiplexing; Load balancing","Cables; Internet service providers; Multiplexing; Multiplexing equipment; Resource allocation; Speed; Technical presentations; Telecommunication lines; Web services; Alternative solutions; High transmission; High-speed access lines; High-speed channels; Information contents; Inverse multiplexing; Laboratory experiments; Small and medium-sized companies; Electronic document exchange",,,,,"Tanutama, L., Wijaya, R., Alexander, K., Wiratama, A., Indraswara, R., A novel broadband line construction using 3g service (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 19-26; Qiu, R.C., Zhu, W., Zhang, Y., Third-generation and beyond (3.5g) wireless networks and its Applications (2002) IEEE International Symposium.

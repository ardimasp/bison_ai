However, very few remain to study the design process or the game model of Game-Based Learning. This paper explains how the framework is implemented to a game best suited for Game-Based Learning in Security Studies classroom. The aim of this study is to define and develop a game best suited for enhancing learning outcomes of National Defense Strategy subject in International Relations Department. The research implements MDA Framework in the development process of the game. The implementation process is done using IT-BluTric framework. IT-BluTric framework lists all processes that needed to be done. After several processes are done, feedbacks from field expert are collected. The questions for the feedbacks are linked to the 4 Key Characteristics of a Learning Game (challenge, curiosity, fantasy, control), which has a deep correlation with MDA Framework. The final result is an assessment of using IT-BluTric framework in developing a Game-Based Learning, along with feedbacks for the game. The conclusions are hoped to give insights on how MDA Framework is implemented in a Game-Based Learning and the whole development process could serve as a reference to other Game-Based Learning applications. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Game engineering; Game-based learning; IT-BluTric framework; MDA framework; Video game",,,,,,"van Eck, R., (2006) Digital Game-Based Learning: It’s Not Just the Digital Natives Who are Restless, , Educause Review, March/April; Prensky, M., Digital Game-Based Learning (2007) Paragon House, St. Paul; Erhel, S., Eric, J., Digital game-based learning: Impact of instructions and feedback on motivation and learning effectiveness (2013) Comput.

A learning method called Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL) is used to replace old learning methods with a digital game to learn. This research aims to propose the best method of DGBL design and development to create game prototypes for subject applied by International Relations Department of Bina Nusantara University. This research focuses on developing DGBL for the concept of Prisoner's Dilemma and taking the case study of Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in International Relations Studies. The research uses literature review to back up design theories and survey to determine the basic foundation of prototypes creation. Based on the research surveys, it is concluded that prototypes will apply mobile as the platform, use simulation as the genre, and adopt the style of old American cartoon. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bins; Computation theory; Computer games; Design; Game theory; Learning systems; Surveys; Design and Development; Digital game-based learning; International relations; Learning methods; Literature reviews; Prisoner's dilemma; Prototype designs; Research survey; E-learning",,,,,"Dawes, R.M., Social Dilemmas (1980) Annual Review of Psychology Ed, 31 (1), pp. 169-193; Ohdaira, T., Terano, T., Cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma Game Based on the Second-Best Decision (2009) Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, 12; Perrota, C., Featherstone, G., Aston, H., Houghton, E., (2013) Game-Based Learning: Latest Evidence and Future Directions., , NFER Research Programme: Innovation in Education; Aleven, V., Myers, E., Easterday, M., Ogan, A., Toward a Framework for the Analysis and Design of Educational Games (2010) IEEE Conference on Digital Game and Intelligent Toy Enhanced Learning (DIGITEL), pp. 69-76; Ruhi, U., Towards a Descriptive Framework for Meaningful Enterprise Gamification (2015) Technology Innovation Management Review, 5, pp. 5-16; Zin, N.A., Yue, W.S., Design and Evaluation of History Digital Game-Based Learning Software (2013) Journal of Next Generation Information Technology, 4; Sommerville, I., (2010) Software Engineering, p. 9. , Addison-Wesley; Piskurich, G.M., (2006) Software Engineering, p. 396",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Computing and Applied Informatics, ICCAI 2016","14 December 2016 through 15 December 2016",,127044,17426588,,,,"English","J.

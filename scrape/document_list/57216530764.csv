Therefore the school needs to create a framework, methods and management practices in managing IS/IT in the school. The design of the E-Learning system at Kanisius School uses the Enterprise Architecture approach with Zachman Framework which is a reference in developing IS/IT in an organization or company. Besides, Enterprise Architecture utilizes information and communication technology to support the organization's operational activities and enhance the ability of data integration between parts of the organization. For modeling using UML such as Use Case Diagram and Activity Diagram described using PowerDesigner software by SAP. The results of this study are a blueprint of E-learning systems in Kanisius School. This Blueprint can be used as a reference in the future for developing the E-Learning system at Kanisius School. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The competition between e-commerce is done to attract many customers so that they are interested to buy. Therefore, e-commerce is using many strategies e.g. value creation brand (ambassador, image, and origin). The purpose of this research is to look at the effect of brand value creation (ambassador, image, and origin) on the purchase intention of e-commerce customers in Indonesia. There are 3 hypotheses stated at the beginning of the research and to prove the hypothesis, 412 questionnaires were distributed for this research. The questionnaires are analyzed with multiple regression using Smart-PLS 3. The results of this research showed that brand image and origin affect the purchase intention of e-commerce customers in Indonesia while brand ambassador does not affect. © IJSTR 2020.","Brand ambassador; Brand image; Brand origin; E-commerce; Purchase intention; Value; Value creation brand",,,,,,"Ferdinand, (2002) Manajemen Pemasaran.

One form of TELs, that is on-screen learning, has been well understood to hinder learning experience due to the reading spatial instability, difficulties in establishing mental map, and poor visual ergonomics. This work intends to study to which extend a learning a recommendation system improving on-screen learning experience. Participants were randomly divided into two groups: one group learning with the learning recommendation system and the other is without the system. Their understanding were assessed and a t-test was performed. The results indicated that the average score of learning with the recommendation system was significantly higher and the detrimental effects were mitigated. © 2016 IEEE.","e-learning; Learning recommendation systems; on-screen learning; portable document format; technology enhanced learning","E-learning; Ergonomics; Recommender systems; Group learning; Learning experiences; Mental maps; on-screen learning; Portable document formats; T-tests; Technology enhanced learning; Education",,,,,"Wertsch, J.V., Commentary on: Deliberation with computers: Exploring the distinctive contribution of new technologies to collaborative thinking and learning (2003) International Journal of Educational Research, 39 (8), pp. 899-904. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035504001028, deliberation with computers: exploring the distinctive contribution of new technologies to collaborative thinking and learning; Manouselis, N., Drachsler, H., Vuorikari, R., Hummel, H., Koper, R., Recommender systems in technology enhanced learning (2011) Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 387-415. , Springer; Eklundh, K.S., Problems in achieving a global perspective of the text in computer-based writing (1992) Instructional Science, 21 (1), pp. 73-84; Baccino, T., Pynte, J., Spatial coding and discourse models during text reading (2004) Language and Cognitive Processes, 9, pp. 143-155; Piolat, A., Roussey, J.Y., Thunin, O., Effects of screen presepresent on text reading revising (1997) International Journal of Human-computer Studies, 47 (4), pp. 565-589; Mangen, A., Walgermo, B.R., Bronnick, K., Reading linear text on paper versus computer screen: Effects on reading comprehension (2013) International Journal of Educational Research, 58, pp. 61-68; Ackerman, R., Goldsmith, M., Megacognitive regulation of text learning: On screen versus on paper (2011) Journal of Experimental Phsychology: Applied, 17 (1), pp. 18-32; Garland, K.J., Noyes, J.M., CRT monitors: Do they intefere with learning (2004) Behavior and Information Technology, 23 (1), pp. 43-52; Noyes, J.M., Garland, K.J., Vdt versus paper-based text: Reply to mayes, sims, and koonce (2003) International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, 31, pp. 411-423; Dobrescu, L.I., Greiner, B., Motta, A., Learning economics concepts through game-play: An experiment (2015) International Journal of Educational Research, 69, pp. 23-37. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035514000810; Katyal, K.R., Evers, C.W., Teacher leadership and autonomous student learning: Adjusting to the new realities (2004) International Journal of Educational Research, 41 (4-5), pp. 367-382. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035505000558; Winne, P.H., Students calibration of knowledge and learning processes: Implications for designing powerful software learning environments (2004) International Journal of Educational Research, 41 (6), pp. 466-488. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035505000601; Niemiec, R.P., Walberg, H.J., The effects of computers on learning (1992) International Journal of Educational Research, 17 (1), pp. 99-108. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0883035592900458; Littleton, K., Wegerif, R., Special issue on deliberation with computers: Exploring the distinctive contribution of new technologies to collaborative thinking and learning (2003) International Journal of Educational Research, 39 (8), pp. 787-791. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035504000916, deliberation with computers: exploring the distinctive contribution of new technologies to collaborative thinking and learning; Säljö, R., Learning and technologies, people and tools in co-ordinated activities (2004) International Journal of Educational Research, 41 (6), pp. 489-494. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035505000613; Mukama, E., Strategizing computer-supported collaborative learning toward knowledge building (2010) International Journal of Educational Research, 49 (1), pp. 1-9. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035510000303; Näykki, P., Järvelä, S., Kirschner, P.A., Järvenoja, H., Socio-emotional conflict in collaborative learninga process-oriented case study in a higher education context (2014) International Journal of Educational Research, 68, pp. 1-14. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088303551400069X; Black, K., (2010) Business Statistics for Contemporary Decision Making, , John Wiley & Sons; Hindarto, Sumarno, Feature extraction of electroencephalography signals using fast fourier transform (2016) CommIT (Communication & Information Technology).

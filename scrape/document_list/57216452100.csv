Comments taken from social media such as Twitter, does not provide a rating system which can help to classify comments based on their rating score. The goal of this study is to build a comment classification model using Word2vec and SVM classifier that can classify comments based on a rating scale from 1-5. The training data will be taken from user comments from play.google.com website in which each comment already has a rating. The purpose of the model is to classify comments from social media about mobile network applications. Comment classification is performed in order to help these businesses, as well as the users, to know the overall satisfaction of users who use these applications. The best F1 score obtained from this research using class elimination and stop word removal is 0.795. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

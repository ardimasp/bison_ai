Therefore, the authors conducted research related to the use of English in teaching Mathematics, for grade 7 junior high school in a private national plus school. The purpose of this study is for the reader to open up further insights related to the topic above. This research was carried out with experimental design, by doing different treatment between classes in the same level. The subjects of the study consisted of 63 students spread into 3 classes, 7 Amos, Esther 7 and 7 Jonah. Class 7 Jonah is a control group, using Bahasa Indonesia (mother tongue) in learning Mathematics. Class 7 Amos and 7 Esther is the experimental group, where 7 Amos in English and 7 Esther used bilingual (English and Indonesian). Results of the study include the following: the use of English is not detrimental to the students in score acquisition, is evident from the class treated differently, giving an average final score of Mathematics that are not significantly different. The obstacles that arise in learning Mathematics needs to be reviewed from the process, readiness, independence, motivation of students and needs to be followed up critically so that students can achieve good results. Programs of short and long term needs to be created and observed in order to support the learning process of Mathematics for students, such as training teachers to be able to speak English, training teachers to teach Mathematics, especially for young children, to support action research by teachers, managed by the school. © 2017 IEEE.","English; Learning; Mathematics","Educational technology; Mathematical techniques; Personnel training; Students; Teaching; Action research; Different treatments; English; Experimental groups; Junior high schools; Learning; Learning Mathematics; Learning process; Education",,,,,"Bernardo, A.B.I., Language and mathematical problem solving among billinguals (2002) The Journal of Psychology.

The concern of this research is based on student factors, especially the motivation of students to learn. There are many factors to motivate students to learn and one of them is learning interest. This research proposes to describe the contribution of learning interests against the learning motivation. To describe this contribution, this research chooses Character Building Course at Binus University as a study case. All students at Binus University have to take Character Building class. This research described how student’s interest correlated with the motivation of the students in learning Character Building. Based on the quantitative method, this research concluded that there is a correlation between a student’s interest and the student’s motivation in learning Character Building Course. The contribution of the student’s interest against the student’s motivation in learning Character Building is 9.7%. Because of the correlation is very weak, this research recommended to undergo advancing research that based on multiple variable both internal and external motivation, either on student’s level, lecturer, learning facility, teaching learning activities or learning system as whole. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.","Learning interest; Learning motivation",,,,,"Binus University","Hurst, J., Carbone, A., Mitchell, I., Gunstone, A.M., (2009) An Exploration of Internal Factors Influencing Student Learning of Programming, , http://crpit.com/confpapers/CRPITV95Carbone.pdf; Ormrod, J.E., (2011) Educational Psychology, Developing Learners, , 7th edn., Pearson, Boston; Santrock, J., (2008) Educational Psychology, , 3rd edn., The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc., New York; Schiefele, U., (1991) Educational Psychologist, 26, p. 299; Krapp, A., (1999) European Journal of Psychology of Education 1999, 14, p. 23; Djamrah, S.B., (2008) Psikologi Belajar, , Edisi 2, Rineka Cipta, Jakarta; Syah, M., (2006) Psikologi Belajar, , Raja Grafindo Persada, Jakarta","Ruman, Y.S.; Character Building Development Center, Jl.

Design/methodology/approach: Research data was collected from the executive management of telecommunication technology providers in Indonesia via a questionnaire survey to obtain 150 valid questionnaires for analysis. This study analyzed the overall model fit through confirmatory factor analysis and causal relationships through structural equation modeling. Findings: The results indicate that market orientation mediates the link between balanced APM and strategic agility and that strategic agility mediates the link between market orientation and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The choice of single telecommunication industry in a single country, Indonesia, provides a limitation on external validity. It is, therefore, suggested to extend the research efforts to other industry sectors in multi-country environments. Originality/value: This study extends the knowledge about agile project management by embracing balancing control enforcement and tests it empirically. This study also re-conceptualizes strategic agility to embrace business partner switching capability and market orientation to embrace the inter-partner coordination dimension. Finally, the results highlight that agile project management needs to be framed by market orientation to create higher value for customers. However, market orientation alone is not enough and that the organization requires strategic agility to achieve firm performance. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Balanced agile project management; Firm performance; Firm performance; Market orientation; Strategic agility; Telecommunication",,,,,,"The authors are grateful to the Co-Editors, Assoc.

Design/methodology/approach: Research data were collected from the executive management of telecommunication technology providers in Indonesia via a questionnaire survey to obtain 150 valid questionnaires for analysis. This study analyzed the overall model fit and causal relationship using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings: The results indicate that market orientation fully mediates the link between networking capability-business process agility and balanced APM-business process agility. Furthermore, business process agility mediates the relationship between market orientation and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This study is based on a cross-sectional nature and might fail to capture the dynamic of the studied variables over an extended period. Originality/value: The study extends the knowledge that dynamic capabilities, represented by networking capability and balanced APM, must be framed by market orientation to create customer value and improve bargaining position. However, market orientation alone is not enough in a highly dynamic business environment. Organization also requires business process agility, responsiveness and adaptability to timely address customers' needs and requirements. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business process agility; Firm performance; Market orientation; Networking capability, Balanced agile project management",,,,,,,"Aghina, W., Smet, A.D., Lackey, G., Lurie, M., Murarka, M., (2018) The 5 trademarks of agile organizations, , https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/the-five-trademarks-of-agile-organizations; Agirre, I., Reinares, P., Agirre, A., Antecedents to market orientation in the worker cooperative organization: the Mondragon group (2014) Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, 85 (3), pp. 387-408; Aguirre, F.H., Azcoitia, S.A., Marcos, C.S., (2019) Disrupting Telco Business Through SDN/NFV, , Deloitte, Madrid; Ahlbäck, K., Fahrbach, C., Murarka, M., Salo, O., (2017) How to create an agile organization, , https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/how-to-create-an-agile-organization; Ahuja, G., The duality of collaboration: inducements and opportunities in the formation of interfirm linkages (2000) Strategic Management Journal, 21, pp. 317-343; Alavi, S., Wahab, D.A., Muhamad, N., Shirani, B.A., Organic structure and organisational learning as the main antecedents of workforce agility (2014) International Journal of Production Research, 52 (21), pp. 6273-6295; Alpkan, L., Yilmaz, C., Kaya, N., Market orientation and planning flexibility in SMEs: performance implications and an empirical investigation (2007) International Small Business Journal, 25 (2), pp. 152-172; Altay, N., Gunasekaran, A., Dubey, R., Childe, S.J., Agility and resilience as antecedents of supply chain performance under moderating effects of organizational culture within the humanitarian setting: a dynamic capability view (2018) Production Planning and Control, 29 (14), pp. 1158-1174. , Taylor and Francis; Ambroise, L., Prim-allaz, I., Teyssier, C., Financial performance of servitized manufacturing firms: a configuration issue between servitization strategies and customer-oriented organizational design (2017) Industrial Marketing Management, 71, pp. 54-68. , Elsevier; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: a review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 411-423; Anderson, E., Jap, S.D., The dark side of close relationships (2005) MIT Sloan Management Review, 46 (3), pp. 75-82; Andersson, T., Cäker, M., Tengblad, S., Wickelgren, M., Building traits for organizational resilience through balancing organizational structures (2019) Scandinavian Journal of Management, 35 (1), pp. 36-45. , Elsevier; Annosi, M.C., Magnusson, M., Martini, A., Appio, F.P., Social conduct, learning and innovation: an abductive study of the dark side of agile software development (2016) Creativity and Innovation Management, 25 (4), pp. 515-535; Arnett, D.B., Sandvik, I.L., Sandvik, K., Two paths to organizational effectiveness – product advantage and life-cycle flexibility (2018) Journal of Business Research, 84 (March), pp. 285-292; Atkinson, H., Brown, J.B., Rethinking performance measures: assessing progress in UK hotels (2001) International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 13 (3), pp. 128-136; Atuahene-Gima, K., Ko, A., An empirical investigation of the effect of market orientation and entrepreneurship orientation alignment on product innovation (2001) Organization Science, 12 (1), pp. 54-74; Bajpai, R., Nesargi, S., Merchant, K., Pareek, V., (2015) Operationalizing SDN and NFV Networks, , Deloitte Consulting LLP, Dallas, Texas; Balashova, E.S., Gromova, E.A., Agile project management in telecommunications industry (2017) Espacios, 38, p. 41; Barnabas, N., Mekoth, N., Autonomy, market orientation and performance in Indian retail banking (2010) Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics, 22 (3), pp. 330-350; Barney, J., Firm resource and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Barney, J.B., Ketchen, D.J., Wright, M., The future of resource-based theory: revitalization or decline?

It was conducted among 67 companies in the financial industry listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange. The research was conducted using a cross-sectional study with a questionnaire to obtain a response from top management, during the period of May to November 2016. Multivariate analysis was done to test the hypothesis, using Structural Equation Modelling based on variance or Partial Least Square (PLS). In the research, it was found that implementation of corporate governance had a negative impact on competitive advantage, but had a positive effect on financial performance. Application of E-Business had a positive impact on financial performance, while the application of innovation had a positive effect on competitive advantage and financial performance. This research also confirmed that competitive advantage had a positive impact on the company's financial performance. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Competitive advantage; Corporate governance; E-business; Financial performance; Innovation",,,,,,"The authors wish to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika journal team that help publish this article.","Abdullah, A., Page, M., (2009) Corporate governance and corporate performance: UK FTSE 350 Companies, , Edinburgh, Scotland: The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland; Bahri, S., Yahya, D.

Design/methodology/approach: Research data was collected from the executive management of telecommunication technology providers in Indonesia via a questionnaire survey to obtain 150 valid questionnaires for analysis. This study analysed the overall model fit and hypotheses through confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Findings: The results reveal that networking capability has a positive and significant effect on market orientation. However, networking capability does not have a significant direct effect on business process agility. The results also indicate that market orientation does not have a significant direct effect on firm performance but through the mediating role of business process agility. Practical implications: The findings provide a practical foundation for the organisation’s networking capability to be framed by market orientation and business process agility to enhance firm performance. Originality/value: The results indicate that market orientation mediates the relationship between networking capability and business process agility. The findings also reveal that business process agility mediates the relationship between market orientation and firm performance. This study also reconceptualises market orientation to embody the inter-partner coordination dimension and reconceptualise business process agility to embody business partner switching capability. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business process agility; Firm performance; Market orientation; Networking capability; Telecommunication",,,,,,,"AguirreAzcoitia, F.H., Marcos, C.S., (2019) Disrupting telco business through SDN/NFV, , https://www2.deloitte.com/es/es/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/disrupting-telco-business-through-SDN-NFV.html#, accessed April 13, 2019; AhlbäckFahrbachMurarka, K., Salo, O., (2017) How to create an agile organization, , www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/how-to-create-an-agile-organization, accessed July 26, 2018; Ahuja, G., The duality of collaboration: inducements and opportunities in the formation of interfirm linkages (2000) Strategic Management Journal, 21 (3), pp. 31-343; Ahuja, G., Katila, R., Technological acquisitions and innovation performance of acquiring firms: a longitudinal study (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22 (3), pp. 197-220; Alpkan, L., Yilmaz, C., Kaya, N., Market orientation and planning flexibility in SMEs: performance implications and empirical investigation (2007) International Small Business Journal: Researching Entrepreneurship, 25 (2), pp. 152-172; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modelling in practice: a review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 411-423; Anderson, E., Jap, S.D., Dark side of close relationships (2005) MIT Sloan Management Review, 46 (3), pp. 75-82; Arnett, D.B., Sandvik, I.L., Sandvik, K., Two paths to organizational effectiveness: product advantage and life-cycle flexibility (2018) Journal of Business Research, 84, pp. 285-292; Atuahene-Gima, K., Exploratory analysis of the impact of market orientation on new product performance (1995) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 12 (4), pp. 275-293; BajpaiNesargiMerchant, R., Pareek, V., (2015) Operationalizing SDN and NFV networks, , https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/operationalizing-sdn-and-nfv-networks.html, accessed April 13, 2019; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., Moderator–mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51 (6), pp. 1173-1182; Battistella, C., De Toni, A.F., De Zan, G., Pessot, E., Cultivating business model agility through focused capabilities: a multiple case study (2017) Journal of Business Research, 73, pp. 65-82; Baum, J.A.C., Tony, C., Silverman, B.S., Do not go it alone: alliance network composition and startups’ performance in Canadian biotechnology (2000) Strategic Management Journal, 21 (3), pp. 267-294; Behrman, D.N., Perreault, W.D., Measuring the performance of industrial salespersons (1982) Journal of Business Research, 10 (3), pp. 355-370; Berthon, P., Hulbert, J.M., Pitt, L.F., To serve or create?

Major research questions pursued were: What is the influence of entrepreneurial process on the green business environment concept? What is the influence of cost effectiveness of membrane-based technology of the water system on the green business environment concept? What is the influence of entrepreneurial process on the sustainable competitive advantage of a pharmaceutical firm? What is the influence of cost effectiveness of membrane-based technology in a water system on the sustainable competitive advantage in a pharmaceutical firm? What is the influence of a green business environment concept on sustainable competitive advantage for a pharmaceutical firm? The research was conducted from a sample of 206 pharmaceutical member-firms of the Indonesian Pharmaceutical Association (GP FARMASI). The result of this research verified that the entrepreneurial process has a significant positive influence on the green business environment and sustainable competitive advantage. Furthermore, cost effectiveness also has significant positive influence on green business environment but has no significant influence on sustainable competitive advantage. Therefore, cost effectiveness and the entrepreneurial process membrane-based technology was suggested as an effective strategy to create a green business environment and achieve sustainable competitive advantage in the pharmaceutical industry. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt.

In Indonesia, the construction industry has contributed more than ten percent of GDP during the last five years, which is greater than Indonesia's economic growth that only constitutes around 5% annually. However, large-scale construction companies are still producing low performance. The purpose of this study is to find out the effect of managing innovation and technological adoption on business performance through the strategy of differentiation in Indonesia's construction industry. The research methods include a descriptive method through scoring analysis and verification method by quantitative analysis. Focus Group Discussion was also conducted for validation of the questionnaire responses. The observation process used time horizon that has cross section/one shot nature in 2019. The research respondents were large-scale construction companies domicile in six provinces in Java Island, including DKI Jakarta, East Java, Central Java, Banten, West Java and DI Yogyakarta, which were determined by proportional sampling of 90 companies. The order of sampling was taken from the largest company turnover in each province. Data was analysed by Partial Least Square (PLS) software. The result shows that managing innovation and technological adoption contribute to improving business performance through differentiation strategy. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Business performance; Construction industry; Differentiation strategy; Managing innovation; Technological adoption",,,,,,,"Best, R.J., (2009) Market-Based Management: Strategies For Growing Customer Value and Profitability, , 3rd Ed.

Furthermore, it also elaborates how organizational agility is shaped by the interdependence of the main antecedents―sales-marketing interdepartmental collaboration, complete market-oriented integrated product development (IPD) strategy, and nimble network structure. Exploratory case study and literature review are used to examine the interrelationship of organizational agility antecedents and to develop the conceptual framework. The study identifies that in highly dynamic, rapidly changing, and complex digitized business environments of Telecommunication 4.0 era, to achieve competitive advantage, organizations are required to become agile, which is becoming responsive and flexible in delivering continuous innovation and customer-focused solution through rapid experimentation and decisiveness. To fully gain organizational agility, the collaborative role of sales and marketing in guiding and supporting research and development (R&D) is crucial for product development success. Further, the whole organization needs to embrace an agile mindset and working under a nimble network structure and project management arrangement. Derived from resource dependence theory, the originality of this study lies on the elucidation of collaboration and integration among functional specialists working under nimble project-based network structure that bring positive impact on the accomplishment of product development collective task and responsiveness in satisfying customer’s requirement. This study is expected to enrich prior studies on organizational agility from a different perspective. © 2019 SERSC.","Business performance; Nimble network structure; Organizational agility; Product development; Sales and marketing collaboration",,,,,,,"Ravichandran, T., Exploring the relationships between IT competence, innovation capacity and organizational agility (2018) J.

Garuda Indonesia is a Flag Carrier of the largest archipelago national, which cover three different time zones. This study aims at analyzing the airline pilot's fatigue contributors at Boeing 737 fleet, the short to medium haul flight operation workhorse of Garuda Indonesia, which fly domestic and regional flights. While in the aviation industry, most of the human factors related fatigue research focused on long-haul pilots, since the exposure of their duties towards jet-lag. However, short-haul pilots experience of flight operation of less than 8 hours flight time per flight sector, multiple flight sectors a day, with the set of two pilots for each rotation pattern causes their elevated levels of fatigue.

Two online transportation service companies that are still operating and competing are GO-JEK and GRAB. The purpose of this study is understanding the condition of e-marketing, service quality and repurchase intention of Grab and GoJek as online transportation and to determine the effect of e-marketing and service quality on repurchase intentions. The method of collecting data uses a questionnaire distributed to 100 residents of South Jakarta. The data analysis method used in this study is multiple regression analysis using the SPSS application. The sampling technique is probability sampling techniques - simple random sampling. The statistics center of DKI Jakarta Province on January 30, 2017 noted that residents of South Jakarta who had used online transportation services were 2,185,711. Then determining the size and number of samples using Slovin technique sampling with 10% margin error, so that the number of samples to be examined is as much as 99,995 rounded up to 100 samples. Partially, the variable quality of service dominates its influence on repurchase intention variables with t arithmetic 5.201, while t count e-marketing variable is 1.436. T count e-marketing is smaller than t table 1.984. So, it can be concluded that service quality has a significant effect on repurchase intention while e-marketing does not have a significant effect on repurchase intention. © 2019 IEEE.","e-Marketing; repurchase intention; service quality","Commerce; Information management; Marketing; Regression analysis; Data analysis methods; E-marketing; Multiple regression analysis; Probability sampling; Repurchase intention; Service Quality; Simple random sampling; Transportation services; Quality of service",,,,,,"(2017) Traffic Scorecard, , http://inrix.com/scorecard/; Kahraman, C., Yazici, I., Karasan, A., Digital marketing and consumer engagement: Concepts, methodologies, tools, and applications (2018) Hershey: IGI Global; Prasetyo, H.D., Purbawati, D., Pengaruh e-service quality dan e-security seals terhadap e-satisfaction melalui keputusan pembelian konsumen e-commerce (studi kasus pada konsumen lazada Indonesia) (2016) Jurnal Administrasi Bisnis, 5, pp. 127-134; Argote, L., Ingram, P., Knowledge transfer: A basis for competitive advantage in firms (2000) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 82 (1), pp. 150-169; Hutter, K., Hautz, J., Dennhardt, S., Fuller, J., The impact of user interactions in social media on brand awareness and purchase intention: The case of mini on facebook (2013) Journal Product & Brand Management, pp. 342-351; Yoo, C.W., Kim, Y.J., Sanders, G.L., The impact of interactivity of electronic word of mouth systems and e-quality on decision support: In the context of e-marketplace (2015) Information and Management, pp. 1-32; Royle, J., Laing, A., The digital marketing skills gap: Developing a digital marketer model for the communication industries (2014) International Journal of Information Management, pp. 65-73; Al-Weshah, G., E-marketing practices from jordanian tourism agencies perspectives: A qualitative evidence (2018) International Journal of Online Marketing, pp. 21-36; Saghier, N.E., Nathan, D., Service quality dimensions and customers satisfactions of banks in Egypt (2013) Proceedings of 20th International Business Research Conference, pp. 1-13; Pena, M.M., Melleiro, M.M., Batalha, E.M., The use of the quality model of parasuraman, zeithaml and berry in health services (2013) Revista da Escola de Enfermagem da USP, pp. 1227-1232; Al-Tit, A.A., The effect of service and food quality on customer satisfaction and hence customer retention (2015) Asian Social Science, 11, pp. 129-139; Prasetya, F.N., So, I.G., Pengaruh e-marketing dan ecrm terhadap e-loyalty website usaha komunikasi pemasaran (2014) Jurnal Binus Business Review, pp. 8-17; Soebagyo, T., Subagio, H., Analisa pengaruh store image terhadap purchase intention di toserba ramai ngawi (2014) Jurnal Manajemen Pemasaran, 1, pp. 1-9; Ireland, R.D., Hitt, M.A., Sirmon, D.G., A model of strategic entrepreneurship: The construct and its dimensions (2003) Journal of Management, 29 (6), pp. 963-989; Rekettye, G., Rekettye, G., Jr., Global trends and their influence on future business performance (2013) International Journal of Business Performance Management, 14 (1), pp. 95-110",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","4th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2019","19 August 2019 through 20 August 2019",,152147,,9781728133331,,,"English","Proc.

This study examines the crucial role of project management office (PMO) practices in strategic initiative implementation, measured by the performance of banks taken from year 2014 to 2016. Empirical research was conducted through a survey, by using questionnaires to assess the contribution of PMO practices in managing strategic initiatives in Indonesian banks. A set of data from 74 top executives, representing 115 banks was collected. The variables for the strategic initiative implementation are project portfolio management capabilities, project management office practices, and performance of the banks reflected by their return on assets (ROA) analyzed and compared through Partial Least Square- Structural Equation Model method using SmartPLS 3.0 software. The results show that PMO practices have positively influenced the project portfolio management capabilities. Subsequently, the strategic initiative implementation which is influenced by project portfolio management capabilities has produced significant influence on the ROA. © 2019 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Banks; Initiatives; Portfolio; Project; Strategic",,,,,,,"Aubry, M., Hobbs, B., Thuillier, D., A new framework for understanding organizational project management through the PMO (2007) International Journal of Project Management, 25 (4), pp. 328-336; Aubry, M., Hobbs, B., Thuillier, D., The contribution of the project management office to organizational performance (2009) International Journal of Managing Projects in Business, 2 (1), pp. 141-148; Aviliani, Siregar, H., Maulana, T., Hasanah, H., The impact of macroeconomic condition on the bank's performance in Indonesia (2015) Buletin Ekonomi Moneter Dan Perbankan, 17 (4), pp. 379-402; Barkema, H., Schijven, M., Toward unlocking the full potential of acquisition: The role of organizational restructuring (2008) Academy of Management Journal, 51 (4), pp. 696-722; Barney, J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Barreto, I., Dynamic capabilities: A review of past research and an agenda for the future (2009) Journal of Management, 36 (1), pp. 256-280; Boppel, M., (2013) Strategic Initiative Portfolios : Theory and Empirical Evidence, , (Doctoral thesis), University of St Gallen, Switzerland; Boubakri, N., Mirzaei, A., Samet, A., National culture and firm performance of the banks: Evidence from the recent financial crisis (2017) Journal of Financial Stability, 29 (4), pp. 35-56; Dai, C.X., Wells, W.G., An exploration of project management office features and their relationship to project performance (2004) International Journal of Project Management, 22 (7), pp. 523-532; Daniel, E.M., Ward, J.M., Franken, A., A dynamic capabilities perspective of IS project portfolio management (2014) Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 23 (2), pp. 95-111; Dietrich, P., Lehtonen, P., Successful management of strategic intentions through multiple projects: Reflections from empirical study (2005) International Journal of Project Management, 23 (2005), pp. 386-391; (2013) Why Good Strategies Fail: Lessons for the C-Suite, , https://mosaicprojects.com.au/PDF/PMO-Why-Good-Strategies-Fail_Report.pdf, Economist Intelligence Unit.

Diverges from prior studies on organizational agility, the study identifies that a complete market orientation of integrated product development (IPD) implementation maximizes organization's responsiveness toward the dynamics of customers' requirements and competitors' activities. Furthermore, exploratory case studies find that as Telecommunication 4.0 brings up new challenges and complexities created by open innovation and hardware-software decoupling, organizations need to leverage networking with partners and exploit organizational structure nimbleness to gain optimal product development capability. The conceptual framework is formed from both the exploratory case studies and systematic literature review. The case studies enable us to gain state-of-the-art views from practitioners in the industry, clarify the fuzziness and broad nature of antecedents, and integrate them into existing theories to acquire managerial insight. Aligned with market-based and dynamic capability theory, the originality of this study lies on how organizations exploit not only internal resource flexibility, but also how to access, configure, and leverage external network capabilities embedded in business partners. © 2019 Chaoyang University of Technology.","Business performance; Business process agility; Integrated product development; Market-oriented; Networking capability; Nimble organizational structure",,,,,,,"Susanne, H., Jeff, L., Paul, S., (2018) Succeeding in the age of digital transformation: TMT Frontrunners lead the way for the Industry 4.0 revolution, , https://www2.deloitte.com/cz/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/succeeding-in-the-age-of-digital-transformation.html#; Zhengmao, L., (2018) Telecommunication 4.0: Reinvention of the Communication Network, , Singapore-Springer; Ahlbäck, K., Clemens, F., Monica, M., Olli, S., (2017) How to create an agile organization, , https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/how-to-create-an-agile-organization; (2018) Mobile & Telecom, , https://ihsmarkit.com/products/telecommunication-market.htm; Youngki, P., Omar, A.E.S., Peer, C.F., (2017) J.

Not only adds a new perspective in the strategic decision-making process framework, but also suggests new perspectives of firms, environment, institutions and indigenous characteristics as the new approach that magnifies strategic decision-making’s models with respect to SMEs’ scale. Design/methodology/approach: The purposive sampling method has been used in this study. First, we used the CEO as the respondent to fulfilll decision involvement criteria. Second, the samples were selected based on the criterion that the last project of this SME has finished in the last 3 years. Then we choose a project bidding decision from construction SMEs to minimize decision bias. Finally, from 4253 SMEs listed in Papua, we finished with 350 respondents. The study had collected 156 SME's project decisions. Findings: The Heuristic decision, that previously neglected because of information bias and short decision process, deemed to be the most profound dimension in strategic decision making and demonstrated significant results toward SMEs’ project performance. All variables, exclude institution, shows good and significant results. The research uses project decision in the construction industry as the main unit analysis. Practical implications: Exploring strategic decision-making theory in the SME context could convince SME’s CEO to evaluate its external factors before taking a project, processing all the information needed toward its project performance.

In the digital business industry, innovative work behaviour has been considered as a key performance indicator. Individual performance becomes the basis of the company performance which will further increase the value of the company. This study employs the paradigm of positive psychology, focusing on how performance improvement can be achieved by increasing employee work well-being. Previous studies show that there is an inconsistency in the relationship between work well-being and performance. So, it needs to be understood further through the role of mediation variables that can explain when an employee work wellbeing can improve performance. This study aims to examine the role of employee organisational commitment as a mediator of the relationship between employee work well-being and innovative work behaviour. Taking the digital business industry in Indonesia as a research context, this research reveals that employee organisational commitment fully mediated the relationship between employee work well-being and innovative work behaviour.

However, research related to employee well-being and organizational commitment of millennial generation is still difficult to find in Indonesia. This study aims to investigate the role of psychological capital and organizational fit to employee well-being and organizational commitment of millennial employees in e-commerce industry in Indonesia. Data were collected through a survey of 288 millennial employees who work in e-commerce industry in Jakarta, Indonesia. By using structural equation modelling, we found that employee well-being and organizational commitment are positively associated with both psychological capital and organizational fit, while employee well-being also mediates the relationship between psychological capital and organizational fit toward organizational commitment. The results contribute to better understanding of attitude of millennial generation in general and specifically to the predictors of employee well-being and commitment at work, especially in e-commerce industry. Furthermore, this research also provides both theoretical and managerial implications explaining the contribution of human factors in e-commerce industry as well as limitations of this study and direction for future research. © IEOM Society International.","Business management; E-Commerce; Human factors; Millennial generation; Organizational commitment",,,,,,,,"Nangoy, R.; Doctor of Research in Management, Indonesia; email: rizalmmgd@gmail.com",,"Eaton;INFORMS (Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences);Siemens","IEOM Society","8th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management, IEOM 2018","6 March 2018 through 8 March 2018",,138293,21698767,9781532359446,,,"English","Proc.

Currently, only around one-third Indonesian own bank account which was relatively low compared to cellular phone penetration that reached 123.1% in 2014. Based on this fact, Telkomsel launched its mobile money, T-Cash Tap, so that customers can do financial transactions using mobile phones. However, in its implementation, mobile money in Indonesia still has some issues, such as awareness, regulations, and low rate of industry attractiveness. The research was conducted to understand the business environment of T-Cash in Indonesia and to develop a business model for T-Cash Tap. Qualitative approach is used in this research through secondary data which taken from relevant reports, journals, and articles regarding mobile money. To support the qualitative data, a survey was conducted using questionnaires sent by mail to 130 Telkomsel's subscribers consist of 79 male and 51 female. Following the survey result analysis, a business model is proposed to be implemented by Telkomsel in aim to increase its mobile money usage. © 2016 IEEE.","business model canvas; e-Money; less cash society","Cellular telephones; Information management; Mobile phones; Surveys; Telephone sets; Business environments; Business model development; Business modeling; Financial transactions; less cash society; Qualitative approach; Qualitative data; Secondary datum; Electronic money",,,,,,"(2013) 2013 Economic Report on Indonesia, , http//www.bi.go.id/en/publikasi/laporantahunan/perekonomian/Pages/lpi_2013.aspx, Bank Indonesia; (2015) Indonesia Telecommunications Report Q2 2015-Includes 5 Year Forecasts to 2019, , http//search.proquest.com/docview/1648812674/fulltextPDF/62B70D87073D4061PQ/1accountid=31562, Business Monitor International; Camner, G., Snapshot: Implementing mobile money interoperability in Indonesia (2013) Mobile Money for the Unbanked, pp. 1-11. , http//www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wpcontent/uploads/2013/10/Implementing-mobile-money-interoperabilityin-Indonesia.pdf; Dewi, S., Prospek pembayaran non tunai (2014) Gerai Info: Newsletter Bank Indonesia, 50, p. 10; Ghosh, A., Why cash is still king: Examining the effectiveness of alternate delivery channels (2014) The Mobile Money & Digital Payments Asia 2014, , Jakarta.

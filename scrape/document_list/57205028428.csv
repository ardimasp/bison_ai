From the application that went through very important developments from desktop-based applications to web-based applications to mobile-based applications as the latest development. But maintenance of mobile applications will be done more often, because the mobile applications are very dependent on the application service and API used to retrieve data in the database and to display information that is displayed in mobile applications. The goal is to discover the preparation that needs to be done by the developer so that the transfer of technology to micro services still gives the user a comfortable feeling without any interference. Preparing for migration from monoliths to microservices is modularization of application source code, modularization of databases and cloud servers such as the Google cloud platform if you want to stay on your own server © 2020 IEEE.","Application; Microservices; Migrating; Monolith","Application programming interfaces (API); Mobile computing; Modular construction; Web services; Application services; Cloud platforms; Latest development; Mobile applications; Modularizations; Organizational management; Transfer of technology; Web-based applications; Information management",,,,,,"Richardson, C., (2016) Refactoring A Monolith into Microservices-NGINX, , https://www.nginx.com/blog/refactoring-a-monolith-intomicroservices/, [Accessed: 15-Jul-2019]; Larrucea, X., Santamaria, I., Colomo-Palacios, R., Ebert, C., (2018) Microservices; Ren, Q., Li, S., Method of refactoring a monolith into microservices (2018) J.

The disabilities can take a form as hearing impaired. We, at Distance Education Binus Online Learning (BOL), were keen to observe the implementation of ADAB (Ayo Dengar Ayo Bicara) To Connect application for hearing-impaired students in video conference sessions. The current study was aimed at seeking learning model innovations in data and text mining courses as well as measuring impacts of ADAB to Connect application to hearing-impaired students' academic performances. It was observed that by implementing the application, the students' academic performance was elevated to 90%. We, therefore, are convinced that this learning innovation worths further study and improvisation. © 2019 Kassel University Press GmbH.","ADAB; Distance-earning; Hearing-impaired; Innovation","Audition; Education computing; Learning systems; Students; Text mining; Academic performance; Conference sessions; Hearing impaired; Human being; Learning models; Online learning; Persons with disabilities; Physical barriers; E-learning",,,,"Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Tinggi, DIKTI","General Director Pensus Belmawa DIKTI to fully fund this article.","(2016) Salinan Undang Republik Indones Nomor 8 Tahun 2016 Tentang Penyandang Disabil, 2016 (147), pp. 11-40. , https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/xtdba; (2012) Kementrian Kesehatan Republik Indonesia.

The growth of online learning program faces issue and challenge in assuring the completion of students' learning outcomes. The completion of them will represent the effectiveness of the learning process in online environment, so that it can gain trust from the public in terms of quality of education. For accommodating this need, the research has been conducted in order to propose an application design for measuring the completion of students' learning outcomes in online learning environment. Design application will follow the methodology of system development life cycle (SDLC) with waterfall approach. The design of functional, data, and user interface will be the output of this research. It should also be concerned that every questions in assessment must be related to the learning outcomes, so they could be stored and used as a basis for learning outcomes completion report. © 2019 IEEE.","application design; learning outcomes; learning outcomes completion; online learning","Computer aided instruction; Information management; Students; User interfaces; Application design; Design applications; Educational institutions; Learning outcome; Online learning; Online learning environment; Quality of education; System development life cycles; E-learning",,,,,,"Lile, R., Bran, C., The assessment of learning outcomes (2014) Procedia-Soc.

One of the biological factors from water quality is the life of macro benthos organisms. In some existing studies macro benthos is usually used as a bioindicator of water quality. The presence of a specific macro benthos family or macro benthos organism that has similarities in the aquatic environment signifies the water quality level. Such extreme environmental changes provide a macro benthos life tolerance value called the Biotic Factor Index (BFI). The purpose of this publication is Knowing the relationship between the biotic index and water quality, SQL syntax to calculate the Biotic Index from the input of each sampling point, the design of the system that accommodates each macro benthos findings from each sampling point in a water. The biotic value from spring to autumn is 2.59, 2.68, 3.22, 3.42, all of them is in very good water quality. © 2018 IEEE.","biotic family index; design system analyze; macro benthos; water quality","Aquatic ecosystems; Aquatic organisms; Information management; Water quality; Aquatic environments; Biological factors; biotic family index; Design systems; Environmental change; Household activities; Macro benthos; Production activity; Potable water",,,,,,"Mandaville, S.M., Benthic macroinvertebrates in freshwaters-Taxa tolerance values, metrics, and protocols (2002) Soil Water Conserv.

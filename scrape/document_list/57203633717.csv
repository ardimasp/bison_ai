Internet is a tool that is used to access information through a website. The SISIK Website is a site used to calculate the population prediction in a region at a certain time. The aims of this research is to apply the website-based logistic model with migration factors as the function of the population in predicting a population in a region. The SISIK Website was developed by using waterfall software development method which covers the analysing, designing, implementing, testing, maintaining, and documenting phase. The modelling technique described from this research is Unified Modelling Language (UML). The results of this website are prediction reports on population in a region which can be a solution for policy makers like government or entrepreneurs to determine the relevant decisions for certain aspects such as the population, economy, education, as well as social and cultural aspects. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Population; Prediction; Reports; Waterfall; Website",,,,,,"Adamu, A., Zainon, W.M., (2017) Multiview Similarity Assessment Technique of UML Diagrams, pp. 311-318; Borelli, R., Coleman, C., (1987) Differential Equation, A Modelling Approach, , New Jersey: Prentice-Hall Inc; Deema, A., Jawad, B., Similarity Calculation Framework for Heterogeneous Multimedia Web (2018) Journal of Information Technology and Software Engineering, 8 (2); Dooley, J.F., (2017) Software Development, Design and Coding, , New York: Springer Science+Business Media New York; Edwards, C., Penney, D., (2008) Elementary Differential Equations, Sixth Edition, , New Jersey: Prentice-Hall Inc; Filipova, O., Vilão, R., (2018) Software Development From A to Z, , New York: Springer Science+Business Media; Fransisca, D.C., Marbun, P., Population of Purwanegara vilaage, Indonesia using model logistic with migration factor (2018) International Journal of Enginering and Technology, pp. 1962-1969; Harper, S., (2016) How Population Change Will Transform Our World, , New York: Oxford University Press; Lynn, P., Terrera, G.M., Hardy, R., O'Muircheartaigh, C., Skinner, C., Lehtonen, R., Population sampling in longitudinal surveys (2015) Longitudinal and Life Course Studies; Prahono, A., Elidjen, Evaluating the Implementation of Public Information Disclosure on the Official Website of Indonesian Ministries (2017) Computer Science, pp. 54-60; Rakhim, A.A., (2015) Model Logistik dengan Migrasi dan Aplikasinya pada Data Penduduk Kelurahan Purwanegara Kecamatan Purwokerto Utara, , Universitas Jendral Soedirman; A semi-automated approach to adapt activity diagrams for new use cases (2015) Information and Software, p. 57; Sun, H., Nguyen, T., Luan, Y., Jiang, J., Classified Mixed Logistic Model Prediction (2018) Journal of Multivariate Analysis, 168, pp. 63-74; Wang, J., McCue, S.W., Simpson, J., Extended Logistic Growth Model For Heterogeneus Population (2018) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 445, pp. 51-61; Hsiao, C.M., Zhang, W.F., Chiu, C.C., Huang, J.C., Huang, Y.L., The Enterprise Risk Management of Foreign Exchange Exposures: Evidence from Taiwanese Hospitality Industry (2017) Asian Journal of Economics and Empirical Research, 4 (1), pp. 32-48","Fransisca, D.C.; Department of Information Technology, SMP 5 Karang Klesem Street, Indonesia; email: diandrachika10181993@gmail.com",,,"Primrose Hall Publishing Group",,,,,22011315,,,,"English","Int.

Many studies have been carried out on population growth model concerning the factors of birth, death and carrying capacity in order to predict the number of population at certain area. From these studies there is only one study involved the constant value factor of migration as an input in the logistic model. Therefore contradicting with the above modified logistic model, in this study logistic model is modified by adding a migration factor as a function of population. This function takes into account the migration and the interaction between peoples that is limited to the carrying capacity of the environment. This model can be solved qualitatively using the analysis of equilibrium point and quantitatively using the separable variables method. This modified logistic model with migration factor has been applied in the population prediction of Purwanegara village in Central Java Province, Indonesia. Throughout the results, the modified logistic model with migration factor as a function of population gives a better result for population prediction of Purwanegara village in Central Java Province, Indonesia compared with logistic model. © 2018 Diandra Chika Fransisca, Padosroha Marbun.","Carrying capacity of environment; Intrinsic growth; Logistic model; Migration; Population",,,,,,"(2015) 15 Tahun Lagi, Jumlah Populasi Dunia akan Capai 8, 5 Miliar, , http://nationalgeographic.co.id/2015/07/15-tahun-lagi-jumlahpopulasi-dunia-akan-capai-8-5-miliar, Retrieved March 3 2016; (2013) Strategi Pembangunan Kependudukan dan Kebijakan yang Ditempuh di Era Global, p. 3. , Malang: Universitas Negeri Malang; Mantra, I.B., (2003) Demografi Umum, , Jakarta: Pustaka Belajar; Borrelli, R., Coleman, C.S., (1987) Differential Equation, a Modelling Approach, , New Jersey: Prentice-Hall Inc; Edwards, C.H., Penney, D.E., (2008) Elementary Differential Equations, , Sixth Edition.

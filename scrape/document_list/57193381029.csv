It shows that more formal and adaptable strategic planning and relevant synergy mentality based on the understanding of environmental turbulence level, helps maintain and increase a firm’s competitiveness.

The study used the descriptive research design and the conceptual framework was tested using a multiple regression model. Data were collected using questionnaires distributed to senior managers, general managers and directors of manufacturing companies in Indonesia. The hypotheses were analysed using IBM SPSS. The results suggest that not only does strategic planning have a direct impact on a firm's performance but also on the mediating role of synergy mentality. In support of past findings, the present study shows that strategic planning has a positive relationship related to a firm's performance especially with synergy mentality within a firm's managerial levels. The present study is one of the first to empirically examine and confirm the mediating role of synergy mentality on strategic planning and firm performance. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Firm performance; Strategic planning; Synergy mentality",,,,,,"Ansoff, H.I., (1988) The New Corporate Strategy, , New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

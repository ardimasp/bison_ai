But, if there is a spatial effect in the data, it must use a spatial model. This is because the independent variables that influence dependent variable can be different at each location. Spatial autoregressive (SAR) model is a spatial method that can be used to describe the relationship between dependent variable and independent variables by considering spatial impact. Before SAR model is carried out, it must be tested for spatial effect using Moran's I. This is used to ensure that there are spatial effect in the data. Because if there is no spatial effect, then can be use a global model, that is linear regression model using Ordinary Least Square (OLS). In this paper, OLS and SAR model was used on average expenditure data of Papua. Expenditures must be made by each region in Indonesia due to subsidies from the central government. Papua is a province that has the highest average expenditure compared to other provinces. Therefore, the average expenditure becomes important thing that needs to be considered by the government of Papua. This is because there must be equal distribution of expenditure at each district / city in Papua. The result of this research indicated that there is a spatial effect on the average expenditure data in Papua. Comparison result of OLS model and SAR model showed that SAR model is better than OLS model. Because MAPE, AIC and RMSE of SAR model are smaller than OLS. © 2019 The Authors.

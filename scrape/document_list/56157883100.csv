The study focus on developing a model of interactions with the components within the learning environment along with the Learning Management System features that can be used to support the interactions. In this paper we propose an Interaction and Learning Model in E-learning using Learning Management System (LMS). In this approach the LMS acts as a hub that connects every actor and element in the e-learning and acts as a platform where all the e-learning activities will take place. The model emphasizes the relation between the learner's interactions and learning to the type of e-learning and features practiced inside a LMS. © 2005 – on going JATIT & LLS.","E-learning; Features in LMS; Interaction; Interaction model; Learning model; LMS",,,,,,"Anderson, T., Getting the Mix Right Again: An updated and theoretical rationale for interaction International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, 4 (2). , October; Albarrak, A.I., Aboalsamh, H.A., Abouzahra, M., Evaluating Learning Management Systems for University Medical Education (2010) International Conference on Education and Management Technology (ICEMT), 2010, pp. 672-677; Effendi, Z., (2005), E-learning, Konsep dan Aplikasi, Andi; Henderson, A., (2003) The E-Learning, Question and Answer, , American Management Association, New York; Turban, E., (2004) Electronic Commerce: a Managerial Perspective, , Pearson Prentice Hall, New Jersey; Martin, F., Parker, M., Deale, D., Examining Interactivity in Synchronous Virtual Classrooms International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, 13 (3), pp. 228-261. , June; Woods, R., Baker, J., Interaction and Immediacy in Online Learning (2004) International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, 5 (2). , August; Rye, S., Negotiating the symbolic power of information and communication technologies (ICT): The spread of Internet-supported distance education (2009) Information Technology for Development, 15, pp. 17-31; van Dijk, J., (2005) The Deepening Divide: Inequality in the Information Society, , London: Sage; Jaiswal, V., Current Status of E-Learning in Indian Higher Education: A Case Study of U.P, , http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2231910, (Accessed on 30 June 2013); Swan, K., Relationships Between Interactions and Learning In Online Environments (2004) The Sloan Consortium; Muhirwa, J., Teaching and Learning Against all Odds: A Video-Based Study of Learner-to-Instructor Interaction in International Distance Education (2009) International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, 10 (4). , September; Murugaiah, P., Thang, S., Development of Interactive and Reflective Learning among Malaysian Online Distant Learners: An ESL Instructor’s Experience (2010) International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, 11 (3), pp. 21-41. , October; Weng, D., Cuzzola, J., Brown, L., Kinshuk, Instructor-Aided Asynchronous Question Answering System for Online Education and Distance Learning (2012) International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, 13 (5), pp. 102-125. , Nov; Lynn McBrien, J., Cheng, R., Jones, P., Virtual Spaces: Employing a Synchronous Online Classroom to Facilitate Student Engagement in Online Learning (2009) International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, 10 (3). , June; Annand, D., Social Presence within the Community of Inquiry Framework (2011) International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, 12 (5), pp. 40-56. , May",,,,"Little Lion Scientific",,,,,19928645,,,,"English","J.

The aim of this case study is to design a web based customer service information system to improve service quality and efficiency in a call center. The results are based on a single case studying a certain manufacturer of ceramic sanitary wares and plumbing hardware company in one of the countries it operates. Considering there were several significant issues which directly affect the level of customer satisfaction. The objectives of the system are to manage the technician schedule to do a visit based on the customer preference, to facilitate better escalation of unclosed processed problems after certain duration of time and to generate various types of reports for the use of the management. Furthermore the ability to enable the system to be used by new call center planned to be opened in different location was added. The proposed solution also facilitated mobile usage for more significant process improvements. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","call center; customer relationship management; customer service; web","Artificial intelligence; Information systems; Public relations; Sales; Web services; Call centers; Customer preferences; Customer relationship management; Customer services; Process Improvement; Sanitary ware; Service Quality; web; Customer satisfaction",,,,,"Lis, T., Customer Relationship Management of Logistics Company (2011) Manuf Ind Eng., 10 (4), pp. 40-43; Agarwal, S., Singh, D., Thakur, K.S., Performance indicators and customer satisfaction: With special reference to selected call centers of India (2013) Int J Arts Commer., 2 (2), pp. 13-26; Krawczyk-Sokołowska, I., Ziołkowska, B., Computer-Aided and Web-Based Tools in Customer Relationship Management (2013) Acta Electrotech Inform [Internet], 13 (4), pp. 13-19; Malisuwan, S., Madan, N., Kaewphanuekrungsi, W., Petchinda, N., Adoption of New Information Economics for Informational System Development in Modern Day Call Center.

The program differs from the regular face to face program since it is dominated with online classes. The LMS was designed and implemented to provide the right solution. The LMS succeed to facilitate students and lecturers in obtaining academic information and learning process anytime, anywhere via the internet.

The development of this system is motivated due to the fact that the students' attendance records are one of the important elements that reflect their academic achievements. However, the current manual practice implemented is causing such a hassle. Empowering the usage of the new RFID based student card, a new web based-attendance system has been built to cater the recording and reporting of not just the student's' attendances, but also the lecturer's and taught topics in the class. The development of this system is inspired by the senior management. And the system can be easily accessed through the learning management system and can generate a report in real time, This paper will discuss in details the development until the maintaining phase of the system. Result achieved is the innovation of developing the system proved reliable to support related business processes and empowered the intention to maximize the usage of the RFID card. Considered as a successful implementation, this paper will give an input for others who want to implement a similar system. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,"(2013), http://web.binus.edu/binusiancard/About.BINUSIAN.Card-Flazz/English, Accessed 4 July; Caviglia Harris, J.L., Attendance and achievement in economics: Investigating the impact of attendance policies and absentee rates on student performance (2006) Journal of Economics and Finance Education, 4 (2); Lim, T.S., Sim, S.C., Mansor, M.M., Industrial electronic & applications (2009) IEEE Symposium on, 2, pp. 778-782; Tabassam, N., Pervaiz, S., Korrani, A., Azhar-Ud-Din, Development of academic attendance monitoring system using fingerprint identification (2009) International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, 9 (5), pp. 164-168; Balcoh, N.K., Yousaf, M.H., Ahmad, W., Baig, M.I., Algorithm for efficient attendance management: Face recognition based approach (2012) JCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, 9 (1-4); Hodges, S., McFarlane, D., (2005) Radio Frequency Identification: Technology, Application and Impact, , Whitepaper, AutoID Labs, Cambridge; Patel, R., Patel, N., Gajjar, M., Online students' attendance monitoring system in classroom using radio frequency identification technology: A proposed system framework (2012) International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering, 2 (2). , ISSN 2250-2459; Singhal, Z., Gujral, R.K., Anytime anywhere-remote monitoring of attendance system bcase on RFID using GSM network (2012) International Journal of Computer Applications, 39 (3). , 0975-8887; McFarlane, D., Sheffi, Y., The impact of automatic identification on supply chain operations (2003) The Int J Logist Manag, 1, pp. 14-17. , Doi: 10.1108/09574090310806503; (2003) The IT Revolution: The Best Thing since the Barcode, 51. , The Economist; Ustundag, A., Kilinc, M.S., Cevikcan, E., Fuzzy rule-based system for the economic analysis of RFID investments (2010) Expert Syst Appl, 37 (7), pp. 5300-5306. , doi: 10.1016/j.eswa.2010.01.009; Ustundag, A., (2013) The Value of RFID: Benefit Vs.

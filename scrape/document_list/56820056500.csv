The quantitative study was conducted with convenience sampling to 54 respondents (92% return rate). The questionnaire included items to measure the attitude toward generosity, intention to participate in the CRM program and positive emotion. All data were analyzed using SmartPLS. The finding of the study is that there is a significant positive relationship between generosity to positive emotion and a significant positive relationship between positive emotion and intention to participate in the CRM program. However, the direct relationship between attitude and generosity to the intention to participate in the CRM program is not significant. This study has both theoretical and practical implications. The contribution to theoretical is that this study gives empirical evidence of the relationship between generosity and intention. The practical implication is that this study can give insight to the manager on how to use CRM to improve company relationships with customers. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

Studies show that innovation is one of key factor for firms’ survival, success and sustainable competitive advantages. Leadership is reported to be one of the most important predictors of innovation. Transformational Leadership style is considered as the most suitable type of leadership which can influence innovation. However, the impact of transformational leadership to innovation is not consistent. Recognizing that innovation is a complex concept which requires to both explore and exploit in a non-linear sequence, therefore it is not enough for leader to have only one specific leadership style. Ambidextrous leadership style, which has both opening and closing leadership behaviours, is considered to be more effective in the work of innovation. This study aims to provide further empirical evidence of the link between ambidextrous leadership style with team creativity and innovation as well as relationship between team creativity and team innovation and how team innovation influences team performance. Quantitative descriptive study was conducted to 144 senior staff and managers from various industry in several cities in Indonesia. Structured questionnaire was designed for respondent to rate their leaders leadership style, team creativity, team innovation and team performance. Data was analysed was using SEM-AMOS. The result of the study showed that there were positive links between ambidextrous leadership to team creativity and to team innovation. Positive relationship was also confirmed between team creativity and team innovation. This study also confirm the influence of team innovation to team performance. This study contribute to ambidextrous leadership theory as well as leadership to innovation literature, especially in Indonesia context. The managerial contribution is giving insight to organization how important for leader to be able to explore and exploit in the work of innovation. © 2020 SERSC.","Ambidextrous leadership; Leadership style; Team creativity; Team innovation",,,,,,"Leitner, K.-H., Warnke, P., Rhomberg, W., New forms of innovation: Critical issues for future pathways (2016) Foresight, 18 (3), pp. 224-237; Atalay, M., Anafarta, N., Sarvanc, F., The relationship between innovation and firm performance: An empirical evidence from Turkish automotive supplier industry (2013) Procedia-Soc.

Major research questions pursued were: What is the influence of entrepreneurial process on the green business environment concept? What is the influence of cost effectiveness of membrane-based technology of the water system on the green business environment concept? What is the influence of entrepreneurial process on the sustainable competitive advantage of a pharmaceutical firm? What is the influence of cost effectiveness of membrane-based technology in a water system on the sustainable competitive advantage in a pharmaceutical firm? What is the influence of a green business environment concept on sustainable competitive advantage for a pharmaceutical firm? The research was conducted from a sample of 206 pharmaceutical member-firms of the Indonesian Pharmaceutical Association (GP FARMASI). The result of this research verified that the entrepreneurial process has a significant positive influence on the green business environment and sustainable competitive advantage. Furthermore, cost effectiveness also has significant positive influence on green business environment but has no significant influence on sustainable competitive advantage. Therefore, cost effectiveness and the entrepreneurial process membrane-based technology was suggested as an effective strategy to create a green business environment and achieve sustainable competitive advantage in the pharmaceutical industry. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt.

The influence of information technology (IT) also has impacted the way firms do business, not only improving process efficiency, but also data analyses, decision-making, customer acquisition and retention which lead to the improvement of organization sustainability. However, the implementation of new technology is not easy. Various studies have shown failure in the technology implementation. Based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the quality of the system, which consists of perceived usefulness (POU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU), has been understood to influence customer satisfaction. However, there are still few studies that link system quality and customer loyalty. This study aimed to see the influence of system quality on customer loyalty. Using a descriptive quantitative method, this study was conducted on BPJS Kesehatan (Universal Health Coverage Program in Indonesia) members at 19 public and private hospitals in nine cities in Java, Indonesia. A six-point Likert scale questionnaire was designed and distributed. Four hundred and six samples collected were eligible for analysis using descriptive analysis and structural equation modelling with LISREL. The results show there is a positive relationship between system quality and customer loyalty. This study strengthens the body of evidence which showed the influence of POU and PEOU on customer loyalty. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Customer loyalty; Perceived ease of use; Perceived of usefulness; TAM",,,,,,"Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., Attitude-Behavior Relations: A Theoretical Analysis and Review of Empirical Research (1977) Psychological Bulletin, 84 (5), pp. 888-918. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.84.5.888; Calisir, F., Altin Gumussoy, C., Bayraktaroglu, A.E., Karaali, D., Predicting the intention to use a web-based learning system: Perceived content quality, anxiety, perceived system quality, image, and the technology acceptance model (2014) Human Factors and Ergonomics In Manufacturing, 24 (5), pp. 515-531. , https://doi.org/10.1002/hfm.20548; Calisir, F., Gumussoy, C.A., Bayraktaroglu, A.E., Karaali, D., Predicting the Intention to Use a Web-Based Learning System: Perceived Content Quality, Anxiety, Perceived System Quality, Image, and the Technology Acceptance Model Fethi (2014) Human Factors and Ergonomics In Manufacturing & Service Industries, 24 (5), pp. 515-531. , https://doi.org/10.1002/hfm; Davis, F.D., Bagozzi, R.P., Warshaw, P.R., User Acceptance of Computer Technology: A Comparison of Two Theoretical Models (1989) Management Science, 35 (8), pp. 982-1003. , https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.35.8.982; Hsu, L.-C., Influence of Quality of Information System Success (ISS) on Customer Intention to Continue Use in B2B E-commerce: A Contingency Approach of System Anxiety (2014) Research Journal of Business Management, 8, pp. 353-366. , https://doi.org/10.3923/rjbm.2014.353.366; Kim, J., Jin, B., Swinney, J.L., The role of etail quality, e-satisfaction and e-trust in online loyalty development process development process (2009) Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 16, pp. 239-247. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretconser.2008.11.019; Kim, M., Vogt, C.A., Knutson, B.J., Relationship among Customer Sayisfaction (2015) Delight and Loyalty In the Hospitality Industry, 39 (2), pp. 170-197. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1096348012471376; Lee, D., Moon, J., Jin, Y., Yi, M.Y., Information & Management Antecedents and consequences of mobile phone usability: Linking simplicity and interactivity to satisfaction, trust, and brand loyalty (2015) Information & Management, 52 (3), pp. 295-304. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.im.2014.12.001; Liaw, S.S., Investigating students' perceived satisfaction, behavioral intention, and effectiveness of e-learning: A case study of the Blackboard system (2008) Computers and Education, 51 (2), pp. 864-873. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2007.09.005; Lovelock, C., Wirtz, J., Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy (2011) Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy, , https://doi.org/10.1044/1059-0889(2011/10-0028; Navimipour, N.J., Soltani, Z., (2016) The Impact of Cost, Technoloy Acceptance and Employees' Satisfaction On the Effectiveness of the Electronic Customer Relationship Management System, 55. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2015.10.036; Oliver, R.L., (2015) Satisfaction a Behavioral Perspective On Consumer, , 2nd ed.).

Especially in Indonesia's telecommunications industry, there is a change in the use of telecommunications services with a greater need to provide innovative data services. This research aimed to investigate the relationship among transformational leadership, innovative work behavior, performance, and digital literacy (as a moderator of the relationship between innovative work behavior and performance). This illustrates how innovation in technology can serve as a core element to drive the competitiveness of a company, especially in high-tech industries. The role of innovation is becoming increasingly significant and can determine the survival and growth of a company. This study surveyed 230 managerial-level and above employees from three telecommunication companies in Indonesia. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed with LISREL to analyze the data in this quantitative research. The results showed that there was a significant and positive relationship between transformational leadership and innovative work behavior, innovative work behavior was also significantly and positively related to performance, and digital literacy significantly moderated the relationship between innovative work behavior and performance. © IJTech 2019.","Digital literacy; Innovative work behavior; Strategic management; Telecommunication industry; Transformational leadership",,,,,,"Abstein, A., Heidenreich, S., Spieth, P., Innovative Work Behaviour: The Impact of Comprehensive HR System Perceptions and the Role of Work-life Conflict (2014) Industry and Innovation, 21, pp. 91-116; Ahmed, H.M.S., Hybrid E-learning Acceptance Model: Learner Perceptions (2010) Decision Sciences Journal of Innovative Education, 8 (2), pp. 313-346; (2019) Laporan Survei Penetrasi & Profil Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia, , 2018 (Penetration Survey Report & Indonesian Internet User Behavior Profile 2018); Avolio, B.J., Bass, B.M., Individual Consideration Viewed at Multiple Levels of Analysis: A Multi-level Framework for Examining the Diffusion of Transformational Leadership (1995) The Leadership Quarterly, 6 (2), pp. 199-218; Avolio, B.J., Bass, B.M., (2004) MLQ-Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, , Menlo Park, CA: Mind Garden; Bass, B.M., (1985) Leadership and Performance Beyond Expectations, , New York, NY: Free Press; Berawi, M.A., Stimulating Innovation and Creativity: The Way Forward (2017) International Journal of Technology, 8 (1), pp. 1-4; Chang, J., Bai, X., Juan, J., The Influence of Leadership on Product and Process Innovations in China: The Contingent Role of Knowledge Acquisition Capability (2015) Industrial Marketing Management, 50, pp. 18-29; Chen, J., Leung, W.S., Evans, K.P., Are Employee-friendly Workplaces Conducive to Innovation?

The money involves in charitable giving is a huge. Business has tapping into this opportunity with program such as Cause Related Marketing (CRM). Firms introduced as approach to combine act of giving & business purpose so that customers view purchasing as a prosocial behavior. Currently there is still limited measures available to assess generosity construct, especially in Indonesia. Two quantitative studies to review the validity and reliability of two type generosity measures were conducted, pilot study which involves 42 samples and extension study which involves 200 samples. Structured questionnaires which distributed online was used as instrutment of the studies. The result of data analysis with SPSS shows that Buhrow’s Generosity scale is valid but not reliable in both pilot and extension studies. However, IG Scale from Smith and Hill is reliable and valid. Reviewing the items of both scales reveals that some items in Buhrow’s scale were not common term and common practice in Indonesia. Therefore, culture fit context should be an important consideration in choosing generosity scale. IG Scale from Smith and Hill is suitable to measure generosity in Indonesia. © 2019 SERSC.","Generosity; Reliability; Scale; Validity",,,,,,"Aronson, S.E., Wilson, T.D., Sommers, S.R., (2015) Prosocial Behavior: Why Do People Help, pp. 357-380. , Social Psychology (9th ed., Pearson; Buhrow, W.C., Bufford, R., Webb, K., (2010) Preliminary Validation of a Measure of Generosity, pp. 1-2. , Digital Commons @George Fox University; Collett, J.L., Morrissey, C.A., The Social Psychology of Generosity: The State of Current Interdisciplinary Research (2007) Report for the John Templeton Foundation Generosity Planning Project.–45 P, 15 (2001), pp. 2008-2009; Corcoran, K.E., Thinkers and feelers: Emotion and giving (2015) Social Science Research, 52, pp. 686-700. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2014.10.008; Dwidienawati, D., Abdinagoro, S.B., Does Generosity Influence Intention to Continue Paying Insurance Premium?

The sudden increase in demand will disrupt the delivery of service, especially in public hospitals, which will influence service satisfaction levels. A preliminary study shows that satisfaction levels of BPJS Kesehatan patients are still low. The most frequent reasons cited for dissatisfaction are fairness issues such as different treatments and different processes and procedures. Studies have found that aside from evaluations of quality, fairness is indeed an important factor that influences satisfaction. Yet there are limited empirical researches on the effect of service fairness on service delivery, especially in the healthcare industry. This study addresses the question of whether there are direct relationships between three variables of fairness and customer satisfaction. In other words, are there different levels of perceived service fairness in private and public hospitals and, if so, does this have an impact on customer satisfaction? Using a descriptive quantitative method, this study was conducted on BPJS Kesehatan members who used 19 public and private hospitals in nine cities in Java, Indonesia. A six-point Likert scale questionnaire was designed and distributed. Four hundred and six samples collected were eligible for analysis using descriptive analysis and structural equation modelling using LISREL. The results show that there is a positive impact of the three variables regarding service fairness on customer satisfaction in public and private hospitals. However, the relationship between distributive fairness and customer satisfaction is not significant in public hospitals. This study strengthens the building evidence that service fairness, in addition to service quality, influences customer satisfaction, specifically in service delivery in the healthcare industry. © BEIESP.","BPJS Kesehatan; Private Hospitals; Public Hospitals; Satisfaction",,,,,,"Bredenkamp, C., Evans, T., Lagrada, L., Langenbrunner, J., Nachuk, S., Palu, T., Emerging challenges in implementing universal health coverage in Asia (2015) Soc Sci Med, 145, pp. 243-248; Thabrany, H., Raja Grafindo Persada (2016) Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional, 3, pp. 1-295; Dwidienawati, D., Abdinagoro, S.B., Does Generosity Influence Intention to Continue Paying Insurance Premium?

The rapid expansion of health insurance coverage has created demand which cannot be met by current healthcare system and will disrupt the delivery service (Bredenkamp et al., 2015). The disruption of service, as a consequence, will influence the satisfaction. Patient satisfaction evaluation is important because it is not only as an important indicator to evaluate the achievement of the program but also it is important to improve treatment outcome. At present there is limited report on patients’ satisfaction to BPJS Kesehatan provider. This study is aiming to find out the satisfaction level of BPJS Kesehatan in Indonesia after 3 years of program implementation. This study using questionnaires as survey instruments. Aiming to BPJS Kesehatan midair that pays monthly payment insurance in six hospitals in five big cities in Indonesia. Three hundred and twenty-eight questionnaires are eligible to be analyzed. Decsriptive analyzed is done to evaluate the satisfaction rate. The result of the study shows that patients are satisfy with the interaction, support and services provided by BPJS Kesehatan patients, which is ninety-four per cent satisfaction. This study result is different with the pervious study which shows lower satisfaction rate. The explanation is that in this study majority of respondents come from private hospitals which known to have better service compares to public hospitals. To confirm the result of the study, further study which involved more balance public and private hospitals and big cities and small cities should be done to compare the satisfaction rate from each type of hospitals and cities. Further study to identify which variable of satisfactions are more influencing is also needed to identify are of improvement of BPJS Kesehatan services. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

However, several literatures had acknowledged that this condition was the result of an abnormal internal condition, where firms competed not to engage in competitive selling activities but rather as an effort to maintain performance. This paper was written and prepared as part of a recent study in the Indonesian lighting industry, where many players in the industry considered themselves caught in a severe price war condition. Based on a qualitative survey using open-ended interviews of seven lighting companies in Indonesia, the study found that the industry regard price wars as the result of severe intra-brand competition and an effort to maintain the “status quo” of continuous growth. Propositions to ease friction in price were suggested: exploration to other market segments; exploiting information to induce loyalty; understanding rivalry through capacity size; and management of short-term performance constraints. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Internal firm condition; Lighting industry; Price Wars",,,,,,"Barney, J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Composite Materials, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Bhattacharya, R.R., (1999) Short-Run Constraints and Price Wars, , Sydney, Australia; Bungert, M., (2003) Termination of Price Wars: A Signaling Approach, , Wiesbaden: Deutscher Universitäts-Verlag; Busse, M., Firm financial condition and airline price wars (2000) The RAND Journal of Economics, 33 (2), pp. 298-318; Caves, R.E., Porter, M.E., From entry barriers to mobility barriers: Conjectural decisions and contrived deterrence to new competition (1977) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 91 (2), pp. 241-261; Ciriminna, R., Albanese, L., Meneguzzo, F., Pagliaro, M., LED street lighting: A looking ahead perspective (2015) Green, 5 (1-6), pp. 83-94; Deneckere, R., Kovenock, D., Price leadership (1992) The Review of Economic Studies, 59 (1), pp. 143-162; Deneckere, R., Kovenock, D., Lee, R., A model of price leadership based on consumer loyalty (1992) The Journal of Industrial Economics, 40 (2), pp. 147-156; Diallo, M.F., Coutelle-Brillet, P., Riviere, A., Zielke, S., How do price perceptions of different brand types affect shopping value and store loyalty?

The split incentive problem identified in Indonesia shows that the currently designed program of incentives is still problematic for both providers and customers. This suggests that there are multiple alternatives to the incentives that are more suitable to assist in energy-efficiency implementation. Using case studies on retrofit financing for LED lamps in Indonesia, this study aimed to test the validity of those issues, which involved the process of energy decision-making within an organization. Triangulating the findings from case studies and questionnaire surveys, recommendations for future researchers, practitioners, and the government were made. The results indicated that retrofit financing in Indonesia is feasible. Financial metrics such as the analysis of discounted payback period, IRR, and NPV were used to further validate the result. The study also identified that the provider can use Game Theory as a tool to analyze the costs and benefits of retrofit business decisions to tackle the split incentive problems. These findings could lead to improvement in strategies in considering the effectiveness of a firm’s policy measures for delivering energy efficiency in the future. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","ESA & ESPC; Game theory; LCC; Retrofit; Split incentive problem",,,,,,"Allcott, H., Greenstone, M., Is there an energy efficiency gap?

As of today, 383 of Regional Government Water Supply Companies in Indonesia, known as Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum (PDAM), are underperforming with only 36% of urban service coverage or 22,40% of national service coverage in average. This paper aims at examining the effect of the latent variables of strategic entrepreneurship, dynamic capabilities, and government policies to PDAM performance. The novelty of this research is the role of government policy as a moderating variable in the relationship between strategic entrepreneurship and dynamic capabilities as they relate to PDAM performance. The methodology used in this research is the quantitative method conducted through a descriptive and explanatory survey. The number of the sample is 120 respondents. Further data were analyzed using the SEM-PLS method with SmartPLS software. This research proved that dynamic capabilities influence PDAM performance, and indicate the need for a stronger government policy, one that would influence strategic entrepreneurship and dynamic capabilities relate to PDAM performance. These findings are intended to contribute to development of strategic management theory and a managerial implication, specifically that PDAM should apply strategic management for the improvement of their performance in order to actively participate in government programs for drinking water services. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

The current technology advancements empower companies to produce creativity and innovation to serve customer needs and expectation. To deliver this challenge, it requires the continuous breakthrough and innovation. To create organization innovation, employee plays the main key, as the main source and the executor of innovation. The organizational environment in knowledge-based industries, especially in the telecommunication industry, it is very dynamic and work activities tend to involve non-standard tasks and complicated non-routines. Routines carried out by organizations may not be able to respond quickly to rapid technological changes, or often experience technical problems that require fast and creative solutions. This study, focused on the innovative work behavior on employee perspective (creative self-efficacy and transformational leadership) and tested the digital literacy role on moderating the relationship between innovative work and employee performance. This study was made based on the survey conducted at various telecommunication companies across Indonesia comprising of 235 participants with managerial level and above. Structural equation modeling (LISREL) was used for data analysis in this quantitative research. The result proved that there was a positive and significant relationship between creative self-efficacy, transformational leadership and innovative work behavior, innovative work behavior was positively related to performance, digital literacy gave significant moderating influences on the relationship between innovative work behavior and performance. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Creative Self-Efficacy; Digital Literacy; Innovative Work Behavior; Strategic Management; Telecommunication Industry; Transformational Leadership",,,,,,"Avolio, B.J., Bass, B.M., Individual consideration viewed at multiple levels of analysis: A multi-level framework for examining the diffusion of transformational leadership (1995) The Leadership Quarterly, 6 (2), pp. 199-218; Avolio, B.J., Bass, B.M., (2004) MLQ—Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, p. 2004. , Menlo Park, CA: Mind Garden; Bass, B.M., (1985) Leadership and Performance beyond Expectations, , Collier Macmillan; Chang, J., Bai, X., Li, J.J., The influence of leadership on product and process innovations in China: The contingent role of knowledge acquisition capability (2015) Industrial Marketing Management, 50, pp. 18-29; Chen, M.H., Chang, Y.Y., Chang, Y.C., Exploring individual-work context fit in affecting employee creativity in technology-based companies (2015) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 98, pp. 1-12; Chiang, Y.H., Hsu, C.C., Hung, K.P., Core self-evaluation and workplace creativity (2014) Journal of Business Research, 67 (7), pp. 1405-1413; Choi, S.B., Kim, K., Ullah, S.E., Kang, S.W., How transformational leadership facilitates innovative behavior of Korean workers: Examining mediating and moderating processes (2016) Personnel Review, 45 (3), pp. 459-479; Craig, J.T., (2015) Antecedents of Individual Innovative Behavior: Examining Transformational Leadership, Creative Climate, Role Ambiguity, Risk Propensity, and Psychological Empowerment, , Alliant International University; de Jong, J., Den Hartog, D., Measuring innovative work behaviour (2010) Creativity and Innovation Management, 19 (1), pp. 23-36; Dörner, N., (2012) Innovative Work Behavior: The Roles of Employee Expectations and Effects on Job Performance, , [Doctoral Thesis, University of St. Gallen 120 ps.

There are limited previous empiric researches studied on the effect of social technology adoption towards ambidexterity. We hypothesize that social technology adoption can lead to ambidexterity directly and through rapid absorptive capacity and collectivism-based collaboration. Using quantitative method, this research was conducted to organizations that adopt social technology in various sectors in Indonesia. Data was processed by structural equation modeling (SEM). This research shows that ambidexterity positively affects organizational performance. It also shows that social technology adoption positively affects ambidexterity directly and through rapid absorptive capacity. However, this research does not support the hypothesis that social technology adoption will positively affect ambidexterity through collectivism-based collaboration. This research may give benefits to strategic management literature in finding the robust model to build an ambidextrous organization, especially through social technology adoption. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Absorptive capacity; Organizational ambidexterity; Organizational performance; Social technology",,,,,,"Andriopoulos, C., Lewis, M.W., Exploitation-exploration tensions and organizational ambidexterity: managing paradoxes of innovation (2009) Organization Science, 20 (4), pp. 696-717; Ashurst, C., Freer, A., Ekdahl, J., Gibbons, C., Exploring IT-enabled innovation: a new paradigm?

The Internet has also fundamentally changed the paradigm of today's business communications, altered the way in which information is shared, and set an enormous influence on marketing strategy. There are prior studies on the relationship between leadership type and new technology adoption, as well as dynamic capability and new technology adoption. Most of these studies have confirmed that there is a significant correlation between both transformational and dynamic capabilities to new technology adoption, of which most emphasized the adoption of the Internet or e-commerce. While previous studies have confirmed the relationship amongst those variables, this paper investigates empirically in one cohesive research model on the relationship between transformational leadership and digital marketing adoption, dynamic capability and digital marketing adoption, and dynamic capability as a mediating variable on the relationship between transformational leadership and digital marketing adoption. Furthermore, this research uniquely studies consumer shopping goods in the context of Indonesia. The survey was undertaken in Greater Jakarta, Indonesia, with 215 firms in the field of consumer shopping goods. The outcome reveals that there is a direct impact of dynamic capability to digital marketing adoption, but to the contrary, there is an indirect impact between transformational leadership and digital marketing adoption. This study also finds that the relationship between transformational leadership and digital marketing adoption is fully mediated by the dynamic capability of the firms. © 2017 Universita Putra Malaysia.","Digital marketing; Dynamic capability; Technology acceptance; Transformational leadership",,,,,,"Al-Qirim, N., 'An Empirical Investigation of An E-Commerce Adoption-Capability Model in Small Businesses in New Zealand' (2005) Journal Routledge Electronic Markets, 15 (4), pp. 418-437; Amit, S., 'Strategic Asset and Organizational Rent' (1993) Strategic Management Journal, 14 (4), pp. 33-46. , Corporate Change, Vol. 3, No. 3, pp. 557-605. 22; Arthur, W.B., 'Increasing Returns and the New World of Business and the Two Worlds of Business' (1996) Harvard Business Review, pp. 1-10; Barlon, K., 'The concept of the marketing mix' (2006) Presentation on marketing management, vol, 1, pp. 2-7. , September, 2006-Oulu University-Finland; Barreto, I., 'Dynamic Capabilities: A Review of Past Research and an Agenda for the Future' (2010) Journal of Management, 36 (1), pp. 256-280; Bass, B.M., (1985) 'Leadership and Performance Beyond Expectations', , New York: Free Press; Bass, B.M., Waldman, D.A., Avolio, B.J., Bebb, M., 'Transformational Leadership and the Falling Dominoes Effect' (1987) Group and Organization Studies, 12, pp. 73-78; Bass, B.M., Avolio, B.J., (1994) 'Improving organizational effectiveness through transformational leadership', , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Booms, B.H., Bitner, B.J., 'Marketing strategies and organization structures for service firms (1980) Marketing of services, pp. 47-51. , In Donnelly, J. & George W.

While strategic agility, indirectly, through business model innovation, impact firm performance. Based on the findings, it was recommended that ICT firms should continuously anticipate the business uncertainty as part of dynamic nature of the industry. In addition, ICT firms are encouraged to employ dynamic IT capability and be strategically agile by making efforts to deploy resources that can bring about business model innovation, and in turn firm performance. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

As an enterprise, co-operative is not immune to environmental changes. Therefore co-operative must be able to compete with other industries to reach the best performance in globalization era. The capability to cope with environmental pressure is known as dynamic capability. Research on the implementation of dynamic capabilities, however, only focus on conceptual discussions and empirical studies are still limited, especially in co-operatives. This research is proposed to fill the gap by conducting the empirical research, in order to examine the effect of dynamic capabilities for the formation of competitive advantage to achieve co-operatives’ performance in terms of economic and social performances. The result shows that dynamic capability could be implemented in Indonesian credit co-operatives to establish a competitive advantage and ultimately be used to achieve a better firm’s performances. However, dynamic capability cannot be used directly to achieve a better performance. The firms must choose the right and superior capability to compete with their competitors. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

The data were complemented by documentary analysis of strategic plans and articles on the industries organisation. Strategic perspectives highlighted the themes of effective organisational development (organisational capability): governance, people development, financial performance, operations, service delivery and external relations; and the dynamic capabilities framework of capability exploitation (extracting maximum economic returns from current resources) and capability exploration (development of new capabilities). The study suggests that environmental pressure moderates the relationship between dynamic capabilities, business strategy and business performance, this perspective provides the much needed theoretical rationale that can be an aid to management undertaking to build competitive industry organisations to increasing the business performance.

Information and Communication Technology firms do not always need to invest heavily in new capital expenditures to come out with new technology, products or services, but can consider adopting business model innovation, as a novel and efficient way, to gain competitive advantage. The dynamic nature of the Information and Communication Technology industry shortens the life cycles of services and products. Thus, in many cases heavy capital expenditures may not make financial return justifiable. Business model innovation, which initiates novel ways of performing activities, linking customers, suppliers and partners, and/or changing participants in the transactions, may become an alternate solution. Information and Communication Technology firms can maximize business model innovation to leapfrog ahead of competition as first mover in a of high growth opportunity zone. This study investigates the role of business model innovation in embracing changes in the dynamic business environment of the Information Communication Technology industry, leading to competitive sustainability and firm performance. Using Structural Equation Modeling, this study performs the Confirmatory Factor Analysis tests on the observed and latent variables of business model innovation and firm performance and examines the structural model defining the relationships between these two latent variables. The study concludes that business model innovation has positive and direct impact to firm performance, and attained its objectives of contributing a theory based on synthesis and empirical evidence to further understanding how business model innovation impacts firm performance. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

Understanding the creation, preservation and distribution of value is, therefore, essential for Management. This paper describes how Companies can enhance core values by creating growth and improving Return on Invested Capital through a merger. Merger establishes operational and financial synergies. Operational synergies improve profit, resulting from better pricing and purchasing powers. The blend of different strengths and the pooling of resources, allow merged Companies to enjoy higher margins. Financial synergies optimize capital structure due to sharing of financing resources and cheaper mean of financing. The merger drives revenue and asset growth from new, enlarged and extended markets. As part of the analysis, this paper also discusses the merger case of PT Kalbe Farma, Tbk and its group companies. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

Various antecedents of ambidexterity have been studied. Several literatures described social technology adoption as a factor that positively correlates with organizational ambidexterity. This is promising to be explored further in Indonesia, where social technology is widely adopted. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively examine the relationship between social technology adoption and organizational ambidexterity. The result supported the hypothesis (p < 0.01, r = 0.501, 1-tailed). Further examinations found that organization can gain a difference on organizational ambidexterity by adopting Twitter and or LinkedIn, but not Facebook. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

In this paper, the proposed methods are applied to a construction company in Indonesia, that is the fuzzy ELECTRE method is applied to cement vendors recommendation problem of PT Wijaya Karya. There are four vendors (A1,A2,A3 and A4) as a recommendation for the best vendor selection. The selection of vendors of raw materials is one of the activities in supply chain management at PT Wijaya Karya. The role of the vendor will contribute to determining the success of this company. After determining the criteria that affect the vendor selection decisions, the results for fuzzy ELECTRE methods are presented. © 2019 The Authors.

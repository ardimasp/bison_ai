This step will ensures yours developed system or software has high quality in functionality or non-functionality needs. Several methods can be used to evaluate the Augmented Reality application: subjective measurement using human perception or objective measure from observation, or evaluation by expert through cognitive walkthrough, heuristic evaluation, lab observation, and questionnaire. An evaluation is more valid if evaluation was done in multiple methods in order to confirm the result of evaluation. © 2017 IEEE.","expert evaluation; objective measurement; Subjective measurement","Augmented reality; Information management; Testing; Augmented reality applications; Cognitive walkthrough; Expert evaluation; Heuristic evaluation; Objective measure; Objective measurement; Subjective measurements; Usability testing methods; Heuristic methods",,,,,,"Fenton, N., Bieman, J., (2014) Software Metrics A Rigorous and Practical Approach, , 3rd ed.

It does not understand and capable of doing natural conversation with human. To build a system that can naturally understand and communicate with human, it is essential to train the system with natural conversation data. This paper proposes a dataset which consists of natural dyadic conversation in Indonesian language. Where literature suggested that there are exists inadequate number of conversation dataset in Indonesian Language. There are 3164 words (formal and slang (informal nonstandard words) annotated from the recording of five groups, with the largest number of words belong to Food topic (Group 3, 826 words), and the lowest one belongs to Travelling topic (Group 2, 372 words). The dataset contributes a pre-trained conversation model with deep learning (LSTM). The model is trained in 10000 iterations, 128 batches, and 4 hidden layers, resulted in a perplexity of 2.01. © 2018 The Author(s).","Corpus; Dyadic; Indonesian Datasets; LSTM; Natural Conversation","Deep learning; Corpus; Dyadic; Indonesians; LSTM; Natural Conversation; Long short-term memory",,,,"Nvidia","We gratefully acknowledge the support of NVIDIA Corporation with the donation of the Titan X Pascal GPU used for this research, and the support of BINUS University Grant 2017 to support the operational for this research.","Chowanda, A., Flintham, M., Blanchfield, P., Valstar, M., Playing with social and emotional game companions (2016) International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents, pp. 85-95. , Springer; Chowanda, A., Blanchfield, P., Flintham, M., Valstar, M., Computational models of emotion, personality, and social relationships for interactions in games (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Autonomous Agents & Multiagent Systems.

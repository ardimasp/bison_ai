The challenging part of food image recognition is to recognize a food image with different background, intensity, and perspective. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) seems to be the right choice to build a powerful model that able to recognize food image accurately. Current researches in food recognition use American fast food and Japanese food as the dataset. Different dataset has different treatment to obtain good result. Color and presentation has important role as features. Therefore, this research proposes to recognize five kinds of popular Indonesian food such as meatball (bakso), grilled chicken (ayam bakar), satay (sate), gado-gado (mixed vegetables with peanut sauce), and rendang using Convolutional Neural Network approach. Convolutional Neural Network with standard architecture and inception-v4 model are chosen as techniques with Adam as the optimizer function. Experimental results show the implementation of CNN for image recognition can achieve the top-1 testing accuracy around 76.3% for standard network and 95.2% for inception-v4 network. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,"Convolution; Neural networks; Convolutional neural network; Different treatments; Food image; Health industry; Japanese foods; Optimizers; Standard architecture; Testing accuracy; Image recognition",,,,"Binus University","The authors thank to Bina Nusantara University for the research grant and supporting this research.","Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L., ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database (2009) IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2009, pp. 248-255; Hinton, G.E., Srivastava, N., Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Salakhutdinov, R.R., (2012) Improving Neural Networks by Preventing Co-Adaptation of Feature Detectors, , arXiv preprint arXiv; Ioffe, S., Szegedy, C., (2015) Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift, , arXiv preprint arXiv; Kagaya, H., Aizawa, K., Ogawa, M., Food detection and recognition using convolutional neural network (2014) Proceedings of the 22Nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 1085-1088. , pp., ACM; Kawano, Y., Yanai, K., Real-time mobile food recognition system (2013) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pp. 1-7. , pp; Kingma, D.P., Ba, J., (2014) Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization, , arXiv preprint arXiv; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1097-1105. , pp; Lecun, Y., Boser, B.E., Denker, J.S., Henderson, D., Howard, R.E., Hubbard, W.E., Jackel, L.D., Handwritten digit recognition with a back-propagation network (1990) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 396-404. , pp; Nair, V., Hinton, G.E., Rectified linear units improve restricted boltzmann machines (2010) In: Proceedings of the 27Th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML; Pan, S.J., Yang, Q., A survey on transfer learning (2010) IEEE Trans.

This research are developed since it becomes common habit to take a picture in any activities, for instances before having a meal. Capturing image of meal allows to extract information which contain in food for health reference. The challenge in food recognition that these objects have various shape and appearances, especially Indonesian food, which may have different character for same type of food based on origin of foods. This research proposes a technique in food recognition, especially Indonesian food, using SIFT and machine learning techniques. K-Dimensional Tree (K-D Tree) and Backpropagation Neural network (BPNN) are chosen as machine learning techniques to recognize three types of Indonesian food namely Bakso, Ayam bakar and Sate. Experimental results shows BPNN has higher accuracy compare to K-D Tree which is 51% and 44% for BPNN and K-D Tree respectively. © 2017 The Authors.

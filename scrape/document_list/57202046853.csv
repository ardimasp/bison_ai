There are many new mobile applications with high user feedback but few download rates. Moreover, some users of the application are unwilling to give their feedbacks. This abrupt state is caused by the carelessness of mobile application developers in noticing the importance of user feedback and user behavior. In this paper, we will state several steps and options that could be taken by mobile application developers to popularize their mobile application. This solution is mainly focused on the utilization of user feedback and user behavior, which also include proper use of feedback loop, great advertising, and behavioral change. The objectives of this analysis are to change unpopular mobile applications with high user feedback to become popular mobile application with high user download rate, as well as to encourage users to properly express their opinion regarding the application by giving out their feedback to the mobile application developers. © 2017 IEEE.","Behavioral Change; Download Rate; Feedback Loop; Mobile Application; User Behavior; User Feedbacks","Artificial intelligence; Feedback; Internet of things; Mobile computing; Behavioral changes; Feed-back loop; Mobile applications; User behaviors; User feedback; Behavioral research",,,,,"Islam, R., Islam, R., Mazumder, T.A., Mobile application and its global impact (2010) International Journal of Engineering & Technology, 10 (6), pp. 72-78; (2015) Mobile Medical Application: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, , U.S. Department of Health Human Services Food and drug Administration, Rockville, MD, USA, February; Holzer, A., Ondrus, J., Mobile application market: A developer's perspective (2011) Telematics and Informatics, 28 (1), pp. 22-31; Adrian, D., Tarigan, R.E., The effect of revenue and market segmentation level towards venture capital investment in mobile application business (2014) International Journal of Communication & Information Technology (CommIT), 8 (1), pp. 10-16. , May; Cheng, J., Mizli, C.D.N., Leskovec, J., How community feedback shapes user behaviour (2014) Proceedings of the 8th International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, , 1-4 June; Hattie, J., Timperley, H., The power of feedback (2007) Review of Educational Research, 77 (1), pp. 81-112. , March; Renaud, K., Cooper, R., Feedback in human computer interaction-characteristic and reccomendation (2000) South African Journal, 2000 (26), pp. 105-114. , Nov; Brookhart, S.M., (2008) How to Give Effective Feedback to Your Student. 2nd Ed, , Virginia, USA, Association for Supervision and CurriculumDevelopment (ASCD); Storey, J., (2015) Cultural Theory and Popular Culture, 7th Ed, , New York, USA, Routledge; Astrom, K.J., Murray, R.M., (2008) Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers, , New Jersey, USA.

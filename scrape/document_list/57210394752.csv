With 300 respondents from students of private school in Indonesia and using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method, the study was conducted by combining the extended Technology Acceptance Model (e-TAM) and Information System Success (ISS) models. The results showed that self efficacy, personal innovativeness, subjective norms, relative advantages and accessibility systems had a significant positive effect on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use give a significant positive effect on the behavioral intention of students to use mobile LMS. Students’ behavioral intention has a significant positive effect on learning satisfaction and learning achievement perceived by students. The findings of this study present an understanding of the use of mobile LMS by students in senior secondary education. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Information System Success Model; Learning Achievement; Learning Satisfaction; Mobile Learning Management System; Technology Acceptance Model",,,,,,"Shin, W.S., Kang, M., The use of a mobile learning management system at an online university and its effect on learning satisfaction and achievement (2015) Int.

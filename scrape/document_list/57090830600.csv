Tetrasa Geosinindo, Indonesia","This paper presents three case histories on retaining earth structure failures in Indonesia and how to remedy it. The triggering problem will be analyzed and discussed. Finally, design procedure and its remedial structure of reinforced slope using geosynthetic are discussed and simple guidelines are proposed with a selection of geosynthetic reinforcement types and system. The first case is on a river side slope, located in Bali. A retaining earth structure of 12 m height was constructed using soldier piles. During the rainy season, the river in front of structure flooded and increased the pore water pressure behind it. The rapid draw down process of river water then collapsed the soldier pile structure. A solution combining high strength composite geotextile reinforcement and gabion facing was chosen and successfully executed. The second case is also on a river side slope, located in South Sumatra. The previous structure was sheetpile. After a while, the sheetpiles were pushed before filling work was even carried out. A solution using polyester geogrid was analyzed and proposed. The geogrid elements were installed behind the existing sheetpile without removing them and/or change to geogrid reinforced gabion. The remedial work was successful and this system was applied to solve other problems of similar nature in the same project. The third case is on a cutting slope, located in West Java. The existing area is almost flat with a 20m height difference to the surrounding area and consists of expansive soil and/or clay shale. For development purposes, the area was then cut leaving 10m slope to be strengthened by woven PP geotextile. Unfortunately, several weeks after the project completion, it failed. A proposed solution using the same material is submitted by considering several additional technical aspects. Based on the studies, it is concluded that retaining earth structures can be done with several different materials and approaches as long as they are applied in the right conditions bearing in mind the different influential factor involved.","Composite geotextile; Failure; Geogrid; Retaining earth structure; Woven PP geotextile","Computer system recovery; Geotextiles; Piles; Reinforcement; Rivers; Soils; Water resources; Weaving; Earth structures; Geogrids; Geosynthetic reinforcement; Geotextile reinforcement; High-strength composites; Influential factors; Pore-water pressures; Project completion; Geosynthetic materials",,,,,,"(1995) Code of Practice of Strengthened/reinforced Soils and Other Fills, , British Standard, BS 8006; (2008) Earth Retaining Structures, , FHWA Publication No. FHWA-NHI-07-071; Koerner, R.M., (2005) Designing with Geosynthetic, 5th Edition, , Prentice Hall; Plax is B.V., Manual of Plaxis; (2010) Chapter 18 - Earth Retaining Structures",,"Gottardi G.Cazzuffi D.Ling H.I.Han J.Tatsuoka F.","ACE Geosynthetics;ADAMA Engineering;Allan Block;Callide Technologies, Inc;et al.;Huesker Synthetic GmbH","DEStech Publications Inc.","International Symposium on Design and Practice of Geosynthetic-Reinforced Soil Structures and Joint Sessions with 26th Italian National Conference on Geosynthetics","14 October 2013 through 16 October 2013",,116700,,9781605951089,,,"English","Des.

However, the spread of news in online media is not all true (hoax). The problems faced by internet users of hoax news can be solved through pattern recognition. Research data was conducted of 2,000 Indonesian news, 1,000 for non-hoax news, and 1,000 for hoax news. Data was collected from Indonesian online news portals by crawling text methods. The research model was built using CRISP-DM methodology. The results showed that as high as 96,01% accuracy can be achieved using Support Vector Machine. Based on these results, it can be concluded that this modeling can be used to support the detection of hoax news in Indonesia today. It is hoped that this model can also be applied to help the government filter news that will be distributed to the people of Indonesia. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

However, when multiple tags transmit their IDs simultaneously, their signals collide, thereby prolonging the identification delay. However, in some applications, the RFID system has the availability of a database containing the IDs of all the tags that may possibly appear. The present study proposes a novel knowledge-based Query Tree with Shortcutting and Couple Resolution (QTSC) protocol for reducing the identification delay in RFID systems with such a database. In the proposed protocol, a knowledge-based query tree is first constructed to store the queries required to identify all the possible tags in the database. Then, at identifying appearing tags, the tags actually appear among possible tags, shortcutting and couple-resolution techniques are employed to skip redundant queries in the query tree and transmit two ID prefixes simultaneously within the same slot, respectively. The simulation results show that compared to the existing knowledge-based protocols, Knowledge Query Tree (KQT) and Heuristic Query Tree (HQT) protocols, QTSC reduces the identification delay by 60.5% and 39.0%, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anti-collision protocol; Knowledge-based query tree; RFID; Tag identification","Forestry; Knowledge based systems; Query languages; Query processing; Radio systems; Trees (mathematics); Knowledge based; Query tree; Resolution techniques; RF-ID tags; RFID systems; Wireless channel; Radio frequency identification (RFID)",,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST","The authors would like to thank Ministry of Science and Technology of Republic of China, Taiwan , for financially supporting this research under Contract No. MOST 108-2218-E-011-021 and MOST 108-2221-E-011-059-MY3 .","Namboodiri, V., DeSilva, M., Deegala, K., Ramamoorthy, S., A framework for enhancing the performance of internet of things applications based on RFID and WSNs (2018) J.

Most people do not realize they have heart disease until it is too late. Some parameters can be used to predict it, such as chest pain type, age, sex; fasting blood sugar; maximum heart rate. In this paper, using Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), a prediction of heart disease classification is presented. The results show that our proposed data mining technique using Naive Bayes can predict as high as 86% accuracy outperforming the previous works. Besides, Naïve Bayes is the best model in this study since it has the best values in terms of precision, accuracy, and specificity compared to other models. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The transformation of the mobile banking application into a digital banking application conducted by banks has made users re-evaluate based on their preferences. This study presents the behavior of users of digital banking applications in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The hypothesis model is based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with additional factors of the social image, perceived risk and perceived trust adopted from Muñoz-Leiva et al. (2017). The methodology in this study includes data collection through questionnaires distributed online and data analysis using the Structural Equation Model. The results of this study illustrate that the perceived trust and perceived risk have a more dominant part in influencing user attitude and user intention to use digital banking. Meanwhile, social image, perceived ease-of-use and perceived usefulness are not significant in influencing user attitude and user intention to use digital banking. The implication of this research helps to determine the right communication and strategy so that more users with more benefits can utilize this digital banking application. © 2020.

The development of a transportation system is still very much needed, which must be based on a comprehensive analysis and systemic approach. The application of planning standards and implementation standards and transport regulations must be firm and indiscriminate. The integrated mass public transportation system must become essential to overwhelm the problems by implementing IoT. IoT opportunities are very extraordinary can be developed for the benefit to the community. Thus, it means promises a lucrative market share is beyond open to DKI Jakarta Province. The participation from all stakeholder is needed to support the development of smart transportation and encounter the agile challenges at DKI Jakarta as a smart city. Thus, in this study, an IoT-based Integrated Smart Transportation based in Jakarta is proposed.

Climate change increase extreme and uncertain weather for horticulture cultivation. Farmers frequently face frequent damage to crops and decreasing in quantity and quality of plants. The development of a monitoring system that can help farmers grow crops is a crucial issue. In this paper, a study for a system for monitoring the performance of indoor micro-climate horticulture is presented. An electronic sensors Internet-of-Things (IoT) board is implemented to monitor the cultivation process. The sensor reading is collected into a database. The database is also integrated with the Indonesian Meteorological Agency data which consists of weather data and daily at the cultivation location. For our future work, the collected data are expected to be used for training machine learning models for the development of intelligence automated indoor micro-climate horticulture. © 2019 The Authors.

However, a smartwatch as an extension of a smartphone experienced a different thing. This study aims to investigate the relationship between usability, brands, and prices towards the perspective of consumers in Indonesia on smartwatches. We surveyed 116 smartwatch users and interviewed ten of them to get a complete understanding of their perceptions. This study reveals that the usage of smartwatches is less significant in influencing consumer perceptions, while brands and prices are strongly influencing the perception of consumers who have used smartwatches. Besides, this study also revealed that most respondents chose the smartwatch brand based on its smartphone brand. Xiaomi smartwatches were more affordable than other brands.

When multiple tags transmit their IDs simultaneously, their signals collide, prolonging the identification delay. Currently, there are many anti-collision protocols and one important approach of them is Query Tree (QT) protocol. In general applications, an RFID system has a database, which owns all tag IDs that possibly appear. Thus, considering the case that the RFID system has this knowledge, we propose a Query Tree with Knowledge-based Splitting (QTKS) protocol. From the known database, QTKS constructs a knowledge-based query tree, which stores queries that can more quickly identify appearing tags, which belong to possible tags in the database. The simulation results show that QTKS significantly outperforms related previous work. Compared to QT, QTKS can reduce its identification delay by 52%. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Anti-collision protocol; Knowledge-based; RFID; Tag identification","Collision avoidance; Forestry; Image processing; Knowledge based systems; Query languages; Query processing; Radio systems; Trees (mathematics); Anti-collision protocols; General applications; Knowledge based; Query tree; RF-ID tags; RFID systems; Tag identification; Wireless channel; Radio frequency identification (RFID)",,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, MOST: 107-2218-E-011-012

However, when many connections coexist, the power-saving efficiency is barely satisfactory because the sleep windows of these connections do not overlap and the MS cannot enter sleep mode. Many previous studies tried to shift the sleep windows of some connections where the sleep window is a series of continuous frames. This paper proposes an Interleaved-Sleeping-Listening (ISL) scheduler, which overlaps discrete sleep frames, rather than sleep windows, of multiple connections to obtain a higher number of overlapped sleep frames. The simulation results show that ISL outperforms the previous work, Maximum Unavailability Interval (MUI). When two connections exist and the sleep ratio, the ratio of the sleep frames in a sleep cycle, for each connection is 0.5, ISL improves MUI by 37% on the ratio of unavailability and 15% on the power consumption. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Power saving; Sleep frame; Sleep window; Unavailability interval","Electric power utilization; Scheduling; Continuous frames; Mobile station; Multiple connections; Power savings; Sleep cycle; Sleep frame; Sleep windows; Unavailability interval; Sleep research",,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST","The authors would like to thank Ministry of Science and Technology of Republic of China, Taiwan, for financially supporting this research under Contract No. MOST 106-3114-E-011-003 and MOST 106-2221-E-011-013 .","Agiwal, M., Roy, A., Saxena, N., Next generation 5G wireless networks: a comprehensive survey (2016) IEEE Commun Surv Tutorials, 18, pp. 1617-1655; Mushtaq, M.S., Fowler, S., Mellouk, A., Power saving model for mobile device and virtual base station in the 5G era (2017) IEEE Int.

Accelerating tag identification is an important issue in RFID systems. A series of anti-collision protocols, adaptive binary splitting (ABS), single resolution blocking (SRB), and pair resolution blocking (PRB), has been proposed to solve this problem. However, these protocols still waste much time, since they do not consider the identification delay that is the total time for identifying all tags rather than the number of slots. Thus, this paper proposes a novel protocol, symbolic SRB (SSRB). SSRB inherits the essence of SRB/PRB that reserves the information of the last identification process and adopts the same blocking technique. SSRB further considers the identification delay to allow each recognized tag to respond with a symbolic response, which is a shorter message, instead of its complete ID. Considering different lengths of slots, SSRB further determines the optimal number of initial slots to minimize the identification delay. Also formal analysis of SSRB identification delay with considering different slot lengths is derived. The analytic models and simulation results show that SSRB obtains superior performance than ABS, SRB, and PRB. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anti-collision; Blocking; RFID; Tag identification","Collision avoidance; Reservation systems; Supply chain management; Analytic models; Anti collision; Anti-collision protocols; Blocking; Blocking technique; Healthcare services; Identification process; Tag identification; Radio frequency identification (RFID)",,,,,,"Lai, Y.-C., Hsiao, L.-Y., Lin, B.-S., Optimal slot assignment for binary tracking tree protocol in RFID tag identification (2015) IEEE/ACM Trans.

One of the techniques used to minimize energy consumption in battery-operated mobile devices is user cooperation at the time of wireless transmission. In this paper, we formulate minimization of energy consumption through user cooperation routing in mobile devices that have multiinterfaces under a multi-hop network. User cooperation optimization will be exploited by selecting a short-range wireless communication that has the lowest energy consumption as a proxy for establishing long-range wireless communication. Two algorithms are proposed to solve the problem. Simulation results show that both algorithms are able to solve this cooperation problem and optimize energy efficiency. © 2016 IEEE.","energy efficiency; multi-hop; multi-wireless-interfaces; user cooperation; wireless network","Electric batteries; Energy utilization; Optimization; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Multihop; Multihop networks; Processing capability; Short-range wireless communications; User cooperation; Wireless communications; Wireless interfaces; Wireless transmissions; Energy efficiency",,,,,,"Feng, D., Jiang, C., Lim, G., Cimini, J.L., Feng, G., Li, G., A survey of energy-efficient wireless communications (2012) Communications Surveys & Tutorials, IEEE, PP, pp. 1-12; Wu, G., Yang, C., Li, S., Li, G.Y., Recent advances in energy-efficient networks and their application in 5G systems (2015) IEEE Wireless Communications, 22, pp. 145-151; Yaacoub, E., Dawy, Z., Sharafeddine, S., Abu-Dayya, A., Joint energy-distortion aware algorithms for cooperative video streaming over LTE networks (2013) Signal Processing: Image Communication, 28, pp. 1114-1131. , Oct; Sheng, Z., Fan, J., Liu, C.H., Leung, V.C.M., Liu, X., Leung, K.K., Energy-efficient relay selection for cooperative relaying in wireless multimedia networks (2015) IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 64, pp. 1156-1170; Bordon, R., Montejo Sanchez, S., Mafra, S.B., Souza, R.D., Rebelatto, J.L., Fernandez, E.M.G., Energy efficient power allocation schemes for a two-user network-coded cooperative cognitive radio network (2016) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 64, pp. 1654-1667; Deepak, K.S., Babu, A.V., Improving energy efficiency of incremental relay based cooperative communications in wireless body area networks (2015) International Journal of Communication Systems, 28, pp. 91-111; Radwan, A., Albano, M., Rodriguez, J., Verikoukis, C., Analysis of energy saving using cooperation use-case: WiFi and WiMedia (2012) Future Network & Mobile Summit (FutureNetw), 2012, pp. 1-10; Radwan, A., Rodriguez, J., Energy saving in multi-standard mobile terminals through short-range cooperation (2012) EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking, 2012, p. 159; Costa, M., Ephremides, A., Energy efficiency versus performance in cognitive wireless networks (2016) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 34, pp. 1336-1347; Fedrizzi, R., Rasheed, T., Cooperative short range routing for energy savings in multi-interface wireless networks (2013) Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring), 2013 IEEE 77th, pp. 1-5; Friedman, R., Kogan, A., Krivolapov, Y., On power and throughput tradeoffs of wifi and bluetooth in smartphones (2013) Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on, 12, pp. 1363-1376; Halperin, D., Greenstein, B., Sheth, A., Wetherall, D., Demystifying 802. 11n power consumption (2010) Proceedings of the 2010 International Conference on Power Aware Computing and Systems, , Vancouver, BC, Canada Presented at the; Huang, J., Qian, F., Gerber, A., Mao, Z.M., Sen, S., Spatscheck, O., A close examination of performance and power characteristics of 4G LTE networks (2012) Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services, , Low Wood Bay, Lake District, UK Presented at the",,,"IEEE Communications Society (IEEE ComSoc) Indonesia Chapter;Telkom University - School of Electrical Engineering","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Wireless and Mobile, APWiMob 2016","13 September 2016 through 15 September 2016",,125933,,9781509027675,,,"English","APWiMob - IEEE Asia Pac.

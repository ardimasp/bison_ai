This study aims to identify the most significant factors related to module quality, learning methods, and lecturers to improve student learning outcomes and how much they influence. Our essay used combination methods (Mixed Methods) qualitative and quantitative with cross sectional approach with respondents and resource persons from lecturers and students of Bina Nusantara University 143 people from various study programs. Data analysis used model multiple regression SPSS 16.0. Overall the findings show the effect of learning system innovation and the development of learning modules, learning methods and quality of lecturers on student learning outcomes. We used the same research toolalsoto show that the number of students in one class also has an impact on student learning outcomes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Students; Combination method; Learning methods; Learning modules; Mixed method; Multiple regressions; Student learning outcomes; System innovations; Learning systems",,,,,"Slameto, (1998) Belajar Dan Faktor-faktor Yang Mempengaruhinya, p. 5; Eny, S., Hubungan Gaya mengajar dosen dalam proses pembelajaran dengan motivasi belajar mahasiswa fakultas (2012) Jurnal Al-Azhar Indonesia Seri Humaniora, 1, p. 247; Vathsala, S., Senthu, J., The role of emotional engagement in lecturer-student interaction and the impact on academic outcomes of student achievement and learning (2012) Journal of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, 12, pp. 1-30; Lucky, S., Chux, G.I., Olumide, H.B., Factors influencing academic performance of university students Demography and Social Economy, 2, pp. 103-115; Jian, X., Stephen, W., (2015) The Effects of Lecturer Commitment on Student Perceptions of Teaching Quality and Student Satisfaction in Chinese Higher Education, 37, pp. 98-110; Allexander, M., Lecturers' competences and students' academic performance (2013) International Journal of Humanities and Social Science Invention, 3, pp. 06-13; Martin, R.E., Michael, E.C., A study exploring the impact of lecture capture availability and lecture capture usage on student attendance and attainment (2019) Hight Education Journal, 77 (3), pp. 403-421; Wati, R., (2009) Relationship between Learning Motivation, Lecturer and Employee Service Quality, and Availability of Learning Facilities with Student Achievement in Faculty of Economics; Kitto, S.C., Chesters, J., Grbich, C., Quality in qualitative research.

To increase the effectiveness of teamwork, the conflict problem must be solved. This study aimed to know the performance of students? abilities of conflict solving problems in doing the virtual teamwork in online learning. It was taken using convenience and using the quantitative method. The respondents are online learning students from varied semesters. There are 97 respondents consisting of students from several departments, i.e.: Information System, Business Management, Marketing Management, and Computer Science. It measured the conflict problem solving abilities performance of the respondents using the online learning management system with the Likert scale on the scale of 1 to 5 with corrected item total correlations 0.49, and α 0.81 (> 0.5). The performance is : scale 3 is chosen by 31.15% of respondents, scale 4 is 25.64%, the scale 2 is 16.40%, the scale 1 is 17.58%, and the scale 5 is just chosen by 8.87% of respondents. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Conflict problem solving; Learning management system; Online learning; Virtual teamwork","E-learning; Education; Educational technology; Human resource management; Information management; Marketing; Students; Business management; Digital technologies; Learning management system; Marketing management; Online learning; Problem-solving abilities; Quantitative method; Virtual teamwork; Problem solving",,,,,"Black, G., Student assessment of virtual teams in an online management course (2002) Journal of Business Administration Online, 1 (2). , https://www.atu.edu/jbao/fall2002/black; Kankanhalli, A., Tan, B.C.Y., Wei, K.K., Conflict and performance in global virtual teams (2006) Journal of Management Information Systems, , Singapore; Maina, T.M., (2013) Instant Messaging An Effective Way of Communication in Workplace, , Kenya Muranga University College; Mancini, D.J., Building organizational trust in virtual teams (2010) Journal of Behavioral Studies in Business, pp. 1-5; Marquez, J., (2003) The Effect of Instant Messaging on the Social Lives of Students within a College Dorm, , http://web.stanford.edu/class/pwr3-25/group2/pdfs/IM_Socia, USA : University of Stanford",,,"","Association for Computing Machinery","2017 International Conference on Digital Technology in Education, ICDTE 2017","6 August 2017 through 8 August 2017",,131203,,9781450352833,,,"English","ACM Int.

That is the reason why Binus University took part with a project called ‘environmental awareness socialization’ as an action to educate the society around Binus and the students as well. Before educating the society around Binus, who were done by several groups of the students, the students, called The Cleanliness Ambassador Program, must have the values of environmental awareness first. To have the values internalized, the students had to do this project using the SECI (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization) model, to transfer their knowledge about clean environment each other effectively as well as strengthen their teamwork. This study aimed to find the performance of the students while doing the project using the SECI model. Participants of this study were 100 undergraduate students who took CB-Spiritual Development subject (Binusian 2017) with this particular final project. This study taken using convenience sampling technique and used quantitative method by using the measurement of frequency for managing and interpreting the data.

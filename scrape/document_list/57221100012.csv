The presence of someone in an organization is a sign that the person is carrying out their obligations to come to the agency or organization. Usually, attendance is done manually. It can be signed or called one by one. In this digital age, there must be a change from this absence to be able to accelerate and provide time efficiency. We can use face recognition to record attendance from everyone present in an organization. In this face recognition, many algorithms are performed to dissect and capture images of someone’s face, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning. With this algorithm, the system can recognize a person’s face and record attendance from that person so that attendance activities are more efficient and faster. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Attendance management; Attendance system; Face capturing; Face recognition; Machine Learning","Computational methods; Deep learning; Intelligent systems; Software engineering; Attendance systems; Capture images; Digital age; Time efficiencies; Face recognition",,,,,"Agrawal, S., Khatri, P., Facial expression detection techniques: Based on Viola and Jones algorithm and principal component analysis (2015) 2015 Fifth International Conference on Advanced Computing & Communication Technologies, Pp. 108–112.

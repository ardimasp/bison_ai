A university located in South Jakarta has implemented an integrated system with e-learning portals for lecturers and students, but the success of the information system implementation has never been measured. As we know, the investment of information systems implementation could cost a lot of resources, time, and cost, which makes the measurement of the success of information systems a very important thing to do. The aim of this research is to measure the success of the e-learning system that was implemented in the university using the updated DeLone and McLean IS Success model (2003), with the objective to understand whether implementing an e-learning model really helped produced organizational benefits in the university such as good corporate image, and also to understand whether or not the updated DeLone and McLean IS Success model could really be used to assess the success of implementing e-learning in the university. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","D&m is success model; E-learning; Education; University",,,,,,"Chang, C.-C., Exploring the determinants of e-learning systems continuance intention in academic libraries (2013) Libr.

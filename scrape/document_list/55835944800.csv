To produce a good military force in a country, it would require an easy, fast and accurate military resource management. This study utilized geographic data as a reference for the location of the logistics resources to help simplify the management of military data using spatial data in Geographic Information System (GIS). The system development approach used JSON Service technology framework and HTML 5 to improve system performance. The features development of the management of military resources associated with military operations are conducted. Results of this study generate e-resource military operation system which is swift and in accordance with the W3C web standards. © 2013 Science Publications.","E-resources; GIS; JSON service1; Military operation",,,,,,"Ciflikli, B., Ozcan, O., Uysal, B.A., Model driven software development for military command and control systems (2012) Proceedings of the IEEE 36th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference, pp. 494-497. , Jul. 16-20, IEEE Xplore Press, Izmir, DOI: 10.1109/COMPSAC.2012.86; (2011) Military Networking Protocol (MNP), , DARPA, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; (2012) Active duty uniformed troop strength, , GS, Global Security; Loechel, A.J., Mihelcic, G., Pickl, S., An open source approach for a military situational awareness system (2012) Proceedings of the 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Science, pp. 1462-1471. , Jan. 4- 7, IEEE Xplore Press, Maui, HI., DOI: 10.1109/HICSS.2012.109; (2010) World military expenditure, , OCV; Severance, C., Discovering javascript object notation (2012) Computer, 45, pp. 6-8. , DOI: 10.1109/MC.2012.132; Venkat, G.., (2009) Why jQuery, , Vishwak Lab's White Paper; (2012) YSlow rules, , YD, Yahoo Incdeveloper","Kurniawan, A.; Department of Information Technology, , Jakarta Barat, Indonesia",,,"Science Publications",,,,,15493636,,,,"English","J.

Slowly but sure, IoT enters our experience in all things. Different visions of this IoT are reported and enabling technologies reviewed. What appears is that still significant issues must be faced by the research community. The technology that relates to IoT is still in development until now, and soon it will be used in human life. IoT embraced people to bring welfare and efficiency for every activity, played the role of technology development; IoT also shows people to think and invent more technology for every application such as vehicle and smart cities. Once it was implemented, the IoT will bring efficiency and make the activity more comfortable than before. The development of IoT also creates a vision for everybody, because it opens people's minds to technology development. Smart transportation will also be implemented in every city, and soon it will become a smart city. The efficiency and human development will pay the resources, technologies, contributions, and all works from scientists and researchers with transportation. © 2019 IEEE.","intelligent transportation system; IoT in Transportation; smart transportation system; Tire Sensor","Efficiency; Intelligent systems; Smart city; Enabling technologies; Intelligent transportation systems; Internet of thing (IOT); Research communities; Role of technologies; Technology development; Tire sensors; Transportation system; Internet of things",,,,,"Perera, C., Zaslavsky, A., Christen, P., Georgakopoulos, D., Context aware computing for the internet of things: A survey (2014) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 16 (1), pp. 414-454; Karakostas, B., A dns architecture for the internet of things: A case study in transport logistics (2013) Procedia Computer Science, 19, pp. 594-601; Guo, B., Zhang, D., Wang, Z., Yu, Z., Zhou, X., Opportunistic iot: Exploring the harmonious interaction between human and the internet of things (2013) Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 36 (6), pp. 1531-1539; Jing, Q., Vasilakos, A., Wan, J., Lu, J., Qiu, D., Security of the internet of things: Perspectives and challenges (2014) Wireless Networks, 20 (8), pp. 2481-2501; Miorandi, D., Sicari, S., De Pellegrini, F., Chlamtac, I., Internet of things: Vision, applications and research challenges (2012) Ad Hoc Networks, 10 (7), pp. 1497-1516; Olson, N., (2015) The Internet of ThingsGreengardSamuel, the Internet of Things, 18, p. 210. , The MIT Press: Cambridge, MA, $15.95 (Pbk); (2016) New Media & Society, 18 (4), pp. 680-682; Barnaghi, P., Wang, W., Henson, C., Taylor, K., Semantics for the internet of things (2012) International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems, 8 (1), pp. 1-21; Lee, I., Lee, K., The internet of things (iot): Applications, investments, and challenges for enterprises (2015) Business Horizons, 58 (4), pp. 431-440; Vlacheas, P., Giaffreda, R., Stavroulaki, V., Kelaidonis, D., Foteinos, V., Poulios, G., Demestichas, P., Moessner, K., Enabling smart cities through a cognitive management framework for the internet of things (2013) IEEE Communications Magazine, 51 (6), pp. 102-111; Miranda, J., Makitalo, N., Garcia-Alonso, J., Berrocal, J., Mikkonen, T., Canal, C., Murillo, J., From the internet of things to the internet of people (2015) IEEE Internet Computing, 19 (2), pp. 40-47; Bonomi, F., Milito, R., Zhu, J., Addepalli, S., Fog computing and its role in the internet of things (2012) Proceedings of the First Edition of the MCC Workshop on Mobile Cloud Computing-MCC '12, 20 (1), pp. 13-16; Al-Fuqaha, A., Guizani, M., Mohammadi, M., Aledhari, M., Ayyash, M., Internet of things: A survey on enabling technologies, protocols, and applications (2015) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 17 (4), pp. 2347-2376; Sánchez López, T., Ranasinghe, D., Harrison, M., McFarlane, D., Adding sense to the internet of things (2011) Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 16 (3), pp. 291-308; Mohanty, S., Choppali, U., Kougianos, E., Everything you wanted to know about smart cities: The internet of things is the backbone (2016) IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine, 5 (3), pp. 60-70; Zhao, K., Ge, L., A survey on the internet of things security 2013 Ninth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security(CIS), 43 (2), pp. 663-667. , Emeishan 614201, China China, 2013; Sicari, S., Rizzardi, A., Grieco, L., Coen-Porisini, A., Security, privacy and trust in internet of things: The road ahead (2015) Computer Networks, 76 (3), pp. 146-164; Jin, J., Gubbi, J., Marusic, S., Palaniswami, M., An information framework for creating a smart city through internet of things (2014) IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 1 (2), pp. 112-121; Botta, A., De Donato, W., Persico, V., Pescapé, A., Integration of cloud computing and internet of things: A survey (2016) Future Generation Computer Systems, 56 (2), pp. 684-700; Borgia, E., The internet of things vision: Key features, applications, and open issues (2014) Computer Communications, 54 (1), pp. 1-31; Li, S., Xu, L., Zhao, S., The internet of things: A survey (2014) Information Systems Frontiers, 17 (2), pp. 243-259; Weyrich, M., Ebert, C., Reference architectures for the internet of things (2016) IEEE Software, 33 (1), pp. 112-116; Zhuming, B., Li Da, X., Chengen, W., Internet of things for enterprise systems of modern manufacturing (2014) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 10 (2), pp. 1537-1546",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","7th International Conference on Cyber and IT Service Management, CITSM 2019","6 November 2019 through 7 November 2019",,157081,,9781728129099,,,"English","Int.

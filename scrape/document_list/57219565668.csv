One of the most prominent financial technology in Indonesia is e-wallet. Due to this, understanding factors, which influence users; intention to use and user satisfaction toward the use of e-wallet is essential. This study will apply the Modified DeLone-McLean IS Success Model, which explains customers' perspectives in terms of Behavioral Intention to Use and User Satisfaction with factors including Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Information Quality, and Service Quality. The research approach of this study is quantitative mono-method with a survey as the data collection method. The total respondents collected are 123 users, with the total valid samples used in this research are 107 respondents. Data analysis used in this research includes the reliability and data validity tests. In order to perform data analysis, Partial Least Squares (PLS) is utilized in providing relevant findings that would answer the research question. The hypothesis testing shows that Performance Expectancy influences Behavioral Intention to Use due to the fact that people is becoming more familiar with e-wallet and its benefits. E-wallet provides convenience for users to make a purchase. The result correlates with the expectation theory, which indicates that the confirmation of users' expectation will lead to their satisfaction toward the system (Fuksa, 2003). The finding suggests that Performance Expectancy is the most influential factor in determining both users' Behavioral Intention to Use and User Satisfaction toward the use of e-wallet. © 2020 IEEE.","Behavioural intention to use; DeLone-McLean IS success model; E-wallet; Effort expectancy; Information quality; Performance expectancy; Service quality; User satisfaction; UTAUT","Customer satisfaction; Data handling; Fintech; Information analysis; Information management; Least squares approximations; Reliability analysis; Service industry; Behavioral intention; Data collection method; Financial services industries; Hypothesis testing; Influential factors; Information quality; Partial least square (PLS); Research questions; Electronic money",,,,,"Prawirasasra, K.P., Financial technology in Indonesia: Disruptive or collaborative (2018) Report on Economics and Finance, 4 (2), pp. 83-90; (2015) Cleared for Takeoff-Five Megatrends That Will Change Financial Services', , Deloitte; McWaters, R.J., Bruno, G., Lee, A., Blake, M., The future of financial services-how disruptive innovations are reshaping the way financial services are structured, provisioned and consumed (2015) World Economic Forum; Pachpande, B.R., Kamble, A.A., Study of e-wallet awareness and its usage in mumbai (2018) Journal of Commerce & Management Thought, 9 (1), pp. 33-45; (2017) Penetrasi & Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia 2017, , Asosiasi Penyelenggara Jasa Internet Indonesia; (2018) The Little Data Book 2018 on Financial Inclusion, , World Bank; Pranata, N., Uluwiyah, A., Sinaga, A.S.R., Mockler, A., Ringrod, K., Assessing the impact of digital opportunity on financial inclusion (2018) The Eighth Research Dive on Financial Inclusion, p. 19; Pradibta, H., Acceptance of Mobile Payment Application in Indonesia; Chandra, Y.U., Bank vs telecommunication e-wallet: System analysis, purchase, and payment method of go-mobile cimb niaga and t-cash telkomsel (2017) 2017 International Conference on Information Management and Technology (ICIMTech), pp. 165-170; Azizah, N., Handayani, P.W., Azzahro, F., Factors influencing continuance usage of mobile wallets in Indonesia (2018) 2018 International Conference on Information Management and Technology (ICIMTech), pp. 92-97; Delone, W.H., McLean, E.R., The delone and mclean model of information systems success: A ten-year update (2003) Journal of Management Information Systems, 19 (4), pp. 9-30; Venkatesh, V., Morris, M.G., Davis, G.B., Davis, F.D., User acceptance of information technology: Toward a unified view (2003) MIS Quarterly, pp. 425-478; Omarini, A., (2017) The Digital Transformation in Banking and the Role of FinTechs in the New Financial Intermediation Scenario'; Lemon, K.N., Verhoef, P.C., Understanding customer experience throughout the customer journey (2016) Journal of Marketing, 80 (6), pp. 69-96; Mohsan, F., Nawaz, M.M., Khan, M.S., Shaukat, Z., Aslam, N., Impact of customer satisfaction on customer loyalty and intentions to switch: Evidence from banking sector of Pakistan (2011) International Journal of Business and Social Science, 2 (16); Das, K., Tamhane, T., Vatterott, B., Wibowo, P., Wintels, S., (2018) The Digital Archipelago: How Online Commerce Is Driving Indonesia's Economic Development, , McKinsey & Company, August; Indonesian consumer insights: The growing price of maintaining customer loyalty (2017) Snapcart Website, , Snapcart; Embracing bricks and clicks in Indonesia (2017) Deloitte, , Deloitte, 2017; Delone, W.H., Mclean, E.R., Measuring e-commerce success: Applying the delone & mclean information systems success model (2004) International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 9 (1), pp. 31-47; Rogers, E.M., Diffusion of innovations: Modifications of a model for telecommunications (1995) Die Diffusion von Innovationen in der Telekommunikation, pp. 25-38. , Springer; Leong, L.-Y., Hew, T.-S., Ooi, K.-B., Wei, J., Predicting mobile wallet resistance: A two-staged structural equation modeling-artificial neural network approach (2019) International Journal of Information Management, p. 102047; Seetharaman, A., Kumar, K.N., Palaniappan, S., Weber, G., Factors influencing behavioural intention to use the mobile wallet in Singapore (2017) Journal of Applied Economics & Business Research, 7 (2); Intarot, P., Beokhaimook, C., Influencing Factor in E-Wallet Acceptant and Use'; Saunders, M., Lewis, P., Thornhil, A., (2016) Research Method for Business, , 7th ed.

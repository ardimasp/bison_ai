This can be seen from the development of technology in pharmaceutical companies in Jakarta that use Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS). HRIS provides services in the form of management information for all employees in the company. Currently, not many have conducted risk analysis on the information systems used. On the one hand, information systems have become a part that is difficult to access in almost every business process in the company. The use of technology can present threats that can affect applicable risks. Therefore, companies need to pay attention to risk management to anticipate the dangers that can occur. The study uses the COBIT 5 framework to analyze the risks that occur in the company by using the domain Monitor, Evaluate, Assessment MEA02 because it is related to the transparency process for the main stakeholders regarding the appropriateness of the internal control system so that it can ensure the achievement of company goals and objectives and provide sufficient knowledge about the system risk of human resource information. The research starts from references, determines the domains and processes used, analyzes HRIS, compiles interview lists, analyzes interview results, calculates process capability models from HRIS implementation and analyzes HRIS to risk management. The output of this study is the acquisition of risk management documents in pharmaceutical companies that contain lists of risks, level risks, impacts, risks, and the results of recommendations using the MEA02 domain from COBIT 5 and a SWOT analysis. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS","COBIT 5; Human Resource Information System (HRIS); Monitor-Evaluate-Assess (MEA)",,,,,,,"Andry, J.

However, there are less understandings on factors influencing the uses. Looking at existing literature, the uses of social media within a government are focused on transparency, openness, collaboration, and citizen participation. Hence, this study aims at investigating factors influencing the uses. Four theories being considered intentionally follow prior researches (i.e., transparency, openness, participation, and collaboration). Particularly, this study attempts to examine factors influencing people behavior within a government in using social media to accomplish their activities in various aspects, including politics, economics, social, culture, defense, and security. Besides, the uses are observed in several governmental tasks such as dealing with complaints, reports and documentation, critics and suggestions, and information dissemination to citizens. Therefore, this study will deliver a new understanding to the government on factors influencing their uses of social media, including how they might use social media accordingly to the needs of their citizens. © 2020 IEEE.","Citizen interaction; Collaboration; Government; Information; Openness; Participation; Social media; Transparency","Behavioral research; Economics; Information dissemination; Information management; Transparency; Citizen participation; People behavior; Social media; Systematic literature review; Social networking (online)",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

The development of this technology has helped many companies in improving the performance and business processes of the main and supporting companies. Information technology in companies is needed to support their business processes. This distribution company is currently not assisted by information technology in carrying out its business activities, therefore some of the company's business processes such as scheduling the delivery of goods that are not well organized due to customer demand, data collection of goods in and out of warehouses that are not recorded, and others. This makes the company requires the development of information technology in helping the company's business processes. Enterprise architecture can help companies in designing the development of information systems in the company. Enterprise architecture has several frameworks that can be used in the design of information systems such as the TOGAF, Zachman Framework, and others. TOGAF framework will be used in this research as a modelling in designing the process of developing enterprise information systems. The results of this study will be in the form of proposed TOGAF method models that have been adapted to business processes and business needs of the company to help improve the company's business processes. © 2020 Little Lion Scientific.

Such an idea did not fulfill the government's expectations, because it failed to involve the wider community. Key factors that can explain and predict citizen participation have not been thoroughly identified. The purpose of this research is to identify relevant factors that can influence the intention of citizens to engage in e-Participation through social media initiatives. The research involved 349 end-users of social media-based e-government applications in Tangerang, Indonesia (Laksa application) which carried out to develop a model aimed at explaining and predicting citizens' behavioral intentions on their involvement in government e-Participation initiatives through social media. The methodological approach is based on the utilization and expansion of one of the well-known theories to describe someone‟s acceptance behavior, namely Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The proposed model also draws from several best practices related to technology diffusions such as TRI, TAM, UTAUT, IS / IT Success Models, and other factors that influence the application of social media-based e-Government such as navigation, accessibility, security, design and innovativeness based on previous research. The proposed model can bring a better understanding of important issues especially in the process of adopting social media-based e-Government.

There are many problems that can be answered with Machine Learning method, one of them is on educational scope. Many Educators right now cannot identify whether a certain student is on the brink of failing or not. As a result, many college students failed because the educators cannot help them. In this paper, we present our user-friendly decision support tool made from Machine Learning algorithm and to answer the problem we focus, which is to prevent college student from failing by providing educational agents necessary information and predictions. Our objective is to know which machine learning algorithm that can be used to predict the student’s performance and to create a decision support tool that can be used by educational agents so that educational agents can prevent student from failing the course. © BEIESP.","Classifier; Data Training; Dataset; Model",,,,,,,"Sommer, D., Sood, B., (2014) Market Share Analysis: Business Intelligence and Analytics Software, , Gartner Research Report; Negash, S., (2003) Business Intelligence.

The purpose of e-Government who wants to improve public services, with the help of information and communication technology. The best solution is using social media. In Indonesia, e-Government is a concept that is implemented not only by the central government, but also by regional/local governments. Right now, many local governments in Indonesia already implemented e-Government. However, not all of Indonesia local governments that implemented e-government have a social media-based e-Government application. There is a chance that a certain city/regency at Indonesia using same social media-based e-Government application. If the application is seen in terms of features, each application also has different features combination, which are the strengths and the uniqueness of each application. In this study, there are 9 applications that examined from 9 cities / regency in Indonesia. The purpose of this study is to analyse the relation between e-government and social media, in terms of using social media features and identified features that exist in each e-Government application that examined from 9 cities / regency in Indonesia with Systematic Literature Review. The feature found will be categorized with feature functionality categorization: Identity, Conversations, Sharing, Presence, Relationships, Reputation, and Groups. Each feature found can be having more than 1 feature functionality. The result of this study can be used as an indicator about features available at social media-based e-Government application and this study can be used to be a comparison or references for making another social media-based e-Government application in the future. © BEIESP.","E-Government Application; Feature; Social Media; Systematic Literature Review",,,,,,,"Putra, I.G.L.A.R., Swastika, I.P.A., Analisis Kerangka Kerja e-Government Assessment Pada Situs Website Pemerintah Daerah di Indonesia (2016) Seminar Nasional Teknologi Informasi Dan Komunikasi, 2016, pp. 295-304. , SENTIKA 2016; Hardjaloka, L., Studi Penerapan e-Government Di Indonesia (2014) Jurnal Rechtsvinding, 3 (3), pp. 435-452. , Dan Negara Lainnya Sebagai Solusi Pemberantasan Korupsi Di Sektor Publik; Haerana, A., Amartiwi, I., IbM Pelatihan Teknik Pengaduan Pelayanan Publik Berbasis E-Government Di Kecamatan Rappocini Kota Makassar (2019) Celebes Abdimas: Jurnal Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat, 1 (1), pp. 21-35; Sitokdana, M.N.N., Evaluasi Implementasi eGovernment Pada Situs Web Pemerintah Kota Surabaya, Medan, Banjarmasin, Makassar dan Jayapura (2015) Jurnal Buana Informatika, 6 (4), pp. 289-300; Izzati, N.A., Pratama, A., Aristamy, I.M., Najwa, N.F., Rakhmawati, N.A., Kategorisasi Jenis Interaksi Pemerintah Dan Masyarakat Serta Popularitas Media Sosial Pemerintah Daerah (2018) Jurnal Sistem Informasi, 14 (1), pp. 1-8; Rahadi, D.R., Perilaku Pengguna Dan Informasi Hoax Di Media Sosial (2017) Jurnal Manajemen Dan Kewirausahaan, 5 (1), pp. 58-70; Rita Hutomo, K., Natalia, Electronic Word of Mouth (E-WOM) Foursquare: The New Social Media (2013) Binus Business Review, 4 (2), pp. 711-724; Assegaff, S., Evaluasi Pemanfaatan Media Sosial sebagai Sarana Knowledge Sharing (2017) Jurnal Manajemen Teknologi, 16 (3), pp. 271-293; Furqon, M.A., Hermansyah, D., Sari, R., Sukma, A., Akbar, Y., Rakhmawati, N.A., Analisis Sosial Media Pemerintah Daerah Di Indonesia Berdasarkan Respons Warganet (2018) Jurnal Sosioteknologi, 17 (2), pp. 177-190; Parsaorantua, P.H., Pasoreh, Y., Rondonuwu, S.A., (2017) E-Journal “Acta Diurna”, 6 (3); Rachmawati, R., Ramadhan, E., Rohmah, A.A., Aplikasi Smart Province “Jogja Istimewa”: Penyediaan Informasi Terintegrasi dan Pemanfaatannya (2018) Majalah Geografi Indonesia, 32 (1), pp. 14-23; Transparency and Accountability through ICTs, Social Media, and Collaborative E-Government Transforming Government: People Process and Policy, 6 (1), pp. 78-91; Irawan, E.P., Pemanfaatan Website Pada Aktivitas Cyber PR dalam Mendukung e-Government di Pemerintah Kota Tangerang Selatan (2017) Jurnal Ilmu Pengetahuan Dan Teknologi Komunikasi, 19 (2), pp. 163-177; Charalabidis, Y., Loukis, E.N., Androutsopoulou, A., Karkaletsis, V., Triantafillou, A., Passive crowdsourcing in government using social media (2014) Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy, 8 (2), pp. 283-308; Megawati, C., (2015) Analisi Aspirasi Dan Pengaduan Di Situs LAPOR!

To improve the usefulness of this service, we conduct research with the aim of evaluating and identifying the factors that affect the service's application. The impact of this study is that the government can provide services according to the wishes of the community, because the model found can be a reference for the government to increase public trust and satisfaction for users of government services. The influence on the adoption of Aspiration Services is explained by using perceptions of trust, attitudes, and intentions of use that refer to technology acceptance models (TAM).

Government has spent a lot of time, money, and sources to improve the public service but there are always challenges to improve public interest in using social media-based e-government applications. Web 2.0 and social media provide opportunities to user that is the community, stakeholders, and service providers to discuss and share opinions about features regarding people’s expectations. This study involved 349 people as end users and 10 service providers in producing e-government features based on social media according to their expectations. Society as application’s user was asked to see the current quality of social media-based e-government services based on end users. This aimed to conduct evaluations so that they could propose features for the development of social media-based e-government application. © 2019, ICIC International.

Social media application offers benefits in the form of a channel of communication between the community and the government or the group that has public interest. Through this application, the public could channel complaints about public services. Perception becomes the important key for this condition because user action is determined by their perception toward the government e-services. The result of standard measurement for customer satisfaction on government organization is used to help find the weakness of the service and correct it. The interface is made to be more user-friendly to ensure the effective service. So, it is necessary to develop the system continuously. Perceived quality is one of the important determinants of the success of social media application, therefore needs identification of the user's perception and expectations and involving becomes the key to success besides the good quality that will increase the trust and satisfaction of users.

The key strategy is by providing credit project fund to various social communities all over Indonesia in order to enhance capability and productivity of the communities themselves. To get the funding, the communities give the proposals which will be verified by the management of PNPM Mandiri. The proposal assessment has many criteria to determine the feasibility of proposal. To support the decision making made by PNPM management, therefore we developed a decision support system (DSS) that supports the Government Loan allocation. The result shows that the DSS help the PNPM management to customize the existing model.

Syahdan No. 9, Palmerah Jakarta Barat, 11480, Indonesia","The process of decision support for higher education institution to determine the concentration of study program becomes a significant problem because the student needs to analyse their interest, ability, and other factors as the qualification. A mistake in decision-making will be detrimental to the students' education level, and it can even affect their future. This is a problem that occurs every semester, not only within the scope of the faculty but also in the university. Therefore, this research proposes a model to ease the higher education institution in determining a concentration of student using AHP and TOPSIS method. AHP method is a decision support system that can give weight on criteria of concentration and test its consistency. This method is to give weight for each criterion of student concentration majoring in Information System. TOPSIS method has a concept that the appropriate alternative has the shortest distance with a positive ideal solution and has the farthest distance with a negative ideal solution. Moreover, the criteria for choosing the concentration are multiple intelligences, GPA, course score, and TOEFL score. Weights obtained from AHP become the input value in the TOPSIS method in sorting the alternatives to be selected. Then, the result of the sorting is being calculated for its accuracy level. Based on the calculation of 93 sample of student's concentration with AHP-TOPSIS method, 62 data are the same, so it results in the accuracy of 67%. An application with AHP-TOPSIS method can be used to help the university management in determining the concentration at Information System major for XYZ University. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.

Its also becomes a media to create the development community concept [1]. Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat (PNPM) Mandiri Perdesaan is a real form action to ward off the poverty in Indonesia. One of the efforts is by giving a physical project fund, which is expected to increase productivity and efficiency of the community itself. To obtain the donation, the social groups of communities should previously submit proposal which are verified by the management of Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat (PNPM) Mandiri Perdesaan. There are many criteria and proposals that require PNPM management to be able to take into account the benefits and risks of its decision. To support the PNPM management decision, it has been designed a system that afford helping PNPM management in allocating physical project fund. A result of this study shows that decision support system for fund allocation for physical project will help PNPM management in making, removing, or editing the existing assessment models. With an easiness of making a model, PNPM management will be able to understand the most appropriate model to be applied in physical project, so that the allocation for physical project fund is really gained by social groups that need it. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

The usage of credit scoring can be used to help the credit risk analysis in determining the applicant's eligibility. Data mining has been proven as a valuable tool for credit scoring. The aim of this research is to design a data mining model for credit scoring in bank in order to support and improve the performance of the credit analyst job. The proposed model applies classification using Naïve Bayes and ID3 algorithm. The accuracy of Naïve Bayes classifier is 82% and ID3 is 76%. So we can conclude that Naïve Bayes classifier has better accuracy than ID3 classifier. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

The smaller deterioration on host media after embedding the information, the system hiding is more successful because it shows there is no significant different between the original host image and the host image after embedded. This study proposes hiding information into a host image so that the deterioration is minimal using least significant bit (LSB) substitution and modified ant algorithm. The minimal deterioration is achieved when each pixels on the information is appropriate hidden on pixels on host media. The minimal deterioration as objective function is get by chasing the maximal peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). This proposed method is implemented on some hosts image with two image information. The results show the host embedded image has no the different significant with the original host image with PSNR between about 63-73. © 2016 IEEE.","Ant colony optimization; Deterioration; Information hiding; Optimal","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Deterioration; Pixels; Signal to noise ratio; Software engineering; Ant Colony Optimization algorithms; Hiding informations; Information hiding; Least significant bits; Modified ant algorithm; Objective functions; Optimal; Peak signal to noise ratio; Optimization",,,,,"Awad, W., Information hiding using ant colony optimization algorithm (2013) Diffus.

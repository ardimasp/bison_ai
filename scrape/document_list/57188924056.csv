The research method proposes an interview and observation of the prevalent system. The software development life cycle, applied to this research has posed an incremental model. The outcome of the research delineated a file sharing android application integrated with the desktop application. There is a ubiquitous file sharing application. However, the customization of integrated file sharing in android application with the contemporary application on intranet particularly is inaccessible on the market. Therefore, the DIVA is proposed as a possible solution. © 2016 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Desktop; File sharing application; Integrated android application; Mobile communication apps",,,,,,"Spaho, K., (2011) Business Intelligence Journal, 4, p. 390; Al-Fedaghi, S., Al Zanaidi, D., Flow-Based Scenarios in Mobile Communication Systems and Networks (2013) International Journal on Communications Antenna and Propagation (IRECAP), 3 (2), pp. 131-139; Ventola, C.L., (2014) Mobile Devices and Apps for Health Care Professionals: Uses and Benefits, 39 (5); Castro, M., Druschel, P., Ganesh, A., Rowstron, A., Wallach, D.S., Secure routing for structured peer-to-peer overlay networks (2002) Proceedings of the 5Th Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation, , December; New York, USA; Jaramill, D., Katz, N., Bodin, B., Tworek, W., Smart, R., Cook, T., Cooperative solutions for Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) (2013) IBM Journal of Research and Development, 57, 6p; Shah, P., Paris, J., Peer-to-Peer Multimedia Streaming Using Bit Torrent (2007) Proceedings of the Performance, Computing, and Communications, , April; 11-13; New Orleans, LA; Pouwelse, J.A., Garbacki, P., Epema, D.H.J., Sips, H.J., A Measurement Study of the Bittorrent Peer-To-Peer File-Sharing System, , Technical Report (2004-07); Schneiderman, B., (1986) Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design; Schneiderman, B., Software Psychology: Human Factors in Computer and Information Systems (1980) Winthrop Publishers; Jacobson, I., Booch, G., Rumbaugh, J., The Unified Software Development Process (1999) Addisonwesley; Larman, C., Basili, V.R., Iterative and Incremental Development: A Brief History (2003) IEEE Computer Society; Rumbaugh, J., Jacobson, I., Booch, G., Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual (2004) Pearson Higher Education; Schneiderman, B., (1986) Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design; Enshaei, M., Mohd Hanapi, Z., Othman, M., A Review: Mobile Ad Hoc Networks Challenges, Attacks, Security, Vulnerability and Routing Protocols (2014) International Journal on Communications Antenna and Propagation (IRECAP), 4 (5), pp. 168-179",,,,"Praise Worthy Prize",,,,,18286003,,,,"English","Int.

The data used in this study was secondary data in the form of annual financial statements and stock prices. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and a quantitative approach were used to calculate the various banking efficiency levels. Multiple linear regression analysis was also used to examine the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Based on the hypothesis testing results, banking efficiency partially did not influence stock return, however, earnings per share and the price-earnings ratio were shown to have a partial positive influence on stock return. The results of the hypothesis testing simultaneously showed that banking efficiency, earnings per share, and price-earnings ratio influenced stock return. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Banking efficiency; Data envelopment analysis; Earnings per share; Price-earnings ratio; Stock return",,,,,,"The author wishes to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika journal team that help publish this article.","Ajija, S.

This research work made use of panel data gotten from 31 banks listed in the Indonesian Stock Exchange for the period of 2007 - 2017. The analysis technique used was the fixed effect model. The result obtained showed that the variables of BI-Rate, exchange rate and inflation influenced the consumer behaviour variables (credit interest rate and deposit interest rate). Variables such as gross domestic products and liquidity significantly affect the deposit interest rate and the credit interest rate. The deposit value is significantly affected by the deposit interest rate, exchange rate and the gross domestic product while the credit outstanding value is significantly affected by the credit interest rate, liquidity and all macro and monetary economic variables in the models. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Consumer behaviour; Liquidity; Macroeconomics; Monetary policy",,,,,,"The authors wish to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika journal team that help publish this article.","Bansal, R., Coleman, W.

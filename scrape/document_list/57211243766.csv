The equation is solved numerically by using finite difference methods with Forward Time Backward Space approach. The model is simulated by using python-based desktop application to show the flow characteristics. Computational results are displayed in the form of summaries, tables, two-dimensional graphics, and three-dimensional graphics. Validation is done by comparing computational results data with data from the other studies that have been done before and concluded that the simulation results have been valid and indicate compliance with the prior studies. The simulation results show that trapezoidal channel is better at minimizing the risk of flooding than rectangular channel in consideration of smaller discharge, smaller velocity, and lower water level. © 2019 The Authors.

One of the features of CRM are customer satisfaction level analyses. It is a verbal communication means of sending or receiving information. There are several intonations spoken during verbal communication that reflect the emotional state. Therefore, it can be used to get information regarding the level of customer satisfaction. Sound is one type of digital data that can be processed for an emotional state of classification. In this research, the authors decided to develop a mobile application that is integrated with machine learning to record a sound and classify it into a particular emotional state. This application is believed to be able to improve the user experience and simplify the installation to improve communication engagement. © 2019 IEEE.","component; formatting; style; styling","Android (operating system); Information management; Mobile computing; Public relations; Sales; Application development; component; Customer relationship management; formatting; Mobile applications; style; styling; Verbal communications; Customer satisfaction",,,,,"A Face Recognition System Based on Convolution Neural Network Using Multiple Distance Face, Soft Computing; A Simulation Model for the Waterfall Software Development Life Cycle, International Journal of Engineering & Technology, 25; Chennai, S., (2016) Salesforce, , https://www.salesforcetraining.education/importance-featuressalesforce-make-mandatory-learn/, July 26 Retrieved from www. salesforcetraining. education:; (2013) International Conference on Cognitive Infocommunications, 403-406, , Classification of Emotional Speech Units in Call Centre Interactions Budapest, IEEE; (2011) International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 5692-5695. , Iterative feature normalization for emotional speech detection Prague, Czech RepublicIEEE; (2015) Python in Science Conference, pp. 18-24. , librosa: Audio and Music Signal Analysis in Python; Speech Emotion Recognition Approaches in Human Computer Interaction, Telecommunication Systems, 523, pp. 1467-1478; Speech Emotion Recognition Using Support Vector Machine, International Journal of Smart Home, pp. 6101-6107; Priyotno, A., (2019), https://inet.detik.com/consumer/d-4446865/samsung-masih-rajaponsel-di-Indonesia-ini-daftar-5-besarnya, Feb 27 detik com.

During Jakarta attack, bombs and gunfire in January 14, 2016 many Indonesians defied terror with messages ""We are not afraid"" and ""Unite Indonesia""They are using the hashtag #KamiTidakTakut, which can be translated as ""We are not afraid"", or hashtag #JakartaBerani, which means ""Jakarta is brave"". The next day, Indonesia regained national resilience by having normal activity. This research attempts to examine the roles of social media toward Indonesian's national resilience after the bombing. This research gathered data from social media such as Facebook, Path, Instagram and Twitter on posting, sharing posting, tweeting and re-tweeting during the event of a terrorist attack. Methodology approaches conducted in this research were qualitative study by questionnaire. This research offers insights into a broad range of views from users of social media about the use of social in building national resilience. The strength of the report is that it provides in-depth understanding of social media users and enhances government the use of social media for building national resilience. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Terrorism; Facebook; In-buildings; In-depth understanding; Indonesia; Methodology approaches; Qualitative study; Social media; Terrorist attacks; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Antoci, A., Sabatini, F., Sodini, M., (2011) Bowling Alone but Tweeting Together: The Evolution of Human Interaction in the Social Networking Era, , (Rome, mimeo: Sapienza University of Rome); Buckley, M.E., Fawn, R., (2003) Global Responses to Terrorism: 9/11, Afghanistan, and beyond, , (London, Routledge); Dershowitz, A.M., (2002) Why Terrorism Works: Understanding the Threat, Responding to the Challenge, , (London: Yale University Press); Dufty, N., Using social media to build community disaster resilience (2012) The Australian Journal of Emergency Management, 27, pp. 40-45; Ellison, N.B., Steinfield, C., Lampe, C., The benefits of Facebook friends: Social capital and college students' use of online social network sites (2007) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 12 (4), pp. 1143-1168; Manyena, S.B., The concept of resilience revisited (2006) Disasters Journal, 30, pp. 433-450; Norris, F.H., Stevens, S.P., Pfefferbaum, B., Wyche, K.F., Pfefferbaum, R.L., Community Resilience as a Metaphor, Theory, Set of Capacities, and Strategy for Disaster Readiness (2008) American Journal of Community Psychology, 41 (1-2), pp. 127-150; Rizza, C., Pereira, G.A., Building a resilient community through social network: Ethical considerations about the 2011 Genoa floods (2014) Proceedings of the 11th International ISCRAM Conference - University Park, Pennsylvania, USA, May 2014, , ed S R Hiltz, M S Pfaff, L Plotnick and P C Shih",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Advance and Scientific Innovation, ICASI 2018","23 April 2018 through 24 April 2018",,148653,17426588,,,,"English","J.

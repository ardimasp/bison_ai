This research is descriptive and associative methodology at all company that produce helmet in Indonesia. Data collection was done through literature study, interview and questionnaire. The analysis tool used is linear hierarchical model with SPSS version 22. The result showed Product Innovation has an influence on the competitiveness of the national helmet industry. Product Innovation will not improve competitiveness while Standardization SNI as a moderating variable influences negatively. SNI Standard should be more relied on industries condition and the market need, so SNI seems not be a solution to the industry to get competitiveness. © IJSTR 2019.","Competitiveness; Linear hierarchical model; Product innovation; Standardization SNI",,,,,,"Mu, J., Thomas, E., Peng, G., Di Benedetto, A., Strategic orientation and new product development performance: The role of networking capability and networking ability (2017) Ind.

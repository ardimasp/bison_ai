The model is commonly benefited by decision maker to solve semi/unstructured problems. In Indonesia, the issue of waste is challenging. This issue requests a restrictive and judicious treatment to execute, as a ruinous outcome for all intents and purposes created from inaccurate technique usage in treating is wide extending, especially for human’s life and well being and furthermore for the condition. This research offers a conventional shrewd ecological decision support model (Eco-DSM) for treating medical waste. The numerical model dependent on fuzzy logic conception joined with the other heuristic improvement technique is worked to quantify and legitimize six choices of treating strategy decisions. The experiment involved 5 types of waste (general waste, sharp waste, infectious waste, pathological waste and hazardous waste) and 6 medical waste treatment methods (incinerator, autoclave, microwave, mechanical processing and chemical disinfection, vitrification and landfill).

Generating a report for stakeholders quickly and accurately is highly required in assisting them making a data-driven decision. By developing a data warehouse, it is possible for a company to do a data-driven decision making to appeal to their customer segments. This paper proposes a data warehouse model design to analyse the sales data contained in the database. The method that was implemented for this particular data warehouse development is the nine-step methodology designed by Kimball.

Particularly in case of automotive industry, to select the most appropriate personal vehicle is challenging for the customers. The challenge was taken as a main problem of this study. In this research, the reasonableness is characterized by the customer parameters which portray the customer's identity. By utilizing the mix technique for fuzzy-logic and Euclidean distance calculation, the customer's identities are fitted into the personal-vehicle parameters. At long last, the constructed model for choosing personal vehicle plays several customer's parameters; e.g., age, gender, education, income and job. The model designed thru utilizing the object-oriented methodology. The result of simulation of 66 purchasers and 44 conceivable vehicles are able to propose the most reasonable vehicle for every purchaser. As an extended version, the model successfully delivers the completed scheme due to added parameters and method.

Tragically, numerous ways to deal with range detecting do not function admirably in low signal to noise ratio (SNR) situations and noise uncertainty. The GLRT approach can form other algorithms if it uses a derivation with the right assumptions. In previous research, the calculation of the GLRT approach is generally used in multi-antenna equipment, given the fact that the idea of the GLRT approach can accept multi-antenna wire parameters. Multi-antenna is used to describe the number of IoT devices because these devices are widely used in the industrial revolution now. Signal space-time block coding (MIMO-STBC-OFDM) is used as a multi-antenna signal from the primary signal (PU). Rayleigh distributed channel using a Geometric Based Single Bounce (GBSB) and also use as the multi-antenna from the secondary user (SU). This research wants to show if all algorithms derived from the GLRT approach can overcome the problem of noise uncertainty, small SNR, and choose which algorithm is very suitable for use in this condition. Simulation set up to solve issues shown by the results of the correlation multi-antenna receiver matrix (Rx) in the SU. The results show that the GLRT algorithm is robust because the GLRT approach does not require noise power assumption. On the other hand, the calculation of the algorithm using the GLRT approach shows if the algorithm can overcome the problem of vulnerability at a low SNR level and noise uncertainty. The final comparison results also show that the GLRT Kernel (KGLRT) algorithm can be stable in a multi-antenna IoT device. © 2020 IEEE.","Cognitive radio; GLRT approach; Spectrum sensing","Antennas; Block codes; Cognitive radio; Information management; Internet of things; Radio systems; Space-time block coding (STBC); Turbo codes; Comparison result; Distributed channels; Industrial revolutions; Low signal-to-noise ratio; Multi-antenna receivers; Noise uncertainties; Spectrum sensing; Wire parameters; Signal to noise ratio",,,,,"Qiu, R.C., Hu, Z., Li, H., Wicks, M.C., Cognitive radio network as sensors (2012) Cogn.

When this research was written, there were 1,780,315 positive cases globally. Countries in the world take various actions to curb the spread of this new virus. China is taking strict lockdown steps, while other countries such as South Korea are using massive diagnoses. While it might only be acceptable for countries with not too big populations, what the South Korean Government is doing is very interesting to research so that it can be recognized by other countries. This study use data mining techniques to search for pattern or new information from the data of the Covid-19 patients in South Korea. This study studies the use of decision trees to process the data in South Korea by finding the most optimal decision tree criteria. This study contributes to the data mining related field by showing decision tree is good enough to analyze the data. There are three best criteria for using a decision tree to predict deaths from this new virus. The best decision tree metrics are the gain ratio, knowledge gain and the gini index. In this analysis the gain-ratio is use for further analysis. Another finding is the province or location of this virus is the important factor. The implication of this finding supports the strategy of reducing virus transmission. Sex and age also play an important role in the prediction model. © 2020 Little Lion Scientific.

The use of spectrum is now considered very minimal and raises the problem of scarcity of spectrum. But after testing the real problem is the spectrum in utilization. This problem can be overcome by using efficient utilization of CR technology using Spectrum Sensing. Sensing algorithms that are usually used such as: a suitable filter, energy detector and cyclostationary are not enough because there are many antennas to be detected. In the case of multi-antenna detection, research usually uses the Generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) approach. The GLRT Approach Detector also has three types of detectors, type-3 detectors do not determine statistical tests. However, if you use monte carlo or the literacy algorithm, you need a lot of data to get the detector performance. this research will combine algorithms using bootstrap to determine detector performance using small data because using Bootstrap basically only requires a small resampling. The research wants to show if a type-3 detector can help the detector produce good probabilities using little data. The expected result is that the GLRT approach can be combined with a bootstrap for type-3 detectors such as: arithmetic and geometric statistical tests (TAGM) and GLRT time code space code statistical tests (TSTBCGLRT) to help determine assumptions Pd assumptions. Then an experiment was carried out to determine the threshold, by comparing bootstrap with monte carlo, research is expected to show that bootstrap works without a known H0 distribution and set the same threshold at all times. ©BEIESP.","Bootstrap; Cognitive Radio; Multi-Antenna",,,,,,"Derek, T., Otermat, I.K., Otero, C.E., Analysis of the fm radio spectrum for secondary licensing of low-power short-range cognitive internet of things devices (2016) IEEE Access, 4, pp. 6681-6691; Rendy, B., Understanding dynamic spectrum access: Models,taxonomy and challenges (2011) IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks, 1st, pp. 649-663; A design method of cognitive overlay links for satellite communications Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 15Th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop (ASMS/SPSC) 2018, pp. 1-6. , 9th; Annamalai, A., Energy detection of unknown deterministic signals in-and-generalized fading channels with diversity receivers (2014) International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC), pp. 761-765. , 1st; Kumar, A., Saumya Dwivedi, A.K.J., Glrt-based spectrum sensing for mimo sc-fdma cognitive radio systems in the presence of synchronization impairments (2016) IEEE Wireless Communications Letters, pp. 280-283; Islam, M.T., Muhammad Sajjad Khan, I.K., Simo-based coarse fine sensing scheme for wideband cognitive radio communication (2015) International Conference on Electrical and Electronic Engineering ICEEE, 26 (3), pp. 205-208; Fajar Nugraha Suhartono Tjondronegoro, F.Y.S., Spectrum sensing of ofdm signals using glrt detector with bootstrap approach (2015) International Conference on Telecommunication Systems Services and Applications (TSSA), 9, pp. 1-6; Suratman, F.Y., Spectrum sensing in cognitive radio: Bootstrap and sequential detection approaches (2014) Dissertation TU Darmstadt; Mohamed, S., Hadj Irid, S.K., A novel algorithm using spatial samplimg and bootstrap to estimate closed space doa for few samples (2017) International Conference on Electrical Engineering-Boumerdes (ICEE-B), pp. 1-5; Kai Feng, L.L., Source detection using bootstrap technique in spatial nonuniform noise (2015) Fourth International Conference on Instrumentation and Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control, pp. 306-310; Luo Meng, H., (2013) Threshold Estimation Method for Spectrum Sensing Using Bootstrap Technique, , Intelligent Computing Theories, Springer, 1st; Mouchini, T., Khalida Ghanem, M.D.A.Z., (2018) Bootstrap Approach for Cognitive Radio, pp. 155-158. , International Conference on Smart Communications in Network Technologies (SaCoNeT); Zeng, Glrt-based spectrum sensing forcognitive radio (2008) IEEE GLOBECOM 2008-2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, pp. 1-5. , 1st; Eigenvalue-based spectrum sensing of orthogonal space-time block coded signals (2014) IEEE Trans Signal, 60 (12)",,,,"Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication",,,,,22773878,,,,"English","Int.

This study was conducted in PT XYZ, a small company which had problems in selecting and evaluating the candidate employees for some higher positions in an attempt of improving the effectiveness of their employees’ performance. The respondents were nine employees with different positions. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) system, Expert Choice software, interview, and questionnaire were used to solve the problem. The results show: first, shift 3 supervisor is eligible to get promoted to line A supervisor. Second, shift 1 supervisor is eligible to be promoted to line B supervisor; and third, line B supervisor is more qualified to be promoted to a production manager than supervisor A. They are eligible to be promoted because they have met the criteria according to standard of the performance appraisal using AHP. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","AHP; Performance appraisal; Promotion selection",,,,,,"Al-Salamin, H., Al-Baqshi, J., Micro-factors influencing site selection for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Saudi Arabia: Alhassa area using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) analysis (2015) European Scientific Journal, ESJ, 11 (28); Alberto, P., The logistics of industrial location decisions:An application of the analytic hierarchy process methodology (2000) International JournalofLogistics:ResearchandApplications, 3 (3), pp. 273-289; Aro-Gordon, S., An IT-based appraisal model for effective performance management system in Nigeria (2015) 4 th International Conference on Managing Human Resources at the Workplace, , December 4-5; Bhattacharya, S., Subramanian, J., Bhopte, B., Implementation of analytical hierarchical process to support decisions in employee performance appraisal (2012) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology and Security, 2 (2); Bitici, U.S., Suwignjo, P., Carrie, A.S., Strategy management through quantitative modelling of performance measurement system (2001) International Journal of Production Economics, 69 (1), pp. 15-22; Büyüközkan, G., Feyzioğlu, O., Nebol, E., Selection of the strategic alliance partner in logistics value chain (2008) International Journal of Production Economics, 113 (1); Caesar, L.A.Y., Performance excellence by transformational leadership in developing collectivistic culture for Indonesian companies (2016) Pertanika Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities, 24 (S), pp. 19-32; Cebi, F., Zeren, Z., A decision support model for location selection: Bank branch case (2008) Portland International Conference in Management of Engineering and Technology, 2008.

It also aimed to examine the relationship between EO and student inclination toward entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional survey was conducted targeting students at Indonesian universities. Using a pilot sample of 65 students, the authors developed their hypotheses. Thereafter, based on a sample of 381 students, the hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. Findings - The findings revealed that EO in the Indonesian context was a three- factor instrument consisting of the three dimensions: risk-taking, innovativeness and proactiveness. Moreover, the findings showed there is a positive relationship between EO and Entrepreneurial Intention (EI) among business students at Indonesian universities. Practical implications - Given the imperative need for universities to monitor and improve the entrepreneurial spirit among business students, this study can help business students to understand better regarding the business attitude they need to maintain, which can help them to improve proactive personality and formulate effective business strategies in the future. Originality/value - This paper came to be one of the first studies that attempted to assess the EO among business student in Indonesia using AMOS-SEM. Additionally, this study pioneered through drawing a factorial picture for EO in the Indonesian context.","Business studentsr; Entrepreneurial intention; Entrepreneurial orientation; Structural equation modeling",,,,,,"Amrullah, A., (2012) Mayoritas Lulusan Perguruan Tinggi tak Tertarik Jadi Wirausahawan, Kok Bisa?, , http://www.republika.co.id/berita/nasional/umum/12/03/03/m0aira-mayoritas-lulusan-perguruan-tinggi-tak-tertarik-jadi-wirausahawan-kok-bisa, Accessed 13 May 2015; (2015) Jumlah pengangguran terbuka Indonesia 7,24 juta, , http://nasional.kontan.co.id/news/jumlah-pengangguran-terbuka-indonesia-724-juta, Accessed 13 May 2015; (2015) Jumlah Pengusaha Indonesia Hanya 1,65 Persen, , http://www.republika.co.id/berita/nasional/umum/15/03/12/nl3i58-jumlah-pengusaha-indonesia-hanya-165-persen, Accessed 13 May 2015; (2013) Sekjen Kemenakertrans Muchtar LuthfiMembuka Forum Inkubator Bisnis Asia Pasific di Bandung, , http://bbppk-lembang.com/view_news_detail-152-sekjen-kemenakertrans-muchtar-luthfi-membuka-forum-inkubator-bisnis-asia-pasific-di-bandung.aspx, Accessed 25 May 2015; Astuti, D.A.W., (2009) Pengaruh Konteks Keluarga, Kerja, Pendidikan, Hambatan Dalam Memulai Bisnis, Dukungan Sosial, Nilai-Nilai Individualisme dan Kolektivisme Pada Intensi Berwirausaha, , working paper, Management Department, Universitas Sebelas Maret, 19 October; Begley, T.M., Boyd, D.P., Psychological Characteristics Associated with Performance in Entrepreneurial Firms and Smaller Businesses (1987) Journal of Business Venturing, 2 (1), pp. 79-93; Bentler, P., Comparative fit indexes in structural models (1990) Psychological Bulletin, 107 (2), pp. 238-246; Bentler, P., (2005) EQS 6 Structural Equations Program Manual, , Multivariate Software, Encino, CA; Bentler, P.M., Bonett, D.G., Significance tests and goodness of fit in the analysis of covariance structures (1980) Psychological Bulletin, 88 (3), pp. 588-606; Bolton, D.L., Lane, M.D., Individual entrepreneurial orientation: development of a measurement instrument (2012) Education + Training, 54 (2-3), pp. 219-233; Brislin, R.W., Translation and content analysis of oral and written materials (1980) Triandis: Handbook of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 2. , J.

The decision-making process is still analyzed manually, so that sometimes the decisions taken are also less appropriate, effective and efficient. The second problem is the lack of monitoring data cooperative process province that is too much, making it difficult for the analysis of dynamic information to be useful. Therefore the authors want to fix the system that runs by using digital dashboard management system supported by the modeling of system dynamics. In addition, the author also did the design of a system that can support the system. Design of this system is aimed to ease the experts, head, and the government to decide (DSS - Decision Support System) accurately effectively and efficiently, because in the system are raised alternative simulation in a description of the decision to be taken and the result from the decision.

Quality of service and the queue becomes very important to note the company to give satisfaction to the consumers especially in the business of cinema. Based on the same thing, which is by considering give satisfaction to the consumer, especially for consumers who have a hobby or a habit to watch at the cinema. Through the process of division of the questionnaire, the authors attempt to obtain and to know constraints and obstacles that occur in practice in the consumer getting a movie ticket. Through these activities, showed where the most common barrier is the number of queues that occur at the ticket counter, especially when watching in the days before the holiday or holidays. Consumers need to spend some time around 10 -15 minutes to get the opportunity to purchase tickets. That is why the author tries to provide alternatives that are expected to be one alternative to overcome the problems experienced, particularly to overcome the inconvenience of the queue which provides consumers. Over its growing information technology, many companies looked at the use of technology in providing satisfaction to consumers. This opportunity was be utilized by the authors in developing a system-based mobile ticket sales. Based on the survey, in Indonesia there are about 230 million mobile. Therefore, market and business opportunities in the mobile application area are very positive today. The author developed mobile cinema ticket sales system on Androids as the basis operating system.

However, creating game-based application is not easy, laborious, and requires good knowledge of the technology and programming skill. A typical game development process might take months or years to complete. In order to improve the usage of game technology, certain methods and tools have been invented, and the most popular one is game engine. However, learning to use game engine is not simple and takes time. Moreover, we still need programming skills and technical knowledge to use the game engine. This paper focuses on building a games authoring tool that can flexibly work with the existing game engines. We propose a novel plug-in architecture so that the authoring tool can use existing game engines. The advantage of this independent authoring system is that whenever one of the systems became obsolete, the developer can replace it without changing the whole system structure. In the experiments with the prototype system, the usage of the authoring tool shows significant process reduction compared to programming it manually. Furthermore, test on the users shows that the authoring tool can help non-technical users to develop 3D games easily.","Authoring tool; Game development; Game engine; User interface","Authoring systems; Authoring tool; Game development; Game engine; Game technologies; Non-technical users; Plug-ins; Process reductions; Programming skills; Prototype system; System structures; Computer software; Human computer interaction; IPTV; Software design; Technology; User interfaces; Animation",,,,,"(2007) Intel Glossary, , http://www.intel.com/products/glossary/body.htm, Game Engine, November Available: [Accessed November 14, 2007]; Eberly, D., (2005) 3D Game Engine Architecture, , United States of America: Morgan Kaufmann; (2007), http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net, SourceForge.net, October Available: [Accessed November 14, 2007]; (2007) Linux Filesystem Hierarchy, , http://tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/glossary.html, GUI, November Available: [Accessed November 15, 2007]; The 3D Game Makers Features, , http://t3dgm.thegamecreators.com/?f=features, Available: [Accessed August 31, 2007]; 3D Game Studio Features, , http://www.conitec.net/english/gstudio/3dgs7.htm, 3D Game Studio, Available: [Accessed August 31, 2007]; Unity3D Features, , http://unity3d.com/features/easy.html, Available: [Accessed August 31, 2007]; Dodge, B.J., George, M., Lessons Learned from the San Diego Microworlds Project (1997) Sixth Annual German-American Dialog, pp. 12-14","Kosala, R.; School of Computer Science, Jl.

The method is also applicable for determining thickness of concrete mattress required to withstand a certain height of waves. However, the method cannot predict deformation of concrete mattress subjected to repetitive wave loads. This paper elaborates the modeling of concrete mattress against the dynamic loading of waves by means of Finite Element Method (Plaxis 2D). It is found that the conventional method is adequate in determining thickness of concrete mattress required against wave height with a factor of safety against lift off in the order of 3.5. The movement of the concrete mattress can be assessed by simulating the wave loads as a concentrated sinusoidal dynamic load at the point of wave impact.","Concentrated sinusoidal dynamic load; Concrete mattress; Plaxis 2D; Shore protection","Concretes; Dynamic loads; Dynamics; Geotechnical engineering; Offshore structures; Safety factor; Shore protection; Slope stability; Soil mechanics; Structural loads; Conventional methods; Dynamic loadings; Factor of safety; Lift offs; Limit equilibrium methods; Sinusoidal dynamics; Wave heights; Wave impacts; Finite element method",,,,,"Breteler, M.K., Pilarczyk, K.W., Stoutjesdijk, T., (1998) Design of Alternative Revetments, , Delft, The Netherland; Brinkgreeve, R.B.J., Broere, W., Waterman, D., (2011) Plaxis 2D Version 2011 Manual, , Delf, the Netherlands; Pilarczyk, K.W., (1998) Dikes and Revetments, A.A., , Balkema, Rotterdam; Pilarczyk, K.W., (2003) Design of Revetments, Dutch Public Works Department (RWS), , Hydraulic Engineering Division, Delft, The Netherlands","Tjie-Liong, G.; Civil Engineering Department, Jalan Syahdan No. 9, Indonesia",,"Association for Disaster Prevention Research;et al.;Fukuoka Convention and Visitors Bureau;Japan Society for the Promotion of Science - Grant-in-Aid for Publication of Scientific Research Results;Kyushu Regional Planning Association;The Maeda Engineering Foundation","Asian Regional Conference on Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering","15th Asian Regional Conference on Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, ARC 2015","9 November 2015 through 13 November 2015",,121341,,,,,"English","Asian Reg.

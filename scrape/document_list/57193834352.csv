One of the popular algorithms in recommender systems is collaborative filtering. The fundamental assumption behind this algorithm is that other users' opinions can be filtered and accumulated in such a way as to provide a plausible prediction of the target user's preference. In this paper, we would like to develop a recommender system with big data of one e-commerce company and deliver the recommendations through a personalized email. To address this problem, we propose user-based collaboration filter based on company dataset and employ several similarity functions: Euclidean distance, Cosine, Pearson correlation and Tanimoto coefficient. The experimental results show that: (i) user responses are positive to the given recommendations based on user perception survey (ii) Tanimoto coefficient with 10 neighbors shows the best performance in the RMSE, precision and recall evaluation based on groundtruth dataset. © 2016 IEEE.","big data; personalized email; recommender systems; similarity functions; user-based collaborative filtering","Collaborative filtering; Commerce; Correlation methods; Electronic commerce; Electronic mail; Recommender systems; Security of data; Euclidean distance; Ground-truth dataset; Pearson correlation; Precision and recall; Similarity functions; Tanimoto coefficient; User perceptions; User's preferences; Big data",,,,,"Stiglitz, K., (2016) 70 Email Marketing Stats Every Marketer Should Know, , https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/emailmarketing/2016/01/70-email-marketing-stats-you-need-to-know/, Accessed July 2016; Hamirani, R., (2016) 5 Stats That Prove Businesses Must Personalize to Win Customers, , http://www.gigya.com/blog/5-stats-that-prove-businesses-must-personalize-to-win-customers/, Accessed 2016; Ekstrand, M.D., Riedl, J.T., Konstan, J.A., Collaborative filtering recommender systems (2010) Foundations and Trends in Human-Computer Interaction, 4 (2), pp. 81-173; Rajaraman, A., Leskovec, J., Ullman, J.D., (2012) Mining of Massive Datasets, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Arsan, T., Köksal, E., Bozkuş, Z., Comparison of collaborative filtering algorithms with various similarity measures for movie recommendation (2016) International Journal of Computer Science, Engineering and Applications (IJCSEA), 6 (3), pp. 1-20; Jannach, D., Zanker, M.F.A., Friedrich, G., (2011) Recommender Systems: An Introduction, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Owen, S., Anil, R., Dunning, T., Friedman, E., (2012) Mahout in Action, , New York: Manning Publications; Kumar, A., Gupta, S., Singh, S.K., Shukla, K.K., Comparison of various metrics used in collaborative filtering for recommendation system (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 Eighth International Conference on Contemporary Computing (IC3), , Noida, India",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 International Workshop on Big Data and Information Security, IWBIS 2016","18 October 2016 through 19 October 2016",,126774,,9781509034772,,,"English","Int.

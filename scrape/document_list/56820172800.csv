The service process has been utilized as a means to create competitive advantages by many industries. The main purpose of this research is to explore the perceptions of non-users of self-service technology towards the potential convenience and control benefits of using the technology and how they influence the non-users’ overall perceptions of speed of transaction, trust in the service provider and future intentions to use the self-service technology. Design/Methodology/Approach—Cronbach’s Alpha and Confirmatory Factorial Analyses were utilized to determine reliability and validity of the constructs. Multiple linear regression and mediation analysis were used to determine whether there were any relationships between the variables. Result and Conclusion—The result concluded that both the perceived control and perceived convenience act as mediators between the relationship of speed of transaction, and trust in a service provider to intention to use self-service technology. The findings also show that both perceived control and perceived convenience can directly influence an individual’s intention to use self-service technology. Practical Implications—The findings suggest that it is important for companies to offer self-service technology that can increase customer’s perception of control and convenience as those characteristics can affect the customers’ intention to use self-service technology in the future. It is also crucial to emphasize the speed of transaction and trust in the service provider as both factors have a mediating impact between customers’ perceived control and perceived convenience towards their intentions to use self-service technology. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

However, not many higher education institutions get the most benefit out of managing their knowledge. Most of these institutions are so busy delivering knowledge that they fail to capture the best practices in their knowledge delivery. The induction programme for new lecturers is therefore very important to improve the quality of teaching. In teaching, lecturers might be the subject matter experts but could lack knowledge related to teaching, such as theories of teaching and learning, classroom organization and management, development of curriculum and course content, and professionalism. This paper examines if knowledge management systems (KMS) can support the induction programmes for new lecturers in an academic setting at the Bina Nusantara University in Indonesia. Action research is used as the underlying methodology. Specifically, a 5-step canonical action research was used to conduct the study. Our findings post intervention suggests that most lecturers understand the importance of the induction programme and the lecturers have positive attitudes towards the implementation of KMS to support the induction programme.","Action research; Induction programme; Knowledge; Knowledge management systems",,,,,,"Baskerville, R.L., Wood-Harper, A.T., A critical perspective on action research as a method for information systems research (1996) Journal of Information Technology, 11, pp. 235-246; Bhatt, G.D., Knowledge management in organizations: Examining the interaction between technologies, techniques, and people (2001) Journal of Knowledge Management, 5 (1), pp. 68-75; Bullough Jr., R.V., Knowles, J.G., Crow, N.A., (1991) Emerging As A Teacher, , London: Routledge; Churchman, C.W., (1971) The Design of Inquiry Systems: Basic Concept of Systems and Organizations, , New York: Basic Books; Corbin, J., Strauss, A., (1990) Basics of Qualitative Research: Grounded Theory Procedures and Techniques, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, Inc; Davenport, T.H., Some principles of knowledge management (1996) Strategy & Business, 2, pp. 34-40; Davison, R., Martinsons, M.G., Kock, N., Principles of canonical action research (2004) Information Systems Journal, 14, pp. 65-86; Dorasamy, M., Kaliannan, M., Raman, M., Muthaiyah, S., Knowledge management systems for emergency managers: Malaysian perspective (2011) Proceedings of the International Conference on Semantic Technology and Information Retrieval, , Putrajaya, Selangor, Malaysia; Grant, R.M., Toward a knowledge-based theory of the firm (1996) Strategic Management Journal, 17, pp. 109-122; Harrison, J., McKeon, F., The formal and situated learning of beginning teacher educators in England: Identifying characteristics for successful induction in the transition from workplace in schools to workplace in higher education (2008) European Journal of Teacher Education, 31 (2), pp. 151-168; Hawkins, B., Libraries, knowledge management, and higher education in an electronic environment (2000) Proceedings of the American Library and Information Association Conference, , Chicago, Illinois; Ivancevich, J.M., (2004) Human Resource Management, , (9th Ed.).

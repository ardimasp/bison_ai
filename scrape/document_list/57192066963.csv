XYZ is a company which manufactures standard board. The inability to accurately predict the future leads to overstocking of commodities. This research aims to help PT. XYZ to determine the most accurate forecasting method. Using the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model, it will help the company with optimal inventory management. The results show that the most accurate forecasting is Linear Regression method and the optimal order quantity of stucco is 137,805.3 kg, water is 761.58 kl, paper pulp is 64,752,12 kg, and starch is 37,600.91 kg. In conclusion, if the company adopts this model, its overall yearly profit will increase from Rp. 241.735.285.000,-to Rp. 255.315.500.000,-an increase of about 6%.","Economic Order Quantity Inventory Control Reorder Point; Forecasting",,,,,,"Candra, S., Sarjono, H., Forecasting for inventory control (2012) Journal of Supply Chain Management, 6 (1), pp. 1-14; Gozali, L., Andres, A., Handika, R., Usulan penentuan teknik lot sizing terbaik dengan minimasi biaya dalam perencanaan dan pengendalian kebutuhan canvas EP 200 conveyor belt di PT.

Without the correct area of the face to be detected and recognized, then implemented face recognition can be inefficient and wasting the valuable areas that can be useful as inputs in face recognition networks. Therefore, there are many types of research in this topic using various face dataset benchmark like tested on FDDB and WIDER Face. WIDER Face offering a challenging dataset with various of the pose, scale, occlusion along with many annotated tiny faces. In this WIDER Face benchmark, S3FD offering a faster detector with relatively good accuracy inspired by anchor-based SSD and RPN where the top accuracy detectors in WIDER Face implemented using Region-based CNN. Region-based DSFD offering good accuracy and listed on top-accuracy detectors, but unable counted as a real-time detector in our testing process. In this paper, we propose a faster face detector model with relatively good accuracy in the WIDER Face benchmark using optimized 9 clusters of anchor boxes in the Yolov3 framework. These anchor boxes are optimized using K-Mean clustering from the WIDER Face training dataset in order to make better-matched anchor boxes during the training-validation process to detect various faces, especially for tiny faces. This paper shows relatively good competitiveness of our Yolov3 face detector model in terms of accuracy and speed on the WIDER Face datasets benchmark. We also tested our model in a real-case situation for detecting students inside the classroom and show the capability of real-time face detector with correct face detections during the real case implementation. © 2019 SERSC.","Convolutional neural networks; Real-case face detection; Real-time face detector; Wider face dataset; Yolov3",,,,,"Binus University","The authors wish to thank Bina Nusantara University to support this paper publication.

The method used was a series of challenges with each challenge designed to convey a particular message and objective to promote a healthy environment. Results showed that this approach attracted the participation of 181 (90%) branch offices with 69 branch offices (38%) participated in all challenges. A total of 2,530 tweets produced more than 15 million impressions in the social media platform. A new perspective from the organisation in using social media to promote the brand and internal activities started to develop. In conclusion, gamification can be used to optimise a corporate employee engagement program not only to achieve its internal objective but also to push for an active health promotion program for the community. These activities can boost positive brand awareness. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Brand awareness; Employee; Gamification; Health promotion; Internal engagement program; Social media",,,,,,,"Bruner, J.S., The act of discovery (1961) Harvard Educational Review, 31, pp. 21-32; Buttenheim, A.M., Paz-Soldan, V., Barbu, C., Skovira, C., Calderón, J.Q., Riveros, L.M.M., Levy, M.Z., Is participation contagious?

In recent years there have been several studies that have used games, especially computer-based ones to improve the executive function of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) especially in working memory improvements. There are still several obstacles in using computer-based games that have been circulating today in Indonesia. The aim of this research is to develop and create a prototype game that can be used to improve working memory of children with ADHD using Bahasa Indonesia. The prototype game application is a race game with matching colors and memory work tasks; developed using Construct2. Players will play as a driver, delivering certain fruits to specific homes with different colors. The game also included visuospatial tasks such as remembering the objects. For performance test, CPU utilization, average FPS and image memory usage has been tested in several browsers. In conclusion, the performance tests results show that the first type of the prototype game is good enough to be played in desktop or laptop. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Software prototyping; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; CPU utilization; Executive function; Game for children; Image memory; Performance tests; Work task; Working memory; Computer games",,,,,,"https://newzoo.com/about, Newzoo [Internet].

Most of these games are specifically designed to focus on certain scenarios and concepts. For example, the original beer distribution game focuses on a single product supply chain without considering capacity and process reliability into account. This creates challenges for extending the games to cover other concepts in SCM. To tackle this problem, we propose a board game, titled ThinkLog, as a face-to-face extendable framework to facilitate learning in SCM. It can be extended to generate different scenarios for various concepts in SCM without changing the basic game structure. Using this principle, we have extended the basic version of ThinkLog to two other scenarios, namely: humanitarian logistics and urban logistics, by simply modifying the rule of the game. Each scenario would have different learning objectives embedded in the gameplay. The game is also complemented with a computer-based application (digital application) to enhance the overall learning experience and collect relevant data (data gathering) during a game session. These three scenarios have been evaluated on four-interactive sessions with government officials and policy- makers in Indonesia. Each session has been consistent in its acceptance of the game as a tool to facilitate learning in SCM, regardless of the scenarios that we played. Our learning objective evaluation also shows that the game is effective in deepening the players' understanding of SCM concepts. © 2018 Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems.All right reserved.","Board game; Expandable framework; Facilitate learning; Game-based learning; Supply chain management",,,,,,"The work is part of solutions/case studies developed as part of “Temasek Foundation International – National University of Singapore Urban Transportation Management Programme in Indonesia” programme.

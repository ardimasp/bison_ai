The focus is to discover how communication used by Radio Taiwan International (RTI) for Indonesian citizen can build a good image for governments. The result of this study shows: First, image building through radio broadcasting for governments can be done through the role of radio as a medium of communication between the government and local communities. Second, the method of delivering the message for female radio listeners is a two-way communication in which the broadcaster has to prepare direct conversation with the listeners or provide time to speak directly as a friend in the real world. Third, radio programmes that are ethnically coloured are an effective form of radio programme for citizens abroad that supports image building. The conclusion of this study is that image building through radio can be done for female Indonesian citizens in Taiwan because radio as a medium of socialisation works as two-way communication and it can be ethnically coloured. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Image building; Indonesian; Radio Taiwan International",,,,,,"Anderson, P.J., Egglestone, P., The development of effective quality measures relevant to the future practice of BBC news journalism online (2012) Journalism Sage Journal, 13 (7), pp. 923-941; (2012) Kian Banyak Wanita Indonesia Jadi Pengantin Asing di Taiwan, , http://www.antaranews.com/berita/1141877923/kian-banyak-wanita-indonesia-jadi-pengantin-asing-di-taiwan, Retrieved December 21, 2012, from; Conway, B., Cahill, L.M., Corcoran, M.P., The 'miracle' of Fatima: Media framing and the regeneration of a Dublin housing estate (2012) Journalism Sage Journals, 13 (5), pp. 551-571; Field, S., (2009) Carrer Opportunities in Radio, , New York: Infobase Publishing; (2012) Rangkaian Kunjungan Menteri Tenaga Kerja Dan Transmigrasi Dan Rombongan Ke Taiwan Untuk Peningkatan Kesejahteraan TKI, , http://kdei-taipei.org/id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=411:rangkaian-kunjungan-menteri-tenaga-kerja-dan-transmigrasi-dan-rombongan-ke-taiwan-untuk-peningkatan-kesejahteraan-tki&catid=34:berita&Itemid=55, Retrieved December 12, 2012, from; Ma, E.K., Compressed modernity in south China (2010) Global Media and Communication, 8 (3), pp. 289-308; (2001) Jurnalistik Radio: Menata Profesionalisme Reporter Dan Penyiar, , Masduki.

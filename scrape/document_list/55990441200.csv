The modification of FPPD and LSB Substitution is located at the pixel block that is going to be used to insert the secret message. The pixel block being used is 2x2. The LSB Substitution method is a method to insert the data by changing the last bit of the pixel into the byte of the hidden message. FPPD uses data blocks and calculates the capacity of each blocks, then inserts the hidden message in accordance to the capacity of each blocks. The development of this method is expected to increase the capacity of the plain text without reducing the quality of the data produced.

The emerging deep learning techniques in the last decade coupled and the wide availability of massive weather observation data have motivated many researches to explore hidden hierarchical pattern in the large volume of weather dataset for weather forecasting. The purposes of this research are to build a robust and adaptive statistical model for forecasting univariate weather variable in Indonesian airport area and to explore the effect of intermediate weather variable related to accuracy prediction using single layer Long Short Memory Model (LSTM) model and multi layers LSTM model. The proposed forecasting model is an extension of LSTM model by adding intermediate variable signal into LSTM memory block. The premise is that two highly related patterns in input dataset will rectify the input patterns so make it easier for the model to learn and recognize the pattern from the training dataset. In an effort to achieve a robust model for learning and recognizing weather pattern, this research will also explore various architectures such as single layer LSTM and Multiple Layer LSTM (4 layers LSTM). The dataset is weather variable data collected by Weather Underground at Hang Nadim Indonesia airport. This research used visibility as predicted data and temperature, pressure, humidity, dew point as intermediates data. The best model of LSTM in this experiment is multiple layers LSTM and the best intermediate data is pressure variable. Using the pressure variable this model has gained the validation accuracy 0.8060 and RMSE 0.0775. © 2018 The Authors.

One of the important weather data in aviation is visibility. Visibility is an important factor in all phases of flight, especially when the aircraft is maneuvering on or close to the ground, i.e., during taxi-out, takeoff and initial climb, approach and landing and taxi-in. The aim of these study is to analyze intermediate variables and do the comparison of visibility forecasting by using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Model. This paper proposes ARIMA model and LSTM model for forecasting visibility at Hang Nadim Airport, Batam Indonesia using one variable weather data as predictor such as visibility and combine with another variable weather data as moderating variables such as temperature, dew point and humidity. The models were tested using weather time series data at Hang Nadim Airport, Batam Indonesia. This research compares the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) resulted by LTSM model with the RMSE resulted by ARIMA model. The results of this experiment show that LSTM model with/or without intermediate variable has better performance than ARIMA Model. © 2018 Afan Galih Salman, Yaya Heryadi, Edi Abdurahman and Wayan Suparta.","Autoregressive integrated moving average; Long Short-Term Memory; Root mean square error; Visibility; Weather forecasting",,,,,"Binus University","This research is supported by Doctoral of Computer Science, Bina Nusantara University.","Afshin, S., Fahmi, H., Alizadeh, A., Kaveh, F., Long term rainfall forecasting by integrated artificial neural network-fuzzy logic-wavelet model in Karoon basin (2011) Scientific Res.

In swarm robot systems, each robot must cooperate with other robots in order to perform a given task. The main obstacle in swarm robot research is the cost of making robots. Building one robot with limited capabilities commonly has to spend substantial amount of money and certainly making robots for intelligent systems research need much more investment. In this paper, we would like to present the development of affordable mobile robot, but also having powerful capabilities and intelligence. The mobile robot is specifically designed and made to be used as a stand-alone or in swarm robot systems. It is essential that the mobile robot has learning ability to adapt the dynamic environments. Furthermore, for swarm robot systems, each mobile robot must be able to communicate with other robots in order to coordinate each other. In our research, we used differential drive model for mobile robot locomotion and then apply the model through Android smartphone based controller. The mobile robot was constructed by using two actuators on the right and left side, and one castor wheel which has no steering system and can move freely. The differences velocity between left and right actuators determines the direction and final position of the mobile robot. The angular velocity of two main actuators is set by Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) parameter in IOIO board microcontroller. In our experiment, we showed that the capability of our robot in performing several movement tasks. We are sure that Android based robotic platforms are ideal candidates for affordable robotics for swarm robot system research. © 2017 The Authors.

By looking at these requirements, a safer way to communicate, such as Cryptography, has been developed. However, the result of this method is not sufficient, because it still risk from the interception of the sent data, caused by cryptography which only hides the data resulting the packaging to be suspicious and draw attention of the hijackers. Therefore, Steganography then developed in which not only hides the content, but also deceptive hijackers with packaging that is not suspicious. In this paper, we discuss the design of steganography which is applied in mobile devices (e.g. mobile phone) using the BPCS (Bit-Plane Complexity Segmentation) by hiding text message into the media reservoir of JPEG data types images. When using this method the message hiding capacity is larger than any other method, up to 40% of the image container. The simulation result reconstructed images which is measured by an objective assessment parameters, based on the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio PSNR, with efficient value obtained on average is 74.3294 dB which is well worth the image quality. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Cryptography; Mobile device; PSNR; Steganography",,,,,,,"Cachin, C., (2005) Digital Steganography, , http://www.zurich.ibm.com/~cca/papers/encyc.pdf, Switzerland, Accessed on 30 December 2011; Bucklin, T., Davidson, C., Newman, D., Sergaves, J., Taylor, D., (2009) PSNR Quality Analysis Methodology, , http://techblog.cineform.com/, April 18, Accessed pada 20 Januari 2012; Chamorro, A.G.H., Miyatake, M.N., A new methodology of image steganalysis including for jpeg steganography (2010) Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics Conference (CERMA); Chen, Y.H., Huang, H.C., A copyright information embedding system for android platform (2011) Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing; Kawaguchi, E., (1999) A Research on Bit-Plane Complexity Segmentation Based Steganography, , Kyushu Institute of Technology; Kawaguchi, E., Eason, Richard.O., (1998) Principle and Applications of BPCS Steganography, , http://www.ece.umaine.edu/~eason/steg/SPIE98.pdf, Kitakyushu, Japan: Kyushu Institue of Technology.

This study used the stock returns data for 60 days around 50 split events of publicly traded stock on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2010 to 2015. This study found an anomaly pattern of stock prices with the ex-date as the peak and a positive average return that could not be explained by the general market movement. The cross-sectional regression of the conservative capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and three other factors failed in explaining the ex-date return anomalies. The results of the empirical model indicate that ex-date return anomalies were not related to a firm’s operating performance but were strongly related to the split factor, weakly related to trading volume, and also weakly related to the market value. Overall, these findings support the trading range/liquidity hypothesis. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Event study; Market reaction; Stock split",,,,,"Binus University","The authors would like to thank the Management Department of the Binus Business School that always gives full support in areas of research and publication, along with thanks to the Research Technological Transfer Office Department of Binus University that provided the funding for conference registration and travel accommodations.","Brennan, M.

Employees experience engaged condition when they have a leader with a supportive leadership style. The aim of the study is to find the role of the leadership style in generating work engagement to volunteers of humanity organization. The research method is by using Neuro-research. The calibration of the scoring sheet is by using Principle Component Avis approach through Varimax iteration (ratation) in which each reliability index ω is 0.781 and 0.873. Hypotheses test is conducted by using linear regression and classification regression tree (biner segmentation). The result of the research shows that (1)volunteers of humanity organization tend to sometimes engaged significantly at α< 0.05, (2) volunteers of humanity organization has the condition of leadership which tends to have an inspirational motivation significantly at α< 0.05, (3) there is an influence of leadership style towards work engagement of volunteers in humanity organization significantly at α< 0.01, and (4) inspirational motivation is a kind of leadership style which is the strongest in determining the work engagement of volunteers in the humanity organization significantly at α< 0.05 while to generate inspirational motivation is highly determined by improving the role of idealized influence (behavior) and contingent reward. Thus, based on the study is recommended to do some intervention for volunteers of humanity organization in order to increase the engagement by improving the leaders' self ability to be able to become an aspirator and motivator for humanity acts. © Serials Publications.","Neuroresearch; Trasformational Leadership; Work Engagement",,,,,,,"Alshemmeri, F., Putih, A., Siraj, S., Khan, A., Abdallah, N., Art Ability and Academic Achievement in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: Role of Age and Sex (2011) New Educational Review, 26 (4), pp. 238-247; Bass, B.M., From transactional to transformational leadership - Learning to share the vision.pdf (1991) Organizational Dynamics; Bass, B.M., Waldman, D.A., Avolio, B.J., Bebb, M., Transformational leadership and the falling dominoes effect (1987) Group & Organization Management, 12 (1), p. 73; Breevaart, K., Bakker, A., Hetland, J., Demerouti, E., Olsen, O.K., Espevik, R., Daily transactional and transformational leadership and daily employee engagement (2014) Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 87 (1), pp. 138-157; Covey, S., The Transformational leadership report (2007) Transformational Leadership Journal, pp. 1-19; Dulagil, A., The relationship of employee engagement and wellbeing to organisational and student outcomes (2012) SBS HDR Student Conference, p. 1; Dvir, T., Eden, D., Avolio, B.J., Shamir, B., Impact of transformational leadership on follower development and performance: A field experiment (2002) Academy of Management Journal, 45 (4), pp. 735-744; Fios, F., Sasmoko, Gea, A.A., Neuro-Research Method: A Synthesis between Hermeneutics and Positivism (2016) Advanced Science Letters, 22 (9), pp. 2202-2206. , https://doi.org/10.1166/asl.2016.7565; Ghafoor, A., Qureshi, T.M., Khan, M.A., Hijazi, S.T., Transformational leadership, employee engagement and performance: Mediating effect of psychological ownership (2011) African Journal of Business Management, 5 (17), pp. 7391-7403. , https://doi.org/10.5897/AJBM11.126; Grant, A.M., Leading with meaning: Beneficiary contact, prosocial impact, and the performance effects of transformational leadership (2012) Academy of Management Journal, 55 (2), pp. 458-476; Hakanen, J.J., Schaufeli, W.B., Do burnout and work engagement predict depressive symptoms and life satisfaction?

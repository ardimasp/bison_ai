This can lead to a loss, especially when applied in the industrial world. The purpose of this research is to fix an illumination factor, particularly the shadow factor on an image that will be detected by combining two methods, namely adaptive single scale retinex and shadow removal. Smoothing from retinex and shadow removal process are performed after an image is captured. Accuracy of object detection obtained is 95.45%, using experimental image detection program and random sampling method from 22 images of two datasets used in this study. Namely “Shadow Removal Online Dataset and Benchmark for Variable Scene Categories” and “Klik BCA” which obtained from the simulation process. This method can be applied to real time conditions, where the speed of the process is stable and fast enough such that it can be applied into industrial companies to help their quality control. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Illumination; Image processing; Shadow detection","Database systems; Lighting; Object detection; Object recognition; Adaptive single-scale retinex; Image detection; Industrial companies; Light intensity; Random sampling method; Scene categories; Shadow detections; Simulation process; Image processing",,,,,,"Andreopoulos, A., Tsotsos, J.K., 50 years of object recognition: Directions forward (2013) Comput.

Based on investigation, k-means is also effective to solve the clustering problem specially in fast convergence. This paper combines two algorithms, cuckoo search algorithm and k-means algorithm in clustering problem called FCSA. Cuckoo search is used to build the robust initialization, while K-means is used to accelerate by building the solutions.

The problem is many sensor node for indoor air quality should not always send data to server in normal situation. It could spend power consumption and the data would send it periodically. Although the data send periodically, the sensor must handle emergency situation like fire. The results show that with controlled transmission interval not only spend power consumption but the device also good respond in emergency situation and user could monitor air quality remotely via web application. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

With the potential of cultural diversity in Java, creative economic activities on this island need the development. The local wisdom and cultural events are reflecting the creativity of the community and can provide economic value to the community. The physical quality of creative economic spaces that can become generators in some cultural tourism areas does not have functional quality space. To support the preservation of cultural heritage and the development of superior cultural tourism areas, the quality of an excellent creative economic space is necessary. The aim of this study is to identify physical quality of space for creative economic activities or events. The method of this study used a qualitative descriptive method. Results of this study provide an overview that cultural village in Semarang and Banyuwangi have five potential creative economic activities: traditional architecture, culinary, crafts, music, and performing arts. The physical quality of these two creative economic spaces is still limited because of the limited economic capacity of the community in providing the spaces. They are shaping and realizing space with utilizes natural conditions (green open spaces or spaces among tall trees) and local material (bamboo). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Historic preservation; Tourism; Cultural diversity; Cultural events; Cultural heritages; Economic activities; Economic capacity; Natural conditions; Physical quality; Traditional architecture; Economic analysis",,,,"Kementerian Riset Teknologi Dan Pendidikan Tinggi Republik Indonesia

The results showed that the dominant physical changes were performed by occupants: (1) physical changes that are related to the aesthetic reasons and improving the quality of dwelling unit (aesthetical and physical adjustment); (2) physical changes that are related to the fulfillment of function of dwelling unit in low cost flats (functional adjustment).

The results showed that physical changes which happened in low cost flats are aesthetic (residence paint color change), or improvement of physical quality of residential unit (change of building material), become dominant aspects done by residents in four rusuna. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Building materials; Housing; Color changes; Indonesia; Low cost housing; Low costs; Low incomes; Physical changes; Physical quality; Urban areas; Costs",,,,,,"Bahri, S., Rumah susun sebagai bentuk budaya bermukim masyarakat modern (2005) Jurnal Sistem Teknik Industri, 6, pp. 97-102; Nurdiani, N., Adjustment and self-help approach for improving housing unit quality in multi-storey housing (2012) Applied Mechanics and Materials, 174-177, pp. 3463-3466; Mohit, M.A., Ibrahim, M., Rashid, Y.R., Assessment of residential satisfaction in newly designed public low-cost housing in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia (2010) Habitat International, 34 (1), pp. 18-27; Awanyo, L., Meeting housing-space demand through in situ housing adjustments in the greater Accra metropolitan area Ghana (2009) Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy, 27 (2), pp. 302-318; Sinai, I., Moving or improving: Housing adjusment choice in Kumasi Ghana (2001) Housing Studies, 16 (1), pp. 97-114","Nurdiani, N.; Lect., Indonesia; email: nnurdiani@binus.edu",,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","2017 5th International Conference on Mechanical Engineering, Materials Science and Civil Engineering, ICMEMSCE 2017","15 December 2017 through 16 December 2017",,135937,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The easy readiness and completeness of information in a drawing determine the quality and timeliness of a project. An incomplete engineering drawing is difficult to read by foreman or craftsman, and the risk of misunderstanding of the drawing will cost expensive and have potential risk to create many bad implications in the project. Unfortunately, the knowledge and skill of drawing technique are often not completely mastered by most students. On the other hand, according to the regional development situation in architectural and construction issue, the drawing standards must be fully utilized in international standards in order to facilitate cooperative work involving workers and engineers from these region countries. This research will be described some errors that often made by students and of international drafting symbols that supposed to be well used by students and then insert multi-media resources as digital enrichment material that supposed to be used as an additional material. The goal of this study will be to examine how multi-media is employed to positively impact student learning in a Building Technology course. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Architecture student; building technology course; design development drawing; green technology; technical drawing","Architecture; Cost engineering; Curricula; E-learning; Education; Engineering education; Environmental technology; Multimedia systems; Product design; Regional planning; Building technologies; Cooperative works; Design development; Engineering drawing; Green technology; International standards; Regional development; Technical drawing; Students",,,,,,"Diamond, R.M., (1989) Designing and Improving Courses and Curricula in Higher Education, , (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass); Barnes, K., Marateo, R.C., Ferris, S.P., Teaching and Learning with the Net Generation (2007) Journal of Online Education; Dale, E., (1969) Audio-Visual Methods in Teaching, p. 108. , 3 (New York: Holt Rinehart and Winston); Douglas, W., (1999) Drafting Symbol Sourcebook, , (New York: McGraw-Hill)","Wizaka, W.; Architecture Department, Indonesia; email: wwizaka@binus.ac.id","Kasih T.P.","","Institute of Physics Publishing","International Conference on Eco Engineering Development 2017, ICEED 2017","14 November 2017 through 15 November 2017",,133427,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

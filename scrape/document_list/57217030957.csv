It is like a summary to reflect the quality of all element inside a movie. People prefer to use rating as reference to decide before deciding to watch a movie or not. It is important to predict movie rating before it is released to maintain the objectivity of the movie rating. Many existing researches failed to address this problem because they used the post-release elements such as social media comments to predict movie rating. The other problem is the predicted rating is not intended for general people. Several researches used collaborative filtering, however the rating found was intended for specific people. To address limitations from previous researches, this study used historical values of the movie as features. Historical values could be generated from pre-released elements from the movie, it was created from relation between movie which based on movie similar attributes such as actor, director, genres, content rating, and production companies. By using historical values, objective prediction can be made even before the movie released. The proposed method was intended to make more accurate and general prediction for movie rating. In this study, usage of historical features and convolutional neural network (CNN) as model showed promising result. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

This study focused on optimizing the one-dimension CNN that we used on our previous study. Several studies were conducted to proposed technique to optimize DNN. We combined several optimization techniques such as regularization, activation function, optimizer, loss function and batch normalization to optimized CNN. The implementation of several techniques such as ReLU, dropout, Adam, L2 weight regularizer and batch normalization proved to give performance boost in our CNN model. After hyperparameter tuning is completed, our CNN model proved to give promising result by having the best performance compared to other machine learning models such as SVR and ANN. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

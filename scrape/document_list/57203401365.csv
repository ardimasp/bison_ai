The research strategies used include the associative quantitative method where the data collection method consists of a survey distributed to 154 Export-Oriented SMEs respondents while data analysis technique incorporates path analysis using double regression method. The results show that the internationalisation process has a mediating effect on knowledge management and the dynamic capabilities that affect SMEs export performance. Knowledge management and dynamic capabilities have a direct impact on SMEs export performance. The value of mediating effect is lower than its direct effect, showing that the internationalisation process enhances the effect of knowledge management and dynamic capabilities towards SMEs export performance. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Dynamic capabilities; Export performance; Internationalisation process; Knowledge management; Mediating effect",,,,,,"Management influences on export performance: A review of the empirical literature 1978-1988 (1989) International Marketing Review, 6 (4), pp. 7-26; Strategi produk untuk mengatasi hambatan ekspor UKM industry kerajinan Indonesia (2015) Jurnal Manajemen & Bisnis Sriwijaya, 13 (1), pp. 39-53; Knowledge management and the innovation performance in a high-tech SMEs industry (2011) International Small Business Journal, pp. 1-18; Internationalization of small-and medium-sized enterprises: A multi case study (2010) European Business Review, 22 (6), pp. 608-623; International new ventures: Rapid internationalization across different industry contexts' (2014) European Business Review, 26 (5), pp. 390-405. , https://doi.org/10.1108/EBR-05-2014-0040; Determinants and measures of export performance-comprehensive literature review (2014) Journal of Contemporary Economic and Business Issues, 1 (1), pp. 63-74; Export market-oriented behaviour and export performance: Quadratic and moderating effects under differing degrees of market dynamism and internationalization (2009) Journal of International Marketing, 17 (4), pp. 71-89; 29 Tantangan Internasionalisasi Ukm Di Indonesia Dalam Menghadapi Masyarakat Ekonomi (2015) Journal Kajian, 27 (9), pp. 129-144; Marketing strategy-performance relationship: An investigation of the empirical link in export market ventures (1994) Journal of Marketing, 58, pp. 1-21; The Determinants of Export Performance: A Review of the Literature 2006-2014 (2016) International Marketing Review, 33 (5), pp. 626-670; Information, knowledge and collaboration management in the internationalisation of SMEs: A systematic literature review (2016) International Journal of Information Management, 36 (4), pp. 557-569; The emergence, advance and future of international entrepreneurship research: An introduction to the special forum (2011) Journal of Business Venturing, 26 (6), pp. 625-631; Institutional theory and institutional change: Introduction to the special research forum (2002) The Academy of Management Journal, 45 (1), pp. 43-56; Viewpoint-Export Performance Measurement: Reflective Versus Formative I˙ndicators (1999) International Marketing Review, 16 (6), pp. 444-457; Knowledge management in SMEs: A literature review (2012) Journal of Knowledge Management, 16 (6), pp. 879-903; Dynamic capabilities and Knowledge Management: An integrative role for learning?

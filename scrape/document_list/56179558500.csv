However since this technology is still new, there are still many potentials in the game development area that are not explored yet. This paper tries to uncover the potential of integrating physics frameworks with WebGL technology in a game engine for developing 2D or 3D games. Specifically we integrated three open source physics frameworks: Bullet, Cannon, and JigLib into a WebGL-based game engine. Using experiment, we assessed these frameworks in terms of their correctness or accuracy, performance, completeness and compatibility. The results show that it is possible to integrate open source physics frameworks into a WebGLbased game engine, and Bullet is the best physics framework to be integrated into the WebGL-based game engine. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,"Schultheiss, D., (2007) Long-term Motivations to Play MMOGs: A Longitudinal Study on Motivations, Experience and Behavior, p. 344. , DiGRA; (2010) Web Browser Plugin Market Share / Global Usage, , Statowl.com,.

This recommendation also helps the consumer gets the preference object. One of the popular objects in the recommendation is anime film. In this case, we conduct research to recommend anime films based on ratings of previously watched films. Collaborative filtering is a technique that consists of calculating similarities, predictions, and recommendations. This study is taken from dataset Kaggle which consists of 73,516 users and 12,294 anime. A user's history will be matched with the whole user's history with alternating least squares (ALS) method. The anime will be recommended based on that results. This method is expected to help millions of users find the desired anime. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","anime; collaborative filtering; prediction; Recommendation technique","Collaborative filtering; Least squares approximations; Alternating least squares; Calculating similarities; Collaborative recommendation system; Recommender systems",,,,,"Vie, J.J., Yger, F., Lahfa, R., Clement, B., Cocchi, K., Chalumeau, T., Kashima, H., Using posters to recommend anime and mangas in a cold-start scenario (2017) IEEE 14th IAPR International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 3, pp. 21-26; Wang, X., Xu, Z., Xia, X., Mao, C., Computing user similarity by combining simrank++ and cosine similarities to improve collaborative filtering (2017) IEEE 14th Web Information Systems and Applications Conference (WISA), pp. 205-210; Dev, A.V., Mohan, A., Recommendation system for big data applications based on set similarity of user preferences (2016) IEEE International Conference on Next Generation Intelligent Systems (ICNGIS), pp. 1-6; Kumar, M., Yadav, D.K., Singh, A., Gupta, V.K., A movie recommender system: Movrec (2015) International Journal of Computer Applications, 124; Verstrepen, K., Goethals, B., Unifying nearest neighbors collaborative filtering (2014) Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pp. 177-184; Ma, S., Ahmad, Z., Arefin, M.S., Hossain, M.R., A user rating-based collaborative filtering approach to predict movie preferences (2017) IEEE 3rd International Conference on Electrical Information and Communication Technology (EICT), pp. 1-5; Wu, C.M., Garg, D., Bhandary, U., A Collaborative Filtering Recommender System with Randomized Learning Rate and Regularized Parameter (2018) IEEE 9th Int.

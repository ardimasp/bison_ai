The method of this MOOC was covered in Horton’s book E-Learning by Design, and the analysis method will use Unified Process (UP). What was gained from this analysis and development is an MOOC site that can be used to deliver introductory courses in Information System to the general public for free and can be accessed easily, be it from computer or mobile devices. What can be concluded from this development are courses in Information System (IS) area to decide whether or not potential students want to pursue an education in the field, students mostly turn to books, internet searches, and non-MOOC online courses. This MOOC provides a platform where they can learn from IS lecturers so that they do not have to learn unassisted, which gives them a stronger understanding of the basics of IS to make an informed decision on pursuing an education in IS. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Development; E-learning; Information system; Online course","Curricula; Education; Information systems; Mobile devices; Search engines; Students; Teaching; Case study approach; Development; Informed decision; Internet searches; Introductory course; Massive open online course; Online course; University course; E-learning",,,,,"Gundry, J., (2003) How Flexible is E-Learning?

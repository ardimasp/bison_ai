Many methods for face recognition such as holistic learning, the use of local features, shallow learning and deep learning, some methods are susceptible to variations in pose change, illumination, expression and age variation. State of the art of face recognition today is a deep learning technique that delivers high accuracy. In this paper author replicate an face recognition using deep learning architecture called OpenFace Convolutional Neural Network. In this research author make variation on the size of image, color dept and age, and see how that factor impact on accuracy of face recognition in that architecture. As the result from the research, the accuracy of a model depends on the image size, color depth, and age variation, but in OpenFace CNN that recognition still provides fairly good accuracy when reducing the size of image and color depth, as long as the image can still be detected on the landmark facial, so the alignment process can be done on the face image. © 2018 IEEE.","Age variant; Color Depth; Convolutional Neural Network; Face Recognition; Image Size","Color; Convolution; Deep learning; Network architecture; Neural networks; Age variant; Biometric authentication; Color depth; Convolution neural network; Convolutional neural network; Image Size; Learning architectures; Learning techniques; Face recognition",,,,,,"Turk, M., Pentland, A., Eigenfaces for recognition (1991) J.

This step will ensures yours developed system or software has high quality in functionality or non-functionality needs. Several methods can be used to evaluate the Augmented Reality application: subjective measurement using human perception or objective measure from observation, or evaluation by expert through cognitive walkthrough, heuristic evaluation, lab observation, and questionnaire. An evaluation is more valid if evaluation was done in multiple methods in order to confirm the result of evaluation. © 2017 IEEE.","expert evaluation; objective measurement; Subjective measurement","Augmented reality; Information management; Testing; Augmented reality applications; Cognitive walkthrough; Expert evaluation; Heuristic evaluation; Objective measure; Objective measurement; Subjective measurements; Usability testing methods; Heuristic methods",,,,,,"Fenton, N., Bieman, J., (2014) Software Metrics A Rigorous and Practical Approach, , 3rd ed.

This work is important for a number of reasons: the increasing number of the Internet users across the globe, the increasing number of social media, increasing in the number and types of crime on the Internet, and the crime of sexual abuse in children impacts both physically and physiologically. Online grooming is the most reported suspected Internet activities in 2009-2010 according to Child Exploitation and Online Protection, which is a part of the UK's Home Office Serious Organized Crime agency. Around 160 online script conversations are analyzed to determine characteristics of a grooming conversation. Those scripts are obtained randomly from http://www.perverted-justice.com and www.literotika.com. The characteristics are divided into 20 types. The scripts are divided into two sets: 100 scripts for the training set and 59 scripts for the testing set. As the results, five most relevant grooming characteristics are identified from the paired t-test, and a logistic model is established on this basis. The model is evaluated using the testing data set, and the results show that the model has relatively good performance with 95% accuracy, 96% true positive, 4% false positive, 93% true negative, and 7% false negative. © 2015 The Authors.

The method that be used in this research is by distributing questionnaires to the respondents and the data obtained were processed quantitatively with path analysis. The results showed that the leadership of the lecturer did not have significant influence, because it only accounted for 12.1%, while the effect of organizational culture on the students' SPIRIT character development is also not significant, which amounted to 6.4%. It can be concluded that the leadership and organizational culture have no significant effect on the students' SPIRIT character development. So, it is very necessary to develop leadership and organizational culture in order to give significant effect to the students' SPIRIT character building. © 2017 IEEE.","Culture organization; Leadership; SPIRIT character building","Regression analysis; Surveys; Leadership; Long-term goals; Organizational cultures; Path analysis; Students",,,,"Binus University","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported in part by Bina Nusantara University under BINUS Research Grant.","Colquitt, J., Jeffrey, A.L., Wesson, M., (2011) Organizational Behavior: Improving Performance and Commitment in the Workplace, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Dalmeri, (2016) SPIRIT Character in Islam Perspective, , Jakarta: Personal Paper; Debra, L.N., Quick, J.C., (2006) Organizational Behavior: Foundations, Realities, and Challenges, , South Western: Thomson; Huang, M., (2016) SPIRIT Character in Confucianism Perspective, , Jakarta: Personal Paper; Gibson, J.L., Ivanicevich, J.M., Donnelly, J.H., Konopaske, R., (2009) Organizations, Behavior, Structure, Processes, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Kadir, S., (2010) Jakarta: Rosemata Sampurna; Kinicki, A., Kreitner, R., (2010) Organizational Behavior, Key Concepts, Skills, and Best Practices, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Martorejo, N., (2016) SPIRIT Character in Christianism Perspective, , Jakarta: Personal Paper; McShane, S.L., Glinow, M.V., (2010) Organizational Behavior, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Mullins, J.L., (2005) Management and Organizational Behavior, , New Jersey: Prentice Hall; Ponijan, L., (2016) SPIRIT Character in Buddhist Perspective, , Jakarta: Personal Paper; Robbins, P., Judge, T.A., (2011) Organizational Behavior, , New Jersey: Pearson Prentice Hall; Schermerthorn, R.J., Jr., Uhl-Bien, M., Osborn, R.N., (2011) Organizational Behavior, , New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Slavin, R., (1991) Educational Psychology, Theory in to Practice, , Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall; Suhardi, U., (2016) SPIRIT Character in Buddhist Perspective, , Jakarta: Personal Paper",,,"BK21 Plus Project, University of Ulsan;University of Ulsan","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","10th International Conference on Human System Interactions, HSI 2017","17 July 2017 through 19 July 2017",,129837,,9781509046881,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

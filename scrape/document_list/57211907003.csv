One of the big communication company in Indonesia is PT T. One of problem in PT T is expected to address issues of service needs plain old telephone service (POTS) on the division of government service. For these reasons, the necessary system pots accurate prediction of service as a reference in determining the right policy. The data used are time series data for 5 years of service users. Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is conducted to build the model and Genetic Algorithm is built for improve the weight of parameter model. It shows that combination ANFIS and GA can improve the accuracy of prediction. © IJSTR 2019.","ANFIS; Particle Swarm Optimization; Plain Old Telephone Service; Prediction",,,,,,"Here are the results of the overall MPS segment data in the 2012 period listed on table 5 Based on the figure 3 and figure 4 we can compile the method that has been implemented. Then it will be seen. Better MAPE comparisons.

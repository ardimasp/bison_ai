The number of restaurants does not mean someone will visit each restaurant, so it is going to depend on various consideration. Here, an intelligent decision support model was developed to help people to get a restaurant suggestion that suitable for them. Seven parameters were adopted scientifically, i.e. customer interest, price/budget, distance between customer and restaurant, taste rating, cleanliness rating, facilities rating, and halal or nonhalal status. Through using the methods fuzzy logic, cosine similarity distance, selection, and optimization (i.e. hybrid Latin hyper-cube-hill-climbing), model is able to provide restaurant recommendation for individual user or group. In this study, the experiment involved 75 restaurants in Jakarta and eight customers. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

These two methods are going to be tested operating the same data-set in order to get the comparison result for both methods. The result shows that the hybrid model has a better performance than hill-climbing. Based on the number of global optimum value occurrence, the hybrid model outperformed 7.6% better than hill-climbing, and produced more stable average global optimum value. However, the model has a little longer running time due to a genuine characteristic of the model itself. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.","Hill-Climbing; Latin-Hyper-Cube; Optimization",,,,,,"Norvig, P.R., Intelligence, S.A., (2002) A modern approach, , Prentice Hall; Metropolis, N., Rosenbluth, A.W., Rosenbluth, M.N., Teller, A.H., Teller, E., Equation of state calculations by fast computing machines (1953) J.

The hospital located in DKI Jakarta (Indonesia) that has implemented the KM system as a pilot project is the population of this research. Where the respondents are medical personnel at the hospital. This study analyzes the correlation between the use of KM systems and the performance of hospital services, using independent-samples T-tests and ANOVA tests from SPSS and R Commander programs to prove the hypothesis of the two variables, namely the use of KM systems (capabilities) and hospital services performance. The results of this research have succeeded in proving that there are significant differences between medical personnel who rarely use the KM system and who often use it, with those who often have a greater level of service performance. Thus, it can be concluded that the KM system used by hospital has a positive effect seen in the performance of medical personnel. © 2019 IEEE.","hospital; KM System; services performance","Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Personnel; Hospital service; Independent samples t tests; Km systems; Knowledge management system; Level of Service; Medical personnel; Pilot projects; services performance; Hospitals",,,,"Binus University","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research supported by the Grant from PDUPT and Bina Nusantara University (BINUS).","Gusman, I., (2013) Pointers Ketua DPD RI Dalam Seminar Asosiasi Rumah Sakit Daerah, , http://www.irmangusman.com/sambutanketua-dpd-ri-dalam-seminar-asosiasi-rumah-sakit-daerah/, September 3 Retrieved Februari 14 2019; Wibisono, S., (2013) Kasus Malpraktek di Indonesia, , http://www.tempo.co/read/news/2013/03/25/058469172/Terjadi-182-Kasus-Malpraktek-di-Balikpapan, Maret 25 Retrieved Januari 23 2019; Gold, A.H., Malhotra, A., Segars, A.H., Knowledge management: An organizational capabilities perspective (2001) Journal of Management Information Systems, 18 (1), pp. 185-214. , Summer; Faust, B., Schweiz, N., (2015) Implementation of Tacit Knowledge Preservation and Transfer Methods, , http://www.fraserhealth.ca/media/Implementation-of-Tacit-Knowledge-Presevation-and-Transfer-Methods.pdf, Retrieved Mei 12; Bennet, A., Bennet, D., (2004) Organizational Survival in the New World: The Intelligent Complex Adaptive System, , Boston: Elsevier; (2010) Knowledge Management and Information.

Problems that often occur at hospitals in Indonesia was shown from the high malpractice rate in Indonesia, this problem made public confidence to the hospital was decline, this is indicated by the increasing number of Indonesian citizens who choose to seek the treatment at the hospital in neighboring countries. The suspected problems related to the knowledge management capability of the hospital. This study aims to reveal the role of knowledge management capabilities on the performance of hospital services and provide a prototype system that can improve the knowledge management capabilities of the hospital. The sample for this study are hospitals located in Jakarta. Where the respondent is the head of the hospital. The research method that will be used in this research is qualitative and quantitative method. This research generated a framework strategy to improve knowledge management capability at hospital by looking at factors influencing knowledge management capability of hospital in Indonesia, especially Jakarta. © 2018 IEEE.","hospital; knowledge management capability; services performance","Hospitals; Hospital service; Indonesians; Knowledge management capabilities; Primary care; Prototype system; Quantitative method; research methods; services performance; Knowledge management",,,,,,"Gusman, I., Pointers Ketua DPD Ri Dalam Seminar Asosiasi Rumah Sakit Daerah, , http://www.irmangusman.com/sambutan-ketua-dpd-ri-dalamseminar-Asosiasi-rumah-sakit-daerah/, IrmanGusman.com, 3 September 2013[Accessed 28 February 2018]; Meryana, E., Industri Rumah Sakit Harus Berbenah, , http://health.kompas.com/read/2012/07/20/14131214/Industri.Rumah.Sakit.Harus.Berbenah%20Diakses%2020%20Februari%202013, health.kompas.com, 20 July 2012.

It enables job seekers to look for an employment, to advance their careers, or to market themselves. As for the employers, they can post vacant positions to be filled with suitable employees. A certain job portal received numerous complaints regarding its features that were unable to fulfill the users' needs. These complaints led to the decrease of the number of users. A study was conducted to determine factors that influenced users' interest by referring to the 7C framework. Questionnaires were distributed to numerous job seekers and employers. The data were analyzed using multiple linear regression technique. Chi-square analysis was also performed to further analyze which elements of the 7C framework were essential for the users. The results showed that only four out of seven elements from the framework affected the users' choice towards job portal, namely the context, the content, the community, and the commerce.

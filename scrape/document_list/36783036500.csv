However, the effective implementation of AHP for decision making in industries still becomes a question. This research aims at developing a systematic literature review using the real cases implementing AHP, both in manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries, from 2000 to 2020. To obtain research results, we select seventy-eight cases and utilize AHP combined with other methods. The results of this study show that twenty-two scientific works of literature combine AHP with other methods. GIS method and Expert choice software are the most frequently implemented methods combined with AHP. The finding of this study is expected to be a reference and recommendation for researchers or practitioners in using AHP in various industries. © 2020 EManuscript Technologies.

Quantity Discount Pricing Integrated Newsvendor Model (this term will further be called as Extended Newsvendor) was examined then having its performance compared with subjective method which has already been used by the companies. The comparison was done to discover which method is able to reduce the potential shortage of supplies, total cost of each unit, age of inventory, and order frequency. Extended Newsvendor method was chosen to be examined in the first place due to its assumption which was deemed suitable with the actual condition that is encountered by the companies, where the demand happens stochastically, and quantity discount pricing policy is applied. The calculation that utilizes 5 years of the company historical data, this research find that the Extended Newsvendor method is generally able to improve the performance of the order quantity medium-sized companies but is unable to improve the performance of the order quantity of small-sized companies. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Age of inventory; Newsvendor; Order frequency; Quantity discount",,,,,,"The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest during the process of the research and writing of this manuscript.

The development of knowledge makes it easier for farmers to improve farming skills, so potatoes are not only found in the Dieng Wonosobo area, but are starting to be planted in various regions in Indonesia, one of which is Tawangmangu. Dieng and Tawangmangu areas are the same in the province of Central Java. Often the obstacles experienced by farmers to date are the marketing of potatoes at a selling price that benefits farmers. This research was conducted to compare marketing sales of potatoes in the Dieng and Tawangmangu mountains. The scope of the research object is in accordance with the problems to be studied, namely the marketing of potato products, with a research unit of potato farmers in the Dieng mountains and Tawangmangu, Central Java. This research is a qualitative descriptive study. The results of the research are the marketing design of the Dieng and Tawangmangu mountain ranges. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Dieng Wonosobo; Farmers; Marketing; Potatoes; Tawangmangu","Electronic commerce; Landforms; Marketing; Sales; Descriptive studies; Dieng Wonosobo; Farmers; Marketing designs; Mountain ranges; Potatoes; Research object; Tawangmangu; Agriculture",,,,"Binus University","This paper can be tangible because many authors are assisted by Bina Nusantara University, especially to Prof. Tirta Nugraha Mursitama, Vice Chancellor of Research and Technology Transfer at Bina Nusantara University, which has facilitated our research.","(2014) World Bank and Environment in Indonesia, , https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/indonesia/brief/world-bank-and-environment-in-indonesia, worldbank, Online.

There are two common supply chains, namely supply chains without company intervention and supply chains with a mix of corporate hands. This study chooses supply chain design ranging from purchasing seed farmers, buying, to selling. Supply chains are interconnected and have different interests. The application of supply chains without company intervention is still considered ineffective and inefficient for farmers. Future research can improve this research with more detailed cost details.

The respondents were 1,501 women of Eligible Couple (Elco) aged 15-49 years living in poor, slum, and densely populated areas in Jakarta. The findings show that 62.9% of Elco use modern contraceptives and 39.5% of them use LTCM. All independent variables of FP have a significant linear relationship with FP Behavior with a coefficient of below 0.500 (weak). The influence of behavior on LTCM practice has a coefficient correlation below 0.500, with an exception for LTCM Attitude on LTCM Behavior at 53.3 %. The coefficient correlation of attitude and behavior on the practice of SHPFN is also still low. We recommend greater awareness via information dissemination, education, and communication (IEC) provided to the people and Eligible Couples that modern contraceptive methods including LTCM are safe and comfortable to use. There should also be collaboration between FP providers with health centres, clinics, hospital, and private services providers. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Family planning behaviour; IEC; Long Term Contraceptive Method; Practice of SHPFN",,,,,,,"Allan, K., Burridge, K., (1991) Euphemism & Dysphemism: Language Used as Shield and Weapon, pp. 92-97. , New York: Oxford University Press; Bandura, A., (1986) Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory, , Englewood Cliff, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Barden-O’Fallon, Speizer, I., What differentiates method stoppers from switchers?

Restaurants and fast food industry also use potatoes as the ingredients. Wonosobo regency is one of the areas in Java producing a lot of potatoes and the majority of the population work as farmers. The purpose of this research is to find out the network design of potato supply chain in Wonosobo regency in order to design a more effective and efficient one. This research uses the descriptive qualitative method and the processes of collecting data are observation, interview, and documentation. The results suggest that the current supply chain design of potatoes is from farmers, middlemen, retailers, and consumers. An alternative network design proposed is the farmers should channel the lower quality potatoes directly to the retailers. While another alternative is, for the good quality potatoes, the farmers should sell them to cooperative for export. © 2018 Authors.","Design; Export; Indonesia; Potato; Supply chain; Wonosobo regency",,,,,,,"Chopra, S., Sodhi, M.S., Managing risk to avoid supply chain breakdown (2004) MIT Sloan Management Review; Chopra, S., Meindl, P., (2001) Supply Chain Management: Strategy, Planning, and Operations, , New Jersey: Prentice Hall; Deep, A., Dani, S., Managing Global Food Supply Chain Risks: A Scenario Planning Perspective (2009) POMS 20th Annual Conference, , Orlando, Florida, POMS Abstract Number: 011-0371; Diaz, L.C., Hansel, J.E., Making Risk sharing models work with farmers, agribusinesses and financial institutions (2007) International Conference on Rural Finance Research: Moving Results into Policies and Practice, pp. 1-55. , FAO.

This study aims to determine the work centre that is experiencing a shortage of production capacity and production capacity planning is proposed as an alternative work centre to optimise production capacity at minimal cost using Rough Cut Capacity Planning (RCCP). This type of research is descriptive. Data was collected through interviews and observations and used to perform capacity planning, i.e.The company's policy of data, company resource data, cost data, and historical demand data. Data processing begins with forecasting consumer demand while RCCP is used to determine the work centre that is experiencing a shortage of production capacity. The proposed production capacity is used as an alternative work centre in increasing production capacity. The results from this study, including the estimated plastic demand for the coming 12 months are 434 766 Kg; There are four work centres that are experiencing a shortage of production capacity at the company, which is cutting manual work centre, work centre cutting machines, sealing work centre and work centre printing; fulfilment capacity planning alternative is a recommendation that is considered to be the most optimal.

At the end of 2011, the hotel would like to add the facilities as many as 66 rooms with modern interior design. The problem faced during the execution of the plan based on the interview summary with the hotel manager is that each division complains about many things. Teammate sabotaging each other, unsupportive working environment due to lack of employee due to the additional 66 rooms created worries among housekeeping that they need to work extra or they need to ask for a raise. Hotel supervision is not very encouraging, not calming the atmosphere and from the complaints the employees do not earn job satisfaction. Most of the employees worried that their job descriptions are going to add up then the supervision needs to think about new employee recruitment, opening job search for public.

Impulses talk about humans’ spontaneous action when facing dynamic happenings in life. This paper reviews the strategic impulses the TMTs do and decide to keep the firm performance updated and well performing. Dynamic changes occur continuously and it is essential to be able to adapt every time through continuous innovation, whether in hard – planning innovation and soft planning innovation. Though the strategic impulses are important, but it is long debated, as we can see that Impulse-driven logics are notoriously tricky to identify, isolate and describe [2] and also rational decision-making may often result in an optimal response of inaction, while impulse-driven action represents the opposite extreme, an individual logic of ‘act before you think.’ Therefore, impulse-driven entrepreneurship thusly considered suggests a breakdown in governing logic, a failure to think things through, or even foolishness [2]. The unpredictable results of Strategic impulses have left the top management in doubts whether the Strategic impulses are actually an opportunity or a threat. © BEIESP.","Firm excellence; Innovation; Opportunity; Strategic impulses",,,,,,"Simpeh, K.N., (2011) Entrepreneurship Theories and Empirical Research: A Summary Review of the Literature, 3 (6), pp. 1-9; Hunt, R.A., Lerner, D.A., (2017) Follow MUSE NON-DELIBERATIVE, UNREASONED NASCENT-STAGE Ventur; Sofka, W., (2007) ZEW Centre for European Economic Research ZEW Centre for European Economic Research.

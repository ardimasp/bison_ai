However, the spread of news in online media is not all true (hoax). The problems faced by internet users of hoax news can be solved through pattern recognition. Research data was conducted of 2,000 Indonesian news, 1,000 for non-hoax news, and 1,000 for hoax news. Data was collected from Indonesian online news portals by crawling text methods. The research model was built using CRISP-DM methodology. The results showed that as high as 96,01% accuracy can be achieved using Support Vector Machine. Based on these results, it can be concluded that this modeling can be used to support the detection of hoax news in Indonesia today. It is hoped that this model can also be applied to help the government filter news that will be distributed to the people of Indonesia. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Therefore, many researchers compete with others to present their best in object recognition. Since object recognition has been studied for a long time and encompassed diverse approaches, therefore a review of the latest works is needed. This paper aims to deliver the trends in object recognition researches focusing on instance recognition and foreground detection such as salient object detection and object detection as supporting methods. Covering 34 publications, we survey the approaches, methods, datasets, performance measure, and experimental results. We also present research challenges in object recognition which can be used as suggestions for future works. We hope that our work can provide an overview of the current trends for object recognition and foreground detection methods. © 2019 The Authors.

The consideration can use the data which is generated by system online analytical processing (OLTP). However the OLTP system has a limitation to report intuitively. The aim of this research is to create the system using data warehouse which able to see the progress of performance student and the course failed in each term. This system is expected able to predict student's graduation eligibility. Research method of this research consists some steps to implement data warehouse and then is followed by generating the report and on-line analytical processing (OLAP) analysis. Evaluation is done by benchmarking current system with the proposed system. The result shows the system can provide data for the graduation eligibility. © 2018 IEEE.","data warehouses; graduation eligibility; OLAP; university","Data warehouses; Information management; graduation eligibility; OLAP; On-line analytical processing; research methods; System online; university; Students",,,,,,"Inmon, W.H., (1992) Building the Data Warehouse, , John Wiley; Codd, E.F., Codd, S.B., Salley, C.T., Providing OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) to User Analyst: An IT Mandate, , http://www.arborsoft.com/OLAP.html, Accessed from Arbor Softwares website; Kimball, R., (1996) The Data Warehouse Toolkit, , John Wiley; Barclay, T., Barnes, R., Gray, J., Sundaresan, P., Loading databases using dataflow parallelism (1994) SIGMOD Record, 23 (4); Blakeley, J.A., Coburn, N., Larson, P., Updating derived relations: Detecting irrelevant and autonomously computable updates (1989) ACM TODS, 4 (3); Gupta, A., Munick, I.S., Maintenance of materialized views: Problems, techniques, and applications (1995) Data Engineering Bulletin, 18 (2); Zhuge, Y., Garcia-Mollina, H., Hammer, J., Widom, J., View maintenance in a warehousing environment (1995) Proc. of SIGMOD Conference; Roussopoulos, N., The Maryland adms project: Views r us (1995) Data Engineering Bulletin, 18 (2); Sandhu, M.K., Kaur, A., Kaur, R., Data warehouses schema (2016) International Journal of Innovative Research in Advanced Engineering (IJIRAE, 2 (4), pp. 47-51; Rausch, N., (2012) Stars and Models: How to Build and Maintain Star Schemas Using SAS® Data Integration Server in SAS®9, , SAS Institute, Paper 096-31",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2018","3 September 2018 through 5 September 2018",,142373,,9781538658215,,,"English","Proc.

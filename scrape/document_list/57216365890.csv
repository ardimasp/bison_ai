The most important asset in a company is its employees. However, it is increasingly difficult for HR professionals to acquire and maintain the required talents. To solve this issue, organizations are starting to use gamification. Gamification is a design process where elements or mechanics in gaming are added to a non-game application or system. Compared to the standard recruitment, gamified recruitment has several advantages such as: 1) identify motivated candidates, 2) evaluate people without much experience more easily, 3) evaluate people who have diverse experience, and 4) engage the candidate. By using Marczewski’s gamification framework, we provide a theory-based guide on how to implement gamification in employee recruitment using a simple gamification framework. Though this proposed idea has not yet been tested, we believe that this idea is feasible in real life application. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

There are many online marketplaces available in Indonesia, with Shopee being one of the fastest growing e-commerce players in Indonesia. This research aims to find out Shopee's customers demographic, and e-business value creation factors that influence consumers' intention to shop online using Shopee. Based on the data collected, the majority of Shopee's customers are in the 25-34 years old and 35-44 years age old group, and on average they spend less than 1 million Rupiah per month at Shopee. Out of all factors in the e-business value creation, the research shows that all factors (Complementarities, Lock-In, Novelty, and Efficiency) positively affect intention to use Shopee. © 2019 IEEE.","e-business; e-commerce; online shopping; shopee; value creation","Intelligent systems; E-business values; Indonesia; Intention to use; Lock-in; On-line marketplaces; Electronic commerce",,,,,"Konana, W., Yin, B., An Empirical Investigation of Net-Enabled Business Value (2004) MIS Q, 28 (4), p. 585; Merriam-Webster Internet | Definition of Internet by Merriam-Webster, , https://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/Internet, [Accessed: 14-Oct-2019]; Kaur, G., Traditional commerce vs ecommerce (2011) Int.

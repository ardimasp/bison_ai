Driving style not only relates to a risk that people may involve but it also may relate to preserving the eco-driving behavior. This study proposed a quantification of the behavior along with risky drivers' behavior. The study involved a number of residents in some cities in Indonesia and conducted using a translated Manchester Driving Behavior questionnaire (MDBQ). About 89 collected filled questionnaire (68.5% male, 31.5% female) analyzed in this study. Based on reliability and validity test, questions Q2, Q3, Q8, Q10, and Q15 removed from further analysis, with final Cronbach's alpha value = 0.946. There were 12 questions that similar with an eco-driving behavior on the adapted MDBQ (as variable 1), and the remaining 33 questions treated as variable 2 which represented a risky driving behavior. This study showed that the participants has low to medium level of risky behavior and medium eco driving behavior. The statistical test revealed a significant correlation between those variables (r = 0.727; p<0.01). It confirm that less eco-driving behavior (indicated by higher answer's score) has a close relation with risky driving behavior. Increasing awareness of safe driving during eco-driving behavior training is suggested, and hopefully, it will increase the training success rate in long-term in the formed the expected behavior. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In-cylinder pressure and temperature can be calculated for gasoline four-cycle engine. Modeling is done by treating each step in the cylinder as a volume control, solving the conservation equations of energy with submodules for combustion, heat transfer and dynamic analysis. Calculations in cycles are performed at each crank angle, so that the correct angle of ignition, variations in velocity, amount of intake mass and fuel burning speed can be predicted. Adjustment for the combustion parameter such as burn duration and form factor of the Wiebe function to increase the model accuracy was performed. It is shown that the optimization of the Wiebe function parameters able to improve the sum squared error of the engine pressure estimation by 58.17% compared to the result from generalized parameter functions, and the parameter of form factor and burn duration are influential by around twice of (1.86 and 2.55 times, respectively) the efficiency factor. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,,,,,,,"Heywood, J.B., (1988) Internal Combustion Engine Fundamentals, , (McGraw-Hill Education, Singapore); Ferguson, C.R., Kirkpatrick, A., (2016) Internal Combustion Engine: Applied Thermosciences, , (Willey, Chichester); Cooney, Y.C., Worm, J., Michalek, D., Naber, J., (2008) J.

In addition, with the continuous entrance of foreign companies penetrating the Indonesia gas market, increases the stringent of the competition. In order to be able to stay competitive, PT. PERTAMINA, an Indonesian state-owned oil and natural gas corporation, is required to be able to support such continuously increasing needs. The Shipping Division in the firm is expected to be able to deliver crude oil from the load port crude to refinery unit by using available owned and chartered vessels. In the current crude oil distribution system, every day the company assigned total of 49 vessels where three of them are owned and the remaining are chartered. Due to the archipelagic nature of Indonesia in addition to the variety of the sea and strait depths, some refinery areas are remote and reachable on by selected types of vessels. Integer programming model combined with CDS algorithm for m-machine are used to provide better crude distribution system for the company. As a result, the company can save up to 51% on the number of vessels needed to be used to transport the crude oil. © 2015 IEEE.","archipelago; CDS algorithm; crude oil; integer programming; load port crude; refinery unit","Integer programming; Refining; archipelago; CdS; Distribution systems; Foreign companies; Integer programming models; Oil and natural gas corporations; Oil distributions; refinery unit; Crude oil",,,,,,"Dudley, B., (2014) BP Statistical Review of World Energy, p. 9. , June 2014, in press; Goetschalckx, M., (2011) Supply Chain Engineering, , New York: Springer; Caric, T., Gold, H., Vehicle routing problem (2008) Vehicle Routing Problem, p. 5; Moh Abd, M., El, A., El-Ghareeb, M.S.M.A.H., Review in finding path problem classification and algorithms in vehicle routing (2014) International Journal of Information Science and Intelligent System, p. 5; Chiarandini, M., (2013) Vehicle Routing.

A distribution problem experienced by the Logistics &amp; Distribution division in one of the leading 3PL providers in Jakarta is studied in this paper. Starting 2008, this division partitioned Jakarta province into three clustered areas in which a main dedicated courier is allocated for each cluster. The segregation is done based on the house location of these three main couriers. Total of 13 couriers are ready to be dispatched at any time in addition to the three main couriers. This paper consider a variant of the clustered vehicle routing problem (CluVRP) used to determine a new model and solution methodology for clustering, routing and scheduling couriers in a 3PL company. The objective is to determine a set of vehicle routes which minimize the total cost and deliver all packages without violating any vehicle capacity. The application involved two phases. In the first phase, customers are grouped to several delivery areas according to average demand and frequency of demand occurrences. The clustering algorithm used in this phase is the first phase of sweep A variant with goal to balance the load distribution among the main couriers. In the second phase, CVRP for each main courier in each area is solved by comparing Clarke-Wright saving and nearest neighbor methods. The result shows that implementing the new clustering system combined with nearest neighbor method allows the provider to reduce the number of maximum couriers needed to be dispatched daily by 60% on average. It also allows 43% reduction in the total distance travelled by these couriers which leads to minor CO2 emissions. © 2015 IEEE.","Clarke-Wright Savings; cluster; CluVRP; CVRP; nearest neighbor; sweep method","Carbon dioxide; Outsourcing; Transportation; Vehicles; Clarke-Wright Savings; cluster; CluVRP; CVRP; Nearest neighbors; Sweep method; Clustering algorithms",,,,,,"Bowersox, D., Closs, D., Cooper, M.B., (2012) Supply Chain Logistics Management, , McGraw-Hill; Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Musmanno, R., (2013) Introduction to Logistics Systems Management, , New York: John Wiley & Sons; Zhou, X., Xie, X., A study on the organization structure of thirdparty logistics enterprise servicing for manufacturing enterprise (2010) International Journal of Business and Management, pp. 200-204; Coyle, J.J., Langley, C.J., Jr., Novack, R.A., Gibson, B.J., (2013) Managing Supply Chains.

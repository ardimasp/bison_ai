There are a lot of factors affecting delays in a construction project. Each construction project has its own characteristic which is different from other projects regarding the nature of the project and its location. Kepulauan Anambass Regency is several islands located on the remote and outmost of Indonesia which makes construction projects in this area unique according to its location. The aim of this research is to identify the dominant factors that cause delay in building construction project located in Kepulauan Anambass Regency. The results show that the dominant factors are delay in material delivery, transportation problems in material delivery, shortage of material in the market and adverse weather condition. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","building construction project; delay; dominant factors; Kepulauan Anambas","Materials handling; Adverse weather; Building construction projects; Construction projects; delay; Dominant factor; Kepulauan Anambas; Material deliveries; Transportation problem; Construction",,,,"Binus University","The authors would like to acknowledge Bina Nusantara University for the funding support of the research project.","Mhetre, K., Konnur, B., Landage, A.B., Risk Management in Construction Industry (2016) International Journal of Engineering Research, 5, pp. 153-155; Odimabo, O.O., Oduoza, C.F., Suresh, S., Methodology for Project Risk Assessment of Building Construction Projects Using Bayesian Belief Networks (2017) International Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 6, pp. 221-234; Wongkar, Y.K., Tjakra, J., Pratasis, P.A., Analisis Life Cycle Cost Pada Pembangunan Gedung (Studi Kasus: Sekolah St: URSULA Kotamobagu) (2016) Jurnal Sipil Statik, 4, pp. 253-262; Hassan, H., Mangare, J.B., Pratasis, P.A., Faktor-Faktor Penyebab Keterlambatan Pada Proyek Konstruksi Dan Alternatif Penyelesaiannya (Studi Kasus: Di Manado Town Square III) (2016) Jurnal Sipil Statik, 4, pp. 657-664; Shebob, A., Dawood, N., Shah, R.K., Development of A Methodology for Analysing and Quantifying the Impact of Delay Factors Affecting Construction Projects (2012) Journal of Construction Engineering and Project Management, 2 (3), pp. 17-29; Sweis, G.J., Factors Affecting Time Overruns in Public Construction Projects: The Case of Jordan (2013) International Journal of Business and Management, 8 (23), pp. 120-129; Akhund, M.A., Khoso, A.R., Memon, U., Khahro, S.H., Time Overrun in Construction Projects of Developing Countries (2017) Imperial Journal of Interdisciplinary Research (IJIR), 3, pp. 124-129; Akomah, B.B., Jackson, E.N., Contractors' Perception of Factors Contributing to Road Project Delay (2016) International Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 5, pp. 79-85; Ameh, O.J., Osegbo, E.E., Study of Relationship between Time Overrun and Productivity on Construction Sites (2011) International Journal of Construction Supply Chain Management, 1 (1), pp. 56-67; Subramani, T., Lishitha, P., Kavitha, M., Time Overrun and Cost Effectiveness in the Construction Industry (2014) International Journal of Engineering Research and Applications, 4, pp. 111-116; Pirabahar, S., Vijay, P., Vairamuni, T., A Study on Cost and Time Overrun and Its Preventive Measures in Building Construction Projects (2017) SSRG International Journal of Civil Engineering, pp. 452-455; Raykar, P., Ghadge, A., Analyzing the Critical Factors Influencing the Time Overrun and Cost Overrun in Construction Project (2016) International Journal of Engineering Research, 5, pp. 21-25; Gunduz, M., Nielse, Y., Özdemir, M., Quantification of Delay Factors Using the Relative Importance Index Method for Construction Projects in Turkey (2013) Journal of Management in Engineering, 29 (2), pp. 133-139; Soputan, G.E.M., Sompie, B.F., Mandagi, R.J.M., Manajemen Risiko Kesehatan Dan Keselamatan Kerja (K3) (Study Kasus Pada Pembangunan Gedung SMA Eben Haezar) (2014) Jurnal Ilmiah Media Engineering, 4, pp. 229-238; Gunduz, M., Yahya, A.M.A., (2015) Analysis of Project Success Factors in Construction Industry; (2004) Risk Management, , A.

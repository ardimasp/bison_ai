Many benefits can be gained from the use of DMS such as document management become better and more efficient. However, DMS will not improve the performance of document management if it is not used appropriately. This study aims to determine the effect of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of the acceptance of the use of DMS. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) used in this study to determine the acceptance of DMS usage. Samples were taken from 50 employees who have access to the DMS. Data samples are analyzed with Partial Least Square (PLS) method using SmartPLS 3.0. The results showed that acceptance of DMS depends on perceived ease of use that influence usefulness of DMS and led to the acceptance of DMS. © 2018 IEEE.","Document Management System; Partial Least Square; SmartPLS; Technology Acceptance Model","Least squares approximations; Data sample; Document management; Document management systems; Partial least square (PLS); Perceived ease of use; Perceived usefulness; SmartPLS; Technology acceptance model; Information services",,,,,"Lai, V.S., Li, H., Technology acceptance model for internet banking: An invariance analysis (2005) Information & Management, 42 (2), pp. 373-386; Davis, F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3), pp. 319-340; Letchumanan, M., Muniandy, B., Migrating to e-book: A study on perceived usefulness and ease of use (2013) Library Hi Tech News, 30 (7), pp. 10-16; Mohd Hashim, S.F.S., Ismail, Z., Relationship on perceived ease of use of electronic document towards job performance (2013) IEEE Business Engineering and Industrial Applications Colloquium (BEIAC), , Langkawi, Malaysia; Ikhlas, M., Iriawan, N., Tjahyanto, A., Analisis technology acceptance model (tam) terhadap document management system (dms) pada badan pengawasan keuangan dan pembangunan (2011) Prosiding Seminar Nasional Manajemen Teknologi XI, , Surabaya; Venkatesh, V., Thong, J.Y.L., Xu, X., Consumer acceptance and use of information technology: Extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (2012) MIS Quarterly-JSTOR, 36 (1), pp. 157-178; Hair, J.F., Hult, G.T.M., Ringle, C., Sarstedt, M., (2016) A Primer on Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), , London: SAGE Publications; Wong, K.K.K., Partial least squares structural equation modeling (pls-sem) techniques using smartpls (2013) Marketing Bulletin, 24 (1), pp. 1-32; Fornell, C., Larcker, D.F., Evaluating structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error (1981) Journal of Marketing Research, 18 (1), pp. 39-50; Lowry, P.B., James, G., Partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM) for building and testing behavioral causal theory: When to choose it and how to use it (2014) IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, 57 (2), pp. 123-146",,,"et al.;Sampoerna University;STMIK Bina Insani;STMIK Nusa Mandiri;Universitas BSI;Universitas Budi Luhur","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd International Conference on Informatics and Computing, ICIC 2018","17 October 2018 through 18 October 2018",,150225,,9781538669204,,,"English","Proc.

This ability is expected to bring up a condition in which a person has full active awareness of the awakening of the entrepreneurial spirit within himself to then produce a productive person called Entrepreneurial Mindfulness. This study aims to develop self-detection tools about Entrepreneurial Mindfulness through an artificial intelligence-based website for students and alumni who are entrepreneurs.The research method used is the Neuroresearch method for developing Entrepreneurial Mindfulness measurement tools and the waterfall method for developing Artificial Intelligence-based websites. The results of research in the form of an Artificial Intelligence-based website about Entrepreneurial Mindfulness where the website will be able to provide profiling based on diagnoses made related to the level of Entrepreneurial Mindfulness owned by students and alumni in implementing entrepreneurial practices. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Websites; Measurement tools; research methods; Self detection; Self-diagnose; Waterfall methods; Artificial intelligence",,,,,"Warwick, K, (2013) Artificial intelligence: the basics, , (Routledge); Russell, SJ, Norvig, P, (2010) Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 3. , (Prentice Hall); Liao, S-H, Expert system methodologies and applications-a decade review from 1995 to 2004 (2005) Expert Syst Appl, 28, pp. 93-103; Purda, L, Skillicorn, D, Accounting variables, deception, and a bag of words: Assessing the tools of fraud detection (2015) Contemp Account Res, 32, pp. 1193-1223; Audretsch, DB, Kuratko, DF, Link, AN, Making sense of the elusive paradigm of entrepreneurship (2015) Small Bus Econ, 45, pp. 703-712; Edward, L, Kerr, SP, Kerr, WR, Link, C, Glaeser, EL, Kerr, SP, (2015) Entrepreneurship and Urban Growth: An Empirical Assessment with Historical Mines The Harvard community has made this article openly available.

Based on data from 'The Role of SMEs in Asia and Their Difficulties in Accessing Finance', one of the four countries in Asia with the largest percentage of SMEs is Indonesia (99.9%). The authors will conduct this particular investigation on SMEs as they play a vital role and have a huge impact on the economic development of Indonesia. According to survey results from Price Waterhouse Coopers in 2014 regarding family businesses, 95% of businesses in Indonesia are owned or managed by families. Previous findings from family enterprise research show how family engagement as a function of family business positively affects the relationship between innovation and enterprise success. More than 1.022.213 publications released between 2014 and 2019 were screened using the keywords: digital business adoption, e-business adoption, e-commerce adoption, family commitment, family firms, SME innovation, and SME performance. Eventually, for this study, 21 journals were selected based on this analysis, the conceptual model has four possible connections: the good relationship between digital business adoption and SME achievements; the positive relationship between the adoption of digital business and innovativeness; the positive direct impacts of innovativeness on family-firm performance; and a good relationship between SME performance and family commitment and innovativeness. This research refers to a conceptual framework that could play a major part in the success of SMEs through digital business, family commitment, and innovativeness. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises represent around 97 to 99% of the enterprise population in most ASEAN countries. In Indonesia, small and medium-sized enterprises made up 99.99% of total businesses and employ 97% of the workforce. Based on data from small and medium-sized enterprises that are already using the internet in Indonesia, the use of e-commerce is still between 9 and 15%. One of the innovation types was frugal innovation, which can be defined as products, services, or solutions that arise regardless of financial, human, technological or other resource constraints, and where the end result is cheaper than competitive offers and meets the needs of customers who have not yet been served otherwise. The objective of this research is to investigate the impact of digital business adoption, frugal innovation, and organizational innovation on firm performance. The study was conducted using a descriptive quantitative method in Indonesia. A structured research questionnaire was developed using a Likert scale-four. Data from a total of 100 returned questionnaires was analysed with SEM-PLS. The results of this research show how the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is affected by digital business adoption, frugal innovation and organisational innovation. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

They reveal that Indonesia's ""Digital Islands"" are the largest internet user-base in the Southeast Asian region (150 million internet users in 2018), generate the largest internet economy ($27 billion in the year 2018) and operate the fastest-growing internet economy in Southeast Asia. However, the use of E-commerce itself in the sector of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia is still only between 9-15 %. The objective of this review is to establish a theoretical model that links digital business adoption, organizational innovation, frugal innovation type, and firm performance. A systematic literature review (SLR) is the method used for the critical review. The critical result of the review is used as the basis for the development of the concept. More than 864,000 publications released between 2014 and 2019 were screened using the keywords: digital business adoption, e-business adoption, e-commerce adoption, type of innovation, frugal innovation, organisational innovation, and firm performance. Eventually, for this study, 23 journals were included. Based on the analysis, the conceptual model has four possible connections: (1) The positive relationship between digital business adoption and SME achievements; (2) the good relationship between the adoption of digital businesses and organisational innovation; (3) the positive direct impacts of organizational innovations on company performance; and (4) a positive relationship exists between digital business adoption and frugal innovation type and organizational innovation. This study contributes a conceptual framework that digital business adoption, frugal innovation type, and organisational innovation might have important roles in the performance of SMEs. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Digitl business; Organisational performance; SMEs",,,,,,"Abebe, M., Electronic Commerce Adoption, Entrepreneurial Orientation And Small-And Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME) performance (2014) Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, 21 (1), pp. 100-116. , https://doi.org/10.1108/JSBED-10-2013-0145; (2019) Pasar IdEA 2019 Hadir Untuk Pertama Kalinya Di Indonesia, , https://www.idea.or.id/berita/detail/pasar-idea-2019-hadir-untuk-pertama-kalinya-di-indonesia; Ballot, G., Fakhfakh, F., Galia, F., Salter, A., The fateful triangle: Complementarities in performance between product, process and organizational innovation in France and the UK ?

It is essential for a company to make its employees satisfied and pleased with their jobs. These very satisfaction and pleasure are hoped to serve as a key for motivating employees to perform and contribute their best for the company. Numerous research studies have proven the positive effect of work well-being on job performance, but the findings came with inconsistencies and controversies. This fact has caused reluctance in a good many companies to invest in their employees’ work well-being. A survey of 509 millennial employees in the Indonesian startup digital industry was conducted in this research. The results show that employee’s work well-being had a significant, positive effect on job performance. Theoretically, this research has contributed in responding to inconsistencies in literature. It is hoped that this research will also offer practical contribution to individual employees as well as human resources department and increase company executives’ confidence in making organization-related strategic decisions to attain sustainable performance. Finally, we propose a number of intervention suggestions for performance improvement through work well-being. © 2020 by the authors;","Industrial Revolution; Job Performance; Millennial; Sustainable Performance; Work Well-being",,,,,,"Albuquerque, A.S., Troccoli, B.T., Development a measure of subjective well-being (2004) Psicologia, 20, pp. 153-164; Amelia, A., (2018) Employer Branding: When HR Is the New Marketing, , Jakarta, Indonesia: Penerbit Buku Kompas; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review of recommended two step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 411-423; (2012) Creating People Advantage: Mastering HR Challenges in A Two Speed World, , BCG; Bouckenooghe, D., Raja, U., Butt, A.N., Combined effect of positive and negative affectivity and job satisfaction on job performance and turnover intentions (2013) Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied, 147 (2), pp. 105-123; Campbell, J.P., Modeling the performance prediction problem in industrial and organizational psychology (1990) Handbook of Industrial and Organizational Psychology, pp. 687-732. , Dalam M.

Universities in Indonesia are required to be able to face and adjust to the changes that occurred in the industrial revolution era 4.0. Many universities think that moving lecture material into online or using high-specification computers means that they have taken part in implementing technology-based learning. The lecturer is the most important person who must respond to the changing times. Lecturers are the front guard in education at the university level. In addition to being important to produce quality graduates according to the needs of the times, self-quality renewal is also important for the sustainability of the lecturers' careers. Research conducted on the performance of industrial revolution-based 4.0 lecturers was used as the theme in this study because researchers assumed that lecturers had an important role in the industrial revolution era 4.0 for that the performance of lecturers needed improved in order to produce quality student graduates in accordance with the industrial revolution era 4.0. The performance of lecturers at this time is still a lot that has not been maximized in supporting the industrial revolution 4.0, this situation is possible because many factors influence it.

In the digital business industry, innovative work behaviour has been considered as a key performance indicator. Individual performance becomes the basis of the company performance which will further increase the value of the company. This study employs the paradigm of positive psychology, focusing on how performance improvement can be achieved by increasing employee work well-being. Previous studies show that there is an inconsistency in the relationship between work well-being and performance. So, it needs to be understood further through the role of mediation variables that can explain when an employee work wellbeing can improve performance. This study aims to examine the role of employee organisational commitment as a mediator of the relationship between employee work well-being and innovative work behaviour. Taking the digital business industry in Indonesia as a research context, this research reveals that employee organisational commitment fully mediated the relationship between employee work well-being and innovative work behaviour.

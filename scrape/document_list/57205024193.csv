Therefore, the company implements the policy processing system. To determine the level of employee acceptance of the system and to improve the use of policy processing system, an evaluation of the system with extended UTAUT method is required. Extended UTAUT method use UTAUT method as a basic model and add two variables which are variable vendor support and management effectiveness. The proposed model use effort expectancy, performance expectancy, facilitating condition, social influence, behavior intention, use behavior variable (UTAUT method), vendor support and management effectiveness as additional variable. This study aims are to determine the effect of effort expectancy, performance expectancy, management effectiveness, and social influence variable on behavior intention of policy processing system. Other purposes are to know whether use behavior is affected by vendor support, facilitating condition and behavior intention variable in policy processing system. Data collection was used survey method by using questionnaire. The subject / sample are employees who use policy processing system at general insurance company in underwriting, marketing and reinsurance department which total are 180 employees. Data analysis was using software SmartPLS2. The result of data analysis show that social influence is the most significant variable that affecting behavior intention (0.408) and management effectiveness does not affect behavior intention. Performance expectancy (0.258), effort expectancy (0.398) affects behavior intention. The result also shows that behavior intention (0.671), facilitating condition (0.222) and vendor support (0.142) affect the use behavior. © 2018 IEEE.","ERP; evaluation; UTAUT; vendor support","Data handling; Enterprise resource planning; Information analysis; Information management; Insurance; Personnel; Surveys; evaluation; Facilitating conditions; Improve performance; Insurance companies; Management effectiveness; Significant variables; UTAUT; Vendor support; Economic and social effects",,,,,"Abdulwahab, L., Zulkhairi, M.D., Effectiveness of telecentre using a model of unified theory of acceptance and use of Technology (UTAUT): Structural Equation Modeling Approach (2011) Journal of Emerging Trends in Computing and Information Sciences, 2 (9), pp. 402-412; Abdulwahab, L., Zulkhairi, M.D., Modeling the determinants and gender, age and ethnicity difference in telecommunication centre Acceptance (2012) Research Journal of Information Technology, 4 (3), pp. 85-102; Al-Hadban, W.K.H.M., Hashim, K.F., Yusof, S.A.M., Investigating the organizational and the environmental issues that influence the adoption of healthcare Information Systems in Public Hospitals of Iraq (2016) Computer and Information Science, 9 (2), pp. 126-139; Alfa, A.A.G., Rachmatin, D., Agustina, F., Analisis pengaruh faktor keputusan konsumen dengan structural equation modeling partial least square (2017) EurekaMatika, 5 (2), pp. 1-13; Almazán, D.A., Tovar, Y.S., Quintero, J.M.M., Influence of information systems on organizational results (2017) Contaduría y Administración, 62, pp. 321-338; Almgren, K., Bach, C., Erp systems and their effects on organizations: A proposed scheme for erp success ASEE 2014 Zone i Conference, , April 3-5, 2014.

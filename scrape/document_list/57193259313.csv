The results for Thailand indicate that there is unidirectional Granger causality running from export to CO2 emissions, GDP to CO2 emissions, and GDP to energy consumption. The evidences from Malaysia illustrate that there is also unidirectional Granger causality running from energy consumption to CO2 emissions, export to CO2 emissions. The finding of this research has powerful policy implication for Thailand and Malaysia and for the international level. The policy makers in Thailand and Malaysia are under pressure from the environmental representatives to reduce emissions although the state still faces enormous challenge to improve its income. Therefore, GDP is associated with energy consumption and energy consumption or exports or GDP will cause to CO2 emissions then policy makers in Thailand or Malaysia encounter a main dilemma as the environmental degradation through CO2 emissions would worsen the economy in the long-run. The policy makers should put higher attention to obtain alternative less polluting and renewable energy sources to meet increasing energy demands. © International Economic Society.","CO2 emissions; Energy consumption; Exports; Granger causality test; Gross domestic product (GDP)",,,,,,"Talukdar, D., Meisner, C.M., Does the private sector help or hurt the environment?

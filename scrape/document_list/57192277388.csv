Dissatisfaction and unsustainability of marriage have led the urgency of premarital education in various countries. The problem is that the spread of virtual reality has made marriage itself to become more complex and experience reinterpretation and reconfiguration, moreover with the emergence of new kind of marriage in the digital era, i.e. virtual marriage. Everybody who has observed, known, or even tried, certainly asks the question, ""Could (or: should) I accept virtual marriage?"" . This study was aimed to investigate the role of tolerance of ambiguity and illusion of intimacy in online dating in predicting the acceptance of virtual marriage. There were 420 adolescents and young adults (212 males, 208 females; Mage=21.10 years old, SDage=1.459 years; 338 students, 82 employees or entrepreneurs) in the Greater Jakarta, Indonesia, participated in this study. It was found that the acceptance was not predicted by the ambiguity tolerance, but by the illusion of intimacy in online dating. The psychometric issues, substantive discussion, and recommendation are presented at the end of this article. The trend of virtual marriage should not be allowed to roll away, by autopilot, without loaded by strategies in designing an online game as one of the pivotal educational technologies that needs to shape appropriate character and attitude for it.","Ambiguity; Intimacy illusion; Marriage psychology; Online marriage; Psychotechnology",,,,,,"Abraham, J., Sharron, S., Attitude toward game, emotional awareness, and thinking style among high school students (2015) Advanced Science Letters, 21 (6), pp. 1845-1849. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/asl.2015.6134; Abraham, J., Utami, D.P., Faza, I.R., The role of perceived uncertainty, ego identity, and perceived behavioral control in predicting patient's attitude toward medical surgery (2014) Makara Journal of Health Research, 18 (3), pp. 103-112. , http://dx.doi.org/10.7454/msk.v18i3.4021; Bailey, O., Chin, Y.-L., Cultural characteristics, social and political significance of online relationships in China (2010) Proceedings from the Asian Media & Mass Communication Conference 2010, Osaka, Japan, pp. 15-27. , http://research.sabanciuniv.edu/15068/1/MediAsia_2010_Official_Conference_Proceedings.pdf; Baj-Lindsey, C., (1998) The Tolerance of Ambiguity: An Investigation Across Attitudinal, Behavioral/motivational, and Perceptual Dimensions in Pacifist and Fundamentalist Samples (Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation), , http://www.worldcat.org/title/tolerance-of-ambiguity-an-investigation-across-attitudinal-behavioral-motivational-and-perceptual-dimensions-in-pacifist-and-fundamentalist-samples/oclc/39200601, Miami Institute of Psychology, The Caribbean Center for Advanced Studies, Miami, Florida, USA; Banyumurti, I., (2016) Internet Indonesia Dalam Angka: Kumpulan Data Statistik Tentang Internet Indonesia, , http://www.slideshare.net/banyumurti/internet-indonesia-dalam-angka-2015-2016, SlideShare; Blackhart, G.C., Fitzpatrick, J., Williamson, J., Dispositional factors predicting use of online dating sites and behaviors related to online dating (2014) Computers in Human Behavior, 33, pp. 113-118. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2014.01.022; Bors, D., Gruman, J., Shukla, S., Measuring tolerance of ambiguity: Item polarity, dimensionality, and criterion validity (2010) Revue Européenne de Psychologie Appliquée/European Review of Applied Psychology, 60 (4), pp. 239-245. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erap.2010.07.001; Bridges, J.C., (2012) The Illusion of Intimacy: Problems in the World of Online Dating, , https://books.google.co.id/books/about/The_Illusion_of_Intimacy.html?id=SIqTGKbgoOwC&redir_esc=y, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, LLC; (2005) Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary, , (2nd ed.)., Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press; Chareonwongsak, K., Globalization and technology: How will they change society?

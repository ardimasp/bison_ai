Tragically, numerous ways to deal with range detecting do not function admirably in low signal to noise ratio (SNR) situations and noise uncertainty. The GLRT approach can form other algorithms if it uses a derivation with the right assumptions. In previous research, the calculation of the GLRT approach is generally used in multi-antenna equipment, given the fact that the idea of the GLRT approach can accept multi-antenna wire parameters. Multi-antenna is used to describe the number of IoT devices because these devices are widely used in the industrial revolution now. Signal space-time block coding (MIMO-STBC-OFDM) is used as a multi-antenna signal from the primary signal (PU). Rayleigh distributed channel using a Geometric Based Single Bounce (GBSB) and also use as the multi-antenna from the secondary user (SU). This research wants to show if all algorithms derived from the GLRT approach can overcome the problem of noise uncertainty, small SNR, and choose which algorithm is very suitable for use in this condition. Simulation set up to solve issues shown by the results of the correlation multi-antenna receiver matrix (Rx) in the SU. The results show that the GLRT algorithm is robust because the GLRT approach does not require noise power assumption. On the other hand, the calculation of the algorithm using the GLRT approach shows if the algorithm can overcome the problem of vulnerability at a low SNR level and noise uncertainty. The final comparison results also show that the GLRT Kernel (KGLRT) algorithm can be stable in a multi-antenna IoT device. © 2020 IEEE.","Cognitive radio; GLRT approach; Spectrum sensing","Antennas; Block codes; Cognitive radio; Information management; Internet of things; Radio systems; Space-time block coding (STBC); Turbo codes; Comparison result; Distributed channels; Industrial revolutions; Low signal-to-noise ratio; Multi-antenna receivers; Noise uncertainties; Spectrum sensing; Wire parameters; Signal to noise ratio",,,,,,,"Qiu, R.C., Hu, Z., Li, H., Wicks, M.C., Cognitive radio network as sensors (2012) Cogn.

One of the challenges for tertiary education managers, especially human resource management, is to be able to produce graduates who are competent in their respective fields. This research was conducted in Bandung. In this case, the paper will study in one of greatest education in Bandung that was necessary to manage an information system service for the human resources administration unit, has a place to channel labor, namely BTK (Labor Market in Indonesia) or called which has been managed online. This BTK has a vital role in the distribution of employment for graduates and job creation. The use of the TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) and IDT (Innovation Diffusion Theory) models is based on the fact that so far, TAM is a concept that is considered the best and suitable in explaining user behavior towards information technology systems. This research tries to combine these methods with variables on TAM, such as Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Attitude Towards, Behavioral Intention. And also, variables from IDT such as Relative Advantage, Compatibility, Complexity, Trialability, Observability. The equation model used in this study is the SEM (Structural Equation Model) using the SPSS AMOS 22 application. The SEM model is used because, in this study, there are several variables or multiple variates.The results of this study show that BTK can be well received among students and graduate education program in Bandung. Listed with the results of hypothesis testing, which findings are quite significant. And with the results of this research, it tends to be reasoned that the labor market in the education program can help students and alumni or graduates in finding suitable jobs. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS","Higher educational institutions; Online education; Resistance to distance learning; Vocational training of educators",,,,,,,,"Mulero, O., Adeyeye, M., An empirical study of user acceptance of online social networks marketing (2013) South African Comput.

The use of spectrum is now considered very minimal and raises the problem of scarcity of spectrum. But after testing the real problem is the spectrum in utilization. This problem can be overcome by using efficient utilization of CR technology using Spectrum Sensing. Sensing algorithms that are usually used such as: a suitable filter, energy detector and cyclostationary are not enough because there are many antennas to be detected. In the case of multi-antenna detection, research usually uses the Generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) approach. The GLRT Approach Detector also has three types of detectors, type-3 detectors do not determine statistical tests. However, if you use monte carlo or the literacy algorithm, you need a lot of data to get the detector performance. this research will combine algorithms using bootstrap to determine detector performance using small data because using Bootstrap basically only requires a small resampling. The research wants to show if a type-3 detector can help the detector produce good probabilities using little data. The expected result is that the GLRT approach can be combined with a bootstrap for type-3 detectors such as: arithmetic and geometric statistical tests (TAGM) and GLRT time code space code statistical tests (TSTBCGLRT) to help determine assumptions Pd assumptions. Then an experiment was carried out to determine the threshold, by comparing bootstrap with monte carlo, research is expected to show that bootstrap works without a known H0 distribution and set the same threshold at all times. ©BEIESP.","Bootstrap; Cognitive Radio; Multi-Antenna",,,,,,,,"Derek, T., Otermat, I.K., Otero, C.E., Analysis of the fm radio spectrum for secondary licensing of low-power short-range cognitive internet of things devices (2016) IEEE Access, 4, pp. 6681-6691; Rendy, B., Understanding dynamic spectrum access: Models,taxonomy and challenges (2011) IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks, 1st, pp. 649-663; A design method of cognitive overlay links for satellite communications Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 15Th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop (ASMS/SPSC) 2018, pp. 1-6. , 9th; Annamalai, A., Energy detection of unknown deterministic signals in-and-generalized fading channels with diversity receivers (2014) International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC), pp. 761-765. , 1st; Kumar, A., Saumya Dwivedi, A.K.J., Glrt-based spectrum sensing for mimo sc-fdma cognitive radio systems in the presence of synchronization impairments (2016) IEEE Wireless Communications Letters, pp. 280-283; Islam, M.T., Muhammad Sajjad Khan, I.K., Simo-based coarse fine sensing scheme for wideband cognitive radio communication (2015) International Conference on Electrical and Electronic Engineering ICEEE, 26 (3), pp. 205-208; Fajar Nugraha Suhartono Tjondronegoro, F.Y.S., Spectrum sensing of ofdm signals using glrt detector with bootstrap approach (2015) International Conference on Telecommunication Systems Services and Applications (TSSA), 9, pp. 1-6; Suratman, F.Y., Spectrum sensing in cognitive radio: Bootstrap and sequential detection approaches (2014) Dissertation TU Darmstadt; Mohamed, S., Hadj Irid, S.K., A novel algorithm using spatial samplimg and bootstrap to estimate closed space doa for few samples (2017) International Conference on Electrical Engineering-Boumerdes (ICEE-B), pp. 1-5; Kai Feng, L.L., Source detection using bootstrap technique in spatial nonuniform noise (2015) Fourth International Conference on Instrumentation and Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control, pp. 306-310; Luo Meng, H., (2013) Threshold Estimation Method for Spectrum Sensing Using Bootstrap Technique, , Intelligent Computing Theories, Springer, 1st; Mouchini, T., Khalida Ghanem, M.D.A.Z., (2018) Bootstrap Approach for Cognitive Radio, pp. 155-158. , International Conference on Smart Communications in Network Technologies (SaCoNeT); Zeng, Glrt-based spectrum sensing forcognitive radio (2008) IEEE GLOBECOM 2008-2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, pp. 1-5. , 1st; Eigenvalue-based spectrum sensing of orthogonal space-time block coded signals (2014) IEEE Trans Signal, 60 (12)",,,,"Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication",,,,,22773878,,,,"English","Int.

IoT fit objects will be interconnected through wired and wireless communication technologies. It makes demand high. One of the solutions using cognitive radio (CR) for better utilization, CR has spectrum sensing to find unoccupied channel and occupied channel. This study using Eigen Moment Ratio (EMR) for better utilization than Energy Detection (ED). The evaluation shows EMR better than ED, because EMR using a new formula eigenvalue to detect. EMR can distinguish signal + noise from background noise only. EMR also can detect unoccupied channels in multi antennas. © 2019 IEEE","Cognitive Radio; Eigen Moment Ratio; Internet of Things","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Internet of things; Background noise; Energy detection; Internet of Things (IOT); Moment ratio; Multi antennas; Performance analysis; Spectrum sensing; Wired and wireless communications; Cognitive radio",,,,,,,"Chatterjee, S., Mukherjee, R., Ghosh, S., Ghosh, D., Ghosh, S., Mukherjee, A., Internet of things and cognitive radio- Issues and challenges (2017) International Conference on Opto-Electronics and Applied Optics (Optronix), 4, pp. 1-4; Khan, A.A., Rehmani, M.H., Rachedi, A., When cognitive radio meets the internet of things (2016) IEEE InternationallWireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conerence(IWCMC), pp. 469-474; Urkowitz, H., Energy detection of unknown deterministic signals (1967) Proc.

The sensing algorithm that usually used is the matched filter and the energy detector. Because there is a shortage in energy detector, which is very sensitive to noise power uncertainty. Then formed a new method based on the covariance matrix of the received signal. In this paper analysis on cognitive radio spectrum sensing using signal covariance matrix and energy detector. The signal space-time block coding (STBC) as a signal primary user (PU) randomly generated and then transmitted through the channel Geometrically-Based Single Bounce (GBSB). Evaluation results showed that there are several factors that influence the algorithm signal covariance matrix such as; Number of Antenna Receiver (nR), MIMO STBC scheme, Channel shape GBSB Circular and Ellips, Last algorithm signal covariance matrix resistant to noise uncertainty. © 2016 IEEE.","Cognitive Radio; Signal Covariance Matrix; Spectrum Sensing","Covariance matrix; Information theory; Matched filters; Radio systems; Signal detection; Signal receivers; Space-time block coding (STBC); Antenna receivers; Energy detectors; Evaluation results; Noise uncertainties; Received signals; Sensing algorithms; Signal covariance; Spectrum sensing; Cognitive radio",,,,,,,"Anderson, C., Dan Cameron, C.R., How empty is empty ?

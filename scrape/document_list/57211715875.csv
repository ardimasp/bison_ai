The concept of enterprise architecture is now entering a level that can be considered very tough to apply to manufacturing companies that business looks very volatile. In addition to highly competitive business issues, another problem is the very high investment infrastructure that requires an infrastructure service that expenses the cost in accordance with its use. The concept of enterprise architecture using SOA is a method that can accommodate the development of existing systems in manufacturing companies based on service oriented. Then, viewed from the side of the production system concept, generally the automotive company uses the TPS concept, namely the Toyota Production system, this concept in general is to develop products based on continuous improvement, so that the production process will continue to evolve to adjust customer needs. to support sustainable improvement, the concept of developing a flexible and effective system is needed. This SOA architecture can be used to support such production system concepts, so companies can continue to develop the production process without being hindered by the development of a complex system. © 2019 Little Lion Scientific.

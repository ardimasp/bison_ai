One of such action is data theft. Therefore, this study will discuss about cryptography and steganography that aims to overcome these problems. This study will use the Modification Vigenere Cipher, Least Significant Bit and Dictionary Based Compression methods. To determine the performance of study, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) method is used to measure objectively and Mean Opinion Score (MOS) method is used to measure subjectively, also, the performance of this study will be compared to other method such as Spread Spectrum and Pixel Value differencing. After comparing, it can be concluded that this study can provide better performance when compared to other methods (Spread Spectrum and Pixel Value Differencing) and has a range of MSE values (0.0191622-0.05275) and PSNR (60.909 to 65.306) with a hidden file size of 18 kb and has a MOS value range (4.214 to 4.722) or image quality that is approaching very good. © 2017 Author(s).","Cryptography; Dictionary Based Compression; Least Significant Bit; Modified Vigenere Cipher; Pixel Value Differencing; Spread Spectrum; Steganography",,,,,,"Abhirama, D., (2009) Keystream Vigenere Cipher: Modification Approach Vigenere Cipher with Key Stream Generator, , Bandung: Bandung Institute of Technology; Bhavana, S., Sudha, K.L., Text Steganography Using LSB Insertion Method Along with Chaos Theory (2012) International Journal of Computer Science, Engineering and Applications (IJCSEA), 2, p. 147; Lestari, D., Riyanto, M.Z., (2012) A Stream Cipher Cryptographic Algorithm Based on Chaos Function, , Yogyakarta: Yogyakarta State University; Pamungkas, B., (2007) Vigenere Cipher with Key Substitutions Based Incremental Caesar Cipher, , Bandung: Bandung Institute of Technology; Pan, J.-S., Huang, H.-C., Jain, C., Zaho, Y., (2013) L., &.

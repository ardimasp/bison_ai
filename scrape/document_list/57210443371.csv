However, the example shown from the Covid-19 quick anticipation in Wuhan, China has shown the exact opposite. The researcher tries to identify human behaviors during the pandemic situation of Covid-19 in Indonesia. The researcher argues that compared to other countries, Indonesian people have different characteristics and responses. They are more self-centered and judgmental. Using the qualitative approach, the researcher classifies the people into 4 groups during a pandemic situation with two main groups as the research priority. First, the egocentric group as the group dominating the food and medical supplies. The panic buying in Indonesia causes this group of people to pile up stocks at home and cause the retail price to rocket. The second group is the profit-seeking group who takes advantage of this situation and sells the important food and medical supply in high price. The four groups represent the chaotic society culture in Indonesia and are the main reasons for questions if the humanity still exists. This research gives an understanding to the government to face the next pandemic if it happens someday. There are two limitations. First, at the time this research is made, the Covid-19 pandemic is still ongoing. There is a high possibility that a new group might appear near or at the end of the pandemic. Second, this paper does not separate the people into groups of different income levels, age groups and gender. Future research should address these limitations. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

With the increasing population all around the world, the proper supply chain management to ensure products availability is inevitably required. Modern Manufacturing industry must put in extra efforts in all fields, especially in the supply chain management system to make the products ready on time, at the right place, for designated customers. This will certainly be not easy because the world is changing continuously. This paper aims to analyze the recent and most updated insights from the leaders in Supply Chain Network and gives new perspectives for the decision makers. Using qualitative research, this paper discusses the disruptive challenges faced by modern manufacturing industry and the preparations need to be done by all parties included in Supply Chain 4.0. The findings show that customer loyalty and customer satisfaction is no longer relevant for a successful supply chain management. Customer Experience will be the first brand differentiator in the future and must be given serious attention if we want to maintain firm performance supported by all other factors. The future research should be extended to quantitative approach by creating a proper research framework. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Customer experience; Disruption; Industry 4.0; Supply chain management; Technology",,,,,,"Haddouch, H., Beidouri, Z., El Oumami, M., Supply chain management: A review of approaches, practices and impact on performance (2019) Int.

It is believed to be the answer to competitive advantages under uncertainties. Manufacturing companies are among those who try to implement ambidexterity but with no satisfactory result. Confusion and debates on Ambidexterity are real. Previous studies have been numerous, but each of them is focused on one context only, leaving the others behind. The digitalization in Industry 4.0 has made it even worse, the companies know that they need to integrate ambidextrous capabilities but so far, the research have provided no complete step-by-step integration process. This paper aims to answer this problem by conducting systematic literature research and qualitative approach. The writer introduces an ambidexterity integration concept with 9 key steps in order to integrate ambidextrous capabilities within the small, medium and big companies with clear deadlines and goals to gain competitive advantages. We must also pay attention to the transition process in integrating ambidexterity in the manufacturing industry which may be different from other industries. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Ambidexterity; Competitive advantage; Industry 4.0; Modern manufacturing; Supply chain management",,,,,,"NagarajSubbarao, A., Al-Khoury, P., Al-Shamali, M., The new paradigm of supply chain performance: Orchestrated structure (2019) Int.

Customers are viewed as the object of firms' organizational activities to provide benefits for the company. The researcher broadens this view into a bigger perspective, where the customers are now not only becoming the objects, but also the subjects of the organizational activities. The purchase intention must move on to the next level where all actors in organizational activities are taking charge in delivering purchase intention. Human-to-human interaction has become so important in organizational activities that firms must articulate on these factors to complement the existing factors, especially during the Industry 4.0. This research uses a quantitative analysis with 91 respondents aged between 18 to 55 years old with income. The data analysis uses SPSS AMOS. The findings correlate with the newest Consumer Trend Report for 2020 and more that in the future, social interaction between humans takes a great deal in making purchase decisions, known as consumer conformity. Innovations must be done by gaining consumer insights and increasing social roles to the advantages of the firms through social comparison, image related concerns and strategic complements. This research has several limitations. First, data collection was based on convenience sampling and the second, the ideal number of respondents should be 385 based on Cochran's sampling method calculation. Future research should address these two issues. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt. Ltd.

Impulses talk about humans’ spontaneous action when facing dynamic happenings in life. This paper reviews the strategic impulses the TMTs do and decide to keep the firm performance updated and well performing. Dynamic changes occur continuously and it is essential to be able to adapt every time through continuous innovation, whether in hard – planning innovation and soft planning innovation. Though the strategic impulses are important, but it is long debated, as we can see that Impulse-driven logics are notoriously tricky to identify, isolate and describe [2] and also rational decision-making may often result in an optimal response of inaction, while impulse-driven action represents the opposite extreme, an individual logic of ‘act before you think.’ Therefore, impulse-driven entrepreneurship thusly considered suggests a breakdown in governing logic, a failure to think things through, or even foolishness [2]. The unpredictable results of Strategic impulses have left the top management in doubts whether the Strategic impulses are actually an opportunity or a threat. © BEIESP.","Firm excellence; Innovation; Opportunity; Strategic impulses",,,,,,"Simpeh, K.N., (2011) Entrepreneurship Theories and Empirical Research: A Summary Review of the Literature, 3 (6), pp. 1-9; Hunt, R.A., Lerner, D.A., (2017) Follow MUSE NON-DELIBERATIVE, UNREASONED NASCENT-STAGE Ventur; Sofka, W., (2007) ZEW Centre for European Economic Research ZEW Centre for European Economic Research.

Majority of the problems happened due to the slow respond of the firms to adapt to the market or even the changing of the trend before the products hit the market. To overcome these problems, firm are taking advantages from the online world by going online to introduce their products and innovations. Some innovations are even merely designs, and produced based on the customer requests. They trigger the online impulse buying behavior of customers and take advantage of them. This research talks about the impulse buying behavior from the customer satisfaction perspective. Being impulsive has always been considered as an irresponsible behavior, bad performance and spontaneous conduct which will lead to big disappointment. But since the year 2004, research results have shown contradictory results. Impulsive behaviour can also be advantageous for the individual and the company. The risk of losing an opportunity due to lack of necessary quick respond can be diminished. The year 2016 and after, more and more research support both opposite arguments. The researcher addresses this research gap by conducting a quantitative research to 156 respondents to address this issue by testing the relationship between impulse buying and customer satisfaction. The researcher concludes that if customer satisfaction is increased by improving management strategies and product innovations in ensuring the after-buying effects then actually impulse buying does not always give negative effects on customer satisfaction. Hence, when the customer satisfaction increases, the firm performance will increase too. © 2019, Czestochowa University of Technology.

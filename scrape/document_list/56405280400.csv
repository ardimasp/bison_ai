The proposed system consists of a microcontroller and a voice recognition processor that can recognize many voice patterns. The robot is controlled through voice recognition system which allows customers to interact with the robot, in order the robot able to shows the desired location. The advantage of voice recognition system on a robot guidance are fast data input operation and easy to use. The compass is used for navigates the robot from start to goal position. The voice recognition system is trained in such a way that it is recognizing commands and the robot navigates based on the instruction through the voice commands. Based on the experiment, the system run very well and we evaluate and show the performance of this system. © 2014 SERSC.","Navigation; Robot guidance; Voice recognition",,,,,,"Ronald, A., Behavior -Based Robotics (1998), The MIT press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, UK; Fezari, M., Bousbia-Salah, M., A voice command system for autonomous robots guidance (2006) 9th IEEE International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control, pp. 261-265. , Istanbul; Baumann, J., Voice Recognition http://www.hitl.washington.edu/scivw/EVE/I.D.2.d.VoiceRecognition.html; Kavita, S.Y., Mukhedkar, M.M., Review on Speech Recognition (2013) (IJSE) International Journal Of Science and Engineering, 1 (3), pp. 61-70; Preeti, S., Parneet, K., Automatic Speech Recognition: A Review (2013) International Journal of Engineering Trends and Technology, 4 (2); Schuler, C., Mahesh, C., Digital Signal Processing: A Hands-On Approach (2005), McGraw-Hill; http://www.veear.eu/; What's a Microcontroller?

Each of them is unique in every school and cannot be generalized although using the same curriculum. School personnel such as headmaster, teacher, and staff also not only assigned to one school location and can have multiple roles in each school location. With that complexity, a single query is not fast enough to generate a scoring report. This paper proposed the system business intelligence which can analyze the progress of student learning. This paper used nine steps to design a data warehouse as a tool business intelligence. The On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP) is used to analyze the data and visualize them using dashboard. By using data warehouse, each school can answer business question relation to scoring and visualize them in a dashboard to make a decision. © 2019 IEEE.","Business Intelligence; Data Warehouse; Report; Scoring; Socrates System School","Curricula; Data warehouses; Education management; On-line analytical processing; School location; Student learning; Information analysis",,,,,"Tarnaveanu, D., Pentaho business analytics: A business intelligence open source alternative (2012) ERP and E-Business Application Deployment in Open Source Distributed Cloud Systems; He, Y., Lee, R., Huai, Y., Shao, Z., Jain, N., Zhang, X., Xu, Z., Rcfile: A fast and space-efficient data placement structure in mapreduce-based warehouse systems (2011) Data Engineering (ICDE), 27th International Conference on, pp. 1199-1208; Tuncer, O., Van Den Berg, J., (2010) Implementing BI concepts with Pentaho, an evaluation, , Delft University of Technology.

Aim of this study is to analyze the effect of Baca Meter implementation and user ability on employee performance of Sub Bagian Pembaca Meter in PDAM Kota Balikpapan. Data collection performs by distributing questionnaires consisting of 20 questions to 36 employees of Sub Bagian Baca Meter. To evaluate the relation between variables, single and multiple linear regression were used. The result evidence, employee performance is influenced by the implementation of Baca Meter, but not influenced by the user's ability. Simultaneously, Implementation of Baca Meter and user ability influence employee performance by 37.9%, while the remaining 62.1% influenced by other variables outside this regression equation. Recommendation for next research and study is to analyze other variables which might significantly influence the employee performance of Sub Bagian Baca Meter in PDAM Kota Balikpapan. © 2020 IEEE.","Employee performance; Mobile application; User ability; Water meter","Information management; Linear regression; Surveys; Data collection; Employee performance; Mobile applications; Multiple linear regressions; Regression equation; Personnel rating",,,,,"Abbas, J., Muzaffar, A., Mahmood, H., Ramzan, M.A., Rizvi, S.S., Impact of technology on performance of employees (a case study on allied bank ltd, Pakistan) (2014) World Applied Sciences Journal, 29, pp. 271-276; Alefari, M., Fernández Barahona, A.M., Salonitis, K., Modelling manufacturing employees' performance based on a system dynamics approach (2018) Procedia CIRP, 72, pp. 438-443; Bresnahan, T.F., Trajtenberg, M., General purpose technologies 'engines of growth'?

Personal health is obtained by maintaining regular diet and exercise. However, because of the lack of public knowledge about balanced food intake and calorie requirements for daily activities, it is difficult for the community to determine the amount of calories consumed and burned. The author proposes the concept of a system that integrates Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)-based gym and logistics to solve this problem. This research methodology uses a systematic literature review. The results of this study are the big picture of service-based architecture which consists of nine layers, namely profile, order, catalog, payment, shipping, chat, diary, promotion and gym inventory. © 2019 IEEE.","Calorie Control Application; integration; Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)","Computer architecture; Information services; Integration; Nutrition; Control applications; Daily activity; Food intake; Personal health; Public knowledge; Research methodologies; Service-based; Systematic literature review; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,"(2015) Hanya 27% Penduduk Indonesia Rutin Berolahraga, , https://databoks.katadata.co.id/datapublish/2016/11/10/hanya-27-penduduk-Indonesia-rutin-berolahraga, Badan Pusat Statistik BPS.

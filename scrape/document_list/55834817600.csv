They are retrieval failure, interference failure to store and motivated forgetting. So, it is considered to have tools in order to prevent those. This happens almost everywhere, including when the drivers forgot where their car has been parked. Furthermore, the increase of parking fee is also considerable. The purpose of this research is to design a prototype system for mobile web as one of the helpful tools for car parking location reminder using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology that implemented at the parking building. The research is conducted by direct observation of the current system, do a comparison of similar applications, design the architecture of the system, make the programs, create a mock-up and mobile web as a prototype. The result of this research is a prototype of parking location reminder using RFID-based on mobile web. The mobile web displays information menu such as the location and the parking information. Based on the research, it is concluded that the mobile web can be used as one of solutions for parking location reminder and allows users to view information such as the parking duration and the parking fee estimation. © 2013 Science Publications.","Mobile web; Parking building; Prototype; RFID; System",,,,,,"Kianpisheh, A., Mustaffa, N., Limtrairut, P., Keikhosrokiani, P., Smart Parking System (SPS) architecture using ultrasonic detector (2012) Int.

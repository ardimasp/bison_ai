Pet adoption mobile application is not yet popular in Indonesia, thus the benefit of conducting this research. Within this research, a mobile application to help the pet adoption process has been developed. The mobile application is developed on Android platform and the requirements are gathered by interviews, surveys, and research that have been conducted. The mobile application developed provides convenience for those who wants to adopt or give out pets and also allows businesses in pet product industry to use the mobile application as a sales channel. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Animal adoption; E-dopt; Mobile application; Pet adoption; Pet e-dopt",,,,,,"(2017), http://www.beritasatu.com/destinasi/155725-animal-defenders-terus-berkomitmen-menyelamatkan-hewan-terlantar.html; (2017), http://repository.unika.ac.id/2046/7/09.13.0003%20Jane%20Patricia%20DAFTAR%20PUSTAKA.pdf; (2017), http://nowjakarta.co.id/how-to-help-astray-pet; Arbe, A., Relationship between sources of pet acquisition and euthanasia of cats and dogs in an animal shelter: a pilot study (2017) Australian Veterinary Journal, 95 (6). , June 2017; Curb, L., The Relationship between Personality Match and Pet Satisfaction among Dog Owners (2013) Anthrozoos, 26 (3), pp. 395-404. , Research Gate; Protopopova, A., The effects of social training and other factors on adoption success of shelter dogs (2012) Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 142, pp. 61-68. , Elsevier; (2017), http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/adopt/tips/adoption_process_what_expect.html, Retrieved from The Humane Society of The United States:; Mohan-Gibbons, H., Evaluation of a Novel Dog Adoption Program in Two US Communities (2014) PLoS ONE, 9 (3); Protopopova, A., Wynne, C., Adopter-dog interactions at the shelter: Behavioral and contextual predictors of adoption (2014) Applied Animal Behaviour Science, , Elsevier; Lansdowne, M., (2015) Apps That Help Adoptable Animals Find Forever Homes, , http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/apps-that-help-adoptable-animalsfind-forever-homes/, Retrieved from Onegreenplanet; (2017), http://adopsi.org/, Retrieved from Adopsi; (2017) Bangun Aplikasi ADOPSI, , https://kitabisa.com/adopsiapp, Retrieved from Kitabisa.com","Santy; Information Systems Department, Jl.

PMS, a company which has specialization in offshore and onshore services has many equipments to support their service operation. The equipment has been classified into four divisions, Diving, ROV, Cleaning and Painting. The problems observed in PT. PMS warehouse were their disorganized warehouse system which has no fixed layout design. For the purpose of improvement, a new warehouse layout design was proposed in this study to solve the problem. The method of modified Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) has been used to design an efficient warehouse layout. Step by step layout procedure has been done. It consists of Activity Relationship Chart and Activity Relationship Diagram that have been discussed. It is proved from this study that SLP method provides an effective method in layout designing, even in the service company that has many equipments to be stored in an efficient manner. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

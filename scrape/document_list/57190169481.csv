The method was mixed research methods with examining quantitative and qualitative data. The result showed that there was an influence between customer experience on seller loyalty Tinkerlust.com, the effect was 41, 2 percent. The sellers have sold at Tinkerlust at least three times or more. The conclusion in the element of experience that most make them loyal to the brand was a way of communication and sales system that met their expectations. This study was expected to be able to contribute to people to participate in protecting the environment in a way not consumptive in fashion shopping. © 2020 IEEE.","Customer experience; Loyalty; Prelove fashion; Seller","Information management; Customer experience; Qualitative data; Sales",,,,,"(2020), https://www.preloved.co.uk/blog/inspiration/the-rise-of-prelovedfashion/, Accessed; (2018) Shopping Behavior in the Indonesian E-commerce, , Snapchart Snapchart, Jakarta; Zati, R.M., Iqbal, M., Pengaruh pengalaman terhadap loyalitas konsumen di alfamart langsa (2017) Jurnal Samudra Ekonomi Dan Bisnis, 8, pp. 749-759; Mayer, C., Schwager, A., Mayer, C., Schwager, A., Understanding customer experience (2007) Harvard Business Review, , February, Brigton, Massachusetts; Rhea, D.., (2015) Experiential Marketing: A New Framework for Design and Communications by Bernd Schmitt, 20-21, pp. 20-24. , Washington DC, Free Press Design Management Institute; Logahan, J.M., (2015) Costumer Experience Management, , https://sbm.binus.ac.id, 29 October; Bilgihan, A., Gen y customer loyalty in online shopping: An integrated model of trust (2016) User Experience and Branding, 61, pp. 103-113. , August; Rahayu, E.M., (2018) Transaksi Barang Preloved Makin Digemari, , https://kumparan.com, Juni; Schmitt, B.H., (2011) Experiental Marketing: How to Get Customers to Sense, Feel, Think, Act, Relate to Your Company and Brands, , New York: The Free Press; Nasermoadeli, A., Choon, L.K., Maghnati, F., Evaluating the impacts of customer experience on purchase intention (2012) International Journal of Business and Management, 8, pp. 128-138; Schwager, A., Meyer, C., Understanding customer experience in whose strategy is it?

Response Surface Method (RSM) was used to optimize process conditions of pre-treatment (delignification). Hydrolysis for all pretreated sample were carried out using 3% H2SO4 with a ratio of cocoa pod husk to solvent (1:10) for 2 hours at a temperature of 110 oC using an autoclave. The chemical pre-treatment with NaOH was optimized by varying the concentrations of NaOH (4-8% (w/v), centre point: 6%), reaction time (60-100 minutes, centre point: 80 minutes) and ratio of biomass to solvent (1:15-1:25, centre point 1:20 w/v). The optimum conditions in this study was at the concentration of NaOH (X1) of 4% w/v, reaction time (X2) of 100 minutes; ratio of biomass/solvent (X3) of 1:25 (w/v). The lignin content after pre-treatment was 15.03% lignin, lignin content after hydrolysis was 19.57%, 11.75% of reducing sugar, and 12.78% of total sugar. The chemical pre-treatment with alkaline peroxide (H2O2) was optimized by varying the concentrations of H2O2 (4-7% w/v, centre point 5.5% (w/v)), reaction time (40-90 minutes, centre point: 65 minutes), and ratio of biomass/solvent (4-7% w/v). The optimum conditions in this study was at the concentration of H2O2 concentration (X1) of 5.52% w/v, reaction time (X2) of 61.97 minutes, biomass loading in solvent (X3) 7% w/v. The lignin content after pre-treatment was 8.759, lignin content after hydrolysis was 25.029%, 8.169% of reducing sugar, and 10.371% of total sugar. The chemical pre-treatment with H2SO4 was optimized by varying the concentrations of H2SO4 (0.5-1.5% w/v), reaction time (60-120 minutes, centre point: 90 minutes), and ratio of biomass to solvent (1:4-1:6 w/v, centre point 1:5 w/v). The optimum conditions was reached without hydrolysis. The optimum condition this study is at the H2SO4 concentration (X1) of 1.5%, reaction time (X2) of 120 minutes, ratio of biomass/solvent (X3) of 6%. The lignin content after pre-treatment was 18.8%, 15.59% of reducing sugar and 20.49% of total sugar.","Bioethanol; Chemical pre-treatment; Cocoa pod; Optimization; Response surface method",,,,,,"Adzimah, S.K., Asian, E.K., Design of Cocoa Pod Splitting Machine (2010) Res.

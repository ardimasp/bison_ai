By taking samples from South Korea Country, then we were using the data mining process for classifying problems by optimizing the decision tree model from RapidMiner Studio educational 9.6.00 edition. Based on our study showed that the accuracy of this model is 80.46% +/- 1.68% (micro average 80.46%). The result for this study showed that location or region is a dominant factor rather than age and sex, therefore the South Korea policy to take the drive-through, walk-through, tracing, and use digital maps to let society aware is effective to prevent the spreads of diseases. The Implication of this study reconfirms that stay away from an infected area or social distancing such as staying at home is the right decision to minimize and reduce pandemic spreads, and other countries can adopt or modify the strategy that already did in South Korea. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Data Mining; Decision Tree Model; SARS CoV2; South Korea",,,,,,"Coronavirus Update (Live): 110, 099 Cases and 3, 831 Deaths from COVID-19 Wuhan China Virus Outbreak - Worldometer, , https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/, (accessed Mar. 09, 2020); Higgins-Dunn Noah, B.

This relatively new study program faces many challenges in creating graduates who will become a successful entrepreneur. It is expected that with a good GPA, graduates of this study program have a higher chance of becoming successful entrepreneurs. This study tries to predict the GPA from existing datasets using data mining techniques with classification methods. There are several variables involved to predict GPA, namely, attendance, gender, school origin, motivation score, capability score, and observation score. For the last three variables, the data is taken from interview when the student went through an admission selection process. There are three algorithms tested, namely Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Deep Learning. Using RapidMiner, the result from model validation shows that Naïve Bayes algorithm has the highest accuracy for this dataset. The model shows that although the number of female students is smaller but the number of female students whose GPA is above 3.00 is higher than male student because females are more willing to attend lectures. Despite having good capability and attitude, if the students are reluctant to attend the class then it is likely that the GPA students will be below 3.00. This study provides an overview of the use of data mining techniques to predict GPA using the Naive Bayes algorithm. In addition, it is expected that educational institutions can pay more attention to the attendance of their students in class, create teaching strategies that are able to make students present in class, especially for male students. © 2020 Horizon Research Publishing.

The research finding demonstrates that environmental knowledge, eco-label, and perceived quality had positive correlations with green awareness customers. Out of all the factors that influence green awareness, eco-label of the customer maintains the most determining impact on green awareness improvement.

With the various advantages of advertising on social media, making it very suitable for MSMEs. The use of video as a format for delivering advertising messages is also rife because of the faster internet speed. However, the cost of making ads in the form of videos is relatively more expensive so it needs a lot of consideration when making it be efficient. One thing that advertisers often pay attention to on social media is the click-through rate. This variable becomes one of the measures of the effectiveness of an advertisement. Hence predicting click-through rate is become important nowadays for advertisers, especially to those who have budget constraints. This research tries to predict the click-through rate using data mining techniques. This paper use CRISP method. The dataset was taken from a Facebook advertisement from a small-medium enterprise in Indonesia. Video watches at 25%, 50%, 75%,95% and 100% is use as predictors. The results show that data mining can be used to predict the click-through rate using video watches percentage. Deep learning is the most suitable model for this prediction. The interpretation of the results from data mining is done and managed to find the variables that support the predictions and contradict the predictions. © BEIESP.","Advertising; Click-through rate; Data mining; Deep learning; Social media",,,,,,"Statista, , https://www.statista.com/statistics/284437/indonesia-social-network-penetration/; https://www.statista.com/statistics/268136/top-15-countries-based-on-number-of-facebook-users/, Statista.

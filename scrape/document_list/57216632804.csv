This behavior in turn reflects the user's personality. In this paper, we experiment to automatically predict user's personality based on Big Five Personality Trait on Twitter. Our focus is towards Indonesian user. Not only word n-gram, Twitter metadata is also used in a certain combination to determine the feature that will be used to predict the personality. Our research also attempts to find optimum setting based on the number of n-gram, classifier, and twitter metadata. Our experiment yields 0.7482 at most on F-Measure. We conclude that among all scenario, twitter metadata is the least impactful feature, while word n-gram impacts the most. © 2019 The Korean Institute of Intelligent Systems.","Big five; Personality prediction; Social media; Twitter",,,,,,"Back, M.D., Stopfer, J.M., Vazire, S., Gaddis, S., Schmukle, S.C., Egloff, B., Gosling, S.D., Facebook profiles reflect actual personality, not self-idealization (2010) Psychological Science, 21 (3), pp. 372-374. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797609360756; Wu, Y., Kosinski, M., Stillwell, D., Computer-based personality judgments are more accurate than those made by humans (2015) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 112 (4), pp. 1036-1040. , https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1418680112; Plank, B., Hovy, D., Personality traits on twitter-or-how to get 1, 500 personality tests in a week (2015) Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis, pp. 92-98. , http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/W15-2913, Lisbon, Portugal; Digital 2019: Indonesia, , https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2019-indonesia; Digital in 2018 in Southeast Asia, , https://slideshare.net/wearesocial/digital-in-2018-in-southeast-asia-part-2-southeast-86866464; Digital in 2017: Southeast Asia, , https://www.slideshare.net/wearesocialsg/digital-in-2017-southeast-asia; Digital in 2016, , https://www.slideshare.net/wearesocialsg/digital-in-2016/224; Digital, Social & Mobile in 2015, , https://www.slideshare.net/wearesocialsg/digital-social-mobile-in-2015; Celli, F., Lepri, B., Is big five better than MBTI?

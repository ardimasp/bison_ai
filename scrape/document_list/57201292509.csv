The Company has implemented Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) since 2010 to support its business operations and consolidated financial reporting. The Company has implemented Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) since 2010 to support its business operations and consolidated financial reporting. After go Live ERP, there is a increasing of audit findings from year to year both audit financial reports generated by ERP and IT audits related to internal control of ERP systems that impact on data integrity of ERP systems. The accuracy of financial statements or data integrity generated by the system is needed to as a basis for strategic decision making business quickly and appropriately by management in order to become more competitive company [1]. This case study aims to determine whether the implementation of the ERP system has provided benefits to the business through the identification of factors affecting the implementation of the ERP system. Through the development of modification model DeLone & McLean which this model to review the success of information systems. The results of these reviews resulted in an understanding of factors related to dimension factors that can measure the success of information systems and be an alternative solution to improve the ERP system. Through analysis of regression statistic test based on SEM (Structural Equation Model) model through data processing research derived from the questionnaire with the number of 97 respondents then the conclusion of the results of this study include that the system use factor is influenced by the quality system, user satisfaction factor is influenced by system quality, net benefit factor are influenced by information quality, system use, and user satisfaction in the PTMD Group. The contribution of this research was performed by evaluation process both for quality of ERP system and IT support team based on result of the research. In the other hand, the service quality had been re-reviewed to optimize IT support benefit. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Delone & Mclean model dimensions; ERP system; Information system success model; SEM",,,,,,"Artit, K., Management Information System Implementation Challenges, Success Key Issues, Effects and Consequences: A Case Study of Fenix System (2012) Jokoping Int.

This is very important because the employee tacit knowledge is potentially lost (knowledge walkout) due to employee turnover during a company's knowledge is not well documented using the system. PT Mahadana Dasha Utama (MahaDasha) is one of the company has been adopting e-learning system. MahaDasha is an investment holding company with several business units. MahaDasha uses open source moodle learning management system technology platform. The idea is triggered by the company's efficiency program in information technology investment both infrastructure and application development so it enforce MahaDasha’s IT team to find out the best innovation solution by optimizing open source technology which suitable with the user's need. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of e-learning adoption based on open source moodle technology platform by developing The DeLone & McLean Information Success Model and empirically measured the relation between aspect of information quality, system quality, service quality, user readiness and user satisfaction. The quantitative data are gained through questionnaire by distributing the questionnaires to all MahaDasha employees who use e-learning. The analysis of data indicated that the user satisfaction is the most positive influenced by information quality and user readiness. The contribution of this research was performed by evaluation process both for quality of trainer and IT support team based on result of the research. In the other hand, the system quality had been re-reviewed whether moodle application is suitable or not for user needs in MahaDasha. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS","Application; E-learning; Knowledge management system; Learning management system; Open source",,,,,,"Jafari, S.M., Salem, S.F., Moaddab, M.S., Salem, S.O., Learning Management System (LMS) success: An investigation among the university students (2016) 2015 IEEE Conf.

The reporting system commonly used utilizes query which consumes a large amount of time in order to generate results fulfilling requirements set by the user. In order to simplify and speed up reporting in digital world and eventually results in improvement of business, the business entity needs a system which can address problems quickly and easily. In this paper, data warehouse system which could simplify and speed up the reporting provisions that is needed by the business without having to modify the existing query being implemented.

To appeal to their current and potential customers, a company must understand the market interests. Companies can segment their customers by using surveys and telemetry data to get to know the customer’s interests. One way of segmenting the customer is by grouping or clustering them according to their interests and behaviors. In this study, the k-prototypes clustering algorithm, which is an improved combination of k-means and k-modes algorithm, will be used to cluster a behavioral data that contains both numerical and categorical attribute, obtained from a survey conducted on teenagers into clusters of 4, 5, and 6. Each cluster will contain teenagers with certain behavior different from other clusters. And then by analyzing the results, advertisers will be able to define a profile that indicates their interests regarding the internet, social media and text messaging, effectively revealing the kind of ad that would be relatable for them. © BEIESP.","Behavioral data; Cluster Analysis; Interest; K-Prototypes",,,,,,"Lenhart, A., Mobile access shifts social media use and other online activities (2015) Teens, Social Media & Technology Overview, , http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/09/mobile-access-shifts-social-media-use-and-other-online-activities/; Wright, E., Khanfar, N.M., Harrington, C., Kizer, L.E., The Lasting Effects Of Social Media Trends On Advertising (2016) J.

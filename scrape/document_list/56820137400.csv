One of the most prominent financial technology in Indonesia is e-wallet. Due to this, understanding factors, which influence users; intention to use and user satisfaction toward the use of e-wallet is essential. This study will apply the Modified DeLone-McLean IS Success Model, which explains customers' perspectives in terms of Behavioral Intention to Use and User Satisfaction with factors including Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Information Quality, and Service Quality. The research approach of this study is quantitative mono-method with a survey as the data collection method. The total respondents collected are 123 users, with the total valid samples used in this research are 107 respondents. Data analysis used in this research includes the reliability and data validity tests. In order to perform data analysis, Partial Least Squares (PLS) is utilized in providing relevant findings that would answer the research question. The hypothesis testing shows that Performance Expectancy influences Behavioral Intention to Use due to the fact that people is becoming more familiar with e-wallet and its benefits. E-wallet provides convenience for users to make a purchase. The result correlates with the expectation theory, which indicates that the confirmation of users' expectation will lead to their satisfaction toward the system (Fuksa, 2003). The finding suggests that Performance Expectancy is the most influential factor in determining both users' Behavioral Intention to Use and User Satisfaction toward the use of e-wallet. © 2020 IEEE.","Behavioural intention to use; DeLone-McLean IS success model; E-wallet; Effort expectancy; Information quality; Performance expectancy; Service quality; User satisfaction; UTAUT","Customer satisfaction; Data handling; Fintech; Information analysis; Information management; Least squares approximations; Reliability analysis; Service industry; Behavioral intention; Data collection method; Financial services industries; Hypothesis testing; Influential factors; Information quality; Partial least square (PLS); Research questions; Electronic money",,,,,"Prawirasasra, K.P., Financial technology in Indonesia: Disruptive or collaborative (2018) Report on Economics and Finance, 4 (2), pp. 83-90; (2015) Cleared for Takeoff-Five Megatrends That Will Change Financial Services', , Deloitte; McWaters, R.J., Bruno, G., Lee, A., Blake, M., The future of financial services-how disruptive innovations are reshaping the way financial services are structured, provisioned and consumed (2015) World Economic Forum; Pachpande, B.R., Kamble, A.A., Study of e-wallet awareness and its usage in mumbai (2018) Journal of Commerce & Management Thought, 9 (1), pp. 33-45; (2017) Penetrasi & Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia 2017, , Asosiasi Penyelenggara Jasa Internet Indonesia; (2018) The Little Data Book 2018 on Financial Inclusion, , World Bank; Pranata, N., Uluwiyah, A., Sinaga, A.S.R., Mockler, A., Ringrod, K., Assessing the impact of digital opportunity on financial inclusion (2018) The Eighth Research Dive on Financial Inclusion, p. 19; Pradibta, H., Acceptance of Mobile Payment Application in Indonesia; Chandra, Y.U., Bank vs telecommunication e-wallet: System analysis, purchase, and payment method of go-mobile cimb niaga and t-cash telkomsel (2017) 2017 International Conference on Information Management and Technology (ICIMTech), pp. 165-170; Azizah, N., Handayani, P.W., Azzahro, F., Factors influencing continuance usage of mobile wallets in Indonesia (2018) 2018 International Conference on Information Management and Technology (ICIMTech), pp. 92-97; Delone, W.H., McLean, E.R., The delone and mclean model of information systems success: A ten-year update (2003) Journal of Management Information Systems, 19 (4), pp. 9-30; Venkatesh, V., Morris, M.G., Davis, G.B., Davis, F.D., User acceptance of information technology: Toward a unified view (2003) MIS Quarterly, pp. 425-478; Omarini, A., (2017) The Digital Transformation in Banking and the Role of FinTechs in the New Financial Intermediation Scenario'; Lemon, K.N., Verhoef, P.C., Understanding customer experience throughout the customer journey (2016) Journal of Marketing, 80 (6), pp. 69-96; Mohsan, F., Nawaz, M.M., Khan, M.S., Shaukat, Z., Aslam, N., Impact of customer satisfaction on customer loyalty and intentions to switch: Evidence from banking sector of Pakistan (2011) International Journal of Business and Social Science, 2 (16); Das, K., Tamhane, T., Vatterott, B., Wibowo, P., Wintels, S., (2018) The Digital Archipelago: How Online Commerce Is Driving Indonesia's Economic Development, , McKinsey & Company, August; Indonesian consumer insights: The growing price of maintaining customer loyalty (2017) Snapcart Website, , Snapcart; Embracing bricks and clicks in Indonesia (2017) Deloitte, , Deloitte, 2017; Delone, W.H., Mclean, E.R., Measuring e-commerce success: Applying the delone & mclean information systems success model (2004) International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 9 (1), pp. 31-47; Rogers, E.M., Diffusion of innovations: Modifications of a model for telecommunications (1995) Die Diffusion von Innovationen in der Telekommunikation, pp. 25-38. , Springer; Leong, L.-Y., Hew, T.-S., Ooi, K.-B., Wei, J., Predicting mobile wallet resistance: A two-staged structural equation modeling-artificial neural network approach (2019) International Journal of Information Management, p. 102047; Seetharaman, A., Kumar, K.N., Palaniappan, S., Weber, G., Factors influencing behavioural intention to use the mobile wallet in Singapore (2017) Journal of Applied Economics & Business Research, 7 (2); Intarot, P., Beokhaimook, C., Influencing Factor in E-Wallet Acceptant and Use'; Saunders, M., Lewis, P., Thornhil, A., (2016) Research Method for Business, , 7th ed.

Among others, XBRL filings is expected to result in higher accuracy, validity and transparency of data, cost efficiency, as well as lower information asymmetry in the capital market. A total of 6-year period, which consists of pre-XBRL period (2012-2014) and post-XBRL period (2016-2018) from 65 companies were observed. Control variables included in this study are firm size, stock price and trading volume. The data analysis method used in this study is multiple regression analysis. Contrary to the hypothesis proposed, the result of multiple regression analysis shows no evidence that XBRL adoption reduces information asymmetry in Indonesia. This could be due to the fact that Indonesia is still in early stage of XBRL reporting and considered as early adopters. It might take several years before stakeholders could benefit from XBRL filings in corporate financial reporting. © 2020 IEEE.","IDX; Information asymmetry; XBRL","Financial markets; Information management; Regression analysis; Bid-ask spread; Control variable; Cost efficiency; Data analysis methods; Financial reporting; Information asymmetry; Multiple regression analysis; Trading volumes; Commerce",,,,,"Debreceny, R., Gray, G.L., The production and use of semantically rich accounting reports on the internet: Xml and xbrl (2001) International Journal of Accounting Information Systems, 2 (1), pp. 47-74; Lambert, R.A., Leuz, C., Verrecchia, R.E., (2009) Information Asymmetry, Information Precision, and the Cost of Capital, , Working paper 14881 National Bureau of Economic Research; Armstrong, C.S., Core, J.E., Taylor, D.J., Verrecchia, R.E., When does information asymmetry affect the cost of capital?

The measure of systemic risk is based on SRisk by Acharya et al. (2012) which is available in the NYU Stern V-Lab. XBRL is a dummy variable, in which 0 represents a pre XBRL adoption period (2007-2008) while 1 represents an XBRL reporting environment (2011-2012). It is further interacted with Corporate Governance, which is measured using an index developed by Brown & Caylor (2006).

Using a sample of LQ45 listed firms in the period 2010-2011; we find that increasing voluntary disclosure reduces firms’ cost of equity capital. The result persists even after we control with other common variables influencing cost of equity. This result supports findings from prior research in emerging countries. Thus, it could be conjectured that, regardless of the efficiency of the financial reporting environment, voluntary disclosure does reduce information asymmetry, which leads to lower cost of equity. Further analysis shows that based on voluntary disclosure categorization by Botosan only a firm’s background information significantly reduces the firm’s cost of equity, while other voluntary disclosures appear to be unrelated to cost of equity. The result is explained by institutional theory. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

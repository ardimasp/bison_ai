The data that used and processed from Public Complaint Handling business process observation, interpretation, documents, reports, and interview with users and experts. The data is processed by compared both functions in the main business process of Public Complaint Handling and perform feature analysis using FODA. The results of this study that the Judicial Commission simplify and refine the functions in the main business process of Public Complaint Handling based on Judicial Commission decree no. 2 2015. From the features analysis results there are 125 features with 86 mandatory features, 7 optional features, 17 features OR and 15 alternative features. This study as one of highly recommendation for Judicial Commission that FODA's approach will be more effective and efficiency in enhancing and developing applications from reusable features to be developed and new features to be built when there are regulatory changes and business process changes for the application of Public Complaint Handling. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Business Process; Feature Analysis; FODA",,,,,,"Autheman, V., Elena, S., GLOBAL BEST PRACTICES: Judicial Councils (2004) IFES Rule of Law White Paper Series, , Lessons Learned From Europe and Latin America, USAID; Bae, J., (2004) A Method to Generate a Feature Model from a Business Process Model for Business Applications, , Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea; Rositawati, D., (2015) KY Jilid III: Pekerjaan Rumah Yang Belum Selesai, , http://www.hukumonline.com/berita/baca/lt567b8b9c717f1/ky-jilid-iii--pekerjaan-rumah-yang-belum-selesai-broleh--dian-rositawati-, December; Kang, K.C., Cohen, S.G., Hess, J.A., Novak, W.E., Spencer Peterson, A., (1990) Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis (FODA) Feasibility Study, , Pennsylvania: Software Engineering Institute; Pamungkas, B., Laporan Hasil Identifikasi dan Analisa Sistem, Tugas, Prosedur, Alur Kerja, serta Praktek Penanganan Laporan Masyarakat Komisi Yudisial Republik Indonesia (2015) Aipj-Australia Indonesia Partnership for Justice, , Jakarta; Weske, M., (2007) Business Process Management: Concepts, Languages, Architectures; Caetano, A., Zacarias, M., Silva, A.R., Tribolet, J., A Role-Based Framework for Business Process Modeling (2005) Proceedings of the 38Th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 1-7; Aguilar-Saven, R.S., Business process modelling: Review and framework (2004) Int.

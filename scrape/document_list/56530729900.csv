On the other hand, the researchers say the use of information systems is assessed to be able to increase the competitive advantage for the organization. This research aimed to analyze the influence of IS adoption and IS capability toward IS innovation and IS strategic planning as well as its implication for the competitive advantage of private HEI. The research method used is explanatory survey and analysis technique of the research is structural equation modeling (SEM) with SmartPLS software. The research was conducted on private HEI in Kopertis Region III and Kopertis Region IV with more than 10000 students. The sample of research is 151 respondents consisting of management of the private HEI from Rector / Chairman, Dean, Head of Department, Chief of Bureau / Technical Implementing Unit / Lab. Research result showed that the adoption of IS did not give a direct influence on the competitive advantage of private HEI, but it can influence when reinforced with IS innovation and IS strategic planning. Variable of IS capability, IS innovation and IS strategic planning give an influence on the competitive advantage of private HEI. Based on the research result, it can be concluded that IS innovation becomes a fundamental element in creating a competitive advantage of private HEI. © 2016 IEEE.","competitive advantage; IS adoption; IS capability; IS innovation; IS strategic planning","Education; Information management; Information systems; Strategic planning; Competitive advantage; IS adoption; IS capabilities; IS innovations; Is strategic planning; Competition",,,,,"Hooper, S., Rieber, L.P., Teaching with technology (1995) Teaching: Theory into Practice, pp. 154-170. , A.

The existence of internet as an information provider has opened the horizon about the growth of IT. Nowadays, students already know about the latest technology and how to use it, but the problem is some of lecturers still don’t update about technology, especially to improve teaching and learning process, such as multimedia, animation, etc. By using IT, lecturer can perform in better way to delivery materials to the students. This paper discusses several tools of IT that have been used and haven’t use by lecturers in class and to interact with students outside class. This study conducted by interview and survey to several lecturers at some private universities in Jakarta to know about IT implementation in universities and come up with the alternatives of IT tools and training to improve lecturers performance that can help the learning process as well as the overall faculty performance. If lecturers understand how to use IT tools optimally, they and can create new trend as technological advances in education industry. The conclusion is that information technology has huge impact to improve lecturer performance in delivering materials to the students that can improve the quality of the students. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT & LLS.

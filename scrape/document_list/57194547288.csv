This game will be made to be played in a personal computer (PC). The pictures used are 2D pictures with 2D animation and audio to attract students to play the game and learn mathematics. There are 4 mini games which will be developed based on the previous research. The data collection methods used were questionnaires, literature studies, interviews, and game trials. Results show that students prefer to learn mathematics while playing game. This game has been tested by primary students and runs smoothly. The materials delivered by the game are also easily understood by students. At the end of this research, it is expected that this educational mathematics game will become an alternative media which will complement the conventional learning method. © 2017 IEEE.","elementary students; games education; mathematics educational game","Animation; Computer games; Information management; Personal computers; Surveys; 2D animation; Data collection method; Educational game; Elementary students; Learning methods; Literature studies; Mathematics games; Students",,,,,"Aprilia, N., (2014) Peran Pembelajaran Kelas Alam Dalam Meningkatkan Prestasi Belajar Siswa Mata Pelajaran Fikih Kelas X MA Bilingual YPPM Al Manah Krian Sidoarjo; Bernier, F., Enhancing stress management skills in military personnel using biofeedback (2011) Journal of CyberTherapy and Rehabilitation, 209; De Kloet, E.R., Stress and the brain: From adaptation to disease (2005) Nat.

The game is set to be released on personal computers (PC). The art of the game is set as 2D cartoon art. There will be 4 teaching methods that will help students learn mathematics in the game in the form of mini games. Each of these methods is the result of a previous research on math education for children. To date, the current development only covers 2 of 4 mini games. Questionnaire, literature study, and expert opinions are used as the data collection method. The Object Oriented approach, particularly the Inheritance Concept is used as the programming method. At the moment, a prototype education game code named Binus Math Education Game (B-Meg) is ready to be deployed. This particular education game is expected to provide an alternative and more innovative teaching method for mathematics in elementary school, or better, replace the existing conventional teaching method. © 2016 IEEE.","B-Meg; Education Game; Math; Teaching Method","Computer games; Information management; Object oriented programming; Personal computers; Students; Teaching; Data collection method; Education game; Elementary schools; Innovative teaching; Literature studies; Math; Object oriented approach; Teaching methods; Education",,,,,"Chiong, C., Shuler, C., Learning: Is there an app for that (2010) Investigations of Young Children's Usage and Learning with Mobile Devices and Apps, , New York: The Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop; Sense Media, C., Rideout, V., Zero to eight: Children's media use in America (2011) Common Sense Media; Rideout, V., Lauricella, A., Wartella, E., Children, media, and race: Media use among White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian American children (2011) Evanston, IL: Center on Media and Human Development, School of Communication, , Northwestern University; Amirali, M., Students' conceptions of the nature of mathematics and attitudes towards mathematics learning (2010) Journal of Research and Reflections in Education, 4 (1); Dryden, G., Vos, J., (2001) Revolusi Cara Belajar, , Bandung : Mizan Media Utama (MMU); Depdiknas, (2003) Pedoman Khusus Pengembangan Silabus Dan Penilaian Matematika, , Jakarta: Depdiknas; Rahadi, A., (2003) Media Pembelajaran, , Jakarta: Departemen Pendidikan Nasional; Gerlach, V.S., Elly, D.P., (1971) Teaching Media A Systematic Approach, , 2nd Ed.

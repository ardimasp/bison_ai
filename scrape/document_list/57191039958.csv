This case study of university students in Jakarta involved 235 students (128 male, 97 female). Results of this qualitative study showed 96% preference for mobile-based learning. A further 94% showed the needs for collaboration and authenticity for 92%. Hofstede's cultural dimensions were used to identify the gender aspects of MALL. Preference for Masculinity (65%) was showed rather than Femininity (35%), even among the female respondents (70% of the population). Professions and professionalism received strongest preference (70%) while Individuality and Collectivism had equal preferences among students. Both female and male respondents requested Indulgence (84%) for mobile-based learning with more male respondents opted for Indulgence. The study provided a model for this gender sensitive mobile-based learning. Implications of implementing mobile-based learning as an ideal alternative for well-accommodated education are is also discussed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"E-learning; Students; Hofstede's cultural dimensions; Jakarta; Qualitative study; University students; Education computing",,,,,,"Blake, R.J., (2011) Ann.

What cultural knowledge and whose culture are represented in these textbooks become a critical issue because culture interweaves both language and thought. With this in mind, this study aims to examine how Indonesian cultural diversity and whose cultures are represented in middle school English textbooks. We argue that diversity and multicultural perspectives represented in these textbooks are the core of English language learning and teaching. We also contend that language textbooks play a pivotal role in the acquisition of both linguistic and cultural knowledge of English. Drawing on Kress and Van Leeuwen's (2006) semiotic approach to analyzing textual and non-textual representations of cultures, we found that the 2013 English textbooks for Grades 7 and 8 permeate Indonesian cultural values and practices that do not provide a balanced and equal depiction of Indonesian cultural diversity. The findings suggest the importance of inclusive representation of the richness of Indonesian local culture in a more salient manner, especially those of minority groups. Pedagogically, teachers are expected to design language materials with cultural sensitivity and appropriation for the inclusiveness of other cultural values that might not be covered in the textbooks. © 2018, IJAL.","Cultural diversity; English teaching; English textbooks; Middle school; Semiotic analysis",,,,,"Ohio State University, OSU","The first author would like to extend his gratitude to the Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) for supporting his doctoral study at the Ohio State University, USA.

In a different context such as foreign language learning, a study by Cox and Davies (2012) found that such technology could be used to predict the speaking competency of a group of students for a language training program. To extend the context of the study, we investigated whether the online speech recognition technology would show impacts in helping EFL students’ language competency in two skills: Speaking and Writing. In our experimental—observation study, an online speech recognition technology, https://dictation.io/ was used as medium for students to give a small talk about assigned topics used in English high stake tests and have it transcribed the talk into texts. The nature of speaking and writing of the online application made it possible for us to analyze both the spoken and written expressions that students used. The students’ responses were then evaluated through the range of vocabulary and expressions they used, their fluency in expressing ideas and their accuracy in producing the sentences. By using http://www.paperrater.com/the result displays the results of students’ writing and speaking skills, as well as the language accuracy from the spoken texts they produced. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","English speaking competency; English writing competency; Speech recognition",,,,,,,"Biber, D., Conrad, S., Reppen, R., Byrd, P., Helt, M., (2012) TESOL Quarterly, 36, p. 9; Cox, T.L., Davies, R.S., (2012) CALICO Journal, 29, p. 601; Dewi, I.D., Rifai, I., Suprato, D., Free online high stake english test exercises: The evaluation, the learning/the teaching methods (2014) A Research Paper Presented at the 14Th Asianefl Conference in the Philippines; Halpern, L., (1984) College Composition and Communication, p. 35; Horner, B., Lu, M.Z., Royster, J.J., Trimbur, J., (2011) College English, p. 73; Yun, K.A., Costantini, C., Bilingsley, S., (2012) Communication Research Reports, p. 29","Dewi, I.I.; Bina Nusantara University, Jl.

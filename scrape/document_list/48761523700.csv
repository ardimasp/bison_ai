Reported by the daily Republika.co.id, in 2013, Telkomsel operators claimed to have lost up to Three billion rupiahs more due to the theft of BTS batteries in only a few districts and cities in South Sulawesi. Therefore it is necessary to evaluate the method of using technology to prevent damage. The vandalism prevention system can design by utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The design uses a Raspberry Pi computing module, which is accompanied by a GSM transmission module to send a response signal to the motion captured by the camera.

Plants need to capture photons as energy for photosynthesis in 400nm - 780nm spectrum. Different plant species will respond differently to specific light spectrum. Many studies have been done to find optimal light spectrum for plant growth, but there are still many researches to be done because there are still many combinations of light and plants species to be discovered. Specific light spectra combination is called light recipe. This research will help botanist to discover new light recipe for plant species by mixing 6 light spectra with individual intensity and time control. The developed grow light system has graphical user interface that run in Android tablet, and uses MQTT protocol for communication between android application and grow light system. Light recipe and setting are stored in database and the system also has light sensor to monitor light environmental conditions. Grow light consists of 6 types of 3W high power LED with specific color spectrum: Royal Blue, Deep Red, Ultraviolet, Full Spectrum, Far Red, and Natural White. Testing result shows that the system can produce uniform light distribution across the 50 x 50 cm grow area on average 22.6 μmol m-2s-1 using 60° lens. Germination result of lettuce using grow light shows good results compared to sunlight. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Artificial grow light; LED; MQTT; PAR","Android (operating system); Cultivation; Graphical user interfaces; Light emitting diodes; Android applications; Design and implementations; Environmental conditions; High power LED; Leafy vegetables; Light distribution; MQTT; Vegetative growth; Light",,,,"Binus University: 109/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019, 23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019, 038/VR","This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia, as a part of National Competitive Research Grant to Binus University titled “Integrated Hydroponic Automation System Design using Real Time OS based on ARM Cortex-M Microcontroller” with contract number: 109/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019, 23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019, 038/VR.RTT/IV/2019.","Kozai, T., Fujiwara, K., Runkle, E.S., (2016) LED Lighting for Urban Agriculture; Darkó, É., Heydarizadeh, P., Schoefs, B., Sabzalian, M., Photosynthesis under artificial light: The shift in primary and secondary metabolism (2014) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series B, Biological Sciences, 369; Snowden, M., Cope, K., Bugbee, B., Sensitivity of Seven Diverse Species to Blue and Green Light: Interactions with Photon Flux (2016) PLOS ONE, 11; Bantis, F., Ouzounis, T., Radoglou, K., Artificial LED lighting enhances growth characteristics and total phenolic content of Ocimum basilicum, but variably affects transplant success (2016) Scientia Horticulturae, 198; Byun, A., Mao, M., Sidhu, R., The Effect of Different Wavelenghts on the Germination time of Arabidopis thaliana wild type and mutant type seeds (2013) The Expedition, 3; Demotes, S., Péron, T., Corot, A., Bertheloot, J., Gourrierec, J., Travier, S., Crespel, L., Sakr, S., Plant responses to red and far-red lights, applications in horticulture (2015) Environmental and Experimental Botany, 309; Deram, P., Lefsrud, M., Orsat, V., Supplemental Lighting Orientation and Red-to-blue Ratio of Light-emitting Diodes for Greenhouse Tomato Production (2014) HortScience, 49; Hernández, R., Kubota, C., Tomato seedling growth and morphological responses to supplemental LED lighting red: Blue ratios under varied daily solar light integrals (2012) Acta Horticulturae, 956; Huché, L., Crespel, L., Gourrierecb, J., Morela, P., Light signaling and plant responses to blue and UV radiations - Perspectives for applications in horticulture (2016) Environmental and Experimental Botany, 121, pp. 22-28; Kopsell, D., Sams, C., Morrow, R., Blue Wavelengths from LED Lighting Increase Nutritionally Important Metabolites in Specialty Crops (2015) HortScience, 50","Atmadja, W.; Computer Engineering Department, Jl.

Unfortunately, the continuous flow of medical images in hospitals drives radiologists to prioritize quantity over quality. This work condition allows misinterpretation especially on ambiguous anatomical structures that resemble lung nodule for example enlarged lymph nodes and resulting in decreasing sensitivity and accuracy of malignant lung nodule detections and late diagnosis proven to be fatal to patients. To address the problem, this paper proposed a novel lung nodule detection and classification model using one stage detector called as “I3DR-Net.” The model was formed by combining pre-trained natural images weight of Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D) backbone with feature pyramid network to multi-scale 3D Thorax Computed tomography scan (CT-scan) dataset. I3DR-Net able to produce remarkable results on lung nodule texture detection task with mAP 49.61% and 22.86%, and area under curve (AUC) 81.84% and 70.36% for public and private dataset. Additionally, I3DR-Net successfully outperform previous state-of-the-art Retina U-Net and U-FRCNN + mean average precision (mAP) by 7.9% and 7.2% (57.71% VS 49.8% VS 50.5%) for malignant nodule detection and classification task. © 2020 The Authors","Computed tomography; Lung nodule; Object detection; Pattern recognition and classification; Transfer learning",,,,,"Nvidia","The experiment done in this paper was conducted using NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU granted by NVIDIA Corporation to NVIDIA ?

With the implementation of interactive learning activities regarding the introduction of the crossing signs, is expected to occur for increasing perceptual-motor skills of the research subjects. Perceptual-motor skills are associated with the ability to react quickly to any situations on the street. Through interactive learning activities, the subject research has shown their positive responses and enthusiasm in doing those activities. The research subject is ten preschool students aged 4-5. The process of data collection is conducted through observations, interviews, personal documents of the students, distributing the questionnaire to parents, as well as documentation such as photographs. The research was without IoT. The result of this research found out that the subject research's perceptual motor skills seemed to increase regarding the reaction of speed and correctness from their body movement toward the visual information given. This acquisition appears after the research subject were given some fun and hands-on activities at school especially about an introduction to the crossing signs for preschool children. It was recommended to use IoT for better achievement. © 2019 IEEE.","Interactive learning; Internet of Things; Perceptual motor skills; Road safety","Accident prevention; Artificial intelligence; Educational technology; Internet of things; Learning systems; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Surveys; Hands-on activities; Interactive learning; Perceptual motor skill; Personal documents; Preschool children; Research subjects; Road safety; Visual information; Traffic signs",,,,,,"Thomson James, A., Tolmie, A., Foot, H.C., McLaren, B., (1996) Child Development and the Aims of Road Safety Education: A Review and Analysis, , Road Safety, Research Report No. 1, Department of Transport, UK; Wortham Sue, C., (2006) Early Childhood Curriculum Developing Bases for Learning and Teaching.

Nutrient recipes and fertilizer database are stored in Raspberry PI. The system will compute the recipe and translate to the required individual concentrates' volume, then send command to dosing pump controller. Dosing pump controller will then send command to 10 dosing pump motor drivers to pump each fertilizer concentrate according to the volume measurement to produce the nutrient solution. The core of dosing pump controller is a 32bit microcontroller development board Nucleo-F446RE from ST Microelectronic, ample to control 10 dosing pump drivers. Each of the dosing pumps will be equipped with fertilizer concentration with maximum solubility. The system has user friendly graphical user interface using 7"" graphics LCD. To produce specific solution strength, system can fill in water through water pump and use water level sensor to measure the volume, this process is controlled by proportional controller. The output of the mixing process can be hydroponic A and B mixed concentrate solution, or direct solution. For concentrate solution user must dilute A and B concentrate with water. The system has been tested 9 times and produce maximum 9% error. Water filling system accuracy test for 5-liter water volume with Kp 10000 has 2.784% error. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Software size is used to estimate schedule, effort, cost and other resource in software development process. Therefore, the best method to measure software size is to derive software attributes from requirement artifacts to get early estimation. UML sequence diagram chose as source to extract software function, since this diagram provide high level granularity of function. Functional size is measured by using COSMIC method, while structural size is calculated based on control structure on sequence diagram. To automate the measurement process, XML structure of sequence diagram is analyzed to fit existing functional and structural equation. A well-known case study of rice cooker is used to depict the proposed method in this research. In addition, a simple support tool is provided. © 2017 IEEE.","COSMIC; functional size; sequence point; software size measurement; structural size; UML sequence diagram","Artificial intelligence; Cosmology; XML; COSMIC; Functional size; sequence point; Software size; Structural size; UML sequence diagrams; Software design",,,,,,"Sellami, A., Hakim, H., Abran, A., Ben-Abdallah, H., A measurement method for sizing the structure of UML sequence diagrams (2015) Inf.

Hydroponics has become a reality for greenhouse growers in virtually all climates. Large hydroponic installations exist throughout the world for growing flowers, vegetables and some short period fruit like tomato and cucumber. In soilless culture, we must maintain stable pH and conductivity level of nutrient solution to make plant grow well, large variation of pH of certain time will poisoned plant. This paper describes development complete automation hydroponic system, from maintaining stable nutrient composition (conductivity and pH), grow light, and monitor plant environment such as CO2, temperature and humidity. The heart of our automation is ARM Cortex-M4 from ST Microelectronic running ARM mbed OS, the official Real Time Operating System (RTOS) for ARM Cortex-M microcontroller. Using RTOS gives us flexibility to have multithreaded process. Results show that system capable to control desired concentration level with variation of less than 3%, pH sensor show good accuracy 5.83% from pH value 3.23-10. Growing light intensity measurement show result 105 μmol/m2/s therefore we need turn on the light at least 17 hours/day to fulfil plant light requirement. RTOS give good performance with latency and jitter less than 15 us, system overall show good performance and accuracy for automating hydroponic plant in vegetative phase of growth. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","ARM Cortex-M; growing light; Hydroponic; mbed OS; nutrient solution; RTOS","Computer operating systems; Microcontrollers; Microelectronics; Nutrients; pH; pH sensors; Arm cortices; Hydroponic; Light-intensity measurement; Nutrient solution; Nutrient-rich solutions; Real time operating system; RTOS; Temperature and humidities; ARM processors",,,,,,"Ahmad, R., Ahad, K., Iqbal, R., Muhammad, A., Acute Poisoning Due to Commercial Pesticides in Multan (2002) Pakistan Journal of Medcal Sciences, 18, pp. 227-231; Roberto, K., (2003) How-To Hydroponic, , 4 (Futuregarden); Sahare, V., Jain, P., Automated Hydroponic System using Psoc4 Prottyping Kit to Deliver Nutrients Solution Directly to Roots of Plants on Time Basis (2015) International Journal of Advanced Research in Electrical, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, 4, pp. 8765-8770; Mishra, R.I., Jain, P., Design and Implementation of Automatic Hydroponics System using ARM Processor (2015) International Journal of Advanced Research in Electrical, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, 4 (8), pp. 6935-6940; Umamaheswari, S., Preethi, A., Pravin, E., Dhanusha, R., Integrating Scheduled Hydroponic System IEEE International Conference on Advances in Computer Applications (ICACA), , (Coimbatore, India, 2016); Torres, A., Lopez, R.F., (2012) Measuring Daily Light Integral in A Greenhouse, , (Purdue); Olle, M., Viršile, A., The effect of light-emitting diode lighting on greenhouse plant growth and quality (2013) Agricultural and Food Science, 22, pp. 223-234; Massa, G.D., Kim, H.-H., Wheeler, R.M., Mitchell, C.A., Plant Productivity in Response to LED Ligthing (2008) HortScience, 43, pp. 1951-1956; Philips, (2014) Philips Ligth Recipes in Horticulture, , (Philips); (2017) Open Agriculture Initative (OpenAg), , https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/open-agriculture-openag/overview/, MIT Media Lab, [Online]; Li, Q., Yao, C., (2003) Real-Time Concepts for Embedded Systems, , R.-T.

The research focuses on conception, design, implementation and evaluation of the learning object management hypermedia API. The hypermedia API was designed based on learning object models, hypermedia concepts, and related studies. Learning object model can be represented and manipulated as a hypermedia resource. It contains page resources with text and links to multimedia elements. The hypermedia API was designed using UML and represented in HTML5 because of its rich affordance. The implementation and evaluation phase were conducted by testing the API using three different client's software to prove the concept of hypermedia as the engine of application state for managing learning objects. The results show that the hypermedia API for learning object management is accessible, consistent, and discoverable by heterogonous client applications. © 2018 The Authors.

Many organizations has implemented a computer-based service at their business process. IT Infrastructure is used to support the computerized business process that means its need to be managed as services. Therefore, for giving more value for the IT Services, organization need to apply an IT Services Management (ITSM). In Indonesia, a lot of organization has implemented a framework that can manage the IT Infrastructure, namely IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL). This framework is a best practice for ITSM that mean ITIL is not a standard of ITSM but a best, good and common practice that was successfully implemented at a large number of the organization. Through this paper, the authors want to explain how the implementation of ITIL Framework in Indonesia and identify the impact of implementation of ITIL Framework at the organization that has implemented this framework in Indonesia. © 2017 IEEE.","IT Services; ITIL; ITSM","Business Process; Computer based services; Information technology infrastructure library (ITIL); It infrastructure libraries; IT infrastructures; IT services; ITIL; ITSM; Management science",,,,,,"Brewster, E., Griffiths, R., Lawes, A., Sansbury, J., (2012) IT Service Management A Guide for ITIL Foundation Exam Candidates, , Swindon: BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT; Cartlidge, A., Rudd, C., Smith, M., Wigzel, P., Rance, S., Shaw, S., Wright, T., (2012) An Introductory Overview of ITIL, , London: Stationery Office; Prasetyo, A.A., (2016) Penerapan Service Request Management Dengan Pendekatan ITIL v3 Pada PT, , Gudang Garam Tbk.

One problem, for the police and the owner is how to track a stolen motor vehicle. Consequently, a system was built to provide a solution by creating a web-based application and using Global System for Mobile (GSM)-based communication with a Global Positioning System (GPS) module and an accelerometer sensor as a vehicle tracker. The embedded system hidden in the motor vehicle also aims to detect any hard impact from a collision or fall; it then sends the GPS coordinates to individuals who need to be contacted in case of an emergency. The web-based system collects the GPS coordinates of the motor vehicle on a periodic basis to allow tracking to determine the location of the vehicle if stolen. Setup, activation, and tracking of a motor vehicle can be performed by vehicle owners using an Android-based mobile phone. This study reviews the literature and laboratory studies to determine the system settings that will be connected to the internet as an implementation of the Internet of Things. The results are expected to help owners locate their vehicles and provide assistance requests when accidents occur.","Embedded systems; GPS; Internet of things; Motor vehicle tracker",,,,,,,"Beman, S., Falentino, S., Liawatimena, S., Perancangan Sistem Keamanan Sepeda Motor Dengan Sistem Sidik Jari.

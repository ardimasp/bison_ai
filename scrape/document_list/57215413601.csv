Likewise with a service system, the hospital should try to provide the best service facilities. This research presents a framework of gamification that is applied to the game elements integration. With this gamified system patients are expected to be able to play games while waiting for their examination turn without feeling boring. Another expectation of using the gamified system is to see the loyalty of patients who frequently visit the hospital. This includes architecture for gamified systems and guidelines to assist in the gamified activities development. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

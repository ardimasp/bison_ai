The split incentive problem identified in Indonesia shows that the currently designed program of incentives is still problematic for both providers and customers. This suggests that there are multiple alternatives to the incentives that are more suitable to assist in energy-efficiency implementation. Using case studies on retrofit financing for LED lamps in Indonesia, this study aimed to test the validity of those issues, which involved the process of energy decision-making within an organization. Triangulating the findings from case studies and questionnaire surveys, recommendations for future researchers, practitioners, and the government were made. The results indicated that retrofit financing in Indonesia is feasible. Financial metrics such as the analysis of discounted payback period, IRR, and NPV were used to further validate the result. The study also identified that the provider can use Game Theory as a tool to analyze the costs and benefits of retrofit business decisions to tackle the split incentive problems. These findings could lead to improvement in strategies in considering the effectiveness of a firm’s policy measures for delivering energy efficiency in the future. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","ESA & ESPC; Game theory; LCC; Retrofit; Split incentive problem",,,,,,"Allcott, H., Greenstone, M., Is there an energy efficiency gap?

This study compiles and analyzes business models and financing options for retrofitting financing of BEE in Indonesia: estab-lishing a framework for a critical comparative study, compare and assess the BEE government measures availability, and survey the cus-tomers' expectation of BEE measures. This study looks at the favorable measures that the Indonesian Government could take, and trian-gulate the findings of the comparative study and questionnaire survey to develop recommendations for BEE measures in Indonesia. It was found that the lack of economic incentives, diverse business models, and limited financing options might be the most prominent problems of the BEE promotion at the current stage in Indonesia. Un-consolidated policy among legislations is hampering the efforts of any BEE promotion. Tax incentives are likely to be more viable and efficient option for most of the Indonesian company, as well as ac-tive government interventions to promote BEE development. Illustrating the findings and regulatory analyses, as well as in-depth inter-views with business representatives, this study identified several types of business models and some favorable financing option. © 2018 Authors.","Building energy efficiency; Government measures; Retrofitting",,,,,,"(2011) 'South East Asia Energy Efficiency Market Report 2011.'; Oberman, R., Dobbs, R., Budiman, A., Thompson, F., Rosse, M., (2012) 'The archipelago economy: Unleashing Indonesia's potential, ', pp. 7-65. , no.

The operational lease is a major source and is important for off-balance sheet financing in Indonesia. Therefore, the implementation of IFRS-16 will probably hurt Indonesian business. The contract and/or service level agreements on the retrofits for the energy efficiency product can relieve the business owner from cash flow and new debts. This study established a framework for a critical comparative study; compare and assess the possibility of the retrofit financial practices under the current taxes regime, and the possibility upon IFRS-16 implementation to better understand the favorable measures for retrofit practitioners and future customers to handle the disputes. Triangulate the findings of comparative study and questionnaire survey to develop recommendation for the future researchers, practitioners and the government. The result indicates that the benefits of the retrofits financing implementation beat the cost and complexity posed by the enactment of new IFRS standards. Thus, the impact of the IFRS-16 and taxation are being considered as a part of business constraints that should be addressed together and able to manage the disputes over misperception on retrofits aspects with taxes officers. © 2018 Authors.","IFRS; Retrofits; Tax implications",,,,,,"Qian, Q.K., Chan, E.H.W., Government measures needed to promote building energy efficiency (BEE) in China (2010) Facilities, 28 (11-12), pp. 564-589; Dunleavy, P., Margetts, H., Bastow, S., Tinkler, J., New Public Management Is Dead-Long Live Digital-Era Governance (2005) Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 16, pp. 467-494; Kielstra, D.P., (2011) Talent Managemrnt-A Strategic Actor. 2016, pp. 4-7. , ACCA.

The absorptive capacity variables utilize the new external information and new knowledge in relation to the company innovativeness into the new product, new services, new processes, and new systems for internationalization achievement. This study investigates several factors that affect the service innovation capability based on samples of 38 Indonesian SMEs. We presume that our samples previously have a potential absorptive capacity as a basis to enhance their innovation capabilities and company's performance. We test the hypotheses on several samples of Indonesian SMEs, using multivariate OLS regression analysis and Multi Discriminant Analysis. The results indicate that the combined factors of ""number sales & marketing"", ""product launching"" and the ""customer involvement"" have a significant effect on ""internationalization"" in as a representation of service innovation capability. By keeping these ""science-push"" and ""demand-pull"" of SMEs on innovation as a top priority, the innovation opportunity will be alive and better practice under AEC implementation. © 2018 Authors.","Indonesian SMEs; Internationalization; Service Innovation",,,,,,"Sudarmaji, E., Employing Open Innovation Where SMEs Need It Most: The Indonesian Perspective (2016) In: 4th Gadjah Mada International Conference on Econimics And Business 2016, pp. 696-709; Wynarczyk, P., Open innovation in SMEs (2013) J Small Bus Enterp Dev, 20 (2), pp. 258-278; van de Vrande, V., de Jong, J.P.J., Vanhaverbeke, W., de Rochemont, M., Open innovation in SMEs: Trends, motives and management challenges (2009) Technovation, 29 (6-7), pp. 423-437; Hamdani, J., Wirawan, C., Open Innovation Implementation to Sustain Indonesian SMEs (2012) Procedia Econ Financ, 4, pp. 223-233. , Icsmed; Dong, L.J., Park, C., Research and development linkages in a national innovation system: Factors affecting success and failure in Korea (2006) Technovation, 26 (9), pp. 1045-1054; Lee, S., Park, G., Yoon, B., Park, J., Open innovation in SMEs-An intermediated network model (2010) Res Policy, 39 (2), pp. 290-300; Christensen, C.M., (2005) The Innovator's Dilemma-When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail, , Harvard Business School Press; Sarosa, S., Adoption of Social Media Networks by Indonesian SME: A Case Study (2012) Procedia Econ Financ, 4, pp. 244-254; Cohen, W., Levinthal, D., Absorptive Capacity: A New Perspective on Learning and Innovation Wesley M (1990) Cohen ; Daniel A .

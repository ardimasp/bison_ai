PT Surya Toto Indonesia Tbk has an overall supply chain performance score of 71,5738 out of 100 which is included in ""good"" category. The weakest point in the supply chain are the upside supply chain adaptability. Analyzing it further, it is known that the cause of the problem is the ordering system of raw materials in the company. Improvements are made in the design of new raw material ordering system using forecasting method and MRP lot-sizing. Using MRP lot-sizing Period Order Quantity (POQ) and Part Period Balancing (PPB) for three types of raw materials obtained supply chain performance score improvement to 73,6350, which led to cost reduction of 54,6696%, 49,3365%, and 45,4588% subsequently for raw material A, B, and C. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

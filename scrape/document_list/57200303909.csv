The frequency of published news is an indicator of the various levels of a problem. The more attention paid by a newspaper to the community, the more valuable it is in reporting problems. Currently, news related to the COVID-19 outbreak is most popular. The media has been reporting not only on health but also on social and economic issues during the pandemic. The questions of this research are (1) what social issues were reported in the online news media during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) what economic issues were reported in the online news media during the same period. This study aims to identify the content of news when conveying COVID-19 pandemic information based on the frequency of appearance and news content based on social and economic issues in online news. This is a descriptive quantitative study using a content analysis approach to obtain primary data from 6,376 online news articles published by Antara News from 28 February to 8 April 2020. The NVivo 12 tool was used to analyse the data by dividing the types of COVID-19 issues related to social and economic issues in the news (in the form of text, images, videos and graphics) as an analysis unit. The results showed that Antara News used text, photos, videos and graphics 1,847 times for social issues and 2,701 times for economic issues related to COVID-19. The social issues involved 20 themes. Some of the important ones included regulations, social funds and charities, the humanities, the availability of infrastructure facilities, education, instruction and appeal, and culture and religion. Meanwhile, the economic issues involved 52 themes. Some of the important ones included exchange rates; transportation; the oil, natural gas and electricity industries; social funds and charities; regulation and policy; agriculture; and the tourism industry. The topics are related to social distancing, social restrictions, social actions, culture, other problems associated with the social sector (a decline in community purchasing power, consumption and dismissal) and the real and massive impact on economic growth. COVID-19 is not only a global health crisis but also a major labour market and economic crisis that has had a significant impact on society. In conclusion, a broader study is recommended using several publication periods and online media. © 2020 The Author(s)Social science; Economic impact; Exchange rate; Social impact; Regulation © 2020 The Author(s)","Economic impact; Exchange rate; Regulation; Social impact; Social science",,,,,"Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan

Indonesia is known for its generosity, as seen from the caring, responsible and attentive attitude of all parties in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to ease the burden on society. All community elements were involved in social actions, such as the provision of rapid testing kits by the East Kalimantan provincial government, the distribution of rice boxes for online drivers by the presidential secretariat, and the huge production of masks by people with disabilities and West Kalimantan tailors. Furthermore, assistance was provided by the Batang Regency Government, the Ministry of Manpower, the police and Dompet Dhuafa. Free payment tuition fees for public high school students in the Riau Islands for three months. In addition, the Gajah Mada University (UGM) Tzu Chi Foundation and UGM Disaster Response Unit (DERU) provided masks for doctors, 400 tons of basic food for the community in Bandar Lampung and freehand sanitisers to Pangkal Pinang and Central Kalimantan communities. There was also Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) assistance for volunteers and hospitals from the Ministry of Education and Culture, the Ministry of Social Affairs, Pawnshop, the IKA Undip-Djarum Foundation, the Jambi city government, the Tanoto Foundation and accessories companies in Riau. Approximately 50,000 L of disinfectants were distributed by the Hasanuddin Military District Command and Laskar Sasak, with Polimerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tools from the State-owned Enterprises (SOE) Ministry.","Akmaluddin, Analisis Isi Informasi Pembangunan Perikanan Dan Kelautan Pada Surat Kabar Kompas Dan Republika (2004), Institut Pertanian Bogor; Jumlah Terkonfirmasi, Dirawat, Meninggal Dan Sembuh Covid19 (2020); Biagi, S., Media/Impact: Pengantar Media Massa (2010), ninth ed.

Informativeness plays a key role in online shopping decisions. Potential customers usually collect useful information and do a comparison before considering the purchase. Electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) is considered a reliable source of information. Customer reviews and influencer reviews can be considered eWOM. They represent customers’ sharing of experience and evaluation of a product or service with other potential shoppers. There is abundant evidence concerning the influence of eWOM on purchase intention. However, there are few studies on influencer reviews and purchase intention. This study aims to investigate the impact of customer review and influencer review to purchase intention and the mediating role of trust to those relationship. A quantitative experimental study (2 × 1) was conducted. Two hundred respondents from three cities in Greater Jakarta were divided into two groups to self-rate their opinion on customer review, influencer review, trust and purchase intention. Data collected was analysed PLS using SmartPLS. The study results showed that influencer review has a positive impact on purchase intention. On the other hand, customer review failed to show its influence. Trust as a moderating variable was also not validated in this study. © 2020","Business management; Customer review; Digital media; Influencer; Marketing; Purchase intention; Social media; Technology adoption; Trust",,,,,"Binus University","D.D.

Studies show that innovation is one of key factor for firms’ survival, success and sustainable competitive advantages. Leadership is reported to be one of the most important predictors of innovation. Transformational Leadership style is considered as the most suitable type of leadership which can influence innovation. However, the impact of transformational leadership to innovation is not consistent. Recognizing that innovation is a complex concept which requires to both explore and exploit in a non-linear sequence, therefore it is not enough for leader to have only one specific leadership style. Ambidextrous leadership style, which has both opening and closing leadership behaviours, is considered to be more effective in the work of innovation. This study aims to provide further empirical evidence of the link between ambidextrous leadership style with team creativity and innovation as well as relationship between team creativity and team innovation and how team innovation influences team performance. Quantitative descriptive study was conducted to 144 senior staff and managers from various industry in several cities in Indonesia. Structured questionnaire was designed for respondent to rate their leaders leadership style, team creativity, team innovation and team performance. Data was analysed was using SEM-AMOS. The result of the study showed that there were positive links between ambidextrous leadership to team creativity and to team innovation. Positive relationship was also confirmed between team creativity and team innovation. This study also confirm the influence of team innovation to team performance. This study contribute to ambidextrous leadership theory as well as leadership to innovation literature, especially in Indonesia context.

The influence of information technology (IT) also has impacted the way firms do business, not only improving process efficiency, but also data analyses, decision-making, customer acquisition and retention which lead to the improvement of organization sustainability. However, the implementation of new technology is not easy. Various studies have shown failure in the technology implementation. Based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the quality of the system, which consists of perceived usefulness (POU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU), has been understood to influence customer satisfaction. However, there are still few studies that link system quality and customer loyalty. This study aimed to see the influence of system quality on customer loyalty. Using a descriptive quantitative method, this study was conducted on BPJS Kesehatan (Universal Health Coverage Program in Indonesia) members at 19 public and private hospitals in nine cities in Java, Indonesia. A six-point Likert scale questionnaire was designed and distributed. Four hundred and six samples collected were eligible for analysis using descriptive analysis and structural equation modelling with LISREL. The results show there is a positive relationship between system quality and customer loyalty. This study strengthens the body of evidence which showed the influence of POU and PEOU on customer loyalty. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Customer loyalty; Perceived ease of use; Perceived of usefulness; TAM",,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., Attitude-Behavior Relations: A Theoretical Analysis and Review of Empirical Research (1977) Psychological Bulletin, 84 (5), pp. 888-918. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.84.5.888; Calisir, F., Altin Gumussoy, C., Bayraktaroglu, A.E., Karaali, D., Predicting the intention to use a web-based learning system: Perceived content quality, anxiety, perceived system quality, image, and the technology acceptance model (2014) Human Factors and Ergonomics In Manufacturing, 24 (5), pp. 515-531. , https://doi.org/10.1002/hfm.20548; Calisir, F., Gumussoy, C.A., Bayraktaroglu, A.E., Karaali, D., Predicting the Intention to Use a Web-Based Learning System: Perceived Content Quality, Anxiety, Perceived System Quality, Image, and the Technology Acceptance Model Fethi (2014) Human Factors and Ergonomics In Manufacturing & Service Industries, 24 (5), pp. 515-531. , https://doi.org/10.1002/hfm; Davis, F.D., Bagozzi, R.P., Warshaw, P.R., User Acceptance of Computer Technology: A Comparison of Two Theoretical Models (1989) Management Science, 35 (8), pp. 982-1003. , https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.35.8.982; Hsu, L.-C., Influence of Quality of Information System Success (ISS) on Customer Intention to Continue Use in B2B E-commerce: A Contingency Approach of System Anxiety (2014) Research Journal of Business Management, 8, pp. 353-366. , https://doi.org/10.3923/rjbm.2014.353.366; Kim, J., Jin, B., Swinney, J.L., The role of etail quality, e-satisfaction and e-trust in online loyalty development process development process (2009) Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 16, pp. 239-247. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretconser.2008.11.019; Kim, M., Vogt, C.A., Knutson, B.J., Relationship among Customer Sayisfaction (2015) Delight and Loyalty In the Hospitality Industry, 39 (2), pp. 170-197. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1096348012471376; Lee, D., Moon, J., Jin, Y., Yi, M.Y., Information & Management Antecedents and consequences of mobile phone usability: Linking simplicity and interactivity to satisfaction, trust, and brand loyalty (2015) Information & Management, 52 (3), pp. 295-304. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.im.2014.12.001; Liaw, S.S., Investigating students' perceived satisfaction, behavioral intention, and effectiveness of e-learning: A case study of the Blackboard system (2008) Computers and Education, 51 (2), pp. 864-873. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2007.09.005; Lovelock, C., Wirtz, J., Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy (2011) Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy, , https://doi.org/10.1044/1059-0889(2011/10-0028; Navimipour, N.J., Soltani, Z., (2016) The Impact of Cost, Technoloy Acceptance and Employees' Satisfaction On the Effectiveness of the Electronic Customer Relationship Management System, 55. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2015.10.036; Oliver, R.L., (2015) Satisfaction a Behavioral Perspective On Consumer, , 2nd ed.).

In many countries, the recommendation of health authorities forced the education sector to find an alternative of face-to-face session method. The distance learning method may be the best option for students in a forced situation. Even though e-learning is a hot topic, e-learning is still more of a supplement to education in normal conditions. This study wants to see the factors influencing e-learning satisfaction and performance to respondents who are forced to join e-learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive quantitative study using a structured questionnaire as the instrument was conducted to University Students at 4 campuses in Greater Jakarta, Indonesia. They were asked to self-rate the goal orientation, perceived ease of use, service quality, information quality, e-learning satisfaction, and perceived performance. One hundred fifty-three questionnaires were analyzed with SEM LISREL. The finding of the study shows that perceived ease of use (PEOU) and service quality have significant positive impacts on e-learning satisfaction, but not goal orientation and information quality. E-learning satisfaction positively influences to perceived performance. This study contributes to D&M IS Success Model and e-learning body of evidence.

Customers’ decision on online purchase still is influenced by how confident they are in making purchase decision. Influencer endorsement is a hot concept in marketing; however, scholars argue there is only little evident on how influencer endorsement can improve performance. On the other hand, customer reviews are considered as effective in influencing customers’ decision. Where customers buy is also an interesting topic. Studies on B2C e-marketplace are still limited. This study aims to see young customers’ perception about influencer endorsement, customer review and e-tailing channel. A qualitative study was conducted to 55 respondents from Jakarta and Bogor. To further understand their opinions, interview was conducted to 10 of respondents. The finding of the study are young customers believe in customer review rather than influencer endorsement. They prefer to shop in e-marketplace compared to company owned website.

Firms introduced as approach to combine act of giving & business purpose so that customers view purchasing as a prosocial behavior. Currently there is still limited measures available to assess generosity construct, especially in Indonesia. Two quantitative studies to review the validity and reliability of two type generosity measures were conducted, pilot study which involves 42 samples and extension study which involves 200 samples. Structured questionnaires which distributed online was used as instrutment of the studies. The result of data analysis with SPSS shows that Buhrow’s Generosity scale is valid but not reliable in both pilot and extension studies. However, IG Scale from Smith and Hill is reliable and valid. Reviewing the items of both scales reveals that some items in Buhrow’s scale were not common term and common practice in Indonesia. Therefore, culture fit context should be an important consideration in choosing generosity scale.

The sudden increase in demand will disrupt the delivery of service, especially in public hospitals, which will influence service satisfaction levels. A preliminary study shows that satisfaction levels of BPJS Kesehatan patients are still low. The most frequent reasons cited for dissatisfaction are fairness issues such as different treatments and different processes and procedures. Studies have found that aside from evaluations of quality, fairness is indeed an important factor that influences satisfaction. Yet there are limited empirical researches on the effect of service fairness on service delivery, especially in the healthcare industry. This study addresses the question of whether there are direct relationships between three variables of fairness and customer satisfaction. In other words, are there different levels of perceived service fairness in private and public hospitals and, if so, does this have an impact on customer satisfaction? Using a descriptive quantitative method, this study was conducted on BPJS Kesehatan members who used 19 public and private hospitals in nine cities in Java, Indonesia. A six-point Likert scale questionnaire was designed and distributed. Four hundred and six samples collected were eligible for analysis using descriptive analysis and structural equation modelling using LISREL. The results show that there is a positive impact of the three variables regarding service fairness on customer satisfaction in public and private hospitals. However, the relationship between distributive fairness and customer satisfaction is not significant in public hospitals. This study strengthens the building evidence that service fairness, in addition to service quality, influences customer satisfaction, specifically in service delivery in the healthcare industry. © BEIESP.","BPJS Kesehatan; Private Hospitals; Public Hospitals; Satisfaction",,,,,,,"Bredenkamp, C., Evans, T., Lagrada, L., Langenbrunner, J., Nachuk, S., Palu, T., Emerging challenges in implementing universal health coverage in Asia (2015) Soc Sci Med, 145, pp. 243-248; Thabrany, H., Raja Grafindo Persada (2016) Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional, 3, pp. 1-295; Dwidienawati, D., Abdinagoro, S.B., Does Generosity Influence Intention to Continue Paying Insurance Premium?

The rapid expansion of health insurance coverage has created demand which cannot be met by current healthcare system and will disrupt the delivery service (Bredenkamp et al., 2015). The disruption of service, as a consequence, will influence the satisfaction. Patient satisfaction evaluation is important because it is not only as an important indicator to evaluate the achievement of the program but also it is important to improve treatment outcome. At present there is limited report on patients’ satisfaction to BPJS Kesehatan provider. This study is aiming to find out the satisfaction level of BPJS Kesehatan in Indonesia after 3 years of program implementation. This study using questionnaires as survey instruments. Aiming to BPJS Kesehatan midair that pays monthly payment insurance in six hospitals in five big cities in Indonesia. Three hundred and twenty-eight questionnaires are eligible to be analyzed. Decsriptive analyzed is done to evaluate the satisfaction rate. The result of the study shows that patients are satisfy with the interaction, support and services provided by BPJS Kesehatan patients, which is ninety-four per cent satisfaction. This study result is different with the pervious study which shows lower satisfaction rate. The explanation is that in this study majority of respondents come from private hospitals which known to have better service compares to public hospitals. To confirm the result of the study, further study which involved more balance public and private hospitals and big cities and small cities should be done to compare the satisfaction rate from each type of hospitals and cities.

Now, along comes Generation Z (Gen Z). What difference can a decade make? Different social and economic conditions shaped different generations with different values, behaviours, and attitudes. A study in the USA confirms that Gen Z is more realistic and self-reliant. Global events and developments will impact different countries at different rates and intensities. Therefore, generational characteristics may be cultural- and country- specific. This study aimed to see the characteristics of Gen Z in Indonesia. A descriptive quantitative study was conducted at one prominent private university in Jakarta, Indonesia. Eighty-nine survey respondents answered a questionnaire with a voting pad. The finding of the study confirms that unlike Gen Y, Gen Z in Indonesia also considers job security and money important. Unlike Gen Y, they are willing to work harder for higher pay and relocate to other cities and countries for decent job opportunities. They also consider face to face communication important. Due to small size samples, a bigger sample size is recommended for the generalization of Gen Z characteristics in Indonesia. The theoretical contribution of this study is adding empirical evidence of Gen Z characteristics. Practically, this study will give insight to management that Gen Z is different than Gen Y; therefore, they need different treatment. © 2018 Authors.","Characteristic of generation; Generation Z; Indonesia",,,,,,,"Annis, J., (2017) Annis: Gen Z willing to trade hard work for job security; Bassiouni, D.H., Hackley, C., ""Generation Z"" children's adaptation to digital consumer culture: A critical literature review (2014) Journal of Customer Behaviour, 13 (2), pp. 113-133. , https://doi.org/10.1362/147539214X14024779483591; Berkup, S.B., Working with Generations X and Y in Gen-eration Z Period: Management of Different Generations in Business Life (2014) Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences, 5 (19), pp. 218-229. , https://doi.org/10.5901/mjss.2014.v5n19p218; Culpin, V., Millar, C.C.J.M., Peters, K., Multigenera-tional frames of reference: managerial challenges of four social generations in the organisation (2015) Journal of Managerial Psychology, 30 (1), pp. 6-10. , https://doi.org/10.1108/JMP-08-2014-0231; Fountain, J., Lamb, C., Generation Y as young wine con-sumers in New Zealand: how do they differ from Generation X?

The most mentioned reason for continued membership is helping others. Therefore, the preliminary study concludes that there might be a role of generosity influencing intention. This study aims to develop a conceptual model linking generosity to intention. The method used for critical review is PRISMA systematic review. The result of the critical review is used as the based for concept development. More than three hundred publications published after 2007 in Science Direct were screened with key words ""generosity"" and ""charity"". Finally, thirty journals were included in this review. The finding is that the most discussed topics are terminology (3 journals), motivation (16 journals), consequences (5 journals), and attributes of generosity (5 journals). Based on the review results, two possible relationships between generosity and intention are proposed. The first is that generosity, mediated by positive emotion, will influence intention. The second is that generosity has a direct influence on intention. It concludes with the need for further study to find empirical validation of the two possible relationships between generosity and intention. This is the first study proposed to link the generosity to intention.","BPJS Kesehatan; Generosity; Intention; Positive Emotion",,,,,,,"Aknin, L.B., Dunn, E.W., Whillans, A.V., Grant, A.M., Norton, M.I., 'Making a difference matters: Impact unlocks the emotional benefits of prosocial spending' (2013) Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization.

Security and privacy in cloud computing are major concern for companies. Therefore, cloud computing architecture strategy and design are needed to reduce costs and ensure the security of company assets in cloud computing. In this study, we are using multi-layered security strategy that contain of Next-Generation Firewall and Web Application Firewall technologies. We conducted an evaluation on the design by using the SQL injection and malicious file injection method. The results of the evaluation show that the cloud computing architecture design that we proposed manage to prevent SQL injection and malicious file injection threats. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

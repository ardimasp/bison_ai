Organizations must define resources and capabilities to help choose and implement the right strategies. By fostering learning can make a difference in navigating the unknown of VUCA. Learning center becomes one of the important functions in improving the ability of employees to help organization gain the competitive advantage. Corporate Universities are increasingly emerging to answer this challenging situation, but whether the established corporate university can provide value for the organization?. This research conducted a case study on Binus Corporate Learning & Development (BCL&D) as a corporate university since 2013. It is found that corporate universities are important to conduct this survey, in order to know the gaps that exist between the programs offered and what is assessed by employees, and how corporate university communicate the value given. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

Research stages are done through literature based on End-User Computing Satisfaction (EUCS) satisfaction factor which consists of content, accuracy, timeless, ease of use and format. Questionnaires were developed based on each factor of EUCS and distributed to the user ie the students. Based on the formula Izaac and Michael the results of the sample calculation there are 380 students who become sample. Based on data from questionnaires that have been distributed validation test and reliability of 20 data responder first before further processing. The result of the questionnaire that has been collected is analyzed to the gap between expectation and reality to get user satisfaction on the use of LMS. After obtaining user satisfaction, it is done by Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach to determine what factors influence student's satisfaction by the factor on EUCS. The results show that users are not satisfied with all factors, and factor accuracy is the most important factor in determining user satisfaction, while the most important experience factor is timelines. The results of the open questionnaire, the user provides input for improvements to LMS related to access speed and feature addition and development of mobile-based LMS. © 2018 IEEE.","AHP; analytical hierachy process; end-user computing satisfaction; EUC; learning management systems; LMS","Hierarchical systems; Information management; Students; Surveys; Web browsers; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Ease-of-use; End user computing; Learning management system; Research stages; Student's satisfaction; User satisfaction; Validation test; Human computer interaction",,,,,"Watson, W.R., Watson, S.L., An argument for clarity: What are learning management systems, what are they not, and what should they become?

An evaluation of blended learning implementation in a university is performed by measuring the satisfaction level of the students in the face-to-face sessions, the independent learning session using online learning, and the overall learning experience with the blended learning environment. Several components have been measured: the content of the online learning, the features, and ease of use of the learning management platform, as well as the interactivity between the students and the lecturer and among the students.

The situation keeps changing, depending on the economy and information technology as the backbone of business processes in organizations. Higher education institutions should have added values to win the competition. Furthermore, the awareness of the society about the importance of formal education, particularly higher education, will make colleges/universities strategic institutions generating high quality human resources. The success of colleges/universities is determined by service quality, which can be identified through the satisfaction of their customers, students and lecturers. To increase customer satisfaction and be able to compete in the globalization era, as well as generate greater profits, colleges/universities need to identify factors which influence information system services to increase customer satisfaction.

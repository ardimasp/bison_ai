Eighty five fifth-grade students were assigned to experimental and control groups. A pre-test was administered to assess figural creativity factors consisting of receptive fluency, flexibility, originality and elaboration. After eight weeks of Logo programming learning, the experimental group had significantly higher scores compared to the control group on all figural creativity factors. These results revealed significant differences in creativity, especially in flexibility and originality factors. Thus, it is suggestive that Logo programming may provide opportunities for improving student creativity. © 2014 Science Publication.","Creativity; Logo Programming; Turtle Geometry",,,,,,"Clements, D.H., Nastasi, B.K., Computers and Early Childhood Education (1992) Advances in School Psychology: Preschool and Early Childhood Treatment Directions, pp. 187-246. , In: Gettinger, M., S.N.

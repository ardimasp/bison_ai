GIS Bookstore is one company that needs data every month to be analyzed. However, GIS Bookstore has constraints in processing large data with increasing time. for example GIS bookstore has problems in analyzing bestsellers because of the increasing number of authors and book publishers who work together. In this study, GIS Bookstore found a solution by implementing business intelligence that plays a role in the processing of raw data in large amounts of data into well-structured data information, the results are collected and processed in a data warehouse scheme. Targets stored in the data warehouse are data that will be processed based on the model design method (ERD) and star schema. This paper discusses the GIS Bookstore data warehouse with the aim of analyzing the sales of most books based on a certain time period. The method used in retrieving data uses Pentaho data integration tools, MySQL workbench, report designer, bi server and workbench schema. © 2019 IEEE.","architecture; business intelligence; data warehouse; design","Architecture; Competitive intelligence; Data warehouses; Design; Information analysis; Integration tools; Large amounts of data; Large data; Model design; Star schema; Structured data; Surrounding environment; Time-periods; Data integration",,,,,"Asrani, D., Jain, R., Designing a framework to standardize data warehouse development process for effective data warehousing practices (2016) International Journal of Database Management Systems, 8 (4), pp. 15-32. , http://doi.org/10.5121/ijdms.2016.8402; North, M., Thomas, L., Richardson, R., Akpess, P., Data warehousing a practical managerial approach (2017) Computer Science and Information Technology, 5 (1), pp. 18-26. , http://doi.org/10.13189/csit.2017.050103; Wang, J., Kourik, J.L., Data warehouse snowflake design and performance considerations in business analytics (2015) Journal of Advances in Information Technology, 6 (4), pp. 212-216. , http://doi.org/10.12720/jait.6.4.212-216; White, M., (2018) Big Data Vs.

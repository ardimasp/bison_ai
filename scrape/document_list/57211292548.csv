This action needs a lot of effort and lack of flexibility. This study focuses on using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to carry out their online daily business with one another. Despite of using API-Method, the paper presents an integrated information or data that reduces redundancy process. This study is to proposed system architecture which create new solution based on SOA and ESB as the main middleware through internet. It called the SOA integration for e-marketplace. It will integrated all used E-Commerce domains to one platform to manage as Single Source The objective is for interconnecting between different domains and make it become interoperability and manageability. The impact of the interoperability, it could be possible to seller to manage product listing and order management from all domains, and gain customer's satisfaction growth and also fulfil the flexibility demand from SMEs and customers. © 2019 IEEE.","E-Commerce; Marketplace; Marketplace Platform; Service Oriented Architecture (SOA); Single Source E-Commerce System","Computer architecture; Customer satisfaction; Electronic commerce; Information services; Interoperability; Middleware; Business expansion; E-commerce systems; Integrated informations; Marketplace; Marketplace Platform; Redundancy process; Small and medium enterprise; System architectures; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,"Aulkemeier, F., Schramm, M., Iacob, M., Van Hillegersberg, J., (2016) A service-oriented e-commerce reference architecture; Triandini, E., Djunaidy, A., Siahaan, D., (2017) A Maturity Model for E-Commerce Adoption by Small and Medium Enterprise in Indonesia; Abdulazim Mohamed, U., Galal-Edeen Galal, H., El-Zoghbi, Adel, A., (2010) Building An Integrated B2B E-Commerce Hub Architecture Based on SOA and Semantic Ontology; Baraka, R., Alashqar, Y., (2013) Building A SOA-Based Model for Purchase Order Management in E-Commerce Systems; Chiang, C., (2014) Software Development Concerns in the Building of Service-Oriented Based Enterprise Systems; Schmidt, M., Hutchison, B., Lambros, P., Phippen, R., The enterprise service bus: Making service-oriented architecture real (2005) IBM Systems Journal, 44 (4), pp. 781-797; Baraka, R., Alashwar, Y., (2013) Building A SOA-Based Model for Purchase Order Management in E-Commerce Systems; Ezenwoke, A., Misra, S., Adigun, M., (2013) An Approach for E-Commerce On-Demand Service-oriented Product Line Development",,"Slamin S.Prihandoko A.C.Adnan F.Prasetyo B.Nerisafitra P.Riskiawan H.Y.Sulistiyani E.Destarianto P.","IEEE Signal Processing Society Indonesia Chapter","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2019 International Conference on Computer Science, Information Technology, and Electrical Engineering, ICOMITEE 2019","16 October 2019 through 17 October 2019",,155867,,9781728134369,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Continuous transaction is a state where users make transactions repeatedly and continuously. Using four independent constructs which have relation to trust and satisfaction. By using a simple random sampling technique and evaluate the analysis using structural equation model, has discovers that continuous transactions are influenced by the satisfaction of users of M-banking application. The ease of use and usefulness felt by users also have an impact on the level of satisfaction. The results of this study indicate that to improve user satisfaction it is necessary to make improvements in other aspects, such as convenience on using M-banking application, benefits obtained, level of application security, and maintain user privacy. It is hoped that this research can provide a new perspective on the continuous transactions of M-banking application users. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

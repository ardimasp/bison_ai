The data used is the data of student learning transactions in 2016 and 2017 as many as 16000. There are 4 assessment indicators of distance learning student learning outcomes, namely Forum discussion (FOD), Personal assignment (PAS), TAS and Quiz (QIZ). The technique is then discussed in terms of prediction accuracy, using machine learning with the Naïve Bayes algorithm with the Rapid Miner application. The results state that student activity in the FOD discussion forum is the biggest indicator that influences student learning outcomes. With performance vector result accuracy of 84.03%. With an active group discussion forum with diverse backgrounds and student characteristics, most of which are workers showing activities, the discussion forum provides knowledge sharing between students and lecturers in the learning process to be both very good and important. © 2019 IEEE.","distance learning; Machine learning; Naïve bayes; online learning; recommender system","Distance education; Engineering education; Forecasting; Machine learning; Assessment indicator; Group discussions; Knowledge-sharing; Learning achievement; Performance vectors; Prediction accuracy; Student characteristics; Student learning outcomes; Students",,,,,"Kaewkiriya, T., Utakrit, N., Tiantong, M., The design of a rule base for an e-learning recommendation system base on multiple intelligences (2015) Int.

Therefore, improvement of business processes, technological reliability (technology), and readiness of human resources (people) is very important to be done continuously in order to provide a perfect educational service for all stakeholders concerned. Because of its online environment, every academic operational activities should be run smoothly so the institution could deliver a high-quality services to every stakeholders related. Some of the activity that needed to be improved in academic operational is the exam preparation and planning process. Since it's still manual, the process of it is still reluctant of human-error and very time-consuming. This study aims to implement business process management (BPM) in the exam preparation process in Operational Section of BINUS Online Learning, BPM framework will be conducted and some of tools are used in the research, such as business process model and notation, process selection matrix, and activity-based costing. Based on findings, online exam application came out as a proposed solution. Cost and time saving estimation by 85.85% and 36.04% are the result if the proposed solution will be developed and implemented. © 2018 IEEE.","activity-based-costing; business process; business process management; business process management framework; online learning business process","Administrative data processing; Computer aided instruction; Cost accounting; Costs; Enterprise resource management; Information management; Activity based costing; Business Process; Business process management; Business process model; Educational services; High quality service; Online learning environment; Operational activity; E-learning",,,,,"Drǎgan, M., Ivana, D., Arba, R., Business process modeling in higher education institutions developing a framework for Total Quality Management at Institutional Level (2014) Procedia Econ.

The method of the research is by simulating the SOHO unit with variation of shading opening angles in order to adapt to each unit. Analysis done to every shading opening angle to get the appropriate daylight intensity level which support the work activities in every unit for the whole day. In order for the shading to be able to adapt to the changing daylight condition, previously developed parametric camshaft mechanism was used. The study found that the visual comfort for SOHO with creative industries workers in Jakarta can be achieve by varying the shading opening angles between 15-75°. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,"Akmal, I., (2008) SOHO: Small Office Home Office; Tzempelikos, T., Integration of dynamic facades with other building systems (2007) Automated Buildings Magazine, , May; Ochoa, C.E., Capeluto, I.G., Strategic decision- making for intelligent buildings: Comparative impact of passive design strategies and active features in a hot climate (2008) Building and Environment, 43, pp. 1829-1839; Hansanuwat, R., (2010) Kinetic Facades As Environmental Control Systems: Using Kinetic Facades to Increase Energy Efficiency and Building Performance in Office Buildings, , Master of Building Science Thesis, University of Southern California, May; Skavara, M.E., (2009) Learning Emergence, Adaptive Cellular Automata Façade Trained by Artificial Neural Networks, , Master of Science in Adaptive Architecture & Computation Thesis, Bartlett UCL, September; Wang, J., Li, J., Bio-inspired kinetic envelope for building energy efficiency based on parametric design of building information modeling (2010) Power and Energy Engineering Conference, IEEE; Wang, J., Li, J., Chen, X., Parametric design based on building information modeling for sustainable buildings (2010) International Conference on Challenges in Environmental Science and Computer Engineering, IEEE; Sullivan, C.C., (2006) Robo Buildings.

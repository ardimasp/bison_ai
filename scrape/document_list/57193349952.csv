The method that be used in this research is by distributing questionnaires to the respondents and the data obtained were processed quantitatively with path analysis. The results showed that the leadership of the lecturer did not have significant influence, because it only accounted for 12.1%, while the effect of organizational culture on the students' SPIRIT character development is also not significant, which amounted to 6.4%. It can be concluded that the leadership and organizational culture have no significant effect on the students' SPIRIT character development. So, it is very necessary to develop leadership and organizational culture in order to give significant effect to the students' SPIRIT character building. © 2017 IEEE.","Culture organization; Leadership; SPIRIT character building","Regression analysis; Surveys; Leadership; Long-term goals; Organizational cultures; Path analysis; Students",,,,"Binus University","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported in part by Bina Nusantara University under BINUS Research Grant.","Colquitt, J., Jeffrey, A.L., Wesson, M., (2011) Organizational Behavior: Improving Performance and Commitment in the Workplace, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Dalmeri, (2016) SPIRIT Character in Islam Perspective, , Jakarta: Personal Paper; Debra, L.N., Quick, J.C., (2006) Organizational Behavior: Foundations, Realities, and Challenges, , South Western: Thomson; Huang, M., (2016) SPIRIT Character in Confucianism Perspective, , Jakarta: Personal Paper; Gibson, J.L., Ivanicevich, J.M., Donnelly, J.H., Konopaske, R., (2009) Organizations, Behavior, Structure, Processes, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Kadir, S., (2010) Jakarta: Rosemata Sampurna; Kinicki, A., Kreitner, R., (2010) Organizational Behavior, Key Concepts, Skills, and Best Practices, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Martorejo, N., (2016) SPIRIT Character in Christianism Perspective, , Jakarta: Personal Paper; McShane, S.L., Glinow, M.V., (2010) Organizational Behavior, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Mullins, J.L., (2005) Management and Organizational Behavior, , New Jersey: Prentice Hall; Ponijan, L., (2016) SPIRIT Character in Buddhist Perspective, , Jakarta: Personal Paper; Robbins, P., Judge, T.A., (2011) Organizational Behavior, , New Jersey: Pearson Prentice Hall; Schermerthorn, R.J., Jr., Uhl-Bien, M., Osborn, R.N., (2011) Organizational Behavior, , New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Slavin, R., (1991) Educational Psychology, Theory in to Practice, , Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall; Suhardi, U., (2016) SPIRIT Character in Buddhist Perspective, , Jakarta: Personal Paper",,,"BK21 Plus Project, University of Ulsan;University of Ulsan","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","10th International Conference on Human System Interactions, HSI 2017","17 July 2017 through 19 July 2017",,129837,,9781509046881,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Among all characters that are integral to the professional attitude is the ability to manage time ideally which is known as time management skills. This skill is so much decisive for the promotion of one’s career that requires the students to build a good habit of effective time management. This research attempts to describe how the above average level students (with GPA above 2.8) of double degree program manage their time. By using the method of direct observation and interviews, the research found that their academic achievement is so much determined by their ability to manage time. Their good time management habit significantly constitutes their professional attitude which would define their career progress in the future. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Character; Discipline; Professionalism; Time management",,,,,,,"Covey, S.R., (1998) The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, , Binarupa Aksara, Jakarta; de Janasz, S.C., (2009) Interpersonal Skills in Organizations, , McGraw Hill, Boston; Claessens, J.C.B., Van Eerde, W., Rutte, G.C., Roe, R., A Review of Time Management Literatur (2007) Personnel Review, 36, pp. 255-276; Macan, T.H., Shahani, C., Dipboye, R.L., Phillips, A.P., (1990) Journal of Educational Psychology, 82, p. 760; Yager, J., (2004) Creative Time Management, , Bhuana Ilmu Populer, Jakarta; Hamzah, A.R., Lucky, E.O., Joarder, M.H., Time Management, External Motivation, and Students’ Academic Performance: Evidence from a Malaysian Public University (2014) Asian Social Science, 10, pp. 55-63; Kirillov, A.V., Tanatova, D.K., Vinichenko, M.V., Makushkin, S.A., Theory and Practice of Time-Management in Education (2015) Asian Social Science, 11, pp. 193-204; Yukselturk, E., Bulut, S., Predictors for Student Success in an Online Course (2007) Educational Technology and Society, 10, pp. 71-83; Lay, H.C., Schouwenburg, H., (1993) Journal of Social Behavior and Personality, 8, p. 647","Martoredjo, N.T.; Character Building Development Center, Indonesia",,,"American Scientific Publishers",,,,,19366612,,,,"English","Adv.

Selected values are generally performed by trial and error. This study evaluates performance of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and two optimizers combined with changes in 6 learning rate values. Researched optimizers are Adaptive Moment Estimation and RMS Prop in wildlife animal classification domain. Other hyperparameter values are set same. The architectures are implemented on DenseNet 121, ResNet 50 and AlexNet. This study recommends best value of learning rate for training process which will be conducted with conditions similar to this study and provide other insights during study. The images in this study used wild animals with various positions from front side, back side and some part of bodies that describe real condition. In contradiction to other studies which generally use images in the hundreds of thousands to millions, the number of images used is 47, 841 taken from the Serengeti Season 1 Snapshot with imbalance conditions.

There is much information and knowledge that are discussed among a lecturer and students in forums as a part of the learning process. The motivation of this study is to evaluate the learning process in a discussion forum through a dashboard, namely, the Dashboard of Knowledge (DoK). The DoK is formed using an Information Retrieval Architecture and Entity Relationship Diagram that is designed using four category interfaces. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the learning evaluation through the DoK is measured by a survey. The survey is conducted using three out of four dimensions of multi-criteria of the Web-based E-Learning System (WELS), namely, the Learner Interface, the System Context, and Personalization. The respondents of the survey are the heads of department that are DoK users. The results show that most respondents strongly agree that the DoK is useful for evaluating the learning in a discussion forum. This is exhibited by the survey results that show an average score of 3.53 out of 4.00 and 84.32% satisfaction. These results reveal that the DoK can effectively assist heads of department in monitoring the effectiveness of the learning process in a discussion forum. © 2013 IEEE.","Data warehouses; discussion forums; e-learning","Data warehouses; E-learning; Surveys; Discussion forum; Entity relationship diagrams; Four dimensions; Learning evaluations; Learning management system; Learning process; Personalizations; Web-based e-learning systems; Learning systems",,,,,,"Garrison, D., Kanuka, H., Blended learning: Uncovering its transformative potential in higher education (2004) Internet Higher Edu., 7 (2), pp. 95-105. , Apr; Tripathi, R., Kurle, D., Jalgaonkar, S., Sarkate, P., Rege, N., Implementation of supplemental E-learning models for blended learning in pharmacology (2017) Nat.

Despite a discussion is opened by submitting a thread as the topic of discussion, however, the discussion may open out to different topics. This paper aims to present a model to find out a topic of discussion through latent semantic approach, named Topics Finding Model (TFM). The model proposes a complete step to reveal the topic of discussion from a thread in a discussion forum, consisting of the pre-processing text document, corpus classification and finding a topic. The model can be applied in various discussion forums and various languages with a few adjustments, such as stop-word removal list and stemming algorithm. The data were obtained from discussion forum in a learning management system. The data consist of 1050 posts divided into three different course subjects: information systems, management, and character building. The reason for using several course subjects is to observe consistency of the model. F-measure was used to measure the effectiveness of the model, and the results showed that the TFM was consistent and effective to reveal the topic of discussion, with a good precision. However, the recall can still be increased in a further study. © 2019, The Author(s).","Discussion forum; Latent semantic; Learning management system; Topics finding model",,,,,,,"Baeza-Yates, R., Ribeiro-Neto, B., (2011) Modern Information Retrieval: The Concept and Technology behind Search (Second Edition), , Addison-Wesley Professional Harlow; Benedetti, F., Beneventano, D., Bergamaschi, S., Simonini, G., Computing inter-document similarity with context semantic analysis (2018) Information Systems, 80, pp. 136-147; Berger, A., Lafferty, J., Information retrieval as statistical translation (1999) In Proceedings of the 22Nd Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, , https://doi.org/10.1145/312624.312681; Botev, V., Marinov, K., Schäfer, F., Word importance-based similarity of documents metric (WISDM): Fast and scalable document similarity metric for analysis of scientific documents (2017) Proceedings of the 6Th International Workshop on Mining Scientific Publications, 7, pp. 17-23. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3127526.3127530; Cutting, D.R., Karger, D.R., Pedersen, J.O., Tukey, J.W., Scatter/gather: A cluster-based approach to browsing large document collections (2017) ACM SIGIR Forum, 51, pp. 148-159. , &; Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (1999) Proceedings of the fifteenth conference on uncertainty, pp. 1-7; Ezen-Can, A., Boyer, K.E., Kellogg, S., Booth, S., Unsupervised modeling for understanding MOOC discussion forums: A learning analytics approach (2015) In Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, pp. 146-150; Hofmann, T., Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (1999) Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 289-296; Hofmann, T., Unsupervised learning by probabilistic latent semantic analysis (2001) Machine Learning, 42 (1-2), pp. 177-196; Hong, C., Chen, W., Zheng, W., Shan, J., Chen, Y., Zhang, Y., Parallelization and characterization of probabilistic latent semantic analysis (2008) Parallel processing, 2008.

The aim of this paper was to determine the appropriate topics for a discussion forum for learning management systems through enhanced probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) with the corpus classifier algorithm. In preparing the paper, the methods used were PLSA and the classifying process, which classifies the documents to become a corpus based on the similarity word approach. The similarity word is influenced by the term-frequency of the word in the document. The novel concept in this paper is the corpus classifier algorithm. The experiment was conducted using three approaches to discover the topic, and it used 4,868 distinct words from 234 documents. The documents were contained in three threads subject. The post of the discussion forum is the text document. The performance of the result was measured by the f-measure, which was calculated for each thread subject. The corpus classifier algorithm was used in the second approach, and third approach increased the average f-measure values for the second and third thread subjects by approximately 24 and 17%, respectively. © BEIESP.","Corpus classification; Discussion forum; PLSA; Similarity word; Topic findings",,,,,,,"Chowdhury, A.K., Shanmugan, V., Information Technology: Impacts on Environment and Sustainable (2015) Pertanika J.

This can lead to a loss, especially when applied in the industrial world. The purpose of this research is to fix an illumination factor, particularly the shadow factor on an image that will be detected by combining two methods, namely adaptive single scale retinex and shadow removal. Smoothing from retinex and shadow removal process are performed after an image is captured. Accuracy of object detection obtained is 95.45%, using experimental image detection program and random sampling method from 22 images of two datasets used in this study. Namely “Shadow Removal Online Dataset and Benchmark for Variable Scene Categories” and “Klik BCA” which obtained from the simulation process. This method can be applied to real time conditions, where the speed of the process is stable and fast enough such that it can be applied into industrial companies to help their quality control. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Illumination; Image processing; Shadow detection","Database systems; Lighting; Object detection; Object recognition; Adaptive single-scale retinex; Image detection; Industrial companies; Light intensity; Random sampling method; Scene categories; Shadow detections; Simulation process; Image processing",,,,,,"Andreopoulos, A., Tsotsos, J.K., 50 years of object recognition: Directions forward (2013) Comput.

The stemming is tightly related to basic word or lemma and the sub lemmas. The lemma and sub lemma of Indonesian Language have been grown and absorb from foreign languages or Indonesian traditional languages. Our approach provides the easy way of stemming Indonesian language through flexibility affix classification. Therefore, the affix additional can be applied in easy way. We experiment with 1,704 text documents with 255,182 tokens and the stemmed words is 3,648 words. In this experiment, we compare our approach performance to the confix-stripping approach performance. The result shows that our performance can cover the failure in stemming reduplicated words of confix-stripping approach. © 2016 IEEE.","indonesian language; information retrieval; stemming","Computers; Electrical engineering; Information retrieval; Mathematical techniques; Foreign language; Indonesian languages; stemming; Text document; Computer science",,,,,,"Sharma, D., Cse, M., Stemming algorithms: A comparative study and their analysis (2012) International Journal of Applied Information Systems (IJAIS), 4 (3), pp. 7-12; Sinaga, A., Adiwijaya, N.H., Development of word-based text compression algorithm for Indonesian language document (2015) 3rd International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICOICT), pp. 450-454; Willett, P., The Porter stemming algorithm: Then and now (2006) Emerald Insight, 40 (3), pp. 219-223; (2008) Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia, , 4th ed., Departemen Pendidikan Nasional; Adriani, M., Asian, J., Nazief, B., Stemming Indonesian: A confix-stripping approach (2007) ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing, 6, pp. 1-33; Asian, J., Williams, H., Tahaghoghi, S., Stemming Indonesian (2005) Conferences in Research and Practice in Information Technology Series, 38, pp. 307-314; Arifin, A.Z., Mahendra, I.P.A.K., Ciptaningtyas, H.T., Enhanced confix stripping stemmer and ants algorithm for classifying news document in Indonesian language (2009) International Conference on Information & Communication Technology and Systems, pp. 149-158; Frakes, W.B., Fox, C.J., Strength and similarity of affix removal stemming algorithms (2003) ACM SIGIR Forum, 37, pp. 26-30; Waridah, E., (2015) EYD Ejaan Yang Disempurnakan & Seputar Kebahasa-Indonesiaan, , Ruang kata; Alwi, H., Dardjowidjojo, S., Lapoliwa, H., Moeliono, A.M., (2003) Tata Bahasa Baku Bahasa Indonesia, , 3rd ed., Balai Pustaka",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","13th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology, ECTI-CON 2016","28 June 2016 through 1 July 2016",,123682,,9781467397490,,,"English","Int.

In this paper, illumination is the issue of segmenting various objects. This work proposed and evaluated two methods for image segmentation. First, we proposed region growing based method to find region that represented object of interest. Second, we proposed edge suppressing based method by the use of analyzing tensor. The experiment demonstrated that region growing method has limitation in image segmentation for object color variation. The system shows effectiveness of the method by implementing edge suppressing method in three different objects as foreground object, and four different objects as background object. Using edge suppressing, this system performed successfully under different illumination intensities. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Color; Edge suppressing; Illumination; Region growing; Segmentation",,,,,,,"Acharjya, P., Das, R., Ghoshal, D., Study and Comparison of Different Edge Detectors for Image Segmentation (2012) Global Journal of Computer Science and Technology Graphic and Vision, 12, pp. 29-32; Agrawal, A., Raskar, R., Chellapa, R., Edge Suppressing by Gradient Field Transformation using Cross-Projection Tensor (2006) IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2, pp. 2301-2308; Almaddah, A., Mae, Y., Ohara, K., Takubo, T., Arai: Visual and Physical Segmentation of Novel Objects (2011) IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Robots and System, pp. 807-812; Beevi, Y., Natarajan, S., An Efficient Video Segmentation Algorithm with Real Time Adaptive Threshold Technique (2009) International Journal of Signal Processing, Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, 61, pp. 304-311. , Springer, Heidelberg; Cretual, A., Chaumette, F., Bouthemy, P., Complex Object Tracking by Visual Servoing Based on 2D Image Motion (1998) Proceedings of the IAPR International Conference on Pattern Recognition, pp. 1251-1254. , Australia; Desouuza, G.N., Kak, A.C., Vision for Mobile Robot Navigation: A Survey (2002) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, pp. 237-267; Gonzales, R.C., Woods, W.E., (2001) Digital Image Processing, , Prentice Hall, New Jersey; Hai-Bo, L., Yo-Mei, W., Yu-Jie, D., Fast Recognition Based on Color Image Segmentation in Mobile Robot (2010) Proceedings of the Third International Symposium on Computer Science and Computational Technology, 2 (1), pp. 1-4; Kaushal, M., Singh, A., Singh, B., Adaptive Thresholding for Edge Detection in Gray Scale Image (2010) International Journal of Engineering Science and Technology, pp. 2077-2082; Li, P., Chaumette, F., Tahri, O., A Shape Tracking Algorithm for Visual Servoing (2004) IEEE Int.

Three leading online travel agent such as Traveloka, Tiket, and Agoda use Facebook for supporting their business as customer service tool. This study is to measure customer satisfaction of Traveloka, Tiket, and Agoda by analyzing Facebook posts and comments data from their fan pages. That data will be analyzed with three machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to determine the sentiment. From the classification results, data will be selected with the highest f-score to be used to calculate the Net Sentiment Score used to measure customer satisfaction. The result shows that KNN result better than Naive Bayes and SVM based on f-score. Based on Net Sentiment Score shows companies that get the highest satisfaction value of Traveloka followed by Tiket.com and Agoda. © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

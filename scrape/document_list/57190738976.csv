However, its policies in promoting these values at the global level remain limited. This can be seen in Indonesia’s reluctance to strengthen global human rights governance, particularly in the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council. In addressing the puzzle, this article shows that Indonesia’s standpoint on the global human rights issue does not stem from Indonesia’s search for autonomy from Western values. Rather, it is suggested that Indonesia’s historical memory is behind Indonesia’s reluctance to strengthen global governance dealing with human rights issues. Specifically, Indonesia’s history in protecting its territorial integrity under UN scrutiny during the authoritarian regime (1967-1998) shapes its current approach to the separatist movement in Papua provinces. Moreover, its role as a voice for developing countries, which is an integral part of its historical memory, causes Indonesia to protect abusive regimes. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","emerging power; historical memory; Human rights governance; Indonesian foreign policy; UN Human Rights Council",,,,,,,"Aaberg, A., McCaig, J., Gaino, E., Habbu, A., Vidal, A.C., Lee, T.-H., (2008) Daily update Human Rights Council, 7th Session 28 March, , http://olddoc.ishr.ch/hrm/council/dailyupdates/session_007/28_march_2008.pdf, 2008 (Human Rights Monitor Series).

This article argues that multilateral trade governance is utilised by Indonesian foreign policymakers to be the arena for Indonesia’s aspiration to exercise a greater role at the global level. This aspiration is reflected in its support towards liberalisation agenda at the global level. However, the commitments made, as well as the rhetoric calling for a more liberalised multilateral trading system within the Round, are not in line with Indonesia’s protectionist-leaning domestic trade policies. This condition, arguably, is the result of the co-optation of trade policy in Doha Round by the Indonesian foreign policy agenda. While the Ministry of Trade has full authority to formulate trade negotiation position, Indonesia’s aspiration for international status pursued by foreign policymakers has significantly influenced its trade policy agenda in the Doha Round. Thus, Indonesia’s behaviour in the Doha Round can only be interpreted as role-playing in which Indonesia ‘play the role’ to enhance its international status rather than based its position on coherent domestic economic interest. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Doha Development Round; foreign policy; Indonesia; trade policy; WTO",,,,,,,"(2014) The Bali decision on stockholding for food security in developing countries, , https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/agric_e/factsheet_agng_e.htm, WTO.

It argues that cross-border regionalism projects are best understood as sites for scalar contestation over regulatory control between central and local government. Moreover, scalar contestation around cross-border regional projects is characterised by the struggles to control relationships with transnational capital between elites operating at different tiers of the state. When elites at different scales have conflicting interests and strategies, this can cause policy incoherence, inhibiting the development of cross-border regionalism. Conversely, when they align, and intersect with the interests of transnational business, cross-border regionalism can succeed. To illustrate the argument, this article utilises the comparative case studies of the Batam free trade zone and West Kalimantan–Sarawak cross-border cooperation. © 2019, © 2019 Global South Ltd.","borderland; central–local dynamics; Indonesia; politics of scale; regionalism; State transformation","border region; central-local relations; comparative study; cross-border relations; decentralization; regionalism; Batam; East Malaysia; Greater Sunda Islands; Indonesia; Malaysia; Riau Islands; Sarawak; Sumatra; Sunda Isles; West Kalimantan",,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: DP1701102647

Rather than treating it as merely a function of material capability or good international citizenship, this article resituates middle power as a concept of international status that states aim to pursue through the enactment of role conceptions. Thus, it reinstates a conceptual distinction between ‘middle-power status’ and ‘middle-power roles’. The article suggests that the notion of role conceptions can analytically connect the status-seeking behaviour of middle powers with their foreign policy agenda. In so doing, it provides a more nuanced explanation of middle-power behaviour, which might differ between one middle power and another. Using Indonesia and South Korea as case studies of middle power, this article contends that foreign policymakers have strategically conceptualised and enacted several main roles that aim to capture historical experience, as well as ego and alter expectations, in order to pursue middle-power status. These role conceptions determine the foreign policy agenda of states in articulating their middle-power status. © 2018, © 2018 Australian Institute of International Affairs.","foreign policy analysis; Indonesia; middle power; role conception; role theory; South Korea","analytical framework; citizenship; conceptual framework; foreign policy; policy making; political power; power relations; Indonesia; South Korea",,,,,"This work was supported by the Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education [grant number 20140912301708] and a US-Indonesia Society Sumitro Fellowship.","Beeson, M., Higgott, R., The Changing Architecture of Politics in the Asia-Pacific: Australia’s Middle Power Moment?

Kemanggisan Ilir III No. 45., Jakarta, Indonesia","This paper examines the dynamics of the development of Euro-Islam as a discourse which offers a modern interpretation of Islam that fits with European context. It investigates how Europe-wide Muslim umbrella organisations promote Euro-Islam discourse while at the same time gain position to represent European Muslims at the European level by mobilising the discourse. Drawing from constructivist literature, this paper argues that Tariq Ramadan’s version of Euro-Islam has been in the stage of socialisation characterised by (1) the existence of network of organisational platforms such as Federation of Islamic Organisation in Europe (FIOE) and Forum of European Muslim Youth and Student Organisations (FEMYSO), (2) the support from supranational actors such as European Parliament and European Commission, and (3) the efforts to codify the discourse through the creation of the Muslims of Europe Charter. However, given the lack of organisational infrastructure to diffuse the discourse due to the diverse nature of Muslim communities in Europe, further internalisation of the discourse has been hindered. Additionally, the connection between Euro-Islam’s organisational platforms with Islamist movement has made the discourse on Euro-Islam being perceived as a camouflage for Islamist agenda. Thus, at this stage, Euro-Islam has become “empty signifier” that are open to continual contestation which serves Muslim umbrella organisations with speaker position to lobby at the European level. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Constructivism; Discourse; Euro-Islam; European Muslims; Integration; Muslim communities; Muslim organisations","Islamism; social construction; socialism; Europe",,,,,,"Adida, C.L., Laitin, D.D., Valfort, M.-A., Identifying barriers to Muslim integration in France (2010) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 107 (52), pp. 22384-22390; Al-Azmeh, A., Fokas, E., (2007) Islam in Europe: diversity, identity and influence, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; AlSayyad, N., Castells, M., (2002) Muslim Europe or Euro-Islam: politics, culture, and citizenship in the age of globalization.

This paper argues that Indonesia's aspiring role as a democracy promoter is not a manifestation of a firm and coherent democratic political culture, which is more likely to be a permanent feature of states. Thus, rather than seeing it as firmly established state identity, instead, Indonesia's democratic identity should be seen as role conception articulated by foreign policy elites in its quest for international prestige. Its role as a democracy promoter has enabled Indonesia to enhance its other roles conceptions such as a regional leader in Southeast Asia as well as a bridge-builder at the global level. However, this paper further argues that Indonesia's role as a democracy promoter has also been hindered due to the inter-role conflicts arising from its enactment of multiple roles. As a result, Indonesia's enactment of the role as democracy promoter has relatively less impactful towards democratization in the region. To substantiate this argument, the paper examines Indonesia's strategies in promoting democracy and human rights in three case studies, namely Indonesia's role in mainstreaming human rights in ASEAN, Indonesia's democracy promotion through the Bali Democracy Forum, and Indonesia's engagement towards democratization in Myanmar. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ASEAN; Bali democracy forum; democracy promotion; Indonesian foreign policy; Myanmar; role theory","ASEAN; democracy; democratization; foreign policy; human rights; Bali; Indonesia; Lesser Sunda Islands; Myanmar; Sunda Isles",,,,,,"Acharya, A., (2013) The Making of Southeast Asia: International Relations of a Region, , Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press; Acharya, A., (2014) Indonesia Matters: Asia's Emerging Democratic Power, , Singapore: World Scientific; Adam, A., Understanding the role of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Human Rights (2014) Forum-Asia Working Paper Series: Asian Perspectives on International Human RIghts Landscape, , Ilango R.I., (ed), ed., Bangkok: Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (FORUM-ASIA); Aggestam, L., Role theory and European foreign policy: a framework of analysis (2006) The European Union's Roles in International Politics, pp. 11-29. , Elgström O., Smith M., (eds), eds, London: Routledge; PBB Harapkan Peran RI Dalam Proses Demokratisasi di Myanmar (2008) Antara, , http://www.antaranews.com/berita/93406/pbb-harapkan-peran-ri-dalam-proses-demokratisasi-di-myanmar, 17 April 2015; US supports Indonesia's APEC 2013 chairmainship (2012) antaranews.com, , http://en.antaranews.com/news/84329/us-supports-indonesias-apec-2013-chairmainship; Anwar, D.F., The impact of domestic and Asian regional changes on Indonesian foreign policy (2010) Southeast Asian Affairs, 2010 (1), pp. 126-141; Anwar, D.F., Foreign policy, Islam and democracy in Indonesia (2011) Journal of Indonesian Social Sciences and Humanities, 3, pp. 37-54; Azra, A., (2006) Indonesia, Islam, and democracy: Dynamics in a Global Context, , Jakarta: Equinox Publishing; Bertrand, J., (2004) Nationalism and Ethnic Conflict in Indonesia, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Borchers, H., (2013) Indonesia's National Role Conceptions: Continuity Amidst Regional Change, , unpublished Master Degree, Wellington: Victoria University of Wellington; Brazinsky, G.A., The United States and Multilateral Security Cooperation in Northeast Asia (2008) Asian Perspective, 32 (2), pp. 21-36; Breuning, M., Roles and realities: when and why gatekeepers fail to change foreign policy (2013) Foreign Policy Analysis, 9 (3), pp. 307-325; Budianto, L., Indonesia's ‘credibility to play role’ in Myanmar transition (2010) The Jakarta Post, , http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/04/14/indonesia%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98credibility-play-role%E2%80%99-myanmar-transition.html; Caballero-Anthony, M., The ASEAN Charter: An Opportunity Missed or One That Cannot Be Missed?

Two institutional reforms have been made to create better governance for Indonesian migrant workers in the post-authoritarian era. One was the establishment of the National Agency for the Placement and Protection of Indonesian Migrant Workers (BNP2TKI) while the other was the granting of greater responsibility to sub-national governments to supervise migrant worker recruitment. In spite of these institutional reforms, little progress has been made in the protection of Indonesian migrant workers. The paper reveals that the restrictive regulatory framework for the recruitment of migrant workers, which curbs private recruitment agencies, does not create better migrant worker governance. This regulatory framework does not take into consideration the horizontal relationship between the old and new institutions, and the vertical relationship between the central and sub-national governments. Horizontally, the institutional design of the proposed new regulatory framework has created institutional rivalry between the newly established regulatory actor and the old one. Vertically, the reluctance of central government to decentralise authority to sub-national governments has curtailed the ability of sub-national governments to perform a supervisory role in the recruitment process. These two inter-related factors have hindered the efforts to create a better recruitment process for Indonesian migrant workers. © 2017 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","BNP2TKI; decentralisation; Indonesian migrant workers; institutional dynamics; institutional rivalry; sub-national governments",,,,,,,"Adi, A.P., Pemda Diminta Kembalikan Dana Deposito Cabang pptki (2014) Bisnis.com, , Accessed on 11 October 2014; (2013) Exploited for Profit, Failed by Government: Indonesian Migrant Domestic Workers Trafficked to Hong Kong, , London: Amnesty International Ltd.

In response to this question, exceptionalists argue that there will be no balancing behaviour against China from Southeast Asian states, while soft balancing theorists argue that the balancing behaviour has already occurred in the form of institutional balancing. This article refutes those arguments and maintains that balancing behaviour is not yet apparent in Southeast Asian balancing, yet it exists in an indirect form. In order to make this argument, this article examines the recent military build-up among Southeast Asian states as well as recent assessments of the ineffectiveness of the Southeast Asian regional security framework. The article also further analyses the conditions under which Southeast Asia's indirect balancing might turn into hard balancing. © 2016 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","Balance of power; balancing; bandwagoning; China's naval build-up; Southeast Asia",,,,,,,"Waltz, K.N., Structural realism after the Cold War (2000) International Security, 25 (1), pp. 5-41; Friedberg, A.L., Ripe for Rivalry: Prospects for peace in a multipolar Asia (1993) International Security, 18 (3), pp. 5-33; Mearsheimer, J.J., The future of the American pacifier (2001) Foreign Affairs-New York, 80 (5), pp. 46-61; Mearsheimer, J., (2001) The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, , New York: W.W.

Yet, few studies try to analyze how religion can transform Ethnic Civil War with religious divides into Religious Civil War, especially when the rebels identify themselves as Muslims. Currently, there are two conventional arguments on factors transforming ethnic civil war into religious civil war: the structural and the mobilization explanation. Using the Chechen war as a case study, this paper finds that the structural explanation failed to explain how ethnic civil war where religion is peripheral issue transforms into religious civil war where religion is central issue. While the mobilization explanation can only partially explain the Chechen civil wars it cannot answer the question how the ethnic civil war turns to religious civil war. The evidence clearly suggests that the involvement of transnational religious actors in the form of foreign fighters is the main factor that transforms ethnic civil war with religious divides into religious civil war. © 2013 CEU Political Science Journal.","Chechen civil war; Islam; Religion; Transnational religious actors",,,,,,,"Akhmadov, I., Lanskoy, M., (2010) The Chechen Struggle: Impendence, Won, and Lost, , New York: Palgrave Macmillan; Al-Shishani, M.B., (2006) The Rise and Fall of Arab Fighters In Chechnya, , http://www.jamestown.org/fileadmin/Recent_Reports/Trans_amd_Speaker_NCC09142006/Al-Shishani-14Sep06.pdf, Washington DC: The Jamestown Foundation, Database on-line.

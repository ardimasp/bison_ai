To make ads industry to be more efficient, prediction model for ads' click-through rate is needed. In this research, Field-aware Factorization Machine (FFM) is going to be optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) on FFM parameters to increase the accuracy of the FFM. In this research, FFM and PSO-FFM is compared with accuracy and execution time. Our experimental results show PSO can increase FFM performance. © 2018 IEEE.","elick-through rate; FFM; PSO-FFM","Factorization; Click-through rate; Execution time; Factorization machines; Internet users; Online ads; Online advertising; Prediction model; PSO-FFM; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",,,,,"Harden, L., Heyman, B., Marketing by the numbers: How to measure and improve the roi of any campaign (2011) AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn; Chapelle, O., Manavoglu, E., Rosales, R., Simple and scalable response prediction for display advertising (2015) ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST); Juan, Y., Zhuang, Y., Chin, W.-S., Lin, C.-J., Field-aware factorization machines for ctr prediction (2016) Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems; Rendle, S., Factorization machines (2010) 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM); Elbeltagi, E., Hegazy, T., Grierson, D., Comparison among five evolutionary-based optimization algorithms (2005) Advanced Engineering Informatics; Engelbrecht, A.P., (2007) Computational Intelligence: An Introduction, , John Wiley & Sons",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd International Conference on Computer and Communication Systems, ICCCS 2018","27 April 2018 through 30 April 2018",,139804,,9781538663509,,,"English","Int.

Generally, this technique converts the input image into an editable format in computer. This paper uses several techniques as a comparison for some extracted features, such as: zoning algorithm, projection profile, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and combination of those feature extractions (zoning + projection, projection + HOG, zoning + HOG, zoning + projection + HOG). For the evaluation of the proposed system, this paper compare the most commonly classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This experiment achieves the highest accuracy of 94.43% using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with the feature extraction algorithms are:projection profile and the combination of zoning + projection profile. © 2017 The Authors.

However, it is still difficult to obtain adequate healthcare services in Indonesia. Many of Indonesian have chosen to seek treatment in neighboring countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Australia. As a result, a lot of foreign exchange flows into those countries. Such problems exist in health support efforts. The scarcity of human resources, especially in the field of highly capable nursing, is a field that will be cultivated by the Summit. The other problems in the field of nursing training make it necessary for the Summit to be clever in integrating strategies, the business processes with the use of information system and technology. The variety of competition and tight government regulations forced the Summit to continue to exist and to be able to compete in the future using information systems and technology. For this reason, Summit uses the EA3 Enterprise Architecture Framework approach so that challenges can be overcome while taking advantage of opportunities and gaining competitive advantage. It is hoped that with this design of the information system and technology strategy, investment in the field can be directed and the business objectives that have been set can be achieved. © 2020 IEEE.","Enterprise architecture; Information system and technology; Nursing education services; Strategy design","Competition; Information management; Information systems; Laws and legislation; Nursing; Business objectives; Competitive advantage; Enterprise Architecture; Government regulation; Healthcare services; Improving performance; Information systems and technologies; Technology strategies; Information use",,,,,"Mahendradhata, Y., The republic of Indonesia health system review (2017) World Health Organization; Media, K.C., (2020) Pasar Terbesar di ASEAN, Bagaimana Peluang Industri Kesehatan Indonesia?, , KOMPAS.com; Egeham, L., (2019) HEADLINE: Lompatan Jokowi Untuk Indonesia Maju, Bagaimana Pelaksanaannya?, , liputan6.com, Aug. 17; Martin, L., Nursing skills: Is there a shortage?

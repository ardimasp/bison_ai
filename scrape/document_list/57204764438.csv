Regarding the context of humor in the political setting, humor can be used as a means of increasing morale and hope for individuals who feel discontent with the current political climate. Poking fun at politics has become even more widespread with the help of the Internet, which provides a medium in which different varieties of political humor are more easily accessible to the public. This study investigates the role of political humor appreciation types in predicting political dogmatism. The predictive-correlational design was conducted on 128 university students (67 males, 61 females; Mean of Age = 22.27 years old; Standard Deviation of Age = 3.33 years) in Greater Jakarta, Indonesia, recruited through convenience sampling technique. Multiple linear regression results showed that appreciation of the benign humor type has an inverse predictive relationship with political dogmatism. In contrast, appreciation of the subversive and undermining humor types can predict dogmatism in positive directions. Appreciation of the supportive humor type does not play a role in the dynamic of political dogmatism. The practical implication of this study is that the strategic use of each type of political humor needs to be carefully arranged so as not to be counterproductive. © Common Ground Research Networks, Kharisma Murti, Tommy Prayoga, Juneman Abraham, Tirta Nugraha Mursitama, All Rights Reserved.","Appreciation; Dogmatism; Political Humor",,,,,,"Abraham, J., Pane, M.M., The mediating role of social competition identity management strategy in the predictive relationship between susceptibility to social influence, internet privacy concern, and online political efficacy (2014) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8407, pp. 492-499. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-55032-4_50; Abraham, J., Prayoga, T., Takwin, B., Political psychology of Indonesian political figure: A case study of a political entrepreneur who is not hesitant in paving a new way (2018) International Journal of Research Studies in Psychology, 7 (1), pp. 35-58. , https://doi.org/10.5861/ijrsp.2018.1863; Afrianty, D., (2016) Islam and Politics: Indonesia'S Identity Crisis, , http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/11/islam-politics-indonesia-identity-crisis-161121082414557.html, Aljazeera, November 22; Antawirya, A., (2013) Interview with The Corruptor, , https://ahmadantawirya.wordpress.com/2013/03/07/218/; Applegate, M., Cohen, J., Communicating graphically: Mimesis, visual language, and commodification as culture (2017) Cultural Politics, 13 (1), pp. 81-100. , https://doi.org/10.1215/17432197-3755204; Aritonang, M.S., Sapiie, M.A., Heriyanto, D., #Jenderalkardus vs. #Jenderalbaper: Twitterati mock prabowo, SBY in upset fallout (2018) The Jakarta Post, , http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/08/09/jenderalkardus-vs-jenderalbaper-twitterati-mock-prabowo-sby-in-upset-fallout.html, August 9; (2018) “'Apa Urusan Anda Menanyakan Itu' Dan Hal Lain Soal Wawancara Edy Rahmayadi” ['What Your Business Is About by Asking That' and Other Things About The Interview with Edy Rahmayadi], , https://www.bbc.com/indonesia/trensosial-45637696, BBC Indonesia; Bippus, A., Factors predicting the perceived effectiveness of politicians' use of humor during a debate (2007) Humor-International Journal of Humor Research, 20 (2), pp. 105-121. , https://doi.org/10.1515/HUMOR.2007.006; CAMEO Fun Campaign: Jokowi Presiden (2014) YouTube Video, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vi5l7h_YQx4; Fun Campaign: Prabowo Jokowi (2014) YouTube Video, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hITLHh0flPoandt=348s, -; Colom, G.G., Alcover, C.T., Sánchez-Curto, C., Zárate-Osuna, J., Study of the effect of positive humor as a variable that reduces stress: Relationship of humor with personality and performance variables (2011) Psychology in Spain, 15 (1), pp. 9-21; Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T., (2004) Introduction to Political Psychology, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Damanik, C., (2018) “Kronologi Kasus Meiliana Yang Dipenjara Karena Keluhkan Pengeras Suara Azan” [The Chronology of Case of Meiliana Who Was Imprisoned for Complaining Azan Loudspeakers], , https://regional.kompas.com/read/2018/08/23/15053451/kronologi-kasus-meiliana-yang-dipenjara-karena-keluhkan-pengeras-suara-azan, Kompas, August 23; Dewberry, D.R., Fox, R., Easy as 1, 2, 3: Rick Perry and self-deprecation as image restoration (2012) Journal of Contemporary Rhetoric, 2 (1), pp. 1-10; Ebbighausen, R., Indonesia is on the brink of disaster (2017) Deutsche Welle, , http://www.dw.com/en/indonesia-is-on-the-brink-of-disaster/a-37528124; Fadhil, H., PPP-NasDem-PSI nilai prabowo 'the winter soldier' cuma ikut-ikutan” [PPP-NasDem-PSI judged the prabowo's 'the winter soldier' to be just a conforming expression] (2018) DetikNews, , https://news.detik.com/berita/4261734/ppp-nasdem-psi-nilai-prabowo-the-winter-soldier-cuma-ikut-ikutan, October 18; Ferguson, M.A., Ford, T.E., Disparagement humor: A theoretical and empirical review of psychoanalytic, superiority, and social identity theories (2008) Humor: International Journal of Humor Research, 21 (3), pp. 283-312. , https://doi.org/10.1515/humor.2008.014; Ford, T.E., Ferguson, M.A., Social consequences of disparagement humor: A prejudiced norm theory (2004) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 8 (1), pp. 79-94. , https://doi.org/10.1207/S15327957PSPR0801_4; (2017) “Ternyata Raja Salman Dukung Ahok” [It Turned Out That King Salman Supported Ahok], , https://twitter.com/gerilyapolitik/status/836874963110014977, GerilyaPolitik. @GerilyaPolitik; Gibbons, S., How to include politics in your marketing without turning anyone off (2017) Entrepreneur, , https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/292018, March 28; Gross, R., (2010) Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behavior, , 6th ed.

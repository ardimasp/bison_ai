Well managed and integrated public transportation will be an important thing for achieving sustained economic growth and a reduction in rural poverty. Purpose of this study is to provide an application that can help people to access information of public transportation routes in rural and underdeveloped regions. In addition, people will also get information about cost and distance estimation. Method- ology used in this study is Waterfall which consists of data collection, design and analysis, development, and evaluation. Result of this study is an application that provides public transportation routes shown on the map, so that users can reach the initial shuttle point from his/her current position to the destination point.

Learning materials are mostly available in form of book and anatomy mannequin (puppet), but it is still insufficient enough to help students in understanding human body anatomy. Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that combines a real thing into virtual environment interactively. This research purpose is to develop an AR application for human body anatomy learning to be more interesting and easier for student to understand. This application enables student to learn human body anatomy with 3D object interaction while previously using textbook and mannequin. Research method in for this study is by using quantitative method that collects data and then develops the prototype to prove the impact. Application development method is done by using waterfall method that includes planning (collect data and analysis), design (user interface and diagram), implementation, and testing. Research result is AR application for human body anatomy learning that contains 3D object, organ explanation and position that can be accessible on web. © 2018 The Author(s).","3D object; augmented reality; human anatomy; human organ","Artificial intelligence; Augmented reality; Students; User interfaces; Virtual reality; 3D object; Application development; Human anatomy; Human organs; Junior high schools; Learning materials; Quantitative method; Web-based augmented realities; E-learning",,,,,,"Siltanen, S., (2012) Theory and Applications of Marker-based Augmented Reality, , Technical Research Centre of Finland 39; Juan, C., Beatrice, F., Cano, J., An augmented reality system for learning the interior of the human body (2008) Advanced Learning Technologies, 2008.

For teachers, authoring tool is a solution that can help them in designing materials with interactive video. For students, interactive learning materials will certainly increase interest and understanding of the material. Goal of this research is to build an authoring tool for producing interactive video to be run on the browser. The methodology used was the RUP (Rational Unified Process) which consists of Inception, Elaboration, Construction, and Transition phases. Result of this study is an authoring tool application for designing and producing interactive video and generating it to HTML5 platform. Conclusions obtained are the authoring tool can help teachers to design teaching materials in the form of interactive video, and use it in teaching and learning process to increase students understanding of material. © 2017 The Authors.

Inappropriate or unproductive land will impact to productivity decrease, time-consuming, and profit lost. Determining and evaluating the optimal land suitability can be done through prediction of each production area that is obtained by analyzing land fitness data. This study proposes the implementation of Neural Network and Swarm Optimization Algorithm (Particle Swarm Optimization & Cat Swarm Optimization) to obtain prediction of production. To evaluate the proposed method, this study performed comparative evaluation based on the Mean Square Error (MSE) and accuracy. Based on the experimental results, Cat Swarm Optimization produces minimum error equal of 0.00439 for training phase and 0.10453 for testing phase. In training phase, Cat Swarm Optimization produces higher accuracy (93%) than Particle Swarm Optimization (67%). © 2016 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Cat swarm optimization; Land suitability; Neural network; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm optimization algorithm",,,,,,,"Brambilla, I., Porto, G.G., Farm Productivity and Market Structure.

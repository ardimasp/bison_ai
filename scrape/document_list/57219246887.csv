Joglo-roofed buildings are still very popular in Indonesia, especially for the people of Central Java. Joglo roof is a roof that has two different slope angles, and has a partner on the other side of the mirror. The angle in the meeting of two roofs on the same side must be greater than 180O. Unsteadystate heat equations can represent temperature distribution in joglo-roofed buildings. Using a finite difference scheme with the ghost point method that is solved numerically and uses the Quadratic Extrapolation approach, unsteady-state heat equations can be solved. The results of this simulation aim to be a reference that can be used by construction industry workers in the construction of buildings that have a joglo roof. This research results in the fact that the longer the time given, the high temperature value will decrease by itself due to heat distribution. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

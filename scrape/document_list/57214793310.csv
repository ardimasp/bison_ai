This study was conducted at the Jakarta Toll Gate namely Semanggi I, Semanggi II and Halim. Data is obtained from observations when the driver pays the cost of the expressway at the toll gate. This study shows a reaction time for the payment of expressway costs, which are influenced by types of motorized vehicles such as sedans, jeeps, buses, and trucks. The results show that the reaction time of driver when before and after paying, the longest toll road costs is 48 seconds and the shortest is 1 second. Reaction time for the payment of expressway costs could shorten the travel time, with an average reaction time of 6.04 seconds on vehicles. The number of vehicles crossing the toll gate on 24 hours from the three Toll Gates amount 17.256 vehicles. As a result, Most of vehicle traffic contributed by the behavior of driver at the Toll Gate. © 2019 IAEME Publication.","Driver; Jakarta; Reaction time; Toll gate; Vehicles",,,,,,"Green, M., Perception-reaction time: Is olson (and sivak) all you need to know?

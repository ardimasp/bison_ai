The aim is to achieve good governance which is a manifestation of political communication. It is a process where government and society must continue interacting to create a society-oriented government. The society-based government as a manifestation of democracy has been carried out but it does not include all regions in Muna district. This is due to several factors, namely; (1) Inadequate land and sea transportation facilities due to the government’s transportation policy; (2) economic inequality; (3) insufficient job opportunities; and (4) education. The study concludes Muna district embodies democratic principles of governance based on populist principles (from the people, by the people, and for the people). © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Democracy; Government; Political communication; Society",,,,,,"Aras, M., (2014) Komunikasi Politik; Suatu Pendekatan Praktis, , Jakarta: Binus Media & Publishing; Aras, M., (2015) Komunikasi Politik; Suatu Pendekatan Teoritis, , Jakarta: Binus Media & Publishing; Arifin, A., (2014) Perspektif Ilmu Politik, , Jakarta: Pustaka Indonesia; (2016) Bagaimana Sistem Pemerintahan Komunis, , http://www.bimbingan.org/bagaimana-sistempemerintahan-komunis.html, n.d.

In this research, we use setting agenda theory and frame analysis. While the research conducted through qualitative method by using primary data (observation and interview) and secondary data (media and documents). Research shows that political parties aware of the role of television as the most effective media in delivering political messages, including giving image for political parties. Political parties usually take cooperation and creativity method as well as measuring and even forcing news setting agenda of such television channels. However, one of the issues that may rise problems in democracy in Indonesia is that national television channels are controlled and owned by elite political parties.

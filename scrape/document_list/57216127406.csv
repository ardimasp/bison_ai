One of the ways is to modified asphalt mixture with High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE). This is also useful for reducing environmental problems due to daily use of plastic. This study investigates the performance of asphalt mixture with High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) substitution with variants of 0%, 2%, 4% and 6% by asphalt weight in the mixture. In this study, the asphalt mixing process conducted by two methods such as wet and dry method and using the original seeds of High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) substitution and chopped High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) substitution. The performance of asphalt mixture with High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) substitution was analyzed using Marshall test that based on Asphalt Pavement Spesification (Bina Marga, 2018) and Cantabro Abrasion Loss (CAL) test in terms of strength, stiffness, and durability characteristics. Laboratory result showed that asphalt mixture substitution by original seeds of High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) with dry method gives the maximum stability that is 1970.8 kg at 6% High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) substitution content. But, only in level content of 2-4% High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) substitution substitution which qualifying the specification such as Stability, Void In Mixture (VIM), Void in Mineral Aggregates (VMA), Void Filled with Asphalt (VFA), and Marshall Quotient (MQ). © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Cantabro Abrasion Loss; Concrete asphalt; Dry method; HDPE; Marshall Characteristic; Wet method","Abrasion; Aliphatic compounds; Durability; Erosion; High density polyethylenes; Mixtures; Abrasion loss; Environmental problems; High density polyethylene(HDPE); Marshall Characteristic; Marshall Quotient; Mineral aggregate; Modified asphalts; Wet method; Asphalt mixtures",,,,,"(2018) Spesifikasi Umum Divisi 6, , Directorate General of Highways; Rahmawati, A., (2017) Perbandingan Penggunaan Polypropilene (PP) Dan High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) Pada Campuran LASTON-WC; Survey Results and Plastic Waste Research, pp. 2015-2018. , Ministry of Environment and Forestry; Aschuri, I., Yamin, A., Widyasih, Y.D., (2016) The Use of Waste Plastic As A Partial Substitution Aggregate in Asphalt Concrete Pavement; Rahmawati, A., Rosyada, M.A., Nega, P., (2015) Perbandingan Pengaruh Penambahan Plastik High Density Polyetilene (HDPE) Dalam Laston-WC Dan Lataston-WC Terhadap Karakteristik Marshall; Elhamy, M.Z., (2018) Pengaruh Penggunaan Plastik High Density Polyethylene Pada Lapis Aspal Beton AC-WC Terhadap Karakteristik Marshall; Tajudin, A.N., Suparma, L.B., Pemanfaatan Limbah Plastik HDPE Sebagai Agregat Pengganti Pada Campuran (2014) Asphalt Concrete - Binder Course (AC-BC); (2014) Cantabro Loss Test Procedure; Ismail, Karim, (2011) Polymers to Improve Asphalt Pavement; Lopang, I., Pengaruh Penggunaan Plastik HDPE Sebagai Bahan Aditif Terhadap Aspal Dengan Agregat Kasar Hasil Limbah Beton (2018) Jurnal Teknik Dan Ilmu Komputer",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

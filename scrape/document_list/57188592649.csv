The demand of this kind of robot should be very high and should be used in schools for the future. We would like to propose behavior-based humanoid robot with the proposed model and algorithms to be used by robot to teach basic mathematics and give entertainment such as storytelling and singing. This kind of robot can be used in schools. In our scenario, robot will detect and recognizes user's face and accept commands from the user to do an action such as giving tutorial and questions, specifically in teaching basic mathematics, where the answer from user will be processed to the Google Translator and the result will be compared with vocabularies defined on the system. The comparative experiments with samples from students were presented. © 2017 IEEE.","Behavior-based humanoid robot; Humanoid robot; Indonesian language; Mathematics","Anthropomorphic robots; Education computing; Intelligent robots; Mathematical techniques; Robots; Students; Teaching; Basic mathematics; Behavior-based; Comparative experiments; Humanoid robot; Indonesian languages; Intelligent humanoid robots; Model and algorithms; Natural interactions; Educational robots",,,,,,"Feil-Seifer, D., Matari, M.J., Ethical principles for socially assistive robotics (2011) IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine, 18 (1), pp. 24-31; Jones, L., Robot, J., (2004) Programming: A Practical Guide to Behavior-Based Robotics; Khan, P.H., What is a human?

Classic research in psychology found that stability of marriage is based on the ability to create and maintain a positive interaction ratio five times more than negative interactions. Based on that, we present Counselove, a mobile application intended to record information of daily positive behaviors (joking, showing affection) of couples who use the application. We propose a method where the apps can determine users' marital satisfaction level and also can help users increasing their marital satisfaction based on the relationship satisfaction questionnaire and the assessment of user's self reported behaviors to their partners using fuzzy logic. The experimental results shown the application is running well on mobile devices based on Android platform. Lastly, we provide result of in depth interview with two users. Further research and development of the Counselove apps are discussed. Copyright © 2017 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Previously, humanoid robot focused on the architecture of body and ethical issues, but later, it is predicted that humanoid robots should consider teaching behaviour, student's interest and speech understanding. They are expected to conclude the answer through conversation under noisy environment. We propose speech recognition systems based on Google translator and basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as stemming and tokenization. We do teach modules for elementary school in order that the robot can interact with students naturally based on psychological aspects. We also discuss about our recent humanoid robot for education in elementary school that has ability to detect user's face and accepts commands in sentences from the user to do any actions such as giving tutorial and answering questions. The average accuracy for correct recognition is 73.3% and correct answer is 63.3%. Our speech recognition system is more promising compared with NAO robot. © 2017 The Authors.

Classic research in psychology found that stability of marriage is based on the ability to create and maintain a positive interaction ratio 5 times more than negative interactions. Based on that, we propose a method to record information of daily positive behaviors (joking, showing affection) of couples that using our application. We propose a method where the apps can determine users' marital satisfaction level and also can help the users to increasing their marriage satisfaction based on the assessment of the results of questionnaire and the assessment of user's behaviors to their partners using fuzzy logic. The experimental results are presented and shown the application is running well on mobile devices based on Android platform. © 2015 IEEE.","android; fuzzy logic; marriage apps","Behavioral research; Computer circuits; Fuzzy logic; Information science; Mobile devices; Reconfigurable hardware; android; Android platforms; Negative interaction; Positive interaction; Psychological Aspects; Record information; Android (operating system)",,,,,,"Duvall, E.M., Miller, B.C., (1985) Marriage and Family Development, , New York: Harper & Row; Lauer, R.H., Lauer, J.C., (2000) Marriage & Family: The Quest for Intimacy, , 4th Ed.

Unfortunately the development of adaptive educational games that consider the psychological aspects for student on mobile platforms in Indonesian language that interesting and entertaining for learning process is very limited. This paper shows the research of development of novel adaptive games for students who can adjust the difficulty level of games based on the ability of the user, so that it can motivate students to continue to play these games. We propose a method where these games can adjust the level of difficulty, based on the assessment of the results of previous problems using neural networks with three inputs in the form of percentage correct, the speed of answer and interest mode of games (animation / lessons) to producel output. The experimental results are presented and show the adaptive games are running well on mobile devices based on BlackBerry platform. © 2013 IEEE.","Adaptive games; BlackBerry; Neural Networks","Education; Mobile devices; Neural networks; Students; Adaptive games; BlackBerry; Educational game; Indonesian languages; Learning process; Level of difficulties; Mobile applications; Psychological Aspects; Animation",,,,,,"Nicola, W., Encouraging engagement in game based learning (2011) International Journal of Game-Based Learning, 1 (1), pp. 75-84; Ming-Chun, C., Shyan-Ming, Y., An adaptive mobile application development framework (2005) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer Publisher, 3824, pp. 765-774; Tapscott, D., (1998) Growing Up Digital: The Rise of the Net Generation, , New York: McGraw Hill; Timur, B., Tasar, M.T., In-service science teachers' technological pedagogical content knowledge confidences and views about technology-rich environments (2011) Center for Educational Policy Studies Journal, 1 (4), pp. 11-25; Prensky, M., Digital natives' digital immigrants (2001) On the Horizon, 9 (5); De Freitas, S., (2006) Learning in Immersive Worlds.

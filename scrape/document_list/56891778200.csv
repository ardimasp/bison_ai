It reflects how the Westerners view the Easterners. The title of the study aims to explore the concept of Orientalism from a selected western novel by Updike entitled Terrorist. The novel portrays the image of a Muslim-Arab character; Ahmad who is the protagonist of the novel Terrorist. The paper also shows how Muslim-Arabs are drawn to terrorism not because of their nature which are prone to terrorist acts but are due to the misinterpretation of the Holy Quran. The paper consists of three sections: the first section is an introduction about Updike's Terrorist The second section tackles the different viewpoints pertaining to the concept of Orientalism. Section three analyses Updike's novel as an Orientalist novel. Finally, the conclusion and recommendation for further studies are forwarded. © 2018, Universidad del Zulia.

Using Micro Enterprises (MEs) in traditional markets around Jakarta - Indonesia as the object of the research, approximately 20% MEs were found to have no banking facilities. Furthermore, instead of using credit facility, around 78% MEs still utilise their own capital to facilitate their businesses. The paper also examines the personal characteristics that can explain financial inclusion. Results revealed that only gender and education could explain financial inclusion. Morever, the findings also revealed that MEs generally demand for banking facility. Nevertheless, there are several barriers that hamper them from financially included. In particular, Self Exclusion and Marketing Exclusion are the most barriers that MEs face in accessing financial services.","Financial Exclusion; Financial Inclusion; Micro Enterprises",,,,,,"Amaeshi, K.M., (2006) Financial Exclusion, Financial Institutions and Corporate Social Responsibility: A Developing Country Perspective, , Working Paper, Social Science Research Network (SSRN), Rochester, NY; Cnaan, R.A., Moodithaya, M.S., Handy, F., Financial inclusion: Lessons from rural south India (2012) Journal Social Policy, 41 (1), pp. 183-205; Fuller, D., Mellor, M., Banking for the poor: Addressing the needs of financially excluded Communities in Newcastle Upon Tyne (2008) Urban Studies, 45, pp. 1505-1524; Hannig, A., Jansen, S., Financial inclusion and financial stability: Current policy issues (2011) ADBI Working Paper Series, (259); Khaki, A.R., Sangmi, M.D., Financial inclusion in Jammu &kashmir: A study on bankers Initiatives (2012) Journal of Arts, Science &commerce, III, 4 (2), pp. 115-123; Leyshon, A., Signoretta, P., French, S., (2006) The Changing Geography of British Bank and Building Society Branch Networks 1995-2003, , http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/geography/general/news-events/; Mitton, L., (2008) Financial Inclusion in the UK: Review of Policy and Practice, , Bristol: Joseph Rowntree Foundation; (2009) Financial Inclusion: An Overview, , NABARD.

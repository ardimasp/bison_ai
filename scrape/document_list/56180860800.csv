In that situation user must have system with advance technology so person do not worry when getting away from his home. It is therefore the purpose of this design to provide home security device, which send fast information to user GSM (Global System for Mobile) mobile device using SMS (Short Messaging System) and also activate - deactivate system by SMS. The Modular design of this Home Security System make expandable their capability by add more sensors on that system. Hardware of this system has been designed using microcontroller AT Mega 328, PIR (Passive Infra Red) motion sensor as the primary sensor for motion detection, camera for capturing images, GSM module for sending and receiving SMS and buzzer for alarm. For software this system using Arduino IDE for Arduino and Putty for testing connection programming in GSM module. This Home Security System can monitor home area that surrounding by PIR sensor and sending SMS, save images capture by camera, and make people panic by turn on the buzzer when trespassing surrounding area that detected by PIR sensor. The Modular Home Security System has been tested and succeed detect human movement. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",,,,,,,"Azid, S.I., Kumar, S., Analysis and performance of a low cost SMS based home security system (2011) International Journal of Smart Home, 5 (3); Khan, S.R., Al Mansur, A., Kabir, A., Jaman, S., Chowdhury, N., Design and implementation of low cost home security system using GSm network (2012) International Journal of Scientific and Engineering Research, 3 (3); Valouch, J., Integration of alarm systems (2012) International Journal of Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity, 3; Azid, S.I., Sharma, B., Intelligent home: SMS based home security system with immediate feedback (2012) World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, 72; Mahendran, N., Joe Mathai, G., Veenesh, M.U., Multiple sensor feeding supported building automation system using arduino platform with exposure of 802.15.4 functionalities (2013) International Journal of Engineering Trends and Technology, 4 (2); http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno, Arduino Uno website; http://www.simcom.eu/index.php?m=letoltes, Simcom GSM modem website; http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/File:Twig_-_BISS0001.pdf, Seedstudio PIR sensor website; http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/Digital_Buzzer_Module_(SKU :_DFR0032), DFRobot Buzzer Alarm website; http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/Real_Time_Clock_Module_(DS1307 )_(SKU:DFR0151), DFRobot Realtime clock website; http://seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Serial_Camera, Twig Serial Camera website; http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/ MicroSD_card_module_for_Arduino_%28SKU:DFR0229%29, MicroSD Adapter for Arduino website",,,"","EDP Sciences","2013 International Conference on Advances Science and Contemporary Engineering, ICASCE 2013","23 October 2013 through 24 October 2013","Jakarta",,21016275,,,,"English","EPJ Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901468914

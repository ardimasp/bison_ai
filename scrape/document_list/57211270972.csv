In today's digital era, social media is not only a means of communication but also a means of self-expression, used by both individuals and organizations. The utilization of social media, especially by brands are interesting to observe. This research focused on question of how social media platforms were utilized by each brand to achieve branding and marketing goals? At present, little work has been carried out regarding this topic, especially for Indonesian brands. By examining the elements of how these brands used social media platforms, hopefully it can enlighten others to strengthen their online brands presence and identity. Using qualitative approach, and case study as a method, this study chose three Indonesian brands in F B (CHAMBER), fashion (PVRA) and personal (Edho Zell) which represents a brand in products, services, and personal self. Content analysis were used to analyze and build common themes. Data analysis followed three phases of data reduction, data display, and interpretation. The result shows that the utilization of social media for these three brands is still for short-term marketing goals or activations. There is little or almost no long-term relationships engagement in the posts. Moreover, the three brands already knew their target audiences in social media. And although these brands have different goals of social media utilization, they already developed solid brand identity. © 2019 IEEE.","brand identity; brand story; digital marketing; social media","Commerce; Information management; Marketing; Brand identity; brand story; Content analysis; Digital marketing; Long-term relationships; Qualitative approach; Social media; Social media platforms; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Kemp, S., (2019) Digital 2019: Indonesia, , https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2019-Indonesia, Retrieved June 2019; Bollier, S., (2014) Voting in the 'World's Social Media Capital, , http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/07/voting-worldssocial-media-capital-2014725397392826.html, Retrieved October 2017 from; Rampersad, H., A new blueprint for powerful and authentic personal branding (2008) Performance Improvement, 47 (6), pp. 34-37. , July; Diamond, S., (2013) The Visual Marketing Revolution: 26 Rules to Help Social Media Marketers Connect the Dots, , Que Publishing; Solis, B., (2017) You Are at the Center of the Conversation Prism, , http://www.briansolis.com/2013/07/you-are-at-thecenter-of-the-conversation-prism/, Retrieved March 2017 from; Goel, R., An empirical study to enquire the effectiveness of digital marketing in the challenging age with reference to Indian economy (2017) Pertanika Journals of Social Sciences and Humanities, 25 (4), pp. 1569-1584; Clarke, T., (2019) Instagram Stats That Marketers Can't Ignore This Year, , https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagramstatistics/, Retrieved June 2019 from; Ginsberg, K., Instabranding: Shaping the personalities of the top food brands on instagram (2015) The Elon Journal of Undergraduate Research in Communications, 6 (1), pp. 78-91; Lavoie, K.A., Instagram and branding: A case study of Dunkin' Donuts (2015) The Elon Journal of Undergraduate Research in Communications, 6 (2), pp. 79-90; Keller, K.L., Conceptualizing, measuring, and managing customerbased brand equity (1993) Journal of Marketing, 57 (1), pp. 1-22; Bauer, H.H., Stokburger-Sauer, N.E., Exler, S., Brand image and fan loyalty in professional team sport: A refined model and empirical assessment (2008) Journal of Sport Management, 22 (2), p. 205; Aaker, D., (2002) Building Strong Brands, , London: Simon & Schuster; Gladden, J.M., Funk, D.C., Developing an understanding of brand associations in team sport: Empirical evidence from consumers of professional sport (2002) Journal of Sport Management, 16 (1), p. 54; Ross, S.D., Segmenting sport fans using brand associations: A cluster analysis (2007) Sport Marketing Quarterly, 16 (1), pp. 15-24; Fournier, S., Avery, J., The uninvinted brand (2011) Business Horizons, 54 (3), pp. 193-207; Pedersen, P.M., Miloch, K.S., Laucella, P.C., Strategic sport communication (2007) Human Kinetics, 10 (2), pp. 176-187; Wallace, L., Wilson, J., Miloch, K., Sporting Facebook: A content analysis of NCAA organizational sport pages and Big 12 conference athletic department pages (2011) International Journal of Sport Communication, 4 (4), pp. 422-444; Kozinets, R.V., The field behind the screen: Using netnography for marketing research in online communities (2002) Journal of Marketing Research, 39 (1), pp. 61-72; Vollmer, C., Precourt, G., (2008) Always On: Advertising, Marketing, and Media in An Era of Consumer Control, , New York, NY:McGraw-Hill; Montoya, P., Vandehey, T., (2009) The Brand Called You, , USA:McGraw-Hill; Brakus, J., Brand experience: What is it?

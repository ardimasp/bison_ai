In Indonesia this issue received less attention from citizen, whereas it has significant roles in reducing greenhouse gas emission. This paper initiated a study about eco-driving tendency behavior among Indonesian people, the objective is to see whether current behavior support or not, and does the differences between gender and age exist. Adopted on-line study method using an online form questionnaire, 27 questions developed consist of 8 items related to individual data, 19 items related to perception and driving behavior. The respond measures using 5 scale option answers (i.e. strongly disagree, disagree, quite agree, agree, and strongly agree). Based on average respondents' answers, can be concluded that the tendency of behavior somewhat supports to in line with eco-driving behavior. After Q15 and Q18 omitted based on Pearson-product moment correlation, further analysis results showed that most of respondents categorized into mild tendency behavior (109 respondents). However, a mild tendency among female respondents are higher than male, and the strong tendency of males is higher than female respondents. Based on gender, there are no significant tendency behavior differences between male and female (p-value = 0, 320), and also among age groups (30y, 31-40y, 41-50y, and >50y), even though age >50 have a lower tendency to the behavior compare to other groups. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Greenhouse gases; Age groups; Current behaviors; Driving behavior; Eco-driving; Environmental awareness; Indonesia; Product-moment correlation; Study methods; Behavioral research",,,,,"Ando, R., Nishihori, Y., How does driving behavior change when following an eco-driving car (2011) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 20, pp. 577-587; Delhomme, P., Cristea, M., Paran, F., Self-reported frequency and perceived difficulty of adopting eco-friendly driving behavior according to gender, age, and environmental concern (2013) Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 20, pp. 55-58; Lai, W.-T., The effects of eco-driving motivation, knowledge and reward intervention on fuel efficiency (2015) Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 34, pp. 155-160; Jamson, S.L., Hibberd, D.L., Jamson, A.H., Drivers' ability to learn eco-driving skills; Effects on fuel efficient and safe driving behaviour (2015) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 58, pp. 657-668; Transportation and Global Warming, , http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/climate_law_institute/transportation_and_global_warming, Center for Biological Diversity, [Online], [Accessed 3 August 2017]; (2017) Source of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, , https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions, Agency, U.

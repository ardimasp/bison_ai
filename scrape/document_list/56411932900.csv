Since the adoption of transfer learning in the field, the performance of the models in computer vision is significantly upgraded. The common transfer learning practice in computer vision research is to use state-of-the-art architectures in the ImageNet dataset as the backbone network. The best performing architecture in ImageNet is currently held by EfficientNet, which is a set of architectures that were progressively grown from a baseline architecture. By observing the EfficientNet development approach, it is natural to hypothesize that the smaller EfficientNet architecture is capable to contain the knowledge of the larger architecture. This hypothesis comes from the fact that the larger EfficientNet architecture was grown from the smaller architecture. Therefore, in this study, we experimented if it is beneficial to transfer the knowledge from the larger architecture to the smaller architecture of the EfficientNet. To achieve this goal, we proposed a transfer learning method that uses Knowledge Distillation as the knowledge transfer mechanism from the larger to smaller architecture. We found that the proposed method is able to upgrade the performance of each of the EfficientNet architecture. Several smaller architectures are even able to outperform the larger architecture that was trained using the standard transfer learning method. © 2020 IEEE.","deep learning; efficientnet; knowledge distillation; transfer learning","Computer vision; Data Science; Deep learning; Distillation; Distilleries; Knowledge management; Large dataset; Learning systems; Network architecture; Back-bone network; Base-line architecture; Development approach; Knowledge transfer mechanisms; Learning capabilities; State of the art; Training dataset; Transfer learning methods; Transfer learning",,,,"Nvidia","The experiment in this research was executed using the NVIDIA Tesla P100 supported by NVIDIA - BINUS AI R&D Center.","Pardamean, B., Muljo, H.H., Cenggoro, T.W., Chandra, B.J., Rahutomo, R., Using transfer learning for smart building management system (2019) Journal of Big Data, 6 (1), p. 110; Tan, M., Le, Q., EfficientNet: Rethinking model scaling for convolutional neural networks (2019) Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Machine Learning, Ser.

One approach for quality control is to have a system that can classify coffee beans based on the quality. This system can assist the small-medium coffee enterprises to monitor and secure their procurement. However, the coffee beans quality classification technology is currently unavailable to the small-medium coffee enterprises community. To address this issue, we developed a mobile application powered by a deep-learning-based model to automatically classify coffee beans quality via a mobile phone camera. The deep learning model used is chosen between ResNet-152 and VGG16 based on their performance to classify coffee beans quality. The result shows that ResNet-152 could achieve the highest accuracy of 73.3% and could also be embedded in a functional mobile application. © 2020 IEEE.","Classification; Coffee; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Mobile information system","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Information management; International trade; Learning systems; Mobile computing; Coffee beans; Learning Based Models; Learning models; Mobile applications; Mobile information systems; Mobile phone cameras; Quality classification; World market; Classification (of information)",,,,,,"Prabhakaran Nair, K.P., The agronomy and economy of important tree crops of the developing world (2010) Agron.

Without exception, the development of chatbot for the hotel receptionist tasks also demands a massive training dataset. Unfortunately, laborious effort and hefty time are needed to manually collect a dataset with that size. Therefore, an information system is needed to assist the dataset collection.

One of the possible solutions for this is to adaptively adjust appliances utilization according to activity level in the building. Thus, an intelligent activity estimation system needs to be developed. However, massive annotated dataset is necessary to train the system. Therefore, we propose a system that enables rapid data annotation to collect the massive dataset.

Unfortunately, the continuous flow of medical images in hospitals drives radiologists to prioritize quantity over quality. This work condition allows misinterpretation especially on ambiguous anatomical structures that resemble lung nodule for example enlarged lymph nodes and resulting in decreasing sensitivity and accuracy of malignant lung nodule detections and late diagnosis proven to be fatal to patients. To address the problem, this paper proposed a novel lung nodule detection and classification model using one stage detector called as “I3DR-Net.” The model was formed by combining pre-trained natural images weight of Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D) backbone with feature pyramid network to multi-scale 3D Thorax Computed tomography scan (CT-scan) dataset. I3DR-Net able to produce remarkable results on lung nodule texture detection task with mAP 49.61% and 22.86%, and area under curve (AUC) 81.84% and 70.36% for public and private dataset. Additionally, I3DR-Net successfully outperform previous state-of-the-art Retina U-Net and U-FRCNN + mean average precision (mAP) by 7.9% and 7.2% (57.71% VS 49.8% VS 50.5%) for malignant nodule detection and classification task. © 2020 The Authors","Computed tomography; Lung nodule; Object detection; Pattern recognition and classification; Transfer learning",,,,,"Nvidia","The experiment done in this paper was conducted using NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU granted by NVIDIA Corporation to NVIDIA ?

With current computational power and algorithm, it is possi-ble to process big data, especially biomedical data, to find a complicated pattern with reasonable computation time. Computational approach for phosphorylation site prediction is more time-efficient and need fewer resources compared to traditional. However, the accuracy of current computational methods for phosphorylation site prediction still needs to be improved. This paper aims to create a computational method for phosphorylation site prediction with better classification performance compared to previous studies. The data used in this research to train the XGBoost models are extracted features from 2 different databases from the previous studies. The test result show that our model gave the highest accuracy on 4 out of 6 datasets. To extend our research, the XGBoost model was retrained which focused on 100 most important features from previous experiment. However, the result does not imply that it has a better result compared to our first models. As the result showing that our models gave better accuracy compared to the previous studies in most of the datasets, we can conclude that XGBoost model is better in predicting phosphorylation sites compared to other methods. © 2020 the author(s).","Gradient tree boosting; Phosphorylation; Post-translational modification; Prediction; Protein sequence; Proteomics; XGBoost",,,,,"Binus University","This research is a collaboration between the Department of Computer Science, University of Lampung, and Bioinformatics and Data Science Research Center (BDSRC), Bina Nusantara University.

Its purpose was to determine the correlation between independent variables consisting of Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Attitude toward Using (AU) with dependent variable Behavioral Intention to Use (BIU). Data collection techniques were carried out by distributing questionnaires through group discussion forums. Respondents consisted of medical workers and health cadres both in Jakarta and Yogyakarta. Data were analyzed using correlation test and t-test. The results of the correlation test state that the correlation between PEU and AU is 0.30, which shows a weak correlation. Meanwhile, the correlation of PU and AU is 0.56, PEU and BIU is 0.41, and PU and BIU is 0.47, which are considered as moderate correlations. Finally, a strong correlation exists between AU and BIU. T-test results show that the effect of PU on AU is statistically significant with CI = 95%. Likewise, the effects of PEU on AU, AU towards BIU, PU towards BIU, and PEU towards BIU are significant (p < 0.05). © Kassel University Press GmbH.","Cancer early detection; Mobile learning; TAM",,,,,,,"Dyanti, G.A.R., Suariyani, N.L.P., Faktor-Faktor Keterlambatan Penderita Kanker Payudara Dalam Melakukan Pemeriksaan Awal Ke Pelayanan Kesehatan (2016) Jurnal Kesehatan Masyarakat, 11 (2), pp. 96-104. , https://doi.org/10.15294/kemas.v11i2.3742; Muljo, H.H., Perbangsa, A.S., Pardamean, B., Assessment of Online Learning Application for Health Education (2019) International Journal of Online and Biomedical Engineering, 15 (12), pp. 69-80. , https://doi.org/10.3991/ijoe.v15i12.11157; Setiati, E., (2009) Waspadai Empat Kanker Ganas Pembunuh Wanita, Kanker Rahim, Kanker Indung Telur, Kanker Leher Rahim, Kanker Payudara, , https://doi.org/10.18860/sains.v0i0.1862, Yokyakarta: Andi; Fernández, M.E., DeBor, M., Candreia, J.D.M., Dissemination of a breast and cervical cancer early detection program through a network of community-based organizations (2010) Health Promotion Practice, 11 (5), pp. 654-664. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839908325064; Ngoc Nguyen, T.-U., Tanjasiri, S.P., Kagawa-Singer, M., Tran, J.H., Foo, M.A., Community Health Navigators for Breast-and Cervical-Cancer Screening Among Cambodian and Laotian Women: Intervention Strategies and Relationship-Building Processes (2008) Health Promotion Practice, 9 (4), pp. 356-367. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839906290251; Muljo, H.H., Pardamean, B., Perbangsa, A.S., The implementation of online learning for early detection of cervical cancer (2017) Journal of Computer Science, 13 (11), pp. 600-607. , https://doi.org/10.3844/jcssp.2017.600.607; Davis, F.D., Perceived Usefullness, Perceived Ease of Use, and User Acceptance of Information Technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3). , https://doi.org/10.2307/249008; Quinn, C., (2000) MLearning, , Mobile, Wireless, In-Your-Pocket Learning.

For automation, an intelligent system needs to be developed. However, an intelligent system needs to be trained in a large dataset before it can be used reliably. In this paper, we present a transfer learning scheme to develop an intelligent system for smart building management system. Specifically, the intelligent system is able to count human inside a room, which can be utilized to adaptively adjust energy usage in a room. The transfer learning scheme employs a deep learning model that is pretrained on ImageNet dataset. To enable the human counting capability, the model is trained on a dataset specifically collected for human counting case. © 2019, The Author(s).","Building management system; Deep learning; Human counting;

For instance, one of the cases in PA, automated plant counting, is able to accelerate the process of plantation monitoring. Despite many previous researches have developed information system for PA, there is no system which can be used for plant counting automation. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce an information system design that is crafted for automated plant counting.

Protein phosphorylation is used to regulate various enzyme and receptor activations which include signal pathways. There have been many significant studies conducted to predict phosphorylation sites using various machine learning methods. Recently, several researchers claimed deep learning based methods as the best methods for phosphorylation sited prediction. However, the performance of these methods were backed up with the massive training data used in the researches. In this paper, we study the performance of simple deep neural network on the limited data generally used prior to deep learning employment. The result shows that a deep neural network can still achieve comparable performance in the limited data settings. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, machine learning has gained significant attentions as a way to build a classifier from labeled data which also can be implemented to build a gender classifier. In this study we develop gender classifier using two different datasets with different languages, English and Bahasa Indonesia. Each data from both datasets is represented by 20 acoustic features. Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) is used to build the classification model using all these features and trained only on English dataset. This model is evaluated in both dataset to get the performance matrices consist of accuracy, AUROC, precision and recall. Ultimately, using this model we also identify and compare important features from both dataset to see the different characteristics of English and Bahasa Indonesia speeches. © 2019 The Authors.

These are known as polygenic models and are useful in evaluating risk of disease in patients. These models, however, often do not include important non-genetic factors that are important to the prediction of the disease. In this paper, we explore the prediction of colorectal cancer in Indonesia from non-genetic factors using common machine learning algorithms: XGBoost and Elastic Net. The result of this study identified 8 features with strong importance from both XGBoost and Elastic Net. We recommend including these features as covariates in future genetic association studies of colorectal cancer in Indonesia. Ultimately these models may be implemented as tools to screen patients for colorectal cancer risk. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, because the classes distribution in LULC data is naturally imbalance, it is difficult to do the classification. In this paper, we employ Variational Semi-Supervised Learning (VSSL) to solve imbalance problem in LULC of Jakarta City. This VSSL exploits the use of semi-supervised learning on deep learning model. Therefore, it is suitable for classifying data with abundant unlabeled like LULC. The result shows that VSSL achieves 80.17% of overall accuracy, outperforming other algorithms in comparison. © 2017 IEEE.","Imbalanced Learning; Remote Sensing; Variational Autoencoder; Variational Semi-Supervised Learning","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Internet of things; Land use; Remote sensing; Auto encoders; Imbalance problem; Imbalanced Learning; Jakarta; Land use/land cover; Learning models; Overall accuracies; Semi- supervised learning; Supervised learning",,,,"Nvidia","ACKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to acknowledge supports for this project from Bioinformatics and Data Science Research Center, Bina Nusantara University and NVIDIA Education Grant.","Chawla, N.V., Japkowicz, N., Kotcz, A., Editorial: Special issue on learning from imbalanced data sets (2004) ACM Sigkdd Explorations Newsletter, 6 (1), pp. 1-6; Frasca, M., Bertoni, A., Re, M., Valentini, G., A neural network algorithm for semi-supervised node label learning from unbalanced data (2013) Neural Networks, 43, pp. 84-98; Li, S., Wang, Z., Zhou, G., Lee, S.Y.M., Semi-supervised learning for imbalanced sentiment classification (2011) IJCAI Proceedings-International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 22 (3), p. 1826; Kingma, D.P., Mohamed, S., Rezende, D.J., Welling, M., Semisupervised learning with deep generative models (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3581-3589; Bruzzone, L., Serpico, S.B., Classification of imbalanced remotesensing data by neural networks (1997) Pattern Recognition Letters, 18 (11), pp. 1323-1328; Waske, B., Benediktsson, J.A., Sveinsson, J.R., Classifying remote sensing data with support vector machines and imbalanced training data (2009) International Workshop on Multiple Classifier Systems, pp. 375-384. , Springer; (2015) The USGS Website, , http://www.usgs.gov/, [Online]; (2015) Badan Informasi Geospasial (BIG), Indonesian Geospasial Portal, , http://portal.ina-sdi.or.id/, [Online]; (2010) Klasifikasi Penutup Lahan, p. 28. , BSN - National Standarization Agency of Indonesia SNI 7645; Di Gregorio, A., (2005) Land Cover Classification System: Classification Concepts and User Manual: LCCS, , Food & Agriculture Org; Zhu, Z., Wang, S., Woodcock, C.E., Improvement and expansion of the fmask algorithm: Cloud, cloud shadow, and snow detection for landsats 47, 8, and sentinel 2 images (2015) Remote Sensing of Environment, 159, pp. 269-277. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article, [Online]; Kingma, D.P., Welling, M., Auto-encoding variational bayes (2014) Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), , http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114, [Online]; Kullback, S., Leibler, R.A., On information and sufficiency (1951) The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 22 (1), pp. 79-86; Campbell, J.B., Wynne, R.H., (2011) Introduction to Remote Sensing, , 5th ed.

In general, modifying the existing algorithm by assuming that the training data is imbalanced, is the only way to handle imbalance data. However, for a normal data handling, this way mostly produces a deficient result. In this research, we propose a class expert generative adversarial network (CE-GAN) as the solution for imbalance data classification. CE-GAN is a modification in deep learning algorithm architecture that does not have an assumption that the training data is imbalance data. Moreover, CE-GAN is designed to identify more detail about the character of each class before classification step. CE-GAN has been proved in this research to give a good performance for imbalance data classification. © 2018 The Authors.

In the recently, the cluster problem has been proven as NP-hard problem, thus, it can be solved with meta-heuristic algorithms, such as the particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and ant colony optimization (ACO), respectively. This paper proposes an algorithm called Fast Ant Colony Optimization for Clustering (FACOC) to reduce the computation time of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) in clustering problem. FACOC is developed by the motivation that a redundant computation is occurred in ACO for clustering. This redundant computation can be cut in order to reduce the computation time of ACO for clustering. The proposed FACOC algorithm was verified on 5 well-known benchmarks. Experimental result shows that by cutting this redundant computation, the computation time can be reduced about 28% while only suffering a small quality degradation. © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

To date, modern moving object detection methods require complex background modeling and thresholds tuning to confront illumination changes. This paper proposes an adaptive approach based on non-overlapping block texture representation. It aims to design a computationally light and efficient solution to improve the robustness of detection. We evaluate our proposed method on internal and public sequences and provide the quantitative and qualitative measurements. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the results of previous method and suitable for real-time challenges. © 2018 The Authors.

However, there are numerous difficulties in maintaining a reliable KM system. One of the challenges is to manage knowledge materials in video format. A video file contains complex data that lead to the difficulties in managing them. Without an intelligent system, managing videos for KM requires a laborious effort. In this paper, an intelligent framework for KM system, embedded with deep learning model, is proposed. The use of the deep learning model alleviates the heavy burden of video materials management in KM system.

State-of-the-art technique used in modeling this traffic flows is by using a linear model. In contrast, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has been the state-of-the-art technique in speech recognition, which data is also time-series. Therefore, we conjecture that the use of RNN can improve performance in dynamic bandwidth management based on traffic prediction. In this paper, we employ a variant of RNN called Deep Long Short Term Memory (DLSTM), which is common to be used in speech recognition. The result of this work shows that DLSTM is suitable for traffic prediction and is able to decrease packet loss ratio of a network system simulated using Network Simulator 3 (NS3). © 2016 IEEE.","deep long short term memory; dynamic bandwidth management; traffic prediction","Bandwidth; Brain; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Recurrent neural networks; Speech recognition; Time series; Dynamic bandwidth; Improve performance; Network simulators; Packet loss ratio; Recurrent neural network (RNN); State-of-the-art techniques; Time-series data; Traffic prediction; Long short-term memory",,,,,,"Fu, Z., Bai, J., Wang, Q., A novel dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm with correction-based the multiple traffic prediction in epon (2012) Journal of Networks, 7 (10), pp. 1554-1560; Jin, Z., Shu, Y., Liu, J., Yang, O.W.W., Prediction-based network bandwidth control (2000) Electrical and Computer Engineering 2000 Canadian Conference on, 2, pp. 675-679. , vol.2; Wei, Y., Wang, J., Wang, C., A traffic prediction based bandwidth management algorithm of a future internet architecture (2010) Intelligent Networks and Intelligent Systems (ICINIS 2010 3rd International Conference on, pp. 560-563. , Nov; Hosking, J.R., Fractional differencing (1981) Biometrika, 68 (1), pp. 165-176; Graves, A., Jaitly, N., Towards end-To-end speech recognition with recurrent neural networks (2014) Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-14, pp. 1764-1772. , http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v32/graves14.pdf, T.

However, collecting necessary ground truth data for research in this field requires a lot of effort. Therefore, this paper presents a method for constructing estimated ground truth data using classification. This method reduces the workload in collecting remote sensing ground truth data. The contribution of this paper is to prepare and provide estimated Land Cover/Land Use (LULC) ground truth data of Jakarta area using the proposed method. The estimated ground truth data then can be used along with remote sensing image of Jakarta area to form dataset, which can be used for remote sensing research. For the estimated ground truth data to be reliable, the employed classification model have to achieve a reasonably good result. This research compares several algorithms to find the classification model with the best result for this case. The experimental result shows that Neural Network with single hidden layer of 30 neurons achieves best test accuracy of 75.41%. The method of this paper has been successfully implemented to construct LULC dataset of Jakarta area. © 2016 IEEE.","classification; dataset; land cover; land use; remote sensing","Classification (of information); Image reconstruction; Land use; Classification methods; Classification models; dataset; Ground truth data; Hidden layers; Land cover; Land use/land cover; Remote sensing images; Remote sensing",,,,,,"Liu, Y., Cao, G., Sun, Q., Siegel, M., Hyperspectral classification via deep networks and superpixel segmentation (2015) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 36 (13), pp. 3459-3482. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2015.1055607, [Online]; Mnih, V., Hinton, G.E., Learning to detect roads in high-resolution aerial images (2010) Computer Vision-ECCV 2010, pp. 210-223. , Springer; Mnih, V., Hinton, G.E., Learning to label aerial images from noisy data (2012) Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-12), pp. 567-574; Halmy, M.W.A., Gessler, P.E., Hicke, J.A., Salem, B.B., Land use/land cover change detection and prediction in the north-western coastal desert of Egypt using markov-ca (2015) Applied Geography, 63, pp. 101-112. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622815001599, [Online]; Han, H., Yang, C., Song, J., Scenario simulation and the prediction of land use and land cover change in Beijing, China (2015) Sustainability, 7 (4), pp. 4260-4279; Mondal, A., Khare, D., Kundu, S., Mishra, P., Detection of land use change and future prediction with markov chain model in a part of narmada river basin, madhya pradesh (2014) Landscape Ecology and Water Management, Ser.

For this reason the method used is a quantitative research method which is carried out by distributing questionnaires to the respondents and then completing it by using path analysis. The results showed that Pancasila Education, especially the First Principle has no significant influence. It can be seen on the amounted 34,30%, while the effect of Religion Education on the Faithfulness Formation of the students is significant, which amounted to 59.4%. It can be concluded that Pancasila Education has smaller significant effect on the Faithfulness Formation of the students than Religion Education, which has significant effect. From the results of this study it became clear about the study of what types of education had a significant influence on the formation of the Faitfulness of the students. And the implication is that Religion Education should be delivered more intensively and seriously if we idealized to format faitfulness of our students as the young generation. Therefore, the students as the young generation not only having religion, but they have to be religious and faithful persons. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

It is used not only to link to their friends but also to obtain information. However, the rapid development of Facebook use has not only a positive impact but also a negative one. One that should be a concern is that the truth of the information posted in Facebook is not always accountable. Several users are likely to trust the information posted even though it is not reliable. As a result, it is not uncommon that the information on Facebook can actually make the disintegration on the nation. Therefore, this study is conducted to describe how Facebook can be used by young people to make Indonesian nation more integrated. The informants are nine students of Bina Nusantara University who are selected randomly. The data are collected using interview technique based on nine relevant questions. Then the data are analyzed using the theory of Uses and Gratifications. The results show that social media such as Facebook can be used by university students as a tool to maintain and develop Indonesian's national integration. They can also manage not to allow such media to make the nation disintegrated. This result implies that when social media is used wisely and positively, it supports the nation for sustainable integration. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Disintegration; Integration; Students; Facebook; Indonesia; It supports; Social media; Sustainable integrations; University students; Uses and gratifications; Young peoples; Social networking (online)",,,,,,"Yusuf, O., (2016), Hampir Semua Pengguna Internet Indonesia Memakai Facebook Online Tekno.com; Zakaria, I., (2015), Remaja Indonesia Makin Tergantung Dengan Facebook Ketika Liburan Online Tekno.com; Basilisco, R., Cha, K.J., Uses and gratification motivation for using facebook and the impact of facebook usage on social capital and life satisfaction among filipino users (2015) International Journal of Software Engineering and Its Applications, 9, pp. 181-194; Sianipar, A.P., Pemanfaatan youtube di kalangan mahasiswa (2013) USU, 2; Ha, Y.W., Kim, J., Libaque-Saenz, C.F., Chang, Y., Park, M.C., Use and gratifications of mobile sns: Facebook and kakaotalk in korea (2014) Telematics and Informatics, 32 (3), pp. 425-438; Irianto, A.M., Integrasi nasional sebagai penangkal etnosentrisme di indonesia (2013) Humanika, 18, pp. 1-9; Haryono, B., Sulistyo, E.T., Zuber, A., Model pendidikan partisispatif empat pilar bangsa bagi integrasi nasional (2013) Komunitas, 5, pp. 240-251",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Advance and Scientific Innovation, ICASI 2018","23 April 2018 through 24 April 2018",,148653,17426588,,,,"English","J.

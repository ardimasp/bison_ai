Numerous studies have been conducted on developing a building directory system for public visitors, however, to the best of our knowledge, little is known on a directory system for a campus building using 3D web-based simulation technology. This research paper presents a method to develop a building directory system which adopted 3D web-based simulation and conventional directory mode for each user interface. The system was developed using the user-center system design method which comprises of some iterative cyclesthat are aimed to achieved a usable design from user perspective. Although the system was primarily built based on the Joseph Wibowo Center Campus building as the model, the adopted technique is applicable to meet requirement of the various target building. The usability evaluation conformance test has shown promising results that the model was accepted by potential users. © 2012 IEEE.","3D web; 3D web-based simulation; directory system","3D web; Campus buildings; directory system; Potential users; System design method; Usability evaluation; User perspectives; Web-based simulations; Buildings; Information science; Iterative methods; User interfaces; Three dimensional computer graphics",,,,,"Bevan, N., International standards for HCI and usability (2001) Int.

Although numerous studies have been reported on developing web-based applications based on 3D technology, however, to the best of our knowledge, little is known on evaluating its visual communication efectiveness of this technology for a directory system in a university campus setting. This paper presents a case on the performance comparison between 3D directory system and 2D directory system in terms of visual communication effectiveness. Visual communication effectiveness of the building directory system is measured using time needed to learn overall building layout and time needed to find the predetermined location of interest. In this research, it is assumed that effectivity variable was only depends solely on the chosen technology to develop directory system. The tested 3D and 2D directory systems in this research are based on the Joseph Wibowo Center Campus building layout. The experiment involving volunteers found that the 3D directory system caused reduction of about 25% of time to learn the building layout in compared to that using its 2D counterpart. For locating a place, 2D directory system caused increase of about 6% time to locate the location of interest in compared to that without directory. While, 3D directory system caused reduction of about 19% time to locate the location of interest in compared to that without directory. © 2012 IEEE.","2D/3D directory system; Building directory system","2D/3D directory system; 3D technology; Building layout; Campus buildings; Communication effectiveness; Performance comparison; University campus; Web-based applications; Buildings; Information science; Technology; Visual communication; Web services; Three dimensional computer graphics",,,,,"Kellner, D., Critical Perspectives on Visual Imagery in Media and Cyberculture (2002) Journal of Visual Literacy, 22 (1), pp. 81-90; Keegan, S.N., Importance of Visual Images in Lectures: Case Study on Tourism Management Students (2007) Journal of Hospitality, Leisure, Sport and Tourism Education, 6 (1); Bamford, A., (2011) LiFE: Learning in Future Education.

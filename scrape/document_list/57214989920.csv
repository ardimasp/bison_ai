The reporting system commonly used utilizes query which consumes a large amount of time in order to generate results fulfilling requirements set by the user. In order to simplify and speed up reporting in digital world and eventually results in improvement of business, the business entity needs a system which can address problems quickly and easily. In this paper, data warehouse system which could simplify and speed up the reporting provisions that is needed by the business without having to modify the existing query being implemented. With Kimball approaches, the data to be reported could be customized in various forms in accordance with the requirements set by the entity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Rizzi, S., From star schemas to big data: 20+ years of data warehouse research (2018) J.

Physical security could be improved through the implementation of indoor positioning with a real-time monitoring system. Other than security needs, the information provided could be used for emergency evacuation purposes in a disastrous situation. Presently, indoor positioning is principally based on wireless signals, such as WiFi, RFID, Zigbee, Bluetooth, etc. This study designs a user access management system in the Data Center using indoor-positioning. For the indoor positioning method, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbor (FkNN) algorithms and Kalman Filter implementation are evaluated. The simulation result shows that the proposed method can improve the positioning accuracy until 8% compared to the existing method. © 2019 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.","Bluetooth Low Energy; Fuzzy kNN; Indoor Positioning; Kalman Filter; RSSI",,,,,,"Salas, A.C., (2014) Indoor Positioning System Based on Bluetooth Low Energy, , Degree's Thesis Submitted to the Faculty of the Escola Tècnica d'Enginyeria de Telecomunicació de Barcelona Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Barcelona; Kriz, P., Maly, F., Kozel, T., Improving Indoor Localization Using Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons (2016) Mobile Information Systems, pp. 1-11. , http://dx.doi.org/DOI:10.1155/2016/2083094; Sukhov, R.R., Amzakarov, M.B., Isaev, E.A., Advanced Data Center Economy (2013) Business Informatic, 2 (24), pp. 13-18; Dumsky, D.V., Isaev, E.A., Data centers for physical research (2015) Physics Procedia, 71, pp. 298-302. , http://dx.doi.org/DOI:10.1016/j.phpro.2015.08.330, Elsevier B.V; Lin, X.Y., Ho, T.W., Fang, C.C., Yen, Z.S., Yang, B.J., Lai, F., A mobile indoor positioning system based on iBeacon technology (2015) Proceedings of the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, 2015, pp. 4970-4973. , https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319507, EMBS, Milan; Van, H.T., Poorter, E.D., Crombez, P., Lemic, F., Handziski, V., Wirström, N., Wolisz, A., Moerman, I., Performance analysis of multiple Indoor Positioning Systems in a healthcare environment (2016) International Journal of Health Geographics, 15 (7), pp. 1-15. , https://doi.org/10.1186/s12942doi.org/10.1186/s12942-016-0034-z; Soewito, B., Wiguna, A., Suharjito, S., Diana, D., Bluetooth Low Energy: Comparing 4 Trilateration Models in Indoor Positioning System (2018) International Journal on Communications Antenna and Propagation (IRECAP), 8 (6), pp. 500-509. , https://doi.org/10.15866/irecap.v8i6.13476; Yang, Z., Liu, Y., Quality of Trilateration: Confidence-Based Iterative Localization (2010) IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 21 (5), pp. 631-640. , May; Zhuang, Y., Yang, J., Li, Y., Qi, L., El-Sheimy, N., Smartphone-based indoor localization with bluetooth low energy beacons (2016) Sensors (Switzerland), 16 (5), pp. 1-20. , https://doi.org/10.3390/s16050596; Hansen, R., Thomsen, B., Thomsen, L.L., Adamsen, F.S., SmartCampusAAU-an open platform enabling indoor positioning and navigation (2013) Proceedings of 14Th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management, 2, pp. 33-38; Karlsson, F., Karlsson, M., Bernhardsson, B., Tufvesson, F., Persson, M., Sensor fused indoor positioning using dual-band WiFi signal measurements (2015) Proceedings of European Control Conference (ECC), Linz, pp. 1669-1672; Zafari, F., Papapanagiotou, I., Enhancing iBeacon Based Micro-Location with Particle Filtering (2015) Proceedings of IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 1, pp. 1-7. , San Diego, CA; Deepesh, P.C., Akshay Tiwary, R.R., Vikram, N., Rao, and N.

Cloud computing emerges to address the limitations of organizational resources in deploying IT services. Due to its advantages, there are still many debates about how to apply cloud computing effectively. Many organisations have reported that embracing the cloud computing is not an easy task and surrounded with many complexities. The use of cloud computing depends heavily on the ability of the organization to adapt with cloud computing paradigm. In order to maximize the benefits of cloud application, each organisation needs to develop a systematic, broad, holistic, and pragmatic approach. Cloud computing maturity model (CCMM) is initated to provide easy tool for assessing current conditions and improve service capabilities related to cloud computing. Measurements the implementation of cloud computing however, is challenging task since it needs to address certain factors in both business and technical perspectives. The article applies the popular framework initiated by the Open Data Center Alliances (ODCA) cloud computing maturity model (CCMM) as essential reference to guide applying cloud environment. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Schroedl, H., Towards A Consumer Cloud Computing Maturity Model-Proposition of Development Guidelines, Maturity Domains and Maturity Levels; Hayes, B., Cloud computing (2008) Commun ACM, 51, pp. 9-11; Andrzejak, A., Kondo, D., Yi, S., Decision model for cloud computing under sla constraints (2010) Modeling, Analysis & Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS), 2010 IEEE International Symposium on, pp. 257-266; Etro, F., (2010) The Economics of Cloud Computing; Ponemon, L., (2010) Security of Cloud Computing Users, p. 12. , Islander, NY, USA: Ponemon Institute; Mattoon, S., Hensle, B., Baty, J., (2011) Cloud Computing Maturity Model Guiding Success with Cloud Capabilities, , California: USA Oracle Corp; Mell, P., Grance, T., (2011) The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing Others; Alhamad, M., Dillon, T., Chang, E., Conceptual SLA framework for cloud computing (2010) Digital Ecosystems and Technologies (DEST) 2010 4th IEEE International Conference on, pp. 606-610; Armbrust, M., Fox, A., Griffith, R., Joseph, A.D., Katz, R., Konwinski, A., A view of cloud computing (2010) Commun ACM, 53, pp. 50-58; Rajaraman, V., Cloud computing (2014) Resonance, 19, pp. 242-258; Ashari, A., Setiawan, H., Cloud computing: Solusi ICT?

The systems must be available at all times with an ever-on-The-job system, requiring a high availability system to keep the service operable 24×7×365. This issue brings the disaster recovery plan (DRP) becomes an important issue for the data and IT infrastructure. This is a very potential risk because the data will be constantly threatened by disturbance such as viruses, hackers or disasters such as natural disasters. This paper explains the concept rather than disaster recovery service planning and database replication. This study covers the evaluation, planning, implementation and testing of the disaster recovery solution. © 2018 IEEE.","business continuity; disaster recovery plan; high availability; recovery","Information management; Personal computing; Recovery; Viruses; Business activities; Business continuity; Database replication; Disaster recovery centers; Disaster recovery plan; High availability; High availability systems; IT infrastructures; Disasters",,,,,"Adnan, O., David, A., Roosevelt, M., (2011) Information Technology Disaster Recovery Plan: Case Study.

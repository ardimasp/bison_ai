Therefore, the use of knowledge should be managed and developed properly to produce maximum benefits, and to support the organisation's objectives. Although knowledge is considered important, many organisations in Indonesia still face many difficulties to measure and implement effective knowledge management (KM). Many corporations have reported major failures in adopting KM system. There is very few reference can be found especially for Indonesian corporations, to apply an effective KM that provides maximum benefits. The article examines the application of knowledge management system (KMS) in XYZ Co., a large IT service company, that serves major large corporations in Indonesia with the purpose to provide a reference of KMS application. The article adopts the successful KMS implementation based on the maturity level that was developed by Uday Kulkarni, Robert St. Louis, and Intel Corp. KMS maturity level has advantages in providing systematic thinking that commonly ignored by the Indonesian corporations. The KMS maturity model has been widely applied in major corporations and produced significant results. The article combines both KMS maturity model and 10-step KM roadmap developed by Armit Tiwana to maximize the output of KMS. The outcome of article is expected to be used as a reference for large corporation in Indonesia to apply KMS. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS","KM Maturity Model; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Management Maturity Level; Knowledge Management System",,,,,,"Tiwana, A., Williams, M., (2000) The Essential Guide to Knowledge Management:: E-Business and Crm Applications, , Prentice Hall PTR; Chigada, J., The role of knowledge management in enhancing organisational performance in selected banks of South Africa (2014) Information Science, , University of South Africa, Pretoria; Alavi, M., Leidner, D.E., Knowledge management and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Q, pp. 107-136; Foote, A., Halawi, L.A., Knowledge management models within information technology projects (2018) J.

In this research, we aim to create an artificial neural network model to choose a share to enter a portfolio based on its financial factors and big data about the financial condition of companies. The artificial neural network model has 15 input nodes of attributes associated with a company’s financial situation, 8 hidden layer nodes, and 1 output node. The accuracy of the model is 85.71%, with a learning rate of 0.05 trained over 2000 iterations. © 2020, The Author(s).","ANN; Big data; Neural network; Shares choice",,,,,"Binus University","This work is supported by BINUS University.","Ashwood, A.J., (2013) Portfolio Selection Using Artificial Intelligence, , DBA disertation of Queensland University of Technology; Fama, E.F., French, F.K., The cross-section of expected return (1992) J Financ, 47 (2), pp. 611-649; Farrell, J.L., Homogeneous stock grouping: implication for portfolio management (1975) Financ Anal J, 31 (3), pp. 50-62; Jones, C.P., (1992) Portfolio management, , McGraw-Hill’, New York; Khaksari, S., Kamath, R., Grieves, R., A new approach to determining optimum portfolio mix (1989) J Portf Manag, 15 (3), pp. 43-49; Manurung, A.H., (2002) Consistency of Shares Choice in Building Optimal Portfolio on Jakarta Stock Exchange by Fund Manager Associated to Ratio of Empirical Performance (Konsistensi Pemilihan Saham Dalam Pembentukan Portfolio Optimal Di BEJ Oleh Manajer Investasi Dikaitkan Dengan Variabel Rasio Empirik Kinerja Perusahaan), , Doctoral Disertation of University of Indonesia; Markowitz, H.M., Portfolio selection (1952) J Finance, 7 (1), pp. 77-95; Markowitz, H.M., Perold, A.F., Portfolio analysis with factors and scenarios (1981) J Financ, 36 (4), pp. 871-877; Marmer, H.S., Optimal international allocation under different economic environments: a Canadian perspective (1991) Financ Anal J, 3 (6), pp. 85-92; Peavy, J.W., Goodman, D.A., The significance of P/Es for portfolio returns (1983) J Portf Manag, 9 (2), pp. 43-47; Perritt, G.W., Lavine, A., (1990) Diversify: the investor’s guide to asset allocation strategies, , Longman Financial Services Publishing, USA; Rasekhschaffe, K.C., Jones, R.C., Machine Learning for Stock Selection (2019) Financ Anal J, 75 (3), pp. 70-88; Reily, F.K., Brown, K.C., (2002) Investment analysis and portfolio management, p. 272. , The Dryden Press, New York; Reinganum, M.C., The significance of market capitalization in portfolio management over time (1999) J Portf Manag., 25 (4), pp. 39-50; Saaty, T.L., Rogers, P.L., Pell, R., Portfolio selection through hierarchies (1980) J Portf Manag, 6 (3), pp. 16-21; Wainscott, C.B., The Stock-bond correlation and it’s implication for asset allocation (1990) Financ Anal J, 2 (2), pp. 55-60; Wallingford, B.A., A survey and comparison of portfolio selection models (1967) J Financ Quant Anal, 2 (2), pp. 85-106; Zhang, Y., Guo, Q., Wang, J., Big data analysis using neural networks (2017) Adv Eng Sci, 49, pp. 9-18","Budiharto, W.; School of Computer Science, Jl.

To support this concept, we designed an artificial neural network (ANN) using backpropagation, stochastic learning, and steepest gradient descent algorithms to determine teacher engagement based on the Indonesian Teacher Engagement Index (ITEI). The resulting ANN may be used in a data-gathering website for teachers to use for self-evaluation and self-intervention. The optimal architecture for the ANN has 44 input nodes, 26 first hidden layer nodes, 20 second hidden layer nodes, and 7 output nodes, with a learning rate of 0.05 and trained over 5000 iterations. The sample data used for training was gathered by ITEI researchers and the Executive Board of Indonesian Teachers Association (Pengurus Besar Persatuan Guru Republik Indonesia, PB-PGRI) and includes data of teachers from all around Indonesia. The maximum accuracy of this ANN was 97.98%. The sample data were then used to create an executive information system presented in the form of a map created using ArcGIS Pro software. © 2019 The Authors.

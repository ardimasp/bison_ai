The authorities are trying to protect the Indonesian banknotes from counterfeiting by embedding up to 12 security features on the banknotes.By its characteristic, the security features are divided into three, which are open, semi-open and closed. However, with so many security features, counterfeit currency on Indonesian banknotes still circulating because the counterfeiters can make a banknote that is very similiar to the original banknote. But, the counterfeiters pay less attention to the details of latent image security feature. Latent image is a semi-open security feature that must be viewed carefully to be able to recognize it.Although this feature can be printed and falsified, the quality of this feature on conterfeit banknotewas very bad. Based on this, original banknote and counterfeit banknote can be detected and classified according to the latent image security features.This research aims to develop a method for detecting the authenticity of banknotes using Deep Learning technology with the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. Outcome of the research can be used to develop an expert system for counterfeit banknotesdetection on Indonesian currency. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Many organizations has implemented a computer-based service at their business process. IT Infrastructure is used to support the computerized business process that means its need to be managed as services. Therefore, for giving more value for the IT Services, organization need to apply an IT Services Management (ITSM). In Indonesia, a lot of organization has implemented a framework that can manage the IT Infrastructure, namely IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL). This framework is a best practice for ITSM that mean ITIL is not a standard of ITSM but a best, good and common practice that was successfully implemented at a large number of the organization. Through this paper, the authors want to explain how the implementation of ITIL Framework in Indonesia and identify the impact of implementation of ITIL Framework at the organization that has implemented this framework in Indonesia. © 2017 IEEE.","IT Services; ITIL; ITSM","Business Process; Computer based services; Information technology infrastructure library (ITIL); It infrastructure libraries; IT infrastructures; IT services; ITIL; ITSM; Management science",,,,,"Brewster, E., Griffiths, R., Lawes, A., Sansbury, J., (2012) IT Service Management A Guide for ITIL Foundation Exam Candidates, , Swindon: BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT; Cartlidge, A., Rudd, C., Smith, M., Wigzel, P., Rance, S., Shaw, S., Wright, T., (2012) An Introductory Overview of ITIL, , London: Stationery Office; Prasetyo, A.A., (2016) Penerapan Service Request Management Dengan Pendekatan ITIL v3 Pada PT, , Gudang Garam Tbk.

The data was obtained using a survey via Google Forms in June 2018 and April–July 2020 in Indonesia. The analysis techniques were confirmatory factor analyses/CFA using LISREL and test of differences using JASP. The data could be used by the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Informatics (KEMENKOMINFO), Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture (KEMENDIKBUD), Indonesian Ministry of Youth and Sports (KEMENPORA), as well as social marketers to map the three constructs in Indonesian youth and to prevent the adverse effects and impacts of celebrity worship, digital illiteracy, and inappropriate mode of nostalgia. © 2020 The Author(s)","Celebrity; Construct validity; Digital literacy; Factor analysis; Indonesia; Nostalgic emotion; Psychology",,,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

This study aims at investigating the predictors of vulnerability to phishing and tailgating from the psychological perspective. The study was conducted on a sample of Indonesians (125 males, 137 females; Mage = 28 years old, SDage = 8.319 years); considered as the 'millennial' age group. Multiple linear regression analyses covering seven predictors of the vulnerabilities, i.e. insufficient knowledge/media literacy, excitement of victory, fear of authority, desire to be helpful, fear of loss, laziness, and appeal to ego, showed that the psychological models predicting vulnerability of experiencing phishing and tailgating were confirmed, with an effect size range between 18.5% to 19%. Media literacy alone was proven to be inadequate in managing/deterring the variables that embrace vulnerability to the two social engineering techniques. The relevance of this study to lifelong learning gravity is discussed throughout this article. © 2020 Birlesik Dunya Yenilik Arastirma ve Yayincilik Merkezi.

To give a theoretical basis for the efforts of preventing corruption that is thick with emotional nuance, this present study employs disruption to psychological contract, i.e. psychological contract breach (PCB), as a predictor of moral emotions proneness. The study involving 265 employees (169 males, 96 females; Mage = 32.32 years old; SDage = 7.28 years) of four big private banks in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, shows that PCB—with noting that, in this study, its scale operational scoring represents, reversely, the contract fulfillment—can predict Guilt-negative behavior evaluation (Guilt-NBE), Guilt-repair (Guilt-REP), and Shame-negative self-evaluation (Shame-NSE); all in negative directions, proved via simple linear regression analyses. Further analysis showed a more dynamic relationship between PCB and Guilt-NBE that fits to a cubic regression model. This study contributes to the axiological aspect of business psychology, especially in the ethical psychology of banking industry. © 2020 The Author(s)","Business psychology; Corruption; Guilt and shame; Moral emotion; Organizational psychology; Psychological contract; Psychology",,,,,"Binus University: 026/VR

The competition between e-commerce is done to attract many customers so that they are interested to buy. Therefore, e-commerce is using many strategies e.g. value creation brand (ambassador, image, and origin). The purpose of this research is to look at the effect of brand value creation (ambassador, image, and origin) on the purchase intention of e-commerce customers in Indonesia. There are 3 hypotheses stated at the beginning of the research and to prove the hypothesis, 412 questionnaires were distributed for this research. The questionnaires are analyzed with multiple regression using Smart-PLS 3. The results of this research showed that brand image and origin affect the purchase intention of e-commerce customers in Indonesia while brand ambassador does not affect. © IJSTR 2020.","Brand ambassador; Brand image; Brand origin; E-commerce; Purchase intention; Value; Value creation brand",,,,,,,,,"Ferdinand, (2002) Manajemen Pemasaran.

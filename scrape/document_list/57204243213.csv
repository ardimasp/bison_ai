The study specifically examines the important interrelationship between three variables that affect customer's intention to repurchase. The results facilitate the understanding of factors that influence repurchase intention of online shopping in Jakarta. One hundred valid responses from a set questionnaires were analysed. Regression analysis was employed to test the hypotheses. The results showed the customer's price perception and after-delivery satisfaction influenced their overall satisfaction and their intention to return to the same online shop (e-Tailer). In addition, overall satisfaction influenced repurchase intention at e-Tailer. Customer at-checkout satisfaction was not found to influence the overall satisfaction and their intention to return to shop at the same e-Tailer. The findings suggested that customers after checking-out from an e-Tailer required further favourable experiences to support their judgment and decision to return to the same online shop. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","After-delivery satisfaction; At-checkout satisfaction; Intention to return online; Overall satisfaction; Price perception",,,,,"Binus University","This research was supported by Bina Nusantara University.

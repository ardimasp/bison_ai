Furthermore, with the focused on development of powerful open source games development kit, namely Unity. This research will be called 'Bezier VFX Plug-in'. Using this plug-in, the author will implement the algorithm to improve the visual effect performance. As the number of the games developed by Indonesian developers are gradually increasing especially on these last few years, the quality is not looked as good as the quantity. For performance issues, Unity Particle Playground is an asset plug-in purchasable on the unity asset store. However, it does not solve the problem for the performance issue that developer encounter. As for this research, an entirely new solution is used to increase the game performance. A Bezier curve with extruded Mesh is used to replace the main use of Unity Shuriken Particle System. As the biggest particle visual effect gets replaced by the mesh implementation, the performance will be improved significantly. Overall, the end result is quite satisfying. Performance wise, it is improved a lot, the lag issues has been reduced. The usage of the plug-in is also straightforward; the only obstacle is the resources use is using sprite sheets. Subsequently this plug-in still can be improved. © 2016 IEEE.","bezier curve; performance; procedural mesh; unity","Interpolation; Bezier curve; Particle systems; performance; Performance issues; procedural mesh; Resources use; unity; Visual effects; Mesh generation",,,,,"Takahashi, D., (2015) U.S. Games Industry Forecast to Grow 30% to $19.6B by 2019, , http://venturebeat.com/2015/06/02/u-s-games-industry-forecast-togrow-30-to-19-6b-by-2019/, 2 June; Callewaert, C., (2016) Interviewee Unity Roadshow, , [Interview]. 25 March; (2016) Critical Playthings, , http://mycours.es/gamedesign2014/aaa-indie-diy-games/, [27 March; Bowen, L., (2014) American Psychological Association, , http://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/02/video-game.aspx, February, [28 March 2016]; Rouse, M., (2006) TechTarget, , http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/performance, April, [27 March 2016]; Dan Roth, M., (2016) University of Pennsylvania, , https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~milom/cis501-Fall08/lectures/02_performance.pdf, [27 March; Ward, J., (2008) Game Career Guide, , http://www.gamecareerguide.com/features/529/what_is_a_game_.php, 29 April, [27 March 2016]; (2015) Unity, Source 2, Unreal Engine 4, or CryENGINE - Which Game Engine Should i Choose?, , http://blog.digitaltutors.com/unity-udk-cryengine-game-engine-choose/, [28 March 2016]; Haas, J., (2016) Worcester Polytechnic Institute, , https://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-030614-143124/unrestricted/Haas_IQP_Final.pdf, 28 March; Meselson, M., (2016) Mesh, 3D, , http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6790/Mesh-3D.html, 28 March; (2016) Bezier Curves, , https://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/gfx/bezier.html, 29 March; Riskus, A., APPROXIMATION of A CUBIC BEZIER CURVE by CIRCULAR (2006) Information Technology and Control, 35 (4), p. 372; (2016) Math 149, , http://www.math.ucla.edu/~baker/149.1.02w/handouts/bb_bezier.pdf, 31 March; (2016) Computer Graphics Curves, , http://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_graphics/computer_graphics_curves.htm, 31 March; Studio, A., (2016) About Indonesia Game Industry Agate Studio, , http://www.slideshare.net/Clawford/about-indonesia-gameindustry-agate-studio, 31 March; (2013) Assassin's Creed 4 Game Director: 'We've Had over 900 People Work on This Game, , http://www.examiner.com/article/assassin-s-creed-4-game-director-weve-had-over-900-people-work-on-this-game, 15 October; (2013) Porter, ""envato Tuts, , http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/unity-now-youre-thinkingwith-components-gamedev-12492, 31 October, [5 July 2016]",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1st International Conference on Game, Game Art, and Gamification, ICGGAG 2016","19 December 2016 through 21 December 2016",,130961,,9781509054794,,,"English","Int.

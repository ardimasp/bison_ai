Using the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis, this study employs the bootstrap quantile estimates based on the annual data series covering the period of 1970–2018 to analyse the quantile effect factors affecting environment cleanness in Malaysia. The empirical estimates of this study reject the EKC hypothesis throughout the quantile levels, while the green taxation shows a negative sign which indicated government fiscal policies are reducing carbon emission in the upper quantiles. There is also homogeneity slope equality effect between total factor of productivity and green taxation on carbon emissions in the middle and upper quantile levels, while natural resources are indication heterogeneity effect on all quantile levels. From the policy point of view, if Malaysia wants to get environment cleanness, there is a need for comprehensive policies of total factor of productivity with environment innovation-friendly and technological improvement in all major economic sectors of the country. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emissions; Green taxation; Natural resources; Quantile regression; TFP","carbon emission; emission control; fiscal policy; government; hypothesis testing; Kuznets curve; natural resource; pollution tax; total factor productivity; Malaysia; carbon dioxide; economic development; Malaysia; natural resource; tax; Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Malaysia; Natural Resources; Taxes",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide",,"FRGS/1/2017/SS08/UTM/02/5","This research work was supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) funded by The Ministry of Education Malaysia (FRGS/1/2017/SS08/UTM/02/5).","Ahmed, K., Shahbaz, M., Qasim, A., Long, W., The linkages between deforestation, energy and growth for environmental degradation in Pakistan (2015) Ecol Indic, 49, pp. 95-103; Ali, W., Abdullah, A., Azam, M., The dynamic linkage between technological innovation and carbon dioxide emissions in Malaysia: an autoregressive distributed lagged bound approach (2006) Int J Energy Econ Policy, 6 (3), pp. 389-400; Amri, F., Carbon dioxide emissions, total factor productivity, ICT, trade, financial development, and energy consumption: testing environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis for Tunisia (2018) Environ Sci Pollut Res, 25, pp. 33691-33701; Amri, F., Zaied, Y.B., Lahouel, N.B., ICT, total factor of productivity, and carbon dioxide emissions in Tunisia (2019) Technol Forecast Soc Change, 146, pp. 212-217; Antonakakis, N., Chatziantoniou, I., Filis, G., Energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and economic growth: an ethical dilemma (2017) Renew Sust Energ Rev, 68 (1), pp. 808-824; Barış-Tüzemen, Ö., Tüzemen, S., Çelik, A.K., Does an N-shaped association exist between pollution and ICT in Turkey?

The authors specified quadratic and interactive models to be estimated by employing a quantile regression analysis. The traditional and quantile unit root test was used in testing the stationarity issue. The co-integration findings indicated that the capital account openness and financial development impede on real economic growth; and the political stability also had potential influence on the real economic growth of Kenya. Interestingly, there is a nonlinear U-shape link between financial development and real economic growth that undermined the real economic growth at its onset, but as it advanced, it enhanced the growth of the country in the long run. The policymakers should ensure that the capital account is more liberalised so that it will continue to stimulate the financial development. In the same way, the liberalisation of the domestic financial market should be taken in earnest to overcome the negative effects of financial repression in totality, while maintaining the stable political atmosphere. ©2020.","Financial liberalization; Political stability policy; Quantile estimates; Real economic growth; Resource policy; Trade openness","Finance; Economic growths; Financial development; Interactive models; Liberalisation; Political stability; Quantile regression; Time-series data; Unit root tests; Economics",,,,"4F980","Funding: This research received the Ministry of Higher Education Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) (Grant number 4F980).","Bhattacharyya, S.C., (2013) Electrification Experiences from Sub-Saharan Africa, , Springer: London, UK; Ibrahim, S., Financial Integration Growth Nexus: A quantile regression analysis (2016) J.

However, how digital (tech) startups as the initiator performs business model innovation that consciously or not disrupts incumbents from various industries, has not yet been widely analyzed empirically. This study employed a quantitative method with Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS 3 software to present and analyze the data. The sample of Indonesia digital startups was taken from the list managed by DailySocial, an Indonesia digital media startup. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed among the Founders and or C-Level of Indonesia startups adopting a random sampling technique. The findings of this study showed that startups apply disruptive business model innovation to survive and scale-up. This study also suggested some predictors of disruptive business model innovation. As an alternative to implementing dynamic capabilities, startups need to have transformation capability in the form of continuous reconfiguration capability; leadership aspects, especially entrepreneurship mentality, which are embodied in strategic orientation; and stakeholder management support. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Continuous reconfiguration capability; Disruptive business model innovation; Stakeholder management; Startups; Strategic orientation",,,,,"Binus University","We would like to express our gratitude to all parties who helped this study.

BRI is related to three of the five pillars contained in the GMF vision, namely maritime connectivity, maritime economy, and maritime culture. This article discusses Indonesia's perceptions and strategies in the BRI framework, and how Indonesia and China balance each other so that cooperation between the two countries impacts on economic growth and prosperity for Indonesia. Finally, for the Global Maritime Fulcrum-Belt and Road Initiatives (GMF-BRI) to synergize and achieve the vision set by the governments of China and Indonesia, mutual economic cooperation is needed. President Joko Widodo has demonstrated his leadership and ability to navigate Indonesia by implementing a hedging strategy with a sense of balance rather than joining in with China via bandwagoning. He showed his firmness in inviting foreign investors, especially from China, but he has strong principles in maintaining the sovereignty and dignity of this country. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","BRI; GMF; Indonesia; Joko Widodo; Strategy",,,,,,,"Adisasmita, H.R., (2013) Pembangunan Ekonomi Maritim, , Graha Ilmu; (2019), http://www.bin.go.id/internasional/detil/489/5/07/08/2019/era-baru-kebijakan-one-belt-one-road, Era Baru Kebijakan One Belt One Road; Cai, K.G., The One Belt One Road and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank: Beijing’s new strategy of geo-economics and geopolitics (2018) Journal of Contemporary China, 27 (114), pp. 831-847; (2020), https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/indonesia-china-natuna-islands-dispute-south-china-sea-12237456, Indonesia deploys four additional warships to Natuna amid standoff with Chinese vessel; (2019), http://en.brnn.com/n3/2019/0829/c415427-9610432.html, Indonesian Ambassador: BRI is open and inclusive; (2020), https://www.cnnindonesia.com/ekonomi/20200129203622-92-469956/salip-jepang-investasi-china-di-ri-naik-dobel-jadi-rp64-t, Salib Jepang Investasi China diri naik dobel jadi Rp 64/t; https://www.cnnindonesia.com/ekonomi/20200217185155-92-475473/virus-corona-belum-goyang-investasi-china-ke-indonesia, Virus Corona Belum Goyang Investasi China ke Indonesia; Dahuri, R., (2017) Menuju Indonesia Sebagai Poros Maritim Dunia, , Roda Bahari; Damuri, Y.R., (2014), https://www.csis.or.id/uploads/attachments/post/2019/01/10/a_maritime_silk_road_and_indonesia_s_perspective_of_maritime_state.pdf, A Maritime Silk Road and Indonesia’s Perspective of Maritime State.

It is essential for a company to make its employees satisfied and pleased with their jobs. These very satisfaction and pleasure are hoped to serve as a key for motivating employees to perform and contribute their best for the company. Numerous research studies have proven the positive effect of work well-being on job performance, but the findings came with inconsistencies and controversies. This fact has caused reluctance in a good many companies to invest in their employees’ work well-being. A survey of 509 millennial employees in the Indonesian startup digital industry was conducted in this research. The results show that employee’s work well-being had a significant, positive effect on job performance. Theoretically, this research has contributed in responding to inconsistencies in literature. It is hoped that this research will also offer practical contribution to individual employees as well as human resources department and increase company executives’ confidence in making organization-related strategic decisions to attain sustainable performance. Finally, we propose a number of intervention suggestions for performance improvement through work well-being. © 2020 by the authors;","Industrial Revolution; Job Performance; Millennial; Sustainable Performance; Work Well-being",,,,,,,"Albuquerque, A.S., Troccoli, B.T., Development a measure of subjective well-being (2004) Psicologia, 20, pp. 153-164; Amelia, A., (2018) Employer Branding: When HR Is the New Marketing, , Jakarta, Indonesia: Penerbit Buku Kompas; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review of recommended two step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 411-423; (2012) Creating People Advantage: Mastering HR Challenges in A Two Speed World, , BCG; Bouckenooghe, D., Raja, U., Butt, A.N., Combined effect of positive and negative affectivity and job satisfaction on job performance and turnover intentions (2013) Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied, 147 (2), pp. 105-123; Campbell, J.P., Modeling the performance prediction problem in industrial and organizational psychology (1990) Handbook of Industrial and Organizational Psychology, pp. 687-732. , Dalam M.

So far, Indonesia's maritime economic potential has not been optimally developed, especially in Natuna. The area of Natuna Sea is 99.25%, so it is very potential to develop marine tourism. Natuna is also included in the planning of the Global Maritime Fulcrum and is given the authority to manage tourism. Natuna Geopark has also been inaugurated by UNESCO in 2019. The presence of a geopark in Natuna will have an impact on the movement of foreign tourists. Thus, it is necessary to prepare human resources for tour guides to welcome foreign tourists. This study describes the design of Natuna Tourism application with an emphasis on mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) to introduce Natuna tourism in Indonesian, English and Mandarin. Through this application, students can learn independently. This application also features pictures and sounds with a quiz that helps learners to memorize vocabulary. Before designing this application, researchers first conducted interviews with the Natuna tourism service and religious high schools. From the interviews, the application was designed using the Mnemonic method. Researchers hope that with applications on smartphones that can be used offline, the Natuna tourism agency will develop and can contribute to improving the maritime economyfishermen, fish processing technology and illegal fishing. Whereas the obstacle in the field of goods distribution is the Sea Toll Program which is of little help due to the trip schedules of ships which are only twice a month. The fishermen's catch has become no longer fresh and cannot be sold at high prices. There should be special treatment for Natuna by developing a model of economic integration of Maritime and tourism. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

The views that arise are views that come from various backgrounds of shareholder members and property stakeholders who are in the circle of residential property supply chain, including property owners and everyone who becomes working and in touch with the property business itself. The data obtained from qualitative and quantitative research give a lot of understanding and input to see the role of CSR and the relation of the performance of property company organization in Indonesia which is generally incorporated in Real Estate Indonesia membership (REI). Property firms provide data representing owners and supply chain properties with careful observation of the company’s CSR activities. The fundamental findings found by the researcher is the existence of adequate understanding level of CSR, and still the scarcity of CSR program organizing in the property company that researched causing CSR in the property industry has not got big impact when compared with CSR done in other industries such as mine, oil and gas. In the future, the contribution of CSR is expected to be greater and more effective and have an impact in building the property especially the housing that can be reached by the wider community including informal sector along with the financing scheme which is not convoluted and can fulfill the backlog of public housing which is getting bigger from year to year. © 2019 IJSTR.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Housing; Informal sector; Organizational performance; Property; Shareholder; Stakeholder; Supply chain",,,,,,,"Pérez, A., Del Rodríguez Bosque, I., Salazar, J., Husted, B.W., Biehl, M., (2012) Measuring CSR Image: Three Studies to Develop and to Validate a Reliable Measurement Tool., , Journal citation; Salazar, J., Husted, B.W., Biehl, M., (2012) Thoughts on the Evaluation of Corporate Social Performance Through Projects., , Journal citation; Drucker, P.F., (2001) Management Challenges for the 21st Century, , Harper Business, New York, USA.

The harsh competition among English course providers and the existence of national plus and international schools have become challenges for the courses to attract students. We use both qualitative and quantitative methods to uncover and respond to the problems faced by this industry. We did interviews with some managers and utilized questionnaires of 61 English courses in DKI Jakarta. Using SMART-PLS (Partial Least Square), we found that the essential entrepreneurial factors of leadership, mindset and entrepreneurial culture as a whole were capable of generating and developing innovations within the English courses, which led to competitive advantages. However, we found an interesting fact that entrepreneurial culture had no direct significant effect on innovations. The novelty of this study is to contribute a new finding that the three elements of strategic entrepreneurship contributed differently to innovation in the context of emerging economies. © 2019 IJSTR.","English courses in DKI jakarta; Entrepreneurial culture; Entrepreneurial leadership; Entrepreneurial mindset; Innovation",,,,,,,"Al Mazrouei, H., Pech, R.J., The expatriate as company leader in the UAE: Cultural adaptation (2015) Journal of Business Strategy, 36 (1), pp. 33-40; Caesar, L.A.Y., Performance excellence by transformational leadership in developing collectivistic culture for Indonesian companies (2016) Pertanika J.

We analyzed over s even significant publishers with a total of 126 keywords to find the most suitable publisher s and the best keywords for our research. After determining the keyword and publisher, we analyzed 101 records of journal articles in Taylor and Francis publisher. We analyze all the aspects, including meta data for each record, topic of research, object of research, and we also added consideration of ICT aspect inclusion in each record. Our findings suggest th at: (1) there are more research in Africa and Europe comp ared to the rest of the world; (2) corruption prevention effort mentioning ICT has increased 4.5 times in the time period of 2016 2018 compared to 2013 2015; (3) there are more research focusing in practicability and less in basic research in the time peri od of 2016 2018 compared to 2013 2015.

Using monthly-based time series data, which set over the period of 1996-2017, we adopt the bootstrap quantile regression model to provide a comprehensive relationship of international tourism demand theory in Malaysia. The empirical results show that sales tax has a negative relationship with international inbound tourism demand, mainly at the middle quantile stages. Moreover, we also found that price competition from Thailand has a positive influence on Malaysia’s tourism demand; and appreciation of Indonesia’s exchange rate competitiveness tends to lead Malaysia’s tourism demand. These empirical findings open up new insights for policymakers in Malaysia as to how to improve fiscal policies and enhance continual increase of international inbound tourism demand in the upcoming years. © 2019, Centre of Sociological Research.

In current modern society, information technology exists as a multidisciplinary tool to solve lingering problems that could not be solved by traditional efforts. This paper aims to provide knowledge regarding identified efforts to fight corruption specifically in Indonesia region. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology is used as the methodology, and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow is used as framework to identify relevant records. Scopus database is used as data source. A total of 10 records are labelled as relevant to this research, and the findings are synthesized. It was found from the records that the main areas of interest for ICT research for corruption prevention in Indonesia are (1) information transparency, (2) operational enhancement, (3) success evaluation, (4) security and fraud, and (4) decision support. The findings are expected to assist future research in term of providing valuable insights on corruption prevention using ICT in Indonesia. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In most university, management must be able to collect all hundreds of proposals and reports; not to mention they must be able to accommodate the process of reviewing every single proposal. They also need to monitor all research output in final report and make sure that all of the outputs are correctly achieved from proposed target. In addition to the problems stated, previous activities are done manually, leaving a lot of opportunity to improve and automate the process. All of the addressable opportunity for improvement are explained and explored, thus a model of the web application is created. This paper presents the design of web application used to solve persistent problem in research management, specifically in Binus University. The design methodology is divided into two phases: requirement engineering phase, and system design. Upon finishing the requirement engineering phase, system model is depicted using Unified Modeling Language, specifically: Activity Diagram, Use Case Diagram, and Conceptual Class Diagram. © 2018 IEEE.","higher education; research management system; unified modeling language","Information management; Systems analysis; Telecommunication services; Unified Modeling Language; Design Methodology; Design of web applications; Higher education; Requirement engineering; Research activities; Research management; Research management systems; Research outputs; Design",,,,,,"Braddock, R., Neave, G., Research management in higher education: Overview and conclusion of a debate (2002) Higher Education Policy, 15 (3), pp. 313-330; Shon, H.S., Han, S.H., Kim, K.A., Cha, E.J., Ryu, K.H., Proposal reviewer recommendation system based on big data for a national research management institute (2017) Journal of Information Science, 43 (2), pp. 147-158; Lu, R., (2016) University Teaching and Research and Scientific Research Performance Quantitative Statistics System; Morgan, A., Duffield, N., Walkley Hall, L., Research data management support: Sharing our experiences (2017) Journal of the Australian Library and Information Association, 66 (3), pp. 299-305; Liu, Y., Yao, Y., Zhang, X., Liu, B., Ding, C., Design of research management system based on workflow and rapid development platform technology (2015) Estimation, Detection and Information Fusion (ICEDIF), 2015 International Conference on, pp. 329-334. , IEEE, January; Morales, M.P.E., Abulon, E.L.R., Ermita, R.C., David, A.P., Organizing and systematizing knowledge management through an automated university-based research Portal (2017) Asia Pacific Journal of Multidisciplinary Research, 5, p. 3; Pressman, R.S., Software engineering-A practitioners approach (2015) Mc Graw-Hill International Edition, 2010; Matthias, R., Tools & Techniques Expert Opinion, Online, , http://www.idemployee.id.tue.nl/g.w.m.rauterberg/lecturenotes/UFTexp.ertopinion.pdf; Rumbaugh, J., Booch, G., Jacobson, I., (2017) The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual, , Addison Wesley; Dumas, M., Ter Hofstede, A.H., UML activity diagrams as a workflow specification language (2001) International Conference on the Unified Modeling Language, pp. 76-90. , Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, October; Jena, A.K., Swain, S.K., Mohapatra, D.P., A novel approach for test case generation from UML activity diagram (2014) Issues and Challenges in Intelligent Computing Techniques (ICICT), 2014 International Conference on, pp. 621-629. , IEEE, February; Ikram, M.T., Butt, N.A., Hussain, A., Nadeem, A., Testing from uml design using activity diagram: A comparison of techniques (2015) International Journal of Computer Applications, 131, p. 5; Seidl, M., Scholz, M., Huemer, C., Kappel, G., The use case diagram (2015) UML@ Classroom, pp. 23-47. , Springer, Cham",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2018","3 September 2018 through 5 September 2018",,142373,,9781538658215,,,"English","Proc.

To imagine the severances of it, 10.000 KM of highway can be built with that much amount of fund. Several responses has been done by Indonesian government to fight corruption from both prevention and persecution. This work focuses on the development of a web application aimed to provide insight to corruption case per province in Indonesia. The web application was developed using Machine Learning, specifically Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Web crawling and web scraping techniques are used to gather news content from 7 major news portal in Indonesia. Accuracy is measured by comparing correct prediction by ANN to its true value. Upon finding corruption news, data is saved and further analysis is done to establish the number of corruption news per region. Finally, the output is visualized using Google Map API. The purpose of this work is to provide regional depiction of corruption case to give further insight to be used by decision makers. Upon using this web application, objectivity of program development is expected to increase. The final output of the web application is a map of corruption case in Indonesia per region. The accuracy of ANN used in this work to classify corruption and non-corruption news is 96.91 % using Sigmoid Activation Function. © 2018 IEEE.","corruption mapping; corruption prevention; machine learning; web application","Application programs; Backpropagation; Decision making; E-learning; Information management; Learning systems; Mapping; Neural networks; Web crawler; Back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN); corruption prevention; Decision makers; Google map api; Program development; Sigmoid activation function; WEB application; Web scrapings; Crime",,,,"Binus University: 024/KM/PNT/2018","This work is supported by Directorate General of Research and Development Strengthening, Indonesian Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, as a part of National Strategic Institutional Research Grant to Binus University titled “Pengembangan Sistem Pemetaan Kasus Korupsi Berdasarkan Indeks Persepsi Korupsi Dengan Menggunakan Teknik Text Mining” or “The Development of Corruption Case Mapping Based on Corruption Perception Index using Text Mining” with contract number: 024/KM/PNT/2018 and contract date: 6 March 2018.","Pradiptyo, R., Partohap, T.H., Pramashavira, Korupsi Struktural; Analisis Database Korupsi Versi 4 (2001-2015), , http://cegahkorupsi.feb.ugm.ac.id/publikasi-/Database%20Korupsi%20V%204-5April16_RP_VR_THP.pdf, 5 April 2016[Accessed September 2016]; Rose-Ackerman, S., Palifka, B.J., (2016) Corruption and Government: Causes, Consequences, and Reform, 2nd Ed., Cambridge: Cambridge, , University Press; Jain, A.K., Corruption: A review (2001) Journal of Economic Surveys, 15 (1), pp. 71-122; Sommer, U., Bloom, P.B.-N., Arikan, G., Does faith limit immorality? the politics of religion and corruption (2013) Democratization, 20 (2), pp. 287-309; Madsen, F.G., Corruption: A global common evil (2013) The RUSI Journal, 158 (2), pp. 26-38; International, T., Slow, Imperfect Progress Across Asia Pacific, "" 21 February 2018, , https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/slow_imperfect_progress_across_asia_pacific, [Accessed 21 May 2018]; Olken, B.A., Pande, R., (2011) Corruption in developing countries Scholars at HARVARD; International, G., (2018) Corruption Continues to Plague Indonesia, , http://news.gallup.com/poll/157073/corruptioncontinues-plague-indonesia.aspx, [Accessed 21 May 2018]; Henderson, J.V., Kuncoro, A., Corruption in Indonesia (2004) National Bureau of Economic Research, pp. 1-38; Indonesia Corruption Watch Survei Nasional Anti Korupsi, , https://antikorupsi.org/sites/default/files/files/Kajian/Temuan%20Hasil%20Survey%20Anti%20Korupsi%202017.pdf, 26 July 2017.

The ideal textbook for the subject can boost learning and student competence and achievement in mastering the language. The selection of textbooks has not taken into consideration the background and motivation of students, learning objectives, frequency and length of study and student expectations. This paper discusses the need for a textbook to be used by IR majors in Indonesia. The data collection is populated through the distribution of questionnaires to eight universities that hold Chinese language classes for IR majors. The study concludes that the students expected a textbook to contain appropriate and applicable formal and informal language acquisition materials related to IR. The study looks at the cultural knowledge of the destination, lessons on the writing of Chinese characters and grammar exercises. Regarding the order of topics for learning Chinese by IR students, the students perceived that the right order would be: greetings, self-introduction, letters and numbers, time, names of days and months, daily activities, transportation, public facilities, directions and instructions, professions, international relations, politics and economy. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Chinese language; Foreign language; International relations; Textbook",,,,,"Sumitomo Foundation","support of this research from the research project “Need Analysis on East Asia Text Book Writing for Teaching the Japanese and Chinese Language as a Second Language for International Relations University Students in Indonesia: An Integrated Approach” funded by the Sumitomo Foundation.","Ali, M., (2014) Memahami Riset Perilaku Dan Sosial [Understanding Behavioral and Social Research], , Jakarta: PT.

Two things presented in this paper are how the policy of the New Southbound Policy affects the education of Indonesia's young generation, and how is the collaboration of colleges and Industries in Vocational Training. This study uses library method and interviews with 260 students who follow the program lectures and internship for four years in Taiwan. They are spread across the industry of contact lens, plywood, electronics, software, steel mills, chemical plants, hotels, and resorts. Also, interviews are conducted to the foundation that bridges this program. This research concludes that colleges, industry, and students feel the significant benefits of collaborative programs between industry and academia.

The development of cross-border tourism is in line with Jokowi-Jusuf Kalla‘s nine priorities. However, the obstacle in tourism is human resources who fluently speak foreign languages in marketing and communicating with foreign tourists, especially in the border area. Since Natuna is far and difficult to reach, no Natuna‘s university educates their human resources to speak a foreign language and because Natuna is also lack of foreign teacher. Therefore, it needs a breakthrough in foreign language learning through mobile learning applications. As smartphones are commonly used in society, the solution of foreign language learning through smartphone application became an innovation in education and training. The research method was Focus Group Discussion (FGD) between officials of Natuna‘s Regional Planning, Research, and Development Agency. The FGD was done by showing the design of interactive mobile applications for foreign language learning, especially English and Mandarin. The design of this application has been demonstrated in the FGD activities and has received a positive response. The conclusion of this research is Mobile Learning application is a foreign language learning solution to support tourism activities in Natuna. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Cross-border tourism; M-learning application; Natuna","E-learning; Regional planning; Smartphones; Teaching; Cross-border; Foreign language learning; Human resources development; Innovation in educations; Interactive mobile applications; M-Learning; Natuna; Smart-phone applications; Computer aided instruction",,,,,,"Kabupaten, P.D., Kondisi Geografis Kabupaten Natuna, , https://natunakab.go.id/kondisi-geografis-kabupaten-natuna/, Natuna.

However, study related to the implementation that benefits directly to the society is needed. This study examines how to create a sustainable city by enhancing social capital from both macro and micro analyses. This combination of analysis offers deeper understanding both from decision makers at city level and individuals, groups and society. We will conduct qualitative approach mainly by interviews and direct observation to collect the data. also, we also analyze publicly available data. Finally, this study contributes to new understanding in creating a sustainable city, not only about the environment and physical aspects, but also about ensuring political economic, democratic values, and social welfare. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Decision making; Decision makers; Direct observations; Economic empowerment; Physical aspects; Political participations; Qualitative approach; Social capitals; Sustainable cities; Sustainable development",,,,,,"Wu, Fullong, Urban Poverty and Marginalization under Market Transition: The Case of Chinese Cities (2004) International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 282; Finke, Barbara, Civil society participation in EU governance (2007) Published by Connecting Excellence on European Governance (CONNEX) and New Modes of Governance (NEWGOV); Claridge, T., (2007) Dimensions of Social Capital Theory, , http://www.socialcapitalresearch.com/literature/theory/dimensions.html; Onyx, J., Bullen, P., (2001) The Different Faces of Social Capital in NSW Australia, pp. 45-58. , http://www.socialcapitalresearch.com/literature/theory/dimensions.html, Social Capital and Participation in Everyday Life, edited by Eric M.

Three distinct yet intertwine aspects such as decentralization, technology, and para diplomacy become antecedent of competitiveness of the city. A city has more power and authority in creating wealth and prosperity of the society by utilizing technology. The smart city, in addition to the importance of technology as enabler, we argue that possessing the sophisticated technology and apply it towards the matter is not enough. The smart city needs to build smart diplomacy at the sub-national level. In this article, we extend the discussion about smart city by proposing a new framework of smart city diplomacy as one way to integrate information technology, public policy and international relations which will be the main contribution to literature and practice. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Public policy; Competitiveness of the cities; International relations; National level; Smart city",,,,,"The authors gratefully acknowledge that the present research is supported by Ministry of Research and Technology and Higher Education Republic of Indonesia under the research grant of Hibah Kompetensi 2017.","Nobuyuki, T., (2016) The Smart City and the Co-creation of Value, , (Japan: Springer); Albino, V., Berardi, U., Dangelico, R.M., Smart cities: Definitions, dimensions, performance, and initiatives (2015) Journal of Urban Technology, 22 (1), pp. 3-21; Mukti, A.T., (2013) Paradiplomacy: Kerjasama Luar Negeri Oleh Pemda di Indonesia, , (Yogyakarta: The Phinisi Press); Detlef, F.S., Yael, W., (2004) Eds.

There is also a global push to consider environmental factors and the sustainable development. The successful implementation of CSR activities of PT. Riau Andalan Pulp and Paper (RAPP) in Riau, Indonesia, is an example of a program based on business and ethical values. This case produced successful models for the CSR-based social enterprise. The hypothesis here is that the success of a social enterprise is due in part to underlying moral philosophy, such as how ideological entrepreneurship is implemented based on ideological, personal and local values.

As China's investment in Indonesia expands in various industry sectors, the need for qualified translators escalates. However, the situation described that Indonesia lacks competent and qualified translators in Mandarin. The study adopts the qualitative approach. Technically, the study utilizes a variety of secondary data consisting of documents, books, publications, and website to collect data based on the needs of qualified translators and how to improve their competency. In addition, primary data collection involves industry and translation service providers, from high schools, vocational schools, colleges, and Chinese language courses through interviews. In this respect, the study contributes to the development of the Mandarin Chinese translator competency through professional translator training programs. The competencies developed include Mandarin language skills in a variety of contexts or themes such as business, industry, accounting, taxation, law, and socio-political issues. The findings of this research indicate the significance to complement the lack of knowledge and skills that are not acquired during the college. Importantly, the authors propose a professional interpreter training model to meet the demand of Chinese investors in Indonesia eventually. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data acquisition; Economics; Personnel training; Professional aspects; Program translators; Taxation; Teaching; Chinese investors; Economic relations; Industry sectors; Qualitative approach; Socio-political issues; Training program; Translation services; Vocational schools; Translation (languages)",,,,"Kementerian Riset, Teknologi dan Pendidikan Tinggi","We acknowledge the partial financial support of this research from research project “Strategi Pengembangan Daerah Perbatasan di Kepulauan Riau dalam Rangka Implementasi Indonesia sebagai Poros Maritim Dunia by Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia.","Justin, Y.L., Demystifying the Chinese Economy (2013) The Australian Economic Review, 46 (3), pp. 259-268; Eichengreen, B., Donghyun, P., Kwanho, S., When Fast-Growing Economies Slow Down: International Evidence and Implications for China (2012) Asian Economic Papers, 11 (1), pp. 42-86; Xiaoxi, Z., Kevin, D., The determinants of China's outward foreign direct investment (2011) Emerging Markets Review, 12 (4), pp. 389-398; Cheng-Chwee, K., Multilateralism in China's ASEAN policy: Its evolution, characteristics, and aspiration (2005) Contemporary Southeast Asia, 27 (1), pp. 102-122; http://www.rappler.com/indonesia/ekonomi/158819-5-mega-proyek-investasi-china-indonesia; http://www.bareksa.com/id/text/2015/07/27/investor-china-mulai-kucurkan-dana-bangun-smelter-us410-juta/11009/newsd; Anne, L., Translation Skills and Knowledge - Preliminary Findings of a Survey of Translators and Revisers Working at Inter-governmental Organizations (2012) Meta, 57 (1), pp. 108-113; María, D.L.T., A web-based resource to improve translation skills (1999) ReCALL, 11, pp. 41-49; Mohamed, A.M.A., Assessing Aptitude and Attitude Development in a Translation Skills Course (2012) CALICO Journal, 29, pp. 321-340; Mansoor-Ul-H, H., Ahmad, A., Purpose of dictionary use in professional education: A study of dictionary using habits in medical students (2010) Procedia Social and Behavioural Sciences, 2 (2), pp. 3988-3993; Mustafa, A.B., Behcet, C., Naci, Y., International Journal of Social Sciences & Educational Studies (2014) Smart Phone Assisted Language Learning, 1, pp. 67-71; Chinnery, G.M., Going to the MALL: Mobile assisted language learning (2006) Language Learning &technology, 10, pp. 9-16; Robert, G.J., Emerging Technology Mobile Apps for Language Learning (2011) Language Learning & Technology, 15, pp. 2-11",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","4th International Conference on Friendly City 2017","11 October 2017 through 12 October 2017",,135340,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Indonesia, as one of the trade partners of China, should increase the quality and quantity of cooperation with China. In supporting the goal, it requires an ample of human resources ability that is active in socialization, diplomacy, and cooperation establishment with China. The cooperation can be established by mastering of Mandarin. The Department of International Relations realized the situation and complemented its students with foreign language skill such as Mandarin. Based on the evaluation of Chinese learning outcomes to 31 sophomore students, the biggest obstacle of students is to compose a sentence based on vocabularies learned. Researchers designed mobile learning as a tool in learning Mandarin. Therefore, this research offers solutions to assist students in mastering the sentences forming in Mandarin through mobile learning. © 2017 IEEE.","evaluation; language; Mandarin; mobile learning","Commerce; Data communication systems; E-learning; evaluation; Foreign language; International relations; language; Learning outcome; Mandarin; Mobile Learning; Third-world countries; Students",,,,,,"Mursitama, T.N., Yudono, M., Panjaitan, A., (2013) Dinamika Diplomasi Ekonomi di Asia, , Jakarta: Kepik Ungu; Godfrey, C., The influence of Chinese culture on learning Chinese as a second language: A case study of Zimbabwean students learning Chinese as a second language (2015) International Journal of Language and Linguistics, 3 (2), pp. 33-39; Pearson, L., (2014) The Foundations of Teaching Chinese As A Foreign Language: An Investigation of Late 19th Century Textbooks, , http://scholarworks.umass.edu/theses/1076, Masters Theses 1896-February; Ying, Y., Mursitama, T.N., Illuminative approach in evaluation of curriculum of Chinese literature department (2017) Adv.

Regarding the context of humor in the political setting, humor can be used as a means of increasing morale and hope for individuals who feel discontent with the current political climate. Poking fun at politics has become even more widespread with the help of the Internet, which provides a medium in which different varieties of political humor are more easily accessible to the public. This study investigates the role of political humor appreciation types in predicting political dogmatism. The predictive-correlational design was conducted on 128 university students (67 males, 61 females; Mean of Age = 22.27 years old; Standard Deviation of Age = 3.33 years) in Greater Jakarta, Indonesia, recruited through convenience sampling technique. Multiple linear regression results showed that appreciation of the benign humor type has an inverse predictive relationship with political dogmatism. In contrast, appreciation of the subversive and undermining humor types can predict dogmatism in positive directions. Appreciation of the supportive humor type does not play a role in the dynamic of political dogmatism. The practical implication of this study is that the strategic use of each type of political humor needs to be carefully arranged so as not to be counterproductive. © Common Ground Research Networks, Kharisma Murti, Tommy Prayoga, Juneman Abraham, Tirta Nugraha Mursitama, All Rights Reserved.","Appreciation; Dogmatism; Political Humor",,,,,,,"Abraham, J., Pane, M.M., The mediating role of social competition identity management strategy in the predictive relationship between susceptibility to social influence, internet privacy concern, and online political efficacy (2014) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8407, pp. 492-499. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-55032-4_50; Abraham, J., Prayoga, T., Takwin, B., Political psychology of Indonesian political figure: A case study of a political entrepreneur who is not hesitant in paving a new way (2018) International Journal of Research Studies in Psychology, 7 (1), pp. 35-58. , https://doi.org/10.5861/ijrsp.2018.1863; Afrianty, D., (2016) Islam and Politics: Indonesia'S Identity Crisis, , http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/11/islam-politics-indonesia-identity-crisis-161121082414557.html, Aljazeera, November 22; Antawirya, A., (2013) Interview with The Corruptor, , https://ahmadantawirya.wordpress.com/2013/03/07/218/; Applegate, M., Cohen, J., Communicating graphically: Mimesis, visual language, and commodification as culture (2017) Cultural Politics, 13 (1), pp. 81-100. , https://doi.org/10.1215/17432197-3755204; Aritonang, M.S., Sapiie, M.A., Heriyanto, D., #Jenderalkardus vs. #Jenderalbaper: Twitterati mock prabowo, SBY in upset fallout (2018) The Jakarta Post, , http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/08/09/jenderalkardus-vs-jenderalbaper-twitterati-mock-prabowo-sby-in-upset-fallout.html, August 9; (2018) “'Apa Urusan Anda Menanyakan Itu' Dan Hal Lain Soal Wawancara Edy Rahmayadi” ['What Your Business Is About by Asking That' and Other Things About The Interview with Edy Rahmayadi], , https://www.bbc.com/indonesia/trensosial-45637696, BBC Indonesia; Bippus, A., Factors predicting the perceived effectiveness of politicians' use of humor during a debate (2007) Humor-International Journal of Humor Research, 20 (2), pp. 105-121. , https://doi.org/10.1515/HUMOR.2007.006; CAMEO Fun Campaign: Jokowi Presiden (2014) YouTube Video, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vi5l7h_YQx4; Fun Campaign: Prabowo Jokowi (2014) YouTube Video, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hITLHh0flPoandt=348s, -; Colom, G.G., Alcover, C.T., Sánchez-Curto, C., Zárate-Osuna, J., Study of the effect of positive humor as a variable that reduces stress: Relationship of humor with personality and performance variables (2011) Psychology in Spain, 15 (1), pp. 9-21; Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T., (2004) Introduction to Political Psychology, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Damanik, C., (2018) “Kronologi Kasus Meiliana Yang Dipenjara Karena Keluhkan Pengeras Suara Azan” [The Chronology of Case of Meiliana Who Was Imprisoned for Complaining Azan Loudspeakers], , https://regional.kompas.com/read/2018/08/23/15053451/kronologi-kasus-meiliana-yang-dipenjara-karena-keluhkan-pengeras-suara-azan, Kompas, August 23; Dewberry, D.R., Fox, R., Easy as 1, 2, 3: Rick Perry and self-deprecation as image restoration (2012) Journal of Contemporary Rhetoric, 2 (1), pp. 1-10; Ebbighausen, R., Indonesia is on the brink of disaster (2017) Deutsche Welle, , http://www.dw.com/en/indonesia-is-on-the-brink-of-disaster/a-37528124; Fadhil, H., PPP-NasDem-PSI nilai prabowo 'the winter soldier' cuma ikut-ikutan” [PPP-NasDem-PSI judged the prabowo's 'the winter soldier' to be just a conforming expression] (2018) DetikNews, , https://news.detik.com/berita/4261734/ppp-nasdem-psi-nilai-prabowo-the-winter-soldier-cuma-ikut-ikutan, October 18; Ferguson, M.A., Ford, T.E., Disparagement humor: A theoretical and empirical review of psychoanalytic, superiority, and social identity theories (2008) Humor: International Journal of Humor Research, 21 (3), pp. 283-312. , https://doi.org/10.1515/humor.2008.014; Ford, T.E., Ferguson, M.A., Social consequences of disparagement humor: A prejudiced norm theory (2004) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 8 (1), pp. 79-94. , https://doi.org/10.1207/S15327957PSPR0801_4; (2017) “Ternyata Raja Salman Dukung Ahok” [It Turned Out That King Salman Supported Ahok], , https://twitter.com/gerilyapolitik/status/836874963110014977, GerilyaPolitik. @GerilyaPolitik; Gibbons, S., How to include politics in your marketing without turning anyone off (2017) Entrepreneur, , https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/292018, March 28; Gross, R., (2010) Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behavior, , 6th ed.

We employed the Threshold Error Correction (TECM) cointegration and the nonlinear causality estimates to capture the nexus between real energy prices and financial stability for the GCC countries’ tourism demand in Malaysia using the monthly-based dataset covering the period since 1995 till 2017. The main TECM estimate shows that real energy price fluctuations and financial instability condition in Malaysia positively boost tourists’ arrivals from the GCC countries to Malaysia. Indeed, there is evidence of an asymmetric speed of adjustment of the GCC countries’ tourism demand with 25.9% and 36.7% of positive and negative deviations, respectively. In addition, this study found a strong evidence of unidirectional nonlinear causal relations running from real energy prices to tourism demands; and also bidirectional causalities running from tourism demand to financial stability. These findings will be helpful for tourism policy makers in Malaysia while drawing a future roadmap to increase the numbers of the GCC tourists’ arrivals in future years. © 2018, Centre of Sociological Research.

We covered the 5 major sources of Middle East tourism to Malaysia in the last 2 decades, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran, Syria and the United Arab Emirates. The estimates of the quantile regression reveal that the global oil price fluctuation has affected the Middle East tourist arrivals to Malaysia. First, we found that there is a positive quantile effect of tourism, domestic tourism prices and global oil prices with Middle East tourism demand in Malaysia throughout the estimated quantiles. Secondly, we could not find any specific influence of exchange rate and this shows that the fluctuating Malaysia’s currency is not a major issue for the Middle East tourists. Overall, this finding can be useful for policymakers while improving their future tourism planning and in attracting more tourists to visit Malaysia in the upcoming years. © Foundation of International Studies, 2018 and CSR.","Domestic tourism prices; Middle east; Oil prices; Quantile regression; Real exchange rate",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","This paper has been successfully presented at the International Conference on Empirical Economics & Social Sciences (ICEESS), 27-28th June 2018 in Bandirma, Turkey, and this research was funded under the Research Acculturation Grant Scheme (RAGS), Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia (Vote.

The authors conclude that not all subjects can be done in virtual or ‘off class.’ The conversation class, reading and grammar should be done face to face because students need the guidance of a lecturer to correct the error tone and pronunciation when communicating and reading as well as in composing a sentence that is related to Chinese grammar.

Some prior discussions successfully addressed material imperatives as the most important empirical findings in Africa. However, the manner in which China's Foreign development assistance policy to Southeast Asian countries is conducted remains a matter that receives less attention. This study discusses this matter by analytically discussing the fourfold conception of power posited by Barnett and Duvall. This study suggests that China successfully conducts its compulsory, structural and productive power in some specific development assistance as a form of maintaining social relation with Southeast Asian countries. However, there is no empirical evidence showing that China is institutionally successful in dealing with them. This study is conducted by also showing how interactions in the specific development assistance field occur between Beijing and its Southeast Asian counterparts that in turn exemplify the essential use of power. © Medwell Journals, 2016.","China; Development assistance; Power; Social relations; Southeast Asia",,,,,,,"Acharya, A., (2001) Constructing a Security Community in Southeast Asia: ASEAN and the Problem of Regional Order, pp. 174-175. , Routledge, London, New York; Acharya, A., Do norms and identity matter?

One of the challenges faced by big companies working in renewable industry is to assure that every of its supply chain truly comply with the principles of environment protection. It underlines the transformation of CSR practices particularly community development since the establishment to the position which the company has been growing rapidly. As most companies in emerging economy context especially emphasize only for maximizing profits as business reason, this company shows different direction by also practicing community development programs in quite massive ways and producing better impact to the society. Through in-depth case study, this study argues that the company has been successfully created organizational trajectory to support their CSR practices since their establishment up to 2008. This research contributes in some ways as follows. First, by analyzing path-trajectory of CSR practices, it will enrich an understanding on how a big company as part of its global network develops its CSR practices, particularly in emerging economies context. Second, it provides the clearer evidences, milestones and challenges of the importance of creating so-called CSR practices reflected local needs where the company exists. Third, in the end, it proposes further inquiry whether the company should continue make, buy or decide to collaborate in future CSR practices while the growth of its activities becomes mature and or changed rapidly. © 2014 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Community development; Corporate social responsibility; CSR trajectory; Indonesian company; Pulp and paper industry",,,,,,,"Abreu, R., David, F., Crowther, D., Corporate social responsibility in Portugal: empirical evidence of corporate behaviour (2005) Corporate Governance, 5, pp. 3-18; Branco, M.C., Rodrigues, L.L., Corporate social responsibility and resource-based perspectives (2006) J.

Using qualitative method, this research used mainly in-depth interview in collecting primary and secondary data and infornation from relevant agencies. This study found that each actors of foreign policy decision making has competing one over another as they pursue their own interests. Therefore, the tern coordnation among related domestic actors is an expensive, yet costly activity As it is veIy impodant, it should be encouraged to smoothen Indonesia's foreign policy making.

The results show the importance of how institutional factors such as government policy change and technological change influence the development of potential absorptive capacity especially acquisition capabilities.

Based on the relational view, this research investigates whether value created by business groups depends upon sharing, combining, and exchanging unique and specific resources or assets among affiliated firms. Results show that technological capabilities contribute to create relational rents in terms of affiliated firms' investment in R&D and human capital. Managerial capabilities also contributed to generating relational rents through investment in managerial knowledge acquisition for affiliated firms without R&D units and in training for affiliated firms with R&D units. However, learning by exporting and learning from imported input do not yield relational rents within business groups. Overall, these findings reveal that business groups as interorganizational networks are contingent on their internal, unique, and specific capabilities, as social capital theory argues. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.","Business groups; Capabilities; Indonesian firms; Relational rents",,,,,"National University of Singapore, NUS","I gratefully acknowledge constructive comments from Shigeru Asaba, Michio Nitta, Keisuke Nakamura, Junji Nakagawa, Hiroyoshi Kano, Ishtiaq Mahmood, Andrew Delios, Mike Peng, Michael Carney, Alvaro Cuervo-Cazurra, Sea Jin Chang, Yuri Sato, Thee Kian Wie and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

As an emerging non thermal technology, cold plasma could be used to give a pretreatment to a thermal-sensitive material, such as pretreatment to seeds of bell pepper prior to be planted in soil to understand the effect of this dry process during the germination period. In this experiment, the used argon plasma was generated by flowing argon gas with the rate of 2 L/min through a positively charged of stainless pipe at a distance of 15 mm from aluminum plate electrode. With an applied voltage of 9.8 kV (peak-to-peak) electrical energy from a high voltage AC power supply, argon plasma irradiation was employed to the bell pepper seeds for a predetermined period of time as pretreatment to the seeds during pre-planting. It was found that the temperature of the plasma never exceeded 35°C during the plasma irradiation to assure that no thermal damage occurred to the seeds. It was also confirmed from this study that by giving non thermal plasma treatment for 30 minutes to the seeds may enhance the germination of the bell pepper plants up to 90% in stem length and almost 2.5 times in root length compared to the pepper without treatment. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","agriculture; green bell pepper; Non-thermal plasma; seed germination","Agriculture; Argon; Bells; Cultivation; Electric power systems; Irradiation; Plasma applications; Shotcreting; Argon plasma treatment; Bell peppers; Non-thermal plasma treatment; Non-thermal technology; Nonthermal plasma; Plasma irradiations; Seed germination; Thermal sensitive material; Seed",,,,,,"Lu, P., Cullen, P.J., Ostrikov, K., (2016) Cold Plasma in Food and Agriculture Fundamentals and Applications, pp. 83-116; Weizong, W., Danhua, M., Xin, T., Annemie, B., Gliding arc plasma for CO2 conversion: Better insights by a combined experimental and modelling approach (2017) Chemical Engineering Journal, 330, pp. 11-25; Zhang, S., Rousseau, A., Dufour, T., Promoting lentil germination and stem growth by plasma activated tap water, demineralized water and liquid fertilizer (2017) RSC Advances, 7 (50), pp. 31244-31251; Vlasta, S., Pavel, S., Jakub, K., Jan, P., Milan, S., Monika, S., Jana, J., Mirko, C., Atmospheric pressure plasma treatment of agricultural seeds of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) with effect on reduction of diseases and germination improvement (2017) Plasma Processes and Polymers, 15 (2); Je-Wook, K., Pradeep, P., Chulkyoon, M., Effect of corona discharge plasma jet on surface-borne microorganisms and sprouting of broccoli seeds (2016) Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 97 (1), pp. 128-134; Khanit, M., Non-thermal plasma for germination enhancement of radish seeds (2016) Procedia Computer Science, 86, pp. 132-135; Florian, J., Stephane, S., Christophe, B., Thierry, D., Plasma-activation of tap water using DBD for agronomy applications: Identification and quantification of long lifetime chemical species and production/consumption mechanisms (2018) Water Research, 133, pp. 47-59; Samarah, N.H., Wang, H., Welbaum, G.E., Pepper (Capsicum annuum) seed germination and vigour following nanochitin, chitosan or hydropriming treatments (2016) Seed Science and Technology, 44 (3), pp. 609-615; Waranyoo, K., Phirayot, K., Ponlawat, U., Improved germination and vigour of sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.)

A homemade flyback transformer was utilized to power up this gas-phase plasma system and its electrical characteristics were presented in the form of voltage amperage waveforms. UV/Vis analysis was employed to monitor the influence of plasma treatment time on the decreasing of MB concentration as well as to measure the decoloration efficiency. It was found that the decoloration efficiency of MB solution can reach 93% after 120 minutes of plasma treatment to result in transparent water. Furthermore, FTIR analysis was performed to recognize the differences in MB organic functional groups before and after plasma treatment and to confirm the mineralization process that was occurred during plasma irradiation. During plasma irradiation, the interaction between hydroxyl radicals and other various reactive species transforms the organic pollutants into the harmless sediments through complex chemistry reactions. Due to all of the plasma treatments were carried out without the addition even a single chemical; it can be conclude that nonthermal plasma system may potentially become one of the competitive environmentally friendly techniques in destruction and decoloration of an organic polluted solution such as textile wastewater. © RASĀYAN.

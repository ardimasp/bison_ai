Living in an ever-evolving world, people and technology have become inseparable. One technology that is on the rise is Augmented Reality (AR), which combines the real world with virtual or computer-generated data. This research is based on developing a combination of jigsaw puzzles with AR (multiple marker-based) called Puzzlar, using FLARManager as an AR tool. The application also uses Adobe Flash (game design) and PHP. The uniqueness of the prototype program is in its use of 2D physical markers to represent 3D jigsaw puzzle pieces that are animated in the playing mode. In user acceptance testing (UAT), 70% of the testers were satisfied with the game play of Puzzlar. However, 30% of the testers thought that it could be improved. © 2006-2014 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","3D puzzle; Augmented reality; Game; Jigsaw puzzle; Puzzlar",,,,,,"Finch, C., The Benefits of Jigsaw Puzzles: Jigsaws Can Educate, Stretch the Mind&Make a Great Gift.

Accrual quality is assessed using the abnormal accrual model and Dechow and Dichev (DD) model; earnings persistence and predictability are assessed through net income autoregressive model. Using 103 Indonesian non-finance IPO firms, this research concludes that earnings quality of IPO firms changed along with the alteration of their status from private to public firms. Post-IPO (after becoming public firms), the sample shows a higher quality of earnings in terms of accrual quality and earnings persistence increases after IPO. However, this research could not reject the hypothesis of decreasing post-IPO earnings predictability due to the nature of IPO firms.

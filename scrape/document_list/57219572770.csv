For the Thousand Islands area, educational facilities are quite adequate, but the problem is that if you want to continue your education at the upper secondary level, students must stay on Pramuka Island, and incur additional costs. With the development of information systems and technology, making the industrial era 4.0 grow rapidly, so that and bring changes to the education sector with e-learning terminology that can provide solutions for regions in Indonesia that are still constrained in problems of access and distance so it is necessary to know the level of teacher readiness and students in schools in the Pramuka Island environment in the Thousand Islands in utilizing electronic learning. Quantitative research approaches are used and data collection uses a questionnaire with a likert scale with a population of all teachers and all school students who are on Pramuka Island, Thousand Islands. The research method uses the factor analysis method and the regression analysis method is used to build the model. The results showed the existence of ease of use e-learning application systems, rapid response from information technology support, and e-learning application systems that are easy to do if there is a change in learning material. © 2020 IEEE.","A thousand islands; E-learning implementation; Learning process; Student readiness level; Teacher readiness level","Computer aided instruction; Economic and social effects; Education computing; Engineering education; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Learning systems; Population statistics; Students; e-Learning application; Factor analysis method; Industrial revolutions; Information and Communication Technologies; Information systems and technologies; Information technology support; Quantitative research; Regression analysis methods; E-learning",,,,"Binus University","The author would like to thank BINUS University, Indonesia and the Community Service Internal Grant Program in 2020 which has funded the implementation of e-learning in schools in the Pramuka Island environment of the Thousand Islands - DKI Jakarta by building the initial prototype of this research","Luis Sánchez Garciá, J., Pérez Ruiz, S., Development of capabilities from the innovation of the perspective of poverty and disability (2017) Journal of Innovation & Knowledge, 2 (2), pp. 74-86. , May-August; Sardjono, W., Retnowardhani, A., Astari, Analysis of quality factors go-jek mobile application to increase company competitive advantage (2019) International Conference on Information Management and Technology (ICIMTech); Hussein, Z., Leading to intention: The role of attitude in relation to technology acceptance model in e-learning (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 105, pp. 159-164; Wu, R., Wu, Z., Wen, J., Cai, Y., Li, Y., Extrinsic and intrinsicmotivations as predictors of bicycle sharing usage intention: An empirical study for tianjin, China (2019) Journal of Cleaner Production, 225, pp. 451-458. , 10 July 2019; Vlastimir, N., Dalibor, P., Nebojša, D., Miloš, M., Snežana, G., Appraisal and review of e-learning and ICT systems in teaching process (2019) Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 5131, pp. 456-464. , January 2019; Ruth, W., Shirazi, S., A systematic review of audience response systems for teaching and learning in higher education: The student experience (2020) Computers & Education, 153; Schuster, L., Glavas, C., Exploring the dimensions of electronic work integrated learning (ewil) (2017) Educational Research Review, 21, pp. 55-66; Helen, C., Matthew, B., Greene, J.A., Psychological foundations of emerging technologies for teaching and learning in higher education (2020) Current Opinion in Psychology, 36, pp. 101-105; Hamidi, H., Chavoshi, A., Analysis of the essential factors for the adoption of mobile learning in higher education: A case study of students of the university of technology (2018) Telematics and Informatics, 35 (4), pp. 1053-1070. , July 2018; Sardjono, W., Readiness model of knowledge management systems implementation at the higher education (2020) ICIC Express Letters ICIC International, 14 (5), pp. 477-487. , May 2020",,,"BINUS University;IEEE Indonesia Section","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","5th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2020","13 August 2020 through 14 August 2020",,163671,,9781728170718,,,"English","Proc.

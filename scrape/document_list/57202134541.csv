There were sixteen university lecturers involved in this study. Data were collected through an online survey using Google form. The analysis of data used descriptive analysis using percentages. The results indicate that Online Learning Interaction carried out in English classrooms resulted in positive effects for university lecturers. The most influential effect of executing Online Learning Interaction to facilitate lessons in English was aiding to enhance technological skills in learning. Then, the second biggest effect was facilitating to transformation global vision or mindset of the lecturers. The third and fourth places were improving the effectiveness of communication in learning and enhance delivering skills. Moreover, the study indicates that ICT satisfaction in learning was the dominant motive to execute Online Learning Interaction in English Classroom contexts. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Physics; Analysis of data; Descriptive analysis; Global vision; Influential effects; Online learning; Online surveys; Technological skills; E-learning",,,,,,"Gallini, J.K., Barron, D., Participants' perceptions of web-infused environments: A survey of teaching beliefs, learning approaches, and communication (2002) Journal of Research on Technology in Education, 34 (2), pp. 139-156; Palloff, R.M., Pratt, K., (1999) Building Learning Communities in Cyberspace: Effective Strategies for the Online Classroom; Crystal, D., (2003) English As A Global Language; Chong, C.S., (2018) Ten Trends and Innovations in English Language Teaching for 2018, , https://www.britishcouncil.org/voices-magazine/, British Council Voice Magazine, England, June 11 [viewed 20 Oct 2019, verified 2 Nov 2019 at https://www.britishcouncil.org/voices-magazine/ten-trends-innovations-english-language-teaching-2018.doc]; Deacon, A., Paxton, M., Carr, T., Creating a project-based learning environment for commerce courses by customizing an Office suite (2000) Proc., Conference on Information Technology in Tertiary Education (CITTE), , http://www.upe.ac.za/citte2000/, University of Port Elizabeth, South Africa, March [viewed 2 Oct 2019, verified 5 Oct 2019 at http://www.upe.ac.za/citte2000/docs/adeacon.doc]; Cronje, M., (2001) The 3rd Annual Conference on World Wide Web Applications; Grabe, W., Stoller, F.L., (2002) Teaching and Researching Reading; Pourhossein Gilakjani, A., Sabouri, N.B., Advantages of using computer in teaching English pronunciation (2017) International Journal of Research in English Education (IJREE), 2, pp. 78-85; Valdez, G., McNabb, M., Foertsch, M., Anderson, M., Hawkes, M., Raack, L., (2000) Computer-based Technology and Learning: Evolving Uses and Expectations; Belsky, L., (2019) Where Online Learning Goes Next Harvard Business Review, , https://hbr.org/2019/10/, Canada.

The technology development has challenged how education was brought to learners. The traditional way may no longer fit the demand. This research aimed to investigate the critical success factors in blended learning for English Training. Systematic literature review was established to reach the conclusion. 30 journal articles published in 2013 to 2017 were examined to gain the results and findings. The result showed there were 11 key success factors in delivering the English training by blended learning. The most critical factors were the course design of blended learning, the instructional model of blended learning, and the teaching learning method in the blended learning course. It was suggested in the future to emphasize the research on the various designs of blended learning, the tools for the online sessions, and the suitable teaching learning method in the blended learning course. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Enterprise resource planning; Learning systems; Teaching; Blended learning; Critical factors; Critical success factor; Instructional model; Key success factors; Systematic literature review; Teaching-learning method; Technology development; Curricula",,,,"Binus University","This research paper was funded by the research grant from Bina Nusantara University.","Luke, J.Y., Putri, M.R., Sela, S.T., The expectation of faculty on english language skills study through online learning (2017) Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Information and Education Technology Unpublished Paper; Jokinen, P., Mikkonen, (2013) Nurse Education in Practice, 13 (6), pp. 524-528; Precel, K., Alkalai, Y.E., Alberton, Y., (2009) International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, 10 (2), pp. 1-16; Al-Qahtani, A., Higgins, S.E., (2013) Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 29 (3), pp. 220-234; Gedik, N., Kiraz, E., Ozden, M.Y., (2013) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 29 (1), pp. 1-19; Banditvilai, C., (2016) The Electronic Journal of E-Learning, 14, pp. 220-229; Kitchenham, B., (2004) Technical Report, , (Keele University); Kitchenham, B., (2009) Information and Software Technology, 51 (1), pp. 7-15",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","1st International Conference on Advance and Scientific Innovation, ICASI 2018","23 April 2018 through 24 April 2018",,148653,17426588,,,,"English","J.

On the other hand, in higher education level the students should produce a thesis to complete their study. Facilitating the students to be ready for the thesis writing, English for Academic Writing course was delivered to the students. Research-based teaching method was implemented in the course in order to help the students improved their writing skills as well as the critical thinking skills. The purpose of this research was to investigate the impact of the research-based teaching method toward the students' critical thinking skills in writing. Case study was implemented to reach the conclusion. Fifty (50) Global Class students majoring in Information System were observed to gain the result. Questionnaire result was used to support the observation data. The result showed there was improvement in students' critical thinking in academic writing after joining the class. Further, the result also found the method may help the students sharpen their 21st Century skills such as collaboration and communication. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

Mobile technology is also used in various aspects of life, one of which is education. LMS is an educational application in the form of an online portal that facilitates learning activities. LMS has been widely used by several universities in Indonesia because of its benefits in improving the effectiveness of learning and student learning performance which has been proven by several studies. Therefore, Bina Nusantara University (Binus) has decided to develop a mobile-based LMS in December 2018. However, in the first year of launching this application, there were some known problems from the preliminary questionnaire and review from the Play Store and App Store. Therefore, in this study, researchers will identify experiences and aspects that are demanded by students by using the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) along with other questions that will be processed into evaluations and suggestions for improvement for Binus Mobile for Student. © 2019 SERSC.","Binus Mobile for Student; Learning Management System; User Experience; User Experience Questionnaire; User Study",,,,,,"Leopold, T., Stefanova, V., Zahidi, R., (2018) The Future of Jobs Report 2018,”, , in Geneva: World Economic Forum; Sakamoto, S.G., de Miranda, L.C., M4REMAIP: Method for Requirements Elicitation Based on Mobile Applications under an Interaction Perspective (2014) International Conference of Design, User Experience, and Usability, pp. 74-85; Naismith, L., Sharples, M., Vavoula, G., Lonsdale, P., (2004) Literature Review in Mobile Technologies and Learning; Sampson, D.G., Zervas, P., Mobile learning management systems in higher education (2012) Virtual Learning Environments: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools and Applications, pp. 1249-1264. , IGI Global; Bohang, F.K., Berapa jumlah pengguna internet indonesia Kompas, , https//tekno.kompas.com/read/2018/02/22/16453177/berapa-jumlah-pengguna-internet-indonesia; Asiri, M.J.S., Others, “Factors influencing the use of learning management system in Saudi Arabian higher education: A theoretical framework (2012) High.

One of them is how a contract is made. Smart contract technology has offered a new, efficient, and secure way to automatically execute the terms of the agreement with no third-party to perform such contracts. The objective of this paper is to conduct a systematic overview of how the smart contract can bring opportunities and also challenges to Indonesia. We propose this paper due to the benefits Indonesian businesses will have by implementing smart contracts. Apart from the benefits, in Indonesia, there are still very few journals discussing smart contracts implementation. In this paper, there will be our findings of how smart contracts are utilized currently in industries, the challenges, and the current smart contract in Indonesia. The result will be used as guidance when considering, planning, and applicating smart contracts in Indonesia. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

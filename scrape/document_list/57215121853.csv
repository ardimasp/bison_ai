In general, students need to improve their soft skills in the areas of self-management, teamwork, communication, initiative and entrepreneurship, problem solving decision-making, planning and organization, etc. With these soft skills, students are expected to have more added value when studying in higher education. This qualitative paper discusses business processes and also user interface for application in higher education institutions to attract more students to participate in activities held by faculty committee or student activity units. With this research, students can be more interesting in terms of gamification in the form of obtaining an e-badge if it has reached a level in the soft skills of the higher education institution. © 2019 IEEE.","higher education; smart campus; smart e-badge; student achievement; student activity","Decision making; Human resource management; User interfaces; Added values; Business Process; E badges; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Self management; smart campus; Student achievement; Students",,,,,"Sunley, R., Harding, L., Jones, J., Realising creativity in management education: Putting student energy into action (2019) Int.

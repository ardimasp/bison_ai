NMF can reduce the dimension of highly dimensional data such as multimedia data. In many researches, NMF can also be used as classification technique which is done by utilizing the extracted feature from NMF process. So far, NMF and its variation such as LNMF has been used to classify human facial expression. Unfortunately, for high dimensional data such as human faces, those methods are computationally expensive. This paper mainly discuss about the human facial expression recognition technique using 2DNMF. This research is done by implementing 2DNMF for facial expression recognition and comparing its result to that of NMF and LNMF. From the experimental result, it can be concluded that 2DNMF can be used for human facial expression recognition with better accuracy and much efficient time. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","2DNMF; Face expression recognition",,,,,,"Li, S.Z., Hou, X.W., Zhang, H., Learning spatially localized, parts-based representation (2001) Int.

Some researches showed us the using of NMF coefficient in classification though some of them did their research using bilinear space projection. This research is conducted by simulating face expression recognition to the two available approaches and then comparing the accuracy and time efficiency aspect of the two methods. Through this research, it can be concluded that the use of NMF coefficient results in better accuracy compared to bilinear space projection, but bilinear space projection has better time efficiency. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Bilinear space; Face expression recognition; Nmf",,,,,,"Li, S.Z., Hou, X.W., Zhang, H.J., Learning spatially localized, parts-based representation (2001) Int.

Nowadays, viewers are not passive anymore. This proposal focuses on dynamic painting, and active audiences. Magic Asian Art allows viewers to enjoy dynamic Asian painting, and furthermore, each audience recreates the same painting according to their personal preference or the impression of a painting. It is quite similar that conductor conducts an orchestra for the same music differently. We extract viewer's intension based on the emotional status or impression of the painting by using gaze tracker and the painting will be more dynamic and fun. Magic Asian Art is neither movies by cinematographer, nor video games by an algorithm, but novel interactive painting media by each user.","Animation; Gaze tracking; Interactive painting; Nonphotorealistic rendering","Gaze tracker; Gaze tracking; Non-Photorealistic Rendering; ON dynamics; Personal preferences; Video game; Animation; Human engineering; Painting",,,,,"Edmonds, E., Turner, G., Candy, L., Approaches to interactive art systems (2004) Proceedings of GRAPHITE, 2004, pp. 113-117; Hershman, L., Art-ficial sub-versions, interaction, and the new reality, in: Camerawork (1993) A Journal of Photographic Arts, 20, pp. 20-25; Way, D.-L., Hsu, C.-W., Chiu, H.-Y., Shih, Z.-C., The synthesis of rock textures in chinese landscape painting (2001) Computer Graphics Forum, 20, pp. C123-C131; Yeh, J.-W., Ouhyoung, M., Non-photorealistic rendering in chinese painting of animals (2002) Journal of System Simulation, 14 (6), pp. 1220-1224; Oh, C.S., Hee Nam, Y., GPU-based 3D oriental color-ink rendering (2005) The 15 th ICAT 2005, pp. 143-148. , Christchurch, New Zealand Dec. 5-8; (2005) MXRToolkit, , http://sourceforge.net/projects/mxrtoolkit","Park, E.; Interaction and Entertainment Research Center, 50 Nanyang Drive, Singapore 637553, Singapore; email: pek@vr.kaist.ac.kr",,"Assoc.

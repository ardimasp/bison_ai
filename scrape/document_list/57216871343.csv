XYZ to determine the level of risk of prospective customers. One of the main objectives of PT. XYZ is to achieve customer satisfaction by issuing insurance policies to prospective customers with a clean data profile according to Underwriting more quickly. The research will be carried out by implementing the Support vector machine (SVM) algorithm using the kernel, Random Forest and Naive Bayes. Determination of the best model will be evaluated using Model Evaluation like confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, and Recall of the developed model. This research will release the design and the impacting of machine learning to current business processes and systems and how to deploy and integrated the model with existing systems at PT.

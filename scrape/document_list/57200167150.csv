The most used communication technologies today is the smartphone, which is a mobile phone with the ability of a portable computer. Currently, to communicate each other, people feel more convenience using chat application in a smartphone than calling or short message services (SMS) features. Some of the advantages of chat application are there is no message size limitations, highest number of consumers use it; especially younger demographics,and it also works on mobile web without application download. Due to the convenience of communication using chat apps increases, the security demands are also higher, i.e., a proper cryptography scheme is needed to protect the messages. In this paper, we implement ECC algorithm to secure text message in messaging application of a smartphone. We will adopt the method proposed by Singh1 to create a chat application in Android program that equipped end-to-end encryption. We also give the experimental result of our chat apps performance such as the accuracy of the received text message, average encryption and decryption time. © 2018 The Authors.

FPPD usually deals with using one cover image to hide any data. To make it practical, a steganography method needs to accommodate concatenated data of different types of media. The steganography method should also allow large data to be distributed on multiple cover images. Therefore, there should be indicator for the start, end, and media type of each component of secret data. The purpose of this research is to develop a FPPD based distributed steganography which allow addition of multiple secret message components across multiple cover images while informing the recipient of the media type of each secret message. This is done by applying a modulus function to to adjust the values of a block to represent the start, end, continuation, and media type of secret messages. The proposed approach results in PSNR value of 37.62, below the benchmark FPPD method. This decrease in PSNR is the result of modification to the pixel value of the reference point to provide means to embed data of different media types into several images. © 2017 The Authors.

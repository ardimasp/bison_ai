Supporting data to study these technical factors need to be obtained so that it can be improved throughout the year as a skipjack fishing standard with weights taken by the skipjack weights. Therefore, drones and underwater drones with cameras with high-resolution video and images to be fed and processed by computer vision. These drones are operated via Huhate ships which are then used to test efficient technical factors as expected, can be used in determining the size, shape, and colour as well as the analysis of skipjack fish that are in the Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs or Rumpon) in order to manage the management of fisheries managed in Indonesia. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Drone; Fisheries management; FishNet; Huhate; Machine Learning","Computer vision; Drones; Fish; Fisheries; Fishing (oil wells); Learning systems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Fish aggregating devices; Fisheries management; FishNet; High resolution; Huhate; Katsuwonus pelamis; Oceanographic conditions; Technical factors; Deep learning",,,,"12/AKM/PNT/2019, 225/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019, 039/VR","Authors wishing to acknowledge the support from the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of PenelitianUnggulanPerguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled ―PerancanganAlgoritmaUntukPengenalan Ikan Cakalang, Tonkgol dan LemadangOtomatis Hasil TangkapanNelayan Huhate Di Bitung, Manado‖ or ―Design An Algorithm for Automatic Skipjack, Tongkol, and Lemadang Recognition of Fishermen Using Huhate in Bitung, Manado‖ with contract number: 225/SP2H/LT/DRPM/2019, 12/AKM/PNT/2019, 039/VR.RTT/IV/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","Medley, P., Ahusan, M., Dan Adam, M.S., (2017) Bayesian CPUE Standardisation Model for Madived Pole and Line Skipjack Tuna, , http://www.iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2017/10/IOTC-2017-WPTT19-INFO1_SKJ_Bayesian_PL_CPUE.pdf; (2017) Laporan Kinerja 2017, p. 12. , Anonim; Sutrisno, M., Sompie, Janny, Study of technical aspects of pole and line fishing catching unit at Bitung Oceanic Fishing Port (2017) Jurnal Ilmu Dan Teknologi Perikanan Tangkap, 2, pp. 223-230; Diniah, M.A., Yahya Pujiyati, S., Parwinia Effendy, S., Hatta, M., Sabri, M., Rusyadi, Farhan, A., (2001) Makalah Falsafah Sains.

Education is important in creating superior national seeds. An important component in education problems that are often found in the evaluation system in the thesis process at the university often occurs data manipulation. The research aims to design the idea of applying Blockchain-Based Technology to the thesis discussion system at universities. Forum Group Discussion (FGD) is used to collect data related to business processes in the thesis assessment from beginning to end. The literature review is used as a means to support the theories or hypotheses proposed in this study. Therefore, this research proposes to give the idea of designing a system. Assessing the thesis uses Blockchain-Based Technology to eliminate cheating in practice and can also increase the potential in the world of education so that it can move forward in this era. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

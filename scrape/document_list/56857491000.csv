Employing the machine learning technique of artificial neural network (ANNs) to develop a prediction model with fewer experiments and tests is a gentle solution to forecast the properties of the spot weld structures. In this study, the extended full factorial design with respect to thetool speed, plunge depth, anddwell time are applied to the FSSW specimens of aluminium A5052-H122 of 2mm thick through 27 experiments and evaluated via tensile shearing load testing. The multilayer neural network of feed-forward and back-propagation (FFBP) algorithm was engaged to learn and train the neural network iteratively with a set of weights and bias of 27 variations of inputs to fit the predicted tensile shear loads of the spot weld structures. Based on the resulted of regression plot, it is shown that the correlation coefficient (R) is perfect for training with the value of 0.999 and for testing the correlation coefficient (R) is reached to 0.958. However, the correlation coefficient is relatively good for validation with R equal to 0.921. For all data sets, the correlation coefficient is good with R of 0.833. It can be seen that the ANNs prediction model is relatively good since the correlation coefficient relatively close to 1. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","aluminium alloy; artificial neural network;

The significant issue in FSSW is the existence of porosity or wormholes, leads to welding failure. One reason is due to imperfect heat generation leads to temperature distribution during FSSW effect to uncertain weldment formation. This is mainly influenced by improper parameters selection. In this study, the temperature distribution in the weld zones is investigated using finite element analysis via computer numerical simulation of Altair Hyperworks software with respect to parameters i.e. spindle speed, tool plunge depth, and tool dwell time. In the simulation, tool plunge depth and tool dwell time is set constant, but spindle speed was varied from 1400, 1500, and 1600 rpm respectively. Based on the results found that at a spindle speed of 1400 rpm was produced max temperature in the weld zone at 540 °C. Meanwhile, at 1500 rpm increased the temperature at 596 °C. At 1600 rpm reached its highest temperature at 650 °C. The results show that increasing tool rotational speed, at a constant tool plunge depth and constant tool dwell time will increase the amount of temperature distribution in the weld-zones. It is concluded that the suitable temperature distribution required in FSSW is 540 °C represented the solid-state joining process provided by spindle speed of 1400 rpm. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","aluminium alloy; finite element analysis; Friction stir spot welding","Aluminum alloys; Computer software; Friction; Friction stir welding; Speed; Spot welding; Temperature distribution; Welds; Friction stir spot welding; Highest temperature; Hyperworks software; Parameters selection; Rotational speed; Solid-state joining; Solid-state welding; Spindle speed; Finite element method",,,,"Binus University: 033/VR, RTT/IV/2019","The authors would like to acknowledge for financial support from Bina Nusantara University through Hibah Terapan BINUS in 2019 with the contract no.: 033/VR.RTT/IV/2019, for funding this research activity.

In this study, a machine learning technique i.e. support vector machine (SVM) was applied to develop a load level prediction system of friction stir spot welded joint aluminium alloy AA5052-H112. This load level prediction system model was proposed based on three levels of load group of the welded joint. Experimental works in friction stir spot welding was conducted on samples specimens of AA5052-H112 2mm thick overlap joint based on 27 combinations of governed parameters i.e. spindle speed, tool depth, and dwell time. Mechanical testing of tensile shear load was then carried out to those specimens to obtain 27 loads data to form the SVM classifier. These data were required for pattern classification and model development via training and testing the proposed prediction system. The result obtained via training and testing showed the classification of load data produced by the proposed system, matched to the required load level with the 100%. This study proved that the proposed load level prediction system offered a useful tool to predict the load level of friction stir welded joint aluminium alloy AA5052-H112 by using respected parameters without required experiments and tests. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The required heat energy is generated in such away by mechanical friction between rotating, traveling tool and workpieces itself. In this work the study which focused on the heat generation in FSW is done by using Finite Element Analysis software i.e. Altair HyperWorks. The generated and distributed heat across the workpieces of a 6mm thick Aluminium alloy 6061 during FSW is observed in this study. The objective of this study is to characterisize of the heat generation during FSW with respect to the welding parameters i.e. rotational and travel speed of the tool. In the analysis, a three dimensional symmetrical model was used to predict the generated and distributed heat by using the finite element method. Heat analysis and measurement during welding is carried out numerically and experimentally for validation. From the analysis and measurement is concluded that the maximum temperature gradients in longitudinal and lateral directions are located just beyond the shoulder edge. It can be seen that the heat flux is higher for higher tool rotation than the lower tool rotation. Both are set at constant travel speed. The maximum heat is proportional to the rotational speed. It is occured due to high frictional forces between the rotating tool and workpiece and increasing the heat generation around the tool. This study provided better insight about generated and distributed heat during FSW as a result of process parameters which can be used as reference to produced good quality of welding with less experiment. © 2018 Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Malaysia.","Finite Element Method; Friction stir welding",,,,,"Ministry of Education, MOE: ERGS/1/2013/TK01/UITM/03/03","The research team wishes to thank to the Ministry of Education Malaysia under the grant numbers ERGS/1/2013/TK01/UITM/03/03 for the financial support and the Research Management Institute (RMI) of UiTM for the management assistant.","Zhu, X.K., Chao, Y.J., ""Numerical simulations of transient temperature and residual stresses in friction stir welding of 304Lstainless steel"" (2004) Journal of Materials Processing Technology"", 146, pp. 263-272; Colegrove, P., Painter, M., Graham, D., Miller, T., ""Three dimensional flow and thermal modeling of the friction stir welding process"" (2000) Proceedings of the Second International Symposium on Friction Stir Welding, , Gothenburg, Sweden; Vijayan, S., Raju, R., ""Process Parameter Optimization and Characterization of Friction Stir Welding of Aluminum Alloys,"" (2008) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 3 (10), pp. 1303-1316; Ulysse, P., ""Three dimensional modeling of friction stir welding process"" (2002) International Journal of Machine Tools & Manufacture, 42, pp. 1549-1557; Defalco, J., An introduction to friction stir welding (2009), TheFabricator, September 15; Mijajlovic, M., Mathematical Model for Analytical Estimation of Generated Heat During Friction Stir Welding (2011) Journal of Balkan Tribological Association, 17 (2), pp. 179-191; Nandan, R., DebRoy, T., Bhadeshia, H.K.D.H., Recent advances in friction-stir welding Process, weldment structure and properties.

In this work, a machine learning technique i.e. support vector machine (SVM) is applied to develop a system model for prediction the mechanical property in friction stir welding (FSW) of a 6mm thick AA6061 welded joint. Experimental works are performed to measure the welded structure properties, which focus on the tensile strength based on the governing parameters. In the development of the prediction system model the data obtained from the governing parameters and the tensile strength measurement are classified into two different classes, high and low tensile strength, as input for the SVM classifier through training and testing the data from both classes for pattern classification and model development. The result of the testing and evaluation stage of the proposed system model shown the achievement of the prediction accuracy of 100% for each training and testing system on both classes. The study proved the proposed system model is fully accurate.

To handle this problem, this research conducts an effort to develop methods to determine tensile strength properties of Friction Stir Welding (FSW) in Aluminum alloy using prediction model. An artificial intelligent technique, i.e. Artificial Neural Network (ANNs) is used to develop the prediction model. Initial work involves FSW welding experiment and testing of subsequent result to analyze the tensile strength properties of the welding structure based on process parameter input. Prediction model is developed based on Back Propagation (BP) of error to predict tensile strength of the FSW structure. Input parameters for the model is tool rotational speed and travel speed while output of the model is the tensile strength of FSW welded structures. Proposed prediction model is then trained with experiment data. Testing of the proposed prediction model was then conducted using unused experiment data from the training. Research result shows that proposed prediction model is aligned with experiment data. This shows that average error value from the training and testing is 0.010286 or very small (close to zero) which means that the desired output of the prediction model for the training and testing is close to each other. Result from regression graph for training and testing shows matching linear regression between output and target when compared to dash line of the ideal result. This shows an absolute linear relationship where R equals to 0.9 or close to 1. This proves good compatibility the prediction model. © IEOM Society International.","Artificial neural network; Friction stir welding; Tensile strength",,,,,,,"Chen, S.C., Lin, S.W., Tseng, T.Y., Lin, H.C., Optimization of back-propagation network using simulated annealing approach 2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics October 8-11, pp. 2819-2824. , 2006, Taipei, Taiwan; Uzun, H., Donne, C.D., Argagnotto, A., Ghidini, T., Gambaro, C., Friction stir welding of dissimilar Al 6013-T4 To X5CrNi18-10 stainless steel (2005) Materials & Design, 26, pp. 41-46; Okuyucu, H., Kurt, A., Erol Arcaklioglu, Artificial neural network application to the friction stir welding of aluminum plates (2007) Elsevier, Materials and Design, 28, pp. 78-84; Zhou, J., Ren, J., Yao, C., Multi-objective optimization of multi-axis ball-end milling Inconel 718 via grey relational analysis coupled with RBF neural network and PSO algorithm (2017) Elsevier, Measurement, 102, pp. 271-285. , May; Maleki, E., Sherafatnia, K., Investigation of single and dual step shot peening effects on mechanical and metallurgical properties of 18CrNiMo7-6 steel using artificial neural network (2016) Int.

Nevertheless the path force can vary significantly due to the fluctuation of workpiece temperature and other process variations, thus results in inconsistency in weld microstructure. This paper describes the system integration of a FSW machine with a focus on the development of a traverse controlled table in order to produce a consistent temperature and path force along the weld path in FSW process. Aluminium alloy 6061 plate and a FSW’s tool with a flat shoulder and conical pin without thread are used.

High stress and strain occur at the rotating tool, consisting of a pin (probe) and a shoulder, during the friction stir process. The geometrical design of the tool has some impact in terms of stress and strain once static load is applied against the tool. In this work, specific stress can be found on the tool due to the plunging and travel process that is analysed using finite element method. In the present work, a steady state finite element stress analysis of friction stir welding was carried out using CATIA V5 software. The critical points of the FSW tool are located mainly on the edge between the shoulder and the pin, where a large amount of stress is found and further leads to failure or tool defects. This critical stress and strain can be reduced by enlarging the diameter size of the pin and increasing tool life. © 2015 The Authors.","finite element analysis; friction stir welding; stress-strain simulation","Energy efficiency; Friction; Friction stir welding; Intelligent control; Research laboratories; Robotics; Smart sensors; Stress analysis; Tribology; Welding; Finite element stress analysis; Friction stir process; Friction stir welding(FSW); Geometrical designs; Solid-state joining; Stress and strain; Stress strain; Stress-strain response; Finite element method",,,,"Universiti Teknologi MARA, UiTM: 600-RMI/DANA 5/3/PSF (9/2015","The research team wishes to thank Universiti Teknologi MARA for the financial support given under the grant number 600-RMI/DANA 5/3/PSF (9/2015) and the Research Management Institute (RMI) for the management assistance.","Mishraa, R.S., Mab, Z.Y., (2005) Friction Stir Welding and Processing, pp. 1-78; Pfeiffer, C., Investigation of friction stir welding of stainless steel using a stop action-technique (2012) Materials Research, 409, pp. 293-298; Nandan, R., Bhadeshia, Recent advances in friction-stir welding - Process, weldment structure and properties (2008) Progress in Materials Science, 53, pp. 980-1023; Mohamadreza Nourani, A.S.M., Yannacopoulos, S., (2011) Taguchi Optimization of Process Parameters in Friction Stir Welding of 6061 Aluminium Alloy: A Review and Case Study, 3, pp. 144-155. , http://www.scirp.org/journal/eng; Davis, T.A., Yao, B., Observer-Based Adaptive Robust Control of Friction Stir Welding Axial Force (2011) 1032 IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics, 16 (6), pp. 1032-1039; Kumar, S.V.K., The role of friction stir welding tool on material flow and weld formation (2008) Materials Science and Engineering A, 485, pp. 367-374; Gebhard, M.F.Z.P., Dynamical behaviour of machine tools during friction stir welding (2010) Prod.

Competitive advantage has become a major concern for companies in today's global market, especially the chemical industry. Based on an analysis of past research, there has been no research investigating information technology, strategic leadership, and overall knowledge management of competitive advantage in the context of chemical companies in Indonesia. Furthermore, the novelty of this research is to examine the relationship between information technology, leadership, and knowledge management on the competitive advantage in a research model. This study uses a quantitative method with a research population of chemical companies in Indonesia, total 1519 companies and a sample of 114 companies. The sampling technique uses an intentional sampling method, and the data analysis uses multiple regression analysis with SPPS 25. The results of this study indicate that information technology, strategic leadership, and knowledge management have a significant positive relationship with a competitive advantage. The implications of this study indicate that a manager's leadership strategy ability and the application of knowledge management for employees in this industry significantly influence competitive advantage. The use of information technology for strategic purposes should be more widely applied to increase competitive advantage. © 2020 IEEE.","Competitive Advantage; Information technology; Knowledge Management; Strategic Leadership","Chemical analysis; Chemical industry; Competition; Human resource management; International trade; Chemical companies; Competitive advantage; Multiple regression analysis; Quantitative method; Research models; Sampling method; Sampling technique; Strategic leadership; Knowledge management",,,,,,"Pratama, W.P., (2019) Chemical Industry Ready to Compete in Industry Development 4. 0, , https://ekonomi.bisnis.com/read/20190129/257/883700/ChemicalIndustryReadytoCompeteinIndustryDevelopment4.0, Bisnis. com; Siwi, C.C., Massie, J.D., Tumewu, F., An analysis of bankruptcy prediction in manufacturing firm by using bankruptcy models (case study in chemical sub sector listed in Indonesia stock exchange 2013-2017) (2018) J.

Therefore, the higher education institutions demand the lecturers also supporting staff to acquire aligned behaviors in organizational citizenship and knowledge management. This research aims to measure organization citizenship behavior (OCB) and knowledge management behavior (KMB) of supporting staff in a higher education institution. The research was conducted at the Bina Nusantara University, especially supporting staff at Kemanggisan Campus Jakarta. Organizational citizenship behavior as the independent variable is reflected perfectly into five dimensions - altruism, civic virtue, consciousness, courtesy, and sportsmanship. Knowledge management behavior as the dependent variable is reflected perfectly into three dimensions: knowledge creation, knowledge sharing, and knowledge update. The measurement and structural model developed by using SmartPLS explain that OCB has a positive and significant impact on KMB. The results of statistical tests show that female supporting staffs more than five years of service has a higher score in OCB and KMB significantly. © 2020 IEEE.","Demographic characteristics; Human capital; ICT; Knowledge management behavior; Organizational citizenship behavior; Organizational learning; Social web","Behavioral research; Human resource management; Dependent variables; Higher education institutions; Independent variables; Knowledge creations; Knowledge-sharing; Organizational citizenship behaviors; Quality of education; Structural modeling; Knowledge management",,,,,,"Nonaka, I., Toyama, R., The theory of the knowledge-creating firm: Subjectivity, objectivity and synthesis (2005) Ind.

One of them is a service industry that relies on knowledge-based activities to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. Knowledge workers are employees who increase the value of enterprises by producing, creating, developing, and applying knowledge at work, regardless of their educational background. During their tenure, they are able to solve problems creatively. Knowledge management behaviours are about organizational routine activities. Specifically, a knowledge management behaviour is an individual activity of collecting, managing, applying, sharing and updating knowledge, as a dynamic humanist process. The dimensions of knowledge management behaviours are creating, disseminating, collaborating, learning, applying, strengthening and recycling knowledge. The purpose of this research is to find out the differences among Indonesian knowledge workers in service industries in Jakarta based on demographic factors. A survey of 137 respondents was conducted using a questionnaire as the data collection method. The results show that there is a difference in the knowledge management of Indonesian knowledge workers based on gender. However, there were no differences in knowledge management of Indonesian knowledge workers based on education, tenure and age. © Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Demographic factors; Human resources management; Knowledge management behaviour; Knowledge worker",,,,,,,"Al-Zu'bi, H.A., Organizational Citizenship Behavior and Impacts on Knowledge Sharing: An Empirical Study (2011) International Business Research, 4 (3), pp. 221-227. , https://doi.org/10.5539/ibr.v4n3p221; Aliakbar, E., Yusoff, R.B., Hasnaa, N., Mahmood, N., (2014) Determinants of Knowledge Sharing Behavior Determinants of Knowledge Sharing Behavior, pp. 208-215. , 29(February 2012); Bakhari Ismail, M., Mohammad Yusof, Z., Demographic Factors and Knowledge Sharing Quality among Malaysian Government Officers Communications of the IB IMA Demographic Factors and Knowledge Sharing Quality among Malaysian Government Officers (2009) Communications of the IBIMA, 9, pp. 1-8; Boateng, H., Dzandu, D.M., Agyemang, F.G., The effects of demographic variables on knowledge sharing Article information (2015) Library Review, 64 (3), pp. 216-228; Celep, C., Çetin, B., Teachers' perception about the behaviours of school leaders with regard to knowledge management (2005) International Journal of Educational Management, 19 (2), pp. 102-117. , https://doi.org/10.1108/09513540510582408; Chen, C.J., Huang, J.W., How organizational climate and structure affect knowledge management-The social interaction perspective (2007) International Journal of Information Management, 27 (2), pp. 104-118. , https://doi.Org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2006.ll.001; Chou, S.Y., Ramser, C., A multilevel model of organizational learning: Incorporating employee spontaneous workplace behaviors, leadership capital and knowledge management (2018) Learning Organization, , https://doi.org/10.1108/TLO-10-2018-0168; Chun-Hsien, L., Fang-Pei, N., Chin-Yung, P., Tao-Sheng, C., A Study on the Correlations between Knowledge Sharing Behavior and Organizational Citizenship Behavior in Catering Industry: The Viewpoint of Theory of Planned Behavior (2014) Anthropologist, 17 (3), pp. 873-881; Darroch, J., Developing a measure of knowledge management behaviors and practices (2003) Journal of Knowledge Management, 7 (5), pp. 41-54. , https://doi.org/10.1108/13673270310505377; Dhabi, A., (2018) Role of organisational culture, leadership and organisational citizenship behaviour on knowledge management Amna Ali AlMansouri *.

One of reasons is their weak sensing capability. This research intends to examine the effect of sensing capability (SC) on how logistics service firms-financial performance (LSF-FP) pass through innovative logistics services (ILS). This research used a quantitative method. Data was collected using questionnaires and probability sampling. The sample size consisted of 150 respondents from logistics service firms (LSF) registered as members of Association (ILFA) in the Jakarta (Jabodetabek) region. Unit of observation was constituted by leaders (managers or directors) of the firms. The collected data was analysed by using the SEM-PLS program. This research found that SC had importance role on ILS and financial performance of LSF-FP in Indonesia. In term of implementation, SC must be able to ILS in order to have a more significant impact on their financial performance of LSF-FP. © Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Financial performance; Innovative logistics services; Logistics service firm; Sensing capability",,,,,,,"Aguinis, H., (2014) Performance Management, , Third Edition.

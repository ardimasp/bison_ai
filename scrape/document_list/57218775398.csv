This research was aimed to evaluate the relationship among the college student’s knowledge, experience, perception, and purchase intension of probiotics among the Jabodetabek (Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, Bekasi) college students. The questionnaire responses from 200 participants with diverse demographic backgrounds were collected. The results showed that the average score on the probiotic knowledge and perception was good. According to chi-square test, there was no correlation among all variables of demographic on probiotic knowledge and experience. Furthermore, only respondent’s experience played a role in their perception of probiotics (p value = 0.00) which was correlated to purchase intention indicated by p value = 0.00. © 2020 The Authors.

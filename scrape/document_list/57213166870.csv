It is emphasizing flexibility and reusability add value to the company system. XYZ Company is an engaged in the air transportation business. To face competition the Company should be has a loyalty system that aims to increase engagement with customers, help to maintain existing customers, and as an attraction for prospective customers. The purpose of study is to design a loyalty system based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The results of this study are a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based loyalty system design, the system design includes application architecture, application infrastructure, network infrastructure, and process business design. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

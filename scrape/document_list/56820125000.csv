However, little research on FOMO and its relation to tourism destination image has been conducted. The objective of this paper is to analyze how image of 10 new prioritized tourist destinations in Indonesia affects Tourism college students as part of Generation Z, particularly related to FOMO. This research used a quantitative method to investigate how destination image influences students' FOMO. E-questionnaires were used as a survey instrument. Results of the study suggest that there is a relatively small linear causal relationship between destination image and FOMO. © 2020 IEEE.","Destination; FOMO; Image; Tourism","Information management; Surveys; Tourism; Causal relationships; College students; Common traits; Destination image; Indonesia; Quantitative method; Survey instruments; Tourist destinations; Students",,,,,"Alcocer, N.H., Ruiz, V.R.L., The role of destination image in tourist satisfaction: The case of a heritage site (2018) Economic Research-Ekonomska Istraživanja, , Routledge; Aluthaybi, How can social networks design trigger fear of missing out?

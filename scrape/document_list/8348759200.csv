Customer experience should become a key role in developing business model innovation in driving transformational performance. This paper argues that the transformational performance is derived from business model innovation and focuses on customer experience. We use telecommunication firms as our unit analysis with sample of 195 Indonesian ICT firms out of 542 units. The analytical approach and solution technique that is used for analysis is Partial Least Square (PLS). The findings demonstrate that business model played significant role on supporting contribution of customer experience in driving transformational performance. The finding has implication that by synergizing the value proposition of customer experience in a business model innovation, the transformational performance can be maintained through focus on customer experience driven business model innovation. Further study can be explored through additional variable, sample and further study on longitudinal on digital transformation firms. © 2020 by the authors.","Business Model Innovation; Customer experience; Industry 4.0; Transformational Performance",,,,,,"Amit, R., Zott, C., Value creation in e-business (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22, pp. 493-520; Amit, R., Zott, C., Business model innovation: Creating value in times of change (2010) Universia Business Review, 3. , https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1701660; Basceanu, L., (2014) Business Model Innovation and Value Co-Creation - Based on a Single Case Study on Liz Claiborne, , http://studenttheses.cbs.dk/bitstream/handle/10417/4570/lelia_ecaterina_basceanupdf.pdf?sequence=1, Retrieved from; Berman, S.J., Digital transformation: Opportunities to create new business models (2012) Strategy and Leadership, 40 (2), pp. 16-24; Bolton, R.N., (2016) Service Excellence: Creating Customer Experiences That Build Relationships, , http://www.ruthnbolton.com/Webinar160915_Bolton.pdf, N.

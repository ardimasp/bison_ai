Besides using traditional methods such as credit scoring, machine learning can also be used as a tool to classify applications for credit. Many research papers had tested and concluded of the ability of machine learning methods to classify good and bad credit. From the previous papers it was concluded that Ensemble Method, Support Vector Machine and MLP (Neural Network) showed the best accuracy in credit risk. However those previous papers compared only a few algorithms so it is difficult to determine which algorithm has the best performance. Therefore, this paper will compare the algorithms from previous paper by applying the German dataset to the algorithms as it is the most common dataset used for credit risk analysis. The algorithms compared are Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Ensemble Methods (random forest, bagging, boosting) and MLP. The performance will be measured using accuracy, average accuracy from 10 fold cross validation, AUC, Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision rate, F1. This paper will focus to find the most accurate algorithm for credit risk analysis. From the result it was found out that Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Bagging had a good result. However, since the scores were dispersed, it was difficult to conclude which algorithm had the best accuracy. At the end SVM was chosen as it was deemed to be the most accurate algorithm for credit risk analysis. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The growth of mHealth applications in the past decade has been very impressive. Nonetheless, the adoption of mHealth applications in Indonesia has been relatively low. In this research, the usability of a popularly used mHealth application in Indonesia called Halodoc was explored. The usability study was conducted in three phases, which included a usability evaluation of the existing application, a user interface (UI) redesign, and an evaluation of the new prototype. The usability evaluation was performed by a panel of UI/UX practitioners by following the ten principles of Nielsen's usability heuristics. Findings from the usability evaluation showed that many of the usability issues found in the existing application were related to 'visibility of system status', 'helping users to recognize, diagnose and recover from errors', and 'user control and freedom'. To address the identified usability issues, the user interface of the original version of the mobile application was redesigned. The developed prototype was evaluated by the same panel of evaluators. The results showed that the usability of the original version of the application had been improved. In addition, the new prototype helped to improve the findability and accessibility of the application. © 2020 ACM.","mHealth; Nielsen's heuristics; Prototype; Usability; User interface","Electronic commerce; Heuristic methods; mHealth; Usability engineering; Indonesia; Mobile applications; System status; Three phasis; Usability evaluation; Usability heuristics; Usability studies; User control; User interfaces",,,,,"(2018) Liquid State, , https://liquid-state.com/mhealth-Apps-market-snapshot/, The rise of mHealth apps: A market snapshot.

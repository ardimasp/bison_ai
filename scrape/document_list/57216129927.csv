Choosing a certain type of formwork method will affect the time and cost of a project. There are two types of formwork method, the conventional method and the semi-system method. This research will compare the two methods on the cost, time and waste products on their application on beams, columns and slab of a construction building project. The aim of this research is to compare the cost, time and waste product of the two formwork method on a construction building project. A high rise construction building project with 24 floors will be used as a case study in this research. Based on this research it is found that the conventional system cost 12% more than the semi-system. It also needed 12 more days to finish and also produce 10% more waste than the semi-system. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","comparison; conventional; formwork; semi-system","Construction; comparison; Construction building; conventional; Conventional methods; Formwork; High-rise construction; Installation methods; semi-system; Cost benefit analysis",,,,,"Nugroho, S.P., (2018) Analysis of Cost Comparison between Multiplex Formwork and Tegofilm Formwork for HIghrise Building Columns; Wilshere, C., (1989) Formwork; Hanna, A.S., (1998) Concrete Formwork Systems; Umum, K.P., (2013) Peraturan Menteri Pekerjaan Umum No. 11/PRT/M/2013 Tentang Pedoman Analisis Harga Satuan (AHSP) Pekerjaan Bidang Umum; Arumsari, P., Juliastuti, Al'Farisi, M.K., Cost estimation using ministerial regulation of public work no. 11/2013 in construction projects (2017) The International Conference on Eco Engineering Development 2017 (ICEED 2017), IOP Conf.

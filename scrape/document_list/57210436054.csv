A unique characteristic of the Indonesian audit environment is that Big4 auditors can only enter the market indirectly through affiliation with a local audit firm. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of Indonesian listed companies between 2008 and 2015 is used to investigate this relation using ordinary least squares (OLS). To address the concern that the choice for Big4-affiliated auditors might reflect client characteristics, the authors also perform OLS on a matched sample, using both propensity-score and entropy-balance matching. Findings: Across all three samples, the authors document that companies audited by a Big4-affiliated local audit firm display lower debt ratios. The authors find no such effect for affiliation with second-tier audit firms. Surprisingly, they find that the negative effect of Big4 affiliation is increasing in client size. Research limitations/implications: This study provides evidence of the consequences of hiring Big4 auditors on the perceived information asymmetry by financial markets under extreme conditions: in an environment characterized by low litigation risk and where Big4 auditors can operate only indirectly through affiliation. Practical implications: The results of this study are of interest to policymakers, managers and financial stakeholders in emerging countries where external financing is important yet difficult to obtain because of severe information asymmetry. Hiring a Big4 auditor, even only through affiliation, might reduce perceived information asymmetry and increase the access to external equity financing. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to provide evidence of the effect of Big4 auditors on their clients’ capital structure when they can operate only indirectly through affiliation with a local auditor. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big4 audit firms; Capital structure; Emerging markets",,,,,,"The authors gratefully acknowledge support by the Indonesian Endowment Fund for education (LPDP Indonesia) [Grant No. PRJ-726/LPDP/2014]-) and the Hercules Foundation [Grant No. AUGE/11/013].","Armstrong, C.S., Barth, M.E., Jagolinzer, A.D., Riedl, E.J., Market reaction to the adoption of IFRS in Europe (2010) The Accounting Review, 85 (1), pp. 31-61; Atkins, M., Glen, J.D., Comparing corporate capital structures around the globe (1992) The International Executive, 34 (5), pp. 369-387; Ball, R., Infrastructure requirements for an economically efficient system of public financial reporting and disclosure (2001) Brookings-Wharton Papers on Financial Services, 2001 (1), pp. 127-182; Barth, M.E., Kasznik, R., McNichols, M.F., Analyst coverage and intangible assets (2001) Journal of Accounting Research, 39 (1), pp. 1-34; Becker, C.L., DeFond, M., Jiambalvo, J., Subramanyam, K.R., The effect of audit quality on earnings management (1998) Contemporary Accounting Research, 15 (1), pp. 1-24; Bharath, S.T., Pasquariello, P., Wu, G.J., Does asymmetric information drive capital structure decisions?

There is less conclusive evidence of a difference in the magnitude of the effect of Big4 affiliation versus affiliation with a second-tier audit firm.

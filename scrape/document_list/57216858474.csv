Good credit growth and expansion is needed to be in line with credit quality improvement so the maximum profit could be generated. This research seek to answer these question, how quantitative and qualitative data inside system that use decision tree can optimalized credit quality determination on PT. XYZ. Algorithm that is used in the Decision Tree method is Iterative Dichotomizer Three (ID3). Some of the advantages of ID3 Algorithm which are it could create understandable predicition rules, more faster, and only need some attribute test until all data is classified. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

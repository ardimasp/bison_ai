But the shipping process still encountered several obstacles, such as: lack of skills to pack the shipped goods, time to go and queue to the Expedition Company as well as information on shipping expedition rates. Based on these problems, conducted research to find solutions that can help people in the delivery of goods in the form of Android Pickaja application. Pickaja application developed is an intermediary service between shippers and the expedition. With GPS, Google Maps and Google Cloud Messaging are used to help exchange information and display notifications. GPS and Google Maps are used to determine pickup location, Pickaja looks for picker based on latitude and longitude and shows picker location. The evaluation was done by distributing questionnaires. Based on the results of these evaluations, it can be concluded that Pickaja designed to provide solutions to existing problems and meet user expectations. © 2017 IEEE.","Google Cloud Messaging; Google Maps; GPS; Pengiriman Barang","Contracts; Global positioning system; Information management; Ships; Surveys; Web services; Delivery of goods; Existing problems; Google Cloud Messaging; Google maps; Intermediary services; Pengiriman Barang; Shipping process; User expectations; Android (operating system)",,,,,"Kemp, S., (2017) Digital in 2017: Global Overview-We Are Social, , https://wearesocial.com/special-reports/digital-in-2017-global-overview, [Online], [Accessed: 06-Sep-2017]; Brähler, S., Analysis of the android architecture (2010) Os.Ibds.Kit.Edu, p. 52; Safaat, N.H., (2012) Pemrograman Aplikasi Mobile Smartphone Dan Tablet PC Berbasis Android, , Bandung: Penerbit Informatika; Koppers, J., (2015) Location Based Services: Positioning Techniques; Vanjire, S., Kanchan, U., Shitole, G., Patil, P., Location based services on smart phone through the android application (2014) Provider, 3 (1), pp. 4982-4987; Kushwaha, A., Kushwaha, V., Location based services using android mobile operating system.pdf (2011) Int.

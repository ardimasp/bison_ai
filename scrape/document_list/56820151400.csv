The objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between factors of job satisfaction to employee intention to leave at Arion Swiss Belhotel in Jakarta and Bandung. The survey was conducted to 240 employees in nine departments in both hotels, using a questionnaire adapting JDI. Findings indicated that the highest influencing factors affecting employees’ turnover was the work environment, followed by pay, and opportunity for job promotion. There is no difference between employees in both hotels in their perception towards each of the variables; as well there is no difference between layers of management. The overall finding results can be used for the hotels to set the guidelines to improve the employees’ job satisfaction and reducing the turnover rate. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

Today, mobile technology not only held by adults but also kids. The proportion of kids who used smartphones is increasing each year. The growing technology in mobile applications encourages developers to build educational apps to help kids learn to know alphabets, numbers, animals, and simple calculations in a fun way. This paper describes an educational “Homy Kid Lesson” as an Android-based application. The goal of this Homy Kid Lesson is helping children to know numbers, recognize letters, recognize animal names, and to perform simple calculations with an attractive interface. Research methods include data collection, design, and implementation. The development is done through the research literature, comparing it with similar apps, interviews, and questionnaires. Application design uses a storyboard. Its implementation refers to Extreme Programming (XP) model. The result is an educational application “Homy Kid Lesson” which can be a learning tool and as electronic media for learning with interest and fun concept. Contribution and novelty are increasing the ability of children to recognize letters and numbers early, increase the knowledge of animal names, introducing how to spell the letters and numbers to children also train the child’s ability to simple counting and introduced the method of learning with electronic media. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

By providing a means that has a comprehensive health management starting from the body, mind and spirit, which contributes to the recovery of health and illness, becomes one solution that can be done to improve the level of health and also as a means of promoting health, preventing disease and helping to improve aware of the disease in our lives. The link between health and the surrounding environment can be proven in a dimension that integrates visual, auditory, olfactory, kinaesthetic, vestibular and proprioception sensations win the form of room quality that can support the health process indirectly. This paper aims to discuss the importance of the importance of applying a quality space based on the healing space principle by examining the literature review. The result is a brief design guideline for holistic care centre with healing spaces concept. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Design Guidelines; Healing Space; Holistic Healthcare","Design; Healing Space; Health management; Health process; Literature reviews; Space concept; Space-based; Surrounding environment; Health",,,,,"(2018) World Urbanization Prospects: The 2018 Revision, , https://population.un.org/wup/Country-Profiles/, U.

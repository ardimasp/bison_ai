In running its business processes, PT Bank KEB Hana Indonesia promotes Information Technology (IT) to fulfill its vision, mission, and business objectives and operational services to customers. Therefore, IT governance needs to be implemented properly to provide good results for the company's achievements. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the maturity level of IT Governance at PT Bank KEB Hana Indonesia to measure IT governance in the core banking system development project. Evaluation was measured using the Process Assessment Model (PAM) of the COBIT 5 Framework which refers to 9 selected COBIT 5 processes namely EDM02, APO04, BAIO1, BAI02, BAI04, BAI05, BAI06, BAI08, and DSS03. Data collection used in this research is primary data obtained through interviews and questionnaires, and secondary data through observation stages. Data was analyzed with COBIT 5 Framework through 8 questionnaires retrieved from respondents using Rating Scale Formulas to find out the Capability Level scale for each Activity and Output in the selected COBIT 5 process. From the evaluation results, it is known that 9 processes are still at Level1 (Performed) where the results are still below the expected Capability Level, that is Level 4 (Predictable). So that the Gap Analysis obtained is 3, then the results are used to establish improvement recommendation based on Framework COBIT 5. © 2018 IEEE.","Capability Level; COBIT 5; IT Governance; Process Assessment Model (PAM)","Pattern recognition; Surveys; Business objectives; Capability Level; COBIT 5; Evaluation results; Improvement recommendations; IT governance; Operational service; Process assessments; Online systems",,,,,"Nengah, I.P., Adopted COBIT-5 framework for system design of Indonesia navy IS/IT: An evaluation (2017) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 12, pp. 6420-6427; Zandhessami, H., Hasan, M.K., Prioritization of COBIT framework processes based on sazehgostar saipa's information technology strategies (2011) Asian Journal of Management Research, 2; Fajrin, R.A., Perancangan Tata Kelola Teknologi Informasi di BAPAPSI Pemkab Bandung Menggunakan framework COBIT 5 Pada Domain EDM dan DSS (2016) Journal of Information Systems Engineering and Business Intelligence, 2; Firmansyah, D., Pengukuran Kapabilitas Pengelolaan Sistem Informasi Sub Domain Deliver, Service, Support 01 Menggunakan Framework Cobit 5 Studi Kasus: Politeknik Komputer Niaga LPKIA Bandung (2015) Konferensi Nasional Sistem & Informatika; Nugroho, H., Perancangan Model Kapabilitas Optimasi Sumber Daya TI Berdasarkan COBIT 5 Process Capability Model (2014) Jurnal Teknologi Informasi, 1; (2012) A Business Framework for the Governance and Management of Enterprise IT, , ISACA.

Pusdatin sees cloud computing as a technological innovation opportunity that promises lower costs, provides flexibility and optimization of resource, and ease of monitoring and management of servers and applications that can become a solution for the problems and concerns faced today. However, Pusdatin is faced with questions of how to properly adopt cloud technologies in their environment and gain all those benefits. This study uses Roadmap for Cloud Computing Adoption (ROCCA) model for the adoption strategy development. ROCCA adoption model consists of 5 phases namely the analysis, planning, adoption, migration, and management. Data were gathered from an interview, direct observation, and running several discovery tools within Pusdatin's IT environment. Data then processed through each phase of ROCCA model that produces the analysis, establishment of cloud program team, criteria, cloud architecture, migration steps, timeline, and priority that forms the detailed strategy for adopting cloud computing. The results of this study are recommended strategic steps to simplify and accelerate the implementation of cloud computing technology at Pusdatin. © 2018 IEEE.","Cloud Computing Adoption Strategy in Government Institution; Cloud Computing Adoption Strategy with ROCCA model","Agriculture; Information systems; Information use; Pattern recognition; Planning; Cloud architectures; Cloud computing technologies; Data and information; Direct observations; Government institutions; Monitoring and management; Strategy development; Technological innovation; Cloud computing",,,,,"Pettey, C., Goasduff, L., (2018) Gartner Says Worldwide Public Cloud Services Market to Grow 18 Percent in 2017, , https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3616417, Gartner Newsroom (2017), [Electronic Version], March 9; Smith, D.M., (2017) Cloud Computing Primer for 2017, , https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?ct=170213&id=1-3TEKSKV&kui=D0EgBghKvGoqN1SYaqHXkA&st=sb, Gartner, [Electronic Version] 2018, March 9; Shimba, F., (2010) Cloud Computing: Strategies for Cloud Computing Adoption, , https://arrow.dit.ie/scschcomdis/29/, Dublin Institute of Technology, Retrieved March 25, 2018, from; Woods, J., Five options for migrating applications to the cloud: Rehost, refactor, revise, rebuild or replace (2011) Gartner the Future of IT Conference, , https://gartnerinfo.com/futureofit2011/MEX38L_A2%20mex38l_a2.pdf, October 4-6, Centro Banamex Mexico City, Mexico [2018, June 20]; Harrison, J., (2010) Essentials of Strategic Planning in Healthcare, , Health Administration Press, 1 edition; Harrison, J., (2012) Government Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Concerning the Implementation of Electronic Systems and Transactions, , PP Number 82 of 2012, Republic of Indonesia; Harrison, J., (2016) Regulation of the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Indonesia Concerning the Implementation of Information and Communication Technology at the Ministry of Agriculture, , Permentan Number 51 of 2016, Republic of Indonesia; Hafner, J., Schwingel, S., Ayers, T., Masuch, R., (2017) Azure Strategy and Implementation Guide, , https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/azure-strategy-and-implementation-guide/en-us/, Microsoft Corporation, [Electronic Version] 2018, June 20; Briggs, B., Kassner, E., (2017) Enterprise Cloud Strategy 2nd Edition, , Microsoft Press; Warnars, H.L.H.S., Lanita, Y., Prasetyo, A., Randriatoamanana, R., Smart integrated payment system for public transportation in Jakarta (2017) Bulletin of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, 6 (3), pp. 241-249. , September 2017; Agtriadi, H.B., Chandra, N., Warnars, H.L.H.S., Gaol, F.L., Software size measurement with use case point for employee application software at STT-PLN (2017) Cybernetics and Computational Intelligence (CyberneticsCom), 2017 IEEE International Conference On, , Phuket, Thailand, 20-22 Nov 2017; Tambotoh, J.J.C., Isa, S.M., Gaol, F.L., Soewito, B., Warnars, H.L.H.S., Software quality model for internet of things governance (2016) The 3rd International Conference on Data and Software Engineering (ICoDSE)2016, , 26-27th Oct 2016, Bali, Indonesia; Iskandar, K., Gaol, F.L., Soewito, B., Warnars, H.L.H.S., Kosala, R., Software size measurement of knowledge management portal with use case point (2016) The International Conference on Computer, Control, Informatics, and Its Applications (IC3INA 2016), pp. 42-47. , 3-5 Oct 2016, Tangerang, Indonesia; Warnars, H.L.H.S., Object oriented modeling with unified modelling language 2.0 for simple software application based on agile methodology (2011) Behaviour & Information Technology An International Journal, 30 (3), pp. 293-307; Christy, J., Hintarsyah, A.P., Warnars, H.L.H.S., Forecasting sebagai decision support systems aplikasi dan penerapannya untuk mendukung proses pengambilan keputusan (2018) Jurnal Sistem Komputer, 8 (1), pp. 19-27. , May 2018; Warnars, H.L.H.S., Rancangan infrastruktur e-bisnis business intelligence pada perguruan tinggi (2008) Journal Telkomnika, 6 (2), pp. 115-124. , August 2008; Warnars, H.L.H.S., Analisa dampak investasi teknologi informasi proyek data warehouse pada perguruan tinggi swasta dengan metode simple roi (2008) Journal Informatika, 9 (2), pp. 101-108. , November 2008","Harisno; Information System Management Department, Indonesia; email: harisno@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1st Indonesian Association for Pattern Recognition International Conference, INAPR 2018","7 September 2018 through 8 September 2018",,144686,,9781538694220,,,"English","Indones.

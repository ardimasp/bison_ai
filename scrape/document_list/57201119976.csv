The methodology used is the knowledge management component of People Perspective, Process Perspective and Technology Perspective. The data in this study were taken from questionnaires to 86 respondents who interacted with knowledge management system application. Data were analyzed using smartPLS with Structural Equation Model (SEM) approach to test data from questionnaire using factor analysis method. It can be concluded that 10 main component factors Knowledge Management (KM) influence to the problem of performance improvement of KMS workforce in PT Data Citra Mandiri. © 2017 IEEE.","Employee performance; Knowledge; Knowledge management (KM); Knowledge management system (KMS)","Behavioral research; Human resource management; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Personnel rating; Surveys; Employee performance; Evaluation of knowledge; Factor analysis method; Knowledge; Knowledge distribution; Knowledge management system; Performance improvements; Structural equation modeling; Information management",,,,,"Bhatt, D., Efqm :Excellence model and knowledge management implications (2000) EFQM Excell.

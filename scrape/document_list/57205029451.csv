The data analysis method is using SEM-PLS with WarpPLS 5.0. The findings demonstrate that there is an effect on internal integration and customer integration against schedule attainment, and no effect on the integration of supplier. Meanwhile, integration of supplier has an influence on competitive performance, while integration of supplier and integration of internal has no effect. As a result, to gain schedule attainment, the manager should improve the integration of internal and customer. Other than that, to enhance the CP, the CI also must be increased. © 2018 IEEE.","competitive performance; customer integration; internal integration; schedule attainment; supplier integration","Information management; Sales; Supply chains; Competitive performance; Customer integrations; Data analysis methods; Integration of suppliers; Quantitative research; research methods; Supplier integration; Supply-chain integration; Integration",,,,,"Gunawan, H., Persaingan Meningkat Logistik Indonesia Tertinggi di Asean, , http://www.tribunnews.com/bisnis/2017/05/16/persainganmeningkat-logistik-indonesia-Tertinggi-di-Asean, Retrieved 20-06-2018 from; Van der Vaart, T., Van Donk, D.P., A critical review of surveybased research in supply chain integration (2008) International Journal of Production Economics, 111 (1), pp. 42-55; Kumar, V., Chibuzo, E.N., Garza-Reyes, J.A., Kumari, A., Rocha-Lona, L., Lopez-Torres, G.C., The impact of supply chain integration on performance: Evidence from the UK food sector (2017) Procedia Manufacturing, 11, pp. 814-821; Chatzoudes, D., Chatzoglou, P., Supply Chain Integration (SCI) measured from an information sharing perspective: Examining its impact on business success (2015) IEEE 9th International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS), Athens, pp. 52-63; Zhao, L., Huo, B., Sun, L., Zhao, X., The impact of supply chain risk on supply chain integration and company performance: A global investigation"", supply chain management (2013) An International Journal, 182, pp. 115-131; Devaraj, S., Krajewski, L., Wei, J.C., Impact of eBusiness technologies on operational performance: The role of production information integration in the supply chain (2007) Journal of Operations Management, 25 (6), pp. 1199-1216; Huo, B., Ye, Y., Zhao, X., Shou, Y., The impact of human capital on supply chain integration and competitive performance (2016) International Journal of Production Economics, 178, pp. 132-143; Romano, P.D.P., Supply chain integration and efficiency performance: A study on the interactions between customer and supplier integration"".

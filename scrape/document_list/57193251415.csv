The research was continued by combining RFID, GPS, IP Camera and a smartpone android in order to build human tracking and monitoring system. All the item are connected to each other by Wi-Fi and will convey data to a station pc in the control room. Theme park as the location for deploying the system is the large area, consist of many indoors and outdoors playground and can be visited up to 4000 people/day. Human tracking and monitoring system is important for people who visit theme park, it help visitors to locate the position of their families, friends and relatives who are separated. The tracking system that is built using RFID and GPS works properly with 100% accuracy of indoor tracking and 3.27 meters erorrs for the outdoor tracking while the monitoring system that is built using IP camera and android smartphone also works properly with 100% accuracy in plotting the location of the object tracked to the map and 100% correctly choose active IP Cameras that is nearest to the object tracked. Thus this human tracking and monitoring system is suitable to track and monitor the human position for both indoor and outdoor especially in a theme park. © 2020, IJSTR.","Android Smartphone; GPS; Human Tracking; IoT Application; IP Camera; Monitoring System; RFID",,,,,"Binus University","The authors wish to thank Bina Nusantara University.

This paper demonstrates the implementation of home security system for homes using low cost and low power consumption wireless security systems. In this eco-friendly home security system, devices are installed in every home and will promptly notify residents and local security personnel during interruptions. The owner receives a Short Message Service (SMS) with a link to open the application installed in his/her android smartphone. The security guard also receives SMS with a link to open the map application to show the location of the house using its android smartphone.

But if the user goes into the room or building, then the human tracking application cannot get the user's position as the GPS signal cannot get through the wall. By using RFID, human tracking application can perform tracking in a certain closed area by providing room's or building's information that is entered. The IP camera as part of the system will send the images as visualization inside the room. In this research, human tracking system is built on a specific area that has lots of room or building such as a theme park or sports club. System is designed using an RFID reader, RFID tags, IP Camera, the database server and Android smartphones. The research was done inside Syahdan Campus, Bina Nusantara University - Jakarta.

In this paper, the research was continued by combining radio-frequency identification (RFID) and GPS in order to get better human tracking in both indoor and outdoor area. For indoor tracking, an RFID tag was carried by a user and continually read whenever he/she accessed a room while GPS was used mainly when the user was staying outdoor. GPS would be automatically activated whenever the user leaved the room 3 meters away. The accuracy of this tracking was 100% and the GPS could allocate the user every 3.27 meters.

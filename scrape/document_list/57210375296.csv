Human's emotion can be reflected through reading or writing a text. In recent years, studies on emotion detection through text has been developed. Most of the study is using a machine learning technique. In this paper, we classified 7 emotions such as anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, surprise, and thankfulness using deep learning technique that is Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Nested Long Short-Term Memory (Nested LSTM). We have compared our results with Support Vector Machine (SVM). We have trained each model with 980,549 training data and tested with 144,160 testing data. Our experiments showed that Nested LSTM and LSTM give better performance than SVM to detect emotions in text. Nested LSTM gets the best accuracy of 99.167%, while LSTM gets the best performance in term of average precision at 99.22%, average recall at 98.86%, and f1-score at 99.04%. © 2019 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.","Emotion detection; Machine learning; Nested LSTM; Sentiment analysis; Text mining",,,,,,"(2012) Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining, , San Rafael: Morgan & Claypool; Rahmath, H.P., Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis-Challenges and Applications (2014) International Journal of Application or Innovation in Engineering & Management, 3 (5), pp. 401-403. , May; Kaur, J., Saini, R.J., Emotion Detection and Sentiment Analysis in Text Corpus: A Differential Study with Informal and Formal Writing Styles (2014) International Journal of Computer Applications, 101 (9), pp. 1-9; Kim, S.M., (2011) Recognising Emotions and Sentiments in Text, , University of Sydney, Sydney; Buduma, N., (2017) Fundamentals of Deep Learning, , Sebastopol: O'Reilly Media, Inc; Singhal, P., Bhattacharyya, P., (2016) Sentiment Analysis and Deep Learning: A Survey; Arifin, P.K.E., Classification of Emotion in Indonesian Texts Using K-NN methods (2012) International Journal of Information and Electronics Engineering, pp. 899-903; Riany, J., Fajar, M., Lukman, M.P., Penerapan Deep Sentiment Analysis penerapan Deep Sentiment Analysis (2016) Jurnal Sisfo, 6, pp. 147-156; Miedema, F., (2018) Sentiment Analysis with Long Short-Term Memory networks; Moniz, J.R.A., Krueger, D., Nested LSTMs (2018) Computing Research Repository, 1801; Wang, W., Chen, L., Thirunarayan, K., Sheth, A.P., Harnessing Twitter ""Big Data for Automatic Emotion Identification,"" (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 ASE/IEEE International Conference on Social Computing and 2012 ASE/IEEE International Conference on Privacy, pp. 587-592. , Security, Risk and Trust; Shaheen, S., El-Hajj, W., Hajj, H., Elbassuoni, S., Emotion Recognition from Text Based on Automatically Generated Rules (2015) IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, pp. 383-392; Jain, E.U., Sandu, A., Emotion Detection from Punjabi Text using Hybrid Support Vector Machine and Maximum Entropy Algorithm (2015) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 4 (11); Muljono, N., Winarsih, A.S., Supriyanto, C., Evaluation of Classification Methods for Indonesian Text Emotion Detection (2016) International Seminar on Application for Technology of Information and Communication, pp. 130-133; Rahman, R., Islam, T., Ahmed, M.H., Detecting Emotion from Text and Emoticon (2017) London Journal of Research in Computer Science and Technology, 17 (3); Calefato, F., Lanubile, F., Novielli, N., EmoTxt: A Toolkit for Emotion Recognition from Text (2017) 2017 Seventh International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction Workshops and Demos; Mikolov, T., Sutskever, I., Chen, K., Corrado, G., Dean, J., Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and Their Compositionality (2013) in Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems-Volume 2, , Lake Tahoe, Nevada; Olah, C., (2015) Understanding LSTM Networks, , https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/, 27 August .

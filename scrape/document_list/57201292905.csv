There is a need for the application of a risk management information system for information asset security and has to be designed to identify risks and problems that exist at the online learning especially. Information system risk assessment must be watched out for because it can threaten the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of online learning activity and through this qualitative research which uses the OCTAVE ALLEGRO framework, critical assets can be identified together with the proposed prevention approach. © 2019 IEEE.","information system; octave allegro methodology; risk Assessment; risk management","E-learning; Information systems; Information use; Learning systems; Risk assessment; Risk management; Case-studies; Critical asset; Information assets; octave allegro methodology; Online learning; Online learning activities; Qualitative research; System risk assessment; Information management",,,,,"Ahmad, D., Jakaria, R., Dirgahayu, T., Hendrik, (2013) Manajemen Risiko Sistem Informasi Akademik Pada Perguruan Tinggi Menggunakan Metode Octave Allegro, , STMIK DCI, Teknologi Industri; Alberts, C., Dorofee, A., (2013) OCTAVESM Threat Profiles, , Software Engineering Institute Carnegie Mellon University; Alberts, C., Dorofee, A., Stevens, J., Woody, C., (2003) Introduction to the OCTAVE®.

This is very important because the employee tacit knowledge is potentially lost (knowledge walkout) due to employee turnover during a company's knowledge is not well documented using the system. PT Mahadana Dasha Utama (MahaDasha) is one of the company has been adopting e-learning system. MahaDasha is an investment holding company with several business units. MahaDasha uses open source moodle learning management system technology platform. The idea is triggered by the company's efficiency program in information technology investment both infrastructure and application development so it enforce MahaDasha’s IT team to find out the best innovation solution by optimizing open source technology which suitable with the user's need. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of e-learning adoption based on open source moodle technology platform by developing The DeLone & McLean Information Success Model and empirically measured the relation between aspect of information quality, system quality, service quality, user readiness and user satisfaction. The quantitative data are gained through questionnaire by distributing the questionnaires to all MahaDasha employees who use e-learning. The analysis of data indicated that the user satisfaction is the most positive influenced by information quality and user readiness. The contribution of this research was performed by evaluation process both for quality of trainer and IT support team based on result of the research. In the other hand, the system quality had been re-reviewed whether moodle application is suitable or not for user needs in MahaDasha. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS","Application; E-learning; Knowledge management system; Learning management system; Open source",,,,,,"Jafari, S.M., Salem, S.F., Moaddab, M.S., Salem, S.O., Learning Management System (LMS) success: An investigation among the university students (2016) 2015 IEEE Conf.

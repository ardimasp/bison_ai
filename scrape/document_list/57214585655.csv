That conventional payment method can be inefficient and ineffective for customers. Hence, the objective of this research is to analyze what would be the potential factors influencing customers in Jakarta especially who already have e-Money as prepaid product when making decisions whether using e-Money for their micro transactions payment. In this research, we implement qualitative methods using Focus Group Discussion and semi-structured interview. The respondents were from all over Jakarta. Through Focus Group Discussion and interview, we studied and obtained a better understanding about consumer attitude towards e-Money as prepaid product in their daily life. Finally, we provide suggestions for decision makers in both, banks, business people and local government to increase the number of both, users and micro payments using e-Money based on the analysis results. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

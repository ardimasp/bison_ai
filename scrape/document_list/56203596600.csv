The main objective of this study is to reduce the level of solar radiation incident on the building envelope. The building is located in Jakarta. The step of the study is as follows: (1) to create an initial building mass as the reference, (2) to create several alternatives of building forms to find the optimum reduction of the irradiance level, and (3) to study shading aids and its implementation on the building. The reduction of the irradiance level can be as high as 40% from the original building form by implanting the selective adaptive facade. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","adaptive façade; simulation; solar radiation","Facades; Solar buildings; Solar radiation; Building envelopes; Building facades; Building mass; Irradiance level; Jakarta; simulation; Incident solar radiation",,,,,"Aelenei, D., Aelenei, L., Vieira, C.P., Adaptive Façade: Concept, Applications, Research Questions (2016) Energy Procedia, 91, pp. 269-275; (2015) Adaptive Facade Network, , COST; Anderson, K., (2014) Design Energy Simulation for Architects: Guide to 3D Graphics; Counsellor, J.B., Master, B.V.L., Engineering, S., Taerwe, L., (2015) Structural Adaptive Façades Chloë Marysse, p. 254; Sjarifudin, F.U., Studi Mekanisme Kinetik dengan Parametrik Camshaft pada Selubung Bangunan Adaptif (2012) ComTech Comput.

Many applications could be accessed anytime and anywhere easily using Internet. Developers need tools to create their applications, one of them named code editor. The purpose of this research is to design and develop a real-time code editor application using web socket technology to help users collaborate while working on the project. This application provides a feature where users can collaborate on a project in real-time. The authors using analysis methodology which conducting on a study of the current code editor applications, distributing questionnaires and conducting on literature study. CodeR is a web application that provides workspace to writing, perform, display the results of the code through the terminal, and collaborate with other users in real-time. The application main features are providing workspace to make, execute and build the source code, real-time collaboration, chat, and build the terminal. This application supports C, C++, and Java programming languages. © 2015 The Authors.

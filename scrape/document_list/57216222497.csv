Not many studies have evaluated the characteristics of company resources that form business models so that they can winagainst competition. Pharmaceutical companies are no exception. Not all of the investments that have been allocated in company activities have a high impact. In this research, we want to test which resources have the most dominant influence on company performance, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. The variables studied were the levels of investment in the company, raw materials, advertising, training, and the number of workers on company performance. The data used are secondary longitudinal data from 5 pharmaceutical companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The results of this study indicate that advertising has the most potent influence on company performance in the pharmaceutical industry. These findings contradict the perception that pharmaceutical companies must prioritise raw materials. © 2019, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Advertising; Investment; Performance; Pharmaceutical; Raw material; Resource-based theory; Training",,,,,,"Andersen, J., Strategic resources and firm performance (2011) Management Decision, 49, pp. 87-98. , https://doi.org/10.1108/00251741111094455; Barney, J., Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17. , 1991, Na 1.99-120; Chen, P., Chan, W., Hung, S.W., Hsiang, Y., Wu, L., Do R&D Expenditures Matter More Than Those of Marketing To Company Performance?

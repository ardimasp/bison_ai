Several factors such as information quality, firm's reputation, perceived ease of payment, sites design, benefit of online shopping, and trust that influence customer decision to purchase from e-commerce sites were analyzed. Factors such as those mentioned above, which are commonly considered influencing purhasing decision through online shopping in other countries were hypothesized to be true in the case of Indonesia. A random sample comprised of 171 Indonesian people who have been buying goods/services through e-commerce sites at least once, were collected via online questionnaires. To test the hypothesis, the data were examined using Structural Equations Modeling (SEM) which is basically a combination of Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and linear Regression. The results suggest that information quality, perceived ease of payment, benefits of online shopping, and trust affect online purchase decision significantly. Close attention need to be placed on these factors to increase online sales. The most significant influence comes from trust. Indonesian people still lack of trust toward online commerce, so it is very important to gain customer trust to increase sales. E-commerce's business owners are encouraged to develop sites that can meet the expectation of potential customer, provides ease of payment system, provide detailed and actual information and responsible for customer personal information and transaction records. This paper outlined the key factors influencing online shopping intention in Indonesia and pioneered the building of an integrated research framework to understand how consumers make purchase decision toward online shopping; a relatively new way of shopping in the country. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

The sun will play a major part to create a good architecture, that would be part to create sustainable architecture. Buildings consume a lot of energy for cooling to achieve desirable thermal comfort conditions. In tropical climate, solar gain is resulting in high energy consumption, therefore the need and awareness to reduce building's energy is essential. One of the simple methods that can be used to prevent the high consumption of energy in buildings is by using natural and passive cooling systems. It uses non-mechanical techniques to maintain a comfortable indoor temperature. Shading is one of the passive design methods, which block the sun light before it hit the building surfaces. Shading reduces the solar radiation and it cools the building surface effectively, hence reducing the building energy performance significantly. This paper will discuss a study of bricks design facade that can be used to shade its own surfaces. The design configuration of the brick will provide self-shading system, that could help reduce the energy consumption in the buildings. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

One of them is during the early phases of the design process, where the architects or designers try to interpret the project brief into the design concept. This paper is a report of the procedure of digital tools in the early design process in an architectural practice in Jakarta. It targets principally the use of BIM and digital modeling to generate information and transform them into conceptual forms, which is not very common in Indonesian architectural practices. Traditionally, the project brief is transformed into conceptual forms by using sketches, drawings, and physical model. The new method using digital tools shows that it is possible to do the same thing during the initial stage of the design process to create early architectural design forms. Architect's traditional tools and methods begin to be replaced effectively by digital tools, which would drive bigger opportunities for innovation. © 2017 Author(s).",,,,,,,"(2013) RIBA Plan of Work 2013, , RIBA, ISBN: 978-1 85946 5196; Asanowicz, A., (2002) Sixth Design and Decision Support Systems in Architecture and Urban Planning - Part One: Architecture Proceedings Edited by Timmermans, pp. 35-37. , Harry (Avegoor, The Netherlands); Asanowicz, A., (2012) Digital Aids to Design Creativity, 2, pp. 263-270. , eCAADe 30.2; Cannaerts, C., (2009) Proceedings of the Design Modelling Symposium (Berlin); Dorta, T., (2005) Digital Design: The Quest for New Paradigms, 23 ECAADe Conference Proceedings, pp. 819-827. , ISBN: 0-9541183-3-2 (Technical University of Lisbon, Lisbon)","Prawata, A.G.; Bina Nusantara University, Jl.

The planning establishment of the government is based on capital-intensive strategic actions, so they can shape the urban spaces according to a certain set of values. These values are clearly made in the patterns of resource consumption. However, they often create a hierarchical gap between the people and the communities. In the city, the economy becomes the basis of how the urban spaces are shaped and created. New economic activities often have an impact of degrading the quality of the spaces. As a result, the city will lose its attractions, they become aesthetically unpleasant, and people feel alienated. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the interaction and appreciation of creative users and the citizens of the city towards urban spaces, and how this will encourage endless collaboration amongst local citizens to create thoughtful and meaningful designs for the public. The discussion and arguments will be based on some creative movements such as ‘Park(ing) Day.’ It has the importance to be a city icon and become an urban fabric that supports the city, becoming a part of the sustainable city concept. The engagement and ideas from the creative user can be a strong foundation for creative urbanism that has the power to re-shape the city spaces to be more liveable. Therefore, it can also bring a new identity and vibrant atmosphere to a certain area as well as to the city. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","Creative; Creative user; Park(ing) day; Urban spaces","Building materials; Economics; Regional planning; Creative; Creative user; Economic activities; Government IS; Resource consumption; Sustainable cities; Urban fabrics; Urban spaces; Urban planning",,,,,"Baker, L., WalkingWins Out.

Automatic vehicle detection and license plate recognition are employed to detect the traffic violation. To automatically detect the vehicle, Tiny-DSOD object detection is utilized, which has been proven for real-time performance. Then, Tiny-DSOD and WPOD-NET are combined to detect the unconstrained license plate with better performance and accuracy. Finally, a novel license plate recognition network is introduced to detect the characters in the license plate. Those methods are integrated into a web-based system to detect traffic violations in real time automatically. Experimental results show the performance of each module in the proposed system. The proposed DSWPOD-NET is confirmed to have less parameter and higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art WPOD-NET due to integration between Tiny-DSOD backend and WPOD license plate detector. © 2020 ICIC International.

Moreover, the current rapid development of mobile technology multiplies the efforts to test software in varying mobile devices. This challenge drives many researchers to implement automated testing that would increase efficiency of resource usage. The first stage of automated testing is to generate and optimize test cases automatically. Test case could be generated from requirement artifacts such as UML diagram to provide test case on early phase of software development process. There are two approaches to optimize the generated test case, by using mathematical or computational approach. This research aims to implement test case generation from combinational UML diagram and optimize the test case by using genetic algorithm. Simple example of login case is provided to simulate the proposed method. The experimental result of this paper proved that genetic algorithm implementation is able to optimize generated test paths by showing the fitness value. © 2019, ICIC International.

Some of social media web applications, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, even provide user with an easy information sharing features. However, the information is presented in the form of a timeline or a feed, which is sometimes not relevant to the user or quite hard to accessed by user because of the redundancy of the information. This situation can be resolved with a Web Scraping method proposed in this paper, that able to search information, combine and present it in a better way according to user preferences. A system is developed to implement the proposed method by using an API that Facebook Developers and Twitter Developers provided. In addition, regular expression (or Regex) which is a language construction that can be used for matching text by using some patterns. Based on experiment conducted in this research, overload information could be suppressed into structure data that store in a database, less redundancy information is presented, and information relevancy could be adjusted to user preferences. © 2019 The Authors.

However, testing process is a time-consuming activity that requires good planning and a lot of resources. Therefore, technique and methodology for predicting the testing effort is important process prior the testing process to significantly increase efficiency of time, effort and cost usage. Correspond to software metric usage for measuring software quality, software metric can be used to identify the faulty modules in software. Furthermore, implementing machine learning technique will allow computer to 'learn' and able to predict the fault prone modules. Research in this field has become a hot issue for more than ten years ago. However, considering the high importance of software quality with support of machine learning methods development, this research area is still being highlighted until this year. In this paper, a survey of various software metric used for predicting software fault by using machine learning algorithm is examined. According to our review, this is the first study of software fault prediction that focuses to PROMISE repository dataset usage. Some conducted experiments from PROMISE repository dataset are compared to contribute a consensus on what constitute effective software metrics and machine learning method in software fault prediction. © 2017 IEEE.","machine learning algorithm; software defect prediction; Software metric; software testing","Artificial intelligence; Computer software selection and evaluation; Forecasting; Learning systems; Life cycle; Software design; Software testing; Fault-prone modules; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Machine learning techniques; Software defect prediction; Software development life cycle; Software fault prediction; Software metrices; Learning algorithms",,,,,,"Kumar, L., Krishna, S., Sureka, A., Ku, S., Effective fault prediction model developed using Least (2017) Square Support; Kumudha, P., Venkatesan, R., Cost-sensitive radial basis function neural network classifier for software (2016) Defect Prediction, 2016; Malhotra, R., Jain, A., Fault prediction using statistical and machine learning methods for improving software quality (2012) J.

Software size is used to estimate schedule, effort, cost and other resource in software development process. Therefore, the best method to measure software size is to derive software attributes from requirement artifacts to get early estimation. UML sequence diagram chose as source to extract software function, since this diagram provide high level granularity of function. Functional size is measured by using COSMIC method, while structural size is calculated based on control structure on sequence diagram. To automate the measurement process, XML structure of sequence diagram is analyzed to fit existing functional and structural equation.

The low-cost EEG can record EEG data, but it performs significantly worse than the medical device. The purpose of our research is to understand the way of images are perceived by people based on their brain waves. Based on the EEG, we investigate two paradigms in mind-brain research that is: the valence-arousal plane and the universal symbol. The experiments are done using two paradigms to generate EEG data based on visual stimuli and convert it into spectrogram. For brainwave response classification based on EEG spectrogram, we use the recent deep learning architecture that is DenseNet. Furthermore, we compare the training performance between two brain-mind paradigms. The experiment results show that: (i) the EEG signal classification of visual stimuli based on valence-arousal model framework is not reliable, (ii) the universal symbol paradigm gives a promising result in generating visual stimuli for brainwave response classification based on low-cost EEG data. © 2018 The Authors.

The mobile device Graphical user interfaces (GUI) are one of the main components to be tested for quality assurance. GUI testing is important since they often make up for half of the resource code of the application and GUI is used to interact with the application. Automating these tests is very useful since it saves a lot of time and money. However, the tools or frameworks that are available for automating the tests are often not suitable for developer needs, mainly because of the lack of functionality. Therefore, automated testing framework evaluation is needed. With a comparison study provided, developers will able to consider about testing framework that can fit their needs easily. In this study, we selected top 4 most used Android GUI testing frameworks that will be evaluated by using experimental study. Those frameworks are: Espresso, Appium, Calabash and UI Automator.

They need communication tools to facilitate communication activities with others. The purpose of this research is to create an application that translates thoughts to text which will be implemented in SMS feature by taking raw EEG from Emotiv EPOC, filtering, and applying machine learning algorithm, which is Support Vector Machine. There are two research steps: Analysis and implementation. In the analysis step, the EEG samples taken from respondents are used for analyzing the most dominant channel. Then, EEG signal extraction uses Emotiv EPOC SDK, filters EEG signal taken from the most dominant channel and applies SVM algorithm for data training. C# based UI application is used as interactive media, so user can see the extraction result.

This condition is getting worse in 2016 with significant increase of private vehicle number in Jakarta. In order to tackle this problem, current Jakarta’s governor stated that the only working theory to dissolve the congestion in Jakarta is to make people willing to commute using public transportation. However, there is no integrated system to facilitate and navigate the usage of public transportation in Jakarta. In order to help the government to encourage people to use the public transportation, an integrated public transportation system is developed. On the first development phase, this system will integrate two main public transportations in Jakarta: Train KRL and bus TransJa-karta. Greedy best first search algorithm is implemented to calculate fastest route information. Routes, direction, current location and others real time information is provided by using Google Map service. Some alternative routes based on cost, distance and time will be shown to facilitate user preferable. The system is developed for three main platforms: Website, android, and iOS to cover user’s usage diversity in Jakarta. Based on survey conducted on the last phase on development cycle, 90 percent of respondent says that the navigation information is accurate. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.

The ability to control ourselves not eating emotionally is a crucial aspect for our health. We present a simple and novel approach for detecting physical or emotional hunger using Bayesian belief networks and psychological aspects. A novel approach is proposed where the user asks whether he/she is thirsty, then some action should be done such as drinking and answering some questions, and the result and suggestion are then displayed. Bayesian belief networks use 3 nodes: thirsty, mood and social media to improve the accuracy of hunger prediction. A hunger and discovery scale concept as parameter of the output is used. This Android app is very useful for people to avoid emotional hunger. Based on the experiment, concept of physical and emotional hunger can apply the application able to show the prediction of his/her hunger. © 2017 ICIC International.","Bayesian belief network; Emotional eating; Hunger detection; Intuitive eating",,,,,"Binus University","The authors wish to thank to BINUS University for supporting this research.

Classic research in psychology found that stability of marriage is based on the ability to create and maintain a positive interaction ratio five times more than negative interactions. Based on that, we present Counselove, a mobile application intended to record information of daily positive behaviors (joking, showing affection) of couples who use the application. We propose a method where the apps can determine users' marital satisfaction level and also can help users increasing their marital satisfaction based on the relationship satisfaction questionnaire and the assessment of user's self reported behaviors to their partners using fuzzy logic. The experimental results shown the application is running well on mobile devices based on Android platform. Lastly, we provide result of in depth interview with two users.

However, the testing process is consuming activities that need to be automated to save a lot of resources. Towards automated testing, automating test cases generation as the first testing process is being highlighted. This research aims to generate test case automatically from UML diagram since model based testing that conducted on early phase of software development process show higher efficiency. UML diagrams used in this research are activity diagram, sequence diagram and SYTG as the combination graph. These three diagrams have been proved as the most compatible diagram to generate test case from previous research. Method proposed in this paper is Depth First Search algorithm that is modified to generate expected test cases. This paper proves that modified DFS algorithm applied to generate test case is provide accurate result, every node presented on the test case, include any condition (alt and opt). Comparison result from three different test cases generated shows that test cases from combined UML may not necessarily result in better test cases, due to the possibility of redundant test cases for some test cases. This paper also presenting an experiment result that proving sequence diagrams can produce better test cases.","depth first search algorithm; software testing; test cases; test cases generator; UML diagram","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Computer software; Computer software selection and evaluation; Learning algorithms; Model checking; Software design; Software engineering; Testing; Automated test case generation; Depth first search algorithms; Model based testing; Software development process; Test case; Test cases generation; UML activity diagrams; UML diagrams; Software testing",,,,,,"Hanthi, V.K., MohanKumar, G., A Novel Approach for Automated Test Path Generation using TABU Search Algorithm (2012) International Journal of Computer Applications, 48 (13), pp. 28-34; Srivastaval, J., Dwivedi, T., (2015) Software Testing Strategy Approach on Source Code Applying, 6 (3), pp. 25-31; Alazzam, I., Alsmadi, I., Akour, M., (2014) Test Cases Selection Based on Source Code Features Extraction, 8 (1), pp. 203-214; Tripathy, A., Mitra, A., Test case generation using activity diagram and sequence diagram (2013) Proceedings of International Conference on Advances in Computing, pp. 121-129. , Springer; Faria, J.P., Paiva, A.C.R., Yang, Z., Test generation from UML sequence diagrams (2012) Proceedings - 2012 8th International Conference on the Quality of Information and Communications Technology, QUATIC, 2012, pp. 245-250; Swain, R.K., Panthi, V., Behera, P.K., (2013) Generation of Test Cases Using Activity Diagram; Panthi, V., (2012) Automatic Test Case Generation Using Sequence Diagram, 2 (4), pp. 22-29; Hettab, A., Chaoui, A., Aldahoud, A., (2013) Automatic Test Cases Generation from Uml Activity Diagrams Using Graph; Sumalatha, V.M., Object Oriented Test Case Generation Technique using Genetic Algorithms (2013) International Journal of Computer Applications, 61 (20); Asad, S., Shah, A., Shahzad, R.K., Shafique, S., Bukhari, A., Humayun, M., (2016) Automated Test Case Generation Using UML Class & Sequence Diagram, 15 (3), pp. 1-12; Khurana, N., Chillar, R.S., Test Case Generation and Optimization using UML Models and Genetic Algorithm (2015) Procedia Computer Science [Internet], 57, pp. 996-1004. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2015.07.502","Meiliana; Computer Science Department, Jl.

That reason makes Indonesia becoming a place that is interesting to be visited by many tourists either local or international. Every year the number of tourists who visited Indonesia has greatly increased1,2 and transformed the tourism to be an important sector for Indonesia economical. The rapid development of tourism sector in Indonesia must be equilibrated by the evolution of technology and the supported facilities. Now, the usage of a smartphone technology is one of the important things and a part of modern people daily activities. By taking the advantages of a smartphone, this study is conducted to develop an android application that is named Smart Travelling. Smart travelling has many features that can facilitate every tourist who visited Indonesia, such as recognizes any tourist attractions, shows any events that nearby visited attractions, displays the nearest police station and hospital for an emergency case, and saves the history of the recognized objects. The main idea of the tourist attractions recognition here is to implement an image recognition using landmark detection feature from Google Cloud Vision Application Program Interface (API)3 technology which helps the tourist to easily remember and access any information regarding the visited attractions. In this study, the result is a completed application which is evaluated using questionnaires to 35 randomly selected participants. Based on the evaluation, the smart travelling achieves positive inputs and mostly the participants agree that the image recognition feature is really helping them. Furthermore, we also obtained a significant result for the scan landmark testing, which is 86% for the accuracy. © 2017 The Authors.

This purpose can be done by embedding speech and face recognition ability on specific tasks to the robot. In this research, we would like to propose Intelligent Coffee Maker Robot which the speech recognition is based on Indonesian language and powered by statistical dialogue systems. This kind of robot can be used in the office, supermarket or restaurant. In our scenario, robot will recognize user's face and then accept commands from the user to do an action, specifically in making a coffee. Based on our previous work, the accuracy for speech recognition is about 86% and face recognition is about 93% in laboratory experiments. The main problem in here is to know the intention of user about how sweetness of the coffee. The intelligent coffee maker robot should conclude the user intention through conversation under unreliable automatic speech in noisy environment. In this paper, this spoken dialog problem is treated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We describe how this formulation establish a promising framework by empirical results. The dialog simulations are presented which demonstrate significant quantitative outcome. © 2016 SPIE.","Coffee maker; Face recognition; POMDP; Service robot; Speech recognition; Spoken dialog problem","Face recognition; Intelligent robots; Markov processes; Mobile robots; Pattern recognition; Robots; Speech; Speech processing; Face recognition systems; In-laboratory experiments; Intelligent Service robots; Partially observable Markov decision process; POMDP; Recognition abilities; Service robots; Spoken dialog problem; Speech recognition",,,,,,"(2012), http://www.ifr.org/service-robots; Pieska, S., Luimula, M., Jauhiainen, J., Spiz, V., Social service robots in wellness and restaurant applications (2013) Journal of Communication and Computer, 10, pp. 116-123; Graf, B., Parlitz, C., Hagele, M., Robotic home assistant care-o-bot® 3 product vision and innovation platform (2009) Human-Computer Interaction, Part II, HCII 2009, LNCS 5611, , Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg; (2010) Restaurant Service Robot FURO-R, , http://www.futurerobot.com/contents_eng/sub42.htm; Budiharto, W., Gunawan, S.A.A., Ngarianto, H., Designing of humanoid robot with voice recognition capability (2015) ICISIP, , Fukuoka-Japan; Nakadai, K., Nakajima, H., Hasegawa, Y., Tsujino, H., Sound source separation of moving speakers for robot audition (2009) IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, pp. 3685-3688; Williams, J.D., Young, S., Partially observable Markov decision processes for spoken dialog systems (2007) Journal Computer Speech and Language, 21 (2), pp. 393-422; Young, S., Gašić, M., Thomson, B., Williams, J.D., POMDP-based statistical spoken dialog systems: A review (2013) Proceedings of the IEEE, 101 (5), pp. 1160-1179; Fox, D., Thrun, S., Burgard, W., (2006) Probabilistic Robotics, , MIT Press; Gorin, A.L., Riccardi, G., Wright, J.H., How may i Help You?

Therefore, it is a must to manage the documents. Automatic text summarization is able to solve by producing text document summaries. The goal of the research is to produce a tool to summarize documents in Bahasa: Indonesian Language. It is aimed to satisfy the user’s need of relevant and consistent summaries. The algorithm is based on sentence features scoring by using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Genetic Algorithm for determining sentence feature weights. It is evaluated by calculating summarization speed, precision, recall, F-measure, and some subjective evaluations. Extractive summaries from the original text documents can represent important information from a single document in Bahasa with faster summarization speed compared to manual process. Best F-measure value is 0,556926 (with precision of 0.53448 and recall of 0.58134) and summary ratio of 30%. © 2014, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

We assume that this model of humanoid robot is used as a service robot to deliver a cup to customer from starting point to destination point. We have successfully developed and introduced three main modules to recognize faces, to identify multiple moving obstacles and to initiate a maneuver. A group of people who are walking will be tracked as multiple moving obstacles. Predefined maneuver to avoid obstacles is applied to robot because the limitation of view angle from stereo camera to detect multiple obstacles. The contribution of this research is a new method for multiple moving obstacles avoidance strategy with Bayesian approach using stereo vision based on the direction and speed of obstacles. Depth estimation is used to obtain distance calculation between obstacles and the robot. We present the results of the experiment of the humanoid robot called Gatotkoco II which is used our proposed method and evaluate its performance. The proposed moving obstacles avoidance strategy was tested empirically and proved effective for humanoid robot. © 2013 Licensee InTech.","Bayesian approach; Humanoid service robot; Obstacles avoidance; Stereo vision","Bayesian approaches; Destination points; Distance calculation; Humanoid service robot; Indoor environment; Moving obstacles; Multiple moving obstacles; Obstacles avoidance; Bayesian networks; Mobile robots; Stereo vision; Anthropomorphic robots",,,,,,"Acosta, L., González, E.J., Rodríguez, J.N., Hamilton, A.F., Méndez, J.A., Hernéndez, S., Sigut, S.M., Marichal, G.N., Design and implementation of a service robot for a restaurant (2006) International Journal of Robotics and Automation., 21 (4), pp. 273-281; Qing-Wiau, Y., Can, Y., Zhuang, F., Yan-Zheng, Z., Research of the localization of restaurant service robot (2010) International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems., 7 (3), pp. 227-238; Maier, D., Self-supervised obstacle detection for humanoid navigation using monocular vision and sparse laser data (2011) IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation., pp. 1263-1269; Masako, K., Daisu, K., Autonomous mobile robot navigation using active stereo vision (2000) Intelligent Autonomous Systems 6., pp. 1041-1048. , IOS Press; Purwanto, D., (2001) Visual Feedback Control in Multi-Degrees-of-Freedom Motion System., , PhD thesis at Graduate School of Science and Technology-Keio University, Japan; Etemad, K., Chellappa, R., Discriminant analysis for recognition of human face images (1997) Journal of the Optical Society of America A: Optics and Image Science, and Vision, 14 (8), pp. 1724-1733; Belhumeur, P.N., Kriegman, D.J., What Is the Set of Images of an Object under All Possible Illumination Conditions?

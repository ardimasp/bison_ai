Astra Credit Company (ACC) is one of automotive financing service provider which has already applied IT. As a big company, the large scale of the utilization of IT in ACC also raised the need for managing the IT Helpdesk. Currently ACC already uses an application to support IT Helpdesk business process called IT Care. But as the development of business process and the changing needs of the company, the system is no longer able to support business process needs. Based on those needs this research was conducted to develop system design that can meet current business needs. Design and analysis process done through System Development Life Cycle methodology with Object Oriented Analysis and Design approach using Unified Model Language diagram. System analysist and design activities developed several processes i.e. Chart Of Account management based with time estimation, ticket submission, ticket assignment with consideration of staff balancing work load, completion ticket based on priority, also reporting of IT staff performance and ticket completion. Conclusions from the results of the analysis and design of IT Care systems are a proposed IT Care system design that is expected to overcome the problems in the existing IT Care system. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Balancing; Competition; Human resource management; Life cycle; Object oriented programming; Systems analysis; Account management; Business competition; Business Process; Design and analysis; Design information; Object oriented analysis and design; System development life cycles; Unified modeling language diagrams; Design",,,,,"Satzinger, J.W., Burd, S.D., Jackson, R.B., (2012) Introduction to Systems Analysis and Design: An Agile, Iterative Approach, , Course Technology, Cengage Learning; Tegarden, D.P., Dennis, A., Wixom, B.H., (2012) Systems Analysis and Design with UML, , (John Wiley amp; Sons, Inc.); Omarsson, G.I., (2010) Knowledge Management in An IT-Help Desk Environment; Purwanto, I., (2011) Seminar Nasional Aplikasi Teknologi Informasi, , (SNATI) Desain Sistem Help Desk Troubleshooting Hardware Dan Software Online June; Bansode, J., Visaria, R., Varhadi, A., Patania, D., Software Development for IT Service Help Desk (2015) International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication, 3 (2), pp. 852-855; Bertram, D., Voida, A., Greenberg, S., Walker, R., (2009) Communication, Collaboration, and Bugs: The Social Nature of Issue Tracking in Software Engineering, , (University of Calgary); Connolly, T., Begg, C., Database Systems (2005) A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation & Management"" Addison Wesley; Connolly, R., (2015) Fundamentals of Web Development, , (Pearson Education); Coronel, C., Morris, S., (2016) Database Systems: Design, Implementation, & Management, , (Cengage Learning); Bansode, J., Visaria, R., Varhadi, A., Patania, D., Software Development for IT Service Help Desk (2015) International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication, 3 (2), pp. 852-855; Mustopa, A., (2017) Sistem Informasi It-help Deskpada Universitas Amikom Yogyakarta Berbasis Web.

Implementation model of enterprise architecture framework in e-commerce usually work successfully, but in some enterprise since the model of enterprise architecture has been applied, companies seeing the lack of alignment between business and technology designed, so companies need to find solutions for fixing the problems. One of the purposes of this literature review is to analyze the components of enterprise architecture framework to support business processes with technology of e-commerce system. This study uses a systematic literature review method, step of search process reviewing various sources of databases by using keywords related to the topic of research, and the data obtained is classified based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. There are 117 papers identified with the topic research, then selected into 50 papers to review. The research result finds six components of enterprise architecture framework is the most influential in the development of e-commerce systems, which are business, system, design, technology, service, and people. © 2017 IEEE.","Component; Ecommerce; Enterprise architecture framework; Systematic literature review.","Commerce; Electronic commerce; Search engines; Component; E-commerce systems; Enterprise Architecture; Implementation models; Inclusion and exclusions; Literature reviews; Online transaction; Systematic literature review; Computer architecture",,,,,"Stephan, A., Saat, J., Understanding processes for model-based enterprise transformation planning (2011) International Journal of Internet and Enterprise Management, 7 (1), pp. 84-103; Barbara, K., (2004) Procedure for Performing Systematic Reviews.

The questionnaires were distributed online through GoogleDocs application and also distributed by papers to the 100 respondents who had experienced on purchasing movie ticket through website. The results had indicated that there was a significant influence of e-marketing and the lifestyle of consumers on movie ticket purchasing decisions. Thus, the variables of emarketing and consumer lifestyles had significance influence on consumer decision making-style.

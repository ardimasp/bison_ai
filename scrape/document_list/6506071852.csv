The paper seeks to explore and understand the drivers of P2P lending sectors in Indonesia and to determine the challenges faced by the peer-to-peer lending sector in Indonesia by analyzing the three perspectives of this sector: users (lenders & borrowers), businesses, and regulator. A qualitative approach is used to collect and analyze data. The data is collected through open-ended and in-depth interviews with users, companies and government agency. A thematic analysis method using code mapping was developed during data analysis. The finding shows different results, from the regulator’s perspective, business lending users’ and borrowers’ views. Business opportunity and platform convenience are the drivers, policy risks and lending system are the challenges. The paper concludes there is still a potential sector in an early stage of development. Many improvements can be done through regulations, businesses approach (i.e., policy), and user participation in supporting small businesses. The findings found that OJK might be one party that has planned far in the future of P2P lending, such as the planning of users’ data privacy regulations, and regulations for P2P lending businesses that will not be too strict and still supports its innovation and development. Thus, with such changes, there could be more drivers and challenges in the future that can be explored.

This study has utilised closed-ended questionnaires with a five-point Likert scale distributed to several traders and middlemen of broiler chickens in the traditional town market in Semarang City of Central Java Province. One hundred and twenty-five copies of the questionnaire were administered to the traders of broiler chickens in these marketplaces: North Johar, Central Johar, South Johar, Bulu, Karangayu, Peterongan, and Jatingaleh. Additional information was collected through follow-up telephone interviews and archive records. Data acquired from the questionnaire were processed using structural equation modelling (SEM). The findings indicate that the transaction cost economy and the collaborative advantage have a significant positive effect on the level of integration; in this case, the effect of the transaction cost economics is stronger than that of collaboration advantages. The findings also suggest that the transaction cost economics significantly depends on uncertain conditions between traders and the middlemen; whereas, the collaborative advantage significantly depends on uncertain conditions and collaboration capability.

The game uses a simple supply chain structure incorporating three entities of the supply chain: supplier, plant, and customer. The game employs a set of toy building blocks such as LEGO blocks and has the rules of the game, responsibility of each player, product descriptions and bill of materials. This competitive game is used supply chain cost as the measuring to determine the winner team of the game and the Bloom's taxonomy as guidelines to develop the assessment testing based on the learning objectives of courses. This proposed board game has been tested by many undergraduate students who are taking SCM and Logistics Management courses. The results show that the students who played the game reached the higher scores of assessment testing than students who didn't play the game. Furthermore, most students have also positive view about this game.

Existing inventory models incorporate the parameters (e.g., mean and standard deviation) of these statistical quantities to formulate inventory policies. In practice, only sample estimates of these parameters are available. The estimates are subject to sampling variation and hence are random variables. Whereas the effect of sampling variability on estimates of parameters are in general well known in statistics literature, literature on inventory control policies has largely ignored the potential effect of sampling variation on the validity of the inventory models. This paper investigates the theoretical effect of sampling variability and develops theoretically sound inventory models that can be effectively used in different inventory policies.

Central to our conceptualisation is a two-dimensional framework constructed by supplier capability levels (low, medium, and high) and customer outsourcing needs (market, relational, and partnership). A match between supplier capability levels and customer outsourcing needs is posited to be the key to a sustainable relationship between suppliers and their customers. Attaining this match may often require suppliers to either upgrade or acquire new capabilities. The resources, efforts, and strategies needed toward this end are evaluated.

Despite the importance of supplier performance in new product development (NPD), most research has focused on supplier performance in operations. Few studies have focused on how product development practices of an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) influence OEM evaluations of supplier performance. This paper posits a model of the relationships among three factions: OEM practices that involve suppliers in design, concurrent engineering practices of the OEM and OEM assessments of supplier performance. This model is tested and cross-validated using a sample of 406 NPD projects in Germany and the United States. The findings suggest that NPD practices of OEMs influence their perceptions of suppliers' performance.

Success measurement in product development has emphasized end-result measures of overall project performance or economic value. The product development literature has largely ignored process performance (i.e., the measurement of how effectively the product development process is actually working). Process performance may be an early warning signal of downstream problems in a project's quality, time, or productivity. This paper proposes a model of process performance at the project level during product and process engineering. The model suggests that process performance mediates the influence of concurrent engineering (process choice) on overall project development performance. This process performance model is tested in the automobile industry using a sample of 406 product development projects in Germany and the USA. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Automotive industry; Germany; Process efficiency; Process planning; Product development;

Central to our conceptualization is a two-dimensional framework constructed by supplier capability levels (low, medium, and high) and customer outsourcing needs (market, relational, and partnership). A match between supplier capability levels and customer outsourcing needs is posited to be the key to a mutually beneficial, stable relationship between supplier and customer firms. Attaining this match may often require suppliers to either upgrade or acquire new capabilities. The resources, efforts, and strategies needed toward this end are evaluated.",,"Marketing; Outsourcing; Scheduling; Strategic planning; Customer outsourcing needs; Supplier capability levels; Inventory control",,,,,,,"Kim, Ken I.; Univ of Toledo, Toledo, United States","Anon",,"Decis Sci Inst, Atlanta, GA, United States","Proceedings of the 1997 Annual Meeting of the Decision Sciences Institute.

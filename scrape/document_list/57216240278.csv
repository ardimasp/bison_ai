The proposed method to modify ANFIS with Fuzzy C-Means Clustering (FCM) approach is applied to detect four typical kinds of faults that may happen in the e-banking system, which are application response times, transaction per second, server utilization and network performance. Input data is obtained from the e-banking monitoring results throughout 2017 that become data training and data testing. The study shows that an ANFIS modeling with FCM optimized input has a RMSE 0.006 and increased accuracy by 1.27% compared to ANFIS without FCM optimization.

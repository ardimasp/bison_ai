XYZ begins from 2014 was already starting and also aware of the importance of Knowledge Management System (KMS) in the internal company. So that XYZ develop Wiki Knowledge Management System (KMS) with the name is KB SRIN. From the total employee SRIN from 2014 until 2016, still a few employees who use and contribute in KB SRIN. That is impact to dependence with other employee. The purpose of this research was to determine the model that can describe the factors that influence user acceptance of the Knowledge Management System (KMS) in PT XYZ, and then the recommendations can be given to support the achievement of user acceptance. The method used in this study is Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) with a model Technology Acceptance Model 2 (TAM2). The result showed that the factors that influence user acceptance are the voluntariness, subjective norms, individual factors, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of contributing, attitude towards using, intention to use KMS and actual system use. Recommendations contained in three main areas, namely the support of management, and content management system, the maintenance of KB SRIN. © 2018 IEEE.","Knowledge Management System; PLS-SEM; TAM2","Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Least squares approximations; Personnel; Telecommunication services; Content management system; Individual factors; Knowledge management system; Modeling technology; Partial least square (PLS); Perceived usefulness; Structural equation modeling; TAM2; Knowledge management",,,,,"Kristin, D.M., Evaluasi knowledge management system di kompas gramedia menggunakan analisis faktor (2013) ComTech, 4 (1), pp. 151-161; Hariningsih, E., Studi Kesuksesan Knowledge Management System di Pendidikan Tinggi (2008) Simposium Nasional Sistem Teknologi Informasi (SNSTI) Universitas Gajah Mada, , 27-28 Januari, Yogyakarta, 2008; Nasseef, O.A., The role of organizational influence on improving knowledge management systems (kms) acceptance (2012) Egyptian Computer Science Journal ,ECS, 36 (4). , https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258108948_The_Role_of_Organizational_Influence_on_Improving_Knowledge-Management-Systems-KMS-Acceptance, Retrieved Juni 19, 2016, from; Assegaff, S., Pre-adoption of kms: User acceptance from knowledge worker prespective (2016) International Conference on Innovation, Management and Technology Research (ICIMTR2012)ICIMTR2012), Malacca, Malaysia, , https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232273048_Pre-Adoption_of_KMS_User_Acceptance_from_Knowledge_Worker-Perspectives, 2012; Hossain, M.M., Student acceptance of knowledge management systems: Evidence from a canadian business school International Journal of Business and Management, 8 (12); Prasetya, W.Y., Exploring the roles of personality factors on knowledge management system acceptance 3rd International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT); Fajar, A.N., Budiardjo, E.K., Hasibuan, Z.A., System architecture in dynamic environment based on commonality and variability business processes (2012) 8th ICCM Seoul, , IEEE, Seoul; Fajar, A.N., Shofi, I.M., Goal model to business process model: A methodology for enterprise government tourism system development International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 6 (6), pp. 3031-3036",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","6th International Conference on Cyber and IT Service Management, CITSM 2018","7 August 2018 through 9 August 2018",,146692,,9781538654330,,,"English","Int.

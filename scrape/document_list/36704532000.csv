Increasing the number of digital music content every month conduce a lot of song catalog data and becoming unstructured and making it difficult for users to choose the songs they want to listen to. To make it easier for users to optimize a large number of subscribed music catalogs, a user-centric music recommendation system is needed that allows users to be able to manage catalogs of digital music content according to their needs. This study examines how to implement song recommendation system using collaborative filtering method in digital online music. This study uses 20,000 users, 6,000 songs and 470,000 transactions rating. Through those research, it is discovered that user-based collaborative technique that could make one system for clients will gather those playlist they really want to hear. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery","Collaborative filtering; Digital music; Playlist generation; Recommendation","E-learning; Educational technology; Recommender systems; Catalog data; Collaborative filtering methods; Collaborative technique; Digital music; Music Recommendation System; Playlist generation; Recommendation; User-centric; Collaborative filtering",,,,"Binus University: 23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019","This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia, as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University titled “Pengembangan Sistem Rekomendasi Lagu Menggunakan Neural Collaboartive Filtering” or “Song Recommendation System Development Using Neural Collaborative Filtering” with contract number: 23/AKM/MONOPNT/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","Zheng, E., Kondo, G.Y., Zilora, S., Yu, Q., Tag-aware dynamic music recommendation (2018) Expert Syst.

Particularly in case of automotive industry, to select the most appropriate personal vehicle is challenging for the customers. The challenge was taken as a main problem of this study. In this research, the reasonableness is characterized by the customer parameters which portray the customer's identity. By utilizing the mix technique for fuzzy-logic and Euclidean distance calculation, the customer's identities are fitted into the personal-vehicle parameters. At long last, the constructed model for choosing personal vehicle plays several customer's parameters; e.g., age, gender, education, income and job. The model designed thru utilizing the object-oriented methodology. The result of simulation of 66 purchasers and 44 conceivable vehicles are able to propose the most reasonable vehicle for every purchaser. As an extended version, the model successfully delivers the completed scheme due to added parameters and method. It is a truthful contribution provided by this research. © 2019 Calvin Chang, Edwin and Ditdit Nugeraha Utama.","Euclidean distance; Fitness model; Fuzzy logic; Personal vehicle selection",,,,,,"We would like to thank Bina Nusantara University who has supported and sponsored our studies and works, particularly Bina Nusantara Graduate Program, Master of Computer Science.","Abubakar, A.M., Elrehail, H., Alatailat, M.A., Elçi, A., Knowledge management, decision-making style and organizational performance (2019) J.

Puzzles in the escape room traditionally have disadvantages because the type of puzzle that is made requires a lot of material. The purpose of this research is to produce a game with Escape Room as the basic theme with Virtual Reality technology. Virtual Reality technology is used to develop presence in users, attendance is about the intimacy of users with the gaming world. By using Virtual Reality, the puzzle elements that are created can be replaced regularly without the need to change the building's skeleton. The development method used is a prototype model using Unity game machines. The research method was carried out using a questionnaire for user analysis. The application generated from this research is the Escape Room VR game that can be played on an Android smartphone that is compatible with Samsung Gear VR. The application can be used as an additional means for traditional Escape Room games. © 2019 The Authors.

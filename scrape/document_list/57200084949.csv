Competitive advantage has become a major concern for companies in today's global market, especially the chemical industry. Based on an analysis of past research, there has been no research investigating information technology, strategic leadership, and overall knowledge management of competitive advantage in the context of chemical companies in Indonesia. Furthermore, the novelty of this research is to examine the relationship between information technology, leadership, and knowledge management on the competitive advantage in a research model. This study uses a quantitative method with a research population of chemical companies in Indonesia, total 1519 companies and a sample of 114 companies. The sampling technique uses an intentional sampling method, and the data analysis uses multiple regression analysis with SPPS 25. The results of this study indicate that information technology, strategic leadership, and knowledge management have a significant positive relationship with a competitive advantage. The implications of this study indicate that a manager's leadership strategy ability and the application of knowledge management for employees in this industry significantly influence competitive advantage. The use of information technology for strategic purposes should be more widely applied to increase competitive advantage. © 2020 IEEE.","Competitive Advantage; Information technology; Knowledge Management; Strategic Leadership","Chemical analysis; Chemical industry; Competition; Human resource management; International trade; Chemical companies; Competitive advantage; Multiple regression analysis; Quantitative method; Research models; Sampling method; Sampling technique; Strategic leadership; Knowledge management",,,,,,"Pratama, W.P., (2019) Chemical Industry Ready to Compete in Industry Development 4. 0, , https://ekonomi.bisnis.com/read/20190129/257/883700/ChemicalIndustryReadytoCompeteinIndustryDevelopment4.0, Bisnis. com; Siwi, C.C., Massie, J.D., Tumewu, F., An analysis of bankruptcy prediction in manufacturing firm by using bankruptcy models (case study in chemical sub sector listed in Indonesia stock exchange 2013-2017) (2018) J.

Therefore, the higher education institutions demand the lecturers also supporting staff to acquire aligned behaviors in organizational citizenship and knowledge management. This research aims to measure organization citizenship behavior (OCB) and knowledge management behavior (KMB) of supporting staff in a higher education institution. The research was conducted at the Bina Nusantara University, especially supporting staff at Kemanggisan Campus Jakarta. Organizational citizenship behavior as the independent variable is reflected perfectly into five dimensions - altruism, civic virtue, consciousness, courtesy, and sportsmanship. Knowledge management behavior as the dependent variable is reflected perfectly into three dimensions: knowledge creation, knowledge sharing, and knowledge update. The measurement and structural model developed by using SmartPLS explain that OCB has a positive and significant impact on KMB. The results of statistical tests show that female supporting staffs more than five years of service has a higher score in OCB and KMB significantly. © 2020 IEEE.","Demographic characteristics; Human capital; ICT; Knowledge management behavior; Organizational citizenship behavior; Organizational learning; Social web","Behavioral research; Human resource management; Dependent variables; Higher education institutions; Independent variables; Knowledge creations; Knowledge-sharing; Organizational citizenship behaviors; Quality of education; Structural modeling; Knowledge management",,,,,,"Nonaka, I., Toyama, R., The theory of the knowledge-creating firm: Subjectivity, objectivity and synthesis (2005) Ind.

Those include the Banks with category IV. In many cases, the companies recruit the most talented person and continue to initiate training to improve the current resources capabilities and competencies. This research evaluated the impact of the recruitment of a higher level of education person, training costs, and investment of corporate assets, to the performance of the company. This research used secondary longitudinal data in the period between 2011 until 2015. The calculations of data and research model analysis used SPSS version 19 and WarpPLS software. This study concluded that training and asset development had a significant influence on company performance. Therefore, evaluation on training cost allocation to improve the competency and capacity of the company becomes one of the important indicators for the sustainability of the company's performance, especially with today's business disruption by information technology as a key challenge in the bank industry. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Competition; Education; Indonesia Bank Type IV; RBT; Resource development",,,,,,"The authors wish to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika journal team that help in publishing this article.","Ahmadi, S.

It is the attitude toward risk. This study wants to evaluate this variable related to the development of Micro and Small Businesses (MSME) with ICT Adoption. This research will want to see the effect of attitudes on business risk on usage behaviour, on their innovation capacity. The quantitative research method is used to analyse the interview result of traditional small business owners who have limited capital, have a low income and run their businesses. The results of this paper show that there is a new perspective on technology acceptance models.

Not many studies have evaluated the characteristics of company resources that form business models so that they can winagainst competition. Pharmaceutical companies are no exception. Not all of the investments that have been allocated in company activities have a high impact. In this research, we want to test which resources have the most dominant influence on company performance, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. The variables studied were the levels of investment in the company, raw materials, advertising, training, and the number of workers on company performance. The data used are secondary longitudinal data from 5 pharmaceutical companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The results of this study indicate that advertising has the most potent influence on company performance in the pharmaceutical industry.

Large businesses are expected to encourage the growth of micro, small and medium business. However, it turned out that the crisis had stopped the success of Indonesia's economic development, which resulted in many large businesses experiencing bankruptcy and largescale termination of employment. In contrast to large businesses, micro and small businesses recover faster from the crisis, and workers who are affected are absorbed into these micro and small businesses. Speed of recovery of micro and small businesses due to the more flexible nature of the business, relatively small capital, and generally does not depend on imported raw materials and foreign debt. Also, many micro and small businesses have sprung up and have begun to have an important role in Indonesia's national economy. In 2017, micro and small businesses made a stagnant ante to Indonesia GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of 60.34%. Therefore, it is important to maintain the stability of the performance or even improve it. The purpose of this study was to analyse the effect of market orientation, marketing capabilities, and product innovation on the performance of micro and small businesses, especially in West Jakarta. The number of samples is determined using the Slovin formula, which is 270 samples of 835 population, micro and small business people in West Jakarta City who already had a Micro Small Business License. While data collected using a questionnaire it was analysed using SPSS software. The results indicate that the most influential on the business performance is product innovation and followed by marketing capability, then the last is market orientation. © 2019, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Business performance; Market orientation; Marketing capability; Micro and small business; Product innovation",,,,,,"Authors would like to thank respondent who wholeheartedly willing to fill out the questionnaire despite their busy days, support from the SMEs West Jakarta and to our university.","Abbas, D., Pengaruh Modal Usaha, Orientasi Pasar dan Orientasi Kewirausahaan terhadap Kinerja UKM Kota Makassar (2018) Jurnal Manajemen, Ide, Inspirasi (MINDS), 5 (1), pp. 95-111. , (Januari-Juni) 2018; Ali, H., (2013) Marketing dan Kasus-Kasus Pilihan, , Yogyakarta: Center for Academic Publising Servive; Andalan, dan Hikmah, T.R., Faktor-Faktor yang Mempengaruhi Kinerja UMKM Di Kabupaten dan Kota Semarang (2013) E-Jurnal Manajemen Untag, 2 (1), pp. 102-114; Assauri, S., (2007) Manajemen Pemasaran, , Dasar, Konsep dan Strategi.

One of them is a service industry that relies on knowledge-based activities to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. Knowledge workers are employees who increase the value of enterprises by producing, creating, developing, and applying knowledge at work, regardless of their educational background. During their tenure, they are able to solve problems creatively. Knowledge management behaviours are about organizational routine activities. Specifically, a knowledge management behaviour is an individual activity of collecting, managing, applying, sharing and updating knowledge, as a dynamic humanist process. The dimensions of knowledge management behaviours are creating, disseminating, collaborating, learning, applying, strengthening and recycling knowledge. The purpose of this research is to find out the differences among Indonesian knowledge workers in service industries in Jakarta based on demographic factors. A survey of 137 respondents was conducted using a questionnaire as the data collection method. The results show that there is a difference in the knowledge management of Indonesian knowledge workers based on gender. However, there were no differences in knowledge management of Indonesian knowledge workers based on education, tenure and age. © Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Demographic factors; Human resources management; Knowledge management behaviour; Knowledge worker",,,,,,,"Al-Zu'bi, H.A., Organizational Citizenship Behavior and Impacts on Knowledge Sharing: An Empirical Study (2011) International Business Research, 4 (3), pp. 221-227. , https://doi.org/10.5539/ibr.v4n3p221; Aliakbar, E., Yusoff, R.B., Hasnaa, N., Mahmood, N., (2014) Determinants of Knowledge Sharing Behavior Determinants of Knowledge Sharing Behavior, pp. 208-215. , 29(February 2012); Bakhari Ismail, M., Mohammad Yusof, Z., Demographic Factors and Knowledge Sharing Quality among Malaysian Government Officers Communications of the IB IMA Demographic Factors and Knowledge Sharing Quality among Malaysian Government Officers (2009) Communications of the IBIMA, 9, pp. 1-8; Boateng, H., Dzandu, D.M., Agyemang, F.G., The effects of demographic variables on knowledge sharing Article information (2015) Library Review, 64 (3), pp. 216-228; Celep, C., Çetin, B., Teachers' perception about the behaviours of school leaders with regard to knowledge management (2005) International Journal of Educational Management, 19 (2), pp. 102-117. , https://doi.org/10.1108/09513540510582408; Chen, C.J., Huang, J.W., How organizational climate and structure affect knowledge management-The social interaction perspective (2007) International Journal of Information Management, 27 (2), pp. 104-118. , https://doi.Org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2006.ll.001; Chou, S.Y., Ramser, C., A multilevel model of organizational learning: Incorporating employee spontaneous workplace behaviors, leadership capital and knowledge management (2018) Learning Organization, , https://doi.org/10.1108/TLO-10-2018-0168; Chun-Hsien, L., Fang-Pei, N., Chin-Yung, P., Tao-Sheng, C., A Study on the Correlations between Knowledge Sharing Behavior and Organizational Citizenship Behavior in Catering Industry: The Viewpoint of Theory of Planned Behavior (2014) Anthropologist, 17 (3), pp. 873-881; Darroch, J., Developing a measure of knowledge management behaviors and practices (2003) Journal of Knowledge Management, 7 (5), pp. 41-54. , https://doi.org/10.1108/13673270310505377; Dhabi, A., (2018) Role of organisational culture, leadership and organisational citizenship behaviour on knowledge management Amna Ali AlMansouri *.

This research intends to examine the effect of sensing capability (SC) on how logistics service firms-financial performance (LSF-FP) pass through innovative logistics services (ILS). This research used a quantitative method. Data was collected using questionnaires and probability sampling. The sample size consisted of 150 respondents from logistics service firms (LSF) registered as members of Association (ILFA) in the Jakarta (Jabodetabek) region. Unit of observation was constituted by leaders (managers or directors) of the firms. The collected data was analysed by using the SEM-PLS program. This research found that SC had importance role on ILS and financial performance of LSF-FP in Indonesia.

The survey involved 50 presidents of foundations from all over Jakarta and 30 other participants. Content validity was determined via focus group discussion and construct validity using RASCH MODEL approach. The results indicated that the foundations which practised social entrepreneurship tended to be more innovative than those who did not.

Dynamic Capability concept from David Teece, Gary Pisano, and Amy Shuen is in an excellent concept in addressing this situation and became the central of thought in building organization capability to face the competition. Dynamic capabilities took a significant attention from researcher and continue to draw more new concepts and theories. However based on Jeffrey T Macher and David C Mowery, only few researchers focused to the organizational process in developing this capability inside the organizations. Organizational capabilities are built from organizational routines, structures, and processes. It also requires resources, which are available through internal development or acquisition, and lead by a manager or entrepreneurial leader that improve existing routine or create the new ones. The dynamic market forces the organization to explore and exploit the internal and external resources to reach a level of innovation and win the competition. An entrepreneur leader has a high potential to initiate exploitation of internal resources and exploration of external resources, as well as proactively initiate strategic and innovative steps, manage risk, in order to optimize the organization capability and gain competitive advantage. This paper intended to explore a conceptual framework to develop dynamic capabilities in the organization and bring Indonesian Television Industry into the discussion of industrial dynamic competition. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

It uses a descriptive-qualitative research design with the interpretive-exploratory paradigm. Research data obtained through secondary data from various research journals, articles, and government agencies. It uses a content analysis technique that is done by drawing conclusions based on identifying the specific characteristics of a message objectively and systematically. Based on the research findings, this study strongly agreed that the existence of fintech platforms and applications in Indonesia can certainly help move the wheels of the Indonesian economy. With the existence of a non-cash community, corruption and illegal fees can be prevented and monitored. Therefore, it concludes that fintech is proven to have a lot of benefits to increase state revenue so that it can be used as the media of digital economic solutions for sustainable finance and sustainable development in achieving the Indonesian people's standard of living independently. © 2020 IEEE.","Development; Finance; Fintech; Sustainable","Crime; Economics; Information management; Planning; Sustainable development; Content analysis; Economic solutions; Government agencies; Qualitative research; Research data; Research journals; Secondary datum; Standard of living; Fintech",,,,"Binus University","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This paper is submitted especial for 2020 International Conference on Information Management and Technology (ICIMTech) financially supported by Bina Nusantara University","(2017) Global Findex Database, , https://globalfindex.worldbank.org, World Bank Findek, World Bank accessed 10 July 2020; (2017) Analyzing Operational and Financial Performance on the Financial Technology (Fintech) Firm (Case Study on Samsung Pay)., , Alimirruchi; Dhar, V., Stein, R.M., Fintech platforms and strategy (2020) Communications of the ACM, 2017, pp. 32-35. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3132726, [2] Accessed from on July 10; (2020) The Role and Challenges of the FinTech (Financial Technology) Industry in the Economy, , https://www.ajarekonomi.com/2018/01/peran-dan-kontrolindustrifintech.html, accessed from, on July 10; (2017) Consumer Protection Study of the Financial Services Sector: Consumer Protection at Fintech: Jakarta, , Financial Services Authority; Financial technology development and policy responses of bank Indonesia Bank Indonesia-Fintech Office, p. 11. , Bank Indonesia; Gregory, M.N., (2009) Macroeconomics, , 7th Edition.

Additionally, the 21st-century classroom is also more dynamic thus the assessment that will be used by the English lecturer must be well comprehensive. To do this, the new classroom condition of the 21st-century is used as the basic consideration of learners’ needs. Therefore, the re-conceptualizing holistic assessment for culture-based English as a foreign language learning should be based on the integration of the modern assessment such as self-assessment, peer-assessment, authentic assessment, classroom assessment, and the objective assessment either formative and summative assessment. Finally, the implementation of holistic assessment can be done using online assessment or web-based assessment in which lecturer can directly upgrade the existing assessment to be blended model of assessment. © 2019 by the authors.","Culture-based; English as a foreign language leaning; Holistic assessment",,,,,"Thailand Development Research Institute, TDRI

The population is all non-English faculty lecturers and students and the samples selected by using simple random sampling with a lottery. This study started with the need analysis of qualitative data of the existing course outlines and the comprehensive literature review. After that, it analyzed the quantitative data collected from the interview of 3 sample lecturers and the questionnaire of 100 sample students. The result of the analysis concluded that the conceptual framework of innovative culture-based English learning model should involve (1) communicative-culture based English learning; (2) student-centered learning, and (3) internet and library access-based learning. The learning activities should include the internet-based portfolio using office 365, culture based-English video materials, discussions, oral presentation and take-home exams. The lecturer should act as a coach and facilitator to achieve the learning outcomes that include the communicative English proficiency, searching learners and culture awareness. The implication of this research is that the English learning model of non-English faculty at the University should significantly innovate; consequently, Bina Nusantara University should replace the existing English learning model. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

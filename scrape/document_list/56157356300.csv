Automatic vehicle detection and license plate recognition are employed to detect the traffic violation. To automatically detect the vehicle, Tiny-DSOD object detection is utilized, which has been proven for real-time performance. Then, Tiny-DSOD and WPOD-NET are combined to detect the unconstrained license plate with better performance and accuracy. Finally, a novel license plate recognition network is introduced to detect the characters in the license plate. Those methods are integrated into a web-based system to detect traffic violations in real time automatically. Experimental results show the performance of each module in the proposed system. The proposed DSWPOD-NET is confirmed to have less parameter and higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art WPOD-NET due to integration between Tiny-DSOD backend and WPOD license plate detector. © 2020 ICIC International.

Moreover, the implementation of a chatbot program in the industry helps the company to reduce their operational costs in engaging with their customers and employees. There are still quite a number of problems existed in order to build a human-like chatbot program. Understanding a natural conversation and replying back to the conversation the interlocutors, keeping the conversation flowing naturally is a cumbersome task for a computer. This research aims to design an emotionally realistic chatbot system to enhance the believability of the chatbot using Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) and Information State. The results show that there is a statistically significant improvement to the chatbot believability in the system that has emotions variables induced compare to the one without emotions. Moreover, 63,33% of the respondents perceived Aero and Iris as two different individuals. The future work of this research is to deploy and have an exploration of the chatbot system to other cases. © 2019 The Authors.

Companies can use information obtained from social media to analyze how the communities respond to their services or products. The biggest challenge in processing information in social media like Twitter, is the unstructured sentences which could lead to incorrect text processing. However, this information is very important for companies’ survival. In this research, we proposed a method to extract keywords from tweets in Indonesian language, WPKE. We compared it with RAKE, an algorithm that is language independent and usually used for keyword extraction. Finally, we develop a method to do clustering to groups the topics of complaints with data set obtained from Twitter using the “komplain” hashtag. Our method can obtain the accuracy of 72.92% while RAKE can only obtain 35.42%. Copyright © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Though there are numerous introduced algorithms to increase the spatial resolution for textual images, analysis on SR methods using deep learning is still insufficient. In this paper, we focus on evaluating the performance of various deep SR methods which have already confirmed to perform well in natural images super-resolution. Three evaluation metrics are used to analyze the performance of each method, such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structure similarity index (SSIM), and optical character recognition accuracy (OCRAcc). Experimental results show that deeper networks perform better than shallow networks for super-resolution problem. In overall, deep recursive convolutional network (DRCN) and deep laplacian pyramid network (LapSRN) alternately achieve the best performance. Then, very deep super-resolution network (VDSR) obtains the 3rd rank following both methods. © 2018 The Authors.

The high population of Jakarta increases the number of vehicles operating on the streets and causes congestion that leads to a loss of 67.5 trillion rupiah. The development of adequate public transport facilities is expected to be one of the solution, such as TransJakarta which has flat and low price. The bus fleets of TransJakarta are also equipped with air-conditioning. However, the level of public transport users is still quite low because the use of public transport is considered ineffective as it usually cost longer time to reach a destination. Based on the factors, the authors are encouraged to develop an Android-based application, ""TransTrip"", to provide clear information about the shortest path using Dijkstra algorithm and the type of public transportation that can be used to reach a destination, form a source location, with TransJakarta as the main transport and other public transport such as Angkot and Metromini to complete the routes.

BSS is a problem of separation of several speech signals in a real world from mono or stereo audio record. In this research, we implement BSP system using DUET algorithm which allow to separate any number of sources by using only stereo (two) mixtures. The DUET (Degenerate Unmixing Estimation Technique) algorithm replaces our previous FastICA (Fast Independent Component Analysis) method only success in simulation but failed in the implementation. The main problem of FastICA is that it assumes instantaneous mixing without time delay in the recording process. To deals with audio record in the presence of inevitable time delays, it has to be replaced with DUET algorithm to separate well in real time. Finally, the DUET algorithm is implemented to humanoid robot which is developed using Raspberry Pi and equipped with RaspPi Cam to detect human face. Furthermore, the Cirrus Logic Audio Card is stacked to Raspberry Pi in order to record stereo audio. In our experiments, there are three controlled variables to evaluate algorithm performance, that is: distance, number of sources, and subject's name. Robot will record stereo audio for four seconds after face is detected by system. The recording is then separated by DUET algorithm and produce two source estimations with average computation time 1.8 seconds. With Google API, the recognition accuracy of separated speech is varying between 40%-70%. © 2017 The Authors.

We obtain our dataset which is taken by using a web crawling method from www.cnnindonesia.com. First of all, the document will first undergo some Text Preprocessing method in the form of Lemmatization and Stopwords Removal. The reason we are doing the Text Preprocessing step before anything else is to minimize the noise in the document. Next, we apply Feature Selection onto the document to further separate important words and less important words inside the document. After applying Feature Selection, the document will be classified by the classifier. We are comparing the TF-IDF and SVD algorithm for feature selection, while also comparing the Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Multivariate Bernoulli Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine for the Classifiers. Based on the test results, the combination of TF-IDF and Multinomial Naïve Bayes Classifier gives the highest result compared to the other algorithms, which precision is 0.9841519 and its recall is 0.9840000. The result outperform the previous similar study that classify news article in Indonesian language which obtained 85% of accuracy. © 2017 The Authors.

Therefore, it is a must to manage the documents. Automatic text summarization is able to solve by producing text document summaries. The goal of the research is to produce a tool to summarize documents in Bahasa: Indonesian Language. It is aimed to satisfy the user’s need of relevant and consistent summaries. The algorithm is based on sentence features scoring by using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Genetic Algorithm for determining sentence feature weights. It is evaluated by calculating summarization speed, precision, recall, F-measure, and some subjective evaluations. Extractive summaries from the original text documents can represent important information from a single document in Bahasa with faster summarization speed compared to manual process.

However this is a non-trivial task because musical genres remain poorly defined concepts due to subjective human perception. In this experimental study, an attempt to combine Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT) based feature and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as classifier is proposed. The study focused on classifying four genres of music i.e. pop, classical, jazz, and rock by using strong features such as mean, standard deviation, variance, and entropy. Data used in the study is obtained from GTZAN Collection Data Sets. Based on the experimental results, the proposed approach produces 88.33% accuracy, which is higher than several previous methods that could only obtain accuracy up to 86.4%. © 2005 -2014 JATIT & LLS.

This recommendation also helps the consumer gets the preference object. One of the popular objects in the recommendation is anime film. In this case, we conduct research to recommend anime films based on ratings of previously watched films. Collaborative filtering is a technique that consists of calculating similarities, predictions, and recommendations. This study is taken from dataset Kaggle which consists of 73,516 users and 12,294 anime. A user's history will be matched with the whole user's history with alternating least squares (ALS) method. The anime will be recommended based on that results. This method is expected to help millions of users find the desired anime. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","anime; collaborative filtering; prediction; Recommendation technique","Collaborative filtering; Least squares approximations; Alternating least squares; Calculating similarities; Collaborative recommendation system; Recommender systems",,,,,"Vie, J.J., Yger, F., Lahfa, R., Clement, B., Cocchi, K., Chalumeau, T., Kashima, H., Using posters to recommend anime and mangas in a cold-start scenario (2017) IEEE 14th IAPR International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 3, pp. 21-26; Wang, X., Xu, Z., Xia, X., Mao, C., Computing user similarity by combining simrank++ and cosine similarities to improve collaborative filtering (2017) IEEE 14th Web Information Systems and Applications Conference (WISA), pp. 205-210; Dev, A.V., Mohan, A., Recommendation system for big data applications based on set similarity of user preferences (2016) IEEE International Conference on Next Generation Intelligent Systems (ICNGIS), pp. 1-6; Kumar, M., Yadav, D.K., Singh, A., Gupta, V.K., A movie recommender system: Movrec (2015) International Journal of Computer Applications, 124; Verstrepen, K., Goethals, B., Unifying nearest neighbors collaborative filtering (2014) Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pp. 177-184; Ma, S., Ahmad, Z., Arefin, M.S., Hossain, M.R., A user rating-based collaborative filtering approach to predict movie preferences (2017) IEEE 3rd International Conference on Electrical Information and Communication Technology (EICT), pp. 1-5; Wu, C.M., Garg, D., Bhandary, U., A Collaborative Filtering Recommender System with Randomized Learning Rate and Regularized Parameter (2018) IEEE 9th Int.

When the IT service management system (SMS) and an information security management system (ISMS) are implemented separately, it can lead to consuming high resources and costly. This paper is going to focus on the integration of ISO 20001 as SMS standard, ITIL v3 as the framework, and ISO 27001 as ISMS standard. We are going to discuss how the ITIL V3 can be combined with ISO 20001 and ISO 27001 by scientifically matching the similarities of process, procedure, and resources. This paper contributes to providing a guideline for an IT organization that is going to implement SMS and ISMS standard and framework. In the Appendix section 4, we also provide a table of process, procedures, and resources similarities. Therefore, the organization can use the combined processes in order to reduce the cost of implementing those standards. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

However, recognizing credit card fraudulent transaction is still an open problem despite many methods have been proposed. The main problems, among others, are imbalanced nature of the credit card transaction data and no agreed upon features to represent the transaction. This paper presents a novel approach to address such problem by exploiting card user spending behavior as the main feature to represent the transaction. in our experiment with Random forest we put max features parameter value 18 and 75 as number of trees in Random forest. While our experiment with OCSVM is by using 4 different kernels which are RBF, Polynomial, Linear and Sigmoid, and, we tuned nu and gamma parameter to get the optimal precision, recall and AUC for our Classifier. The experiment results found that One-Class SVM model achieve 0.984 AUC for training and 0.985 AUC for testing; whilst, Random Forest model achieves 0.991 AUC for training and 0.943 AUC for testing. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

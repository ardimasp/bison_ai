The development of students in the current generation who have entered generations Y and Z will undoubtedly affect the university's learning process. The learning process that is not interesting will cause students not to get maximum knowledge. Gamification in the learning process at a university is one method that can be applied so that the learning process becomes more exciting and useful. Triggered by these needs, this research focuses on developing mobile applications based on gamification. The application will feature Create Quiz, Create Interactive Study Case, Create Badge, Create Rank, View Scoreboard, Video-based forums, and View Achievement Report to increase knowledge and interest learning. System Development Life Cycle was the primary method to develop this mobile application. © 2020 IEEE.","Gamification learning system; Interactive learning; Students learning system","Gamification; Information management; Life cycle; Mobile computing; Students; Current generation; Learning Activity; Learning process; Mobile applications; Research focus; Study case; System development life cycles; Learning systems",,,,"Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement

The growth of online learning program faces issue and challenge in assuring the completion of students' learning outcomes. The completion of them will represent the effectiveness of the learning process in online environment, so that it can gain trust from the public in terms of quality of education. For accommodating this need, the research has been conducted in order to propose an application design for measuring the completion of students' learning outcomes in online learning environment. Design application will follow the methodology of system development life cycle (SDLC) with waterfall approach. The design of functional, data, and user interface will be the output of this research.

This alternative offers you online learning interactions through synchronous and asynchronous session, which usually accommodated by learning management systems or another technology platform and applications. Basically, in online learning environment, the learning interaction will have a transition from teacher-dependent to learner-dependent, but it still can't be concluded that the succession in online learning doesn't affected by the teaching styles of the instructor. This study is aimed to see whether the teaching styles of the instructors will have an impact in academic achievement of the students. The study was conducted by a comparative study towards two classes with two different instructors, which have their own teaching styles. The result said that the class with the more active and responsive instructors has a better results in score. © 2017 IEEE.","academic achievement; learning interaction; online learning; teaching styles","Computer aided instruction; Information management; Online systems; Teaching; Academic achievements; Comparative studies; Learning interactions; Learning management system; Online learning; Online learning environment; Teaching styles; Technology platforms; E-learning",,,,,,"Kurniali, S., An approach to online learning using learning management system in higher education institution (2014) J.

Information transparency is needed to maintain good governance and can also prevent corruption. However, information on the sustainability of development programs carried out by the government is much unknown to the public. In addition, the government must be burdened with public dissatisfaction due to fake news (hoax). The Ministry of Public Works has tried to build a website to disseminate its programs. However, measurement of the quality of the website is needed. This study uses questionnaires with a Likert scale to obtain user interface assessment data in accordance with the WebQual 4.0 method. This study shows that the easiness of the website to use has the highest correlation with how helpful the website is. Public works ministry websites need to more frequently update valid information and promote transparency. The society also wants online complaint platform to make it easier to solve problems. © 2019 IEEE.","evaluation; government portal; user interface; WebQual","Knowledge management; Portals; Public works; Surveys; Transparency; Development programs; evaluation; Good governances; Government IS; Information transparency; Interface evaluation; Knowledge management portals; WebQual; User interfaces",,,,,"Harris, M.L., (2011) Strategic Relationships in A Small Business Context: The Impact of Information Quality and Continuous Quality Improvement, , March; Palinkas, L.A., Horwitz, S.M., (2013) Purposeful Sampling for Qualitative Data Collection and Analysis in Mixed Method Implementation Research, , November; Campos, R., Jatowt, A., (2014) Survey of Temporal Information Retrieval and Related Applications, , October 2015; Ceri, S., Bozzon, A., Brambilla, M., Della Valle, E., Fraternali, P., Quarteroni, S., (2013) Web Information Retrieval.; Li, A.M., Yatrakis, P., Turner, D., Yen, B., Hsu, J., The relationship between internet usage and decision making: The case of information technology (it) managers in China (2003) J.

The study was conducted from April to July 2015. The method used for this study is literature review. Data collection methods were interviews, observation of the features of the BPN web, check listing and documentation. WebQual method (www.webqual.UK) is used as a framework of this study. Measurement is based on quality function deployment (QFD) to evaluate the quality of a website based on research instruments that can be categorized into three variables, namely: usability, information quality and services interaction. Results show that the evaluation of the information systems of the BPN web to increase user's satisfaction has found some weaknesses. Weaknesses that exist allow for potential risks that could occur and recommendation is necessary as remedial action. © 2017 IEEE.","Evaluation; information quality and services interaction; Information Systems; usability","Information analysis; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Quality function deployment; Data collection method; Evaluation; Information quality; Quality function deployments (QFD); Research instruments; usability; User's satisfaction; Web information systems; Quality control",,,,,"Anderson, D.R., Sweeney, D.J., Williams, T.A., (2008) Statistics for Business and Economics, , (10th ed.)

So, the university can win the competition with other universities in line with increasing the society needs of formal education. The object of this research is one of the universities in Jakarta, Indonesia, whereas the focus is the feature or variable of user friendly and menu to satisfaction variable on the web which supports the teaching and learning process in university. Nowadays, the introduction of E-Learning system prepares student learning material as online access is becoming widespread trend, especially at the university. The research aims to find out user friendly features and menu which is influence learning process on the web at one of university in Jakarta, as a consideration reference for university leader for taking a policy as a way to increase the learning system quality. The method for this research is the use of literature study, questionnaire for lecturer and university students on odd semester 2013/2014 with the use of likert scales shown that university student of variable X1 is neutral or user is satisfied or unsatisfied. Meanwhile, most of X2 variable is neutral, the user said that they were satisfy with D-10 with the score is 1723, and then for the Y variable is the user satisfaction toward web is neutral. The result of questionnaire toward lecturer shown that X1 variable about user friendly is 2 variables are satisfied and 4 variables are neutral or user satisfaction and dissatisfaction toward the web. As for X2 variable about menu shown that 11 variables are satisfied with score above 237, meanwhile 4 variables are neutral with score between 212 until 226. So, it can be conclude that user friendly features are quite influenced user satisfaction on learning process. © 2016 IEEE.","likert scale; literature; menu; user friendly; variable","Education; Information management; Learning systems; Societies and institutions; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Likert scale; literature; menu; User friendly; variable; E-learning",,,,,"Bawaneh, S.S., The effects of blended learning approach on students' performance: Evidence from a computerized accounting course (2011) International Journal of Humanities and Social Science, pp. 63-69; Beaumont, G., Ker, S., (2004) Constructing Usable Web Menus, , Apress; Concannon, F., Flynn, A., Campbell, M., What campusbased students think about the quality and benefits of elearning (2005) British Journal of Educational Technology, pp. 501-512; Dzakiria, H., Don, S.M., Action research on blended learning transformative potential in higher education-learners' perspectives (2012) Business and Management Research, pp. 125-134; Fazlollahtabar, H., Reliability-based dynamic programming for elearning user profile assessment (2012) International Journal of Information and Communication Technology Education, pp. 13-21; Hirzallah, N., An authoring tool for as-in-class e-lectures in elearning systems (2007) American Journal of Applied Sciences; Indriantoro, N., Supomo, B., (2002) Metodologi Penelitian Bisnis:Untuk Akuntansi Dan Manajemen, , Yogyakarta: BPFE; Khalid, S., Mohd, T.M., Hassanah, K., Sanip, S., Aris, M.S., Sharif, K., E-learning readiness among medical educators in UniversitiSainsIslam Malaysia (2014) American Journal of Applied Sciences, pp. 17-23; Stacey, G., Teaching for blended learning: Research perspectives from on-campus and distance students (2007) Education and Information Technologies, pp. 165-174; Thowfeek, M.H., Jaafar, A., Instructors' view about implementation of e-learning system: An analysis based on Hofstede'scultural dimensions (2012) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, pp. 961-967; Diaz, V., Cloud-based technologies: Faculty development, support, and implementation (2011) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 15 (1), pp. 95-102. , Feb; El-Seoud, S., Abou, M., El-Sofany, H.F., Taj-Eddin, I.A.T.F., Nosseir, A., El-Khouly, M.M., Implementation of web-based education in Egypt through cloud computing technologies and its effect on higher education (2013) Higher Education Studies, 3 (3), pp. 62-76; Liao, Jian, Wang, Minhong, Ran, Weijia, Yang, Stephen, J.H., Collaborative cloud: A new model for e-learning (2014) Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 51 (3), pp. 338-351",,,"BINUS Univerity;IEEE Indonesia Section;Wiley","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2016","16 November 2016 through 18 November 2016",,127842,,9781509033522,,,"English","Proc.

To improve the competitiveness of cooperative, website that allows members/customers to search products and information related to cooperatives is made. Then, it analyzed using the method of making a website with 7 stages of internet marketing and the method of calculating the cost-benefit analysis to conduct an analysis of the investment value of the website creation. So far, Cooperative's marketing has been done conventionally. Cooperative has not been able to reach the online segment which has a larger market, so that Cooperatives can only serve customers who live close by. The result achieved from this design is a website that can be a place for cooperative in marketing their products. Website contains features that can help the cooper­ative to market their products and announce information like promos and other conveniences that can increase the profit earned by the cooperative.

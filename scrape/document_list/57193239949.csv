In this paper, the research was continued by combining radio-frequency identification (RFID) and GPS in order to get better human tracking in both indoor and outdoor area. For indoor tracking, an RFID tag was carried by a user and continually read whenever he/she accessed a room while GPS was used mainly when the user was staying outdoor. GPS would be automatically activated whenever the user leaved the room 3 meters away. The accuracy of this tracking was 100% and the GPS could allocate the user every 3.27 meters. Thus this application is suitable to track the human position for both indoor and outdoor. © 2016 IEEE.","ADB; GPS; human tracking; raspberry pi; RFID","Radio frequency identification (RFID); Human Tracking; Indoor tracking; RF-ID tags; Global positioning system",,,,,"Gerdisen, Y., Solid, V., Wahyudi, O., Hutabarat, D.P., Hedwig, R., Human tracking in a certain closed area based on global positioning system (GPS) (2014) Internetworking Indonesia Journal, 6 (1 B), pp. 3-6; Zhang, D., Xia, F., Yang, Z., Yao, L., Zhao, W., Localization technologies for indoor human tracking (2010) 5th International Conference on Future Information Technology, pp. 1-6. , Busan; Tesoriero, R., Tebar, R., Gallud, J.A., Lozano, M.D., Penichet, V.M.R., Improving location awareness in indoor spaces using RFID technology (2010) Expert Systems with Applications, 37 (1), pp. 894-898. , January; Guillemette, M.G., Fontaine, I., Caron, C., Hybrid RFID-GPS real-time location system for human resources: Development, impacts and perspectives (2008) 41st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, p. 406. , Waikoloa; Pejic, A., Pletl, S., Pejic, B., An expert system for tourists using google maps API (2009) 7th International Symposium on Intelligent Systems and Informatics, Subotica, pp. 317-322; Höflinger, F., Zhang, R., Hoppe, J., Bannoura, A., Reindl, L.M., Wendeberg, J., Bührer, M., Schindelhauer, C., Acoustic self-calibrating system for indoor smartphone tracking (ASSIST) (2012) International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN), Sydney, pp. 1-9; Richardson, M., Wallace, S., (2013) Getting Started with Raspberry Pi, , First Edition ed., B.

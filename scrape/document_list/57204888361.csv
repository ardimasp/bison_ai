However, what about the food ordering process at the Padang restaurant? The mechanism is still conventional, and of course, it will lead to inefficiency in their dish processing cycle. Often we encounter many Padang dishes unsold in a day. Also, the food is re-heated again, which is very dangerous for health, especially when the food contains coconut milk base. Through the development of bring your own device (BYOD) application, it is expected to improve several processes on food ordering, table reservation, payment, and delivery at Padang food restaurant chains. Then these processes can be done easily and improve work efficiency of the company. © 2017 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.","Bring your own device (BYOD) concept; Food ordering and delivery application system; Padang food; Software development; Web based application",,,,,,"Satzinger, J.W., Jackson, R.B., Burd, S.D., (2012) Systems Analysis and Design in A Changing World, , 6th ed., Course Technology, Boston; Turban, E., King, D., Lee, J., Liang, T.-P., Turban, D., (2015) Electronic Commerce: A Managerial and Social Networks Perspective, pp. 561-596. , Electronic Commerce 8th ed., Springer International Publishing; Bansal, G., Zahedi, F.M., Gefen, D., The impact of personal dispositions on information sensitivity, privacy concern and trust in disclosing health information online (2010) Decis.

The source of text mining should be coming from social media users' activities; e.g. posting, fans page, group, hashtag, tweet, etc. As raw data and information, the text mining sources are able to be gold information to be operated for academic analyzing purposes. This paper proposes the Python-based model to scrape text from Twitter user's tweets and then analyze them to see the commerce and tax-income potency in purposely Indonesia. The mathematical and statistical methods are technically operated. The constructed model finally exhibited. Also, the information on sale-behavior and tax-income forecasts are able to be portrayed. © 2019 IEEE.","Indonesia; sale behavior; tax projection; text mining","Commerce; Social networking (online); Data and information; Indonesia; Model configuration; Online commerce; Social media; Tax incomes; tax projection; Text mining",,,,"12/AKM/PNT/2019","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, the Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Aplikasi Model Kontrol Bisnis Online di Media Sosial: Studi Kasus Peningkatan Pendapatan Pajak di Indonesia” with contract number: 12/AKM/PNT/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","Sihombing, H.C., Fajar, A.N., Utama, D.N., Instant messaging as information goldmines to digital forensic: A systematic review (2018) International Conference on Information Management and Technology, , Jakarta; Sun, A., Lachanski, M., Fabozzi, F.J., Trade the tweet: Social media text mining and sparse matrix factorization for stock market prediction (2016) International Review of Financial Analysis, 48, pp. 272-281; He, W., Zha, S., Li, L., Social media competitive analysis and text mining: A case study in the pizza industry (2013) International Journal of Information Management, 33 (3), pp. 464-472; Monkman, G.G., Kaiser, M.J., Hyder, K., Text and data mining of social media to map wildlife recreation activity (2018) Biological Conservation, 228, pp. 89-99; Shen, C.-W., Chen, M., Wang, C.-C., Analyzing the trend of o2o commerce by bilingual text mining on social media (2018) Computers in Human Behavior; Serna, A., Gasparovic, S., Transport analysis approach based on big data and text mining analysis from social media (2018) Transportation Research Procedia, 33, pp. 291-298; Gal-Tzur, A., Grant-Muller, S.M., Kuflik, T., Minkov, E., Nocera, S., Shoor, I., The potential of social media in delivering transport policy goals (2014) Transport Policy, 32, pp. 115-123; Kirilenko, A.P., Stepchenkova, S.O., Sochi 2014 olympics on twitter: Perspectives of hosts and guests (2017) Tourism Management, 63, pp. 54-65; Kirilenko, A.P., Data for sochi 2014 olympics discussion on social media (2017) Data in Brief, 13, pp. 605-608; Mansour, S., Social media analysis of user's responses to terrorism using sentiment analysis and text mining (2018) Procedia Computer Science, 140, pp. 95-103; Burnap, P., Rana, O.F., Avis, N., Williams, M., Housley, W., Edwards, A., Morgan, J., Sloan, L., Detecting tension in online communities with computational twitter analysis (2015) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 95, pp. 96-108; Greco, F., Polli, A., Emotional text mining: Customer profiling in brand management (2019) International Journal of Information Management, , In press; Das, S., Dutta, A., Medina, G., Minjares-Kyle, L., Elgart, Z., Extracting patterns from twitter to promote biking (2019) IATSS Research, 43 (1), pp. 51-59; Öztürk, N., Ayvaz, S., Sentiment analysis on twitter: A text mining approach to the syrian refugee crisis (2018) Telematics and Informatics, 35 (1), pp. 136-147; Tanulia, Y., Girsang, A.S., Sentiment analysis on twitter for predicting stock exchange movement (2019) Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems Journal, 4 (2), pp. 244-250",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","7th International Conference on Cyber and IT Service Management, CITSM 2019","6 November 2019 through 7 November 2019",,157081,,9781728129099,,,"English","Int.

This research is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). The object of this research is micro business people in Grogol Petamburan district. The results of the study state that performance expectancy and effort expectancy influence behavioral intention, while social influence does not have a significant effect on behavioral intention and facilitating conditions that have no significant effect on use behavior. Behavioral intention affects use behavior. In addition, gender differences reinforce the influence of performance expectancy and effort expectancy on behavioral intention, but do not strengthen the influence of social influence to behavioral intention. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery","Acceptance; Business; Micro; Structural; Technology","Behavioral research; Big data; Computation theory; Industry; Acceptance; Acceptance of information technologies; Facilitating conditions; Micro; Quantitative research; Structural; Technology acceptance model; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Economic and social effects",,,,,,"Walfajri, M., Narita, (2018) Jumlah Pelaku UMKM Di 2018 Diprediksi Mencapai 58,97 Juta Orang, , https://keuangan.kontan.co.id/news/jumlahpelaku-umkm-di-2018-diprediksi-mencapai-5897-juta-orang; Yuliani, A., (2018) Kemenkop UKM: 3,79 Juta UMKM Sudah Go Online, , https://www.kominfo.go.id/content/detail/11526/kemenkopukm-379-juta-umkm-sudah-go-online/0/sorotan_media; Coupez, A., (2017) Sharing Economy: A Drive to Success the Case of GO-JEK in Jakarta, Indonesia, , University of Louvain; Agusta, J., Hutabarat, K., (2018) Mobile Payments in Indonesia, , Jakarta; Venkatesh, V., Morris, M.G., Hall, M., Davis, G.B., Davis, F.D., Walton, S.M., User acceptance of information technology: Toward a unified view (2003) MIS Q, 27 (3), pp. 425-478; (2016) UKM Yang Dimiliki Wanita Di Indonesia: Kesempatan Emas Untuk Institusi Keuangan Lokal, pp. 1-84. , International Financial Corporation; Davis, F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance (1989) MIS Q, 13 (3), pp. 319-339; Fishbein, M., Ajzen, I., (1975) Belief, Attitude, Intention and Behaviour: An Introduction to Theory and Research, p. 480. , Read.

The readiness assessment towards INDI 4.0 should be different for each industry. Specific industry value chains need to be examined and their readiness needs to be assessed prior to digitalization project. Mobility is the nature of the Upstream Oil and Gas industry due to remote and vast work areas. Thus, an adoption of digitalization without considering mobility aspects will be less effective. Efficiency expectations from using cloud infrastructure will also be difficult to achieve. Through RAMI 4.0 approach, it is expected that a reference can be obtained grouping value chains in clear hierarchical dimension so that readiness towards INDI 4.0 in the Upstream Oil and Gas industry can be assessed more specifically and accurately. The assessment framework reference is extracted from several sources in order to obtain aspect dimension in the form of people, process and platform. By using these two dimensions, which are hierarchical and aspect dimension, it is expected that the results of the assessment can help making the strategy of implementing Mobile Cloud Computing in the Upstream Oil and Gas industry more specific but still provide flexibility so that the adoption stages can be realistic in accordance to strategic road map. © 2020 IEEE.","Computer integrated manufacturing; Internet of Things; Mobile ad hoc networks; RAMI 4.0; Readiness assessment framework; Upstream Oil Gas","Gases; Information management; Mobile cloud computing; Petroleum industry; Cloud infrastructures; Industry value chains; Low priorities; Oil and Gas Sector; Readiness assessment; Two-dimension; Upstream oil and gas industry; Value chains; Gas industry",,,,,"(2019) Indonesia Industry 4. 0 Readiness Index, , Kemenperin Kemenperin, Jakarta; Eloy Álvarez, M.B.B.J.A.M.R.S., The oil and gas value chain: A focus on oil refining (2018) Boston Consulting Group in Collaboration with Orkestra, , San Sebastián; Alexander Benlian, W.K.A.S.T.J.W., The transformative value of cloud computing: A decoupling, platformization, and recombination theoretical framework (2018) Journal of Management Information Systems (JMIS), 35. , accepted 03-May-2018; Rojko, A., Industry 4. 0 concept: Background and overview (2017) International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies, 11 (5). , Special Focus Paper; Schweichhart, K., (2020) Reference Architectural Model Industrie 4. 0 (RAMI 4. 0), , https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/a2-schweichhartreference_architectural_model_industrie_4.0_rami_4.0.pdf, Accessed 12 January; (2019) AWS Cloud Adoption Readiness Assessment, , https://cloudreadiness.amazonaws.com/#/cart/assessment, I. o. i.

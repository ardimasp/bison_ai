There are variety and different organization for support the integration mechanism. We proposed the concept of implementation about travel reservation solution that called To-Tour for use by travellers using on Service Oriented Analysis and Design Approach, specifically in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). To-Tour is a Tour Travel Agency offering any trips from different vendor, and provide any variety features such as hotel, restaurant, car & motorcycle rent, trip destination, tour package, tour guide, merchandise, train, flight and the other feature in one platform application. Service Oriented Analysis and Design can combine any entities from different providers that can be integrated together to provide Smart Travel System services for travellers. To-Tour system is also designed to develop the tourism industries in Indonesia could appealing to any different travels segments. To-Tour is a new way to reservation any services for travel on one application. Smart Travel System is solution in Indonesia, the travellers can search various travels or other services in our application. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Information services; Design approaches; Integration mechanisms; Service Oriented; System services; Tour guide; Tourism industry; Travel agency; Travel reservations; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,"Svanidzaite, Sandra, A Comparison of SOA Methodologies Analysis & Design Phases Databases and Information Systems BalticDB&IS, 2012, p. 202; Fareghzadeh, Nafise, Service identification approach to SOA development (2008) - Proceedings of World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, 35; Erl, T., (2005) Service Oriented Architecture: Concept, Technology, and Design, , (Prentice Hall); Adipradana, B., (2008) Penerapan Business Process Management Dalam Service-Oriented Architecture, , (Institut Teknologi Bandung); Rosen, M., Lublinsky, B., Smith, K.T., (2008) Applied SOA, , (Indianapolis: Wiley Publishing, Inc); Peraturan Presiden Republik Indonesia Nomor 49 Tahun 2016.

Since variety of travel services may come from different departments and same type of the travel services may have several providers. This paper proposed for combining any various travel service in one application including travel reservation services and give an additional features. How to integrate these services from different departments for travelers to provide ease of use cross platform and travel services has become an important in Smart Travel System (STS). ESB is the primary function to exchange the transformation of protocol, message or data. According to the ESB, STS is a way to provide the travel services that can give an experience for travelers in reservation any travel services from any devices in one application. This paper is proposed to answer about the problem of travel service providers in Indonesia, which have many features in one application that can be used from various platforms. These features consist of travel packages, booking airline tickets, buses, trains, hotel reservations, tour guides, looking for nearby attractions, car motorcycle rentals, and souvenirs. © 2018 IEEE.","ESB; Service Oriented Architecture (SOA); Smart Travel System; Travel Services","Architecture; Computer architecture; Information services; Metadata; Pattern recognition; Reservation systems; Airline tickets; Business goals; Cross-platform; Primary functions; Smart Travel System; Travel packages; Travel reservation service; Travel services; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,"Kemenpar, (2016) Laporan Akuntabilitas Kinerja Kementrian Pariwisata Tahun, , 2016; Perkembangan Usaha Jasa Perjalanan Wisata Berskala Menengah Dan Besar, Tahun 2007-2011, , http://www.kemenpar.go.id, BPS Statistik Jasa Perjalanan Wisata Taken back from; Wang, D., Research on design and realization of SOA-based tourism e-commerce system (2017) Revista de la Facultad de Ingeniería U.C.V., 32 (13), pp. 732-736; Choi, S.-Y., Lee, H.-C., Jin, H.-J., Design of the travel agency system based on service oriented architecture for business models (ICCAS 2008) (2008) International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems; Newcomer, E., Lomow, G., (2006) Understanding SOA with Web Service, , Addison-Wesley, New York; Arsanjani, A., Service-oriented modeling and architecture (2004) IBM Developer Works, 1, p. 15; Navabpour, S., Ghoraie, L.S., Malayeri, A.A., Chen, J., Lu, J., An intelligent traveling service based on SOA (2008) 2008 IEEE Congress on Services 2008-Part I, pp. 191-198. , July IEEE; Hung, J.C., The smart-travel system: Utilising cloud services to aid traveller with personalised requirement (2012) International Journal of Web and Grid Services, 8 (3), pp. 279-303; Hung, J.C., Hsu, V., Wang, Y.-B., A smart-travel system based on social network services for cloud environment (2011) Third International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems; Implementation of Service-Oriented Architecture with Web Service for Academic Information Application; Thomas, E., (2006) Service-Oriented Architecture Concept Technology and Design, , acorn Korea; Jhingran, A., Enterprise information mashups: Integrating information, simply (2006) VLDB '06: Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, pp. 3-4. , VLDB Endowment; Dadape, N., Jadhav, J.R., Gaidhani, B.R., Vyavahare, P.Y., Achaliya Parag, S.U., Smart travel guide: Application for android mobile (2012) International Conference on Recent Trends in Engineering & Technology, Special Issue of International Journal of Electronics, Communication & Soft Computing Science & Engineering; Al-Omari, A.H., Al-Marghirani, A., (2017) Smart Tourism Architectural Model (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: A Case Study) (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 8 (10). , 2017; (2017) Book Autonomous Smart Travel Ecosystem V. 3.1.0, , September 17; Andress, M., The road to secure web services (2002) InfoWorld, 24 (2), p. 52; Fajar, A.N., Legowo, N., Services modeling based on SOA and BPM for information system flexibility improvement (2018) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering., 8 (4), pp. 2451-2455; Palavinel, K., Kuppuswami, S., Architecture solutions to e-learning systems using service-oriented cloud computing reference architecture (2014) IJIAEM., 3 (3), pp. 547-559; Zimmermann, O., Krogdahl, P., Gee, C., Elements of service-oriented analysis and design (2004) IBM Developerworks; Arsanjani, A., How to identify, specify, and realize services for your SOA (2005) IBM Corporation, February; Juric, M.B., Loganathan, R., Sarang, P., Jennings, F., (2007) SOA Approach to Integration; Andary, J.F., Sage, A.P., The role of service oriented architectures in systems engineering (2010) Information Knowledge Systems Management, 9 (1), pp. 47-74; Zhai, Y., Zhang, J., Lin, K.J., SOA middleware support for service process reconfiguration with end-to-end QoS constraints (2009) Web Services, 2009.

Furthermore, the development of Service Oriented Architecture technology is now adopted in various fields. The use of Smart Agriculture System can help people who work in an agricultural sector. Components in Smart Agriculture Systems integrated an entity such as hotel, hospital, logistic, restaurant, supermarket and traditional market who can get a message, information, and data throughout Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). Service Oriented Architecture help to share information and data very quickly because using SOA connects various actors in the material sales industry. The usage of SOA in the field of agriculture is expected to help the economy in Indonesia and also can suppress prices so it will not soar. This high price is caused by various factors such as lack of technological knowledge among farmers. There are still many brokers who become third parties from the distribution of agricultural food ingredients in Indonesia. With the implementation of SOA, it is expected to help farmers for a better living. © 2018 IEEE.","Agriculture; Enterprise Service Bus; Service Oriented Architecture; Smart Agriculture Systems","Agriculture; Information services; Information systems; Information use; Agricultural foods; Agricultural sector; Enterprise service bus; High price; Smart agricultures; Technological knowledge; Third parties; Traditional markets; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,"Indonesia, S., (2016) Badan Pusat Statistik.

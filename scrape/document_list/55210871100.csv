To achieving production targets there are some that become problems. Production problems can be internal and external problems. This study discusses the problem of achieving production targets that are internal. Based on the information from the company, component availability is one of the problem of production targets for the machines. Therefore, a schedule is made for the supply of machine components so as to reduce engine breakdown time and make engine performance to the maximum by using Maintenance Management method. Other than that, performed the calculation of the cost for maintenance of the machine by using two methods to be selected based on the lowest cost. The result of the calculation shows the best method to generate the lowest cost is the Repair Maintenance Policy Method. The results that have been obtained are expected to be a consideration of the company for improvement in the future. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The research method used is Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modelling, PLS-SEM to determine the relationship between E-SQ to CS, E-SQ to BI, CS to BI and the relationship of E-SQ to BI with CS as a mediating variable. In processing data, it is known that E-SQ significantly affects CS with a value of 81.1%. Non-significant E-SQ affects BI with a value of 0.056, where E-SQ significantly affects BI with CS variable as a mediating variable with a value of 0.599. Based on the calculation results, it is found that CS directly affects BI users of electronic money ABC with a value of 0.669.

Hence, there is increasing attention and research, among academics and practitioners in the environmental management of supply chain through Green Supply Chain Management, GSCM. Nevertheless, research on GSCM in Indonesia's industries is limited. In this study, 63 data sets that can be used are collected from various companies around Jakarta Indonesia where 32 companies have adopted Green Supply Chain, and 31 others have not yet. Questionnaires refined with the partial least square-structural equation PLS SEM modelling, resulted significant positive relationship between motivational factors and internal factors (green design, green procurement and green production); internal factors with Green Supply Chain Impact GSCI and external factor (recycle packaging) with GSCI, but the study found that motivational factor has no effect on external factor. For companies that have not implemented GSC, motivational factor has an effect on GSC implementation. Therefore, this research has relevance to all companies that want to improve the process of Green Supply Chain through driving factor, and internal factor so enhanced company performance efficiency. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

As a result, awareness and food safety educational initiatives campaigns should be developed to better inform young adults about safe food practices and habits in buying food online. © 2017 IEEE.","average linkage; cluster analysis; consumer behavior; food safety; food shop online; ward's method","Cluster analysis; Consumer behavior; Decision making; Occupational diseases; Safety factor; Students; Average linkage; College students; Digital technologies; Food producers; Social media; Triggering factors; Virtual shops; Ward's method; Food safety",,,,,"Indonesian Internet Service Provider Association, , https://www.apjii.or.id/, Press release; Van der Veer, L., Real food from virtual shops a case study from the netherlands (2012) European Food and Feed Law Review, 1, pp. 3-13; Manning, L., Mechanisms for assessing food safety risk (2013) British Food Journal, 115 (3), pp. 460-484. , 2013; Johnson, R.A., Wichern, D.W., (1992) Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis, , Third Edition.

The objective of this study is to identify the risks in the flavor supply chain and then assess them in order to develop appropriate mitigation strategies. Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) is utilized to assess the risks. This study uses a case study approach. The object of the study is a multinational flavor company in Indonesia. This study identified 22 risk factors in the flavor supply chain. Based on the assessment of the risk factors, there are three high priority risk factors: economic downturn, demand fluctuation, and raw materials shortage. Overall, this study identified and assessed supply chain risk factors in the Indonesian flavor industry. © IEOM Society International. © IEOM Society International.","Flavor; FMEA; Indonesia; supply chain risk management",,,,,,"Li, S., Ragu-Nathan, B., Ragu-Nathan, T.S., Rao, S.S., The impact of supply chain management practices on competitive advantage and organizational performance (2006) Omega, 34, pp. 107-124; Zsidisin, G.A., A grounded definition of supply risk (2003) Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 9, pp. 217-224; Elangovan, D., Sundaraj, G., Devadasan, S.R., Karuppuswamy, P., Development of futuristic supply chain risk management pilot strategies for achieving loss reduction in manufacuring organisations (2011) World Journal of Enterpreneurship, Management and Sustainable Development, 6 (1-2), pp. 39-51; Tang, C.S., Perspectives in supply chain risk management (2006) International Journal of Production Economics, 103 (2), pp. 451-488; Karthick, M., Manikandan, V., FMEA based Quantification Analysis of Outbound Supplier Risk and its Resilience (2014) Global Journal of Researches in Engineering (G), 14 (1), pp. 1-8; Miguel, P.L.S., Brito, L.A.L., Supply Chain Management measurement and its influence on Operational Performance (2011) Journal of Operations and Supply Chain Management, 4 (2), pp. 56-70; Agus, A., Supply Chain Management, Product Quality and Business Performance (2011) International Proceedings of Economics Development and Research, 10, pp. 98-102; Harland, C., Brenchley, R., Walker, H., Risk in supply networks (2003) Journal of Purchasing & Supply Management, 9, pp. 51-62; Tohidi, H., The role of risk management in IT systems of organizations (2011) Procedia Computer Science, 3, pp. 881-887; Thakore, R., Dave, R., Parsana, T., A Case Study: A Process FMEA Tool to Enhance Quality and Efficiency of Bearing Manufacturing Industry (2015) Scholars Journal of Engineering and Technology, 3 (4), pp. 413-418; Sharma, S., Pratap, R., A Case Study of Risks Prioritization using FMEA Method (2013) International Journal of Scientific and Research Publications, 3 (10), pp. 1-4; Juttner, U., Peck, H., Christopher, M., Supply Chain Risk Management: Outlining an Agenda for Future Research (2003) International Journal of Logistics: Research and Applications, 6 (4), pp. 197-210; Ritchie, B., Brindley, C., Supply chain risk management and performance: A guiding framework for future development (2007) International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 27 (3), pp. 303-322; Wang, Y.M., Chin, K.S., Poon, G.K.K., Yang, J.B., Risk evaluation in failure mode and effects analysis using fuzzy weighted geometric mean (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36, pp. 1195-1207; Chang, K.H., Chang, Y.C., Wen, T.C., Cheng, C.H., An Innovative Approach Integrating 2-Tuple and LOWGA operators in process failure mode and effects analysis (2012) International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 8 (1), pp. 747-761; Anggara, R.A., Implementation of Risk Management Framework in Supply Chain: A Tale from a Biofuel Company in Indonesia (2011) Manchester Business School Working Paper, Number, 614. , http://ssrn.com/abstract=1763154,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1763154, Available at SSRN; Sarpong, K.O., Alexander, O.F., Anin, E.K., An assessment of supply chain risks in the cocoa industry in the Ashanti region, Ghana (2013) International Journal of Humanities and Social Science, 3 (19), pp. 191-201; Anin, E.K., Alexander, O.F., Adzimah, D.E., Managing supply chain risks: A perspective of exportable pineapple fresh fruits in Ghana (2015) European Journal of Business and Management, 7 (3), pp. 59-71; Norrman, A., Jansson, U., Ericcson's proactive supply chain risk management approach after a serious sub-supplier accident (2004) International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 34 (5), pp. 434-456; Sekaran, U., Bougie, R., (2013) Research Method for Business: A Skill-Building Approach, , 6th ed.

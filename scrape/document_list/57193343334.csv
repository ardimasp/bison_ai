Cinemagraph approach offers a new visual language that was never explored before. Even with a simple presentation, the visual effect created using cinemagraph can be a memorable and deep experience. The ability of cinemagraph to draw attention and give a deep experience are some of the main reasons why it has succeeded to be a new visual communication media. Illustration as a visual communication media that also thrives in the digital world, can make use of cinemagraph. The researchers consider this possibility interesting and something worth reviewed. This research's purpose is to look into possibilities of using cinemagraph technique in illustration that might eventually be an effort to bring a breath of fresh air in the illustration world. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Photography; Visual communication; Digital world; Fresh air; Visual effects; Visual languages",,,,,"The authors gratefully acknowledge that the present research is supported by Ministry of Research and Technology and Higher Education Republic of Indonesia.

Digital technology is developing so fast and affecting the way people to see things differently by communicating with each other or seeking for some information. To help the digital native to gain any information regarding Indonesia cultural preservation, the researchers conducted questionnaire by collecting data from smartphone user to build the design interface for iOS and Android system. Results were implemented into two alternatives design using principle and design elements, although the outcome of interface design are visual aesthetically, the main problem it's not about the design. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Physics; Android systems; Cultural preservation; Design elements; Design interface; Digital natives; Digital technologies; Interface designs; Mobile applications; Mobile computing",,,,,,"Koentjaraningrat, (2009) Pengantar Antropologi i, p. 72. , (Jakarta: Rineka Cipta); Nwegbu, M.U., Eze, C.C., Asogwa, B.E., Globalization of Cultural Heritage: Issues, Impacts, and Inevitable Challenges for Nigeria (2011) Library Philosophy and Practice, p. 674; Unesco, (2008) World Heritage Information Kit, , (Paris, France: World Heritage Centre); Prensky, M., Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants (2001) On the Horizon, 9, p. 1; Apjii, (2017) Penetrasi Dan Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia, , (Jakarta: Teknopreneur Indonesia); Takahashi, T., (2011) New Media Literacies in the Digital Age: Cross-cultural Research from US and UK, , (Japan: Yoshida Hideo Memorial Foundation); Bowen, J.P., Giannini, T., Digitalism: The New Realism (2014) EVA London 2014 Conference: Electronic Visualisation and the Arts; Beasley, S., Conway, A., Digital Media in Everyday Life: A Snapshot of Devices, Behaviors, and Attitudes Part 1: Mobile Device Ownership (2012) Museum and the Web 2012 San Diego 2012; Fantoni, S.F., Bowen, J., (2008) Digital Technologies and the Museum Experience: Handheld Guides and Other Media, pp. 79-96. , ed L Tallon and K Walker (Plymouth, UK: Alta Mira Press) Mobile Multimedia: Reflections from Ten Years of Practice; Cormier, B., (2018) Copy Culture: Sharing in the Age of Digital Reproduction, , (London: Vamp;A Publishing); Wickens, C.D., Lee, J.D., Liu, Y., Gordon-Becker, S., (2011) An Introduction to Human Factors Engineering, , (India: PHI Publisher); Enyon, R., Helsper, E., Digital natives: Where is the evidence?

In the world of art, life and nature do not only become the source of inspiration, but also become the object of reality that can be responded truthfully. By trying to understand the relation, human may open greater understanding and new imagination of life and nature. Based on this notion, researchers chose salt, one of the most important minerals on earth, as the main focus of this paper. Salt, as a source of life and energy, is essential for all living creatures and humankind. It is an important element and commodity of human life and civilisation in the world. Using a practice-based research and experimental art as its methods, this research will focus on how salt as object can be seen as a subject of art. This exploration intended to verify researchers’ contemplation that art and science can be explored without boundaries of scientific perspective. Through this study, researchers worked in team to find answer about life through salt philosophically, one as an artist and one as an observer. Therefore, this research can become a new mixture of practice-based study between artist and observer, also new perspective of contemporary visual between art and science. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Contemporary art; Exploration; Life; Nature; Salt",,,,,,,"Puspitasari, D., (2013) Jurnal Dimensi, 11, p. 40; Puspitasari, D., (2013) Jurnal Dimensi, 11, p. 26; Candy, L., (2006) Practice Based Research: A Guide, p. 3. , CCS Report VI; Kaprow, A., (2003) Essays on the Blurring of Art and Life, pp. 68-69. , University of California Press, London; Kowan, A.M., Deep sea hydrothermal vents (2013) National Geographic Education, , http://education.nationalgeographic.org/media/deepsea-hydrothermal-vents/, edited by Julie Brown, National Geographic Society, March; Oparin, A.I., (2003) The Origin of Life on Earth, , Dover Publication Inc.

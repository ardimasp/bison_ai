The secondary data was obtained through literature review. Data was subjected to factor analysis and then correlated to each other. The results show that in general the correlation between the components of socioeconomic backgrounds and entrepreneurial characteristics of the women traders was very low, as indicated by a score below 0.5. Among the lowest correlation scores, the highest was the correlation score between age (in socioeconomic backgrounds) and leadership (entrepreneurial characteristics) with a score of 0.279, which means age had 27.9% correlation to leadership. Therefore, it can be concluded that the older the women traders, the higher the level of their leadership. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Entrepreneurial characteristics; Socioeconomic backgrounds; Traditional markets; Women traders",,,,,,"Chavez, G., Entrepreneurial characteristics amongst women microentrepreneurs (2005) Paliparan.

This phenomenon makes urgent need in society about good animation that can appeal to the audience, basically in 3D animation. The purpose of this study is to provide recommendations style for developing an animation work by comparing realistic or iconic 3D animation styles that can appeal to the audience. The study of this paper uses the qualitative method from secondary data in the previous study about uncanny valley style animation, and the author makes comparison study about good animation has appeal in society. The result of this research is expected into the recommendation production process for development 3D animated film between realistic and iconic style development. The conclusion of this research is that the iconic style is better than the realistic style for development 3D animation film, especially for the growing economy country. © 2019 IEEE.","animation; appeal; iconic; production; realistic; uncanny valley","Computation theory; Economics; Landforms; Motion pictures; Production; Sustainable development; appeal; Comparison study; iconic; National economy; Production process; Qualitative method; realistic; Uncanny valley; Animation",,,,,"ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by the Animation Program, Visual Communication Design Department, School of Design, Bina Nusantara University.","(2018) Opus: Creative Economy Outlook 2019, p. 5. , Jakarta: Creative Economy Agency of Republic of Indonesia; (2018) Opus: Creative Economy Outlook 2019, p. 42. , Jakarta: Creative Economy Agency of Republic of Indonesia; (2018) MDEC South East Asia Animation Report, , MDEC, Selangor, Malaysia, rep; Dictionary.com, , https://www.dictionary.com/browse/animation, Animation.

The theory of visual language is used to determine how the visual representation of the form of wayang that use the Space-Time-Plane (STP) system into the game character using the Naturalist-Perspectives-Momentopname (NPM) system. The results of this study indicate that the characters in the game have not been able to move the unique visual language of STP system using by the wayang to the visual language of NPM system in the game.

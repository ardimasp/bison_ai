To be effective, healthcare facilities are mandated to adopt knowledge management in the organization along with the support of the organizational structure and organizational culture within the organization. A private hospital in Tangerang is an example of the healthcare organization with a strong shared-value of professionalism, team-work, empathy, and love within the organization that has become their culture. This private hospital has implemented the knowledge management system and also has its organizational structure changed to be decentralized. Thus, this research aims to find the effect of implementing knowledge management and decentralization on organizational effectiveness which remains unknown. This research used quantitative research methodology in collecting and analyzing data by using SEM-PLS as data analyzing tool. This research conducted at the private hospital in Tangerang with a population of 300 system users. the sampling method used was non-probability purposive sampling. The sample size was determined using Slovin's formula. The survey was conducted of 179 valid respondents consisting of emergency unit personnel, nurses, medical support staff, and administration staff. This study found that Organizational Structure does not affect Organizational Effectiveness. Knowledge Management and Organizational Culture affect Organizational Effectiveness positively and significantly. With R-square value of 0.326, it shows that the independent variables tested can explain 32.6% of the effect towards the dependent variable, while 67.4% explained by other possible variables. © 2020 by Advance Scientific Research.","Knowledge Management; Organizational Culture; Organizational Effectiveness; Organizational Structure",,,,,,"Abbas, J., Saǧsan, M., Impact of knowledge management practices on green innovation and corporate sustainable development: A structural analysis (2019) Journal of Cleaner Production, 229, pp. 611-620. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.024; Agustina, R., Dartanto, T., Sitompul, R., Susiloretni, K.

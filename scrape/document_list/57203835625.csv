There are already several developed NERs dedicated to specific languages such as English, Vietnamese, German, Hindi and many others. However, our research focuses on Indonesian language. Our Indonesian NER is managed to extract the information from articles into 4 different classes; they are Person, Organization, Location, and Event. We provide comprehensive comparison among all experiments by using deep learning approaches. Some discussions related to the results are presented at the end of this paper. Through several conducted experiments, Indonesian NER has successfully achieved a good performance. © 2018 The Authors.

This present study investigated the contributions of word-generating technology in facilitating writers with the discipline-specific words, expressions, and common structure for writing good and engaging research abstracts. Data for this study were a corpus of 956 undergraduate students' English abstracts in Computer Science. AntConc. 3.5.8 (2019) was used as the word-generating tool to identify the words and expressions in Computer Science. The result of this study was the model of abstract as an important written genre in Computer Science, including the use of specific words to present objectivity and epistemic truth. Besides, the framework also provided information on the moves or sections in the abstracts, administering the importance of frame of thinking and corpus in learning. Implications from this research included the use of the model for self-learning and further development in technology use for language education in higher education level.

However, such studies tend to overlook on data and numbers rather than grounded and contextual turn. The present study used a contextual and qualitative analysis to investigate the identities and realities of university graduates through recurring themes and patterns in Twitter. Data for this case study was a corpus compiled from 345 tweets of 35 Twitter accounts of graduates from English Department in a private university in Indonesia. The corpus contained 4, 966 tokens and was analyzed using AntConc.3.5.8 (2019) for the recurring lexical use and collocations. Results showed that university graduates posed themselves as personally engaged, while formal addressing was used in rhetorical style. The graduates were also embalmed with issues related to work, parenting, marriage, and the current pandemic. The corpus also revealed the commonly collegiate style. The use of code-mixing between Indonesian and English in the tweets also further revealed the shared identity of the graduates. It could be concluded that social media postulated the lives and world of graduates and qualitative study of big data analysis could bring more comprehensive results. Implications for educators and university administrators in preparing students for life after university were included in the discussion. © 2020 IEEE.","Big data; Graduates; Identity; Twitter","Big data; Information management; Code-mixing; Indonesia; Qualitative analysis; Qualitative study; Social media; University graduates; Social networking (online)",,,,,,"Cammaerts, B., Social media and activism (2015) Journal of American College Health Publications, 31, pp. 1-8; Felt, M., Social media and the social sciences: How researchers employ big data analytics (2016) Big Data & Society January-June, pp. 1-15; McCormick, T.H., Lee, H., Ceare, N., Shojaie, N., Spiro, E.S., Using twitter for demographic and social science research: Tools for data collection and processing (2015) Sociological Methods & Research, pp. 1-32; Sebei, H., Taieb, M.A.H., Aouicha, M.B., Review of social media analytics process and big data pipeline (2018) Social Network Analysis and Mining, 8, pp. 30-42; Sivarajaha, U., Irania, Z., Guptab, S., Mahroofa, K., Role of big data and social media analytics for business to business sustainability: A participatory web context (2019) Industrial Marketing Management, pp. 2-20. , April; Gutiérrez-Martín, A., Torrego-González, A., The twitter games: Media education, popular culture and multiscreen viewing in virtual concourses (2017) Information, Communication & Society; Noll, M., Technology and the future of the university: A sober view (2000) Information, Communication & Society, 3 (4), pp. 645-647; Armstrong, L., A new game in town: Competitive higher education (2001) Information, Communication & Society, 4 (4), pp. 479-506; Fleming, F., College students' alcohol displays on facebook: Intervention considerations (2012) Journal of American College Health, 60 (5), pp. 388-394; Bennett, L., Segerberg, A., The logic of connective action (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 739-768; Allen, K.A., Ryan, T., Gray-DeLeon, A., McInerenet, D., Waters, L., Social media use and social connectedness in adolescents: The positives and the potential pitfalls (2014) Australian Journal of Educational and Developmental Psychology, 31 (1), pp. 18-31; Jackson, M.H., McDowell, S.D., Enhancing discourse on new technology within higher education (2000) Information, Communication & Society, 3 (4), pp. 629-638; Brown, M.E., Dustman, P.A., Juan, J.B., Twitter impact on a community trauma: An examination of who, what, and why it radiated (2020) Community Psychology, 1, pp. 1-16; Puschmann, C., Burgess, J., (2014) The Politics of Twitter Data, pp. 43-54. , K.

The mobile app was designed to help the students learn the use of specific words, providing definitions and examples of use from authentic sources. The study aimed at identifying points of learning students experienced when using the mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) by answering two questions: first, to what extent students improved their ESAP using MALL and second, how students perceived MALL for studying specific words in Computer Science. Data for this study were collected from 113 Computer Science students enrolled in English for Academic Purposes classes. Two data sets were compiled in this mixed-method study. The first data set consisted of test scores, and the second data set contained transcripts from interviews with students and students’ essays. Findings showed significant learning improvement in the use of MALL to students’ vocabulary knowledge (SD=0.992). Students perceived leaning using MALL to be both positive and rewarding. Interestingly, students revealed the use of MALL could not replace human interactions. Human interactions could enrich students’ understanding and allowed the exchange of ideas. Further implications on human-interactions in MALL and on the future investigation were also discussed.

This case study of university students in Jakarta involved 235 students (128 male, 97 female). Results of this qualitative study showed 96% preference for mobile-based learning. A further 94% showed the needs for collaboration and authenticity for 92%. Hofstede's cultural dimensions were used to identify the gender aspects of MALL. Preference for Masculinity (65%) was showed rather than Femininity (35%), even among the female respondents (70% of the population). Professions and professionalism received strongest preference (70%) while Individuality and Collectivism had equal preferences among students. Both female and male respondents requested Indulgence (84%) for mobile-based learning with more male respondents opted for Indulgence. The study provided a model for this gender sensitive mobile-based learning.

The object of the research is computer-mediated communication of fandom in YouTube video commentaries. The data is analyzed by using Cyberpragmatics approach. The two main objectives of the study are; (1) to observe the process of identity construction through self-presentation and interpersonal relationship within the fandom and (2) to define the characteristics of fandom in YouTube commentaries as online Social Network site. The finding shows that the identity constructions are done by the use of specific nickname and avatar related to the idols. There are two most salient characteristics of online community within the fandom; the active participations and evidence of shared history, culture, norms, and values. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Computer-mediated communication; Cyberpragamtics; Fandom; Social network","History; Online systems; Websites; Computer mediated communication; Cyberpragamtics; Fandom; Interpersonal relationship; On-line communities; On-line social networks; Self presentations; Video commentary; Social networking (online)",,,,,,"Yus, F., (2011) Cyberpragmatics: Internet-Mediated Communication in Context, , 2011.

Sixty-three students from the fifth and seventh semesters of English Department were tested and further observed following reading comprehension tasks. The results showed students used reiteration as their main tool for comprehending different texts. This study also revealed that such strategy or skill was gained through what the students claimed to be ‘logic’. This result suggested the strategy was not gained over covert teaching of English. However, it further implication were to integrate teaching of Reading and Vocabulary with Discourse and a more explicit discussion to be beneficial to further students confidence in English. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Discourse; Lexical cohesion; Reading; Reiteration; Vocabulary",,,,,,,"Halliday, M.A.K., Hasan, R., (2013) Cohesion in English, , Routledge, London; McCarthy, M., (1991) Discourse Analysis for Language Teachers, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; McH Sinclair, J., Coulthard, R.M., (1975) Towards an Analysis of Discourse, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Gear, J., Gear, R., (2009) Cambridge Preparation for the Ibt TOEFL, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Chung, J.S.L., (2008) System, 28, p. 247; William, R., (1983) Reading in Foreign Language, 1, p. 35; Thornbury, S., (2005) Beyond the Sentence: Introducing Discourse Analysis, , Macmillan, Oxford; William, R., (1983) Reading in Foreign Language, 1, p. 35; Llach, M.P.A., Jimenez, R.M., (2007) International Journal of English Studies, 7, p. 85; Eckerth, J., Tavakoli, P., (2012) Language Teaching Research, 16, p. 227; Palmer, J.C., (1999) RELC Journal, 30, p. 61; Mojica, L.A., (2006) The Asia-Pacific Education Research, 15, p. 105; He, Q., (2014) International Journal of Linguistics, 6, p. 46; Kafes, H., (2012) English Language Teaching, 5, p. 83","Simanjuntak, R.R.; English Department, Indonesia",,,"American Scientific Publishers",,,,,19366612,,,,"English","Adv.

Seventy English learners from a university in Indonesia were involved in this study. Samples of learners’ speech were analysed using Praat and analysed against Pierrehumbert’s tonal model. The results revealed different stress/pitch patterns and intonational contour, with some segmental errors. It was also revealed that possible factors influencing the inner speech come from valorisation of English. This study argues that an ideal assessment model should incorporate learners’ inner speech, analysis of learners speech production and lecturers’ observation. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Assessment; Inner speech; Pierrehumbert; Praat; Speech production",,,,,,,"Barac, R., (2012) Child Development, 83, p. 413; Bernstein, B., (1961) Social Class and Linguistic Development: A Theory of Social Learning, Education, Economy and Society, pp. 288-314. , edited by A.

Cloud computing has many advantages, particularly the ability to allocate on-demand resources without the need to build a specialized infrastructure or perform major maintenance. However, one of the problems faced by the researcher is the availability of computer tools to perform research. Docker is a lightweight virtualization for developers that can be used to build, ship, and run a range of distributed applications. This paper describes how Docker is deployed within a platform for bioinformatics computing. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.","Cloud computing; Docker; Research; Virtualization","Big data; Bioinformatics; Cloud computing; Intelligent systems; Research; Soft computing; Virtual reality; Computer tools; Distributed applications; Docker; On demands; Virtualizations; Intelligent computing",,,,,"Zhang, Q., Cheng, L., Boutaba, R., Cloud computing: State-of-the-art and research challenges (2010) J.

So that it can be a reference for each individual to gain knowledge without having to depend on other individuals, with the hope, in the future, the management of this knowledge will facilitate access and use of this knowledge. Common understanding occurs because the author observes that the affiliated organization has not yet optimized the effectiveness of existing knowledge management. The observation that the author did, the author tries to make observations or investigations related to the ability to survive knowledge management and the performance of this organization to the infrastructure of knowledge effects, which, according to the author, correlate with the performance with affiliated the educational institution.

The old method adaptation depend mostly on the calculations estimatations of probabilities and financial loss during a security breach. The purpose of this paper is to propose alternative ways to conduct risk analysis for small companies. Risk analysis defined in the paper is an analysis to identify such comprehensive risks set by concentrating by equal to the information and technology also not undermine the people and process area too. This method considers the essential business processes that focus for the relevance of the analysis. Crucial items for this practice consist of business-driven studies for identify relevant IT assets and risk method scenarios for capturing procedure details, and security.

Corona virus causes various diseases in mammals, birds ranging from enteritis in cattle, pigs, and chickens. Corona has problems such as respiratory diseases for infections in humans that cause death in infected R & D. In this study. We provide a brief introduction about Coronavirus that discusses the predictive results of spreading the Corona Virus to any country. We will also consider an outbreak of Coronavirus where the results we have found will find a solution for the future so that this virus does not spread widely to various countries. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

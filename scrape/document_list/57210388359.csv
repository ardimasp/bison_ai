This study, therefore, aims to identify the target fish catch based on the fishing season using local, domestic, and international reef marketing systems. This research was conducted from January to April (west monsoon season) and May to November 2019 (east monsoon season). The results showed that Lutjanidae (6 species), Serranidae (8 species), Prettodidae (1 species), Haemulidae (1 species), Caesionidae (1 species), Ostraciidae (1 species), Mullidae (6 species), Labridae (2 species), Siganidae (3 species), Holocentridae (1 species), Lethrinidae (7 species ), Symphysanodontidae (1 species), Chaetodontidae (1 species), Platycephalidae (1 species) and Nemipteridae (3 species) are the identified genera of fishes found in coastal waters of the Spelman Strait. During the west monsoon season, fishermen use the hook sizes numbered 5 and 8 to catch a large size fishes of the Serranidae and Lutjanidae families, and in the east monsoon season, hook sizes of 15, 16, 17 are utilized for catching small fish species. These reef fishes are internationally marketed in other Asian countries such as Singapore, Taiwan, and China. © 2020, BIOFLUX SRL.

Therefore this study aims to analyze with a systematic and empirical approach of the social media usage (Including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) by DKI Jakarta governor candidates for the 2017-2022 period. Based on the observations, we found that each DKI Jakarta governor candidate has had a popular social media account in Indonesia, namely Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Such media were used to in conducting political campaigns and interacting with their constituents. Based on in-depth analysis of the empirical data showed that the presence of social media in the political campaigns in Indonesia had a strong relationship with the final results of DKI Jakarta governor election. Relationship between the results of the general election and the popularity, participation, and activeness of candidates in using social media were shown not only in interaction quantity but also in quality of the political campaign contents. Furthermore social media popularity of the political parties which supported the candidates allegedly had a relationship with 2017 DKI Jakarta governor election results. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Constituents; General Election; Iinteraction and Mobility; Political Campaigns; Social Media",,,,,,,"Aparaschivei, P.A., The Use of New Media in Electoral Campaigns: Analysis on the Use of Blogs, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the 2009 Romanian Presidential Campaign (2011) Journal of Media Research, 4 (2); Asp, K., Esaiasson, P., The Modernization of Swedish Campaign: Individualization, Profesionalization, and Medialization in Swanson and Paolo Mancini (1996) Politics, Media, and Modern Democracy: An International Study of Innovations in Electoral Campaigning and Their Consequences, , Wesport: Praeger; Digrazia, J., McKelvey, K., Bollen, J., Rojas, “More tweets, more votes: Social media as a quantitative indicator of political behavior (2013) Plos One, 8 (11); (2002) Handbook of International and Intercultural Communications, , 2nd edition), California: Sage Publications Inc; Juditha, C., Political Marketing dan Media Sosial (Studi Political Marketing Capres RI 2014 Melalui Facebook) (2014) Jurnal Studi Komunikasi Dan Media, 19 (2), pp. 225-241; Kirtis, A.K., Karahan, F., To be or not to be in social media arena as the most cost-efficient marketing strategy after the global recession (2011) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 24, pp. 260-268; Konstituen: Pilar Utama Partai Politik by Friedrich Naumann-Stiftung Untuk Kebebasan (FNF) on Scribd; Labolo, M., Ilham, T., Partai Politik dan Sistem Pemilihan Umum di Indonesia (2015) Depok: Rajagrafindo Persada; (1999) Rich Media, Poor Democracy; Communication Politics in Dubious Times”, , New York: The New Press; Literasi Internet dan Partisipasi Politik Masyarakat Pemilih dalam Aktifitas Pemanfaatan Media Baru (2012) Jurnal Studi Komunikasi Dan Media, 16 (1), pp. 1-15; (2008) Blogwars”, , Oxford University Press; (2009) Political Blogging and Campaign: A Roundtable”, Sage Publications, Press/Politics, 13 (2), pp. 160-170; Vissers, Q., The Effect of Internet Use on Political Participation: An Analysis of Survey Results for 16-Year-Olds in Belgium” (2009) Social Science Computer Review, 26 (4), pp. 411-427. , Sage Publication; Television news and candidate fortunes in presidential nomination campaigns: The case of 1984 (1992) American Politics Quarterly, 20 (1), pp. 69-98; Political branding Jokowi selama masa kampanye Pemilu Gubernur DKI Jakarta 2012 di media sosial twitter (2013) Jurnal E-Komunikasi, 1 (2); Menimbang media sosial dalam marketing politik di Indonesia: Belajar dari Jokowi-Ahok di Pilkada DKI Jakarta 2012 (2013) Jurnal Ilmu Sosial Dan Ilmu Politik, 17 (1), pp. 67-84; Dijck, V., Users like you?

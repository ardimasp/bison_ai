All those attendance system have several weakness, especially to control of employees who work outside the office. In this paper we introduced a attendance system that can be used to record the attendance of employees who are duty outside the building. Our system is also integrated with payroll system that make accounting department can easily calculate and report the salary included the overtime cost. The proposed attendance system used smartphone to verify the employee. The system provide two options for doing verification, such as fingerprint and voice recognition. In this research, we find that fingerprint verification has false positive 95% and the false negative of voice recognition is 5.88%. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Compensation (personnel); Palmprint recognition; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Speech recognition; Wages; Attendance systems; Complicated systems; False negatives; False positive; Fingerprint verification; Overtime costs; Payroll systems; Pattern recognition",,,,,"Jain, A., Ross, A., Prabhakar, S., Fingerprint matching using minuate and texture (2001) International Conference on Image Processing, pp. 282-285. , Greece, Oct 7-10; Jain, A.K., Hong, L., Pankanti, S., Bolle, R., An identity authentication system using fingerprints (1997) Proceedings of the IEEE, 85 (9), p. 13651388; Shoewu, O., Idowu, O.A., Development of attendance management system using biometrics (2012) The Pacific Journal of Science and Technology, 13 (1). , May; Rao, S., Satoa, K.J., An attendance monitoring system using biometrics authentication (2013) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science and Software Engineering, 3 (4). , April; Josphineleela, R., Ramakrishnan, M., An efficient automatic attendance system using fingerprint reconstruction technique (2012) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, 10 (3). , March; Masalha, F., Hirzallah, N., A students attendance system using QR code (2014) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 5 (3); Ashok Kumarl, D., Ummal Sariba-Begum, T., A comparative study on fingerprint matching algorithms for EVM (2013) Journal of Computer Sciences and Applications, 4 (1), pp. 55-60; Soewito, B., Echo, W.M.S., Gunawan, I.P., Absence system using your own device (2015) Advanced Science Letters, 21 (4), pp. 638-642; Soewito, B., Lumban Gaol, F., Echo, W.M.S., Gunawan, F.E., Attendance system on android smartphone (2015) International Conference on Control, Electronics, Renewable Energy and Communications, ICCEREC, pp. 208-211; Wieclaw, L., A minutiae-based matching algorithms in fingerprint recognition systems (2009) Journal of Medical Informatics and Technologies, 13, pp. 65-71; (2005) Social Security Numbers = de Facto National ID Card, , http://www.lawschooldiscussion.org/index.php?topic=3003458.0, December [Online] [Accessed: 23-May- 2013]; Reynolds, D.A., An overview of autmatic speaker recognition technology (1999) International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, , ICASSP May 2002.

The first is the long queues in front of the attendace machine at the time to come to work and leave work. The second is cheating, employees can ask her/his friend to do attendance process. The third is mostly attendance system has not been connected with the payment system in human resouces software or in the finance department. The fourth, employees who work outside the office can not do attendance process. In this paper, we introduced an attendance system based finger print technology and GPS using a smartphone integrated with payment system that will eliminate all the problems above. Our research also based on prediction that in the next few year all the smart phone will have a fingerprint scanner. © 2015 IEEE.","Accuracy; Fingerprint recognition; Global Positioning System; Manuals; Renewable energy sources; Servers; Smart phones","Android (operating system); Global positioning system; Pattern recognition; Renewable energy resources; Servers; Signal encoding; Telephone sets; Accuracy; Android smartphone; Attendance systems; Finance department; Fingerprint Recognition; Fingerprint scanners; Manuals; Renewable energy source; Smartphones",,,,,"Ashbourn, J., (2000) Biometrics: Advanced Identity Verification: The Complete Guide, , Springer-Verlag, London, Springer; Wayman, J.L., Alyea, L., (2000) Picking the Best Biometric for Your Applications, pp. 269-275. , National Biometric Test Center Collected Works.

In the other hand, we know that everyone has the mobile devices and all the mobile devices will be embedded a finger scanner in the future. In this paper, we proposed the absence system using your own device. We used the finger scanner and coordinate Global Position System (GPS) as inputs for the absence system that integrated with payroll system and human resource management tools. We developed our application base on android platform because the android is the most platforms that have been using in the most mobile devices. Using our proposed methodology, the employee can do attendance using their mobile devices and they do not need to be in queue and the employee who work outside the office also can do the attendance. Our research showed that our proposed methodology can used for the next generation absence system. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

In this empirical paper, business competitiveness of the service provider's logistics companies comprises facets relating to quality and delivery of their products to the customers. Besides, as far as faster product delivery to the customers is concerned, this can be ascribed to the extensive sales and distribution networks established by the top twenty service provider's logistics companies in Indonesia. The methodology of this study depends on the Meta-analysis, whereby the results reveal a positive effect of supply chain management practices, as viewed by the respondents of the service provider's logistics companies on business performance. Such positive effects of supply chain management practices on both business competitiveness and customer satisfaction are validated by prior studies as well, who observe that when activities are performed in sync with both suppliers and customers, it would significantly leverage firm business competencies as well as customer satisfaction. This also finds the echo in the study arguing that a long-term collaborative relationship with suppliers facilitate in garnering positive results in an array of activities as reflected in superior product quality, diminished length of lead time, prompt customer service. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Business performance; Customer satisfaction; Logistics companies; Management practices; Supply chain",,,,,,"Abdul Hadi, A., Hussain, H.I., Suryanto, T., Yap, T., Bank's performance and its determinants: evidence from Middle East, Indian sub-continent and African banks (2018) Polish Journal of Management Studies, 17; Ahire, S.L., O'Shaughnessy, K.C., The role of top management commitment in quality management: an empirical analysis of the auto parts industry (2000) International Journal of Quality Science, 3 (1), pp. 5-37; Alvarado, U.Y., Kotzab, H., Supply chain management: the integration of logistics in marketing (2001) Industrial Marketing Management, 30 (2), pp. 183-198; Ali, A., Haseeb, M., Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology as a strategic tool towards higher performance of supply chain operations in textile and apparel industry of Malaysia (2019) Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 7 (2), pp. 215-226; Ansari, A., Supplier product integration-a new competitive approach (1999) Production and Inventory Management Journal, 40 (3), p. 57; Autry, C.W., Grawe, S.J., Daugherty, P.J., Richey, R.G., The effects of technological turbulence and breadth on supply chain technology acceptance and adoption (2010) Journal of Operations Management, 28, pp. 522-536; (2005) Criteria for Performance Excellence, United States Department of Commerce, , National Institute of Standards and Technology, Technology Administration, Gaithersburg, MD; Bemowski, K., Motorola's fountain of youth (1995) Quality Progress, 28 (10), pp. 29-31; Bowersox, D.J., Closs, D.J., Stank, T.P., Ten mega-trends that will revolutionise supply chain logistics (2000) Journal of Business Logistics, 21 (2), pp. 1-15; Bozarth, C.C., Warsing, D.P., Flynn, B.B., Flynn, E.J., The impact of supply chain complexity on manufacturing plant performance (2009) Journal of Operations Management, 27, pp. 78-93; Burgess, K., Singh, P.J., Koroglu, R., Supply chain management: a structured literature review and implications for future research (2006) International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 26 (7), pp. 703-729; Cagliano, R., Caniato, F., Spina, G., The linkage between supply chain integration and manufacturing improvement programmes (2006) International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 26 (3), pp. 282-299; Callen, J.L., Fader, C., Krinsky, I., Just in time: a cross-sectional plant analysis (2000) International Journal of Production Economics, 63, pp. 277-301; Chandra, C., Kumar, S., Supply chain management in theory and practice: A fad or a fundamental change?

The study also examines the role of the corporate life cycle of Islamic banks in influencing the relationship between management accounting–strategy coalignment and performance. Design/methodology/approach: Management accounting practices, management control systems, strategy and maqasid Shariah-based performance are measured using questionnaires which were distributed to 97 directors and heads of Islamic banks. The model of this study is analyzed using structural equation model. Findings: This study finds that the coalignment between low cost-oriented strategy, strategic management accounting practices and mechanistic management control system has positive impact on improving maqasid Shariah-based performance. However, this study is unable to verify that corporate life cycle strengthens the positive relationship between management accounting–strategy coalignment and performance. Research limitations/implications: Limited indicators of management accounting practices in this study illustrate less comprehensive management accounting practices. Further studies may add other relevant management accounting as described by the International Federation of Accounting Committee to provide a more comprehensive management accounting practices. Practical implications: This study provides recommendations to the management of Islamic banks to design management accounting practices and management control systems that fit to their strategic orientation. Originality/value: This paper fulfils limited empirical studies on management accounting practices and strategy in Islamic banking industry. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Coalignment; Islamic banking; Management accounting; Management control system; Maqasid Shariah; Strategy",,,,,,"Abdel-Kader, M., Luther, R., The impact of firm characteristics on management accounting practice: a UK-based empirical analysis (2008) The British Accounting Review, 40 (1), pp. 2-27; Abdul Rasid, S.Z., Rahman, A.R.A., Wan Ismail, W.K., Management accounting systems in Islamic and conventional financial institutions in Malaysia (2011) Journal of Islamic Accounting and Business Research, 2 (2), pp. 153-176; Ahmad, K., The use of management accounting practices in Malaysian SMEs (2012) Dissertation, , University of Exeter; Ahmad, M.M., Pandey, D., (2010) 10th Global Conference on Business and Economics, , Are Islamic bank better immunized than conventional banksthe current economic crisis?, Italy: 15-16 October; Aisthorpe, P., Hudson, R., Keasey, K., A new approach to linking strategy formulation and strategy implementation: an example from the UK banking sector (2000) International Journal of Information Management, 20 (6), pp. 411-428; Alaudin, A., Adler, R.W., Theivananthampillai, P., (2010) Accounting and Finance Association of Australia and New Zealand Conference, , Management control systems, fairness, and trust: evidence from Malaysian Islamic bank; Allen, R.S., Helms, M., Takeda, M., White, C., Porter’s generic strategies: an exploratory study of their use in Japan (2007) Journal of Business Strategies, 9 (1), pp. 69-90; Anthony, J.H., Ramesh, K., Association between accounting performance measures and stock prices (1992) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 15 (2-3), pp. 203-227; Ascarya, A., Yumanita, D., (2005) Mencari solusi rendahnya pembiayaan bagi hasil di perbankan syariah di Indonesia, , Buletin Ekonomi dan Moneter BI, June; Auda, J., (2007) Maqasid Al-Shariah as Philosophy of Islamic Law: A Systems Approach, , The International Institute of Islamic Thought, London; Auzair, S., Langfield-Smith, K., The effect of service process type, business strategy and life cycle stage on bureaucratic MCS in service organizations (2005) Management Accounting Research, 16 (4), pp. 299-421; Auzair, S., Amirudin, R., Abdul Majid, A., Maelah, R., (2013) Journal Pengurusan, 37, pp. 45-52. , Linking business strategy to management accounting: a studyMalaysian service organization, Vol; Barney, J.B., Is the resource-based “view” a useful perspective for strategic management research?

Design/methodology/approach: This study used a mix of qualitative methods—using focus group discussions (FGDs) to select key variables affecting PMD and to validate the research findings—and quantitative methods—using structural equation modeling (SEM) to test eight hypotheses developed from FGDs and from a literature review. Out of 340 questionnaires sent out to potential participants, 260 were returned and deemed valid for SEM analysis, reflecting a satisfactory response rate of 76%. Findings: A total of six factors affecting PMD were identified: quasi-legal constraint (QLC), powerful outside forces (POFs), inertial forces (IFs), powerful inside forces (PIFs), power base (PB), and political acumen (PA). The SEM analysis indicated that QLC, PIF, PB, and PA enhance PMD, while IF tends to inhibit PMD. Stronger PMD was associated with weaker RTB on the part of government-official decision makers, while greater RTB was associated with more positive organizational outcomes. These findings are partially consistent with prior findings, with some notable contradictions. Research implications/limitations: The primary limitation of this study was its limited external validity, as these findings can only be extended to organizations with similar characteristics of those of the government institution used as the case study. These findings must be used with care for different types of public organizations. Practical implications: These findings support taking the following steps: (1) review and remove equivocal regulations that could restrain PMD, (2) streamline bureaucracy, (3) establish regulations that allow more space for innovation and discretion, (4) delineate the tasks and responsibilities of decision makers, and (5) discourage abrupt policy changes, promoting proper scrutiny and notice. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Focus group discussion; government organizations; perceived managerial discretion; risk-taking behavior; structural equation model",,,,,,"Andrews, K., (1971) The concept of corporate strategy, , Homewood, IL: Dow Jones-Irwin Ansoff; Atkinson, R., Project management: Cost, time and quality, two best guesses and a phenomenon, its time to accept other success criteria (1999) International Journal of Project Management, 17 (6), pp. 337-342; Barney, J.B., (2007) Gaining and sustaining competitive advantage, , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall; Bromiley, P., Testing a causal model of corporate risk taking and performance (1991) Academy of Management Journal, 34 (1), pp. 37-59; Carpenter, M., Golden, B., Perceived managerial discretion: A study of cause and effect (1997) Strategic Management Journal, 18 (3), pp. 187-206; Caza, A., Testing alternate predictions for the performance consequences of middle managers’ discretion (2011) Human Resource Management, 50 (1), pp. 9-28; Chang, E.C., Wong, S.M.L., Managerial discretion and firm performance in China’s listed firms (2003) Working Paper No. 1036, , Hong Kong: University of Hong Kong; Child, J., Organizational structure, environment and performance: The role of strategic choice (1972) Sociology, 6 (1), pp. 1-22; Daft, R.L., (2000) Organization theory and design, , Mason, OH: Cengage Learning; Eckerson, W.W., (2006) Performance dashboards: Measuring, monitoring and managing your business, , Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley and Sons; Finkelstein, S., Hambrick, D.C., Top management team tenure and organizational outcomes: The moderating role of managerial discretion (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35 (3). , halaman; Finkelstein, S., Hambrick, D.C., Cannella, J.A., (2009) Strategic leadership: Theory and research on executives, top management teams, and boards, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Fischer, R., (2000) Sources of conflict and methods of conflict resolution, , Kota: International Peace and Conflict, School of International Service, American University, Washington, DC; Hair, J., Anderson, R., Tatham, R., Black, W.C., (1998) Multivariate data analysis, , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall; Haleblian, J., Finikelstein, S., Top management team size, CEO dominance and firm performance: The moderating roles of environmental turbulence and discretion (1993) Academy of Management Journal, 36 (4), pp. 844-863; Hambrick, D., Upper echelons theory: An update (2007) Academy of Management Review, 32 (2), pp. 334-343; Hambrick, D., Cannella, J.A., CEOs who have COOs: Contingency analysis of an unexplored structural form (2004) Strategic Management Journal, 25. , 959–979; Hambrick, D., Finkelstein, S., (1987) Managerial discretion: A bridge between polar views of organizational outcomes, , Greenwich, CT: JAI Press; Hambrick, D.C., Abrahamson, E., Assessing managerial discretion across industries: A multimethod approach (1995) Academy of Management Journal, 38 (5), pp. 1427-1441; Hannan, M.T., Freeman, J., The population ecology of organizations (1977) The American Journal of Sociology, 82 (5), pp. 929-964; Hayward, M., Hambrick, D., Explaining the premiums paid for large acquisitions: Evidence of CEO hubris (1997) Administrative Science Quarterly, 42 (1), pp. 103-127; Hiller, N., Hambrick, D., Conceptualizing executive hubris: The role of (hyper) core self-evaluations in strategic decision-making (2005) Strategic Management Journal, 26 (4), pp. 297-319; Janis, I.J., Mann, L., (1977) Decision-making: A psychological analysis of conflict, choice and commitment, , New York, NY: Free Press; Jenkin, M., Ambrosini, V., Collier, N., (2007) Advanced strategic management: A multiple perspective approach, , London, UK: Palgrave McMillan; Kahneman, D., Tversky, A., Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk (1979) Econometrica, 47 (2), pp. 263-291; Kahneman, D., Tversky, A., Conflict resolution: A cognitive perspective (1995) Barriers to conflict resolution, , Arrows R.H.K., (ed), New York, NY: Norton, &,.

Design/methodology/approach—A total of 518 supervisors representing 222 business unit of Indonesia Electricity Company completed an online survey questionnaire measuring their responses to six constructs which explain the relationship among technology adoption determinant factors in organization: cast enactment (leadership), transformational enactment (entrepreneurship), absorptive capability, technology adoption and unit performance. A structural equation modeling (SEM) approach using LISREL 8.7 was employed for modeling and data analysis. Findings—Results revealed that the absorptive capability is one of technology adoption determinant factors that significantly enhance unit’s performance indirectly. Among entrepreneurial leadership variables, cast enactment (leadership) is less effective than transformational enactment (entrepreneurship) to affect the unit’s absorptive capability for the successful technology adoption. Leadership does not affect both technology adoption and absorptive capability directly. While entrepreneurship’s effect to technology adoption is indirect; it is mediated by absorptive capability. In addition, three out of six hypotheses were supported in this study. The CFA test of the measurement model and GOFI values of significance tests from the analysis of the structural model show that the overall fit of the structural model is good. Overall, the data in this study provided support that the hypothetical model is a fairly efficient with a potential to help in understanding technology adoption perceived of managers in Indonesia. Originality/value—The model is a well-tested and valid to explain the role of entrepreneurial leadership and absorptive capability to the technology adoption for enhancing unit’s performance. The study empirically proved that technology adoption is a functional competence/capability mediating absorptive capability with unit’s performance. This study also validated the model on a sample of utility company managers in Indonesia and the results provided initial support for the determinant factors variability of the technology adoption in intra-firm context. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Absorptive capability; Entrepreneurial leadership; Technology adoption; TOE framework",,,,,,"Aarons, G.A., Sommerfeld, D.H., (2012) Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 4 (423), p. 51; Adewoje, J.O., Akanbi, T.A., (2012) Journal of Emerging Trends in Economics and Management Sciences (JETEMS), 3, p. 64; Amlaku, A., Solkner, J., Puskur, R., Wurzinger, M., (2012) International Journal of Agriscience, 2, p. 1062; David, B., Link, D., (2012) The Journal of Technology Transfer, 1 (1), p. 37; Hall, B.H., Khan, B., (2002) Adoption of New Technology, , New Economy Handbook: Hall and Khan; Butler, D.L., Sellbom, M., (2002), Educause Quarterly; Eisenhardt, K.M., Martin, J.A., (2000) Strategic Management Journal, p. 1105. , (Wiley- Blackwell); Moore, G.C., Benbazat, I., (2001) Information System Research, p. 2; Hitt, M.A., (2006) Strategic Management; Competitiveness and Globalization— Concepts, , 2nd Canadian edn., Thomson Nelson; Jaskyte, K., (2004) Nonprofit Management and Leadership, 2 (153), p. 15; McCardle, K.F., (1985) Management Science, p. 31; Watengere, K., Advance Journal of Food (2010) Science and Technology, p. 2; Lynskey, M.J., Yonekura, S., (2002) Entrepreneurship and Organization: The Role of The Entrepreneur in Organizational Innovation, , Oxford University Press; Makri, M., Scandura, T.A., (2010) The Leadership Quarterly, 1 (75), p. 21; Capozzi, M.M., (2010) Leadership and Innovation, Development Outreach July 2010, , World Bank Institute; Bressler, M.S., Bressler, L.A., Bressler, M.E., (2011) Academy of Enterpreneurship Journal, p. 17; Matzler, K., (2008) Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 2 (139), p. 21; McDaniel, B.A., (2000) The Social Science Journal, 2 (277), p. 37; Pettus, M.L., Kor, Y.Y., Mahoney, J.T., (2009) International Journal Strategic Change Management, p. 1; Pan, M.-J., Jang, W.-Y., The Journal of Computer Information Systems 48 (2008) Proquest, p. 94; Morris, M.H., Entrepreneurial Intensity (1998) Sustainable Advantages for Individuals, Organizations and Societies, , Quorum, Westport, CT; Jawabreh, O., Allaham, M., Alrjoub, A., (2012) Ahmad, International Journal of Business and Management, p. 7; Lee, O.-K., Wang, M., Lim, K.H., Peng, Z., (2009) Journal of Global Information System, 17, p. 70; Mirvis, P.H., (1991) Human Resources Management, 30, p. 113; Borins, S., (2002) Leadership and Organization Development Journal, 23, pp. 467-476; Wijanto, S.H., (2008) Structural Equation Modelling with LISREL, 880. , Graha Ilmu Jakarta, Indonesia; Shaw, E., O’Loughlin, A., McFadzean, E., (2005) European Journal of Innovation Management, 4 (393), p. 8; Stoker, J.I., (2001) International Journal of Human Resource Management, 7 (1141), p. 12; Teece, D.J., (2007) Strategic Management Journal, 28, p. 1319. , (John Wiley & Sons); Oliveira, T., Martins, M.F., (2011) The Electronic Journal Information Systems Evaluation, 14, p. 110; Wang, C.L., Ahmed, P.K., (2007) The International Journal of Management Reviews, 9, p. 31; Zhao, F., (2005) International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behavior and Research, 11, p. 1125","Arifin, Z.; PLN IndonesiaIndonesia",,,"American Scientific Publishers",,,,,19366612,,,,"English","Adv.

Using 518 respondents representing 222 business units of Indonesia’s electricity company, the study found that only the absorptive capability has a positively significant effect on technology adoption. Practically, the study emphasizes that without the absorptive capability for managing the resource, the core competence of a firm will not occur and the adoption of technology will be less effective. Another finding is the absorptive capability’s typology mapping the eight technology adoption statuses in an organization, based on three of the determinant factors: the externalities, entrepreneurial leadership and slack resources. © 2016, Gadjah Mada University.

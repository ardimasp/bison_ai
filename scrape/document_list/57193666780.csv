This paper presents a hybrid user-collaborative, rule-based filtering recommendation system for education context. User profiles are represented by learning outcome scores and contextual information. The user-collaborative filtering method is used for predicting the targeted student’s learning outcome of a particular course. The predicted learning outcome combined with a set of decision rules are used for recommending some relevant link of learning materials to the targeted student. The initial contextual information which is assessed during the online program entrance test makes it possible for the proposed recommneder system to give automated recommendations to new students. The proposed method was tested using student learning outcome records from BINUS Online repository data. The results of performance evaluation of both recommender system with contextual information which achieves 458.22 MSE and the recommender system without contextual information which achieves 413.19 MSE are not significantly different. However, unlike the latter recommender system, the former recommender system has an advantage mainly that it can be used to give recommendation to the targeted students since their early program stage. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Collaborative filtering; Contextual information; Multi-criteria; Online learning; Recommendation system",,,,,,,"Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: A survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions (2005) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 17 (6), pp. 734-749; Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., (2015) Context-Aware Recommender Systems, pp. 191-226. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4899-7637-6_6, Second ed., Recommender systems handbook; Aher, S.B., Lobo, L.M.R.J., Course (2012) Recommender System in E-Learning, 3 (1), pp. 159-164; Anandakumar, K., Rathipriya, K., Bharathi, A., A Survey on methodologies for personalized (2014) E-Learning Recommender Systems, pp. 4738-4743; Benhamdi, S., Babouri, A., Chiky, R., Personalized recommender system for E-learning environment (2017) Education and Information Technologies, 22 (4), pp. 1455-1477; Bozzon, A., Prandi, G., Valenzise, G., Tagliasacchi, M., A music recommendation system based on semantic audio segments similarity (2008) Proceedings of the IASTED International Conference on Internet and Multimedia Systems and Applications and Visual Communications, pp. 182-187; Cami, B.R., Hassanpour, H., Mashayekhi, H., (2017) A content-based movie recommender system based on temporal user preferences, pp. 121-125. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPIS.2017.8311601; Collins, A.D., Tkaczyk, A., Aizawabeel, J., (2018) A Study of Position Bias in Digital Library Recommender Systems, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06565, February; Corbi, A., Burgos, D., Review of current student-monitoring techniques used in ELearning-focused recommender systems and learning analytics.

Visible Light Communication (VLC) arose as an effective option for data communication. Light Fidelity (Li- Fi) is one of VLC technologies and represents a new technique operating with light signals in order to transmit data a source to a destination. It guarantees several benefits and can overcome different limitations of Wi-Fi technologies including security issues, media obstacles, and radio interference. Li-Fi technologies are adopted for experimental usage and does not extensively arise in industry. The adoption of Li-Fi technology in industry, it is necessary to measure the performance of data transmission several data types requiring to be supported. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the performance of data communication using VLC. This research is based on an implementation for different types of data transmission through Li-Fi. The methodology that has been adopted for this study consists on a simulation topology by NS-3 which has been built to study the performance TCP and UDP protocols in Li-Fi environment for VLC communication. Various types of data have been transmitted through an appropriate designed model. The simulation results show the differences between the two common algorithms. The implementation explained the needs for Li-Fi data transmission. Indeed, this work show a successful audio, text, and images transfer through VLC technology. © 2020 IEEE.","Data Transmission; Li-Fi; NS-3; TCP; UDP; VLC","Convolutional codes; Data handling; Data transfer; Light; Radio interference; Radio transmission; Communication technologies; Data-communication; Designed models; Radio signals; Security issues; Transmit data; Visible light communications (VLC); Wi-Fi - Technology; Visible light communication",,,,,"UKM grant FRGS/1/2018/TK04/UKM/02/07 and DCP-2018-040","Bakar, K.A.A., Putri, D.S.D., Design of location based authentication system using visible light communication (2017) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 95 (1), pp. 147-154; Singh, G., Li-fi (light fidelity)-an overview to future wireless technology in field of data communication (2015) Journal of Network Communications and Emerging Technologies (JNCET), 5 (1); Bao, X., Yu, G., Dai, J., Zhu, X., Li-Fi: Light fidelity-a survey (2015) Wireless Networks, 21 (6), pp. 1879-1889; Tsonev, D., Videv, S., Haas, H., Light fidelity (Li-Fi): Towards all-optical networking (2014) Broadband Access Communication Technologies VIII, 9007, p. 900702. , International Society for Optics and Photonics; Bhavya, R., Lokesh, M., A survey on li-fi technology (2016) ABHIYANTRIKI: An International Journal of Engineering & Technology, 3 (1), pp. 7-12; Kumar, S.V., Sudhakar, K., Rani, L.S., Emerging technology li-fi over wi-fi (2014) International Journal of Inventive Engineering and Sciences, 2 (3); Hadi, M., Wireless communication tends to smart technology li-fi and its comparison with wi-fi (2016) American Journal of Engineering Research (AJER), 5 (5), pp. 40-47; Johri, R., Li-Fi, complementary to Wi-Fi (2016) 2016 IEEE International Conference on Computation of Power, Energy Information and Commuincation (ICCPEIC), pp. 015-019; Andrade, D., Gomes, J.P., André, P.S., (2019) Implementation of A Visible Light Communication Link: Li-Fi with Smartphone Detection; Dobroslav, T., Nikola, S., (2016) PureLiFi Low-bandwidth PHY and MAC Proposal; Soltani, M.D., Bidirectional optical spatial modulation for mobile users: Toward a practical design for lifi systems (2019) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 37 (9), pp. 2069-2086; Ramananda, D., Sequeira, A.M., Raikar, S.R., Shanbhag, C.K., Design and implementation of lifi communication system (2019) IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 594 (1), p. 012041. , IOP Publishing; Haas, H., Introduction to indoor networking concepts and challenges in LiFi (2020) Journal of Optical Communications and Networking, 12 (2), pp. A190-A203; Riley, G.F., Henderson, T.R., The ns-3 network simulator (2010) Modeling and Tools for Network Simulation, pp. 15-34. , Springer; Aldalbahi, A., Extending ns3 to simulate visible light communication at network-level (2016) 2016 23rd International Conference on Telecommunications (ICT), pp. 1-6; Malik, M., Yaqub, H., Shaheen, R., Najar, M., Chatta, S., (2016) Lifi: The Future for Indoor Wireless Data Communication, , ed; Al-Khatib, A.A., Hassan, R., Performance evaluation of AODV, DSDV, and DSR routing protocols in MANET using NS-2 simulator (2017) International Conference of Reliable Information and Communication Technology, pp. 276-284. , Springer; Ismail, Z., Hassan, R., A performance study of various mobility speed on AODV routing protocol in homogeneous and heterogeneous MANET (2011) IEEE the 17th Asia Pacific Conference on Communications, pp. 637-642",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2nd International Conference on Computer and Information Sciences, ICCIS 2020","13 October 2020 through 15 October 2020",,165301,,9781728154671,,,"English","Int.

From the application that went through very important developments from desktop-based applications to web-based applications to mobile-based applications as the latest development. But maintenance of mobile applications will be done more often, because the mobile applications are very dependent on the application service and API used to retrieve data in the database and to display information that is displayed in mobile applications. The goal is to discover the preparation that needs to be done by the developer so that the transfer of technology to micro services still gives the user a comfortable feeling without any interference.

This development triggers the appearance of change of an old system with a newly created system. One development that is trending is microcontroller technology which can now be used in all aspects of the environment. This development will create an automatic lamp prototype that can save electricity in a room, thereby reducing the waste of electricity usage from State Electricity Company (PLN). This prototype approach uses a human movement detection sensor with a Passive Infra-Red (PIR) sensor which is then integrated with the Arduino Uno microcontroller as the control center of the sensor. In addition to the PIR sensor, there is also a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensor or also commonly called a light sensor that functions as a determinant of the light intensity needed in the room, so that the use of controlled lights is in accordance with the intensity of the room's light. In addition, there is a GSM Sim 900A which is used as a notification in the event of a use of electricity outside the sensor controller. © 2020 IEEE.","Light dependent resistor (LDR); Microcontroller; On-off lamp; Passive infra-red (PIR)","Controllers; Electric power generation; Information management; Control center; Electricity companies; Electricity usage; Human movements; Light dependent resistor; Light intensity; Microcontroller technology; Science and Technology; Microcontrollers",,,,,,"Kadir, A., (2018) Dasar Pemrograman Internet Untuk Proyek Berbasis Arduino, , Yogyakarta: Penerbit Andi; Kadir, A., (2018) From Zero to A Pro Arduino, , Yogyakarta: Penerbit Andi; Isfarizky, Z., Mufti, A., Rancang bangun sistem kontrol pemakaian listrik secara multi channel berbasis arduino (studi kasus kantor lbh banda aceh) (2017) Kitektro J.

Many researchers have conducted studies on the use of recommendation systems in online learning. However, until now, several similar studies still focus on the accuracy of the prediction results. Various obstacles were encountered related to changes in the face to face learning process into online learning. This study uses the User-Item Collaborative Filtering method to predict student learning outcomes as a basis for providing recommendations to students. Data on student online learning outcomes were extracted using several methods as a basis for determining and assessing their learning outcomes. The dataset we use is dummy to match the original data. The findings of this study reveal that one of the reinforcing factors that affect student achievement in online learning is the quiz score. The students' high achievement in the quizzes was also balanced by their active involvement during the learning process. Based on the evaluation of the recommendation system, it is known that the gradient boosted tree model is the best model for predicting the final score of student online learning with an accuracy calculated using the highest correlation of 0.7 and the smallest absolute error of 13.0 and root mean square error of 17.9. Based on the results of the evaluation, this study provides recommendations in the form of material links and learning archives that are useful for students to be able to carry out independent learning. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Discussion forums, also referred to as a means to discuss all learning materials and conference systems, are also a means to discuss the material as a substitute for face-to-face meetings between students and lecturers. This phenomenon is also found in online learning. Unfortunately, online learning is not supported by 24-hour real-time lecturer responses. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify, analyze needs, and design Chatbots that can be used as role models to develop LMS as an intelligent academic information system, especially to support 24 hours of interactive learning processes in all subjects. This study uses the Natural Language Processing approach to generate responses such as daily conversations. The analysis is done and used to design chatbots that can maximize LMS work that is smart and can help student learning activities, especially around the most frequently asked questions. After being tested on several subjects in the Information System Engineering group, it is known that Chatbot can interact with students like having daily conversations. In the future, the results of this study are used as supporting systems for recommendations on smart LMS. © 2019 IEEE.","Chatbot; Massive Online Open Courses; Natural Language Processing; Smart LMS","E-learning; Information systems; Information use; Natural language processing systems; Students; Chatbot; Face-to-face meetings; Frequently asked questions; Interactive learning; Massive Online Open Courses; NAtural language processing; Smart LMS; Supporting systems; Learning systems",,,,,,"Serban, I.V., Sankar, C., Germain, M., Zhang, S., Lin, Z., Subramanian, S., Rajeshwar, S., (2017) A Deep Reinforcement Learning Chatbot, , arXiv preprint arXiv, 1709.02349; Hone, K.S., El Said, G.R., Exploring the factors affecting MOOC retention: A survey study (2016) Computers & Education, 98, pp. 157-168; Lalwani, T., Bhalotia, S., Pal, A., Bisen, S., Rathod, V., (2018) Implementation of a Chat Bot System Using AI and NLP; Weizenbaum, J., ELIZA-a computer program for the study of natural language communication between man and machine (1966) Communications of the ACM, 9 (1), pp. 36-45; Radziwill, N.M., Benton, M.C., (2017) Evaluating Quality of Chatbots and Intelligent Conversational Agents, , arXiv preprint arXiv, 1704.04579; Shawar, B.A., Atwell, E., Chatbots: Are they really useful?

It aims to find algorithms that excel in performance. The performance, which is a measure is the time and memory used to encrypt and decrypt with the same key-the method used in research with an experimental approach. Where experimental done on Raspberry PI with PHP programming language, the results of this study indicate that the AES algorithm requires a shorter time in encrypting messages compared to the DES algorithm. The AES algorithm uses a larger memory capacity in encrypting messages compared to the DES algorithm. The AES algorithm is recommended to use because in terms of security AES has a more significant number of keys that is 128 bits while the DES algorithm has a key length of 64 bits or half of the number of keys in the AES Algorithm. The results of the comparison of the two algorithms can be used as a reference where two encryption algorithms are compatible with the applications and devices developed. © 2019 IEEE.","AES; DES; Performance Comparison; Raspberry PI; Symmetries Encryption Algorithm","Engineering; AES algorithms; DES algorithms; Encryption algorithms; Experimental approaches; Key lengths; Memory capacity; Performance comparison; Cryptography",,,,,,"Chaitanaya, G., Keerthi, B., Saleem, A., Rao, A.T., Kumar, K.T.P.S., An image encryption and decryption using chaos algorithm (2015) IOSR J.

The face is a biometric feature with the intrinsic nature of a human. So that the face has self-stability, deep individual differences and can be an ideal basis for verification of an identity. In this research use, Deep Learning Network method uses to perform detection or face recognition. In this study, we present a framework that can be used to detect faces. This research is also able to present a DNN model that is used to study data sources from the data stream in sequence. The most important part of this study is able to adjust the capacity of the model from the simple one. This research uses experimental design method. The first step is a collection of face image data. Then the architecture design starts from the determination of the depth of the network, layout layers, and the selection of layer types that will be used to get the model based on input dataset and label name index. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Deep neural networks; Network layers; Neural networks; Architecture designs; Biometric features; Convolutional neural network; Experimental design method; Face recognition systems; Individual Differences; Intrinsic nature; Learning network; Face recognition",,,,,,"Howard, W.R., (2008) Biometric System and Data Analysis: Design, Evaluation, and Data Mining, 38, p. 1637. , (New York, NY: Springer 2008) Biometric System and Data Analysis: Design, Evaluation, and Data Mining20092Ted Dunstone and Neil Yager 268 pp.,978-0-387-77625-5 (contact www.springer.com for current price),quot; Kybernetes Oct. 2009; Siagian, P., Fernando, E., Authentication Login E-Library with Multimodal Biometrics System in (2014) International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics, pp. 20-21. , 2014 August; Charifa, M.S., Suliman, Bikdash, M., Face Recognition Using a Hybrid General Backpropagation Neural Network (2007) IEEE Int.

With the vastness of the area, Indonesia has so many and scattered tourist attractions. Indonesia is also a target of tourism by local and foreign tourists. Problems that occur are many tourist attractions that can not be known by tourists so that they experience a severe problem in getting information related to the culinary. One of the problems of information about its existence, which is spread in several locations and knowledge about the area that is not good, especially for tourists from outside the city. Of course, if this is ignored continuously will have a negative impact on culinary tourism, such as the lonely tourists who come to visit in the country of Indonesia. This study provides a solution that is seen from the existing problems; it is necessary to answer the need for fast and more efficient information about culinary attractions in Indonesia, namely by developing an Android-based GIS-based application that provides an easy search for information and culinary tourism locations. User required. Software development uses the waterfall method and tests on users with questionnaires to users. The results of this study, culinary tourism mobile applications that are based on the results of tests carried out obtain a percentage score of 81-100, which can be interpreted that this application is very feasible to use and apply to provide culinary information. © 2019 IEEE","Android; Culinary Tour; Geographic Information System; Mobile","Android (operating system); Information systems; Information use; Software design; Software testing; Surveys; Android; Culinary Tour; Existing problems; Gis-based; Mobile; Mobile applications; Tourist attractions; Waterfall methods; Geographic information systems",,,,,,"Fernando, E., Touriano, D., Murad, D.F., Bimo, A.C., Pemetaan dan analisa sebaran tempat public pada kecamatan jambi Timur di kota jambi dengan sistem informasi Geografis (2018) J.

The SLR method analyzed papers published in the range of 2013-2018. Out of the 109 papers this study analyzed indepth 42 papers. The study findings confirmed that most of RS studies still focused on e-commerce, movies, tourists, and more whose most popular RS methods were collaborative filtering and content base. Some studies in RS for online education were mostly focused on scheduling, recommendations for courses, books, prospective students and others. The results of this study found that there are still much opportunities to develop methods and approaches for RS in online learning. This study findings gives foundation of our future research to develop a model of conscious contextual recommendation system using Machine Learning based on smart LMS for online learning. © 2018 IEEE.","distance learning; machine learning; online learning; Recommender System; smart LMS","Collaborative filtering; Distance education; Education computing; Electronic commerce; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Online systems; Recommender systems; Contextual recommendations; Learning management system; Literature reviews; NAtural language processing; On-line education; Online learning; smart LMS; Systematic literature review (SLR); E-learning",,,,,,"Mothukuri, U.K., Improvisation of learning experience using Learning Analytics in eLearning, 2017; Za, O.R., (2002) Building a Recommender Agent for e-Learning Systems; Kong, X., Boll, S., Heuten, W., (2013) Towards Recommender Systems Supporting Knowledge Sharing and Transfer in Vocational Education and Training, pp. 25-30; Kumar, A., Open Problems in Recommender Systems Diversity, 2017, pp. 82-87; Salman, Y., Abu-Issa, A., Tumar, I., Hassouneh, Y., A model and prototype of a proactive multi-Type context-Aware recommender system 2017 Intell.

One of the biological factors from water quality is the life of macro benthos organisms. In some existing studies macro benthos is usually used as a bioindicator of water quality. The presence of a specific macro benthos family or macro benthos organism that has similarities in the aquatic environment signifies the water quality level. Such extreme environmental changes provide a macro benthos life tolerance value called the Biotic Factor Index (BFI). The purpose of this publication is Knowing the relationship between the biotic index and water quality, SQL syntax to calculate the Biotic Index from the input of each sampling point, the design of the system that accommodates each macro benthos findings from each sampling point in a water. The biotic value from spring to autumn is 2.59, 2.68, 3.22, 3.42, all of them is in very good water quality. © 2018 IEEE.","biotic family index; design system analyze; macro benthos; water quality","Aquatic ecosystems; Aquatic organisms; Information management; Water quality; Aquatic environments; Biological factors; biotic family index; Design systems; Environmental change; Household activities; Macro benthos; Production activity; Potable water",,,,,,"Mandaville, S.M., Benthic macroinvertebrates in freshwaters-Taxa tolerance values, metrics, and protocols (2002) Soil Water Conserv.

The level of similarity then we validated using a lecture note. This research is a continuation of the research that we are currently doing related to the development of smart LMS with one of the supporting features of the recommendation system. Using the analysis in the forum log post discussion of this research was carried out through several stages. The first stage, the random selection of 5 classes taken by the forum data, the second stage, carried out text mining analysis from the posts of students and lecturers, the third stage, analyzing text validation using lecture notes that have been used as data sets in the form of corpus. This study uses the doc2v algorithm with vectorization. The results of this study found that the percentage of similarities between lecturers' posts, students and lecture notes only reached 49% of the target we expected at least 80%. Because discussion forums are a substitute for face-to-face sessions on face-to-face learning. On the other hands this study found that the similarity of discussion between lecturers and students on discussion forums had a significant influence on student learning outcomes (assignment) and this reinforces the need for a system of recommendations for online learning. © 2018 IEEE.","Log forum discuss; Online learning; Recommendation system; Smart LMS; Text mining analysis","Data mining; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Online systems; Recommender systems; Students; Degree of similarity; Face-to-face learning; Log forum discuss; Online learning; Random selection; Smart LMS; Student learning outcomes; Text mining analysis; E-learning",,,,,,"Wan, S., Niu, Z., An e-learning recommendation approach based on the self-organization of learning resource (2018) Knowledge-Based Systems, 160, pp. 71-87; Pawar, A., Mago, V., (2018) Calculating the Similarity between Words and Sentences Using a Lexical Database and Corpus Statistics, , arXiv preprint; Medeiros, E.A.S., De Menezes, F.G., Guerra, C.M., Batista, R.E.A., Perdiz, L.B., Angelieri, D.B., E-learning practices on healthcare associated infections (hai): Report of brazilian experience (2008) Am J Infect Dis, 4 (4), pp. 232-236; Jabr, M.A., Al-Omari, H.K., E-learning management system using service oriented architecture (2010) J Comput Sci, 6 (3), pp. 285-295; Hirzallah, N., An authoring tool for as-in-class e-lectures in e-learning systems (2007) Am J Appl Sci, 4 (9), pp. 686-692; Limongelli, C., Lombardi, M., Marani, A., Sciarrone, F., Temperini, M., A recommendation module to help teachers build courses through the moodle learning management system (2016) New Rev Hypermedia Multimed; Alfalah, T.F., Alfalah, S.F., Falah, J.F., Qutaishat, W., Ishretih, W., Al-Zu'bi, M., Learning management system versus social networking sites (2017) Int Bus Res; Naveh, G., Shelef, A., Let the learning management system grow on you-the effect of experience on satisfaction (2018) Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing; Phongphaew, N., Jiamsanguanwong, A., Usability evaluation on learning management system (2018) Adv Intell Syst Comput; Wiley, D.A., The instructional use of learning objects(1) (2002) Bloomington, In: Agency for Instructional Technology; Tohti, T., Zhao, Y., Musajan, W., (2017) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1 (887), pp. 1-7. , Word2vec and Dictionary Based Approach for Uyghur Text Filtering; Hearst, M.A., Text data mining: Issues, techniques, and the relationship to information access (1997) Presentation Notes for Uw/Ms Workshop on Data Mining, , July 1997; Feldman, R., Dagan, I., Knowledge discovery in textual databases (kdt (1995) Proceedings of the First International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (kdd-95), pp. 112-117. , Montreal, Canada, August 20-21, aaai Press; Fayyad, U., Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Smyth, P., From data mining to knowledge discovery: An overview (1996) Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1-36. , U.

Jakarta is one of the big cities and is the capital of Indonesia. This study aims to provide solutions to congestion problems in the capital city by maximizing the intelligent transportation system, convenient and safe for passengers. This research finds the fact that people's need for Trans Jakarta is relatively high but in fact it is not directly proportional to the public interest towards the use of Trans Jakarta buses. This study finds issues related to the needs and expectations of the community using Trans Jakarta facilities. Not only convenience and security and cheap price offered but also the ease and speed in transacting. This research provides ideas related to the facilities provided by Trans Jakarta as one of public transportation owned by the government. Combining smart phones with the use of internet-based technology (IOT). This research proposed an integrated system (integration platform). The solution with IOT-based technology enhancements makes it easy to present all information about bus availability, bus scheduling, booking places and easy online payment.

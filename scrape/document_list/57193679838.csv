As one of the oldest cultures in the world, Chinese culture—which consists of literary arts, architecture, and craft—has diverse philosophical interpretations. A Chinese restaurant, as a place to serve traditional Chinese food in public space, visibly holds a strong connection to Chinese culture. Moreover, art can become an attractive method to deliver aesthetic contents of Chinese philosophy, especially its symbolic interpretation. In a typical Chinese restaurant, the connection between art and tradition is represented through the aesthetic elements that act functionally with their specific and unique characteristics. Therefore, these characteristics can be observed and studied in order to enhance further knowledge about Chinese culture. Furthermore, the theoretical aspects of culture and aesthetic design can also expand the perspective of our contemporary society and relate their understanding about tradition and ethnicity, especially Chinese culture in Indonesia and other countries. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Aesthetic; Chinese culture; Informal education; Interpretation; Philosophy",,,,,,"(2007) Jurnal Historisme, p. 24; , p. 1. , https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/Chinese_symbols_1109.pdf, A British Museum Tour: Journey to the East, The British Museum Partnership, UK (2008-09); (2016) Vocabulary.Com, , https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/restaurant; Velamuriramakrishna, S., Modern thinking turns traditional food into $400 million business—case study: South Beauty Group The Korea Times, , http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2015/09/332_82990.html; http://www.britannica.com/topic/long; , p. 3. , https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/Chinese_symbols_1109.pdf, A British Museum Tour: Journey to the East, The British Museum Partnership, UK (2008-09), Web.

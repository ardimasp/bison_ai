The number of online websites that provide services for the hospitality industry is on the rise. Previous studies have focused more on luxury hotels and there is a lack of study to show the perception of guests regarding budget hotels' websites. Therefore the objective of this study is to analyze the connection between a website quality (usability and ease of use) towards online booking with the e-Trust variable on ZEN Rooms. Data were collected through self-administered questionnaires that were distributed using social media and mobile chatting application. The collected data was analyzed with the Multiple Linear Regression method and some descriptive analysis. The findings of the research state that the ease of use variable has a significant impact on online booking intention, same as the e-Trust variable. The result also showed e-Trust could highly be explained by the ease of use of the website and also the usability of a website. Result also depicted there was no significant difference between genders in terms of e-Trust in using websites. A major contribution of this study is its implications for practitioners in the hospitality industry for developing marketing strategies. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Budget hotel; E-Trust; Online booking; Website quality; ZEN Rooms",,,,,,"The authors wish to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika journal team that help publish this article.","(2015) Alasan mengapa berbelanja di situs e-commerce lebih hemat [The reason why shopping on e-commerce sites is more efficient], , https://news.detik.com/adv-nhl-detikcom/d-3057321/alasan-mengapa-berbelanja-di-situs-ecommerce-lebih-hemat, Advertorial.

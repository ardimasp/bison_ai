The distribution of the workload in a production process needs to be calculated so that the company is able to achieve the target of production. This research was conducted to improve the efficiency of production systems and the production capacity of the company so that the company is able to meet production targets. The method used in this study is line balancing. Time study method is conducted to calculate cycle time and then forecasting method is utilized to determine production target and required cycle time. After that, 3 methods of line balancing: ranked positional weights, Moodie Young and new bidirectional is used. The result of the line balancing method shows that the best methods are Moodie Young and new bidirectional with the efficiency of 82.97%, much higher from the current state, which is only 48.89%. The number of workstation is also decreased from 9 to 7. The production also increased from 780.41 pieces per day to 1,030.07 pieces per day. © 2016 IEEE.","line balancing; Moodie & Young; New Bidirectional method; plastic manufacturing; ranked positional weight","Assembly; Efficiency; Manufacture; Forecasting methods; Line balancing; Manufacturing companies; New Bidirectional method; Production capacity; Production process; Production targets; Ranked positional weights; Industrial research",,,,,"Heizer, J., Render, B., (2011) Operations Management., , New Jersey: Prentice Hall; Kumar, N., Mahto, D., Assembly line balancing: A review of developments and trends in approach to industrial application (2013) Global Journal of Researches (G), 13 (2), pp. 29-50; Güner, M., Yücel, Ö., Ünal, C., Applicability of different line balancing methods in the production of apparel (2013) Tekstil Ve Konfeksiyon, 23 (1), pp. 77-84; Wignjosoebroto, S., (2008) Ergonomi Studi Gerak Dan Waktu, , Surabaya: Guna Widya; Apriyono, A., Taman, A., Analisis overreaction pada saham perusahaan manufaktur di bursa efek Indonesia (bei) periode 2005-2009 (2013) Jurnal Nomina, 2 (2); Pachghare, V.V., Dalu, R.S., Assembly line balancing methods - A case study (2014) International Journal of Science and Research, 3 (5). , May; Gozali, L., Widodo, L., Bernhard, M., Analisa keseimbangan lini pada departemen chassis pt toyota motor manufacturing Indonesia dengan algoritma ant colony, rank positional weight, dan algoritma genetika (2012) Jurnal Teknik Industri, 2 (2), pp. 119-126. , July; Kusuma, H., (2009) Manajemen Produksi, , Yogyakarta: ANDI; Natalia, L., Sinulingga, S., Siregar, I., Penyeimbangan lintasan pada perakitan transformator dengan metode moodie young dan comsoal pada PT.

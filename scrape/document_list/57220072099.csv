It provides a comprehensive completion approach and gives total confidence to asset owner to operate the facility handed over by construction contractors. While the nature variation of asset hierarchy is unique from one type of asset to another, a project completion software must have prominent ability to adapt wide range of variations with unlimited level of hierarchy. One of the approaches to overcome this is implementing a tree-model concept to accommodate flexible hierarchy. Unfortunately, the package is loaded with complexity to retrieve data and takes longer join operation. This paper proposes a business intelligence approach to analyze and make an optimum reporting retrieval using data warehouse. This is implemented in 4 steps following Kimball methods. The objective of this paper is to generate model by using data warehouse starting the extract, transform and load process on the flexible tree model hierarchy. It can be used to generate report and comprehensive dashboard especially progress report of project and work schedule as needed in the oil and gas and construction industry. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

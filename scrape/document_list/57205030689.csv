The research method used begins with a literature study and survey, which aims to identify the company's vision, mission, objectives and identify the IT resources used by the company today. It then identifies the company's business objectives, objectives and Division strategies, and ongoing processes in the division. The results obtained a gap between the current maturity level with the maturity level that has not reached the company's expectations. The conclusion obtained that the data governance at PT. XYZ can still be improved. The improvement is taken from DAMA DMBOK as best practice on data governance, by identifying which area that the company did not have. © 2018 IEEE.","DAMA DMBOK; data governance; data management; stanford maturity assessment","Business objectives; DAMA DMBOK; Data governances; Literature studies; Management division; Maturity assessments; Maturity levels; research methods; Information management",,,,,"Techtarget.com (2009) The Importance of Managing Data Assets, , http://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/feature/Theimportance-of-managing-data-Assets; Peters, T., Robert, H.W., Jr., (2001) Search of Excellence, HarperCollins Publishers Inc; Mosley, M., Brackett, M., Earley, S., Henderson, D., The DAMA Guide to the Data Management Body of Knowledge (2011) Technics Publications, LLC Post; Otto, B., (2011) A Morphology of the Organisation of Data Governance.

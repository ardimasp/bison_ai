This research examines gamification in Shoppee, one of the biggest e-commerce sites in Indonesia. Based on survey data, this study examines the effect of gamification on different generations (generation X versus Millennials). The study uses a quantitative approach using SEM (Structure Equation Model) with Smart PLS to analyze the data. The result shows that there is a significantly different effect on both generations. Generation X show that perceived usefulness and recognition are an essential aspect of gamification. While for millennials, they show that playfulness and social influence are important factors. © 2020 IEEE.","E-commerce; Gamification; Generation","Electronic commerce; Information management; Different effects; E-commerce sites; Game elements; Perceived usefulness; Quantitative approach; Social influence; Structure equation models; Survey data; Gamification",,,,,"Koivisto, J., Hamari, J., The rise of motivational information systems: A review of gamification research (2019) Int.

It then examines the technology to construct natural disaster management, consisting of preparation, mitigation, response and recovery for disaster recovery.

This study discusses the factors that influence for increasing satisfaction of public transportation passengers, in this case, train passengers. In addition to factors that were discussed in previous studies, this paper also added digital service factors. This study conducted online survey and data analyzing using PLS-SEM method. Service delivery, onboard experience and accessibility are the most important factors in ensuring passenger satisfaction. Although digital service has not been a significant determinant in passenger satisfaction, this paper also proposes issues that need attention in relation to IT governance. © 2019 IEEE.","IT Governance; Public transportation; Smart mobility","Scanning electron microscopy; Digital services; IT governance; Online surveys; Passenger satisfaction; Public transportation; Service delivery; Sustainable cities; Urban growth",,,,,"Firmansyah, H.S., Supangkat, S.H., Arman, A.A., Giabbanelli, P.J., Identifying the components and interrelationships of smart cities in Indonesia: Supporting policymaking via fuzzy cognitive systems (2019) Ieee Access, 7, pp. 46136-46151; Perk, J.V., Flynn, V.J., Transit ridership, reliability, and retention (2008) State Florida Dep.

Using Mobile technology and its application, students can acquire knowledge and learn new skills. Mobile technology offers a different set of rules to learn and change how students can learn. Nevertheless, there also a challenge to utilize mobile learning. Some factor has implication for the effectiveness of learning using mobile learning. This paper will evaluate the readiness factor towards students' intention for using mobile learning. There are self-efficacy, computer playfulness, subjective Norm, perceived enjoyment and Content quality. The survey was conducted with respondents from high school students. PLS-SEM was used to analyze those factors. The result show that self-efficacy and perceived enjoyment are significant factor for readiness students to use mobile learning. © 2019 IEEE.","mobile learning; readiness; students","E-learning; Information management; Surveys; Telecommunication equipment; Content qualities; High school students; Learning Activity; Mobile Learning; Mobile Technology; Perceived enjoyment; readiness; Readiness factors; Students",,,,,"Kane, L., Meet Generation Z, the millenials on steroids who could lead the charge for change in the US (2017) Business Insider, , http://www.businessinsider.sg/generation-zprofile-2017-9/?r=US&IR=T, [Accessed: 12-Apr-2017]; Naismith, L., Sharples, M., Vavoula, G., Lonsdale, P., (2004) Literature Review in Mobile Technologies and Learning; Davis, F.D., A technology acceptance model for empirically testing new end-user information systems: Theory and results (1985) Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Venkatesh, V., Davis, F.D., A theoretical extension of the technology acceptance model: Four longitudinal field studies (2000) Manage.

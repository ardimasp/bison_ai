Analysis methods composed from two methods, which is current system analysis and recommended system planning. Current system data collection method included direct survey to school, interview, and research from literature. System design and recommendation method based on OOAD (Object Oriented Analysis and Design). We created the model of information system to provide solution and guideline to school when they want to develop management information system. Summary of this research is provided model of analysis and design to leverage school whom need the application to support the efficiency and effectivity of learning, teaching, and administration purposes. © IAEME Publication.","Analysis; Design; Information System; Learning; School",,,,,,"Brumbulli, M., Topçiu, B., Dalaçi, A., (2008) SMIS: A Web-Based School Management; Nikhil, S., (2014) The Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom Hierarchy and Its Antithesis, , https://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/viewFile/12806/11288, September 4.

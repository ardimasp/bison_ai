A great amount of researches aimed to realize a tracking system that works inside a building. However, only few researches uses BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). In a tracking system using BLE, its position strongly determines the accuracy of the position of the object. Therefore, the goal of this research was to develop a positioning system using Bluetooth generation 4 and Bluetooth Low Energy based on the distance measurement. In this research, the trilateration technique applied at 4 models position was analyzed: AOTG (All on the Ground), UBS (Upper Beacon and Smartphone), UBLS (Upper Beacon Lower Smartphone) and LBUS (Lower Beacon Upper Smartphone). The experiment provided in this paper indicated that the best result achieved from the four models is shown by AOTG models with the direct line of sight between a beacon and a smartphone, which was fulfilled. The average error generated is 0.771meter. The second best result has been given by LBUS that has an average error of 0.841 meter. The third best result has been given by UBS that has an average error of 1.061 meter and the worst one has been given by UBLS that has an average error of 1.217 meter. © 2018 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.

This means that there is already a preference for Internet users in terms of using devices from PC and laptop computers to mobile devices. With the development of technology and the transition to mobile, the education sector is also experiencing a change from face-to-face in the classroom (conventional) to online learning. The researcher proposes a prototype of a mobile-based online learning management system (m-LMS) that will be used and adopted by students and lecturers at the nursing academy. The study aims to determine the preferences of prospective nurses in using smartphone devices as m-learning media and specific needs in m-learning learning situations, as well as their opinions on the appropriateness of learning through smartphones. Retrieval of data using interview techniques to students and lecturers at the nursing academy. The sampling technique of this study used simple random sampling. The results obtained were enthusiastic nursing students with online learning via smartphones and the feature most wanted by students was the availability of learning material that could be downloaded and read whenever they needed. The research resulted in the design of a mobile-based learning development model for nursing school students and lecturers. © 2019 IEEE.","education; learning management systems; mobile learning; nursing; online learning","E-learning; Education computing; Engineering education; Laptop computers; Learning systems; Nursing; Smartphones; Development model; Education sectors; Learning materials; Learning situation; Nursing education; Nursing students; Sampling technique; Simple random sampling; Students",,,,"039/VR, RTT/IV/2019","This work was supported by the Ministry of Research Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia (Kementerian Riset, Teknologi, dan Pendidikan Tinggi Republik Indonesia) under Grant No 039/VR.RTT/IV/2019","Al-Hudhud, G., Aspect oriented design for team learning management system (2015) Computers in Human Behavior.

This machine log contains a variety of information about the printed product produced. By analyzing the login, it is expected to find patterns that can be used to find out customer needs. Case-based Reasoning is a knowledge transformation technique used in the context of a new algorithm. The way to find out the case-based reason is to use data mining techniques. One technique is the C4.5 method, called the tree data mining method which is often used in classifying and making rules based on transactional data or facts. The purpose of this study is to determine the rules or segmentation of customers. So that in the future the rules generated from this context can be used in system development. © 2018 IEEE.","C4.5; Consumen Segmentation; Data mining Case base Reasoning","Data mining; Intelligent systems; Trees (mathematics); C4.5; Case-base reasonings; Case-based reasoning approaches; Knowledge transformation; Printed products; Printing machines; System development; Transactional data; Case based reasoning",,,,,,"Hendriani, L., (2007) Inovasi Program Promosi Untuk Sales, , Jakarta: AcNielsen; Padmanaban, B., Segmenting customer transactions using a pattern-based clustering approach Int.

An evaluation of blended learning implementation in a university is performed by measuring the satisfaction level of the students in the face-to-face sessions, the independent learning session using online learning, and the overall learning experience with the blended learning environment. Several components have been measured: the content of the online learning, the features, and ease of use of the learning management platform, as well as the interactivity between the students and the lecturer and among the students.

One form is e-learning. In its development, e-learning has several problems when faced with the background and needs of students who take part in learning. These differences affect the effectiveness of learning because not all students have the same learning style. To over-come these problems, researchers tried to use fuzzy logic methods. Fuzzy logic is chosen to answer the uncertainty that occurs in learning subjective student characters. Therefore, the study was conducted on one e-learning website called sasmoko.com. The e-learning website is a research method course where students from various backgrounds and needs are used. In this study a model was proposed in as-sessing student characters on the sasmoko.com website. © 2018 Authors.","Artificial intelligent; E-learning; Fuzzy logic",,,,,"Binus University","The research was funded by Bina Nusantara University with a Binus Grant fund for the period of 2018.

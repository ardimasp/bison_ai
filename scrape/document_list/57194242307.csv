Similarly, the city in Indonesia. This is reflected in the many children who play in places that were not proper playground. Most children play in places that are not supposed to eg: roads, sidewalk, railway. Children choice to play in places that are not supposed, is the last option for children, this is the impact of the policy which often ignores the availability of playgrounds that are friendly for children. This research carried out in Tangerang, as one protester city of Jakarta by using qualitative research methods. The reason of children playing on the street : Internal factors, physical condition of open space; External factors, reluctance of children to play in open space because of the competition between the users of children by adults; phisical accesibility, easily accessible, since the users are children, the safety factor in reaching the playground is an important factor; visual accesibility can be reached easily by their parents or can be monitored by parents. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","behavior; children; play; street","Roads and streets; Accesibility; behavior; children; External factors; Internal factors; Physical conditions; play; Qualitative research methods; Safety factor",,,,,"Ekawati, S.A., Children - Friendly Streets as Urban Playgrounds (2015) Procedia - Social and Behavioral Science Sciences, 179, pp. 94-108; Zara, N., (2002) Akomodasi Kebutuhan Ruang Anak Pada Perumahan Formal; Kusumo, W.S., (2010) Perubahan Pemanfaatan Ruang Bermain Anak di Perumahan Griya Dukuh Asri Salatiga; Hurlock, E.B., (1978) Child Growth and Development; Sylva, K., (1982) Child Development: A First Course; Miller, P.H., (1989) Theories of Development Psychology 2nd Edn; Smith-Sutton, B., (1997) Children's Play; Jenkinson, S., (2001) The Genius of Play: Celebrating the Spirit of Childhood; Burhan, M., (1999) Kondisi Lingkungan Bermain di Kota-kota Besar di Indonesia Sebagai Dampak Proses Urbanisasi; Lee, C., (1990) The Growth and Development of Children (4th Editition); Jordan, T.M., Abu-Ghazzeh, Children's Use of the Street As a Playground in Abu-Nuseir (1998) Environment and Behavior, 30 (6), pp. 799-831; Lia, K., Van Vliet Willem, Children in the City: Reclaiming the Street (2006) Children, Youth and Environments, 16, pp. 151-167; James Susanna Millar, S., (1968) The Psychology of Play; Freud, S., (2003) Beyond the Pleasure Principle; Wilkinson, P.F., (1980) Inovation in Play Environments; Bobby Saragih, J.F., Limitedness of Space in Coastal Settlement Area; How Children Create Their Playground IOP Conference Series Earth and Environmental Science, 195; Djuwita, R., Feriyanto, C., (1987) Perbandingan Pola Bermain Anak di Rumah Susun Dan Rumah Datar; Hurlock, E.B., (1978) Child Growth and Development; Purwadarminta, W.J.S., (1939) Baoesastra Djawa; Hughes Fergus, P., (2010) Play and Development; Bobby Saragih, J.F., Tedja, M., How children create their space for play?

One of the historical and cultural tourist destination which has great potential is Pasar Gedhe Hardjonegaro central market, which is a cultural heritage building. The development of the central market as a tourist destination is expected to improve this valuable place as one of the cultural and historical tourism destination. This paper aims to formulate the strategies to develop the Pasar Gedhe central market as the tourist destination towards sustainable tourism. For this purpose, a literature review was carried out to understand several terms and definitions, respect to sustainable tourism. This paper explores and discusses the aspects for developing a central market as a tourist destination and identifies the aspects for sustainable tourism by interpreting tourism in the context of sustainable development. The strategies are found by improving the local and cultural value, and the qualities and characteristics of place. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","central market; model development; sustainable tourism","Commerce; Sustainable development; Cultural heritages; Cultural value; Literature reviews; Model development; Sustainable tourism; Tourist destinations; Tourism",,,,,"Bapppeda.surakarta. go. id; Aliyah, I., Setioko, B., Pradoto, W., Spatial flexibility in cultural mapping of traditional market area in Surakarta: A case study of Pasar Gede in Surakarta (2017) City, Culture and Society, 10, pp. 41-51; Giantari, I., Surya, I., Yasa, N., Yasa, I., Development and revitalization strategies for traditional markets in Bali (2018) Intl.

It means buildings have to reduce the energy consumption of fossil fuel and take action to use clean energy such as wind energy. The higher altitude, the higher wind speed. Wind speed as a function of altitude has a chance to be used in highrise buildings. Indonesia is a humid tropical country, which generally has the character of relatively low wind speeds. In another hand, high-rise buildings have considerable potential value to utilize height as a factor to obtain sufficient wind speed. This study aims to identify the potential for wind energy in high-rise buildings in humid tropical climate. Problems focused on the design arrangement of wind turbine type on the building and the potential energy can be harnessed. This research was conducted in suburban areas where the roughness level is lower than the city centre. This study focused on assessing the potential of the wind on tall buildings in a built environment in suburban areas. The research method is quantitative research which the variable is observed from wind speed data. Research developed by the experimental research method with CFD simulation to meet the built environment wind profile for further analysis. The variable data is observed from field measurement and local wind speed data. Case study takes on campus Bina Nusantara Alam Sutera as a case of the building which represents a type of highrise buildings in suburban Jakarta area. This study shows at least five types of possible arrangements which can be applied to buildings. This study presents the alternative use of wind energy utilization at Bina Nusantara University as a cross-subsidy scheme. Wind energy can replace 3.27 % of main building energy consumption equal with CO2 emission reductions as 127,650 kgCO2.

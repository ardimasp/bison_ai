However, many young adults suffer poor sleep due to work or academic demands. Even more, sleep is associated with stress which is many young adults experienced it. To solve this problem, many epidemiologic studies suggest that exercise may improve sleep quality. On the other hand, several studies show that daily activity has no association with sleep quality. In this study, we tried to find more evidence of whether the daily activity has an association with sleep quality or not. We used a commercially available wearable device to capture the subject's heart rate, step count and deep sleep duration for 7 months. Then we used linear regression, XGBoost, and Long Short-Term Memory to find an association between these variables. The results show that there was no association between these variables. © 2020 IEEE.","Heart rate; Physical activity; Sleep quality; Step count; Wearable device","Information management; Wearable technology; Daily activity; Epidemiologic-study; Heart rates; Mental health; Sleep quality; Wearable devices; Young adults; Sleep research",,,,,,,"Watson, N.F., Recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult: A joint consensus statement of the American academy of sleep medicine and sleep research society (2015) Sleep; Engle-Friedman, M., The effect of sleep loss on next day effort (2003) J.

Hence, researchers have begun to put significant efforts into studying the direct and indirect benefits of wearable devices for health and wellbeing. This paper summarizes recent studies on the use of consumer wearable devices to improve physical activity, mental health, and health consciousness. Methods: A thorough literature search was performed from several reputable data-bases, such as PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, arXiv, and bioRxiv mainly using “wearable device research” as a keyword, no earlier than 2018. As a result, 25 of the most recent and relevant papers included in this review cover several topics, such as previous literature reviews (9 papers), wearable device accuracy (3 papers), self-reported data collection tools (3 papers), and wearable device intervention (10 papers). Results: All the chosen studies are discussed based on the wearable device used, complementary data, study design, and data processing method. All these previous studies indicate that wearable devices are used either to validate their benefits for general wellbeing or for more serious medical contexts, such as cardiovascular dis-orders and post-stroke treatment. Conclusions: Despite their huge potential for adoption in clinical settings, wearable device accuracy and validity remain the key challenge to be met. Some lessons learned and future projections, such as combining traditional study design with statistical and machine learning methods, are highlighted in this paper to provide a useful over-view for other researchers carrying out similar research. © 2020 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.","Exercise; Fitness Tracker; Medical Informatics; Mental Health; Wearable Electronic Device",,,,,"Kementerian Riset Teknologi Dan Pendidikan Tinggi Republik Indonesia","This study is funded by Directorate of Research and Community Service, Directorate General of Research and Development, Indonesian Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education as a part of 2019 Applied Excellent Research in Higher Education Grant.",,"(2019) IDC Reports Strong Growth in the Worldwide Wearables Market, Led by Holiday Shipments of Smart-Watches, Wrist Bands, and Ear-Worn Devices, , https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS44901819, Framingham (MA): IDC Corporate; [cited at 2020 Apr 15].

Because this fish is known to have higher albumin fraction (64.61%) of protein and other economic values, domestication, and cultivation of this fish has been done in many Asian countries such as Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, and India. Environmental factors such as temperature, water pH, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, and turbidity are important parameters must be considered inbreeding and growing this type of fish. The aim of this paper is to propose an IoT solution to automatically monitor these environmental factors. It is designed with affordable and open-source electrical components to provide a cost-efficient solution for farmers. Five sensors are used to measure each parameter. A web application prototype is also presented as a companion application for the users to get useful information from the IoT device. It is developed using a Pythonframework. By accessing this web application, the users can immediately detect any abnormal conditions of the pond. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cultivation; Dissolved oxygen; Fish; Lakes; Abnormal conditions; Asian countries; Economic values; Electrical components; Environmental factors; Freshwater bodies; Total dissolved solids; WEB application; Internet of things",,,,,,,"Haniffa, M.A.K., Jeya Sheela, P.A., Kavitha, K., Jais, A.M.M., Salutary value of haruan, the striped snakehead Channa striatus - A review (2014) Asian Pac.

With current computational power and algorithm, it is possi-ble to process big data, especially biomedical data, to find a complicated pattern with reasonable computation time. Computational approach for phosphorylation site prediction is more time-efficient and need fewer resources compared to traditional. However, the accuracy of current computational methods for phosphorylation site prediction still needs to be improved. This paper aims to create a computational method for phosphorylation site prediction with better classification performance compared to previous studies. The data used in this research to train the XGBoost models are extracted features from 2 different databases from the previous studies. The test result show that our model gave the highest accuracy on 4 out of 6 datasets. To extend our research, the XGBoost model was retrained which focused on 100 most important features from previous experiment. However, the result does not imply that it has a better result compared to our first models. As the result showing that our models gave better accuracy compared to the previous studies in most of the datasets, we can conclude that XGBoost model is better in predicting phosphorylation sites compared to other methods. © 2020 the author(s).","Gradient tree boosting; Phosphorylation; Post-translational modification; Prediction; Protein sequence; Proteomics; XGBoost",,,,,"Binus University","This research is a collaboration between the Department of Computer Science, University of Lampung, and Bioinformatics and Data Science Research Center (BDSRC), Bina Nusantara University.

The nature of dietary patterns of specific Indonesia population on the risk of colorectal cancer might differ from previously published data with the global population. Therefore, we conducted a study where the dietary pattern in colorectal cancer patient cohorts was compared to age- and population-matched control. We documented 89 colorectal cancer cases and among 173 individuals from the South Sulawesi population. A series of logistic regression and Fisher’s exact tests were utilized to test associations of dietary intakes and colorectal cancer risk as well as colorectal cancer staging. Our data demonstrate that vegetable (p-value = 8.70 × 10−26, OR = 0.49) and fruit (p-value = 7.59x10−5, OR = 0.70) intakes are associated with the reduced risk of colorectal cancer incidence. Conversely, acidic food, reheated food, meat, spicy food, and alcohol are associated with the increment case of cancer. Moreover, meat intake (p-value &lt; 0.01) shows a significant association with cancer staging progression. Common dietary pattern is a determinant aspect to the colorectal cancer incidence as well as its staging progression. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,"Mundade, R., Imperiale, T.F., Prabhu, L., Loehrer, P.J., Lu, T., Genetic pathways, prevention, and treatment of sporadic colorectal cancer (2014) Oncoscience, 1 (6), pp. 400-406;

The government tries to filter every negative content to be spread out during this period. However, to detect hate speech is not an easy task. This paper presents the process of developing a dataset that can be used to build a hate speech detection model. More than 1 million tweets have been successfully collected from using Twitter API. The basic preprocessing and preliminary study using machine learning was implemented. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was used to extract the topic for each tweet to see whether these topics can be associated with debate themes. Pretrained sentiment analysis was also applied to the dataset to generate a polarity score for each tweet. From 83,752 tweets included in the analysis step, the number of positive and negative tweets are almost the same. © 2019 IEEE.","cyberbullying; election; hate speech; LDA; sentiment analysis; twitter","Computer crime; Information management; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Speech; Statistics; Cyber bullying; election; Indonesian languages; Latent dirichlet allocations; Social media platforms; Speech detection; Spread outs; twitter; Speech recognition",,,,,"ACKNOWLEDGMENT This study is fully funded by internal Nusantara University.","grant from Bina","(2018) Ini Media Sosial Paling Populer di Indonesia, , https://databoks.katadata.co.id/datapublish/2018/02/01/media-sosialapa-yang-paling-sering-digunakan-masyarakat-Indonesia, [Accessed: 08-Jun-2019]; Laksana, N.C., (2018) Ini Jumlah Total Pengguna Media Sosial di Indonesia, , https://techno.okezone.com/read/2018/03/13/207/1872093/ini-jumlahtotal-pengguna-media-sosial-di-Indonesia, [Accessed: 08-Jun-2019]; Smith, P.K., Mahdavi, J., Carvalho, M., Fisher, S., Russell, S., Tippett, N., Cyberbullying: Its nature and impact in secondary school pupils (2008) J.

For instance, one of the cases in PA, automated plant counting, is able to accelerate the process of plantation monitoring. Despite many previous researches have developed information system for PA, there is no system which can be used for plant counting automation. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce an information system design that is crafted for automated plant counting.

Protein phosphorylation is used to regulate various enzyme and receptor activations which include signal pathways. There have been many significant studies conducted to predict phosphorylation sites using various machine learning methods. Recently, several researchers claimed deep learning based methods as the best methods for phosphorylation sited prediction. However, the performance of these methods were backed up with the massive training data used in the researches. In this paper, we study the performance of simple deep neural network on the limited data generally used prior to deep learning employment. The result shows that a deep neural network can still achieve comparable performance in the limited data settings. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Many people think that they have already met the suggested guidelines. However, most of them were wrong when they quantify their activity level using a personal activity tracker device. This problem indicates the need for personal physical activity tracker or wearable device to maintain the fitness level. However, as wide-range wearable devices available today, it is difficult to find the most suitable one regarding the price and quality. This paper proposes a study to explore the association between the quality and the price of the devices. The quality is evaluated by comparing the accuracy of the heart rate sensor and step counter of several wearable devices with the ground truth measurements. The test result is then analyzed using a series of statistical methods including, a paired t-test, Pearson's correlation test, and Bland-Altman plot. Both t-test and correlation coefficient is used to plot the association between quality and price. © 2019 The Authors.

In recent years, machine learning has gained significant attentions as a way to build a classifier from labeled data which also can be implemented to build a gender classifier. In this study we develop gender classifier using two different datasets with different languages, English and Bahasa Indonesia. Each data from both datasets is represented by 20 acoustic features. Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) is used to build the classification model using all these features and trained only on English dataset. This model is evaluated in both dataset to get the performance matrices consist of accuracy, AUROC, precision and recall.

It is also an important task which aimed to reduce the confounding by ancestry on the relationship of genotypes and disease risk in assocation studies. Several methods have been developed to generate the best ancestry estimated scores even though some of them are still facing inefficient computation time. In this paper, a combination method between KMeans clustering and PCA is proposed estimate ancestry estimation from SNP genotyping data. This method was compared with baseline model, called fastSTRUCTURE, in term of the quality of clustering and computation time. Public data from 1000 Genome project is used to train and evaluate the proposed model and the baseline model. The proposed model can successfully generate clusters with better accuracy than fastSTRUCTURE (91.02% over 90.39%). More importantly, it can boost the computation time until 100 times faster than fastSTRUCTURE (from 490 seconds to 4.86 seconds). © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

These are known as polygenic models and are useful in evaluating risk of disease in patients. These models, however, often do not include important non-genetic factors that are important to the prediction of the disease. In this paper, we explore the prediction of colorectal cancer in Indonesia from non-genetic factors using common machine learning algorithms: XGBoost and Elastic Net. The result of this study identified 8 features with strong importance from both XGBoost and Elastic Net. We recommend including these features as covariates in future genetic association studies of colorectal cancer in Indonesia. Ultimately these models may be implemented as tools to screen patients for colorectal cancer risk. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

One of its latest development is wearable device technology. Nowadays, the growth of this technology market is very positive. But unfortunately the growth of this technology is not followed by the availability of supporting applications that provide maximum benefits for users by utilizing personal health and activity data. This paper is intended to provide a report of our initial research in developing a health assistant solution that utilizes wearable device generated data. The whole research process is executed using Design Thinking approach that put the users as the main consideration. This initial research is started by designing a field research that can potentially gathered users' data generated from wearable device. A series of statistical and machine learning techniques are presented to analyze time series data to create a model. Finally, to implement the model, a mobile application prototype is also proposed.

These models can help select optimal rice varieties for expected field conditions. Development of a system to help scientist track and make decisions using this data is challenging. It involves incorporation of complex data structures - genomic, phenotypic, and remote sensing - with computationally intensive statistical modeling. In this article, the authors present a web portal designed to help researchers to manage and analyze their datasets, apply machine learning to detect how factors taken together influence crop production, and summarize the results to help scientists make decisions based on the learned models. The authors developed the system to be easily accessed by the entire team including rice scientist, genetics, and farmers. As such, they developed a system on a server architecture comprised of a SQLite database, a web interface developed in Python, the Celery job scheduler, and statistical computing in R.

One of these factors that can support the decision making for museum is visitors experiences during their visits. To gauge these collective experiences, visitor studies are conducted regularly by museums. Several visitor study approaches have been introduced, ranging from a simple field observation to sophisticated sensory devices. We proposed a new approach to monitor the behavior of museum visitors through the implementation of a computer vision software called Eyeface. The software was used to capture visitor data, including demographic information and engagement level data. These data can be used by museum to make a decision in rearranging its exhibition that can improve visitors engagement level. Additionally, the demographic data can be a basis information for museum to create particular events or promotions targeting some specific group of visitors. This approach was tested in three different museums; one was located in Edinburgh, UK while two were in Jakarta, Indonesia. © 2017 IEEE.","computer vision; decision support; engagement; museum; visitor study","Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Decision making; Decision support systems; Exhibitions; Internet of things; Population statistics; Decision supports; Demographic data; Demographic information; Edinburgh , UK; engagement; Engagement levels; Field observations; Visitor studies; Museums",,,,"Tree Research and Education Endowment Fund","This project was fully funded by Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP).",,"Bitgood, S., (2013) Attention and Value: Keys to Understanding Museum Visitors, , Routledge; Sandifer, C., Technological novelty and open-endedness: Two characteristics of interactive exhibits that contribute to the holding of visitor attention in a science museum (2003) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 40 (2), pp. 121-137; Hornecker, E., X201c;i don x2019;t understand it either, but it is cool x201d;-visitor interactions with a multi-touch table in a museum (2008) 2008 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Horizontal Interactive Human Computer Systems, pp. 113-120. , Oct; Hornecker, E., Interactions around a contextually embedded system (2010) Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction, TEI '10, pp. 169-176. , , (New York, NY, USA)ACM; Goulding, C., The museum environment and the visitor experience (2000) European Journal of Marketing, 34 (3-4), pp. 261-278; Sheng, C.-W., Chen, M.-C., A study of experience expectations of museum visitors (2012) Tourism Management, 33 (1), pp. 53-60; Falk, J.H., Dierking, L.D., (2013) Museum Experience Revisited, , Routledge; Bechtel, R.B., (1967) Method and Apparatus for Performing A Hodometer Floor Use Study, , Oct. 10.

To date, modern moving object detection methods require complex background modeling and thresholds tuning to confront illumination changes. This paper proposes an adaptive approach based on non-overlapping block texture representation. It aims to design a computationally light and efficient solution to improve the robustness of detection. We evaluate our proposed method on internal and public sequences and provide the quantitative and qualitative measurements. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the results of previous method and suitable for real-time challenges. © 2018 The Authors.

However, there are numerous difficulties in maintaining a reliable KM system. One of the challenges is to manage knowledge materials in video format. A video file contains complex data that lead to the difficulties in managing them. Without an intelligent system, managing videos for KM requires a laborious effort. In this paper, an intelligent framework for KM system, embedded with deep learning model, is proposed. The use of the deep learning model alleviates the heavy burden of video materials management in KM system. To enhance the agility of the system, mobile-based deep learning model is utilized in the framework. © 2018, International Association of Online Engineering.","Deep learning; Knowledge management; Mobile-based; Video classification",,,,,"Binus University","This study was supported by Artificial Intelligence Research & Development Center of Bina Nusantara University.",,"Birzniece, I., Artificial Intelligence in Knowledge Management: Overview and Trends (2011) Scientific Journal of Riga Technical University, 6, pp. 5-11. , https://doi.org/10.2478/v10143-011-0001-x; Zhang, Z.J., Jasimuddin, S.M., A model-based analysis for mobile knowledge management in organizations (2015) Journal of Management Analytics, 2 (1), pp. 35-52. , https://doi.org/10.1080/23270012.2015.1012232; LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., Hinton, G., Deep learning (2015) Nature, 521 (7553), pp. 436-444. , https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14539; Carreira, J., Zisserman, A., Quo Vadis, Action Recognition?

Abundance, distribution of organisms and patterns of biodiversity are great interests for many ecologists. One of interesting ecosystems to be studied is a cave. A cave has a typical environment character with a vulnerable ecosystem. Many caves in Indonesia, particularly in Gunungsewu karst area have been developed into tourist objects (show caves) and managed imprudently. Such cave management has potential to harm the environment and leads to ecosystem destruction. Arthropods are the most abundance fauna in cave that play critical roles in maintaining cave ecosystems equilibrium. In the heart of statistical ecology, we need to analyze the differences on Arthropods community and abiotic (climatic-edaphic) parameters among show caves and wild caves. Statistical techniques are needed for the extraction of such information. GLLVM is one method that is able to explain spatial-based information and is particularly suitable for ecology. In this paper, we use negative binomial models to see the differences on spatial patterns of predator and decomposer Arthropods, also characteristic of edaphic and climatic in each cave. © 2018 The Authors.

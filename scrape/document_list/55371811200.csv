Voting is also often used in determining something that are very important, such as determining people's representative council. In addition, the current voting is still using the Conventional system that uses paper in balloting, and vote counting. This can cause human error. The technology that is increasingly developing in the current era of globalization is e-voting. From this research, an e-vote system will be developed that applies the concept of the block chain node with smart contract. Smart contracts generate unique code for each new election. So that manipulation of election results will not be possible because each voter has only one account and one address block chain. From the results of the test the author can conclude that the smart contract block chain can be used to prove the results of a safe choice and create e-voting that is honest. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The competition between e-commerce is done to attract many customers so that they are interested to buy. Therefore, e-commerce is using many strategies e.g. value creation brand (ambassador, image, and origin). The purpose of this research is to look at the effect of brand value creation (ambassador, image, and origin) on the purchase intention of e-commerce customers in Indonesia. There are 3 hypotheses stated at the beginning of the research and to prove the hypothesis, 412 questionnaires were distributed for this research. The questionnaires are analyzed with multiple regression using Smart-PLS 3. The results of this research showed that brand image and origin affect the purchase intention of e-commerce customers in Indonesia while brand ambassador does not affect. © IJSTR 2020.","Brand ambassador; Brand image; Brand origin; E-commerce; Purchase intention; Value; Value creation brand",,,,,,,"Ferdinand, (2002) Manajemen Pemasaran.

This research aims to determine impact of the Review and Rating by adding a new variable that is trust. Respondents in this study used the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method with 110 respondents collected from internet users who have made online bookings. Respondent data is reduced because some do not comply with the provisions of the study to 100 respondents. The results obtained from this study proved that trust variables influence and increase consumer confidence in conducting online booking queues.

In running its business, Pegipegi has two platforms for the community to be able to access its services, namely through websites and mobile applications. Data shows that the majority of people access Pegipegi services through mobile applications. For the services offered, Pegipegi has a high rating. However, this cannot make Pegipegi the most visited OTA by the people of Indonesia. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the level of Pegipegi user loyalty is influenced by the user experience (UX) factor. UX measurements in this study were carried out using the user experience questionnaire (UEQ) method. Measurement data using the UEQ method will later be obtained using Microsoft Excel.

One of them is how a contract is made. Smart contract technology has offered a new, efficient, and secure way to automatically execute the terms of the agreement with no third-party to perform such contracts. The objective of this paper is to conduct a systematic overview of how the smart contract can bring opportunities and also challenges to Indonesia. We propose this paper due to the benefits Indonesian businesses will have by implementing smart contracts. Apart from the benefits, in Indonesia, there are still very few journals discussing smart contracts implementation. In this paper, there will be our findings of how smart contracts are utilized currently in industries, the challenges, and the current smart contract in Indonesia. The result will be used as guidance when considering, planning, and applicating smart contracts in Indonesia. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The level of activity of lecturers in class and using learning media such as Smart lecturer can be measured using a fuzzy logic approach. This study aims to measure the level of active lecturers using the approach, namely: Mamdani and Sugeno method. Stages of lecturer activity measurement by forming a fuzzy set, composition rules as many as 24 rules and the defuzzification process using the centroid method that produces the level of activity of each is low, medium and high. Based on 173 lecturer activity data, the results of the Mamdani method indicates low 66%, medium 31%, and high 3%. While the Sugeno method produces a level of activity low 75%, moderate 17%, and high 8%. Therefore, Mamdani method is more suitable for the calculation because the spread of results is relatively evenly distributed at each level. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,"McCabe, A., O'Connor, U., Student-centred learning: The role and responsibility of the lecturer (2014) Teaching in Higher Education, 19, pp. 350-359; Cavanagh, M., Students' experiences of active engagement through cooperative learning activities in lectures (2011) Active Learning in Higher Education, 12, pp. 23-33; Cano-Hurtado, J.J., Carot-Sierra, J.M., Fernandez-Prada, M.A., Fargueta, F., (2011) An Evaluation Model of the Teaching Activity of Academic Staff, , http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/4/29/43977296.pdf; Cadez, S., Dimovski, V., Zaman Groff, M., Research, teaching and performance evaluation in academia: The salience of quality (2017) Studies in Higher Education, 42, pp. 1455-1473; Jeffrey, L.M., Milne, J., Suddaby, G., Higgins, A., Blended learning: How teachers balance the blend of online and classroom components (2014) Journal of Information Technology Education, 13; De Freitas, S.I., Morgan, J., Gibson, D., Will MOOCs transform learning and teaching in higher education?

In Indonesia, the integrated timber industry had implemented information systems management in the field of sustainable forest management. Existing information systems developed by IT departments that exist in the company. However, the development of information systems does not have the information systems strategic planning in IT departments. The system development processes no priority system what information should be done. Therefore, it is necessary to make strategic planning of information systems to support and assist the IT team in the process of system development. This study discussed information systems strategic plans using the framework Ward & Peppard. It conducted an internal and external analysis of IS/IT. For the analysis of the company's internal and external analysis need not be performed but was replaced with the existing strategy in the company.

Stemming is the process of combining or solving each morphological variants of a word into a basic word. Based on the basic structure of the word morphology, Porter's stemming looks appropriate to be applied in conducting basic word searches in Indonesian-language documents, but with a few modifications. For this need, an Information Retrieval Technique for Indonesian PDF Document Application Using PHP from Indonesian documents is made using the Modified Stemming Porter Method. Implementation of the application was carried out using the Php (Hypertext Preprocessor) programming language. Testing was performed on 26 pdf e-book documents are 23,197 basic words out of 28,532 total words. the experiment found 94% as the largest percentage of precision words in the document.

The variables used are Perceived Ease of Used, Perceived of Usefulness and Behavioral Intention to Use of the main Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) variables that can be influenced by Trust, Review and Rating. This study aims to determine the impact of the Review and Rating by adding a new variable that is trust. Respondents in this study used the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method with 110 respondents collected from internet users who have made online bookings. Respondent data is reduced because some do not comply with the provisions of the study to 100 respondents. The results obtained from this study proved that trust variables influence and increase consumer confidence in conducting online booking queues. Both Rating and Review have an influence on Trust. The Review of Trust is more influential than the Rating of Trust, this is evidenced by the p-value Review of Trust (0,000) is lower than the p-value Rating of Trust (0,026). Therefore, online marketplace companies must make and improve reviews and ratings as one of the main marketing tools to increase consumer confidence and company revenue. © 2019 IEEE.","Behavioral Intention; Online Booking; Rating; Review; Trust","Electronic commerce; Information use; Behavioral intention; Internet users; Jakarta; Marketing tools; On-line marketplaces; P-values; Structural equation modeling; Technology acceptance model; Information systems",,,,,,"APJII & Puskakom UI (2016) Profil Pengguna Internet Indonesia, , Jakarta: Puskakom UI&APJII; Davis, F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3), pp. 319-339; Fishbein, M., Ajzen, I., Belief, attitude, intention, and behaviour: An introduction to theory and research (1975) Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley; Venkatesh, V., Bala, H., Technology Acceptance Model 3 and a Research Agenda on Interventions (2008) Decision Sciences, 39 (2); Surendran, P., Technology acceptance model: A survey of literature (2012) International Journal of Business and Social Research (IJBSR), 2 (4), pp. 175-178; Chuttur, M.Y., Overview of the technology acceptance model: Origins (2009) Development and Future Directions, 9. , USA, Indians University.

The algorithms used are Naive Bayes (NB). Then to optimize the accuracy of the calculation results, the Particle Swarm Optimization (NB-PSO) approach is used. In order to optimize accurate results, this study uses three experimental sequences (scenario 1, scenario 2, and scenario 2) for both NB and NB-PSO algorithms. Each scenario uses different positive and negative comments. The results of the experiment show that in scenario 1 an increase in accuracy is 10.00% for NB-PSO. Scenario 2 there is an increase in accuracy of 13.33% on NB-PSO. Meanwhile, in scenario 3 an increase in accuracy is 27.22% for NB-PSO. These results prove that the accuracy of NB-PSO is better than NB for all scenarios. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The need for performance improvements that can directly improve the quality of inpatient health services is a major problem. The role of doctors and nurses' knowledge becomes a benchmark in determining the performance and quality of services, in this case the Knowledge Management System (KMS) can be a solution in supporting the knowledge management process. However, the growth of innovation in knowledge management is also needed in practice. So Big Data as a large data processing technology and various types of data will be a supporter in the process of increasing and accelerating the growth of knowledge of doctors and nurses at the XYZ ISLAMIC HOSPITAL by providing relevant information as needed. Then it is necessary to design a KMS that uses Big data as one of the enablers in the process of creating knowledge for doctors and nurses and then can be stored and shared. This design is done by using the Knowledge Management System Agile Implementation Methodology (KMSAIM) which prioritizes the initiation process in each problem domain so that each component has the right and relevant solutions. The KMS design results are in the form of site-based applications that have file sharing features, discussion forums for sharing medical experiences and there are search features needed by doctors and nurses for inpatient services at XYZ ISLAMIC HOSPITAL. © 2019 IEEE","Big Data; Inpatient Medical Service; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Management System","Benchmarking; Big data; Data handling; Hospital data processing; Hospitals; Knowledge based systems; Nursing; Discussion forum; Health services; Implementation methodology; Initiation process; Inpatient services; Knowledge management process; Knowledge management system; Medical services; Knowledge management",,,,,,"Andreas, B., (2016) Knowledge Management: Efektif Berinovasi Meraih Sukses, , Jakarta, Indonesia: Prasetiya Mulya Publishing; Khasawneh, R., Abu-Shanab, E., Using KMS as a tool to improve decision making process (2013) Knowledge-Based Processes in Software Development, pp. 1-11. , January 2016; Rahimli, A., Knowledge management and competitive advantage (2012) Information and Knowledge Management, pp. 37-43; Nonaka, I., Toyama, R., The knowledge-creating theory revisited: Knowledge creation as a synthesizing process (2003) Knowl.

In increasing the value of its business, many hospitals open branches in various regions so that it requires integration from each branch. However, there is often a failure of IT (Information Technology) implementation because there is no alignment with the objectives of the organization where each hospital incorporated in the group still works independently. Enterprise Architecture is one solution to overcome the failure of IT implementation in organizations. This study aims to build Enterprise Architecture in the hospital group. The case study to support this research was conducted in one of the hospital groups in Indonesia namely Kasih Group. The method used is a combination of ESIA (Eliminate, Simplify, Integrate, Automate) and TOGAF ADM (The Open Group Architecture Framework Architecture Development Method). The results of this study are the Enterprise Architecture design in the hospital group which consists of 5 phases, namely: business engineering, initialize architecture, business architecture development, information system architecture and develop technology architecture. © 2019 IEEE","Enterprise architecture; ESIA; Hospital group; TOGAF ADM","Business architecture; Business engineering; Development method; Enterprise Architecture; ESIA; Information system architecture; Open group architecture frameworks; Technology architectures; Hospitals",,,,,,"Purnawan, D.A., Surendro, K., Building enterprise architecture for hospital information system (2016) Fourth International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies (ICoICT); Sajid, M., Ahsan, K., Enterprise architecture for healthcare organizations (2014) World Applied Sciences Journal, 30 (10), pp. 1330-1333. , 2014; Shah, H., Ahsan, K., Kingston, P., Healthcare modelling through enterprise architecture: A hospital case (2010) Seventh International Conference on Information Technology, pp. 460-465; Bobarshad, H., Rezaei, M.S., Saghafi, F., Hospital enterprise architecture framework (Study of iranian university hospital organization) (2018) International Journal of Medical Informatics; Rijo, R., Martinho, R., Ermida, D., (2015) Developing an Enterprise Architecture Proof of Concept in a Portuguese Hospital, , Elsevier B; Handayani, P.W., Pinem, A.A., Munajat, Q., Azzahro, F., Hidayanto, A.N., Ayuningtyas, D., Sartono, A., Health referral enterprise architecture design in Indonesia (2019) The Korean Society of Medical Informatics; Qurratuaini, H., Designing enterprise architecture based on TOGAF 9.1 framework (2018) International Conference on Engineering and Applied Technology (ICEAT); Wikusna, W., (2017) Enterprise Architecture Model for Vocational High School, , School of Applied Science, Telkom University; Nugroho, H., Proposed IT governance at hospital based on COBIT 5 framework (2017) School of Applied Science, , Telkom University; Sajid, M., Ahsan, K., Role of enterprise architecture in healthcare organizations and knowledge-based medical diagnosis system (2016) Journal of Information Systems and Technology Management; Microservices Reference Architecture, , www.ibm.com, Online.Available:https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/architectures/ microservices/reference-architecture.

The application is divided into two, namely OVO Cash and OVO Point. OVO Cash can be used for various types of financial transactions, such as payments at various merchant partners, top up, and balance checking. At present, it's easy to make transactions quickly and easily using OVO Cash. OVO Points are loyalty rewards obtained by OVO users when making transactions at various OVO partner merchants. The advantages of the OVO application with the mobile payment application is that the OVO application can make payment transactions for parking rates at the mall. For example, the Lippo mall in the Jakarta area has implemented the first automate self-parking payment system in Indonesia and the parking fee payment is operated in May 2017. This case study aims to find out the receipt of the OVO payment mobile application as a payment for tariffs. parking, in this study uses the UTAUT model as a research method in order to find out whether performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions influence the behavior intention on the OVO mobile payment application. Through regression statistical test analysis as processing data obtained from questionnaires with the number of 100 respondents using the OVO mobile payment application as a payment tool for parking rates. The data collection technique carried out is a non-probability approach that is using purposive sampling.

Manual transcription is certainly not effective and tiring for publishers that have large archives. Therefore, more automated transcription is required. As a part of that effort, this paper proposes OCR error correction of old spelling news articles utilizing new spelling databases. Spelling conversions which based on pattern are used to bridge spelling differences. The Error detection uses dictionary lookup and the phenomenon of word repetition and OCR errors that mostly are non-word errors. The Dictionary is built from KBBI and enriched with derivative words, English words, and entity names from validated news archives. Confix-stripping stemmer is used to validate derivative words while the English dictionary is used to validate English words in the news archive. The Error correction uses context-based methods by searching the phrase trigram/bigram word for each error in Google, then the Google Spelling suggestions are used as the correction. Experiments on 9 texts of OCR result of KOMPAS daily article between 1965 and 1966 is resulting the comparison of error rate before and after the correction (improvement ratio) of 193.01% compared to Hunspell spell checker of 61.47%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Dictionary; Error Correction; Error Detection; Google Spelling Suggestion; Optical Character Recognition; Repetition; Stemmer","Error correction; Glossaries; Newsprint; Optical character recognition; Transcription; Dictionary lookup; Digital archives; Google Spelling Suggestion; Improvement ratio; Old newspapers; Repetition; Stemmer; Textual content; Error detection",,,,,,"Mika, K., Kimmo, K., Tuula, P., (2017) Proceedings of the 21st Nordic Conference on Computational Linguisticslmproving Optical Character Recognition of Finnish Historical Newspapers with A Combination of Fraktur & Antiqua Models and Image Preprocessing; Bukhari, S.S., Kadi, A., Jouneh, M.A., Mir, F.M., Dengel, A., (2017) 14th IAPR International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR) AnyOCR: An Open-Source OCR System for Historical Archives; Xiang, T., David, A.E., Fourth Workshop on Very Large Corpora (1996) A Statistical Approach to Automatic OCR Error Correction in Context; Kukich, K., Techniques for automatically correcting words in text (1993) Proceedings of the 1993 ACM Conference on Computer Science - CSC 93, p. 515; Eric, B., Robert, C.M., An improved error model for noisy channel spelling correction (2000) Proceedings of the 38th Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics.

The source of JSON files that searched comes from the generated journal files that have been extracted from the title and the keywords. This retrieval system is designed using the Vector Space Model method to obtain optimal searching results by looking for similarity of query words with the documents sought. This system is made with Java programming based object-oriented so that it can be implemented on many platforms and operating systems. This system reads all the words in the JSON file, then filters it for the stopword list to remove it. Then the stemming process is carried out to find the basic word. Stemming results are indexed to store the number of word frequencies in each document, the indexing results are stored in memory to speed up the searching. When a user searches, the system will search for indexing results based on query words, then weighting TF-IDF each word searched and calculated similarity with the Cosine Similarity formula with related documents. All related documents will be sorted descending based on the scoring value of the similarity. The word search process in this system more or less takes 150-300 milliseconds in JSON documents which amount to 140. © 2019 IEEE.","Inverse Document Frequency; Java; JSON; Term Frequency; Vector Space Model","Artificial intelligence; Indexing (of information); Information retrieval; Object oriented programming; Text processing; Vector spaces; Inverse Document Frequency; Java; JSON; Term Frequency; Vector space models; Search engines",,,,,,"Bagga, A., Baldwin, B., Entity-based cross-document coreferencing using the Vector Space Model (1998) ACL '98/COLING '98 Proceedings of the 36th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and 17th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, 1, pp. 79-85; Smith, B., (2015) Beginning JSON.

Although it has been widely used by various universities, there is always effort to increase the interest of the user using a system of online learning which can be measured through user experience. Several quantitative and qualitative studies have been conducted to measure online learning from the aspect of the user experience; however, such a study is still arranged separately. This research discusses user experience measurement using two methods, namely user experience questioner (UEQ) as a quantitative study and evaluation heuristics (HE) as a qualitative study. The data retrieving in the measurement of user experience is run by distributing questionnaires to 100 students of the online-learning program in University xyz. Subsequently, the data was analyzed by employing UEQ and HE. The research results showed that the input and suggestions form users online learning is relatively similar. Results on UEQ attractiveness resulted in highest value and the novelty aspect of the lowest. While the results HE all aspects which had a good evaluation of the results, however there is still deficiencies which in the measurement HE will further detailing of which parts should be more focused on. On the final results, there are suggestions that HE may be the fix for combining UEQ and HE cannot be done, because each has its own distinctive aspects in the measurement.

This case study discusses what factors influence the success of an institution or organization in terms of implementing E-learning especially for the instructor or teacher concerned. There are five (5 factors) studied where busyness, attitude, curriculum, technology are used and mindset as the reason teachers use E-learning. The method used is a quantitative method using a questionnaire and distributed to the respondents (middle and high school teachers). The results of the analysis state that there is no significant influence from the factor of busyness, and the mindset of success in the implementation of E-learning. Attitude, curriculum and technology have a significant influence. As a result, simultaneous testing of all independent variables has significant results on the success of E-learning implementation. The conclusion of this study is that it can be a recommendation for school leaders to register an internet address domain so that e-learning can be accessed by teachers and students from outside to be able to do the task through E-learning. © IAEME Publication.","E-learning; E-learning management system; Education; Success factors",,,,,,,"Chen, H.-R., Tseng, H.F., Factors that influence acceptance of web-based e-learning system in-service education of junior high school teachers in Taiwan (2012) Evaluation and Program Planning, pp. 398-406; Utami, I.S., Implementasi E-Learning untuk meningkatkan aktivitas belajar siswa (2016) Jurnal Politeknik Caltex Riau, pp. 169-178; Sutrabri, T., (2012) Konsep Sistem Informasi, , Yogyakarta: Andi Offset; Conford, T., Shaikh, M., (2013) Introduction of Information System, , London: University of London; Shelly, B.G., Rosenblatt, J.H., (2012) Analysis and Designs for Systems, , Elizabeth City, North Carolina: Course Technology Cengage Learning; Clark, R.C., Mayer, E.R., Learning By Viewing versus Learning By Doing (2008) Evidence - Based Guidelines for Principled Learning Environments, 47 (9). , October number; Agustina, M., Pemanfaatan E-Learning sebagai Media Pembelajaran (2013) Seminar Nasional Aplikasi Teknologi Informasi (SNATI), pp. 8-12; Limantara, N., Jingga, F., Perancangan model learning management system Untuk sekolah (2014) Comtech E-Learning, pp. 203-212; Chewe, P., Chitumbo, E.M., Moodle adoption at the University of Zambia (2012) Science Journal of Sociology and Anthropology; Pradnyana, G.A., Pradnyana, I.M., Implementasi Responsive E-learning Berbasis MOODLE Untuk Menunjang Kegiatan Pembelajaran di STMIK STIKOM Indonesia (2015) Jurnal Ilmu Komputer Dan Sains, pp. 127-135; Hsu, Y.-S., Wu, H.-K., Hwang, F.-K., Factors influence junior high school teachers' computer based instructional practices regarding their instructional evolution stages (2007) Educational Technology & Society, pp. 118-130; Sallam, N., Alzouebi, K., Teacher perception of the use of Moodle to enhance the quality of teaching and learning in a K-12 private school in the United Arab Emirates (2014) Teacher Perceptions of The Use of Moodle, pp. 93-101; Goi, C.L., Ng, P.Y., Success Factors in Implementing E-learning Program (2009) E-Learning in Malaysia, pp. 237-246; Agustina, R., Santosa, P.I., Ferdiana, R., Sejarah, tantangan dan faktor keberhasilan dalam pengembangan e-learning (2016) Seminar Nasional Sistem Informasi Indonesia, p. 10; Wijaya, M., Pengembangan Model Pembelajaran e-Learning Berbasis Web dengan Prinsip e-Pedagogy dalam Meningkatkan Hasil Belajar (2012) Jurnal Pendidikan Penabur, pp. 20-37; Hasbullah, Perancangan Dan Implementasi Model Pembelajaran E-Learning Untuk Meningkatkan Kualitas Pembelajaran di JPTE FPTK UPI (2008) E-Learning, 1; Hratinski, S., Asynchronouse and synchronous e-learning (2008) Educase Quarterly, pp. 51-55; Kisanga, Determintans of Teachers' attittude towards E-learning in Tanzanian Higher Learning Institutions (2016) International Review of Research In Open and Distributed Learning, 17 (5). , H., D Number; Lord, T.A., Critical success factors in online education (2000) Nt.

In order to perform KPI measurement of its employees based on teleworking, this research uses balanced scorecard method approach that is by taking into account financial, customer, and internal business process and learning and growth perspective. The results of this study are the design proposal KPI employees to accommodate telework at the company. Then KPI employee test results showed an increase in the average value of the employee KPI of 0.295 points (9.47%) of the old KPI. Thus, it is recommended to the company to implement the employee KPI. Copyright © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

One of the most commonly used software project estimation models is Constructive Cost Model(COCOMO II). The model is often used to obtain accurate results in estimating important factors such as cost and human resources. However, to obtain the more accurate estimation results, this study proposes a C4.5 algorithm based on COCOMO II estimation results. In this study, software project estimates are used in the Point of Sales (POS) applications. Based on these data with COCOMO II method, it is estimated that the schedule, staff, and cost are also specifying estimation from the result of COCOMO II using a C4.5 algorithm. The accuracy of the estimation results is around 90% with Algorithm C4.5. The value can be used as a reference for the development of the next POS software project. © 2018 IEEE.","algorithm C4.5; cocomo II; decision tree; point of sales; software project estimation","Application programs; Data mining; Decision trees; Sales; Software design; Trees (mathematics); Work simplification; Accurate estimation; C4.5 algorithm; COCOMO II; Constructive cost models; Estimation results; Point of sale; Software project; Software project estimates; Cost estimating",,,,,,"Sharma, T.N., Analysis of software cost estimation using COCOMO II (2011) International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, 2 (6), pp. 1-5; Zivadinovi, J., Medi, Z., Maksimovi, D., Damnjanovi, A., Vuji, S., Methods of effort estimation in software engineering (2011) International Symposium Engineering Management and Competitiveness, , June), Zrenjanin, Serbia; Dillibabu, R., Krishnaiah, K., Cost estimation of a software product using COCOMO II. 2000 model-a case study (2005) International Journal of Project Management, 23 (4), pp. 297-307; Huang, X., Ho, D., Ren, J., Capretz, L.F., Improving the cocomo model using a neurofuzzy approach (2011) Applied Soft Computing, 7 (1), pp. 29-40; Song, Q., Shepperd, M., Chen, X., Liu, J., Can KNN imputation improve the performance of C4.5 with small software project data sets A comparative evaluation (2008) The Journal of Systems and Software, 81, pp. 2361-2370; Gharehchopogh, F.S., Maleki, I., Kamalinia, A., Zadeh, H.M., Artificial bee colony based constructive cost model for software cost estimation (2014) Journal of Scientific Research and Development, 1 (2), pp. 44-51; Mao, K., Yang, Y., Li, M., Harman, M., Pricing crowdsourcing-based software development tasks (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 1205-1208. , May, IEEE Press; Chemuturi, M., (2009) Software Estimation Best Practices, , Tools & Techniques: A Complete Guide for Software Project Estimators, USA: J.

Blended learning refers to combining traditional classroom learning with e-learning with the aims to enrich entire learning process. From the last decade, we have seen the strong growth of millenials students in Indonesian higher education institutions. They developed high familiarity with Internet technology, social media and smartphone uses. The needs of adopting social media into blended learning has become essential part in blended learning mode nowadays. For this reason, the article takes a popular method, Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) enables to enrich the entire e-learning environment. We apply the VLE dashboard with adopting the Web-based Synchronized Multimedia Lecture (WSML) framework that enables to provide authoring tool to record the temporal and spatial relationships among media involved and facilitate synchronize presentation across media access. This framework has advantages to promote the real-time collaboration amongst students and teacher(s), like in a classroom setting, but with online mode. VLE takes advantages of web 2.0 and social media technology that enables to conduct real time meeting with video conference and easy exchange multimedia files. The outcome of the article is expected to provide social media learning based system that can be apply in higher education institutions to avoid boredom in traditional blended learning. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Computer aided instruction; Electronic document exchange; Multimedia services; Social networking (online); Students; Teaching; Classroom settings; E-learning environment; Effective learning; Higher education institutions; Internet technology; Real-time collaboration; Temporal and spatial; Virtual learning environments; E-learning",,,,,,"Bhutawale, S., Sakharkar, P., What Is E-Learning?; Riahi, G., E-learning systems based on cloud computing: A review (2015) Procedia Comput Sci., 62, pp. 352-359. , Scse; Gikas, J., Grant, M.M., Mobile computing devices in higher education: Student perspectives on learning with cellphones, smartphones & social media (2013) Internet High Educ., 19, pp. 18-26; Hassanzadeh, A., Kanaani, F., Elahi, S., A model for measuring e-learning systems success in universities (2012) Expert Syst Appl., 39 (12), pp. 10959-10966; Mason, R., Rennie, F., E-Learning and Social Networking Handbook (2008) British Journal of Educational Technology, 40, p. 189; Gibson, L.A., Sodeman, W.A., Millennials and technology: Addressing the communication gap in education and practice (2014) Organ Dev J., 32, pp. 63-75; Lister, M., Trends in the Design of E-Learning and Online Learning (2014) J Online Learn Teach., 10, pp. 671-680; Al-Adwan, A., Al-Adwan, A., Smedley, J., Exploring students acceptance of e-learning using Technology Acceptance Model in Jordanian universities (2013) Int J Educ Dev Using Inf Commun Technol., 9, pp. 4-18; Zakarian, S., (2013) Abstract Education and Social Media: An Examination of Facebook, Twitter and Youtube in K-12 Education, , May 2013; Scholar, M.D., Thoene, W.S., (2012) The Impact of Social Networking Sites on College Students' Consumption Patterns; Panekham, A., (2014) Exploring the Role Social Media Plays in the Student Learning Experience of 2014 University Life in NZ, p. 79. , November; Scott, K.M., Does a university teacher need to change e-learning beliefs and practices when using a social networking site?

Organization that has lack of IT governance also experiences lack of good corporate governance. As a result, the organization has difficulties to link its IT benefits to organization's objectives. In some cases, the lack of IT governance even causes severe impacts to school management. The article takes case of a higher institution, STMIK MBM, one of popular IT school in North Sulawesi, that has experienced with frequent IT interruption. The frequent IT interruption has caused severe consequences not only to current school operation, but also to the reputation of the school. In the beginning year of 2017, the ineffective academic data management has caused the severe interruption of school operation and led to the change of school management. To promote IT good governance, the new school director has initiative to apply COBIT 5, as an effective IT governance framework for the school. The article provides an analysis of COBIT 5 implementation with the objectives to provide a reference for major school stakeholders to understand and develop effective business and IT policy. The outcome is expected to provide insight of good IT governance for higher education institution. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Condensed matter physics; Engineering; Industrial engineering; Materials science; Corporate governance; Good governances; Higher education; Higher education institutions; IT governance; IT policies; Information management",,,,,,"Yanosky, R., Caruso, J.B., Process and politics: IT governance in higher education (2008) ECAR Key Find.; Paradeise, C., Reale, E., Bleiklie, I., Ferlie, E., (2009), (Springer: University governance); Al, O.L., Barnes, P.H., Pitman, G., Optimising COBIT 5 for IT Governance: Examples from the Public Sector (2012) Appl Theor Inf Syst Res., pp. 2-14; Adikara, F., Implementasi Tata Kelola Teknologi Informasi Perguruan Tinggi Berdasarkan Cobit 5 Pada Laboratorium Rekayasa Perangkat Lunak (2013) J Tek Inform Univ Esa Unggul., pp. 1-6; Kaban, I.E., Tata kelola teknologi informasi (2009) CommIT., 3, pp. 1-5; Macgregor, S., (2011) COBIT 5 and TOGAF 9.

It has become the most popular business in the world. People around the world could shop between countries in ease. An online shopping website could be the source of success not only because it contains useful information, but also because it displays information in a way that is easily recognizable by its users. To compete with other competitor it is important to find out the effectiveness of a site is by examining users' visual preferences while using web pages. This research is done to find out what customers’ preferences by using eye tracking methods and questionnaire method. The two methods are then being compared to find out wether there are any similarities or any cross section within the two. There are several things which are measured; the relation between aspect of information quality; system quality; service quality; user readiness and user satisfaction. The quantitative data are gained through questionnaire and eye tracking test by distributing the questionnaires to online shopping customers. The analysis of data indicated that both research methods using questionnaires and eye tracking are extremely different that they cannot be compared. Apart from that the results of the evaluation of both websites using the method of eye tracking shows that both sites are in accordance with the expectations of the site maker. © 2005 – on going JATIT & LLS.","Customer satisfaction; E-commerce; Eye tracking; Research; Website",,,,,,,"Ketut, K.W., (2014) Survei Website E-Commerce Paling Populer Di Indonesia, , https://id.techinasia.com/survei-website-ecommerce-populer-indonesia, 16 September; Schenkman, B.N., Jönsson, F.U., Aesthetics and Preferences of Web Pages (2000) Behaviour and Information Technology, 19 (5), pp. 367-377; Marakas, G.M., O'brien, J.A., (2013) Introduction to Information Systems, 16. , New York, New York State: The McGraw Hill Companies; Wu, W.-Y., Lee, C.-L., Fu, C.-S., Wang, H.-C., How Can Online Store Layout Design and Atmosphere Influence Consumer Shopping Intention on a Website?

Furthermore, the development of Service Oriented Architecture technology is now adopted in various fields. The use of Smart Agriculture System can help people who work in an agricultural sector. Components in Smart Agriculture Systems integrated an entity such as hotel, hospital, logistic, restaurant, supermarket and traditional market who can get a message, information, and data throughout Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). Service Oriented Architecture help to share information and data very quickly because using SOA connects various actors in the material sales industry. The usage of SOA in the field of agriculture is expected to help the economy in Indonesia and also can suppress prices so it will not soar. This high price is caused by various factors such as lack of technological knowledge among farmers. There are still many brokers who become third parties from the distribution of agricultural food ingredients in Indonesia. With the implementation of SOA, it is expected to help farmers for a better living. © 2018 IEEE.","Agriculture; Enterprise Service Bus; Service Oriented Architecture; Smart Agriculture Systems","Agriculture; Information services; Information systems; Information use; Agricultural foods; Agricultural sector; Enterprise service bus; High price; Smart agricultures; Technological knowledge; Third parties; Traditional markets; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,,"Indonesia, S., (2016) Badan Pusat Statistik.

E-billing is available in the form of web-based and mobile applications in order to facilitate the public in making payments. However, in reality, there are still many people who prefer to use traditional methods of paying taxes.

In 2016, there were estimated more than 180 million internet users and have reached 40% of 250 million total inhabitants. Based on the surveys, there are four most popular online vendors in Indonesia, such as: Lazada, Tokopedia, OnLine eXchange and Bukalapak, with strong customer bases. Due to its tremendous growth, however, there is still very few studies can be found to understand the characteristics of e-marketplace in Indonesia. For this reason, the article examines those most popular online vendors in Jakarta area, where the most buyers tend to have more experiences in conducting online purchases. The article utilizes the revised TAM as a valuable method to assess the important factors of online purchases such as: buyer and satisfaction factors, that comprised of: buyer perceived risk, seller’s expertise and reputation, and convenience of buying. The findings are aimed to address the important factors that can be used to increase buyer satisfaction. The outcomes of the study are expected to provide valuable guidance for all e-sellers and buyers to understand Indonesian e-marketplace. © 2018 Universidad de Talca - Chile.","Buyers; E-marketplace; Indonesian e-marketplaces; Revised-technology acceptance model; Satisfaction; Trust",,,,,,,"Ansori, M., Consumerism and the emergence of a new middle class in globalizing Indonesia (2009) Explorations a Graduate Student Journal of Southeast Asian Studies, 9; Awais, M., Tanzila, S., Advanced SWOT analysis of e-commerces (2012) International Journal of Computer Science Issues, 9 (2), pp. 569-574; Banerjee, V., Duflo, E., What is middle class about the middle classes around the world?

In this study, we present the main factors behind the E-learning for the Equivalency Education Program (E-LEEP) initiative in Indonesia. There are four main factors proposed, namely: standardization, learning materials, learning process, and learners' characteristics. Each factor supports each other to achieve the learning process of E-LEEP in Indonesia.

There is a lack of development of e-learning in a remote city like Kupang East Nusa Tenggara Indonesia which is located far away from the capital city. This research aims to assess the effectiveness of e-learning by analyzing three factors in one of the higher institution in Kupang city, i.e. Sekolah Tinggi Kesehatan Citra Mandiri Husada Kupang (STIKes CHMK). The factors include culture, technology and infrastructure, and content satisfaction. The data were collected using questionnaires. Research shows that with proper preparation for e-learning, the acceptance of e-learning in rural areas is significantly high. This finding suggests that e-learning can greatly benefit the students like Kupang city in developing countries. Copyright © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

A pre-test is given to measure the proficiency level of learners. The level is divided into elementary, intermediate and advanced. The ALS-KL provides the most suitable materials according to the needs of the learners. We applied the proposed system on 90 learners with different English proficiency level. The effectiveness of the system was evaluated using post-test. The results of the posttest showed that the proposed system was able to improve learners with intermediate- level and advanced level 1.5 times and 4 times respectively while reducing the number of learners with elementary-level by more than 50%.

Indonesian enterprises have experience with a huge amount of investments and ended up with minor benefits. Despite its unprecedented benefits, the SAP strategy is still considered as a mandatory enterprise system for every enterprise to compete in the marketplaces. The article examines the SAP implementation from cultural perspectives to present new horizon that commonly ignored by major Indonesian enterprises. The article applies the multiple case studies with three large Indonesia enterprises, such as KS, the largest steel producer; GEM, a subsidiary of conglomerate enterprise operates in the mining industry, and HS, a subsidiary of the largest retailer in Asia with more than 700 stores in Indonesia.

To achieve this improvement, this study proposed learning style, motivation, and knowledge ability (triple-factor) to add value creation model of an e-Learning system. In order to accommodate the model, this study has explored the triple-factor in e-learning process using online learning at Learning Management System (LMS) Binus Online Learning. The results of the study showed that there was a tendency that e-Learning values (good (Y2) and very good (Y3)) were influenced by learning styles (X2 (30.23%) and X3 (46.51%)), motivation (X5 (27.91%) and X6 (48.84%)), knowledge ability factor (X9 (44.19%) and X10 (30.23%)). Meanwhile the e-learning value of less than satisfactory (Y1) influenced by Learning Styles (X1 (23.26%)), motivation (X4 (23.26%)), knowledge ability factor (X7 (20.93%) and X8 (4.65%)). Thus, this study has proven that the existence of triple-factor that reflect the relationship between e-learning value, and those factors (learning styles, motivation, and knowledge ability). The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the existence of these factors to support a model of value creation in e-Learning process. © 2016 IEEE.","e-learning; triple-factor; value","Learning systems; Motivation; Knowledge abilities; Learning management system; Learning outcome; Learning Style; Online learning; triple-factor; value; Value creation; E-learning",,,,,,"Sfenrianto, H.Z.A., Suhartanto, H., The influence factors of inherent structure in e-learning process (2011) International Journal of E-Education, E-Business, E-Management and E-Learning, 1 (3), pp. 217-222; Naser-Nick, M., The influence of learning styles on learners in e-Learning environments: An empirical study (2006) Computers in Higher Education Economics Review, 18 (1), pp. 10-14; El-Seoud, M.S.A., El-Khouly, M., Taj-Eddin, I.A.T.F., Strategies to enhance learner's motivation in e-Learning environment (2015) Proceeding of 2015 International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning (ICL ), pp. 944-949. , Florence, Italy, September; Sfenrianto, H.H., Hasibuan, Z.A., Selviandro, N., An approach to detect learning types based on triple-factor in e-learning process (2014) Journal of Next Generation Information Technology, 5 (1), pp. 9-15; Amit, R., Zott, C., Value creation in e-business (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22 (6), pp. 493-520; Zaborek, P., Doligalski, T., Sysko-Romahczuk, S., Value creation in e-business and financial performance: Researching Polish online companies with Amit and Zott's model (2013) 4th EMAC Regional Conference, pp. 25-27. , St. Petersburg, Russia, September; Alawneh, A.A., Younis, M.B., Drivers of ebusiness value creation in banking sector Jordan: A structural equation modeling application (2014) International Journal of Managing Information Technology, 6 (2), pp. 149-164; Christensen, G., Leif, M., Value creation in ebusiness: Exploring the impacts of internet-enabled business conduct (2003) Proceeding of 6th Bled ECommerce Conference ETransformation Bled, pp. 27-43. , Slovenia, June; Pedro, S., Angel, L.M., Analyzing e-business value creation from a resource-based perspective (2008) International Journal of Information Management: The Journal for Information Professionals, 28 (1), pp. 49-60; Alawneh, A., Hattab, E., An empirical study of sources affecting e-business value creation in jordanian banking services sector (2009) Int.

It is a useful strategy to adjust the student' needs based on their characteristics to make learning more effectively. In this study, we propose the step-function approach for personalization in e-learning. It provides the students with adopting the knowledge-ability factor (Novice, Average, or Good category) that matches with their learning materials levels (Level1, Level2, or Level3). The approach implemented into an e-learning which called SCELE-PDE and used as the experimental group in two stages with different scenarios. In the first, without a step-function approach, but the SCELE-PDE can identify an initial of student's ability to knowledge category. The second stage has used the approach to providing students with personalization in e-Learning to adapt learning material based on a knowledge category. As a result, the step-function approach has successfully to improve the student performance in the learning process during the course. Thus, the approach has shown an increase in the level of students' knowledge. So, it can be used as a guide when designing an e-learning personalization for students to enhance learning and achievement.","E-Learning; Knowledge-Ability Categories; Knowledge-Ability Factor; Personalization; Step-Function",,,,,,,"Simsek, C.O., A comparative analysis of the effects of computer and paper-based personalization on student achievement (2010) Computers & Education, 55 (4), pp. 1524-1531; Khan, F.A., Graf, S., Weippl, E.R., Tjoa, A.M., Implementation of affective states and learning styles tactics in web-based learning management systems (2010) In Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT), IEEE 10th International Conference, pp. 734-735; Bates, E.T., Wiest, L.R., Impact of Personalization of Mathematical Word Problems on Student Performance (2004) Mathematics Educator, 14 (2), pp. 17-26; Chen, L.H., Lai, Y.C., Weng, Y.H., Intelligent e-learning system with personalized misconception diagnose and learning path guidance (2009) In International Conference on Electronic Business, , Macaw; Essalmi, F., Ayed, L.J.B., Jemni, M., Graf, S., A fully personalization strategy of E-learning scenarios (2010) Computers in Human Behavior, 26 (4), pp. 581-591; Yarandi, M., Jahankhani, H., Tawil, A.R.H., A personalized adaptive e-learning approach based on semantic web technology (2013) Webology, 10 (2), pp. 1-14; Sfenrianto, H.Z.A., Suhartanto, H., Selviandro, N., An Approach to Detect Learning Types Based on Triple-Factor In e-Learning Process (2014) Journal of Next Generation Information Technology, 5 (1); Sfenrianto, S.H., Hasibuan, Z.A., A dynamic personalization in e-learning process based on triple-factor architecture Proceedings 8th International Conference on Computing Technology and Information Management (ICCM), 1 (2012), pp. 69-75; Tseng, J.C., Chu, H.C., Hwang, G.J., Tsai, C.C., Development of an adaptive learning system with two sources of personalization information (2008) Computers & Education, 51 (2), pp. 776-786; Milosevic, D., Brkovic, M., Bjekic, D., Designing lesson content in adaptive learning environments (2006) International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET), 1 (2); Chen, C.M., Duh, L.J., Personalized web-based tutoring system based on fuzzy item response theory (2008) Expert Systems with Applications, 34 (4), pp. 2298-2315; Baylari, A., Montazer, G.A., Design a personalized e-learning system based on item response theory and artificial neural network approach (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36 (4), pp. 8013-8021; Salahli, M.A., Özdemir, M., Yasar, C., Concept Based Approach for Adaptive Personalized Course Learning System (2013) International Education Studies, 6 (5), pp. 92-103; Abraham, G., Balasubramanian, V., Saravanaguru, R.K., Adaptive e-learning environment using learning style recognition (2013) International Journal of Evaluation and Research in Education (IJERE), 2 (1), pp. 23-31; El-Bakry, H.M., Saleh, A.A., Adaptive e-learning based on learner's styles (2013) Bulletin of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, 2 (4), pp. 240-251; Hidayat, A., Utomo, V.G., Adaptive Online Module Prototype for Learning Unified Modelling Language (UML) (2016) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 6 (6), pp. 2931-2938; Cahyani, A.D., Basuki, A., Rohman, E.M., Kustiyahningsih, Y., Design an Adaptive E-learning Application Architecture based on IEEE LTSA reference model (2015) TELKOMNIKA Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering, 13 (1), pp. 284-289","Sfenrianto; Master in Information Systems Management, Jln.

For achieving consistency in the inconsistent matrix, researchers usually change the consistent ratio (CR) and the deviation matrix. The pursuit of a minimal CR is important, since this index directly measures the consistency matrix in the AHP. While the deviation matrix should be minimal such that the original opinion of the decision makes is preserved. Ideally, the both value of CR and deviation matrix should be minimal. However, in fact those two objectives will be conflicted if both of them are optimized simultaneously. Therefore, a non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-2 (NSGA-2) for solving the multi-objective problems is considered as an appropriate approach for solving this problem. Six inconsistent AHP matrices are successfully repaired using NSGA-2. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.","AHP; Consistent ratio; Genetic algorithm; NSGA-2","Analytic hierarchy process; Genetic algorithms; Hierarchical systems; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Consistent ratio; Multi objective; Multi-objective problem; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; NSGA-2; Problem solving",,,,,,"Saaty, T.L., (1980) The Analytic Hierarchy Process, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Saaty, T.L., (1984) Decision Making for Leaders, 7. , Esf Editeur; Girsang, A.S., Tsai, C.-W., Yang, C.-S., Ant algorithm for modifying an inconsistent pairwise weighting matrix in an analytic hierarchy process (2014) Neural Comput.

E-commerce became an opportunity for company to increase their selling. Electronic payment (e-payment) was developed to facilitate e-commerce transactions beetwen consumer and seller. In this study, we will investigate consumer's intention to use e-payment. The proposed research model was developed by extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) with culture and perceived security into the model, in order to determine the significance factors that influence acceptance of e-payment technology. Through this model, researchers can have a more accurate explanation of the consumer behavior not only in terms of acceptance of the technology, but other factors considered influential on consumers such as culture and perceived security in the origin country.

However, the overall of factors are not yet fully accommodated in e-learning process. Meanwhile, the results of preliminary study of this research indicated that the existence of these factors as the inherent structure that reflect the relationship among learning styles and motivation to the knowledge ability (Triple-Factor) in elearning process. In order to accommodate the existence of inherent structure, this study explores the learning types based on triple-factor in e-learning process. The approach can be used as the basis for the learning recommendation and personalization in e-learning process. The approach consists of three steps: (1) identifying activity and evaluation of learning outcome, (2) forming Triple-Factor, and (3) detecting learning types based on Triple-Factor. The approach use 36 types of learning which consists of: 18 learning types that has the ability of knowledge good or very good, irrespective of the learning styles and motivation; and 18 learning types that has the ability of knowledge fail or sufficient, irrespective of the learning styles and motivation. Furthermore, the experiment for testing steps was carried by dividing two stages: the first stage did not implement the approach, second stage using learning recommendation and personalization. Result of the testing of these two stages are: step of "" identifying activity and evaluation of learning outcome "" at the second stage, showed that there was a significant increase on the activity of learning (0.007<0.05), and discussion forums (0.006<0.05), meanwhile the evaluation of learning outcomes (0.227>0.05) did not increase significantly. Step of ""forming Triple-Factor"", and "" detecting learning type base on Triple-Factor"" at the second stage showed: learning styles and motivation with the knowledge ability of good and very good increased from 57 to 69 students. In contrast learning styles and motivation with the knowledge ability of fail and sufficient decreased from 61 to 49. The results show that the approach used in the study successfully improve the learning process and its outcomes through learning recommendation and personalization.","E-learning; Knowledge abilities; Learning style; Learning type; Motivation; Triple-factor",,,,,,,"Shaw, R.S., A study of the relationships among learning styles, participation types, and performance in programming language learning supported by online forums (2012) Computers & Education, 58 (1), pp. 111-120; Deborah, P., (2004) ELearning And Motivation 1, 860. , White Paper, ITEC; Hartnett, M., Relationships between online motivation, participation and achievement: More complex than you might think (2012) Journal of Open, Flexible and Distance Learning, 16 (1), pp. 28-41; Sfenrianto, Hasibuan, Z.A., Triple Characteristic Model (TCM) in e-Learning System (2011) IEEE International Conference Science and Information Technology (4th IEEE ICCSIT), , Chengdu China, June; Huitt, W., (1995) A transactional model of the teaching/learning process, , Educational; Sfenrianto, Hasibuan, Z.A., Suhartanto, H., The Influence Factors of Inherent Structure in e-Learning Process (2011) International Journal of e-Education, e-Business, e-Management and e-Learning, 1 (3), pp. 217-222; Graf, S., Kinshuk, L.T., Identifying Learning Styles in Learning Management Systems by Using Indications from Students Behaviour (2008) Proc.

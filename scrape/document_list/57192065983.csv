Using the design thinking process, the writer was finally able to create five new pattern designs involving five steps which were research, analysis, ideation, experimentation, and implementation. The town of Lasem and batik Lasem were chosen because the town held an important role, as the producer of a particular batik in Indonesia that was influenced by Chinese culture. Despite the rich and deep-rooted heritage this particular Batik is now dying along with the younger generation lack of interest in the creation or promotion of the Batik to preserve their culture. This research could be used as a base to create a new style derived from the existing motif that had been analyzed. By interviewing and analyzing four experts from different fields, the writer developed the new and fresh motif design that had both the culture and commercial value and could be accepted by the new millennial generation to achieve preservation batik tulis Lasem. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Critics; Gen millennia; Lasem; New design motif; Preserved batik",,,,,,"The author wishes to acknowledge and thank all IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika journal team that help publish this article.","Basiroen, V.

The city of Lasem, which located on the north coast of Java, plays a vital role as a particular batik producer in Indonesia, which is influenced by Chinese culture. The purpose of this paper is to observe and analyze the entry process of Chinese motifs in Lasem, and the influence of the culture of the center Javanese Keraton on Lasem batik. The research method used is the study of literature, while the primary theory is cultural acculturation. Through this paper, researchers try to find out the process of combining two cultural motifs, in a time phrase in the period 14 to the 19th century. © International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

PCB boards goes through lots of production process from panel cutting to laminating and one single defect in a board will make the entire board become obsolete. With the rise of electronic appliances demand every day, the demand for higher quality components is rising. With the high price tag of commercial AOI, lots of manufacturers are not able to do an automated inspection. This is where Computer Vision can provide an alternative for commercial AOI to assist small scale manufacturers to do an automated inspection. Image Subtraction and Blob detection enable users to easily find numerous visual defects in PCBs especially with a complex method. By dissecting pictures and pointing out the differences on the output image, PCBs can be inspected quickly to find out the defective parts. And thus, this thesis will focus on the basis that a basic image subtraction will be enough to assist Manufacturers in Quality Inspections. © 2017 IEEE.","AOI; Computer Vision; Image Subtraction; OpenCV; PCB","Computer vision; Defects; Information management; Inspection; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Printed circuit manufacture; Automated inspection; Electronic appliances; Image subtraction; OpenCV; Pcb manufacturing; Production process; Quality components; Quality inspection; Printed circuit boards",,,,,"Chauhan, A.P.S., Bhardwaj, S.C., Detection of bare PCB defects by image subtraction method using machine vision (2011) Proceedings of the World Congress on Engineering 201, 2. , July; McIntyre, S., 7 simple & technology driven PCB quality control methods (2017) Syscom Tech USA, , http://www.syscomtechusa.com/simple-technology-driven-pcb-qualitycontrol-methods/, 2 February, [Online]; Anjoran, R., What Is A Quality Inspection?, , https://qualityinspection.org/qc-inspection-china/, [Online]; Moganti, M., Ercal, F., Dagli, C.H., Tsunekawa, S., Automatic PCB inspection algorithms (1996) Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 63 (2), pp. 287-313; Shapiro, L.G., Stockman, G.C., (2001) Computer Vision, , Pearson; Bradski, G., Kaehler, A., (2008) Learning OpenCV, , O'Reilly; Nixon, M., (2008) Feature Extraction & Image Processing, , Academic Press; Russell, S.J., Norvig, P., (2009) Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, , New Jersey: Prentice-Hall; Fisher, R., Perkins, S., Walker, A., Wolfart, E., (2000) Image Arithmetic-Pixel Subtraction, , https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/pixsub.htm, [Online], [Accessed 1 July 2017]",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2nd International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2017","15 November 2017 through 17 November 2017",,134470,,9781538629307,,,"English","Proc.

The main issue in furniture industry is reducing environment pollution and industry waste. The objective of this study is ti apply and implement the green productivity methodology in furniture industry to carry out the environment and waste problems. The green productivity utilizes three tools, specifically material balance, eco-mapping and plant layout. Through the analysis results of material balance, the majority of production wastes were sawdust and a small piece of woods that cannot be exploited again. Instead of being burned, it will be preferable to be accumulated and sold it at the market. With eco-mapping analysis, it can be recognized about which area that produced the most substantial amount of wasted pieces. Hence, the remaining of sawdust will also be collected to be sold. After that, the proposal of the plant layout has been established with the consideration of production scheme and also the distance between all stations will be closer than before. The plant layout chosen is the first of proposed plant layout because it has the shortest production flow distance, which is 49,5m, which can intensify the efficiency of 160% from the original layout. Besides of the reduction industrial waste of this workshop, the company productivity is increased and obtained the additional income as a consequence of invaluable waste at first, to be processed to gain value-added. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Furniture; Green Productivity; Industry Environment","Mapping; Plant layout; Furniture; Furniture industry; Industry environment; Mapping analysis; Production flows; Production schemes; Production wastes; Reducing environment; Productivity",,,,,,"Kemenperin, (2015) Industry Ministry Performance Report; Shirzad, M., Panahi, H.K.S., Dashti, B.B., Rajaeifar, M.A., Aghbashlo, M., Tabatabaei, M., A comprehensive review on electricity generation and GHG emission reduction potentials through anaerobic digestion of agricultural and livestock/slaughterhouse wastes in Iran (2019) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Review, 111, pp. 571-594; Fitton, N., Alexander, P., Arnell, N., Bajzelj, B., Calvin, K., Doelman, J., Gerber, J., Smith, P., The vulnerabilities of agricultural land and food production to future water scarcity (2019) Global Environmental Change, 58; Debbarma, S., Gd, Ransinchung, R.N., Singh, S., Sahdeo, S.K., Utilization of industrial and agricultural wastes for productions of sustainable roller compacted concrete pavement mixes containing reclaimed asphalt pavement aggregates (2020) Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 152; Chandrakumar, C., Gowrynathan, J., Kulatunga, A.K., Sanjeevan, N., Incorporate LEAN and Green Concepts to Enhance the Productivity of Transshipment Terminal Operations (2016) Procedia CIRP, 40, pp. 301-306; Wang, Y., Sun, X., Guo, X., Environmental regulation and green productivity growth: Empirical evidence on the Porter Hypothesis from OECD industrial sectors (2019) Energy Policy, 132, pp. 611-619; (2008) Green Productivity and Green Supply Chain Manual, , APO; (2010) An Approach to Sustainable Development, , APO; Gaspersz, V., Fontana, A., (2011) Systematic Countinuous Improvement and Innovation; Gasperz, V., Vontana, A., (2011) Organizational Excellence: Systematic Continuous Improvement and Innovation; Klausnitzer, A., Lasch, R., Optimal facility layout and material handling network design (2019) Computers & Operations Research, 103, pp. 237-251; Zha, S., Guo, Y., Huang, S., Wang, F., Huang, X., Robust Facility Layout Design under Uncertain Product Demands (2017) Procedia CIRP, 63, pp. 354-359",,,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The intention of measuring KPI is to monitor supplier performance based on purchasing agreement and renewal purchasing decision at the end of the contract. A survey was conducted among network leaders who worked in one leading Indonesian MNO. The company used existing KPI since 2016 without updating both the elements and weights afterward. There are no significant weights differences among existing group KPI (Capability, Performance, Resource and Support) which calculated with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) Method. This study used Quality Function Deployment (QFD) to find new weights and used the AHP method for getting a relative weight of customer requirements as part of QFD’s component. The result shows group KPI between existing and study are different significantly for both element ranking and weight, also the new weight better reflects the current situation. The process of this study could be proposed to another telecommunication firm in order to evaluate their supplier’s KPI. The proposed method enables the decision-maker can easily assign his priority degrees and calculate the original KPI indices for their equipment supplier.

Data was taken by distributing questionnaires using the Likert scale to 126 offshore oil and gas workers. The combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches was used in this study. The research data were analyzed by descriptive analysis method and validated using SPSS statistical software ver.16 to ensure the research data had good validity, reliability and accuracy. The results of the study show that the main causes of fatal work accidents in the offshore oil and gas industry are human errors, conditions of workers who are not fit and lack of knowledge. The type of human error that causes it is disobedience, lack of rest or fatigue, and not concentration. Meanwhile, the most ergonomically dangerous type of activity is working at height, lifting, and working in a confined space. From this study it can also be concluded that human factors have a greater influence compared to the effect of ergonomic factors. Based on the results of these studies, it was designed a simple tool to test the level of fitness both physically and mentally from workers in the offshore oil and gas industry to prevent fatal work accidents. © IAEME Publication","Ergonomic; Fatal Work Accident; Human Factors; Offshore; Prevention",,,,,,,"Besnard, D., Hollnagel, E., I want to believe: Some myths about the management of industrial safety (2014) Cogn Tech Work, 16, pp. 13-23; Jahangiri, M., Hoboubi, N., Rostamabadi, A., Keshavarzi, S., Hosseini, A.A., Human error analysis in a permit to work system: A case study in a chemical plant (2016) Safety and Health at Work, 7, pp. 06-11; Bridges, W., Tew, R., Human factors elements missing from process safety management (PSM) (2010) Process Improvement Institute, 6th Global Congress on Process Safety and The 44th Annual Loss Prevention Symposium, pp. 01-24; (2010) Elementary Statistic, , Almelda & Sarte Quezon City: Diliman; Kothari, (2014) Research Methodology (Methods and Techniques), , India: New Age International Publisher; Boone, H.N., Boone, D.A., Analyzing Likert data (2012) Journal of Extensions, 50 (2), pp. 01-05; Pramesti, G., (2014) Kupas Tuntas Data Penelitian Dengan SPSS 22, , Jakarta: PT Elex Media Komputindo; Faktor dan Penjadwalan Shift Kerja (2008) Teknoin, 13 (2), pp. 11-12. , Maurits & Widodo; Sutalaksana, (1979) Teknik Tata Cara Kerja, , Bandung: Depertemen Teknik Industri ITB; Megiso, T.D., Passengers ergonomics evaluation of locally modified intercity buses Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (2017) International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Technology, 8 (1), pp. 70-80",,,,"IAEME Publication",,,,,09766340,,,,"English","Int.

The methods involved in this paper include having a survey on the current therapy facility, determine problem statement based on the therapy facility’s condition, develop measurement tools using questionnaires, measurements of the rooms’ sound level, brightness and temperature as well as anthropometric measurements for the kids and the therapists, sampling, collect measurement data and analyze the data, and develop improvements on the therapy facility based on problems/issues faced by the kids and their therapists. Based on the results from the measurements, the therapy facility should have improved soundproofing (around 27-32%), both natural (91%) and artificial lighting (77%) due to the lighting level far from the required minimal brightness of 250 Lux, minimal amount of stimuli especially stimuli related to sound (80.95%), texture (19.05%) and light (14.29%) in order to keep the kids focused, more ergonomic room layout for better comfort for the kids and their therapists as well as more ergonomic seats (9%) and tables (33%). © IAEME Publication.","Autism; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Ergonomics; Ergonomics on Autism Therapy; Ergonomics on Autistic People",,,,,,,"(2015) Acoustics of Schools: A Design Guide, , Acoustics & Noise Consultants; Dewi, B., (2015) FisiologiKerja, , http://epitychiaergonomos.blogspot.com/2016/05/fisiologi-kerja-fisiologimerupakan-ilmu.html?m=1; Dillard, B.G., Frazier Schwager, T., Ergonomic equipment investments: Benefits to apparel manufacturers (1997) International Journal of Clothing Science and Technology, 9 (4), pp. 285-300; Giacolini, L., Marti, P., Iacono, I., Game of stimuli (2007) Proceedings of The European Conference on Cognitive Ergonomics 2015 - ECCE '15; Kathiravan, S., Gunarani, G.I., Ergonomic Performance Assessment (EPA) using RULA and REBA for Residential Construction in Tamil Nadu (2018) International Journal of Civil Engineering and Technology, 9 (4), pp. 836-843; (2013) Ergonomics & Human Factors at Work: A Brief Guide, , Health & Safety Executive; Kanakri, S.M.F., (2014) The Impact of Acoustical Environmental Design of Children with Autism; McAllister, K., (2014) The ASD Friendly Classroom-Design Complexity, Challenge and Characteristics; Rakesh, G.K., Roy, S.C., Ergonomic investigation and their effect on productivity of micro, small & medium industry of Jharkhand state (2014) International Journal of Industrial Engineering Research and Development (IJIERD), 5 (3), pp. 01-12. , May June; Meyer, A., Fourie, I., Collaborative information seeking environments benefiting from holistic ergonomics (2015) Library Hi Tech, 33 (3), pp. 439-459. , https://doi.org/10.1108/LHT-06-2015-0062; Christy, V., Ergonomics and employee engagement (2019) International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Technology, 10 (2), pp. 105-109; Nkakini, S.O., Vurasi, N.M., Ergonomic evaluation of lawn mower operation for comfort in rivers state, Nigeria (2015) International Journal of Advanced Research in Engineering and Technology, 6 (7), pp. 43-51; Megiso, T.D., Passengers ergonomics evaluation of locally modified intercity buses Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (2017) International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Technology, 8 (1), pp. 70-80; Nazri, N.A., Ismail, Z., Educational building facilities for children with autism in Malaysia (2016) Jurnal Teknologi, 78 (5-2); (2000) Ergonomics: The Study of Work, , OSHA 3125, US Department of Labor Occupational Safety & Health Administration; How Noise Affects Learning, , https://www.soundproofcow.com/soundproof-a-space-restaurant-office/classroomsoundproofing/; Salunke, P., Kallurkar, S., Nemade, Identifying anthropometric parameters considered for the improvement in ergonomic design of classroom furniture (2015) International Journal of Industrial Engineering Research and Development, 6 (1), pp. 01-13; Turner, D., (2017) Color and Autism, , http://enduratex.blogspot.com/2017/04/color-andautism.html",,,,"IAEME Publication",,,,,09766340,,,,"English","Int.

The objective of this research is to analyze the sandwich model of natural fiber composite to be introduced in metal matrix alloys for engineering application purposes. The sandwich model is the hybrid material combined with layers aluminum LM6 and kenaf composite laminated. Overall thickness for each design is 35mm. For the sandwich design, each layer of LM6 is 10mm thickness and each layer of kenaf-polyester composites is 15mm to make it 3 layers with 35mm thickness. The dimensions for both models are referring based on the requirement of ASTM C393, Standard Test Method for Flexural Properties of Sandwich Construction. Based on the simulation results, it is feasible to use the sandwich model of LM6 with kenaf-polyester composite. In addition, this simulation result strongly supports the potential for this hybrid laminate of LM6 and kenaf-polyester composite as a substitute for solid LM6, reducing the usage of LM6 substance and introducing natural fiber element into engineering application. © 2019 IAEME Publication.","Aluminum LM6; Composite; Kenaf fiber; Model; Sandwich design",,,,,"12/AKM/PNT/2019","This work is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Pengembangan Model Perpindahan Panas untuk Bahan Material Termaju” or “Development of Heat Transfer Model for Advanced Material” with contract number: 12/AKM/PNT/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","Imielińska, K., Guillaumat, L., Wojtyra, R., Castaings, M., Effects of manufacturing and face/core bonding on impact damage in glass/polyester-PVC foam core sandwich panels (2008) Composites Part B: Engineering, 39 (6), pp. 1034-1041; Kim, K.J., Kim, D., Choi, S.H., Chung, K., Shin, K.S., Barlat, F., Oh, K.H., Youn, J.R., Formability of AA5182/polypropylene/AA5182 sandwich sheets (2003) Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 139, pp. 1-7; Tan, C.Y., Hazizan, M.A., Impact response of fiber metal laminate sandwich composite structure with polypropylene honeycomb core (2012) Composites: Part B, 43, pp. 1433-1438; Asli, G., (2009) Joining and Interfacial Properties of Aluminum/Glass Fiber Reinforced Polypropylene Sandwich Composites, , Master thesis, Izmir Institute of Technology; Akil, H.M., Zamri, M.H., Performance of natural fiber composites under dynamic loading (2014) Natural Fiber Composites: Materials, Processes and Applications, pp. 323-344; Rijswijk, K.V., Brouwer, W.D., Beukers, A., (2001) Application of Natural Fiber Composites in the Development of Rural Societies, , Structures and Materials Laboratory, Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Delft University of Technology; Akil, H.M., Omar, M.F., Mazuki, A.A.M., Safiee, S., Ishak, Z.A.M., Abu Bakar, A., Kenaf fiber reinforced composites: A review (2011) Materials and Design Journal, 32, pp. 4107-4121; Nair, A.B., Joseph, R., Eco-friendly bio-composites using natural rubber (NR) matrices and natural fiber reinforcements (2014) Chemistry, Manufacture and Applications of Natural Rubber, pp. 249-283; Al-Madeed, M.A., Labidi, S., Recycled polymers in natural fiber-reinforced polymer composites (2014) Natural Fiber Composites: Materials, Processes and Applications, pp. 103-114; Dai, D., Fan, M., Wood fibers as reinforcements in natural fiber composites: Structure, properties, processing and applications (2014) Natural Fiber Composites: Materials, Processes and Applications, pp. 3-65; Leong, Y.W., Thitithanasarn, Y.K., Hamada, H., Compression and injection molding techniques for natural fiber composites (2014) Natural Fiber Composites: Materials, Processes and Applications, pp. 216-232; Narendiranath Babu, T., Shivasai, B., Mahesh, V., Reddy, P., Design and analysis of coconut fiber reinforced polyester composite leaf-spring (2017) International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Technology, 8 (6), pp. 544-552; Chokshi, S., Gohil, P., Effect of strain rate on tensile strength of natural fiber reinforced polyester composites (2018) International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Technology, 9 (10), pp. 861-869; Goutham, B., Karunakar, C.H., Prashanth, A., Vamshi, T., Development and evaluation of some of the mechanical properties of Kenaf/Polyester cellulose composites (2014) International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Technology (IJMET), 5 (9), pp. 259-265. , September",,,,"IAEME Publication",,,,,09766480,,,,"English","Int.

In order to reduce the production total cost, e-procurement is introduced. E-procurement means of reducing cost is by shortening cycle time and create a simpler procurement process. The aim of this research is to develop a vendor management and e-procurement system using the Android platform. The developed system is hoped to be able to even shorten the cycle time, ease vendor selection and provide a more flexible and convenience procurement process. Through data measurement and documentation review, the developed system was tested against these three parameters for their validity.

This study was conducted at the Jakarta Toll Gate namely Semanggi I, Semanggi II and Halim. Data is obtained from observations when the driver pays the cost of the expressway at the toll gate. This study shows a reaction time for the payment of expressway costs, which are influenced by types of motorized vehicles such as sedans, jeeps, buses, and trucks. The results show that the reaction time of driver when before and after paying, the longest toll road costs is 48 seconds and the shortest is 1 second. Reaction time for the payment of expressway costs could shorten the travel time, with an average reaction time of 6.04 seconds on vehicles. The number of vehicles crossing the toll gate on 24 hours from the three Toll Gates amount 17.256 vehicles. As a result, Most of vehicle traffic contributed by the behavior of driver at the Toll Gate. © 2019 IAEME Publication.","Driver; Jakarta; Reaction time; Toll gate; Vehicles",,,,,,,"Green, M., Perception-reaction time: Is olson (and sivak) all you need to know?

The workers also can get physical injury risk such as Musculoskeletal Disorder (MSDs). To reduce the risk, it is necessary to analyze the work task through risk assessment to observe the posture during using the equipment such as rig up the Pressure Control Equipment (PCE) to determine the level of risk for each task, and the cumulative risk for each work cycle. This study uses the Postural Ergonomic Risk Assessment (PERA) method to analyze and measuring cyclic assembly work. We set the risk criteria for activity classification (A) into posture, duration, and force which divided into three groups (A<4 = Low risk, 4≤A≤ 7 = Possible risk, A≥7 = High risk). Time duration and stressed posture provide high risk exposure, whereas the workers manually operate and install the component and spare parts can lead to medium and low risk exposures. We found that the high potential risks to cause harm are when the workers operate Tree Adaptor Installation and BOP Installation. Whereas, the Making up Lubricator connection and PCE Secure Line Installation provide medium and low risk exposures, respectively. Our study can be guidance on the steps of prioritization and intervention to reduce the musculoskeletal risks. © IAEME Publication.","Musculoskeletal disorder; PCE; PERA; Risk analysis; Workspace design",,,,,,,"Arjmand, N., Amini, M., Adi, A.S., Plamondon, A., Parnianpour, M., Revised NIOSH lifting equation may generate spine loads exceeding recommended limits (2015) International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, pp. 1-8;

The challenge to set a safety stock for MRO materials is uncertainty of demand and lead time especially in industry where the operation plant is far away from materials manufacturer. The correlation is presented between maintenance activities and inventory control strategy to provide acceptable service level through combined the equipment and material criticality with optimum inventory safety stock level by linked the acceptable downtime of equipment with lead time of ordering materials. The result shows the criticality material and equipment is increased the assurance of inventory control to set a service level and incorporated in the safety stock calculation. The contribution of this paper is to find an alternative solution by approaching the criticality of material and equipment. In addition, by using this approach the optimization for maintenance, reliability and operation materials can be determined.

One of the main contributors of human errors is fatigue, and fatigue occurred either due to insufficient sleep or disruptions in normal sleep cycle. Ultimately, the shift workers has high tendency to experiences fatigue due to shift rotation. Petrochemical, oil and gas plant adopted shift work schedule to ensure the continuity and to optimize the utilization of workforce. It is critical to analyse the relationship between fatigue and human errors to prevent accident/incident at workplace. A combination of quantitative and qualitative research was conducted using questionnaires for collecting primary data and a survey of literature related to fatigue and human errors for collecting the secondary data. The study was carried out to investigate the possible types of human errors and their causes that lead to incident/accident in petrochemical, oil and gas plant's operation and to evaluate the relationship between fatigue and human errors. Sample was taken from shift worker of operation team that consist of field operators, DCS operators and shift controllers. The study results demonstrated that there is a clear link between fatigue and human errors, human errors prevention done by preventing the fatigue. There are four types of human errors were investigated (lapses, slips, mistakes, and procedure violation). Fatigue can be prevented by modifying the working hours, reducing working hours, improving the working environments (lighting, display, noise, colour similarity, appearance similarity), simplifying the tasks, proper ratio between manpower and workload. The responsibility to manage fatigue should be taken by both employers and employees. © IEOM Society International.","Fatigue; Human error; Oil and gas plants; Petrochemical; Shift work",,,,,,,"Besnard, D., Hollnagel, E., I want to believe: some myths about the management of industrial safety (2014) Cogn Tech Work, 16, pp. 13-23. , [Electronic version] [2017, Jan 30]; Bridges, W., Tew, R., Human Factors Elements Missing from Process Safety Management (PSM (2010) Process Improvement Institute, 6th Global Congress on Process Safety and the 44th Annual Loss Prevention Symposium, pp. 01-24; Caruso, C.C., Negative Impacts of Shiftwork and Long Work Hours (2014) Rehabil Nurs, 39 (1), pp. 16-25. , [2017, Jul 10]; Costa, G., Introduction to Problems of Shift Work (2016) Social and Family Issues in Shift Work and Non Standard Working Hours, , Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

Cellroom has a very large number of valves that vary greatly in terms of model, service and size but in one place that is not wide so that the valve location is often close together sometimes even coincide. The objective of this research is to analysis work posture using RULA method on operator cellroon electrolyser. Valve layout that is difficult to reach and heavy rotation to operate also sometimes the operator must squat and bend when operating most of the valves. The results shows, RULA identified the high risk in performing job task in cellroom electrolyser. A survey method developed for the usefulness of ergonomic investigations in the workplace, in which occupational upper body muscle disease is identified. This tool does not require special equipment in providing posture measurements of the neck, back, arms and upper body as the function of the muscles and the external burden of the body. As a result, several design and tools were proposed to increase the operator's performance in cellroom electrolyser. © IEOM Society International.","Fatigue; Human error; Oil and gas plants; Petrochemical; Shift work",,,,,,,"Kelly, C., (2005) The beauty of fit: Proportion and anthropometry in chair design, , Georgia Institute and Technology; Brian, M.K., (2005) Macroergonomics analysis and design of work systems.

The target group of this proposed helmet is children from 2-6 years old. The scoring concept was used to select the proposed design. It reuses the conventional kid helmet structure in the market by making sure the re-processing of broken swimming tubing material. The unique characteristic that tube has is the ability to inflate and in this paper, is called as secondary padding that located in the inner shell of a proposed helmet. A finite element analysis using SolidWorks software was conducted for evaluating the static analysis of secondary padding which includes stress, displacement, and strain. The results show that the secondary padding using swimming tube design is safe to use with the condition of 8.357e6 N/m2 maximum von Mises stress with a safety factor of 1.523. © Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology.","Child helmet;

Determining the appropriate teaching and learning tool is an essential decision in education system. There are many teaching and learning tools have been developed to assist lecturers for teaching and delivering materials in the class. The appropriate use of tools is important that allows interaction between lecturers and students. Therefore, the appropriate tool in teaching and learning must be determined and the method than can be employed is analytical hierarchy process (AHP). In order to illustrate the application of AHP, there are 5 main factors and 15 sub-factors that determine the decision of tools. In this study, there were 4 decision options were considered namely u-learn system, BlogSpot, Facebook and email.

One of the supply chain activities is supplier selection. Supplier selection has involved in maintaining the smoothness of process production, the dependency between suppliers has becomes a serious concern for company. This study focuses on the supplier selection problem to obtain the best supplier for Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) Company. The criteria of supplier selections for (FMCG) company were introduced. The criteria in supplier evaluations are limited to quality, price, payment term, quantity accuracy, on time accuracy, response of supplier, flexibility of supplier and completeness of document. The weights of importance level for each criteria is processed by using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach. In obtaining information on supplier overall performance, the weights of importance level is multiplied with actual supplier score. As the result, the score of overall supplier performance could help decision maker in deciding the amount of allocation order that should be distributed for each supplier. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Analytic hierarchy process; Fast moving consumer goods (FCMG); Order allocation; Supplier selection; Supply chain management",,,,,,,"Galankashi, M.R., Helmi, S.A., Supplier selection in automobile industry: A mixed balanced scorecard-fuzzy AHP approach (2016) Alexandria Engineering Journal, 55 (1), pp. 93-100; Kilincci, O., Onal, S.A., Fuzzy AHP approach for supplier selection in a washing machine company (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 38 (8), pp. 9656-9664; Chang, B., Chang, C.-W., Fuzzy DEMATEL method for developing supplier selection criteria (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 38 (3), pp. 1850-1858; Mendoza, A., Ventura, J.A., Analytical models for supplier selection and order quantity allocation (2012) Applied Mathematical Modelling, 36 (8), pp. 3826-3836; Nazari-Shirkouhi, S., Shakouri, H., Supplier selection and order allocation problem using a two-phase fuzzy multi-objective programming (2012) Applied Mathematical Modelling, 37 (22), pp. 1-16; Firouz, M., Burchu, B., An integrated supplier selection and inventory problem with multi-sourcing and lateral transshipments (2016) The International Journal of Management Science, pp. 1-43; Singh, A., Supplier evaluation and demand allocation among suppliers (2014) Journal of Purchasing & Supply Management, 20 (3), pp. 6-9; Raoa, C., Xiao, X., Compound Mechanism Design of Supplier Selection Based on Multi-attribute Auction and Risk Management of Supply Chain (2016) Computers & Industria lEngineering, 105, pp. 1-31; Sodenkamp, M.A., Tavana, M., Modeling synergies in multi-criteria supplier selection and order allocation: An application to commodity trading (2016) European Journal of Operational Research, 254 (3), pp. 1-16; Rezaei, J., Fahim, P.B.M., Supplier selection in the airline retail industry using a funnel methodology: Conjunctive screening method and fuzzy AHP (2014) Expert Systems with Applications, 48 (18), pp. 1-42; Luo, X., Wu, C., Supplier selection in agile supply chains: An information-processing model and a illustration (2009) Journal of Purchasing & Supply Management, 15 (4), pp. 249-262; Chaffey, D., (2009) E-Business and E-Commerce Management Strategy, Implementation and Practice, , Harlow: Prentice Hall; Sheth, J.N., Sharma, A., Why integrating purchasing with marketing is both inevitable and beneficial (2009) Industrial Marketing Management, 38 (8), pp. 865-871; Aissaoui, N., Haouari, M., Supplier selection and order lot sizing modeling: A review (2007) Computers and Operations Research, 34 (12), pp. 3516-3540. , (in press); Erdem, A.S., Gocen, E., Development of a decision support system for supplier evaluation and order allocation (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 39 (5), pp. 4927-4937; De Boer, L., Labro, E., A review of methods supporting supplier selection (2001) European Journal of Purchasing & Supply Management, 7 (2), pp. 75-89; Demirtas, E.A., Ustun, O., Analytic network process and multi-period goal programming integration in purchasing decisions (2009) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 56 (2), pp. 677-690; Tramarico, C.L., Analytic Hierarchy Process and Supply Chain Management: A Bibliometric Study, Information Technology and Quantitative Management (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 55, pp. 441-450. , Brazil; Chan, F.T.S., Kumar, N., Global supplier selection: a fuzzy-AHP approach (2008) International Journal of Production Research, 46 (14), pp. 3825-3857; Omkarprasad, S., Vaidya, S.K., Analytic hierarchy process: An overview of applications (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, (169), pp. 1-29; Sipahi, S., Timor, M., The analytic hierarchy process and analytic network process: an overview of applications (2010) Management Decision, 48 (5), pp. 775-808; Ishizaka, A., Nemery, P., (2013) Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis: methods and software, , John Wiley & Sons Ltd; Levary, R.R., Using the analytic hierarchy process to rank foreign suppliers based on supply risks (2008) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 55 (2), pp. 535-542; Ho, W., Xu, X., Multi-criteria decision making approaches for supplier evaluation and selection: A literature review (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 202 (1), pp. 16-24","Sahroni, T.R.; Master in Industrial Engineering, Jl.

Resistance spot welding is a fast, easily automated and easily maintained process with high productivity. This paper was performed to investigate the design parameters of sheet metal welded joint based on transient thermal condition. The transient thermal condition of the sheet metal was analyzed and the factor of safety was proposed at the end of the project. The design parameters included were the number of spot welding, dimension, material and thickness of sheet metal. Aluminum 5182-H19 was used as a base material to study the mechanical properties and thermal behavior. The transient thermal analysis was conducted on aluminum alloy 5182-H19 sheet metal with dimension 120mm×60mm, thickness 1mm to 6mm and number of spot weld two to five. Suitable combination of thickness of sheet metal with number of spot weld is proposed after the simulation and analysis. The CAD model and analysis of sheet metal was performed by using ANSYS software. The results of both the thermal analysis were heat flux, reaction probe and factor of safety. Scoring concept was provided to determine the number of spot weld for each thickness of the sheet metal. It is found that two number of spot weld was suitable for thickness of 1mm, 2mm, 4mm, and 6mm.

The comparison of these three types of sand mould for surface roughness are analysed by using portable surface roughness tester. Technique of mixing the natural fibre and silica sand was presented. The mould was prepared using similar volume of natural fibre between kenaf fibre and empty fruit bunch fibre. The ratio of natural fibre for two type of sand fibre mould using 100 g of natural fibre and 1 kg of silica sand. The third sand mould using only 3.3 kg of silica sand without mixed with natural fibre. Total weight of three type of sand mould is 3.3 kg. Besides, this investigation was employed with 3 mm to 5 mm length range of natural fibre and mixture mutually with silica sand. The addition of natural fibre in the sand casting mould was significantly absorbing the heat of molten metal to the surrounding. As a result, the utilization of kenaf fibre and EFB fibre for sand mould were significant on improving the surface roughness of casted LM6 material. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Sand casting; Sand fibre mould; Surface roughness of LM6","Empty fruit bunches; Sand castings; Sand moulds; Fruits; Industrial engineering; Kenaf fibers; Liquid metals; Mixtures; Molds; Natural fibers; Surface roughness; Silica sand",,,,,,"Beddoes, J., Bibby, J., (2003) Principles of Metal Manufacturing Process, , Butterworth Heinemann, Canada; Wanlong, W., Henry, W., James, G., (2010) Rapid Tooling Guidelines For Sand Casting, , New York; Arib, R.M.N., Sapuan, S.M., Ahmad, M.M.H.M., Paridah, M.T., Khairul Zaman, H.M.D., Mechanical properties of pineapple leaf fibre reinforced polypropylene composites (2006) Materials & Design, 27, pp. 304-391; Khairiah, B., Khairul, A.M.A., Biocomposites from oil palm resources (2006) Journal of Oil Palm Research.

The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTEs) of casted aluminium silicon carbide fibre reinforced material was significantly influenced by the thermal stresses and interfaces between matrix and fibres. The thermal expansion behaviour of the casted aluminium silicon carbide fibre reinforced composite relies on the thermal expansion of the fibres, and influenced by the onset of interfacial strength and residual stress state. The validation shows a good agreement with surface roughness. In order to determine the performance of the model, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) was presented by using SPSS. The performance of casting quality model shows the correlation at the high level of accuracy 99.9% with confidence level of 95% between the experiment and the model.

The objective of this research is to study the feasibility of natural fibre to introduce in the metal matrix composites for sand casting process. LM6 is the core material used in this research while natural fibre used as composite materials as well as to remain the hardness of the materials. The preparation of natural fibre composites was proposed to introduce in metal matrix composite material. Empty Fruit Bunch (EFB) and kenaf fibre were used in the experimental work. Natural fibre is reinforced in the LM6 material by using metal casting process with open mould technique. LM6 material was melted using induction furnace which required 650°C for melting point. The structure and composition of the composite materials is determined using EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray) to show that fibres are absent on the surface of LM6. The microstructure of casted natural fibre-LM6 composites was presented using Zeiss Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with an accelerating voltage of 15kV.

The specimen aluminum mold plate was made using a laser cutting machine. Rice husk was selected for introduction to the tin-lead alloy composite. Sand casting techniques and a hot press molding machine were used to produce the specimen. Three types of testing were used in these studies: tensile test, flexural test and hardness test. A new technique for preparing a natural fiber and metal matrix composite material using a manual mixer has been developed to stir the mixture uniformly during the solidification phase. The SiC particulate and rice husk as a natural fiber were introduced to the tin-lead alloy for engineering applications to maintain the hardness of the material. It was found that the mechanical properties of the fabricated composites increased through reinforcement with SiC and rice husk in the material matrix of Sn, particularly for flexural and hardness properties. However, the result shows the tensile strength not significantly improved as the tensile strength for the composite is lower than that for tin-lead alloy (60-40). The experiment also obtained better performance for the tensile modulus and flexural modulus. There is potential to use rice husk in Sn composite material for engineering applications. © Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Malaysia.","Composite material; Engineering application; Feasibility study; Natural fiber",,,,,,,"Adebisi, A.A., Maleque, M.A., Rahman, M.M., Metal matrix composite brake rotor: Historical development and product life cycle analysis (2011) International Journal of Automotive and Mechanical Engineering, 4, pp. 471-480;

The machining parameters such as pulse-on time, pulse-off time and peak current were selected to find the responses on the material characteristics such as material removal rate (MRR), electrode wear rate (EWR) and surface roughness (Ra). Brass with diameter of 10mm was chosen as an electrode. Orthogonal array of Taguchi method was used to develop experimental matrix and to optimize the MRR, EWR and Ra. It is found that the current is the most significantly affected the MRR, EWR and Ra while pulse on time, pulse off time and voltage are less significant factor that affected the responses. Percentage optimum value of MRR increases to 3.99%, however EWR and Ra reduce to 3.10% and 2.48% respectively.

The effect of maleic anhydride and dicumyl peroxide percentage on the grafting efficiency of maleic anhydride onto ethylene-propylene copolymer chains was carried out through a two-level factorial experimental design using Design Expert 6.0.5 software. The maleic anhydride and dicumyl peroxide content were varied, in the range of 1-5 and 01-03 phr, respectively. The grafting parameters were fixed at a temperature of 180°C and rotor speed of 60 rev min1 for 5 minutes. The grafting efficiency was determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis based on cumulative absorbance of anhydrides' characteristic peaks and supported by differential scanning calorimetry and field emission scanning electron microscopy analyses. The grafting was highly influenced by maleic anhydride and dicumyl peroxide content. The optimum functionalisation was achieved at 5 phr maleic anhydride and 03 phr peroxide addition. © W. S.

The study is carried out in a leading palm oil factory in Malaysia. At present solvent extraction plant are facing problem of high hexane loss, average 9.5 litre/metric ton (ltr/mt). To reduce the hexane loss, critical investigations were performed to improve the heat transfer between hexane vapour and water condenser shell and tube. Preliminary investigations reveal that 21% of the hexane is being loss during plant operation. The present redesigned heat exchanger is successfully reduced the hexane loss from 9.5% ltr/mt to 7.5ltr/mt per day of the same operating plant which saves about RM904, 800 per annum for the industry. Ultimately, the outcome of this study gives a great economic impact to the industry by reducing the production cost leading into the reduction of oil price for the nation. In addition it is found that not only the monetary impact is benefited, but, the release of hexane to atmospheric also reduced to ensure safe healthy life of people surrounding the plant. © August 2013 IJENS.","Heat exchanger design; Hexane; Hexane saving; Palm kernel oil; Palm oil extraction; Solvent extraction plant",,,,,,,"(2010) Soy Protein And Chemical Solvents In Nutrition Bars And Meat Alternatives, , Natural Versus Organic (NVO) Hexane Report, Cornucopia Institute; Creaser, C., Welch, J., Bishop, K., N-Hexane in Petroleum Ether Fractions (1983) Ann Occup Hyg, 27 (2), pp. 229-230; Jorgensen, N.K., Chor, K.H., n-Hexane and its toxicologic effects: A review (1981) Stand J Work Environ Health, 7, pp. 157-68; Takeuchi, Y., Hisanaga, N., Ono, Y., Modification of metabolism and neurotoxicity of hexane by co-exposure of toluene (1993) International Archives Occupational, 65 (1), pp. 227-230; Altenkirch, H., Wagner, H.M., Stoltenburg, G., Nervous System Responses Of Rats To Subchronic Inhalation Of N-Hexane And N-Hexane Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone Mixture (1982) Journal of Neurol Science, 57, pp. 209-219; Hai, T.C., The Palm Oil Industry in Malaysia: From Seed to Frying Pan (2002), Prepared for WWF Switzerland; Thin, K.C., Khaing, M.M., Aye, K.M., Design and Performance Analysis of Centrifugal Pump (2008) World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, 46, pp. 422-429","Sivaraos; Faculty of Manufacturing Engineering, , 76100, Durian Tunggal, Melaka, Malaysia; email: sivarao@utem.edu.my",,,,,,,,22272771,,,,"English","Int.

Being the earliest machining process, lathing operation captures 60 % of the total machining processes in most metal cutting industries. This paper reviews the literature related to the available technological solutions for non-contact laser lathing process. It also aims to establish a novel methodology to propose a hybrid non-contact lathing operation using a flatbed CO2 laser cutting machine.

Thermal expansion in the casting process is one of the most important parameters that influence the casting quality. The thermal expansion model for casted aluminium silicon carbide is developed by the squeeze casting method. A model of numbers evolved for the prediction of the unidirectional fibre and matrix reinforced composites was presented. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTEs) of aluminium silicon carbide fibres reinforced material was significantly influenced by the thermal stresses and interfaces between matrix and fibres. The thermal expansion behaviour of the casted aluminium silicon carbide fibres reinforced composite relies on the thermal expansion of the fibres, and influenced by the onset of interfacial strength and residual stress state. The validation shows a good agreement among the model and experimental result of LM6 alloys silicon reinforces. As the result, the thermal expansion model for casted aluminium silicon carbide could predict the surface roughness of the casting product. © 2013 The Authors.

EM-Lock continuously consumes electricity (almost 24 hours) let it to be when the door is in the locked or unlocked conditions, besides requiring a backup battery in case of power failure to avoid the lock from malfunction. It is also pretty much easier to be electrically or mechanically hacked with a little bit of skill in breaking in. Therefore, Super Energy Saving Locking System (SES-Lock) was critically engineered, in such a way that it does not at all consume power supply when the door is in the locked or unlocked conditions, which enabled the power saving almost up to 95% compared to EM lock of the same capacity. The system was also intelligently innovated in which no back-up battery is required for SES-Lock during a power failure, where the system can still remain locked as usual and can be easily opened using embedded fail safe and fail secure administrative key operated mechanically. SES-Lock is fully compatible and can be integrated with the common door access control system regardless of its type namely key pad, card swipe, or biometric. Its body structure was designed with Al alloy 6061- T6 material to withstand if not same for better mechanical and electrical performance compared to EM-Lock. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Electromechanical lock; Energy saving lock; Finite element analysis; Ses- lock; Stress analysis",,,,,,,"Sivarao, A.A., Taufik, Y., Ian, H., Robert, K.M., Tin, S.L., Critical Review of Electro-Mechanical Door Locking System and Proposal Towards Development of Innovative Super Energy Saving Door Locking System (2012) International Journal of Engineering and Innovative Technology (IJEIT), 2 (5), pp. 201-207; Ebelco, (2013) Access Control System, , http://www/ebelco.com, Retrieved from; Mathers, R.A., Sittnick, R.A., (1988) Electromagnetic door lock system, , U.S. Patent, 4763937 A; Chang, J., (2009) Magnetic Lock Means with Auxiliary Mechanical Locking or Resistance Means, , U.S. Patent, 20090302619 A1; Phillips, B., (2005) The Complete Book of Locks and Locksmithing, , (6th edition, McGraw-Hill,); (2013) Pricing and Tariff, , http://www.tnb.com.my/residential/pricing-and-tariff.html, Tenaga Nasional Berhad, Retrieved from; Ashby, M.F., (2011) Material Selection in Mechanical Design, , (4th edition, Elsevier Ltd.); Beer, F.P., Russell Johnston Jr., E., (2006) Mechanics of Materials, , (4th edition, McGraw-Hill, Inc.); Tarighi, J., Mohtasebi, S.S., Alimardani, R., Static and dynamic analysis of front axle housing of tractor using finite element methods (2011) Australian Journal of Agricultural Engineering (AJAE), 2 (2), pp. 45-49; Munir, F.A., Azmi, M.I.M., Salim, M.A., Zin, M.R.M., Hassan, M.Z., Preliminary design of carbon composite facing for dry clutch disc of mini agricultural tractor (2011) International Review of Mechanical Engineering (IREME), 5 (4), pp. 577-580; Kurowski, P.M., (2012) Engineering Analysis with SolidWorks Simulation 2012, , (Stephen Schroff); Ismail, A.E., Ariffin, A.K., Abdullah, S., Ghazali, M.J., Effect of crack faces opening mechanisms on the combined stress intensity factors under bending and torsion moments (2011) International Review on Modelling and Simulations (IREMOS), 4 (6), pp. 3232-3238; Prabhakaran, S., Ramachandran, S., Comparison of contact stress of helical gear for steel C45 with AGMA standard and FEA model (2013) International Review of Mechanical Engineering (IREME), 7 (5), pp. 828-831",,,,"Praise Worthy Prize",,,,,19708734,,,,"English","Int.

The objective of this paper is to determined the maximum stress and displacement on human lumbar by using computer aided engineering (CAE) software called Msc. Patran/Nastran. The 3D modeling of the lumbar spine from transferring data points of 3D scanner is reconstructed. The stress used for lifting loads from 20 to 60 kg is ranging between 2.52 to 74.1 MPa. The results showed that the end plate at 5th lumbar is experiencing the maximum stress development. This analysis is relevant to the industries especially manufacturing sector in order to provide a direction for ergonomists in the modification of jobs for workers who perform manual lifting. In order to gain a higher precision, it is suggested in the future that the lumbar spine is to be built based directly on a loaded CT scan and biodynamic loading situation with vibration and impact. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.","Human finite element analysis; Lumbar spine model; Maximum stress (Von Mises)",,,,,,,"Kingma, I., Bosch, T., Bruins, L., van Dieën, J.H., Foot Positioning Instruction, Initial Vertical Load Position and Lifting Technique: Effects on Low Back Loading (2004) Ergonomics, 47 (13), pp. 1365-1385; Kingma, I., Faber, G.S., van Dieën, J.H., How to Lift A Box That is Too Large to Fit Between The Knees (2010) Ergonomics, 53 (10), pp. 1228-1338; Faber, G.S., Kingma, I., van Dieën, J.H., Effects of Ergonomic Interventions on Low Back Moments Are Attenuated By Changes In Lifting Behaviour (2007) Ergonomics, 50 (9), pp. 1377-1391; Faber, G.S., Kingmaand, I., van Dieën, J.H., (2011) Effect of Initial Horizontal Object Position on Peak L5/S1 Moments in Manual Lifting is Dependent on Task Type and Familiarity with Alternative Lifting Strategies Ergonomics, 54 (1), pp. 72-81; MdDeros, B., Daruis, D.D.I., Ismail, A.R., Rahim, A.R.A., Work Posture and Back Pain Evaluation in a Malaysian Food Manufacturing Company (2010) American Journal of Applied Sciences, 7 (4), pp. 473-479; Dolan, P., Adams, M.A., Repetitive Lifting Tasks Fatique the Back Muscles and Increase Bending Moment Acting On the Lumbar Spine (1998) Journal of Biomechanics, 31 (8), pp. 713-721; Adam, C., (2006) Encyclopedia of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, , CRC Press; Whiting, W.C., Rugg, S., (2006) Dynatomy: Dynamic Human Anatomy, Human Kinetics, , New York; Xu, Y., Bach, E., Elsaorhede, Work Environment and Low Back Pain: The Influence of Occupational Activities (1997) Occupational Environmental Medicine, 4 (10), pp. 741-745; Suaidicani, P., Hansen, K., Fenger, A.M., Gyntelberg, F., Low Back Pain in Steelplant Workers (1994) Occupational Medicine, 44 (4), pp. 217-221; Wai, E.K., Roffey, D.M., Bishop, P., Kwon, B.K., Dagenais, S., Causal Assessment of Occupational Carrying and Low Back Pain: Results of a Systematic (2010) Review Spine Journal, 10 (7), pp. 628-638; Mazloum, A., Nozad, H., Kumashiro, M., Occupational Low Back Pain among Workes in Some Small-Sized Factories in Ardabil Iran (2005) Industrial Health, 44 (1), pp. 135-139; Lin, Y.H., Chen, C.S., Chen, W.J., Cheng, C.K., Characteristic of Manual Lifting Activities in the Patients with Low Back Pain (2002) International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, 29 (2), pp. 101-106; Boos, N., Aebi, M., (2008) Spinal Disorders: Fundamentals of Diagnosis and Treatment, Springer, , New York; Bartleson, J.D., Gordon, D.H., (2009) Spine Disorder: Medical and Surgical Management, , Cambridge University Press, New York; Maton, A., (1993) Human Biology and Health, , Prentice Hall, New York; Eizenberg, N., Briggs, C., Adams, C., Ahern, G.G., (2008) General anatomy: Principles and applications, , Sydney, NSW: McGraw Hill Education; Larivière, C., Gagnon, D., Loisel, P., A biomechanical comparison of lifting techniques between subjects with and without chronic lowback pain during freestyle lifting and lowering tasks (2002) Clinical Biomechanics, 1 (2), pp. 89-98; Yoon, J., Shiekhzadeh, A., Nordin, M., The effect of load weight vs. pace on muscle recruitment during lifting (2012) Applied Ergonomics, 43 (6), pp. 1044-1050; Farfan, H., (1973) Mechanical Disorders of the Low Back, , Philadelphia: Lea and Febiger; Kops, L., Natarajan, S., Time Partitioning Based on the Job-Flow Schedule-A New Approach to Optimum Allocation of Jobs on Machine Tools (1994) International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 9 (3), pp. 204-210; Jäger, M., Sawatzki, K., Glitsch, U., Ellegast, R., Ottersbach, H.J., Schaub, K., Franz, G., Luttmann, A., Load on the lumbar spine of flight attendants during pushing and pulling trolleys aboard aircraft (2007) International Journal Industrial Ergonomics, 37 (11-12), pp. 863-876; Lavender, S.A., Li, Y.C., Natarajan, R.N., Andersson, G.B.J., Does the asymmetry multiplier in the 1991 NIOSH lifting equation adequately control the biomechanical loading of the spine?

The study was investigating the design parameters for the casting mold and simulated the temperature and pressure on the mold. Compressor impeller selected as the product of the study. Among the various types of casting techniques, investment casting process is the most suitable process to produce the compressor impeller. The alternative design of casting mold of investment casting was generated using CAD software. Concept scoring was prepared to select the suitable design for the investment casting process. Material selection of compressor is Aluminum Silicon Carbide. Stainless steel AISI H13 is selected as the material for the mold. The parameter for the mold design is included branch, gating, sprue and runner. The analysis was presented to the mold by using ANSYS simulation tool to determine the temperature and pressure of the mold.

However, this approach has disadvantages, mainly arising from the particle addition and the stirring method. There is certainly local solidification of the melt induced by the particles during particle addition. This condition increases the viscosity of the slurry and appears as air pockets between the particles. Moreover, the rate of particle addition needs to be slowed down particularly when the volume fraction of the particles to used increases. This study proposes the new methodology of producing cast MMC by investment casting. Deformations of the die-wax and shell alloy systems are considered in a coupled manner, but the coupled deformation of the wax-shell system is not included. Therefore, this study presents the tasks pertaining to metal matrix composites and their interactions. As a result, the work on wax and wax-die interactions is discussed. This study presents the use of computer programs for determining the wax pattern dimensions based on three-dimensional finite-element simulations. The model for coupled thermal and mechanical analysis is developed by ProCAST. The wax model is described. The following factors are considered in the analysis: (1) the restraint due to geometrical features in the metal die; and (2) process parameters such as dwell time, die/platen temperature, injection pressure, and injection temperature. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Compressor; Design; Investment casting; Metal matrix composite; Simulation","Air pockets; Alloy system; Coupled deformation; Design and simulation; Dwell time; Finite element simulations; Geometrical features; Injection pressures; Injection temperature; Local solidification; Matrix materials; Metal die; Metal matrix composite; Metal matrix composites; Molten metal; Particle addition; Process parameters; Reinforcement particles; Simulation; Thermal and mechanical analysis; Wax models; Wax pattern; Casting; Computer simulation; Deformation; Dies; Investment casting; Investments; Liquid metals; Metals; Molten materials; Precision casting; Vortex flow; Metallic matrix composites",,,,,,"Vendra, L.J., Rabiei, A., A study on aluminum-steel composite metal foam processed by casting (2007) Materials Science and Engineering A, 465 (1-2), pp. 59-67. , DOI 10.1016/j.msea.2007.04.037, PII S0921509307006491; Naher, S., Brabazon, D., Looney, L., Development and assessment of a new quick quench stir caster design for the production of metal matrix composites (2005) Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 166 (3), pp. 430-439. , DOI 10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2004.09.043, PII S0924013604010970; Miracle, D.B., Metal matrix composites - From science to technological significance (2005) Composites Science and Technology, 65 (SPEC.

In this research, eggshell as a natural composite bioceramics was used to modify and improve the mechanical properties of an existing polyethylene which is widely used to manufacture daily goods by small medium industries in Malaysia. Chicken eggshell containing 95% Calcium Carbonate is highly potential to be used as bio-filler to improve poly-based matrix in improving their performance behavior. PE was chosen for this project to modify its virgin mechanical properties by reinforcing eggshell/calcium carbonate and later investigate its character to improve the current product's performance. Tensile, creep and flexural tests were carried out to characterize the developed PE-CaCO3 composites. Eggshells which were prepared into hundreds of microns and furnace dried at 90°C continuously for eight hours to improve the bonding capability. They were then particulated into polyethylene matrix accordingly as per the designed weight ratios, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%. From the result, it was learnt that the ES filler has improved mechanical properties of virgin PE as far as 5% to 9% depending on the filler weight ratio.

ES contains about 95% calcium carbonate in the form of calcite and 5% organic materials such as type X collagen, sulfated polysaccharides, and other proteins. Although there have been several attempts to use eggshell components for different applications, its chemical composition and availability makes eggshell a potential source of filler for PP composites. In this research work, different proportions of chicken eggshell as bio-filler for polypropylene (PP) composite were compared with different operating temperature by creep test, hardness test and SEM photomicrographs. The eggshell had been prepared by blending and sieving them into granule size of less than 160μm. The granules were then mixed with polypropylene into four weight ratios, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% respectively using fine extruder, where silane was used as the coupling agent. From the result, it was learnt that, the ES filler had improved Creep Strain and Creep Modulus for the operating temperatures of 34°C and 80°C. Tensile and flexural tests were also performed to study the pattern and behaviour of the chicken egg shell particulated polypropylene. In general, the findings can be concluded that not all ratios of particulation yielded positive as expected, but there were also conditions where virgin polypropylene yields better result depending on the test type and composite matrices. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Bio-filler; Composite materials; Creep; Eggshell; Polypropylene","Bio-filler; Chemical compositions; Composite matrices; Creep modulus; Creep strain; Creep tests; Egg shells; Eggshell; Environmental hazards; Flexural tests; Granule size; Hardness test; Industrial by-products; Operating temperature; Organic materials; Particulation; Potential sources; Sulfated polysaccharides; Type X collagen; Weight ratios; Animals; Blending; Calcium carbonate; Carbonate minerals; Coupling agents; Creep; Engineering research; Fillers; Granulation; Hardness testing; Plastic products; Temperature; Thermoplastics; Reinforced plastics",,,,,,"Arias, J.L., Fernandez, M.S., (2003) Material Charact., 50, pp. 189-195; Yang, K., Yang, Q., Li, G., Sun, Y., Feng, D., Morphology and mechanical properties of polypropylene/calcium carbonate nanocomposites (2006) Materials Letters, 60 (6), pp. 805-809. , DOI 10.1016/j.matlet.2005.10.020, PII S0167577X05009833; Zebarjad, S.M., Tahani, M., Sajjadi, S.A., Influence of filler particles on deformation and fracture mechanism of isotactic polypropylene (2004) Journal of Materials Processing Technology, pp. 155-160; Da Silva, A.L.N., Rocha, M.C.G., Moraes, M.A.R., Valente, C.A.R., Coutinho, F.M.B., Mechanical and rheological properties of composites based on polyolefin and mineral additives (2002) Polymer Testing, 21 (1), pp. 57-60. , DOI 10.1016/S0142-9418(01)00047-2, PII S0142941801000472; Hartikainen, J., Hine, P., Szabo, J.S., Lindner, M., Harmia, T., Duckett, R.A., Friedrich, K., Polypropylene hybrid composites reinforced with long glass fibres and particulate filler (2005) Composites Science and Technology, 65 (2), pp. 257-267. , DOI 10.1016/j.compscitech.2004.07.010, PII S0266353804001812; Ma, C.G., Mai, Y.L., Rong, M.Z., Ruan, W.H., Zhang, M.Q., Phase structure and mechanical properties of ternary polypropylene/ elastomer/nano-CaCO3 composites (2007) Composites Science and Technology, 67 (14), pp. 2997-3005. , DOI 10.1016/j.compscitech.2007.05.022, PII S0266353807002217, Polymer Nanocomposites - Modeling, Mechanical and Functional Properties Polymer Nanocomposites; Gai, G.S., Yang, Y.F., Fan, S.M., Cai, Z.F., Preparation and properties of composite mineral powders (2005) Powder Technology, 153, pp. 153-158; Gong, G., Xie, B.-H., Yang, W., Li, Z.-M., Zhang, W.-Q., Yang, M.-B., Essential work of fracture (EWF) analysis for polypropylene grafted with maleic anhydride modified polypropylene/calcium carbonate composites (2005) Polymer Testing, 24 (4), pp. 410-417. , DOI 10.1016/j.polymertesting.2005.02.004, PII S0142941805000292","Sivarao; Faculty of Manufacturing Engineering, , Ayer Keroh, Melaka, Malaysia; email: sivarao@utem.edu.my",,,,"International Conference on Advances in Materials and Processing Technologies, AMPT 2009","26 October 2009 through 29 October 2009",,85855,10226680,9783037850534,,,"English","Adv.

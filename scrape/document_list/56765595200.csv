This biometric application is more hygienic comparing with other biometric systems since there is no direct contact between face and camera. Moreover, it is a low cost setup. A sparse representation algorithm as a part of compressive sensing was used in this paper with the accuracy achieved up to 88% during non-optimized sensing matrix and with the average time process of 4.37 seconds. The accuracy achieved was 94% during optimized sensing matrix but the average time process was slower at 8.73 seconds. Encryption process also happened during the image compression which not only reduced the size of the image but also increased the data security. © 2015 IIJ.","Biometric; Compressive sensing; Encryption; Face verification; Security; Sparse representation algorithm",,,,,,"Orsdemir, A., Altun, H.O., Sharma, G., Bocko, M.F., On The Security and Robustness of Encryption Via Compressed Sensing (2008) IEEE Military Communications Conference, pp. 1-7. , 16-19 Nov; Tropp, J.A., Gilbert, A.C., Signal Recovery from Random Measurement via Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (2007) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 53 (12), pp. 4655-4666; Rebollo-Neira, R., Lowe, D., Optimized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit Approach (2002) IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 9 (4), pp. 137-140; Householder, A.S., Unitary Triangularization of a Nonsymmetric Matrix (1958) Journal of the ACM, 5 (5), pp. 339-342; Bauer, F.L., Fike, C.T., Norms and Exclusion Theorems (1960) Numerische Mathematik, 2 (1), pp. 137-141; Barni, M., Cappellini, V., Mecocci, A., Fast Vector Median Filter Based on Euclidean Norm Approximation (1994) IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 1 (6), pp. 92-94; Gower, J.C., Properties of Euclidean and non-Euclidean Distance Matrices (1985) Linear Algebra and Its Applications, 67, pp. 81-97; Danielsson, P.E., Euclidean Distance Mapping (1980) Computer Graphics and Image Processing, 14 (3), pp. 227-248; Abolghasemi, V., Ferdowsi, S., Makiaabadi, B., Sanie, S., On Optimization of the Measurement Matrix for Compressive Sensing (2010) 18th European Signal Processing Conference, pp. 427-431. , 23-27 August",,,,"Internetworking Indonesia",,,,,19429703,,,,"English","Internetworking Indones.

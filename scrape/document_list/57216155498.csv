This research will incorporate AR technology into the Cibubur Apartement Transpark catalog. The purpose of this research is to build a 3D image visualization process in apartment brochures as a more informative and communicative promotional media so that users can get information about virtual apartments. This application is an application that runs on the Android mobile platform, where the AR application requires streaming video taken from the camera as an input source, then this application will track and detect markers (markers) using the tracking system, after markers are detected, and make images on apartment marker catalog as if the apartment model is real. AR provides a more realistic interaction and is a progression of a promising technological method. © 2020, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

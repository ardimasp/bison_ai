However, technology and human resources in Indonesia and creative economy development are still constrained by the limited quantity and quality of business-owner skills in the creative sector and also operations and business management. This impacts the development of the creative industry which is currently sluggish. The aim of this research is to analyze the problems in building knowledge management technology based on a mobile app for SMEs. Such applications are aimed at being able to capture, regulate, store, and spread knowledge with practitioners and disseminate existing SMEs knowledge. The SEM method is applied in inferential analysis to process data obtained through surveys and questionnaires with a total of 204 samples conducted in the city of JABODETABEK. Research and development and software development methodologies were used to develop a knowledge management system for SMEs. Based on the results of an investigation of benefits (perceive usefulness), obtained from the use of knowledge management technology in terms of uploading knowledge in the form of videos, discussion forums, and articles on SMEs will influence the perceived behavioral intention to use (ITU) an app application for knowledge management, thus giving rise to increased usage of knowledge management technology, thus giving rise to a positive attitude towards usage (ATU) of knowledge management technology. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Knowledge management; Mobile application; SEM; SMEs","Economic analysis; Intelligent computing; International trade; Knowledge based systems; Research and development management; Scanning electron microscopy; Software design; Surveys; Design and Development; Knowledge management system; Knowledge management technology; Mobile applications; Research and development; Small and medium scale enterprise; SMEs; Software development methodologies; Knowledge management",,,,"Binus University: 23/AKM/MONOPNT/ 2019","Acknowledgement.

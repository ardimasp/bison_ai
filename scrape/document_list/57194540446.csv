Evaluation is carried out to see the community's acceptance of the application and the effectiveness of the application in the process of making passports. The research is based on a set of questionnaires circulated to the public who will make passports at the Immigration office. Based on the data obtained, the author will measure the performance of the passport queue application using a combination of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) method and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Based on the overall results of testing of the questionnaire data, it can be concluded that the community feels the benefits and ease of use of Passport Queue application. © 2019 IEEE.","community acceptance; passport queue; TAM; UTAUT","Information management; Surveys; community acceptance; Ease-of-use; Information and technologies; passport queue; Questionnaire data; Technology acceptance model; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); UTAUT; Queueing theory",,,,,"Park, S.Y., An analysis of the technology acceptance model in understanding university students behavioral intention to use e-learning (2009) Educational Technology, 12 (3), pp. 150-162; Alharbi, S., Dan Drew, S., Using the technology acceptance model in understanding academics' behavioral intention to use learning management systems (2014) (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science Applications, 5 (1); Hung, S.Y., Chang, C.M., Dan Yu, T.J., Determinants of user acceptance of the e-government services: The case of online tax filing and payment system (2006) Government Information Quarterly, 23 (1), pp. 97-122; Gregory, P.J., (2015) Research Methods for the Behavioral Sciencie, , Los Angeles: Sage Publications; Suryabrata, S., (2000) Metode Penelitian.

The study was carried out for the analysis and evaluation of the acceptance of technology in the mobile payment GO-Pay using the technology acceptance model (TAM). The research was carried out using the quantitative research approach by obtaining 284 active respondents using the GO-Pay mobile payment. The research question in this research is whether GO-Pay as a mobile payment system can be accepted in Indonesia? The result of this research is factor of perceived about usefulness, ease of use, mobility, and the attitude factor can make GO-Pay as mobile payment is acceptable in Indonesia. For the perceived trust, it is not a significant effect, but the effect on perceived trust is perceived reputation, while for the environmental risk it does not affect the perceived reputation. © 2018 IEEE.","adoption; FinTech; go-pay; mobile payment; TAM","Global system for mobile communications; Information management; Acceptance of technologies; adoption; Analysis and evaluation; FinTech; go-pay; Mobile payment; Mobile payment system; Technology acceptance model; Electronic money",,,,,"Sandhyaduhita, P., (2017) Investigating Mobile Payment Acceptance Using Technological-Personal-Environmental ( TPE ), , Framework : A Case o f Indonesia; Junadi, Sfenrianto, A model of factors influencing consumers intention to use e-payment system in Indonesia (2015) Procedia Comput.

But in some activities, such as the management of research, the utilization is still not felt. So the implementation process within the scope of research management at universities is not easy and tends to be slow. The purpose of this study is to determine what features that are needed for the research grants management system and its relationship with the research university roadmap. Research and design that are done in this study focus on designing a model of management information systems research grants. The study was conducted by interviewing and distributing questionnaires to several researchers and managers of research grants in Jakarta, and comparing with literature review. The study also used Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) with Unified Modeling Language notation to design the model. The result of this research is a model of management information systems research grants, which are designed to support operational activities, including the submission, assessment, monitoring, final reporting, and reporting to management and following the university research roadmap as the main contribution of this research. © 2016 IEEE.","management information system; research grant management; web-based system","Computer software; Information systems; Life cycle; Management information systems; Modeling languages; Software design; Surveys; Unified Modeling Language; Websites; Implementation process; Operational activity; Research grants; Research universities; Software development life cycle; University research; Web based information technology; Web-based system; Information management",,,,,"(2013) Terms and Conditions of Research Council FEC Grants, , http//www.rcuk.ac.uk/RCUK-prod/assets/documents/documents/tcfec.pdf, Research Council UK,[Accessed 12 March 2016],rfsti October; Tauginiene, L., The roles of a research administrator at a university (2009) Viešoji Politika Ir Administravimas, (30), pp. 45-56; Mitchell, H.M., (2008) Grants Management 101: Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Grants, , https//www2.massgeneral.org/mgpa/docs/Mary%20Mitchell%20Grants%20Management%20101.pdf, 1 January ,[Accessed 12 March 2016]; Kaplan, N., The role of the research administrator (1959) Administrative Science Quarterly, 4, pp. 20-42; Bowonder, B., The research manager and his roles (1980) Journal of the Society of, 12 (1); (2014) Guide of Applicants, , http//erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/info_for_applicants_adg_2014.pdf, European Research Council,[Accessed 2016 March 12],June; Pope, E., (2013) A Consumers Guide to Grants Management Systems, , http//smartsimple.com/images/brochures/Idealware%27s-A-Consumers-Guide-to-Grants-Management-Software-2013-Excerpt.pdf, November ,[Accessed 12 3 2016]; Fernandes, F., Song, M., UML-checker: An approach for verifying UML behavioral diagrams (2014) Journal of Software, 9 (5), pp. 1229-1236; Ferrante, S., Bonacina, S., Pinciroli, F., (2013) Modeling Stroke Rehabilitation Processes Using the Unified Modeling Language (UML), , Elsevier; Satzinger, J.W., Jackson, R.B., Burd, S.D., (2009) Systems Analysis and Design in A Changing World, , Cengage, Boston; Ruparelia, N.B., Software development lifecycle models (2010) ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes, pp. 8-13; Whitten, J.L., Bentley, L.D., (2007) Systems Anlysis and Design Methods, , New York: McGraw-Hill; O'Brien, J.A., Marakas, G., (2009) Management Information System, , Boston: McGraw-Hill",,,"BINUS Univerity;IEEE Indonesia Section;Wiley","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 International Conference on Information Management and Technology, ICIMTech 2016","16 November 2016 through 18 November 2016",,127842,,9781509033522,,,"English","Proc.

This study focuses in to renew the application and evaluate the updated application for visually impaired children developed by utility Unity software. Besides, standards of good gamification are worthy of study and can increase the motivation to learn, and it only can happen if it meets the needs of the user. To achieve those goals, it has completed some development on several sections includes the homepage, input text, text size, and scoring. In this paper, System Usability Scale (SUS) is utilized, and some statistical model is conducted such as average, mean, Pearson-Product Moment correlation, T-test, and ANOVA. T-test results show that no difference between the partial and fully visually impaired participant, gender, and participants who used a similar application and not. The grades do not affect the SUS score, so it proved that the collected SUS score as average 75 is an objective result from the users although the average grade is 46. Moreover, both variable usability (0.884) and variable learnability (0.771) are positively correlated toward the System Usability Scale, notwithstanding variable usability and variable learnability is not correlated (0.383). The impact of this research can improve the industries especially the education field in Indonesia and some expectations from that result are included experience, knowledge, and skills of the users that need to be evaluated in further research. Hence, in the future, by using this application, we can increase the standard of living visually impaired people and enhance industry 4.0 in Indonesia. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

The purpose of this current study is to evaluate the user experience of an application called Teksologi: Gamification interactive typing for visually impaired children in Indonesia. User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) were applied to measure several aspects include attractiveness, dependability, efficiency, perspicuity, novelty, and stimulation. A total of 22 visually impaired participants had been involved for this study. Besides, Alpha Cronbach test and directly check the means of each items inside the scales to draw the conclusions were conducted to examine the consistency of each aspect, then comparison to UEQ benchmark also applied. The result show that all the quality aspect is positive. At the same time, stimulation had the highest value, but perspicuity had the smallest value that enhancement will be needed to make user feel easy to get familiar with the application, easy to learn to use the application. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

The process of applying gamification is included understanding the target audience and the context, defining learning objectives, structuring the experience, identify resources, and applying gamification elements. Some typing applications for visually impaired people are consuming braille, touchscreen, and delivered in English. As for some educational-based gamified applications have not supported typing for the blind children especially in Indonesia. Therefore, in this contribution, a novel gamified application for typing is presented. Moreover, this application is delivered in Indonesian language. As a material for typing, this application consumes questions based on the curriculum applied in Indonesia. This model is developed with utilized the Game Development Life Circle (GDLC) method which includes initialization, pre-production, production, testing, and release. The application has been tested on several respondents. The respondents believe that this application is valuable, easy to use, and easy to understand. © 2017 The Authors.

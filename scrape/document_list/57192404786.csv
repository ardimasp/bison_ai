This method has been used in various fields including in the health field. In this research, ordinal logistic regression is used to describe the relationship between nutritional status of children with age, gender, height, and family status. Nutritional status of children in this research is divided into over nutrition, well nutrition, less nutrition, and malnutrition. The purpose for this research is to describe the characteristics of children in the KarangKitri Village and to determine the factors that influence the nutritional status of children in the KarangKitri village. There are three things that obtained from this research. First, there are still children who are not categorized as well nutritional status. Second, there are children who come from sufficient economic level which include in not normal status. Third, the factors that affect the nutritional level of children are age, family status, and height. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.","logistic regression; nutritional status of children; odds ratio; ordinal logistic regression; probability",,,,,,"Agresti, A., (2007) An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis, pp. 280-282. , New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons; Das, S., Rahman, R.M., (2011) Nutrition Journal, 1-12; Kleinbaum, D.G., Klein, M., (2010) Logistic Regression, pp. 466-481. , London: Springer; Norris, C.M., Ghali, W.A., Saunders, D., Brant, R., Galbraith, D., Faris, P., Knudtson, M.L., (2006) Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, 59, pp. 448-456; O'Connel, A.A., (2006) Logistic Regression Models for Ordinal Response Variable, pp. 27-30. , California: Sage; Yongharto, K.O., Suroso, J., Ohyver, M., (2012) Opportunity Analysis of Nutritional Status for Children Using Multinomial Logistic Regression Based on Computer, , Undergraduate, Thesis, Bina Nusantara University",,"Purqon A.Hwu R.J.-R.Hidayat T.Arimura H.","","American Institute of Physics Inc.","5th International Conference on Mathematics and Natural Sciences, ICMNS 2014","2 November 2014 through 3 November 2014",,115934,0094243X,9780735413245,,,"English","AIP Conf.

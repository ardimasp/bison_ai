RTOS have better system response than General Purpose Operating System (GPOS), this system response is important for mobile robot, for example mobile robot should stop as soon as possible when the sensor detect the wall. RTOS system analysis on SBC covers several points such as, distance measurement precision resulted by the sensor, the value of latency resulted, and data renewal process due to system interaction on the environment surrounding by ultrasonic sensor. Achieved results show RTOS with Qt-based program and using multithread is well implemented on the SBC, proven by the robot's ability to respond less than 1 second. This result can be accounted as soft real time system. Cyclictest results for proving RTOS and GPOS (General Purpose Operating System) performance shows average latency difference between both systems are up to 300us where RTOS are only 9 us. © 2014 IEEE.","Multi-threading; Pandaboard Single Board Computer; Qt; Real Time Operating System; Soft Realtime; Ultrasonic Sensor","Interactive computer systems; Linux; Mobile robots; Multitasking; Online systems; Real time systems; Robots; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonic sensors; Multi-threading; Qt; Real time operating system; Single board computers; Soft real time; Computer operating systems",,,,,"Aroca, R.V., Glauco, C., (2009) A Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS) Comparison, , Sao Carlos-SP-Brasil; Vijay, S., (2006) A Study of Real-Time Embedded Software Systems and Real-Time Operating Systems, , M.

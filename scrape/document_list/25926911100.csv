However, we have to select the suitable one related to the problems. This paper presents an implementation of the Dynamic Systems Development Methodology (DSDM) and Object-Oriented (OO) as two combine methods to develop an application of billing in a mental hospital (study case in Indonesia). The application allows the management of the mental hospitals to control and evaluate patient services, and it supports decision-makers for improving the organization. Based on literature studies, we obtained the suitable two methods for DSDM adjusted to the resources, the time frame, the goals, and the required functionality. Meanwhile OO is a highly iterative approach. Data results of the interviews, questionnaires, observations, and artifacts were analyzed according to the user requirement process. The study can be concluded that DSDM and OO method is effective in developing an application.

Large amount of medical data of DM patients is available and it provides significant advantage for researchers to fight against DM. The main objective of this research is to leverage F-Score Feature Selection and Fuzzy Support Vector Machine in classifying and detecting DM. Feature selection is used to identify the valuable features in dataset. SVM is then used to train the dataset to generate the fuzzy rules and Fuzzy inference process is finally used to classify the output. The aforementioned methodology is applied to the Pima Indian Diabetes (PID) dataset. The results show a promising accuracy of 89.02% in predicting patients with DM. Additionally, the approach taken provides an optimized count of Fuzzy rules while still maintaining sufficient accuracy. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Fatigue and distraction are a major risk factor that causes traffic accidents, severe injuries, and a high risk of death. Some progress has been made for driver drowsiness detection using a contact-based method that utilizes vehicle parts (such as steering angle and pressure on the pedal) and physiological signals (electrocardiogram and electromyogram). However, a contactless system is more potential for real-world conditions. In this study, we propose a computer vision based method to detect driver's drowsiness from a video taken by a camera. The method attempts to recognize the face and then detecting the eye in every frame. From the detected eye, iris regions for left and right eyes are used to calculate the PERCLOS measure (the percentage of total time that eye is closed). The proposed method was evaluated based on public YawDD video dataset. The results found that PERCLOS value when the driver is alert is lower than when the driver is drowsy. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Health risks; Highway accidents; Contactless systems; Driver drowsiness; Electromyo grams; Face features; Physiological signals; Steering angles; Video dataset; Vision-based methods; Human computer interaction",,,,,,"Jusuf, A., Nurprasetio, I.P., Prihutama, A., Macro Data Analysis of Traffic Accidents in Indonesia (2017) Journal of Engineering and Technological Sciences, 49 (1), pp. 132-143; Williamson, A., Lombardi, D.A., Folkard, S., Stutts, J., Courtney, T.K., Connor, J.L., The link between fatigue and safety (2011) Accident Analysis & Prevention, 43 (2), pp. 498-515; Sahayadhas, A., Sundaraj, K., Murugappan, M., Detecting driver drowsiness based on sensors: A review (2012) Sensors, 12 (12), pp. 16937-16953; Viola, P., Jones, M., Rapid object detection using a boosted cascade of simple features (2001) Proc.

In terms of tool wear resistance, tools with suitable film coating are forty times better than uncoated tools. Cutting tools are usually coated by Titanium Nitride (TiN), since it has properties such as resistance to wear and hardness resulting in increased cutting performance. Genetic algorithms (GAs) belong to the powerful artificial intelligence optimization family of evolutionary algorithm-based metaheuristic techniques. Since their inception, they have been successfully applied in numerous areas of industrial sectors as material design, tools coating and cutting, alloy design, and so on. In this research work, predicting thin film coating thickness of titanium nitride (TiN) on tungsten carbide (WC) inserts is presented. First, (WC) inserts were coated by TiN in different conditions using Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD), and the surface profilometer was used to measure thickness of the WC coated specimens. Second, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to generate the objective function which represents the process parameters and coating thickness. Third, using a fitness function model, GAs were established to optimize the thickness value of TiN layer with respect to changes in three process parameters, namely Nitrogen gas pressure (N2), Argon gas pressure (Ar), and Turntable Speed (TT). Finally, for performance measurement, three real experimental tests were carried out in terms of Prediction Interval (PI) and Residual Error (e) to validate the RSM model. The actual coating thickness of validation data fell within the 95% (PI) and the (e) values percentage were very low. In terms of optimization, GAs is capable optimizing thickness better than the average experimental value, with a reduction ratio of 73.4%. © 2018 Author(s).",,,,,,"Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka

There is a lack of development of e-learning in a remote city like Kupang East Nusa Tenggara Indonesia which is located far away from the capital city. This research aims to assess the effectiveness of e-learning by analyzing three factors in one of the higher institution in Kupang city, i.e. Sekolah Tinggi Kesehatan Citra Mandiri Husada Kupang (STIKes CHMK). The factors include culture, technology and infrastructure, and content satisfaction. The data were collected using questionnaires. Research shows that with proper preparation for e-learning, the acceptance of e-learning in rural areas is significantly high. This finding suggests that e-learning can greatly benefit the students like Kupang city in developing countries. Copyright © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

A pre-test is given to measure the proficiency level of learners. The level is divided into elementary, intermediate and advanced. The ALS-KL provides the most suitable materials according to the needs of the learners. We applied the proposed system on 90 learners with different English proficiency level. The effectiveness of the system was evaluated using post-test. The results of the posttest showed that the proposed system was able to improve learners with intermediate- level and advanced level 1.5 times and 4 times respectively while reducing the number of learners with elementary-level by more than 50%.

Manufacturing costs and customization of cutting tool properties are the two main issues in the process of Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD). The aim of this paper is to find the optimal parameters get better thin film roughness using PVD coating process. Three input parameters were selected to represent the solutions in the target data, namely Nitrogen gas pressure (N2), Argon gas pressure (Ar), and Turntable speed (TT), while the surface roughness was selected as an output response for the Titanium nitrite (TiN). Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) equipment was used to characterize the coating roughness. In this study, an approach in modeling surface roughness of Titanium Nitrite (TiN) coating using Response Surface Method (RSM) has been implemented to obtain a proper output result. In order to represent the process variables and coating roughness, a quadratic polynomial model equation was developed. Genetic algorithms were used in the optimization work of the coating process to optimize the coating roughness parameters. Finally, to validate the developed model, actual data were conducted in different experimental run. In RSM validation phase, the actual surface roughness fell within 90% prediction interval (PI). The absolute range of residual errors (e) was very low less than 10 to indicate that the surface roughness could be accurately predicted by the model. In terms of optimization and reduction the experimental data, GAs could get the best lowest value for roughness compared to experimental data with reduction ratio of 46.75%. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","GAs; PVD; Roughness; RSM; TiN coating",,,,,,,"Tuffy, K., Byrne, G., Dowling, D., Determination of the optimum TiN coating thickness on WC inserts for machining carbon steels (2004) J.

The proposed method relax the recent sparse-based technique for removing specular highlights that require multiple input images. Instead, we use only a single input image and then generate multiple specular-free images from this image. The specular removal problem is formulated as the recovery of a sparse representation and an outlier representation. From the obtained specular-free images, a dictionary is reconstructed as the basis function for sparse representation. The sparse signal and the dictionary is used to estimate diffuse image while the specular image is obtained from the outlier. The sparse coding was solved using alternating direction method of multiplier. In addition, a new variant of the specular-free image based on XYZ color space is also proposed to improve sparse representation. The experimental results showed that this method outperformed the accuracy of standard specular removal methods. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Statistics; Alternating direction method of multipliers; Basis functions; Multiple inputs; Sparse representation; Sparse signals; Specular free image; Specular highlight; XYZ color spaces; Image segmentation",,,,,,"Shafer, S.A., Using color to separate reflection components (1985) Color Research & Application, 10 (4), pp. 210-218; Klinker, G.J., Shafer, S.A., Kanade, T., A physical approach to color image understanding (1990) International Journal of Computer Vision, 4 (1), pp. 7-38; Bajcsy, R., Lee, S.W., Leonardis, A., Detection of diffuse and specular interface reflections and inter-reflections by color image segmentation (1996) International Journal of Computer Vision, 17 (3), pp. 241-272; Tan, R.T., Ikeuchi, K., Separating reflection components of textured surfaces using a single image,"" Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (2005) IEEE Transactions on, 27 (2), pp. 178-193; Yoon, K.-J., Choi, Y., Kweon, I.S., Fast separation of reflection components using a specularity-invariant image representation (2006) Image Processing 2006 IEEE International Conference On.

Based on the histogram distribution of the input image, we assume that a specular reflection tends to increase the brightness value and thus it can be separated from diffuse reflection using thresholding technique. To find the optimal threshold values, we use the chaotic clonal selection algorithm. Then, the segmented specular highlight area is replaced with an optimal diffuse patch based on coherency sensitive hashing. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed specular removal method has comparative performance compared to the standard single-based specular removal methods. © 2016 IEEE.","Inpainting; Intrinsic Images; Segmentation; Specular Removal; Thresholding","Color vision; Robotics; Clonal selection algorithms; Comparative performance; Dichromatic reflection; Inpainting; Intrinsic images; Specular reflections; Thresholding; Thresholding techniques; Image segmentation",,,,,,"Nayar, S.K., Fang, X.S., Boult, T., Separation of reflection components using color and polarization (1997) Int.

However, the use of traditional pseudo-random number leads to instability of the solution. This study proposes new Clonal Selection Algorithm (ClonalG) that uses deterministic chaotic dynamical system to replace the use of pseudo-random number. We use logistic map to generate the chaotic number with uniform distribution. The chaotic number is used to substitute the pseudo-random number for the population initialisation, affinity maturation and new antibodies generation. The algorithm behaves stable in terms of the final solution. The proposed algorithm was evaluated and used for multiple image segmentation on nine standard test images. The results confirmed that the proposed algorithm was more effective and stable in comparison to conventional ClonalG and Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO).

One of the main reasons is because the weighted combination of image energy functions can produce totally different B-Spline snake behaviors. Some efforts have been focused to improve the external energy forces but also lead to higher computational cost. In this research, an approach based on the particle swarm optimization is utilized to control the snake behavior without the necessity of computing the additional information. In the proposed approach, the weighted parameters are optimized using particle swarm optimization by evaluating control points of B-Spline snake in the image energy terms. This method enables the snake to initialize the image energy coefficient automatically and in more convenient way. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the snake behavior.","Active contour models; B-Spline; Image energy; Particle swarm optimization; Snake behavior","Active contour model; B-spline; B-spline snakes; Complex background; Computational costs; Control point; External energy; Image energy; Object boundaries; Snake behavior; Subjective contours; Interpolation; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Behavioral research",,,,,,"Kass, M., Witkin, A., Terzopoulos, D., Snakes: Active Contour Models (1988) Int.

However, their applications to 3D object recognition receive only little attention. In this paper, CLONALG and PSO algorithms for recognition of 3D object are discussed. Instead of using any predefined model to extract the geometrical information, the 3D object is modeled based on its 2D image appearance. Firstly, the 2D image is segmented using Otsu thresholding method. Secondly, a set of moment features that are invariant under translation, changes in scale, and rotation is extracted. Thirdly, the CLONALG and PSO are used to initialize the neural network weights. Then, the neural network training is continued by Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The experimental results showed that the CLONALG-LM is better than PSO-LM and the other traditional training algorithms: Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG), Gradient Descent (GD), Gradient Descent with Momentum (GDM), Gradient Descent with Adaptive Learning Rate (GDA), and Gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate (GDMA). © 2011 IEEE.","3D object recognition; clonal selection algorithm; neural network training; particle swarm optimization","2D images; 3D object; 3d object recognition; Adaptive learning rates; Clonal selection algorithms; CLONALG; Computer vision problems; Geometrical informations; Gradient descent; Levenberg-Marquardt; Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; Network weights; neural network training; PSO algorithms; Scaled conjugate gradients; Set of moments; Thresholding methods; Training algorithms; Wide spectrum; Conjugate gradient method; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Neural networks; Object recognition; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Three dimensional",,,,,,"Yi, J.H., Chelber, D.M., Model-Based 3D Object Recognition Using Bayesian Indexing (1998) Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 69 (1), pp. 87-105. , Jan. doi:10.1006/cviu.1997.0597; Murase, H., Nayar, S.K., Visual Learning and Recognition of 3D Objects from Appearance (1995) International Journal of Computer Vision, 14 (1), pp. 5-24. , Jan. doi:10.1007/BF01421486; Turka, M., Pentland, A., Eigenface for recognition (1991) Journal of Cognitive and Neuroscience, 3 (1), pp. 71-86. , Winter doi:10.1162/jocn.1991.3.1.71; Mashor, M.Y., Osman, M.K., Arshad, M.R., 3D Object Recognition Using Multiple Views and Neural Networks Proc.

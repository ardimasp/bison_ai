When it is older and no longer used, preservation needs to be done to keep its history. One way to preserves a heritage building through adaptive reuse, which also adds economic value to it. The historic Colomadu sugar factory built in Colomadu district area, near Solo city, Central Java, Indonesia, and then abandoned, now converted into a museum and amusement area named De Tjolomadoe. This adaptive reused tell histories and memories of the Sugar Factory's glorious past. The presence of this space is increasingly popular, in part because of the growing existence of social media. How the visitors of the museum interprets the functions of real space and virtual space, becomes the context discussed in this study. From the results of this study, we will find out how the visitors engaged in adaptive reuse of space which is associated with the visitor's needs of social media. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Social networking (online); Sugar factories; Sugar industry; Adaptive re use; Collective memory; Economic values; Heritage buildings; Indonesia; Real-space; Social media; Virtual spaces; Museums",,,,,"Wasino, (2014) Modernisasi di Jantung Budaya Jawa, Mangkunegaran 1896-1944; Knight, G.R., The Sugar Industry of Colonial Java and its Global Trajectory (2000) South East Asia Research, 8 (3), pp. 213-238; Ardhiati, Y., (2018) De Tjolomadoe: Adaptive Reuse Bangunan Cagar Budaya; Bullen, P.A., Adaptive reuse and sustainability of commercial buildings (2007) Facilities, 25 (1-2), pp. 20-31; Conejos, S., Langston, C., Smith, J., Improving the Implementation of Adaptive Reuse Strategies for Historic Building (2011) Le Vie Dei Mercanti SAVE HERITAGE: Safeguard of Architectural, Visual, Environmental Heritage; Misirlisoy, D., Günçe, K., Adaptive reuse strategies for heritage buildings: A holistic approach (2016) Sustainable Cities and Society, 26, pp. 91-98; Shen, L.Y., Langston, C., Adaptive reuse potential: An Examination of differences between urban and non-urban project (2010) Facilities, 28 (1-2), pp. 6-16; Bloszies, C., (2012) Old Buildings, New Designs: Architectural Transformations; Wulandari, A.A.A., Fajarwati, A.A.S., Latif, F., The Relationship of Exhibition Space Design and the Success of Delivering Messages to Museum Visitors in Jakarta (2017) Humaniora, 8 (3), p. 219; Cetin, M., Filling an Urban Void as a 'Public Interior' in Balikesir; Contemporary Intervention into Historic Context through Interior Space (2017) A/Z: ITU Journal of Faculty of Architecture, 14, pp. 127-135; Watson, S., Waterton, E., Reading the Visual: Representation and Narrative in the Construction of Heritage (2010) Material Culture Review, 71; Murray, D.C., Notes to self: The visual culture of selfies in the age of social media (2015) Consumption Markets & Culture, 18 (6), pp. 490-516; Carr, D., Selfies on a Stick, and the Social-Content Challenge for the Media (2015) New York Times; Taylor, J., Gibson, L.K., Digitisation, digital interaction and social media: Embedded barriers to democratic heritage (2016) International Journal of Heritage Studies, 23 (5), pp. 408-420; Senft, T.M., Baym, N.K., What does the selfie say?

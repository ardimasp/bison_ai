Knowledge Management enables organizations to collect, store, distribute, and reuse the knowledge that a company's assets have. Likewise in the area of education, knowledge management has now evolved to be easier to deploy. Many colleges have tried to figure out how to use social computing to collaborate with educators and students in knowledge management. The most frequent problem of knowledge management is the willingness of the user to use or distribute it. The collaboration and communication aspects of social computing or web 2.0 is the basic successful use of knowledge management. The purpose of this study is to define and analyze how social computing can be utilized in knowledge management and implemented by the organization so that the purpose of knowledge management can be achieved. This research used TAM to measure the technology acceptance to 60 respondents, as the result all variables are correlated and has influence to the actual use. © 2020 IEEE.","Knowledge management; Social computing; Web 2.0","Social networking (online); Students; Actual use; Indonesia; Internal development; Jakarta; Technology acceptance; Web 2.0; Knowledge management",,,,,,"Shanmugam, M., Sun, S., Amidi, A., Khani, F., Khani, F., The applications of social commerce constructs (2016) Int.

Several cases had been reported due to the usage of a fake transcript. One modus of using fake transcript is to enter a higher level of education and job promotion. The new technology found called Blockchain believes in solving the problem. Characteristics of Blockchain Technology such as secured, immutable, distributed, transparent seem to be matched with transcript document requirement. Therefore, the research tries to create a process model of the university teaching and learning process. Several studies have been done; however, no detailed process shown especially for teaching and learning activities. The research question is, how are teaching, and learning activities can be supported by Blockchain Technology? Qualitative method used in this research, focus group discussion with 9 reputable universities discussed the academic operation process and the result show that it is possible to adopt Blockchain Technology into the teaching and learning process to avoid forgery of university transcript documents. © 2020 IEEE.","Blockchain technology; Blockchain technology-based; Teaching and learning process; Transcript","Blockchain; Information management; Teaching; Innovative solutions; Learning Activity; Level of educations; Operation process; Qualitative method; Research questions; Teaching and learning; University teaching; Learning systems",,,,"12/AKM/PNT/2019","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This study is supported by the Directorate General of Strengthening for Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia as a part of Penelitian Terapan Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Research Grant to Binus University entitled “Implementasi Blockchain Platform Untuk Menciptakan “Good Governance” pada Perguruan Tinggi” or “The Implementation of Blockchain Platform to Create“Good Governance” in Higher Education” with contract number: 12/AKM/PNT/2019 and contract date: 27 March 2019.","Ari, S., (2015) Perguruan Tinggi Harus Waspadai Transkrip Nilai Palsu-Tribun Jogja, , https://jogja.tribunnews.com/2015/01/09/perguruan-tinggi-haruswaspadai-transkrip-nilai-palsu, jogja.

The analysis results show that the target capacity level for the 5 domains is 3. The results of the obtained assessments on EDM03, APO12 and BAI06 are 0, which means the process is incomplete. The value of APO13 capacity is 1 (Process executed) and the value of the capacity DSS05 is 3 (Process established), but not completely reached. There is a difference in the target and current level of capacity that underpins the author to propose recommendations, such as complete the output (work products) at level 1 and generic practices at level 2 and 3. © 2019 IEEE.","capability level; CMMI; COBIT 5; information security; trouble ticket system","Security of data; Surveys; capability level; CMMI; COBIT 5; Customer complaints; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Performance objective; Telecommunications infrastructures; Trouble ticket; Information management",,,,,,"Pham, H.C., Information security burnout: Identification of sources and mitigating factors from security demands and resoources (2019) Journl of Information Security and Applications, pp. 96-107; Kruger, H., Flowerday, S., Drevin, L., Steyn, T., An assessment of the role of cultural factors in information security awareness (2011) Information Security South Africa (ISSA), pp. 1-7; Kim, A.C., Lee, S.M., Lee, D.H., Compliance Risk Assessment Measures of Financial Information Security using System Dynamics (2012) International Journal of Security and Its Applications, 6, pp. 191-200; Waly, N., Organisational information security management: The impact of training and awareness (2013) Evaluating the Socio-technical Impact on Organisational Information Security Policy Management; Merhi, M.I., Ahluwalia, P., Examining the impact of deterrence factors and norms on resistance to information systems security (2018) Computers in Human Behavior; Steinbart, P.J., Raschke, R.L., Gal, G., Dilla, W.N., The influence of a good relationship between the internal audit and information security functions on information security outcomes (2018) Accounting, Organization and Society, pp. 1-15; Hassanzadeh, M., Jahangiri, N., Brewster, B., A conceptual framework for information security awareness, assessment, and training (2014) A Conceptual Framework for Information Security Awareness, Assessment, and Training, pp. 99-109. , In M.

In this point, the transaction raises several new and crucial challenges. At a closer look, the concerns appeared due to no data integration, verification, and validation from parties both inside or outside of the university. In this respect, the data is not centralized or integrated. As this backdrop, this causes repeated data confirmation, and no one can authenticate the data validity when distributed to other parties. In this point of entry, the diploma certification forgery has become one of the significant issues in education in Indonesia. As a framework that enables the data integration, Blockchain contains verified data on every single of a transaction, so the data is trustworthy. With this in mind, this paper aims to discuss the best blockchain model for the university level. This study is qualitative-based research. As a result, McRhys model is introduced as a potential and implementable blockchain model in university in Indonesia. © 2019 IADIS Press.

Nowadays, NFC implementation usually concern in business transaction to replace conventional ways, such as cash and card transaction. But, NFC can be a good opportunity in education industry to support automated several education activities. Nowadays, most of Indonesian people already used Smartphone and familiar with NFC technology, but still don’t have opportunity to use NFC because there is no industry or transaction already use NFC tag in Indonesia. This paper discussed NFC design for education industry, especially for attendance system that can be one of university’s competitive advantages.

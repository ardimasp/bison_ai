Procedural dungeon generation makes it easy for a designer to design a level. The result shows that the algorithm can create a variant dungeon based on the parameter on the game. This game also has a high re-playability, thanks to the generation process. Design/methodology/approach: Research methods include methods of data collection, design and implementation. Data collection was done through research literature, questionnaires and analyzing some similar applications. Designing game application using game design document and implementation was the done using the waterfall model and the unity game engine. Findings: Procedural dungeon generation is important when designing the game. If done correctly, it will reduce the designer’s time to design the map especially in dungeon, where in the dungeon, there are many floors and each floor must be designed differently based on the difficulty level of the game. The application uses the combined algorithm to create a variant dungeon, where each algorithm has its own advantages that the designer can use to design the variety of the dungeon. It also opens more algorithms to be used when creating the dungeon. Originality/value: This paper uses the combined algorithm for procedural dungeon generation, and the result shows that a player has high re-playability to the game. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Game developer; Game industry; Procedural content generation; Procedural dungeon generation; Re-playability; Role-playing game",,,,,,"Hendrikx, M., Meijer, S., Van Der Velden, J., Iosup, A., (2013) Procedural content generation for games: a survey, pp. 1-22. , in, ACM Transaction on Multimedia Computing Communication and Application; Linden, R.V.D., Lopes, R., Bidarra, R., (2014) Procedural generation of dungeons, pp. 1-12. , in, IEEE Transaction on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games; Mark, B., Berechet, T., Mahlmann, T., Togelius, J., (2015) Procedural Generation of 3D Caves for Games on the GPU, , in, Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games, Pacific Grove, CA; Shaker, N., Togelius, J., Nelson, M.J., (2016) Procedural Content Generation in Games: A Textbook and an Overview of Current Research, , Springer, Cham; Togelius, J., Champandard, A.J., Lanzi, P.L., Mateas, M., Paiva, A., Preuss, M., Stanley, K.O., (2013) Procedural content generation: goals, challenges and actionable steps, pp. 61-75. , in, Artificial and Computational Intelligence in Games, Schloss Dagstuhl – Leibniz-Zentrum fuer Informatik, Dagstuhl; Yannakakis, G.N., Togelius, J., (2015) Experience-driven procedural content generation (extended abstract), pp. 519-525. , in, International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction ACII, IEEE Computer Society, Xi’an; Adams, E., Fundamentals of game design (2010) Games and Videogames, p. 13. , in, p., 2nd ed., Pearson Education, Berkeley, CA",,,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,07419058,,,,"English","Libr.

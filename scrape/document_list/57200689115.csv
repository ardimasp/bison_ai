Design/methodology/approach: The empirical study uses a survey conducted on a stratified random sample of 241 Indonesian members of fashion social media brand communities (SMBCs). The research design includes 19 types of SMM actions and 3 types of eWoM engagement behaviors, and investigates their relationship using point-biserial correlation. Findings: Generation of intention to engage in “pass-on” and “endorsement” eWoM has different drivers and serves different purposes. The findings suggest that endorsement engagement is contingent on the consumer’s perceived exposure to marketing action stimuli, while pass-on engagement is driven by cognitive-inducing actions. Research limitations/implications: This study extends current theory on SMM strategy and its relationship with eWoM engagement with a theoretically grounded conceptualization of eWoM engagement behaviors through the use of one-click social plug-ins. Practical implications: The study offers guidelines for fashion brands to effectively design their SMM strategies by identifying specific drivers of consumers’ intention to engage in eWoM. Originality/value: This study identifies sources of generation of eWoM engagement behavioral intention from a fine-grained analysis of marketing actions across various fashion SMBCs. Besides, it extends the applicability of the “mere exposure” effect to the SMM context. The research pioneers the study on fashion consumers’ eWoM engagement behaviors in Indonesia, a country with one of the largest social media populations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand community; Electronic word-of-mouth engagement; Fashion; Indonesia; Perceived exposure; Social media marketing",,,,,"European Commission, EC

The research purpose is to study if characteristics of an influencer‘s Instagram account affect the influencer‘s opinion leadership as well as its consequences on the behavioral intention of Indonesian cosmetic product consumers. The study uses a quantitative survey conducted on 250 Instagram users who follow selected celebgrams or celebrities who endorse cosmetic products. A hypothesized model is built to analyze the antecedents and consequences of the opinion leadership of the two types of influencer. As for opinion leadership antecedents, both models show that originality of the Instagram account is crucial in building up the opinion leadership, while quality and quantity of the Instagram posts are not significant factors. Perceived uniqueness of the account seems to affect the opinion leadership only for celebrity accounts and not for the celebgrams‘. Further, findings suggest that opinion leadership affect consumer behavioral intentions, namely intentions to interact, recommend, and follow advice. Finally, the account's perceived fit with personal interest is not affecting the relationship between opinion leadership and the intention to follow advice for both celebrity and celebgram. The findings suggest some important implications for cosmetic companies in utilizing opinion leaders as their promoters, and also for micro-influencers that are beauty gurus who wish to learn the important key factors to attract more Instagram followers and build their social media communities. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

This study analyses data from six Spanish and Italian SME fashion companies’ in order to understand how fashion brands implement their social media marketing strategies. The research includes a qualitative study, combined with a content analysis of brands’ posts on their Facebook brand-pages. The results suggest that perceived importance of social media as part of corporate marketing strategy is the main driver for brands’ social media marketing implementation, and that brand awareness is the main objective SMEs would like to achieve. The three Spanish brands and one Italian brand appear to take a transactional marketing approach, while the other two Italian brands adopt a hybrid transactional/relational approach. SMEs focus primarily on representation actions; more specifically, promotion and sales.

This study proposes a comprehensive framework that identifies and classifies social media marketing strategic actions. The conceptual framework covers actions that support both transactional and relationship marketing. This research also positions social media marketing strategy and strategic actions in the context of the marketing organization theory, and discusses the impact of the incorporation of social media on the concept of marketing organization. The study offers valuable theoretical insight on social media marketing actions and the deployment of social media marketing strategies in companies. The investigation also provides hints about how to maximize the benefits from social media marketing for customer-oriented, market-driven organizations. © 2016 Journal of Innovation & Knowledge","Marketing organization; Marketing organization theory; Marketing strategy; N-REL; Social media; Social media marketing; Social media marketing actions",,,,,"European Commission, EC

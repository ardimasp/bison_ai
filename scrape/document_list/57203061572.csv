In software development, artificial Intelligence offers a sophisticated enhancement on the programming logic, while blockchain technology provides transparency and relief the obligation to trust in a central party. Both are two different technologies but considered a disruptive technology in recent years. Artificial Intelligence faces several issues related to the validity of data, algorithms, and policies, while blockchain is called so 'friendly' with transparency, trust, and immutability. Both technologies are still in the early stages of their development age. Always, the opportunity for both technologies to converge in some ways would be an exciting area to be explored. This research elaborates on the technical possibilities of application development on the blockchain platform that communicate with AI to do prediction task. Oracle contract allows the data inside Ethereum blockchain to interact with the external data source. © 2020 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Blockchain; Ethereum; Machine Learning","Blockchain; Computation theory; Ethereum; Software design; Transparency; Application development; Disruptive technology; External data sources; Prediction tasks; Programming logic; Artificial intelligence",,,,,"Konstantinidis, I., Siaminos, G., Timplalexis, C., Zervas, P., Peristeras, V., Decker, S., Blockchain for business applications: A systematic literature review (2018) Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, 320, pp. 384-399; Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System; Buterin, V., A next-generation smart contract and decentralized application platform (2014) Etherum, pp. 1-36. , http://buyxpr.com/build/pdfs/EthereumWhitePaper.pdf, January; Richard, Trisetyarso, A., Suparta, W., Kang, C.H., Abbas, B.S., Crypto-governance in stock exchanges: Towards efficient and selfregulated trading system (2019) Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Contemporary Computing and Informatics, IC3I 2019, pp. 192-197. , Dec; Stateofthedapps, DApp Statistics. 2020; McCarthy, J., Minsky, M.L., Rochester, N., Shannon, C.E., A proposal for the dartmouth summer research project on artificial intelligence (1955) Dartmouth Conference; McCarthy, J., Arthur Samuel: Pioneer in Machine Learning, , http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/voy/museum/samuel.html; Lin, K., (2019) Role of Data Science in Artificial Intelligence, , https://towardsdatascience.com/role-of-data-science-in-artificialintelligence-950efedd2579; Omohundro, S., Cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and artificial intelligence (2014) Ai Matters, 1 (2), pp. 19-21. , Dec; Lu, Y., The blockchain: State-of-The-art and research challenges (2019) J.

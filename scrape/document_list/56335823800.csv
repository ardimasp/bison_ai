The grand purpose of our research is to develop drones with implementation in smart farming in Indonesia. In the sending process, the drone must be able to detect objects and reach a goal position and go back safely using GNSS. We proposed the usage of course-over-ground information to help drone in doing autonomous navigation. In the experiment that we did, the average of positional deviation of landing position between the actual landing position and the desired landing position in the flight tests of flying from start to goal is 1.1125 meters and for the tests that use the algorithm which uses course-over-ground, the positional deviation has an average of 2.39 meters. Navigation using the course-over-ground algorithm is not more reliable than the navigation algorithm with GNSS and compass at a navigation distance of less than 1 meter. © ICIC International 2020.","Autonomous spraying drone; Drone; GNSS; Navigation systems; ROS; Sprayer pesticide",,,,,"Binus University","Acknowledgment.

While most DDAs are performance based, mapping multiple performance metrics to satis- faction can be demanding and genre dependent. Such limitations do not apply to emotion based DDA as it attempts to address the main issue of satisfaction directly, rather than using heuristic scores. This study aims to apply emotion based DDA with Facial Ex- pression Recognition (FER) in order to improve player satisfaction. A survival horror game was designed and developed in 2 versions: One implements DDA and the other does not. An empirical experiment (N = 31) was conducted in which both versions were played consecutively. A usability test was applied to evaluating the game and the DDA model in terms of satisfaction. The result indicated that the game, as a survival horror, performed statistically well in providing satisfaction and displayed statistically significant improvement in various performance metrics while applying the proposed DDA model. © 2020 ICIC International.

We argue that the game designed meticulously tailored with the learning subjects can increase the pupils' interest in learning, prevent boredom, and increase the curiosity of the students towards the learning subjects, in this case: Mathematics. The game design method proposed in this research is to combine the Six Facets of Serious Game Design and Ernest Adams' Game Design. The results show that the students that implement the serious game design as their learning tools were statistically performed better than the one who only use traditional learning tools. © 2020 ICIC International.","Game design; Learning tools; Mathematics; Serious game design",,,,,,,"Chowanda, A., Prasetio, Y.

In recent years, an increasing number of Indonesia students are turning their interest to study in Taiwan. However, Chinese education in Indonesia is fundamentally based on studies of Mainland China, therefore lacking opportunities for students to understand profoundly Taiwan's language and culture. Furthermore, there is a lack of opportunities for students to understand game design power and industry in Taiwan. The purpose of this on-going program (2014-recent) is to enhance the understanding of game and animation design education in Taiwan, through exchanges with students in Indonesia. It aims to promote exchanges between the faculty and students at the universities with faculties, lecturers and artists in Taiwan for collaborative work, especially in game art design, game engine and animation. It sincerely hopes that students could understand profoundly Taiwan's language and culture by game and animation online tutorials, and provide opportunities for students to understand game design power and industry in Taiwan, Indonesia, and worldwide market. After a year of implementing the four points mentioned in this article, we have already observed some evident outcome. The biggest achievement comes from the workshop which has received significant responses and an increasing number of attendances from both Taiwan and Indonesia. In the near future, it hopes that we can hold a public event such as lecture, workshop and exhibition to raise awareness of and develop an affinity with Taiwanese langue and culture among the general public using the design thinking approach for computational creativity, such as co-design Taiwan language on-line course or game-based learning. © 2019 IEEE.","Computational Creativity; Design Thinking; Game and Animation; International Exchanges","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Curricula; Engineering education; Exhibitions; Human computer interaction; Students; Animation designs; Asia Pacific region; Chinese educations; Collaborative Work; Computational creativities; Game-based Learning; International exchange; Online tutorials; Animation",,,,"Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia, KPM","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This programme was supported financially by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan.

In sending process, drone must be able to detect object and reach goal position and go back safely using GPS. We proposed a navigation algorithm for drone including the usage of course-over-ground information to help drone in doing autonomous navigation. In the experiment that we did, the average of positional deviation of landing position between the actual landing position and the desired landing position in the flight tests of flying from start to goal is 1.1125 m and for the tests that use the algorithm which uses course-over-ground, the positional deviation has average of 2.39 m.

A dataset with a total of 1632 images from sixteen faces with various poses and angles was trained by using two popular existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures: VGG-19, and Google’s Inception V3 using Caffe deep learning framework. The models then were converted to a light CNN model (i.e., CoreML Model) by using CoreMLTools and Python. The converted models were implemented to an iOS-based application developed using Swift and CoreML SDK. The results show that both models resulted in an accuracy score of 93.2% and 93.3% for VGG-19 and Google’s Inception V3 architectures respectively. The average accuracy score achieved by VGG-19 was 78.7% and Google’s Inception V3 was 78.8%. There is no statistically significant difference between model trained by VGG-19 and Google’s Inception V3 architecture. This almost certainly happened due to the fact that the number of images in the dataset is not significantly large enough to give a significant difference between those two architectures. © 2019, ICIC International.

Some renowned techniques such as local-invariant feature extractors (e.g. Scale-invariant feature transform SIFT, Speeded Up Robust Features SURF), as well as Visual BoW approach were used in place classification problems. Nowadays, deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have the advantages towards computer vision problems including place classification problem. Albeit, there are several renowned datasets existed to help the community to learn the models, there is no publicly exists in places dataset for specifically places in Indonesia. This paper presents methodology to collect data of visual places in Indonesia, learn deep features from the data, and classify visual places in Indonesia. We aims to contribute a large dataset as well as deep learning models of places in Indonesian. There are more than 16K images collected and augmented to build the places (specifically places in Indonesia) dataset. The highest accuracy score achieved by the models is 92%. © 2019 The Authors.

But, if there is a spatial effect in the data, it must use a spatial model. This is because the independent variables that influence dependent variable can be different at each location. Spatial autoregressive (SAR) model is a spatial method that can be used to describe the relationship between dependent variable and independent variables by considering spatial impact. Before SAR model is carried out, it must be tested for spatial effect using Moran's I. This is used to ensure that there are spatial effect in the data. Because if there is no spatial effect, then can be use a global model, that is linear regression model using Ordinary Least Square (OLS). In this paper, OLS and SAR model was used on average expenditure data of Papua. Expenditures must be made by each region in Indonesia due to subsidies from the central government. Papua is a province that has the highest average expenditure compared to other provinces. Therefore, the average expenditure becomes important thing that needs to be considered by the government of Papua. This is because there must be equal distribution of expenditure at each district / city in Papua. The result of this research indicated that there is a spatial effect on the average expenditure data in Papua. Comparison result of OLS model and SAR model showed that SAR model is better than OLS model. Because MAPE, AIC and RMSE of SAR model are smaller than OLS. © 2019 The Authors.

There are still quite a number of problems existed in order to build a human-like chatbot program. Understanding a natural conversation and replying back to the conversation the interlocutors, keeping the conversation flowing naturally is a cumbersome task for a computer. This research aims to design an emotionally realistic chatbot system to enhance the believability of the chatbot using Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) and Information State. The results show that there is a statistically significant improvement to the chatbot believability in the system that has emotions variables induced compare to the one without emotions.

The application can benefit to many problems in the world. For example: recognising text in documents, classifying the text or scripts of documents, plate recognition, etc. Many researchers have been developed the methods for recognising characters in by using Optical Character Recognition methods. Although text recognition problem using Optical Character Recognition has been more or less solved, most of the Optical Character Recognition problem explored is belong to Latin alphabet texts. Meanwhile, there are several languages have non-Latin scripts as the written text. Recognising a non-Latin script is quite challenging as the contour and shape of the text are relatively different with a Latin script text. This research aims to collect datasets for OCR in Javanese characters. A total of 5880 characters were collected and trained with several methods with Tesseract OCR tools. The models then be implemented to a mobile phone (Android based). The highest accuracy (97,50%) achieved by the model was achieved by combining single boundary box for the whole parts of the character and the separate boundary boxes in main body and sandangan parts. © 2019 The Authors.

There are several methods exist to enhance the player's experiences in the games. One of the unexplored methods is a dynamic balancing system using Facial Expression Recognition. The player's facial expression is captured in real-time while the player is playing the game, and the dynamic balancing system will automatically adjust the game difficulty based on the player's facial expressions. This research aims to empirically explore the implementation of Facial Expression Recognition for a dynamic balancing system to enhance the player's experiences in the game. Two action games (2D and 3D) were developed and evaluated with 60 respondents in two groups. Both groups played the game twice, one with facial expression recognition system as dynamic balancing activated and one without. The results demonstrate that they are statistically significant differences (i.e. improvement) between the baseline and enhanced games with p < 0.01. © 2019 The Authors.

Most of the available datasets usually focus on either static expression, a short video of changing emotion from neutral to peak emotion, or difference in sounds to detect the current emotion of a person. Moreover, the common datasets were collected and processed in the United States (US) or Europe, and only several datasets were originated from Asia. In this paper, we present our effort to create a unique dataset that can fill in the gap by currently available datasets. At the time of writing, our datasets contain 10 full HD (1920×1080) video clips with annotated JSON file, which is in total 100 minutes of duration and the total size of 13 GB.

The grand purpose of our research is to deliver important medical aids for patients in emergency situations. The case can be simplified into delivery of an item from start to the goal position. We will exploit the drone technology for transporting items efficiently. In sending process, our drone must detect the object target, where the items will be delivered. Therefore, we need object detection module that can detect what is in video stream and where the object is by using GPS as well. To implement the module, we use combination of MobileNet and the Single Shot Detector (SSD) framework for fast and efficient deep learning-based method to object detection. The ability of deep learning to detect and localize specific objects is studied by conducting experiments using drone camera and, as comparison, using stereo camera Minoru. © 2018 IEEE.","deep learning; delivery problem; drone; MobileNet; object detection; SSD","Aircraft detection; Cameras; Drones; Object detection; Object recognition; Stereo image processing; Target drones; Delivery problems; Emergency situation; Learning-based methods; MobileNet; Quadcopter; Single shots; Stereo cameras; Deep learning",,,,,,"Bengio, Y., Courville, A., Vincent, P., Representation learning: A review and new perspectives (2013) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 35 (8), pp. 1798-1828; Budiharto, W., Robust vision-based detection and grasping object for manipulator using sift keypoint detector (2014) International Conference on Advanced Mechatronic Systems (ICAMechS 2014), pp. 448-452. , Japan; Yeremia, H., Yuwono, N.A., Raymond, P., Budiharto, W., Genetic algorithm and neural network for optical character recognition (2013) Journal of Computer Science, pp. 1435-1442; Deep Learning, , https://towardsdatascience.com/deeplearning-2-f81ebe632d5c; Parrot AR Drone, , https://www.parrot.com/global/drones; Bengio, Y., Learning deep architectures for ai (pdf) (2009) Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning, 2 (1), pp. 1-127; Zhou, B., Lapedriza, A., Xiao, J., Torralba, A., Oliva, A., Learning deep features for scene recognition using places database (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 487-495; Socher, R., Huval, B., Bath, B., Manning, C.D., Ng, A.Y., Convolutional-recursive deep learning for 3d object classification (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 656-664; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1097-1105; Qi, C.R., Su, H., Mo, K., Guibas, L.J., Pointnet: Deep learning on point sets for 3d classification and segmentation (2017) Proc.

This paper proposes a dataset which consists of natural dyadic conversation in Indonesian language. Where literature suggested that there are exists inadequate number of conversation dataset in Indonesian Language. There are 3164 words (formal and slang (informal nonstandard words) annotated from the recording of five groups, with the largest number of words belong to Food topic (Group 3, 826 words), and the lowest one belongs to Travelling topic (Group 2, 372 words).

Research has shown that players generally express their emotions when playing the game. This allow us to capture the player's expression from their face and use it to dynamically adjust the game difficulties. A preliminary study was conducted to capture what kind of game that would be suitable to test dynamic balancing. The game with a dynamic balancing system then was developed using Scrum methodology as the software development methodology. Furthermore, the dynamic balancing in the game was simulated in the computer and evaluated, with some of items from Immersive Experience Questionnaire, with players played two versions of game, one with dynamic balancing activated and the other with-out dynamic balancing activated. The results evidently show that there was some statistically significant enhancement in the game with Facial Expression Recognition activated as a game dynamic game balancing compare to the one with-out Facial Expression Recognition. © 2018 The Author(s).","Dynamic Balancing; Facial Expression Recognition; Immersive Experience Questionnaire; Player Experience","Artificial intelligence; Balancing machines; Face recognition; Software design; Surveys; Dynamic balancing; Dynamic game; Facial expression recognition; Immersive; Player experience; Scrum methodologies; Software development methodologies; Computer games",,,,,,"Lazzaro, N., (2004) Why We Play Games: Four Keys to More Emotion Without Story; Suryani, D., Ekaputra, V., Chowanda, A., Multi-modal asian conversation mobile video dataset for recognition task (2018) International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE), 8 (5); Andrade, G., Ramalho, G., Gomes, A.S., Corruble, V., Dynamic game balancing: An evaluation of user satisfaction (2006) AIIDE, 6, pp. 3-8; Sutoyo, R., Winata, D., Oliviani, K., Supriyadi, D.M., Dynamic difficulty adjustment in tower defence (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 435-444; Jennett, C., Cox, A.L., Cairns, P., Dhoparee, S., Epps, A., Tijs, T., Measuring and defining the experience of immersion in games (2008) International Journal of Human-computer Studies, 66 (9), pp. 641-661; Brockmyer, J.H., Fox, C.M., Curtiss, K.A., McBroom, E., Burkhart, K.M., Pidruzny, J.N., The development of the game engagement questionnaire: A measure of engagement in video game-playing (2009) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 45 (4), pp. 624-634; Chowanda, A., Flintham, M., Blanchfield, P., Valstar, M., Playing with social and emotional game companions (2016) International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents, pp. 85-95; Suttichaya, V., Desktop tower defense is np-hard (2016) Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 19-25. , Springer; Prasetio, Y.L., Wijaya, R., Sjah, M.P., Christian, M.R., Chowanda, A., Location-based game to enhance players experience in survival horror game (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 116, pp. 206-213; Want, R., Hopper, A., Falcao, V., Gibbons, J., The active badge location system (1992) ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), 10 (1), pp. 91-102; Chowanda, A., Blanchfield, P., Flintham, M., Valstar, M., Erisa: Building emotionally realistic social game-agents companions (2014) International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents, pp. 134-143; Chowanda, A., Blanchfield, P., Flintham, M., Valstar, M., Play smile game with erisa (2015) IVA 2015, Fifteenth International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents; Chowanda, A., Blanchfield, P., Flintham, M., Valstar, M., Computational models of emotion, personality, and social relationships for interactions in games (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Autonomous Agents & Multiagent Systems.

That conventional payment method can be inefficient and ineffective for customers. Hence, the objective of this research is to analyze what would be the potential factors influencing customers in Jakarta especially who already have e-Money as prepaid product when making decisions whether using e-Money for their micro transactions payment. In this research, we implement qualitative methods using Focus Group Discussion and semi-structured interview. The respondents were from all over Jakarta. Through Focus Group Discussion and interview, we studied and obtained a better understanding about consumer attitude towards e-Money as prepaid product in their daily life. Finally, we provide suggestions for decision makers in both, banks, business people and local government to increase the number of both, users and micro payments using e-Money based on the analysis results. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

With the GPS technology, the player can play in a real world as well as in the virtual game world. We postulate this thus will enhance the player's experience. To test the hypothesis, a horror game genre with location-based features was developed. The game was evaluated to thirty participants. The results demonstrate the game allowed the participants to explore a new place with fun. In addition, the participants claimed that the game allow them to enjoy a new experience in playing horror game. The participants described that playing the game was giving them more tension compare to playing a conventional horror game. Moreover, the participants claimed that they feel more familiar with the place they've explored during the game. Finally, some improvements could be done to improve the experience enhancement to the game. First, more variation in the storyline, quests and the enemy. As the game evaluated in this paper is served only as a prototype, the variation of the storyline, quests and the enemy (i.e. The ghost) is limited. © 2017 The Authors.

The models can be used by decision makers in a company to develop a strategy (e.g. marketing, products development) based on the prediction results. We evaluate the model using our datasets of Facebook. We collected the data by utilising Facebook API. Furthermore, we implemented a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) algorithm to the datasets to provide a dynamic prediction of customers' purchase behaviours over time. In the preliminary evaluation, we implemented our model to the datasets with t=2. In our datasets, we found that the category, electronics, was the most favourite topic to discuss, share and like regarding electronics. Interestingly, we found that a positive direction for its trend appeared in the second run of the model. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Computational prediction model; Customer purchase behaviour; Facebook datasets; Hidden Markov Model; Strategic management",,,,,,,"Catanese, S., De Meo, P., Ferrara, E., Fiumara, G., Provetti, A., Extraction and analysis of Facebook friendship relations (2012) Computational Social Networks, pp. 291-324. , In A.

This trend is making people do activities on their smartphone such as exchange information, playing games, paying bills, discussing ideas, etc. In almost every smartphone, security features (i.e. password, pin, face unlock) are already built in which are intended to protect the data inside the smartphone. Nevertheless, those security features are not perfect and have flaws either technically or by human errors. This research aim to provide an application that uses people' facial expressions to improve the security of smartphone, namely Android. We implement face detection and expression recognition in this application as an improvement from the existing unlock screen, which is face unlock. The results that are achieved from this research is an unlock screen application on Android devices that utilizes people' facial expression changes to open their smartphone. This application can eliminates the technical errors from existing face unlock screen application which can be deceived by photos. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.","Biometric; Face expression recognition; Unlock screen","Android (operating system); Biometrics; Face recognition; Manufacture; Security systems; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Android smartphone; Application design; Expression recognition; Face expression recognition; Face expressions; Facial Expressions; Security features; Technical errors; Mobile security",,,,,,"Ahmad, F., Najam, A., Ahmed, Z., Image-based Face detection and recognition: ""state of the art (2012) IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, 9 (6), pp. 169-172. , no. 1; Dashore, G., Raj, V.C., An efficient method for face recognition using principal component analysis (2012) International Journal of Advanced Technnology & Engineering Research, II, 2, pp. 23-28; Saudagare, P.V., Chaudhari, D.S., Facial expression recognition using neural network-An overview (2012) International Journal of Soft Computing and Engineering (IJSCE), 2 (1), pp. 224-227; Baggio, D.L., (2012) Mastering OpenCV with Practical Computer Vision Projects, , Packt Publishing; Jiang, B., Valstar, M.F., Martinez, B., Pantic, M., A dynamic appearance descriptor approach to facial actions temporal modelling (2014) IEEE Transactions of Systems, Man and Cybernetics-Part B, 44 (2), pp. 161-174. , 2011 and; Tan, X., Triggs, B., Enhanced local texture feature sets for face recognition under difficult lighting conditions (2010) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 19, pp. 1635-1650; Valstar, M.F., Pantic, M., Fully automatic recognition of the temporal phases of facial actions (2012) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, 42 (1), pp. 28-43; Jiang, B., Valstar, M.F., Pantic, M., Action Unit detection using sparse appearance descriptors in space-time video volumes (2011) IEEE int'L.

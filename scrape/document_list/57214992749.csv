The implementation of NPG is part of Indonesia's nationalist development strategy, therefore Bank BCA as one of the Anchor Banks in Indonesia has a very strategic role in implementing this policy.

The results of this study are as follows: (1) Identifying problems in NPG implementation (2) Building NPG models and conditions for companies using the theory of Resource Based View, Value Chain, Factor Analysis and VRIO (3) Planning the company's competitive advantage strategy in implementing NPG. © 2020 IEEE.","Competitive advantage; Implementation model; Management strategy; National payment gateway","Information management; Banking industry; Competitive advantage; Development strategies; Economic system; Payment gateways; Resource-based view; Strategic role; Strategy modeling; Competition",,,,,"Holloway, S.S., Eijnatten Van, F.M., Georges, A., Romme, L., Demerouti, E., Developing actionable knowledge on value crafting: A design science approach (2016) Journal of Business ResearchVolume, 69 (5), pp. 1639-1643. , May 2016; Zafirovski, M., Exploitation in contemporary societies: An exploratory comparative analysis (2019) The Social Science Journal, 56 (4), pp. 565-587. , December 2019; Prévost, B., Rivaud, A., The world bank's environmental strategies: Assessing the influence of a biased use of new institutional economics on legal issues (2018) Ecosystem Services, 29, pp. 370-380. , February 2018; Adams, P., Maria Bodas Freitas, I., Fontana, R., Strategic orientation, innovation performance and the moderating influence of marketing management (2019) Journal of Business Research, 97, pp. 129-140. , April 2019; Kline, P., (2014) An Easy Guide to Factor Analysis, , Routledge Taylor & Francis Group London; Otho, H., (2018) Nation and Character Building, , https://www.bappenas.go.id/id/data-dan-informasiutama/makalah/artikel-majalah-perencanaan/edisi-32-tahun-2003/nation-and-character-building-melalui-pemahaman-wawasankebangsaan-oleh-otho-h-hadi, accessed on October 1 2018; Hui-Wen, T., Anlin, C., How do market power and industry competition influence the effect of corporate governance on earnings management?

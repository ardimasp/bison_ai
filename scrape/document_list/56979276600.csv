OJS is an open-source journal management platform that provides a streamlined journal publishing workflow. TextRank is an unsupervised, graph-based ranking model commonly used as extractive auto summarization of text documents. This study applies the TextRank algorithm to summarize 50 article reviews from an OJS-based international journal. The resulting summaries are formed using the most representative sentences extracted from the reviews. The summaries are then used to help OJS editors in assessing a review's quality. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Graphic methods; Information services; Publishing; Graph based rankings; International journals; Journal publishing; Management platforms; Open sources; Text document; Reviews",,,,,"Edgar, B.D., Willinsky, J., A survey of the scholarly journals using Open Journal Systems (2010) Sch.

The methods used include the method of analysis in the form of literature and field studies to observe the activities of the running system, interviews with stakeholders, user surveys and design method using the Unified Modelling Language, and design the system architecture and features. The result of this research is the development of the library system by implementing an integrated flow of circulation of books between libraries. The conclusions of this research is toimplement an integrated book circulationbetween libraries, then the inter-library loan can be done in an integrated manner. © 2015 The Authors.

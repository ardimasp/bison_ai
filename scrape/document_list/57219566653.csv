XYZ This is due to the number of bugs in the e-commerce system at PT. XYZ Some products cannot enter the shopping design page; there are no features that should be available in e-commerce systems such as shipping costs. An e-commerce system with a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach is needed to overcome these problems. The results of the study found that several web services can be combined into one part to help the development process become better and easier. © 2020 IEEE.","E-Commerce; Service Oriented Architecture; SOMA; Web Services","Electronic commerce; Information management; Information services; Product design; Program debugging; Web services; Development process; E-commerce systems; One parts; Shipping cost; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,,,"Appandairaj, A., Murugappan, S., Service oriented architecture design for web based home banking systems with cloud based service (2013) Int.

The main objective of this study is how to find the factors that influence the behavior of lecturers when receiving and using the LMS. This study uses the UTAUT 2 and Trust method to identify the factors that influence the acceptance and use of LMS for university lecturers. The data was collected and analyzed using SEM-PLS. The results of this study indicate that performance expectancy, habit and trust have the significant influence on the acceptance of the application (behavioral intention), while habit and behavioral intention are the influential factor in the use of the application (use behaviour). © 2019 IEEE.","learning management system; SEM-PLS; teaching learning process; trust; university; UTAUT2","Information management; Learning management system; Teaching-learning process; trust; university; UTAUT2; Learning systems",,,,,"Adzharuddin, N.A., Hwei Ling, L., Learning management system (lms) among university students: Does it work?

The abundance amount of available data has become a unique challenge for the organisation to manage and process its data to be more useful information. The concept of processing large amounts of data that do not interfere the operational data is called 'Data Warehouse' technology. Data warehouse serves as the basis to build an executive dashboard application that could assist the board of leadership in universities to access information in visual form to accelerate and improve the readability of the information itself. The developers of Executive Dashboard should meet what the board of leadership needs and stick to the information system architecture based that university has. This development method utilizes Key Performance Indicator approach owned by the university. To build a proper executive dashboard, developers need data warehouse that is built through the initial stage of system development life cycle for the data warehouse. Since it is applied to universities, this executive dashboard application is called as the University Dashboard. © 2014 IEEE.","data warehouse; executive dashboard; key performance indicators (KPI); university dashboard","Data warehouses; Decision making; Life cycle; Waste disposal; Competitive markets; Decision making process; executive dashboard; Information system architecture; Key performance indicators; Large amounts of data; System development life cycles; university dashboard; Benchmarking",,,,,"Zagorecki, A., Ristvej, J., Comfort, L.K., Lovecek, T., Executive dashboard systems for emergency management (2012) Communication Review, 2, pp. 82-89; Garrett, G., How to create a business intelligence strategy (2012) SAS Global Forum 2012, Applied Business Intelligence, pp. 1-8; Velcu-Laitinen, O., Yigitbasioglu, O.M., The use of dashboards in performance management: Evidence from sales managers (2012) The International Journal of Digital Accounting Research, 12, pp. 39-58. , March; Cui, Z., Damiani, E., Leida, M., Benefits of ontologies in real time data access (2007) Digital EcoSystems and Technologies Conference, DEST '07, pp. 392-397. , Inaugural, IEEE-IES, 21-23 February; Dennis, A., Haley Wixom, B., Tegarden, D., (2009) Systems Analysis and Design with UML 2.0 An Object-Oriented Approach, , 3rd edition John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Turban, E., Aronson, J.E., Liang, T., Sharda, R., (2007) Decision Support and Business Intelligence System, p. 209. , 8th edition, Prentice Hall; David, F.R., (2011) Strategic Management Concepts and Cases, , Thirteenth edition, Prentice Hall; Stackowiak, R., Rayman, J., Greenwald, R., (2007) Oracle Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence Solutions, , Wiley Publishing, Inc, Indianapolis; Sauter, V.L., (2010) Decision Support System for Business Intelligence, p. 400. , Second edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Inmon, W.H., (2005) Building the Data Warehouse, p. 21. , Fourth Edition, Wiley publishing Inc; Profil Perguruan Tinggi, , http://forlap.dikti.go.id/, DIKTI, [Online], accessed on January 26th, 2014 - 17.16 pm","Meyliana; School of Information Systems, Bina Nusantara UniversityIndonesia",,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2nd International Conference on Information and Communication Technology, ICoICT 2014","28 May 2014 through 30 May 2014",,114769,,9781479935819,,,"English","Int.

EB Connect is a web portal to support business activities, particularly sales process. The method used is the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which will be inserted to SmartPLS to help the calculation. Analysis based on the users' survey resulted measurements of each indicators of the TAM model. The study identified insignicant factors within TAM that alters actual use of the system, which are External Variables to Perceived Ease of Use (E), Perceived Ease of Use (E) to Perceived Usefulness (U), Perceived Ease of Use (U) to Attitude Toward Using (A), Attitude Toward Using (A) to Behavioral Intention to Use (BI) and Behavioral Intention to Use (BI) to Actual System Use. Meanwhile, there are insignificant relation which are External Variables to Perceived Usefulness (U), Perceived Usefulness (U) to Behavioral Intention to Use (BI) and Perceived Ease of Use (E) to Attitude Toward Using (A). The study found the problems causing the insignificant relationare due to product sold within the portal does not meet user requirements, lack of user socialization and training to use the portal, and server problems. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Information system; SmartPLS; TAM","Information systems; Analysis and evaluation; Behavioral intention; Business activities; Perceived ease of use; Perceived usefulness; SmartPLS; Technology acceptance model; User requirements; Portals",,,,,"Davis, F., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and user acceptance of information technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3), p. 319; Hanggono, A.A., Handayani, S.R., Susilo, H., (2015) Analisis Atas Praktek TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) Dalam Mendukung Bisnis Online Dengan Memanfaatkan Jejaring Sosial Instagram, p. 26; Mazhar, F., Rizwan, M., Fiaz, U., Ishrat, S., Razzaq, M.S., Khan, T.N., (2014) An Investigation of Factors Affecting Usage and Adoption of Internet &mobile Banking in Pakistan; Sugiyono, (2011) Metode Penelitian Kuantitatif Dan Kualitatif Dan R&D; Roscoe, J.T., (1975) Fundamental Research Statistics for the Behavioral Science","Heriprayoco, S.; Information Systems Department, Indonesia; email: hpracoyo@binus.edu",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Eco Engineering Development, ICEED 2019","13 November 2019 through 14 November 2019",,158437,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The specimens used in this research are made from a reinforced concrete beam with its dimension is 100 mm width times 150 mm height and f/ c= 18 MPa. The beam has 2#2 tension reinforcement lie at the bottom of the beam, and 2#2 reinforcement lie at the upper side of the beam to maintain the position of shear reinforcement. Shear reinforcement provide by φ4 mm steel reinforcement spaced every 150 mm 200 mm at the middle of the beam. This shear reinforcement area fulfill minimum limit ratio specified in ACI 318-08. The test results indicated that no significant differences for shear capacity from each types of shear reinforcement cross section. But open stirrups can be considered as a practical use in the construction field. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Beam; Deflection; Reinforced concrete; Shear reinforcement; Tension reinforcement",,,,,,"(2008) Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete (ACI 318-08) and Comentary, , ACI Committee 318.

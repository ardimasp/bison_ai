The identification of the type of engine by the sound is not an easy task, even for the professionals. An intelligent system that can identify V6 to V8 engines from various cars will give an insight of the features in the engine sounds that characterized the two different engines. In this work, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach is applied for identifying cylinder of the engine based on the engine sound identification is proposed. The recorded sound of the engine is then processed in order to get some features which later be used in the proposed system. The Fast Fourir Transform (FFT) is adopted as a feature and later used as input to the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based identifier. The Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent automatic six cylinder and eight cylinder engine based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), since it resulting the training and testing accuracy of 100 % and 100 %, respectively. © 2019 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.","Automatics petrol identification; Fast fourier transform; Support vector machine","Fast Fourier transforms; Integrated circuits; Intelligent systems; Manufacture; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Cylinder engines; Naturally aspirated; Sound detection; Sound identification; Training and testing; Turbocharged engine; Engine cylinders",,,,,"(2017) What Does the Fourth Industrial Revolution Mean for Regional Economic Integration ?, , https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/379401/asean-fourth-industrial-revolution-rci.pdf, Asean Development Bank.

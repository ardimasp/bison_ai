In this study, the operator's work posture analysis, as well as an evaluation of three main production activities at the petrochemical company in Qatar, were conducted. The main objective is to assess the risks carried out by panel & field operators. This assessment is important to maintain the operator's productivity within the industrial system context. A Nordic questionnaire was applied to collect information on Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) symptoms from 34 operators, while Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) and Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) was utilized to analyze risks of work postures. How operators perceived their workload was also evaluated using NASA-TLX. About 79% of operators suffered from shoulder pain, 70% suffered a waist disorder as a symptom of MSDs, and it can cause disrupted productivity in the long run. The operators' posture during performing their tasks was identified as a high level of risk and requires immediate action based on RULA and REBA scores. To reduce MSDs symptoms and posture risk scores, a portable platform and handle wheel chain was proposed. Based on NASA-TLX result the operators perceived that workload as somewhat high to high with score 49-60 on average (scale 1-100). Addition outsourced personnel was suggested to decrease the workload level in a certain operation. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Ethylene Dichloride; musculoskeletal disorders; Nasa-TLX; Nordic questionnaire; REBA; RULA","Aliphatic compounds; Diseases; Ethylene; Musculoskeletal system; NASA; Petrochemicals; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Polyols; Productivity; Surveys; Ethylene dichloride; Musculoskeletal disorders; NASA-TLX; Nordic questionnaire; REBA; RULA; Risk assessment",,,,,"Lock, F., Hansson, G., Nogueira, H.C., Enquist, H., Holtermann, A., Oliveira, A.N., Biomechanical exposure of industrial workers-influence of automation process (2018) International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, 67, pp. 41-52; Abdullah, N.H., Hamid, N.A.A., Wahab, E., Shamsuddin, A., Asmawi, R., Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorder (WRMD) among Production Operators: Studies of Differences in Age and Gender (2017) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1049; Al-Qaisi, S., Aghazadeh, F., The effects of valve-handwheel height and angle on neck, shoulder, and back muscle loading (2018) International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, 64, pp. 69-78; Alasim, H.N., Nimbarte, A.D., Jaridi, M., Impact of pulling direction and magnitude of force exertion on the activation of shoulder muscles (2019) International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, 69, pp. 14-22; Al Thani, A., Mohammad, S.A., Alam, W.M., (2009) Heat Stress Guidelines & Recommendation Heat Stress Pevention and Management Workshop, , http://www.ashghal.gov.qa/en/Documents/ADs/Current%20ADs/Heat%20Stress/HeatStress_E.pdf; Hart, S.G., Nasa-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX); 20 Years Later (2006) Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting, 50; Nurmianto, E., Ciptomulyo, U., Suparno, Kromodihardjo, S., Manual handling problem identification in mining industry: An Ergonomic perspective (2015) Procedia Manufacturing, 4, pp. 89-97; Rmd, Z., Azis, N.A., Saptari, A., Kamat, S.R., A Survey on Working Postures among Malaysian Industrial Workers (2015) Procedia Manufacturing, 2, pp. 450-459; Lakhwinder, P.S., (2016) Work Study and Ergonomic: Work Posture Assessment Using Rapid Entire Body Assessment Tool (REBA); Middlesworth, M., (2017) A Step by Step Guide to the REBA Assessment Tool.

It can be classified into several types, such as unacceptable dimensions, defects on the material, and others. However, due to the various factors that may cause the defect, it is not easy to pinpoint what actually causes the defect on the products. By using a decision tree, it is easier to determine the root cause of each defect as well as providing fast-response solution for each case. In the Quality Control (QC) department of a grinding wheel manufacturing company, the QC staffs need to answer some questions about the characteristics of the products. The decision tree certainly will help to find the root cause and it also generates the action for solving the problems. At the end of the session, the staff will get the decision whether the product can be accepted or should be destroyed. © 2018 IEEE.","decision tree; defect; quality control","Decision trees; Defects; Information management; Product design; Defect classification; Design faults; Fast response; Manufacturing companies; Product defects; Root cause; Quality control",,,,,"Bak, B., Batmaz, I., Göntörkön, F.A., Köksal, I.A.I.G., Özdemirel, N.E., (2008) Defect Cause Modeling with Decision Tree and Regression Analysis, 2 (12), pp. 1334-1337; Rokach, L., Maimon, O., (2014) Data Mining with Decision Trees, 81; Tan, P.-N., Steinbach, M., Kumar, V., Classification : Basic concepts , decision trees (2006) Introd.To Data Min, 67 (17), pp. 145-205; Venkatasubramaniam, A., Wolfson, J., Mitchell, N., Barnes, T., Jaka, M., French, S., Decision trees in epidemiological research (2017) Emerg.

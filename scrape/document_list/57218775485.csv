Trust is an important factor for the parties involved in raising these funds, both in terms of the funder, the service provider of fundraising platform and even the fundraiser. On this occasion, the author tries to analyze how to implement blockchain technology and smart contracts in the dominant schemes of crowdfunding process. the results of this study indicate that blockchain-based smart contracts can be applied to the dominant schemes of crowdfunding process. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

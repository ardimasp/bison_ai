Its purpose was to determine the correlation between independent variables consisting of Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Attitude toward Using (AU) with dependent variable Behavioral Intention to Use (BIU). Data collection techniques were carried out by distributing questionnaires through group discussion forums. Respondents consisted of medical workers and health cadres both in Jakarta and Yogyakarta. Data were analyzed using correlation test and t-test. The results of the correlation test state that the correlation between PEU and AU is 0.30, which shows a weak correlation. Meanwhile, the correlation of PU and AU is 0.56, PEU and BIU is 0.41, and PU and BIU is 0.47, which are considered as moderate correlations. Finally, a strong correlation exists between AU and BIU. T-test results show that the effect of PU on AU is statistically significant with CI = 95%. Likewise, the effects of PEU on AU, AU towards BIU, PU towards BIU, and PEU towards BIU are significant (p < 0.05). © Kassel University Press GmbH.","Cancer early detection; Mobile learning; TAM",,,,,,"Dyanti, G.A.R., Suariyani, N.L.P., Faktor-Faktor Keterlambatan Penderita Kanker Payudara Dalam Melakukan Pemeriksaan Awal Ke Pelayanan Kesehatan (2016) Jurnal Kesehatan Masyarakat, 11 (2), pp. 96-104. , https://doi.org/10.15294/kemas.v11i2.3742; Muljo, H.H., Perbangsa, A.S., Pardamean, B., Assessment of Online Learning Application for Health Education (2019) International Journal of Online and Biomedical Engineering, 15 (12), pp. 69-80. , https://doi.org/10.3991/ijoe.v15i12.11157; Setiati, E., (2009) Waspadai Empat Kanker Ganas Pembunuh Wanita, Kanker Rahim, Kanker Indung Telur, Kanker Leher Rahim, Kanker Payudara, , https://doi.org/10.18860/sains.v0i0.1862, Yokyakarta: Andi; Fernández, M.E., DeBor, M., Candreia, J.D.M., Dissemination of a breast and cervical cancer early detection program through a network of community-based organizations (2010) Health Promotion Practice, 11 (5), pp. 654-664. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839908325064; Ngoc Nguyen, T.-U., Tanjasiri, S.P., Kagawa-Singer, M., Tran, J.H., Foo, M.A., Community Health Navigators for Breast-and Cervical-Cancer Screening Among Cambodian and Laotian Women: Intervention Strategies and Relationship-Building Processes (2008) Health Promotion Practice, 9 (4), pp. 356-367. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839906290251; Muljo, H.H., Pardamean, B., Perbangsa, A.S., The implementation of online learning for early detection of cervical cancer (2017) Journal of Computer Science, 13 (11), pp. 600-607. , https://doi.org/10.3844/jcssp.2017.600.607; Davis, F.D., Perceived Usefullness, Perceived Ease of Use, and User Acceptance of Information Technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3). , https://doi.org/10.2307/249008; Quinn, C., (2000) MLearning, , Mobile, Wireless, In-Your-Pocket Learning.

The development of health knowledge can be disseminated by utilizing mobile application based learning technology as media. Many things have been done by the government through special programs, among others, carried out breast cancer awareness campaign through breast self-screening program. The positive impact of this effort has led to mobile applications for learning about early detection of cancer in Indonesia. The development of mobile learning is a continuation of previous online learning to help the process of early detection of cervical cancer. Data collection methods used observation, interview, and questionnaire techniques, while instructional designs use the ADDIE (Analysis Design Development Implementation Evaluations) model and methods for developing object-oriented programming systems using Unified Modeling Language (UML). The resulting output is the application of early detection of cancer-based mobile learning which is the virtue of this study. © 2018, International Association of Online Engineering.","Cancer; Early detection; Mobile learning",,,,,,"Huang, Y.-M., Hwang, W.-Y., Chang, K.-E., Guest Editorial-Innovations in Designing Mobile Learning Applications (2010) Educational Technology & Society, 13 (3), pp. 1-2; Spector, J.M., (2013) Foundations of educational technology: Integrative approaches and interdisciplinary perspectives, , Routledge; Quinn, C.N., (2011) Designing mLearning: Tapping into the mobile revolution for organizational performance, p. 256. , San Francisco: Pfeiffer; Alsaadat, K., Mobile Learning and University Teaching (2009) International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN09), , Barcelona, Spain; Vinu, P.V., Sherimon, P.C., Krishnan, R., 'Towards pervasive mobile learning-the vision of 21st century' (2011) Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, 15, pp. 3067-3073. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.04.247; Yuen, S., Wang, S., M-learning: Mobility in Learning (2004) Proceedings of E-Learn 2004-World Conference on E-Learning in Corporate, Government, Healthcare, and Higher Education, pp. 2248-2252. , In J.

The research purpose is to implement a gaze tracking application so that people know which part of a wide view target is the most interesting. This research uses Kinect Xbox 360 as a tracking device and Visual Studio 2013 as development environment (IDE). The research can be applied in business purpose, such as in advertisement area. This research uses the source code of Face tracking from Microsoft Kinect SDK to get drawings of face models. Furthermore the source code is modified to determine gaze of a person. There are several scenarios used to supervise experiment result with help of volunteers. The research results between 70-80% accuracy in practical experiment scenarios (ideal condition) and 50-60% in real experiment scenario. © Research India Publications.","Facetracking; Gaze tracking; Head pose estimation; Kinect SDK; Point of interest",,,,,,"Funes Mora, K.A., Odobez, J., Gaze estimation from multimodal kinect data (2012) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), 2012 IEEE Computer Society Conference On, p. 2530; Stanley, D., (2013) Measuring Attention Using Microsoft Kinect; Khoshelham, K., Elberink, S.O., Accuracy and resolution of kinect depth data for indoor mapping applications (2012) Sensors, 12, pp. 1437-1454; Zhang, Z., Microsoft kinect sensor and its effect (2012) Multimedia, IEEE, 19, pp. 4-10; O’Roarty, B., McGreal, S., Adair, A., The impact of retailers' store selection criteria on the estimation of retail rents (1997) Journal of Property Valuation and Investment, 15, pp. 119-130; Kiefer, P., Giannopoulos, I., Kremer, D., Schlieder, C., Raubal, M., Starting to get bored: An outdoor eye tracking study of tourists (2014) Eye Tracking & Research Applications Symposium; Lange, C., Yoo, J.-W., Wohlfarter, M., Bubb, H., (2006) Dikablis (Digital Wireless Gaze Tracking System)- Operation Mode and Evaluation of the Human Machine Interaction, 2006, pp. 121-129; Li, Y., Monaghan, D.S., O’Connor, N.E., RealTime Gaze Estimation using a Kinect and a HD Webcam (2014) Multi Media Modelling; Bolles, R.C., Fischler, M.A., A RANSAC-Based Approach to Model Fitting and Its Application to Finding Cylinders in Range Data (1981) IJCAI, pp. 637-643; Xiong, X., Cai, Q., Liu, Z., Zhang, Z., Eye Gaze Tracking Using an RGBD Camera: A Comparison with a RGB Solution (2014) Ubicomp, , Seattle; Fanelli, G., Gall, J., Van Gool, L., Real time head pose estimation with random regression forests (2011) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2011 IEEE Conference On, pp. 617-624; Ham, J., Chen, Y., Crawford, M.M., Ghosh, J., Investigation of the random forest framework for classification of hyperspectral data (2005) Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions On, 43, pp. 492-501; Breitenstein, M.D., Kuettel, D., Weise, T., Van Gool, L., Pfister, H., Real-time face pose estimation from single range images,"" in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2008.

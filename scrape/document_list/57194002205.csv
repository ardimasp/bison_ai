Compression in the storage or file-systems layer has not been widely adopted for OLTP database because of the concern that it might decrease database performance. OLTP compression in the database layer is available commercially but it has a significant licence cost that reduces the cost saving of compression. In this research, transparent file-system compression with LZ4, LZJB and ZLE algorithm have been tested to improve performance of OLTP application. Using Swing-bench as the benchmark tool and Oracle database 12c, The result indicated that on OLTP workload, LZJB was the most optimal compression algorithm with performance improvement up to 49% and consistent reduction of maximum response time and CPU utilisation overhead, while LZ4 was the compression with the highest compression ratio and ZLE was the compression with the lowest CPU utilisation overhead. In terms of compression ratio, LZ4 can deliver the highest compression ratio which is 5.32, followed by LZJB, 4.92; and ZLE, 1.76. Furthermore, it is found that there is indeed a risk of reduced performance and/or an increase of maximum response time. © 2017 Penerbit UTM Press.

Beside the database performance, we also compare how much storage can be saved, impact to maximum response time, and the increase of CPU utilization from the three compression algorithms. The acquired data were then be analyzed using Analytic Hierarchy Process to find out the highest ranking compression in terms of benefits and benefits to cost ratio. The result indicates that LZJB achieved the highest performance improvement, LZ4 achieved the highest storage saving and ZLE achieved the smallest CPU utilization overhead. The safest algorithm that did not experience any reduction in database performance or increase of maximum response time in this research is LZJB. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Compression; Filesystems layer; OLTP database; Performance","Compaction; Database systems; Digital storage; File organization; Online systems; Response time (computer systems); Compression algorithms; CPU utilization; Database performance; File systems; Filesystems layer; Maximum response time; Online transaction processing; Performance; Benchmarking",,,,,"Bassiouni, M.A., Data compression in scientific and statistical databases (1985) IEEE Trans.

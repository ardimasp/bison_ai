It is required for universities to comply with the regulation of the ministry of research, technology, and higher education of the Republic of Indonesia, Number 32 of 2016 on the accreditation of study programs and universities. However, there are many difficulties in analyzing active student reports, additional and ad hoc reports, and the need for business intelligence and data mining development. The purpose of this research is to analyze and design data warehouse to integrate various operational databases needed to provide information about active students at XYZ University. The method of analysis is done by running system analysis and analysis of the running system weaknesses. While the data warehouse design method uses 4 stages (Four-Step Methodology) used by Ralph Kimball in designing a data warehouse. The stages are selecting the business process, declaring grain, identifying the dimensions, and identifying facts. The results achieved are the design of data warehouse and dashboard that will provide relevant and integrated information about active students that can be viewed from different angles. Designed data warehouses are needed to help organizations to analyze information as needed and help management to make strategic decisions. The conclusion is that with the build of a data warehouse to support active student management can help the university to analyze active student and make decisions in the student area. © 2018 IEEE.","dashboard; data warehouse; four-step methodology; strategic","Data mining; Data warehouses; Decision making; Information management; Students; dashboard; four-step methodology; Integrated informations; Method of analysis; Operational database; strategic; Strategic decisions; Student management; Design",,,,,"Santoso, L.W., Analysis of the Impact of Information Technology Investments-A Survey of Indonesian Universities (2014) Petra Christian University; Santoso, L.W., Data Warehouse with Big Data Technology for Higher Education (2017) Procedia Comput.

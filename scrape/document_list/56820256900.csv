There are limited previous empiric researches studied on the effect of social technology adoption towards ambidexterity. We hypothesize that social technology adoption can lead to ambidexterity directly and through rapid absorptive capacity and collectivism-based collaboration. Using quantitative method, this research was conducted to organizations that adopt social technology in various sectors in Indonesia. Data was processed by structural equation modeling (SEM). This research shows that ambidexterity positively affects organizational performance. It also shows that social technology adoption positively affects ambidexterity directly and through rapid absorptive capacity. However, this research does not support the hypothesis that social technology adoption will positively affect ambidexterity through collectivism-based collaboration. This research may give benefits to strategic management literature in finding the robust model to build an ambidextrous organization, especially through social technology adoption. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Absorptive capacity; Organizational ambidexterity; Organizational performance; Social technology",,,,,,"Andriopoulos, C., Lewis, M.W., Exploitation-exploration tensions and organizational ambidexterity: managing paradoxes of innovation (2009) Organization Science, 20 (4), pp. 696-717; Ashurst, C., Freer, A., Ekdahl, J., Gibbons, C., Exploring IT-enabled innovation: a new paradigm?

Since its introduction in year 1990, AC has gained wide popularity for its application in the business world; nevertheless, its application still rare to be found in the vocational schools (known as polytechnics) in Indonesia. In general, the Indonesian polytechnics have lack of AC mechanism in improving their collaboration model with the firms. The article examines the important role of knowledge management (KM) model to improve the AC mechanism inside the state-owned polytechnics. The state-owned polytechnics have mission to support local and national economic corridors, and strengthening the foundation of firms.

We have seen the potential and the promise of AI applications in the financial market for quite a while. However, it is still unclear about the state of the art of AI applications in the financial market today, particularly, with the advancement in machine learning, intelligent agent, and Web 2.0 technologies. This article provides a commentary on the recent advances in machine learning, intelligent agent and other AI techniques in financial market applications, on their successes or failures, and on the future challenges of the machine learning and intelligent agents in the financial market. We observe that utilizing richer data for forecasting market, and developing an integrated framework using Agent-Based Model and Artificial Market for both understanding and forecasting the financial markets would be very promising research areas to pursue. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This study used the stock returns data for 60 days around 50 split events of publicly traded stock on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2010 to 2015. This study found an anomaly pattern of stock prices with the ex-date as the peak and a positive average return that could not be explained by the general market movement. The cross-sectional regression of the conservative capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and three other factors failed in explaining the ex-date return anomalies. The results of the empirical model indicate that ex-date return anomalies were not related to a firm’s operating performance but were strongly related to the split factor, weakly related to trading volume, and also weakly related to the market value. Overall, these findings support the trading range/liquidity hypothesis. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Event study; Market reaction; Stock split",,,,,"Binus University","The authors would like to thank the Management Department of the Binus Business School that always gives full support in areas of research and publication, along with thanks to the Research Technological Transfer Office Department of Binus University that provided the funding for conference registration and travel accommodations.","Brennan, M.

Forensic accounting becomes one of the solutions to detect this fraudulent statement. On the basic of our premise, the purpose of research to explore empirical evidence regarding financial statement fraud detection factors with net worth method as control variable. Our independent variables were debt to equity ratio, change in net assets, and return on asset. The research was quantitatively on food and beverage manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. We use financial statement year end audited from 2013-2017. We used purposive sample, when selecting the samples. Total of 55 company reports samples were used in this research. We analyzed the data using statistical multiple linear regression analysis. We used statistical software to do the regression, in order to answer the research questions and test the hypothesis. Fraudulent reporting fraud was examined using proxies Beneish M-score. After the statistical test, this research concludes that financial distress factor proxy Debt to Equity Ratio (DER) has no significant effect on fraud detection. Other factor that is financial stability was proxies by changes in total assets (ACHANGE), and financial targets in the proxy of Return on Assets (ROA) both have significant impact on the detection of financial statement fraud. © BEIESP.","Beneish M Score; Detection; Factor; Forensic; Fraudulent; Statement",,,,,,,"(2019) Report to the Nations 2018 Global Study on Occupational Fraud and Abuse; Survai Fraud di Indonesia (2017) Indones.

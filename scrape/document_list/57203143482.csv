In order to find the effect of user in forms of UI, UX and GX on video games, a quick survey was done using Google Form for 60 participants and only 52 respondents which answer yes in question number 1, where 36 and 16 respondents are male and female respectively. The 52 respondents are spread into 4 range ages where 16, 24, 8 and 4 respondents are between ages 13-20, ages 21-30, ages 31-40 and age more than 41 respectively. The interesting thing is from 52 respondents 69.2%(36 respondents) are male and 46.2% (24 respondents) between age 21-30, 34.6% (18 respondents) have been playing Tekken games, 71.2% (37 respondents) have ever played tekken 7 console version. For 37 respondents (71.2% from 52 respondents) who ever played tekken 7 console version, 67.6% (25 respondents) very love with score 5 for the Tekken 7 main menu, 64.9% (24 respondents) are very love with score 5 for the Tekken 7 character game, 56.8% (21 respondents) are very love with score 5 for the Tekken 7 character customization, 62.2% (23 respondents) are very love with score 5 for the Tekken 7 gameplay UI. The survey shows that most of the player are male, range age between ages 21-30 and Tekken game version 7 is loved because having excellent UI, UX and GX. © 2017 IEEE.","Gameplay Experience; User Experience; User Interface; Video Games","Artificial intelligence; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; User interfaces; Gameplay; Gameplay experiences; User experience; User experiences (ux); Video game; Surveys",,,,,"Copier, M., Raessens, J., Dimensions and determinants of the enjoyment of playing digital games: A three-level model (2003) Level Up: Digital Games Research Conference, , Nov; Hunicke, R., LeBlanc, M., Zubek, R., Mda: A formal approach to game design and game research (2004) MDA: A Formal Approach to Game Design and Game Research, , http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/pubs/MDA.pdf, 2004.

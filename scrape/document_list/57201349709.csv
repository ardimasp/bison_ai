In this point, the Southbound policy represents Taiwan's government strategy in 2016-2020 which encourages multilateral and bilateral cooperation with ASEAN and South Asian countries. One of the most important elements in the program centers as the Internship Scholarship Program in Taiwan. Utilizing qualitative research methods, researchers collected secondary data from various available official resources. The publications, documents, books, and websites contain the policy and mechanism of the internship scholarship program. On the other hand, this study conducted interviews with senior high school and vocational high school stakeholders to create synergy in the program. This study offers a model of cooperation between junior high school/vocational school and the candidates of the employer in the Taiwan industry. The contribution of this research is to create a comprehensive cooperative model that includes preparing human resources before leaving for Taiwan, providing teachers and supplying training materials that are relevant to the needs of industry players in Taiwan eventually. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","industry; internship; Mandarin training model; southbound policy","Industry; Teaching; Bilateral cooperation; Cooperative model; internship; Junior high schools; Qualitative research methods; Scholarship program; Training material; Training model; Personnel training",,,,"Kementerian Riset, Teknologi dan Pendidikan Tinggi","We acknowledge the partial financial support of this research from research project grant of “Strategi Pengembangan Daerah Perbatasan di Kepulauan Riau dalam Rangka Implementasi Indonesia sebagai Poros Maritim Dunia (Strategy of Border Area Development in Riau Islands in the Framework of Implementation of Indonesia as a World Maritime Axis) ” by Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia.","(2017) New Southbound Policy Promotion Plan, , http://english.ey.gov.tw/News_Hot_Topic.aspx?n=D61190201622DA50amp;sms=B5449820D7077391, Retrieved July 15; Agastasia, I.G.B.D., Perwita, A.A.B., Jokowi's Maritime Axis: Change and Continuity of Indonesia's Role in Indo-Pacific (2015) Journal of ASEAN Studies, 3 (1), pp. 32-41. , 2015; Hutchinson, T., Waters, A., (1987) English for Specific Purposes: A Learning-centred Approach, , http://assets.cambridge.org/97805213/18372/excerpt/9780521318372_excerpt.pdf, (Cambridge University Press); John, M.S., Language for Special Purposes (2000) Annual Review of Applied Lingusitics, 20, pp. 59-76; Ruggiero, Diana, M., Graduate Courses in Languages for Specific Purposes: Needs, Challenges, and Models (2014) Global Business Languages, 19, pp. 55-69. , Article 5; Douglas, C., (2013) Languages for Specific Purposes in the 21st Century 2013, , https://www.actfl.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/TLE_pdf/TLE_Apr13_Article.pdf; Olga, K., Language for Specific Purposes: Methodological Problems, Trends and Perspectives (2015) Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 214, pp. 977-982. , (5 December 2015); Chien, Cheng-Chih, The effectiveness of interactive computer simulations on college engineering students' conceptual understanding and problemsolving ability related to circular motion (1997) Doctoral Dissertation, the Ohio State University Dissertation Abstracts International, 58, p. 2589A; Coil, R.A., (1998) Multiple Intelligences and Computer-assisted Learning with Adult Learners: An Examination of Learner Outcomes, 58, p. 4523A. , (The Union Institute University) Doctoral Dissertation Dissertation Abstracts International; Sharples, M., (2000) The Design of Personal Mobile Technologies for Lifelong Learning Computers and Education, 34, pp. 177-193; Sharples, M., Structured computer-based training and decision support in the Interpretation of neuroradiological images (2000) International Journal of Medical Informatics, 60 (3), p. 263. , 228-63 b; Anderson Ed Vrasidas, C., Glass, G.Y., Revealing the hidden curriculum of eLeaming (2002) Current Perspectives in Applied Information Technologies, , Anderson ed C Vrasidas and G Y Glass (Greenwich, CT: Information Age); Milrad, M., Mobile learning: Challenges, perspectives and reality (2002) Working Paper the Social Science of Mobile Learning Conference, , (Budapest: Institute of Philosophical Research of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences); Lehner, F., Nosekabel, H., Lehmann, H., (2001) Wireless E-learning and Communication Environment, , (Germany: University of Regensburg); Coil, R.A., (1998) Multiple Intelligences and Computer-assisted Learning with Adult Learners: An Examination of Learner Outcomes, 58, p. 4523A. , (The Union Institute University) Doctoral Dissertation Dissertation Abstracts International",,,"","Institute of Physics Publishing","4th International Conference on Friendly City 2017","11 October 2017 through 12 October 2017",,135340,17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The robot is controlled using computer networks, so the manager/supervisor can direct the robot to the intended person to start a discussion/inspection. People tracking and autonomous navigation are intelligent features of this robot using stereo vision. We build a web application for controlling the multi-client telepresence robot and open-source teleconference system used. Experimental result presented and we evaluated its performance. © 2012 Science Publications.","Intelligent robot; Robot vision; Stereo vision; Telepresence robot",,,,,,"Alers, S., Bloembergen, D., Hennes, D., Tuyls, K., (2011) Augmented mobile telepresence with assisted control, , Maastricht University; Braunl, T., (2008) Embedded Robotics: Mobile Robot Design, and Applications with Embedded Systems 3rd Edn., p. 542. , Springer, ISBN-10: 3540705333; Budiharto, W., Purwanto, D., Jazidie, A., A navigation system for service robot using stereo vision, and kalman filtering (2011) Proceedings of the 11th IEEE International Conference on Control, pp. 1771-1776. , Automation, and Systems, Oct. 26-29, IEEE Xplore Press, Gyeonggi-do; Budiharto, W., Santoso, D., Jazidie, A., A robust obstacle avoidance for service robot using Bayesian approach (2011) Int.

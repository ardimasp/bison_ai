At each stage of the process, this method centers around user to improve usability of a website and User Interface of an application. However, there are a few disadvantages of this method as mentioned in this research [1]. For that reason, we have made some improvements to the User-Centered Design method and perform a test on an e-learning website. These tests conclude that the proposed User-Centered Design method is better than the previous User-Centered Design method, with the result of SUS calculation showing grade 65.08 for the previous User-Centered Design method and grade 75.54 for the proposed User-Centered Design method. The t-Test results also indicate that there is a significant effect on the use of the proposed User-Centered Design method compared to the previous User-Centered Design method. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

In addition, this application also has a feature that provides information, tips and tricks in cat care. The research methods used to analyze the development of this application are literature study through books, journals and e-books. Furthermore, observation, distribution of questionnaires for data collection and interviews to ensure data accuracy. We also make comparisons with applications that have similar concepts and features similar to our application. The research method used for the development of this application is waterfall that has five stages, requirements definition, system and software design, implementation and unit testing, integration and system testing and operation and maintenance.

This application is designed by using a Waterfall Model, a 5-phase model that is Communication, Planning, Modeling, Construction, and Deployment starting from as the aforementioned steps. Based on the responds we get from distributing questionnaire, many people didn't know how to exercise properly and didn't bother to check the calories of their food.

At food stage section, players must collect vitamins and minerals from various food sources; if the players choose a wrong food, it will decrease vitamin and mineral bar. Meanwhile at tower defence section, vitamins are the heroes while minerals only affect the number of supplements. Players (heroes) that defense will automatically attack incoming enemies.

We assume that this model of humanoid robot is used as a service robot to deliver a cup to customer from starting point to destination point. We have successfully developed and introduced three main modules to recognize faces, to identify multiple moving obstacles and to initiate a maneuver. A group of people who are walking will be tracked as multiple moving obstacles. Predefined maneuver to avoid obstacles is applied to robot because the limitation of view angle from stereo camera to detect multiple obstacles. The contribution of this research is a new method for multiple moving obstacles avoidance strategy with Bayesian approach using stereo vision based on the direction and speed of obstacles. Depth estimation is used to obtain distance calculation between obstacles and the robot. We present the results of the experiment of the humanoid robot called Gatotkoco II which is used our proposed method and evaluate its performance. The proposed moving obstacles avoidance strategy was tested empirically and proved effective for humanoid robot. © 2013 Licensee InTech.","Bayesian approach; Humanoid service robot; Obstacles avoidance; Stereo vision","Bayesian approaches; Destination points; Distance calculation; Humanoid service robot; Indoor environment; Moving obstacles; Multiple moving obstacles; Obstacles avoidance; Bayesian networks; Mobile robots; Stereo vision; Anthropomorphic robots",,,,,"Acosta, L., González, E.J., Rodríguez, J.N., Hamilton, A.F., Méndez, J.A., Hernéndez, S., Sigut, S.M., Marichal, G.N., Design and implementation of a service robot for a restaurant (2006) International Journal of Robotics and Automation., 21 (4), pp. 273-281; Qing-Wiau, Y., Can, Y., Zhuang, F., Yan-Zheng, Z., Research of the localization of restaurant service robot (2010) International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems., 7 (3), pp. 227-238; Maier, D., Self-supervised obstacle detection for humanoid navigation using monocular vision and sparse laser data (2011) IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation., pp. 1263-1269; Masako, K., Daisu, K., Autonomous mobile robot navigation using active stereo vision (2000) Intelligent Autonomous Systems 6., pp. 1041-1048. , IOS Press; Purwanto, D., (2001) Visual Feedback Control in Multi-Degrees-of-Freedom Motion System., , PhD thesis at Graduate School of Science and Technology-Keio University, Japan; Etemad, K., Chellappa, R., Discriminant analysis for recognition of human face images (1997) Journal of the Optical Society of America A: Optics and Image Science, and Vision, 14 (8), pp. 1724-1733; Belhumeur, P.N., Kriegman, D.J., What Is the Set of Images of an Object under All Possible Illumination Conditions?

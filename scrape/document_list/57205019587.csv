In addition, in the E-Learning learning system we must also provide accurate and accurate information. The research method used is literature study and analysis. Literature study was carried out on the face of face detection and recognition in real-Time conditions carried out by various previous studies. Furthermore, analysis was carried out in a literature study studio to find suitable methods for the E-Learning environment. From the results of existing literature studies we recommend face detection using Face Countour and the Adaboost Algorithm added to CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)to normalize the facial contour function and normalize lightning in the surrounding environment where a face detection is located. The process is carried out, we use the 3WPCA-MD(Three-Level Wavelet Decomposition Principal Component Analysis with Mahalonobis Distance) method which is able to produce calculations, that is, face recognition that is faster when compared to ordinary PCA (Principal Component Analysis) methods. Thus the process can be carried out in face detection and face recognition. © 2018 IEEE.","e-learning; face recognition; facedetecton","Adaptive boosting; Authentication; Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Information management; Neural networks; Principal component analysis; Wavelet decomposition; Convolutional neural network; E-learning environment; Face detection and recognition; facedetecton; Literature reviews; Mahalonobis distance; PCA (principal component analysis); Surrounding environment; Face recognition",,,,,"Rabiha, S.G., Ham, S.H., Noerlina, Hendro, Image processing model based e-learning for students authentication (2017) International Conference on Information Management and Technology (ICIMTech, pp. 187-191. , no.

We review several methods that have been tried in the E-Learning system, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method. The results of the review it was found that face detection alone would be better if using Deep Convolutional Neural Network when compared to Local Binary Pattern. As for the effective feature recognition method for E-Learning is Deep-Learning, because the accuracy level generated by deep learning is very good at 95%, and the speed of the method for someone's technician requires only 1.7 ms (millisecond), Haar is good enough for used, but the resulting accuracy rate is only 68%, and the time required for someone's technician is 4s (second). © 2018 IEEE.","Detection; Face authenticaton; Recognition","Authentication; Deep neural networks; Error detection; Face recognition; Intelligent systems; Neural networks; Online systems; Accuracy level; Convolutional neural network; Face authentication; Face authenticaton; Feature recognition; Local binary patterns; Online learning; Recognition; E-learning",,,,,"Gianni, B.L.F., Mirko, M., A multi-biometric system for continuous student authentication in e-learning platforms (2016) Pattern Recognit.

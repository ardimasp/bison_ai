One way to reduce the cyber bullying is doing an earlier detection on it. Therefore, each of uploaded bullying content could be removed by an application of concerned. However, it is not an easy task to do this detection because of several reasons. First of all, the language form of the cyber bullying constructed is usually not in accordance with the formal language structure. As the result, the assessment of content cannot be processed per word individually, but in the contrary, it should include the whole sentence, including the punctuation marks, emoticons, and tagging. In other words, ones cannot rely on the rough/dirty word filtering in combating the cyber bullying, but rather have a tool that understands the bullying context within a sentence. Secondly, every language is different in how it is used in expressing its user mood. Thus, although there are reports on how machine learning successfully used in certain levels in combating cyber bullying in English, it does not mean that it can be used in other languages. In fact, the machine learning algorithm should work on the top of large and structured sets of texts of a certain language that can be stored and processed electronically called corpora. The ultimate goal is to propose a machine learning algorithm for combating cyber bullying in Bahasa Indonesia. Bahasa Indonesia corpora have been developed and will be tested using the existing machine learning algorithms that work in Indonesia, English, and Hindi. The data had been scraped and derived from social media during the 2017 Indonesian capital city governor election. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Classification; Corpora; Cyber bullying; Feature space design; Machine learning; Social media",,,,,,"Gati Gayatri, U.R., DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP SAFETY AMONG CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS IN INDONESIA (2015) Jurnal Penelitian Dan Pengembangan Komunikasi Dan Informatika, 6. , ISSN: 2087-0132; (2017) Cyberbullying: Citizen in 24 Countries Assess Bullying via Information Technology for a Total Global Perspective, , https://www.ipsos-na.com/download/pr.aspx?id=14179; Farisia, N., Deteksi Cyberbullying pada Media Sosial di Indonesia dengan Memanfaatkan Text Mining [tesis (2016) Jakarta: Pascasarjana Magister Teknik Informatika Universitas Indonesia; Dinakar, K., Reichart, R., Lieberman, H., Modeling the detection of textual cyberbullying (2011) The Social Mobile Web, 11 (2); Nahar, V., Li, X., Pang, C., An effective approach for cyberbullying detection (2013) Communications in Information Science and Management Engineering, 3 (5), p. 238; Desai, N., Dave, A.D., Sarcasm detection in hindi sentences using support vector machine (2016) International Journal, 4 (7); Mayfield, E., Penstein-Rose, C., Using feature construction to avoid large feature spaces in text classification (2010) Proceedings of the 12th Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation.

A lot of Indonesian media companies have transformed their business processes, from offline to online. The new business setting not only requires a set of revamped business processes through a business process reengineering but also a strong support from the information technology (IT) departments. The modernization and computerization of the new business processes require the company to have a lot of software projects that have such time and budget constraints. The company in this research has been experiencing a lot of unwanted overdue, both in their in-house and outsourced software projects. This paper studied the randomly picked 20 in-house software projects that adopting a certain software development methods such as software development life cycle (SDLC), Scrum, extreme programming (XP), and waterfall as well as the outsourced ones to see how effective they are to keep the software delivery on time. © 2017 IEEE.","project time-line; software development method; software development process","Budget control; Computer software; Reengineering; Business process re-engineering; EXtreme Programming; In-house software; Software development life cycle; Software development methods; Software development process; Technological growth; Time line; Software design",,,,,"Sommerville, I., Introduction to software engineering (2011) SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 9.

However, the cyberbullying that is believed has a negative effect on the victims bigger than the traditional one come as a price of this changing trend.

Secondly, the content must be understood from a specific context. In order to have such a tool to combat the cyberbullying, such model and tested algorithm should be made and confirmed by the linguists. This research develops a cyberbullying corpus in order to develop a supervised learning algorithm.

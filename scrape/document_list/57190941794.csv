There is also a global push to consider environmental factors and the sustainable development. The successful implementation of CSR activities of PT. Riau Andalan Pulp and Paper (RAPP) in Riau, Indonesia, is an example of a program based on business and ethical values. This case produced successful models for the CSR-based social enterprise. The hypothesis here is that the success of a social enterprise is due in part to underlying moral philosophy, such as how ideological entrepreneurship is implemented based on ideological, personal and local values. Without neglecting the search for the essence of business operations, which give space for community development and empowerment, this research also proves the influence of ideological entrepreneurship on the success of a social enterprise. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","business ethics; community development and empowerment; Corporate Social Responsibility; CSR-based social enterprise; ideological entrepreneurship","Philosophical aspects; Business ethics; Community development; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); ideological entrepreneurship; Social enterprise; Sustainable development; Commerce; Computer Programs; Development; Indonesia; Operations; Products; Research",,,,,"This research partially funded by Bina Nusantara Research Grant and Shibusawa Foundation Japan.","Mursitama, T.N., Hasan, M.F., Fakhrudin, I.Y., (2011) Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) di Indonesia Teori Dan Implementasi: Studi Kasus Community Development Riau Pulp, , (Jakarta: Institute for Development of Economics and Finance/INDEF); Gherghina, S.C., Simionescu, L.N., Does Entrepreneurship and Corporate Social Responsibility Act as Catalyst towards Firm Performance and Brand Value? in (2015) International Journal of Economics and Finance Issues, 7; Lee, M.P., A Review of the Theories of Corporate Social Responsibility: Its Evolutionary Path and the Road Ahead (2008) International Journal of Management Reviews, 10 (1), pp. 53-73; Dudovskiy, J., (2012) Criticism Associated with Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), , http://research-methodology.net/criticism-associated-with-corporate-social-responsibility-csr/, retrieved July 30, 2017; Timmons, J.A., (1994) New Venture Creation, Entrepreneurship for the 21st Century, , 4 (Barr Ridge II: Irwin press); Gruidl, J., Stout, B., Markley, D., (2009) An Introduction to Community Development, pp. 278-295. , Gruidl J, Stout B and Markley D ed R Phillips and R Pittman Entrepreneurship as a Community Development Strategy 2009; Covin, J.G., Miles, M.P., Corporate entrepreneurship and the pursuit of competitive advantage (1999) Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 23 (3), pp. 47-63; Zahra, S.A., Predictors and Financial Outcomes of Corporate Entrepreneurship: An Exploratory Study (1991) Journal of Business Venturing, 6; Niño, A.C.S., Social Entrepreneurship and Corporate Social Responsibility: Differences and Points in Common (2015) Journal of Business & Economic Policy, 2, pp. 85-93; Nash, M.T.A., (2016) The Jossey-Bass Handbook of Nonprofit Leadership and Management, , 4 (New Jersey: John Wiley amp; Sons, Inc.)

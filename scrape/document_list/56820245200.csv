To handle large projects that have a high level of complexity requires a leader or a project manager who has expertise in the field of power plant construction, has good leadership skills, and who is expected to be able to overcome the difficulties faced during the process of the project. This research was conducted using a qualitative method to analyze the leadership style of the project managers who had led the PLTU-XYZ project and also to investigate their leadership influence on the project management’s team performance. Data were collected by using in-depth interviews, which were then analyzed by using thematic-data analysis. The study discovered that the first project manager had an ‘affiliative’ leadership style, the second had a ‘pacesetting’ leadership style while the third had a ‘democratic’ leadership style. The affiliative leadership style and democratic leadership style brought positive effects to the project management team’s performance while the pacesetting leadership style brought negative effects to the project management team’s performance. This research also found that the leadership style of the project manager was not a factor that could cause delays in the project. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Leadership style; PLTU XYZ 2x30MW project; Project management",,,,,,"Special thanks to the IMHA 2018 committee members and UPM Pertanika Journal team, which have assisted to publish this article.","Armstrong, M., (2009) Armstrong’s handbook of management and leadership: A guide to managing for results, , (2nd ed).

Conducting a familiarization study is the topic under discussion. The research paradigm is interpretive and the methodology is qualitative. This leads to the key issue of the importance of undertaking a familiarization study before collecting data using the interview method since the researcher may fail to consider such issues as class, race, gender, ethnicity, and other factors. Inevitably the results may well reflect his or her views, rather than those of respondents. Therefore, a familiarization study is a critical component to the success of fieldwork. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

In a university, knowledge is an individual's property, especially tacit knowledge. To benefit from it and avoid the knowledge loss phenomenon, the management in the university must understand the drivers and the constraint factors of knowledge sharing. This study was conducted using a qualitative approach. Data were collected by inter viewing fourteen lecturers of Business Administration and Management study programs at three universities in Indonesia. The results show that there are forty-two antecedents and twentyeight barriers to knowledge sharing behavior, which can be classified into four categories comprised of personal, organizational, infrastructure and opportunity, and social contexts. The findings of the study suggest that management needs to develop an integrative strategy to encourage and motivate knowledge sharing behaviorsamong lecturers. © 2015 Serials Publications.","Antecedents of Knowledge Sharing; Knowledge Sharing; Knowledge Sharing Barriers",,,,,,,"Alavi, M., Leidner, D., Review: Knowledge management, and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations, and reseach issues (2001) MIS Quaterly, 25 (1), pp. 107-136; Bock, G., Kim, Y., Determinants of the individual's knowledg sharing behavior: The theory of reasoned action perspective (2002) The Pacific Asia Conference on Information System; Bock, G., Zmud, R., Kim, Y., Behavior intention formation in knowledge sharing: Examining the roles of extrinsic motivators, social-psychological forces, and organizational climate (2005) MIS Quaterly, 29 (1), pp. 89-111; Boer, N., Berends, H., Van Baalen, P., Relational models for knowledge sharing behavior (2011) European Management Journal, 29 (2), pp. 85-97; Bollinger, A., Smith, R.D., Managing organizational knowledge as strategic asset (2001) Journal of Knowledge Management, 5 (1), pp. 8-18; Burns, J., (1978) Leadership, , New York: Hacourt, Brace, & World; Cabrera, A., Collins, W.C., Saldago, J.F., Determinants of individual engagement in knowledge sharing (2006) The International Journal of Human Resource Management, 17 (2), pp. 245-264; Cheng, M.-Y., Ho, J.S., Lau, P.M., Knowledge sharing in academic institutions: A study of multimedia university Malaysia (2010) Electronic Journal of Knowledge Management, 7 (3), pp. 313-324; Connelly, C., Kelloway, E., Predictors of employees-perceptions of knowledge sharing cultures (2003) Leadership, and Organizaton Development Journal, 24 (5), pp. 294-301; Creswell, J.W., (2003) Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitatve, and Mixed Methods Approach, , Second ed.

Recently a new technique has been developed to test the taste of cocoa beans, namely the Metabolic Fingerprinting Technique. This technique observes the profile comparison of metabolite compounds to be applied in determining the similarities and differences between two or more samples. Since the experimental data may contain many uncertainty factors, such as measurement error, changes in lab environment, and so forth, the fuzzy clustering technique would give the appropriate answer. As a result, a set of metabolic fermentation data from several cocoa beans will be grouped by the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm (FCM). FCM is a grouping technique where the existence of each data point in a cluster is determined by the degree of membership. This algorithm is based on the minimization of objective functions illustrated by finding the shortest distance between the center of the group and each data point weighted by the degree of membership. Furthermore, the most optimal cluster will be determined by using the Xie-Beni Index. © 2020 IJSTR.","Cluster; Cocoa beans; Fermentation; Fuzzy c-Means clustering; Metabolic fingerprinting technique; Metabolite compounds; Xie-Beni index",,,,,,"Gu, F., Tan, L., Wu, H., Fang, Y., Xu, F., Chu, Z., Wang, Q., Comparison of Cocoa Beans from China, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (2013) Foods, 2, pp. 183-197; Ellis, D.I., Brewster, V.L., Dunn, W.B., Allwood, J.W., Golovanov, A.P., Goodacre, R., Fingerprinting food: Current technologies for the detection of food adulteration and contamination (2012) Published in Chemical Society Reviews; Lisec, J., Schauer, N., Kopka, J., Gas chromatography mass spectrometry–based metabolite profiling in plants (2006) Nat Protoc, 1, pp. 387-396; Pandey, A., Soccol, C.R., Mitchell, D., New Developments in Solid State Fermentation: I-Bioprocesses and Products, 35 (10), pp. 1153-1169. , Elsevier.

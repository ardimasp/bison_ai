The city and regency of Cirebon were selected in this study to see the potential and the obstacles that occur to make these areas as tourist destination. Kertajati international airport is available, dozens of tourist destinations both for enjoying culinary, historical, religious sites, supporting adequate intercity and local transportation, and so on. The main problem for Cirebon for tourists who will or are visiting the city is the specific and clear information about the destination. The opportunity and obstacles to find the best solution are evaluated through the Value Shop system. The need for a mobile application framework that is well developed and backed with comprehensive data is proposed. The design of the application framework uses the OOAD process. It is hoped that this application framework will make it easy for prospective travelers to feel comfortable toward what they can get from the city and regency of Cirebon. In addition, the Population and the government of Cirebon city and regency will be able to boost their wealth. © 2020 IEEE.","Mobile application; The city and regency of cirebon; Tourism; Value shop","Information management; Application frameworks; International airport; Mobile applications; Tourism activities; Tourist destinations; Mobile computing",,,,,"Purnawati, T., Rute dan Maskapai Bertambah, Penumpang Pesawat Dari Kertajati Meningkat Akhir Tahun 2019 (2019) Pikiran Rakyat, , https://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/jawa-barat/pr-01326974/rute-danmaskapai-bertambah-penumpang-pesawat-dari-bandara-kertajatimeningkat-akhir-tahun-2019, 20 Desember Accessed on February 10 2020; (2020) Kemenag Pastikan Bandara Kertajati Layani Penerbangan Ibadah Haji 2020, , https://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/bandung-raya/pr-01326725/kemenag-pastikan-bandara-kertajati-layani-penerbanganibadah-haji-2020, Sarnapi Pikiran Rakyat, 9 Desember Accessed on February 10, 2020; (2020) 19 Tempat Wisata di Cirebon Terbaru Yang Menarik Dikunjungi, , https://wisatalengkap.com/tempat-wisata-di-cirebon-terbaru/, Accessed on February 13; Kroenke, D.M., Boyle, R.J., (2018) Using Mis, , 10th Edition, Global Edition, Pearson; Guemide, B., Benachaiba, C., Maouche, S., Integrating ICT-based applications dor sustainable tourism development in Algeria Journal of Tourism & Hospitality.

However, it is still difficult to obtain adequate healthcare services in Indonesia. Many of Indonesian have chosen to seek treatment in neighboring countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Australia. As a result, a lot of foreign exchange flows into those countries. Such problems exist in health support efforts. The scarcity of human resources, especially in the field of highly capable nursing, is a field that will be cultivated by the Summit. The other problems in the field of nursing training make it necessary for the Summit to be clever in integrating strategies, the business processes with the use of information system and technology. The variety of competition and tight government regulations forced the Summit to continue to exist and to be able to compete in the future using information systems and technology. For this reason, Summit uses the EA3 Enterprise Architecture Framework approach so that challenges can be overcome while taking advantage of opportunities and gaining competitive advantage. It is hoped that with this design of the information system and technology strategy, investment in the field can be directed and the business objectives that have been set can be achieved. © 2020 IEEE.","Enterprise architecture; Information system and technology; Nursing education services; Strategy design","Competition; Information management; Information systems; Laws and legislation; Nursing; Business objectives; Competitive advantage; Enterprise Architecture; Government regulation; Healthcare services; Improving performance; Information systems and technologies; Technology strategies; Information use",,,,,"Mahendradhata, Y., The republic of Indonesia health system review (2017) World Health Organization; Media, K.C., (2020) Pasar Terbesar di ASEAN, Bagaimana Peluang Industri Kesehatan Indonesia?, , KOMPAS.com; Egeham, L., (2019) HEADLINE: Lompatan Jokowi Untuk Indonesia Maju, Bagaimana Pelaksanaannya?, , liputan6.com, Aug. 17; Martin, L., Nursing skills: Is there a shortage?

In contrary, the increasing of the ICT usage is not followed by the increasing of the green ICT awareness and behavior. Our previous research on Private higher education institution practice of green information technology governance model had resulted some obstruction on the implementation. One of the most crucial aspect among others is the government policies and regulations deficiencies.

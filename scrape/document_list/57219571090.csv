So far, the election has been done manually where the election documents before and after the election are distributed from the polling station to the central office and vice versa about the election results so that the selection process is less effective and efficient. This study aims to create a block chain model for regional elections in Indonesia that will ensure the accuracy of regional head election data. The research method uses observations about the mechanism of regional head election, followed by design using the block chain theory. The resulting model is tested for validity to get input from political observers © 2020 IEEE.","Block chain; Election; Model","Information management; Central offices; Indonesia; Regional government; research methods; Blockchain",,,,,"Law Number 10 Year 2016 concerning the Election of Governors, Regents and Mayors, , Republic of Indonesia; Holotescu, C., Understanding Block Chain Opportunities and Challenges, Conference: International Scientific Conference on ELearning and Software for Education, , At Bucharest, Romania; Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-toPeer Electronic Cash System; Early warning system for infectious diseases 2015 9th International Conference on Telecommunication Systems Services and Applications (TSSA), , Inayatulloh; Crosby, M., Pattanayak, P., Verma, S., (2016) BlockChain Technology: Beyond Bitcoin, Applied Innovation Review; Thalheim, B., The conception of the model (2013) Business Information Systems: 16th International Conference, BIS, pp. 113-124. , Poznan, Poland, June 19-21, 2013.

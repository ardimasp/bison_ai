Especially along with the great development of Deep Learning. Video-based Sign Language Recognition is our concern because we want to recognize a sign not only by the shape but also by the action the signer does. The problem is sign language is very complex and vary. The variation of sign language is making the system harder to recognize all the words accurately. Many researchers have been researching Sign Language Recognition for a long time. So many methods had been used to find out which one is the best method. Because of similarity between Sign Language Recognition and Action Recognition, we are trying to implement one of the top-tier models in Action Recognition which is i3d inception this model is also a new Action Recognition model with very high accuracy. So we can know is it possible to adopt Action Recognition behavior into Sign Language Recognition. The goal of this paper is to implement the i3d inception model to Sign Language Recognition with transfer learning method. From the test we've been done, we got 100% accuracy on training with 10 words and 10 signers with 100 classes but the validation accuracy is pretty low. This model is too overfit. © 2018 IEEE.","comparation; convolutional neural network; deep learning; recognition; sign language","Behavioral research; Convolution; Deep learning; Neural networks; Action recognition; comparation; Convolutional neural network; High-accuracy; recognition; Sign language; Sign Language recognition; Transfer learning methods; Pattern recognition",,,,,"This research was supported by Research Grant No. 036/CR.RTT/IV/2018from Ministry of Research Technology and Higher Education of Republic of Indonesia.","(2018) Deaf Cambridge Dictionary, , https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/deaf, Retrieved from Cambridge Dictionary; Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L., Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database (2009) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009.

While it is popular, most people don't know how to use it. The problem lies in the difficulty of how many signs there to be memorized. That's why Sign Language Recognition (SLR) is needed. Sign Language Recognition (SLR) is a very interesting area for some researcher because of the complexity of its problem especially using video-based recognition of complex sign language. That's why Sign Language Recognition (SLR) has been developed for a long time. Unfortunately, every research about Sign Language Recognition has its own limitation. Some research got low accuracy, too expensive, insufficient dataset, and many other else. Every researcher also has their own way of doing a thing but usually, the pattern in Sign Language Recognition (SLR) are dataset collection, preprocessing data, feature extraction, training, and classification. For the dataset, we will use Argentina Sign Language that provides data as video. After that, we need to preprocess it using edge detection and skin detection using the help of Contrast Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for image enhancement. Then we will extract its feature by its movement. At last, we will train and classify the data using some modified Hidden Markov Model. In this research, we get an accuracy of 83% by classifying 10 signs using Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (Gaussian HMM) and 72% by classifying 10 signs using Multinomial Hidden Markov Model (Multinomial HMM). © 2018 IEEE.","comparation; hidden markov model; machine learning; recognition; sign language","Classification (of information); Edge detection; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Object recognition; Technology transfer; Trellis codes; Adaptive histogram equalization; Communication techniques; comparation; Gaussian-HMM; recognition; Sign language; Sign Language recognition; Skin Detection; Hidden Markov models",,,,,,"Suharjito, A.R., Wiryana, F., Ariesta, M.C., Kusuma, G.P., Sign language recognition application systems for deaf-mute people: A review based on input-process-output (2017) 2nd International Conference on Computer Science and Computational Intelligence; Wang, H., Chai, X., Zhou, Y., Fast, C.X., (2015) Sign Language Recognition Benefited from Low Rank Approximation; Shaik, K.B., Ganesan, P., Kalist, V., Sathish, B.S., Jenitha, J.M.M., Comparative study of skin color detection and segmentation in HSV and YCbCr color space (2015) 3rd International Conference on Recent Trends in Computing; Kumar, P., Gauba, H., Roy, P.P., Dogra, D.P., Coupled HMM-based multi-sensor data fusion for sign language recognition (2016) Pattern Recognition Letters.; Raheja, J.L., Minhas, M., Prashanth, D., Shah, T., Chaudhary, A., Robust genture recognition using kinect: A comparison between DTW and HMM (2015) Elsevier; Li, T.H.S., Kao, M.C., Kuo, P.H., (2015) Recognition System for Home-Service-Related Sign Language Using Entropy-Based K-Means Algorithm and ABC-Based HMM; Yadar, G., Maheshwari, S., Agarwal, A., (2014) Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equilization Based Enchancement for Real Time Video System; Fatmi, R., Rashad, S., Integlia, R., Hutchison, G., (2017) American Sign Language Recognition Using Hidden Markov Models and Wearable Motion Sensors; Rautaray, S.S., Agrawal, A., Vision based hand gesture recognition for human computer interaction: A survey (2015) Artificial Intelligence Review, 43 (1), pp. 1-54; Tharwat, A., Gaber, T., Hassanien, A.E., Shahin, M.K., Refaat, B., Sift-based Arabic sign language recognition system (2015) Afro-european Conference for Industrial Advancement, pp. 359-370. , Springer, Cham; Fok, K.Y., Ganganath, N., Cheng, C.T., Chi, K.T., A real-time asl recognition system using leap motion sensors (2015) Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery (CyberC), 2015 International Conference on, pp. 411-414. , IEEE; Savur, C., Sahin, F., Real-time American sign language recognition system using surface emg signal (2015) Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA), 2015 IEEE 14th International Conference on, pp. 497-502. , IEEE; Lee, G.C., Yeh, F.H., Hsiao, Y.H., Kinect-based Taiwanese sign-language recognition system (2016) Multimedia Tools and Applications, 75 (1), pp. 261-279; Zhang, J., Zhou, W., Xie, C., Pu, J., Li, H., Chinese sign language recognition with adaptive HMM (2016) Multimedia and Expo (ICME), 2016 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 1-6. , IEEE; Wu, J., Sun, L., Jafari, R., A wearable system for recognizing American sign language in real-time using IMU and surface EMG sensors (2016) IEEE J.
